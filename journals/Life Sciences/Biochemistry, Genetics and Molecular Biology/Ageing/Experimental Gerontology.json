     "abstract": "Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by decreasing functional reserves and increasing vulnerability to falls, injuries and declining health, leading to dependence upon caregivers. Frailty is associated not only with physical decline, but also with cognitive and psychological impairments in aging people. Higher serum adiponectin concentration has been linked to better performance on frailty measures but also to worse cognitive status. Nonetheless, several studies have proposed adiponectin as a frailty biomarker. To further delineate the relationship between adiponectin serum levels and frailty-related parameters, we studied a population of 112 long-term nursing home residents (aged 84.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.7) and analyzed their serum adiponectin levels in conjunction with frailty-related parameters including body composition, physical fitness, cognitive function, psychological parameters and quality of life. Frailty was assessed following the Fried Frailty Criteria, the Clinical Frailty Scale and the Tilburg Frailty Indicator.In women, higher serum adiponectin levels were associated with lower body weight, body mass index, body fat mass, fat mass/height2, lean mass, lean mass/height2 and smaller waist circumference and hip circumference (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). In men, the association was positive (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) between serum adiponectin and percentage of fat mass and negative between serum adiponectin and percentage of lean mass. Interestingly, in men, better cognitive function was inversely related to adiponectin (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) while decreased anxiety was linked to a higher concentration of adiponectin in women (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). According to the Tilburg Frailty Indicator, frail men had lower levels of adiponectin than those who were not frail (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Variables that predicted adiponectin concentration in multiple regression models were different for women and men. In women, lean mass and anxiety were independent negative predictors of blood adiponectin (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.363, p\u202f=\u202f0.002; \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.204, p\u202f=\u202f0.067, respectively). In men, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test was the only parameter to remain significant in the regression model (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u2212439, p\u202f=\u202f0.015).The results of our study show that adiponectin is linked to body composition, cognitive function and anxiety in long-term nursing home residents with differential relationships by sex. Further studies should be conducted to determine whether adiponectin is a valid and reliable frailty biomarker.",

     "abstract": "Although combining classical resistance (RT) and power training (PT) might be an efficient strategy to achieve optimal enhancements in body composition and physical function in older adults, the most effective approach to combine these different types of exercise training is still unknown. Periodization, an organizational model that refers to a succession of cycle that will vary in exercise intensity and/or volume to allow for the training stimulus to remain biologically challenging and effective, may represent an interesting approach. Among the different types of periodization, daily undulating periodization (DUP) has attracted considerable attention given its superiority in comparison to nonperiodized (NP) RT programs to elicit neuromuscular improvements in young adults. However, whether a DUP program combining PT and traditional RT can produce similar or greater improvements in body composition and physical function in older adults than a NP RT program has not yet been established. Therefore, the present study compared the effects of a DUP and NP programs on body composition and physical function in healthy community-dwelling older women.Forty-two older women (60\u201379\u202fyears) were randomized into one of the three experimental groups: NP, DUP, and control group (CG). Body composition and physical function were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. The sessions of exercises were performed twice a week over 22\u202fweeks. In NP, the two exercise sessions were based on three sets of 8\u201310 repetitions at a \u201cdifficult\u201d intensity (i.e., 5\u20136) prescribed based on the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. In DUP, the first session was based on PT (three sets of 8\u201310 repetitions at a \u201cmoderate\u201d intensity, i.e., 3, performed as fast as possible), while the second session was similar to the NP.There were no significant changes in body composition in any of the groups. Relative to baseline, participants assigned to NP showed significant improvements in countermovement jump (+55.7%), timed \u201cUp and Go\u201d (TUG) test (\u221243.2%, faster), walking speed (+12.0%), and one-leg-stand (+154.5%). In contrast, DUP only improved TUG performance (\u221253.2%, faster).NP and DUP improved physical function in community-dwelling older women, with greater improvements in physical parameters only observed after NP.",

We investigated the hypothesis that resistance training would increase muscle mass and strength together with a concomitant drop in local and systemic inflammation level independent of any changes in visceral fat tissue in elderly.25 subjects (mean 67, range 62\u201370\u202fyears) were randomized to 1\u202fyear of heavy resistance training (HRT) or control (CON), and tested at 0, 4 and 12\u202fmonths for physical performance, body composition (DXA), vastus lateralis muscle area (MRI) local and systemic inflammation (blood and muscle). In addition, systemic and local muscle immunological responses to acute exercise was determined before and after the training period.Increases in muscle mass (\u22482%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05), vastus lateralis area (\u22489%. P\u202f<\u202f0.05), isometric (\u224815%) and dynamic (\u224815%) muscle strength (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) were found in the HRT group after 12\u202fmonths\u202ftraining. HRT did not alter overall or visceral fat mass (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Blood C-Reactive Protein declined over time in both groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), whereas muscle inflammation markers were unchanged to 1\u202fyear of HRT. Acute exercise increased plasma IL-6 and FGF-19 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), decreased FGF-21 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and CCL-20 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), and increased GDNF in muscle (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) similarly before and after 1\u202fyear in both groups.Long term resistance training increased muscle strength and improved muscle mass, but did not alter visceral fat mass and did not show any specific effect upon resting or exercise induced markers of inflammation.",

     "abstract": "Ageing is defined as the gradual decline of normal physiological functions in a time-dependent manner. Significant progress has been made in characterising the regulatory processes involved in the mechanisms of ageing which would have been hindered without the use of model organisms. Use of alternative model organisms greatly diversifies our understanding of different factors underpinning the ageing process and the potential translation for human application. Unique characteristics make Daphnia an attractive model organism for research into mechanisms underlying ageing, such as transparent body, short generation time, well-characterised methylome, regenerative capabilities and available naturally occurring ecotypes. Most interestingly, genetically identical female and male Daphnia have evolved different average lifespans, providing a unique opportunity for understanding the underlying mechanisms of ageing and regulation of lifespan. Investigating sex differences in longevity could provide insight into principal mechanisms of ageing and lifespan regulation. In this study we provide evidence in support of establishing genetically identical female and male Daphnia as unique and valuable resources for research into mechanisms of ageing and begin to delineate the mechanisms involved in sex differences in lifespan. We identify significant differences between genders in physiological markers such as lifespan, growth rate, heart rate and swimming speed in addition to molecular markers such as lipid peroxidation product accumulation, thiol content decline and age-dependent decline in DNA damage repair efficiency. Overall, our data indicates that investigating sex differences in longevity in the clonal organism Daphnia under controlled laboratory conditions can provide insight into principal mechanisms of ageing and lifespan regulation.",

     "abstract": "The stability and variability of older adults' late-differentiated peripheral blood T and natural killer (NK) cells over time remains incompletely quantified or understood. We examined the variability and change over time in T and NK cell subsets in a longitudinal sample of older adults; the effects of sex, cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, and chronic disease severity on immune levels and trajectories; and interdependencies among T and NK cell subsets. Older adults (N\u202f=\u202f149, age 64\u201394\u202fyears, 42% male) provided blood every 6\u202fmonths for 2.5\u202fyears (up to 5 waves) to evaluate late-differentiated CD8 T cells (CD28\u2212, CD57+) and CD56dimNK cells (CD57+, NKG2C+, Fc\u025bRI\u03b3\u2212). In multilevel models, most of the variance in immune subsets reflected stable differences between people. However, CD56dimNK cell subsets (CD57+ and Fc\u025bRI\u03b3\u2212) also increased with age, whereas T cell subsets did not. Independent of age, all subsets examined were higher in CMV-positive older adults. Men had higher levels of CD56dim CD57+ than women. Chronic disease was not associated with any immune subset investigated. T and NK cell subsets correlated within each cell type, but interdependencies differed by CMV serostatus. Our results suggest the accumulation of these stable cell populations may be driven less by chronological aging, even less by chronic disease severity, and more by CMV, which may differentially skew T and NK cell differentiation.",

     "abstract": "Although resistance type exercise training (RT) effectively increases muscle mass and strength in older individuals, it remains unclear whether gains in muscle mass and strength are maintained without continued supervised training. We assessed the capacity of older individuals to maintain muscle mass and strength gains one year after partaking in a successful RT program.Fifty-three healthy older adults performed a 24-wk supervised RT program. Upon the cessation of the training program, participants were not provided with any advice or incentives to continue exercise training. One year after completion of the training program, all participants were contacted and invited back to the laboratory to assess anthropometrics, body composition (DXA), quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) (CT-scan), muscle strength (1RM knee extension/leg press), and muscle fiber characteristics (muscle biopsy). Following primary analyses on all participants that responded to the invitation (n\u202f=\u202f35), participants were divided into two groups: individuals who had continued to perform exercise training on an individual basis (EXER group; n\u202f=\u202f16) and individuals who had not continued to perform any regular exercise (STOP group; n\u202f=\u202f19) after completing the RT program.The initial increases in quadriceps CSA (+506\u202f\u00b1\u202f209 and +584\u202f\u00b1\u202f287\u202fmm2) and knee extension strength (+32\u202f\u00b1\u202f12 vs +34\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fkg) after the 24-wk RT program did not differ between the STOP and EXER group (all P\u202f>\u202f0.05). One year after discontinuation of the RT program, participants had lost muscle mass (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), with a greater decline in quadriceps CSA in the STOP vs EXER group (\u2212579\u202f\u00b1\u202f268 vs \u2212309\u202f\u00b1\u202f253\u202fmm2, respectively; P\u202f<\u202f0.05).

Furthermore, from a physiopathological point of view, several authors describe an association between oxidative stress, hypoxia and these metabolic conditions.It had been suggested that adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction, senescent cell accumulation and proinflammatory pathways may be involved in this processes.The purpose of this study was to develop an in vitro model to study the progressive morphological and functional changes of adipocytes with aging, in standard culture conditions and after severe hypoxia and hydrogen peroxide treatment. We evaluated the degree of apoptosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation as well as the gene expression profile of aging adipocytes.Our results show that aged adipocytes become senescent, undergo apoptosis, accumulate ROS, and present an inflammatory profile with an increase in mRNA expression level of key proteins related to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Aged adipocytes present increased levels of p53, p21 and p16, key regulators of senescence, and a decrease in SIRT-1 protein compared to younger cells. Moreover, adipocytes aged in hypoxia or in oxidative stress conditions represent a model of accelerated aging with a decrease in their area, a greater proportion of apoptotic and of intracellular ROS accumulation compared to controls.This study characterizes the progressive morphological and functional changes in aging adipocytes during prolonged cell cultures and explores the addictive effects of hypoxia and oxidation, given at different stages of cellular maturation and senescence.",

     "abstract": "Task-specific exercises such as bench stepping can improve functional ability and reduce falling incidents in older adults. However, such exercises are often not optimized to improve muscle volume and force-velocity characteristics. This study determined the effects of a 12-week stepping program using incremental step heights (STEEP), on muscle volume, strength, power, functional ability and balance performance in older women.Forty-five community-dwelling women (69y\u202f\u00b1\u202f4) were randomly assigned to the STEEP group or a non-training CONTROL group. Training intensity was primarily determined by step height, while training volume remained equal. Thigh muscle volume (CT-scan), force-velocity characteristics of the knee extensors (Biodex dynamometer) and functional ability (Short Physical Performance Battery, timed stair ascent, 10-m walk test and countermovement jump height) were determined pre- and post-intervention. In addition, 3D trunk accelerations were recorded at the lower back to assess balance during the Short Physical Performance Battery balance tests.Two-way ANOVA showed that the STEEP program increased thigh muscle volume, knee extensor isometric peak torque, dynamic peak power, unloaded rate of velocity development and improved performance on all functional tests to a greater extent than CONTROL (p\u202f<\u202f.05), except the countermovement jump. No improvements were found for peak velocity and balance performance (p\u202f>\u202f.05).Our results indicate that bench step training with incremental step heights simultaneously improves functional ability, thigh muscle volume and force-velocity characteristics of the knee extensors in older women.",

The SF-36 summary component scores (physical and mental component summary scale scores) of malnourished patients were significantly lower than patients at risk of malnutrition or normal (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). There were significant positive correlations between SF-36 physical component summary scale scores were significantly correlated with MNA scores (r\u202f=\u202f0.517), BMI (r\u202f=\u202f0.140) and daily dietary macronutrient intake (energy (r\u202f=\u202f0.328), protein (r\u202f=\u202f0.165), carbohydrate (r\u202f=\u202f0.305), fat (r\u202f=\u202f0.275) and fiber (r\u202f=\u202f0.268)) (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).

Senescence may affect endothelial cells, subsequently involved in the most common age-related diseases (ARDs), as well as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with an impairment of their properties in tissues regeneration. Endothelial cells seem to be able to exert a paracrine effect on BM-MSCs through the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. This work is aimed to evaluate if the senescent status of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) could affect bone marrow derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) proliferative ability and stemness. HUVECs were cultured until the senescence status. Young (passage 3) and senescent HUVECs (passage 13) were indirectly co-cultured with BM-MSCs for 8\u202fdays in order to evaluate the effect of their senescence status on proliferative ability and stemness of MSCs. The co-culture of senescent HUVECs with BM-MSCs was associated with a reduced proliferative ability of BM-MSCs, an enforced pro-inflammatory phenotype of BM-MSCs (increased synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and an increased expression of miR-126a-3p, in association with a significant decrease of SOX2, a stemmness- associated gene, targeted by miR-126a-3p. A more general IPA analysis, revealed as miR-126a-3p also modulates the expression of IRS1, IRS2, IL6ST and PIK3R2, all targets that enforce the hypothesis that senescent endothelial cells may reduce the proliferative ability and the stemness phenotype of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.",

     "abstract": "Ageing is a progressive deterioration in functional and structural well-being of the body, accompanied with age-associated neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. PD is marked with motor function decline, progressive neurodegeneration due to aggregation of insoluble \u03b1-synuclein in the dopaminergic neuron. Here we investigated the effect of tambulin (3,5-dihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl) chromen-4-one), a hydroxy substituted flavanol isolated from fruits of Zanthoxyllum armatum DC (Family-Rutaceae) for its longevity promoting and neuromodulatory activities using Caenorhabditis elegans model system. Our results show that tambulin treatment significantly enhance lifespan and stress tolerance in worms, along with mitigation of ageing biomarkers like lipofuscin and protein carbonyl. In line with the alleviated ROS levels, tambulin treatment led to upregulated mRNA expression of ROS scavenging genes viz., sod-1, sod-3, and ctl-2. Upregulation in daf-16 gene indicates the involvement of insulin signaling pathway in tambulin mediated longevity. Tambulin treatment exhibited curtailed PD manifestations in terms of reduced \u03b1-synuclein levels, lipid accumulation, improved locomotary behavior and dopamine levels. Altogether, our data suggest that tambulin mediated alleviation of PD manifestations possibly involved PD counter protective machinery as evident through upregulated mRNA expression of lagr-1, ymel-1, pdr-1, ubc-12, and lrk-1.Our studies present tambulin as a potential molecule for its properties against ageing and Parkinson's disease. Further studies are speculated to realize the mechanistic and pharmacological aspects of tambulin.",

     "abstract": "Polypharmacy, defined through the number of medications prescribed, has been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes in people with dementia. It is however unclear whether a numerical threshold of concurrently prescribed drugs is a suitable predictor for cognitive decline. We aimed to test associations between polypharmacy and both short-term (six months) and long-term (three years) cognitive trajectories in patients with incident dementia. Using data from a large mental health and dementia care database in South London, a cohort of 12,148 patients (mean age\u202f=\u202f80.7\u202fyears, 61.1% female, mean MMSE\u202f=\u202f18.6) clinically diagnosed with dementia was identified. We determined the number of medications prescribed at dementia diagnosis and defined two exposure groups: polypharmacy (5\u20139 medication) and excessive polypharmacy (\u226510 medications), with 0\u20134 medications as reference group. All Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores between one year before and three years after dementia diagnosis were ascertained. Effects of polypharmacy on cognitive decline were studied using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape and Linear Mixed Estimation Models. At the time of dementia diagnosis polypharmacy was present in 3503 (28.8%) patients and excessive polypharmacy in 1235 (10.2%) patients. In all three groups MMSE scores initially improved after dementia diagnosis and further decline was detected in the time interval from six months to three years after dementia diagnosis. No significant differences to the control group were found in relation to polypharmacy or excessive polypharmacy, neither in the initial cognitive improvement nor long-term decline. In conclusion, polypharmacy defined by the number of drugs does not appear to predict cognitive decline in a naturalistic cohort of patients with dementia. More sophisticated tools, considering appropriateness of prescribing and the clinical picture, might be better placed to evaluate cognitive outcomes in dementia and to make practice and research recommendations.",

We aim to describe and quantify time trends of fall-related healthcare use and mortality among adults aged \u226565\u202fyears in the Netherlands, 1997\u20132016.Data were extracted from the Dutch Injury Surveillance System, Dutch Hospital Discharge Registry, and Cause-of-Death Statistics Netherlands, by age, sex, diagnosis, injury location, and year.Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates of fall-related Emergency Department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and fatalities, as well as average length of hospital stay (LOS) were calculated.Between 1997 and 2016, absolute numbers of fall-related ED visits increased by 48%, hospital admissions increased by 59%, and mortality showed an almost threefold increase. These absolute numbers doubled among adults aged \u226585\u202fyears. A shift in fall-related injury diagnosis was observed over the years with a growing share of skull/brain injuries. In contrast to the increase in absolute numbers, standardized incidence rates of ED visits decreased by 30% (p\u202f=\u202f0.00), whereas incidence rates of hospital admissions and mortality did not significantly change over time. Furthermore, the absolute number of hospital admission days almost halved, due to a reduced average LOS from 18.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 18.2\u201318.8) days (1997) to 6.1 (95% CI, 6.1\u20136.2) days (2016).Even though the standardized incidence rates of ED visits decreased in the past twenty years, the absolute number of fall-related ED visits increased. The number of hospital admissions has also increased, but the total number of admission days has almost halved during the same period. If the observed trends would continue, this may have implications for healthcare resource allocation, as the burden of care in EDs increases, and the admission duration reduces.",

Recent evidences suggest that periodontitis is a possible risk factor for progression of AD and lipopolysaccharide derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg-LPS) which is a major periodontopathic bacteria induces cognitive impairment in mice. However, the precise relationships between the brain exposure of Pg-LPS and systemic organ dysfunction in AD patients are still undetermined. In this study, we investigated whether brain exposure of Pg-LPS induced systemic organ dysfunction in a model of AD mouse. We employed 6 (young) and 13 (middle-aged) months-old 5XFAD mice and 6\u202fmonths-old littermate (LT) mice, and treated with intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of 2\u202f\u03bcg Pg-LPS or saline (vehicle). The animals were monitored cognitive functions (Y maze, nest building, and Morris water maze tests), motor functions (wire hang and rotarod tests), physical condition (symptom score), and blood pressure (BP). Twenty-eight days later, their organs were weighted and the organ damages were examined. Continuous ICV injection of 2\u202f\u03bcg/day Pg-LPS increased ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1) and cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) positive cells in periventricular area of 5XFAD mice without enhancement of cognitive impairment, amyloid \u03b2 protein deposition, expressions of phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In addition, the Pg-LPS lowered the latency of rotarod test in young 5XAD mice and also reduced symptom score and weight of gastrocnemius muscle in the middle-aged animals. Moreover, the Pg-LPS induced cardiac atrophy in both young and middle-aged 5XFAD mice, and increased Iba-1 positive cells in left ventricle of the young animals. On the other hand, single ICV injection of 2\u202f\u03bcg Pg-LPS in 5XFAD and continuous injection of 2\u202f\u03bcg/day Pg-LPS in LT mice did not show any positive findings.

Interventions that promote lysosomal activity and acidification are thus of prime interest as treatments for longevity and health. Intracellular pH can be controlled by the exchange of protons for inorganic ions, and in cells from microbes to man, when potassium is restricted in the growth medium, the cytoplasm becomes acidified. Here we use a yeast model to show that potassium limited-cells exhibit hallmarks of increased acidity in the vacuole, the analog of the lysosome, and live long by a mechanism that requires the vacuolar machinery. The emerging picture is one in which potassium restriction shores up vacuolar acidity and function, conferring health benefits early in life and extending viability into old age. Against the backdrop of well-studied protein and carbohydrate restrictions that extend lifespan and healthspan, our work establishes a novel pro-longevity paradigm of inorganic nutrient limitation.",

     "abstract": "The increase of prevalence of mental health problems in the elderly due to the aging of the population becomes an outstanding issue since in most individuals it happens in an already complex multimorbid scenario that may include frailty and age-related medical conditions. Depression, soon the major cause of global disease burden, can be found as an age-related comorbidity and frailty, or as part of neurodegenerative diseases and where females are more vulnerable to it. Thought the multifactorial aetiology and heterogeneous nature of depression render it difficult to be modelled in animals, active behaviours elicited in the Forced Swimming Test (FST) are used to screen antidepressant treatments. However, interpretation of immobility remains controversial. The present work addressed this issue in very-old (21\u202fmonths) female C57bl/6\u202f\u00d7\u202f129 mice, also with the concern that a \u20186 minutes\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 days\u2019 protocol can result demanding for a very-old animal and confounding factors may also arise. Animals were behaviourally assessed for sensorimotor functions, emotionality and anxiety-like behaviours, novelty seeking, and immobility in a 2-days FST. The predictive value of the first day evidenced that one single assay as sufficient for the assessment of immobility, and that the repeated test did not increase the immobility response. Moreover, sensorimotor tasks, neophobia in the corner test and emotional behaviour in the dark-light box correlated with FST immobility, contributing to the response. The results support the concern of geroscience on the relevance of using aged animals but also aware about taking into account the complexity of their comorbid scenario.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of aPRP in treating patients with at least grade 2 on the Kellgren and Lawrence system for the classification of knee OA using a proteomic approach and clinical evaluation tool of Lequesne index. Musculoskeletal ultrasound was used for accurate needle placement into the knee joint, and to the perimeniscal soft tissue for the injection of aPRP. Three monthly aPRP injections were performed. Group 1 patients received intra-articular (IA) injection only, while group 2 received simultaneous IA and pes anserinus aPRP injections. After two monthly aPRP injections, both groups revealed significant drops in average SF total protein concentrations, and increases in the protein concentrations associated with chelation and anti-aging (eg/transthyretin, matrilin, and complement). However, it is group 2 that revealed significant decreases in the protein concentrations associated with inflammation (eg/immunoglobulin and apolipoprotein), and improved knee functional status. SF appeared to become less susceptible to degeneration after aPRP injections in group 2. As a result, at least 2 monthly injection of IA aPRP in conjunction with accurate injection of aPRP to the perimeniscal soft tissue structure such as the pes anserinus may be a viable option in treating patients with moderate to severe degrees of knee OA.",

Other forms of dysregulated blood pressure (BP) behaviour, such as orthostatic hypotension have also been associated with cardiovascular (CV) events. The eye is potentially vulnerable to dysregulated systemic BP if ocular circulation autoregulation is impaired. We investigated whether phenotypes of abnormal BP stabilisation after orthostasis, an autonomic stressor, had a relationship with contrast sensitivity (CS), an outcome measure of subtle psychophysical visual function.This was a cross-sectional study from wave 1 of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). From beat-to-beat orthostatic BP (BP), measured by digital photoplethysmography during active stand, 4 phenotypes have been defined 1) normal stabilisation 2) orthostatic hypotension, 3) orthostatic hypertension 4) BP variability. Contrast sensitivity was measured using a Functional Visual Analyzer. Multivariable linear regression models investigated the relationship between orthostatic BP phenotypes and contrast sensitivity in 4289 adults aged \u226550\u202fyears adjusting for, demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, self-reported eye pathologies, objective hypertension and antihypertensives. A sensitivity analysis adjusted for age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy identified on retinal photographs. Finally models were compared, adjusting for alternative measures of cataract versus not, to examine the potential effect of cataract on any associations.Systolic orthostatic BP variability was associated with worse contrast sensitivity, in the primary and the sensitivity analysis. Adjusting for alternative measures of clinical cataract attenuated the association by 18%.Orthostatic BP variability is associated with worse contrast sensitivity, independent of hypertension and retinal pathology and may be a cardiovascular biomarker of early ocular pathology.",

Results showed that supplementation of BRAE extended the lifespan of fruit flies by 20% and retarded the loss of locomotor function. Comparison of mRNA transcriptome profile between fruit flies of 20\u202fdays and 50\u202fdays after the start of normal diet and normal diet supplemented with BRAE (5\u202fmg/mL) identified 6687 differentially expressed coding genes. A large number of these differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes) analysis. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that up regulation in the glutathione metabolism, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and down regulation in FoxO signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway were most likely affected by supplementation of BRAE. In addition, several genes, including Zw (Zwischenferment), GstD2, GstE1, Gpx, Gclm, Tsc1, 4E-BP, DopR and D2R, which were involved in the pathways mentioned above, could be regulated by the supplementation of BRAE. Together, the results implicated that the expression of most of the mRNAs in fruit fly were closely associated with BRAE diet, which could provide a resource of mRNAs related in the field of aging and aging-related disease.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Development of AD is closely related to alterations of proteostasis including the deposition of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. Molecular chaperones such as \u03b1B-crystallin (CryaB) can prevent aggregation of proteins and enable their correct refolding. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (MAPK) pathway regulates CryaB activity through phosphorylation of CryaB. Here, we examined CryaB and phospho-(p-)Ser59-CryaB protein amounts in the prefrontal cortex of the senescence-accelerated OXYS rats at different stages of the development of AD-like pathology and in Wistar rats (control). We compared this result with the changes in the expression of genes involved in the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the prefrontal cortex of both rat strains. Manifestation and progression of AD-like pathology in OXYS rats were accompanied by an increased level of detergent-insoluble p-Ser59-CryaB in the brain cortex, while the CryaB amount did not change. p-Ser59-CryaB was absent in the detergent-soluble protein fraction of the cortex in both rat strains. Immunostaining of brain slices revealed notable colocalization of p-Ser59-CryaB with A\u03b2 in 18-month-old OXYS rats. According to RNA sequencing data, the development of AD-like pathology in OXYS rats is accompanied in the cortex by up- and downregulation of genes involved in p38 MAPK signaling. In general, we demonstrated that the manifestation AD-like pathology in OXYS rats occurs against the background of activation of p38 MAPK\u2013dependent CryaB phosphorylation and alterations of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. The increased p-Ser59-CryaB amount and its colocalization with A\u03b2 can be considered a response to the accumulation of protein aggregates and may be an important part of an endogenous mechanism of AD development.",

We aimed to investigate the associations between leukocyte TLs (LTLs), chronological age, sex and comorbidities in CAD patients. Any covariations between LTL, GDF11, IGF1, SIRT-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines were further assessed.In 300 patients with stable CAD (age 36\u201381\u202fyears, 20% females), DNA and RNA were isolated from whole blood for PCR analysis and relative quantification of LTLs and gene-expression of GDF11, IGF1,SIRT1, IL-12, IL-18 and IFN\u01b4, respectively. Serum was prepared for the analyses of circulating IL-18, IL-12, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1.Patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) presented with 20% shorter LTLs vs. patients without (p\u202f=\u202f0.019) indicating LTLs to be of importance for CAD severity. The observation however, was only observed in men (p\u202f=\u202f0.009, n\u202f=\u202f115), in which the upper LTL quartile associated with 64% lower frequency of previous MI compared to quartile 1\u20133 (p\u202f=\u202f0.005, adjusted). LTLs were not differently distributed according to sex or comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes type 2 and metabolic syndrome. LTLs and GDF11 were inversely correlated to age (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.17; p\u202f=\u202f0.007 and r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.16; p\u202f=\u202f0.010, respectively), however, separated in gender, LTL only in women (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.37) and GDF11 only in men (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.19) (p\u202f=\u202f0.006, both). GDF11 and SIRT1 were strongly inter-correlated (r\u202f=\u202f0.56, p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001), suggesting common upstream regulators. LTLs were moderately correlated to GDF11 and SIRT1 in overweight women (BMI\u202f\u2265\u202f25\u202fkg/m2) (r\u202f=\u202f0.41; p\u202f=\u202f0.027 and 0.43; p\u202f=\u202f0.020, respectively), which may reflect common life-style influences on LTLs and these markers.In all women, we observed further that the highest LTL quartile associated with higher GDF11 and SIRT expression and lower circulating levels of IL-12, IL-18 and TNF\u03b1, as compared to quartile 1, which may indicate lifestyle influences on female LTLs. In men, the highest LTL quartile associated with lower IFN\u01b4 expression and lower circulating TNF\u03b1. Overall, the results indicate an association between chronic low-grade inflammation and LTLs.Shorter LTLs in CAD patients with previously suffered MI may indicate telomere attrition as part of its pathophysiology in men. The inverse association between LTLs and age exclusively in women underpins the previously reported decline in attrition rate in men with increasing age. As elevated GDF11 and SIRT1 along with attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines seem to positively affect LTL in women, we hypothesize a potential sex-dimorphism in LTL regulation, which may implicate sex- adjusted health-preventive therapies.",

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been increasingly recognized to regulate mitochondrial function. The present study aimed to investigate the role of Nrf2 in the development of frailty and sarcopenia during aging, and to demonstrate whether Nrf2 contributes to the maintenance of muscle mass and function by regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics during the aging process.Young (5\u20136\u202fmonths), middle-aged (11-13\u202fmonths), old (20\u201324\u202fmonths) Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 (knockout, KO) mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) C57/BL6 mice were used in this study. Physical function of the mice in the 6 groups was assessed by grip strength test, four paw inverted hanging test, rotarod analysis, open field analysis, and treadmill endurance test. Muscle mass was measured by cross-sectional area (CSA) of tibialis anterior muscles and gastrocnemius muscle weight. The frailty status of the 25 old WT mice and 23 old KO mice were assessed based on the mouse frailty phenotype assessment. Expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1), peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1\u03b1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM)) and mitochondrial dynamics (optic atrophy protein 1 (Opa1), mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)) were measured in the skeletal muscle. SDH staining was performed and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was measured. Transmission electron microscopy was used to measure the mitochondria number and morphology.Physical function and muscle mass decreased during aging. The mRNA expression levels of Nrf2 decreased with increasing frailty phenotype scores in the old WT mice. There were minimal differences in the physical function and muscle mass between the WT and KO mice in the young groups, whereas Nrf2 deficiency caused a declined physical function and muscle mass in the middle-aged and old mice, and exacerbated frailty in the old mice. The decreases of the physical function and muscle mass were accompanied by the reduced expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics, as well as a reduction of mitochondrial number, mitochondrial content, mtDNA copy number, and an impaired mitochondria morphology in the skeletal muscle.Nrf2 deficiency exacerbated frailty and sarcopenia during aging, at least partially by impairing skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in an age-dependent manner.",

     "abstract": "Aging causes a gradual decrease in maximal grip strength and leads many elderly people to have to rely on visual feedback to compensate for poorer muscle strength in performing daily activities and preventing accidents. Previous studies have investigated age and visual feedback-related changes in grip strength. However, little is known about methods of determining the quality and stability of hand grip strength control in the elderly, which is important for understanding their ability to generate grip force when handling objects with and without visual feedback in daily living. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of aging and visual feedback on the stability of hand grip control in both hands in elderly adults. Forty-four healthy elderly persons (age 80.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.53\u202fyears) and 36 young adults (age 32.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f16.48\u202fyears) were recruited to execute grip force stability tasks using both hands at a 2\u202fkg target force level. To perform the grip force stability task, the participants were asked to hold the dynamometer tightly in an attempt to achieve the target force level under visual and non-visual feedback conditions. Strength performances (grip force and coefficient of variation values) and stability of strength control (deviation error, variation error and force stability index values) for hand grip force stability tasks were calculated and analyzed. Compared with the visual feedback condition, the stability of grip force control in the hands of the young and elderly groups were significantly reduced in the non-visual feedback condition by 23.5%\u201357.1% (p\u202f<\u202f.05). The elderly group also showed significantly worse hand grip strength performances and stability of hand strength control than the young adult group (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Aging and non-visual feedback reduced the hand grip force output and stability of grip strength control of the hands. This may reveal the difficulty with manipulating hand-held objects in the absence of visual feedback while performing activities of daily living among the elderly.",

     "abstract": "Ageing is associated with cardiovascular disease and reduced cardiac function. This cardiac functional decline is accompanied by cardiac remodeling and alterations in cardiomyocyte composition. Recently, it was shown that the natural polyamine spermidine preserves cardiac function and cardiomyocyte composition in old mice. As cardiac function critically relies on blood supply, we tested whether spermidine has also beneficial effects on ageing-associated changes of the myocardial microcirculation.Using transmission electron microscopy, the left ventricular capillaries of young (4-months old) and aged (24-months old) C57BL/6J male mice were investigated by stereology. Aged mice were subdivided into an untreated group and a group that was fed spermidine late in life for 6\u202fmonths. Specifically, total volume, surface area and length of capillaries as well as endothelial thickness were estimated. Additionally, the total length of precapillary arterioles was assessed. The protein level of VEGF-A was measured using Western blot.Ageing was associated with whole heart and left ventricular hypertrophy. All total capillary-related values (including volume, surface area and length) were significantly higher in 24-month-old mice compared with 4-month-old mice. Moreover, VEGF-A expression was significantly enhanced in aged mice. The mean thickness of the endothelium was not different, but the mean area of myocardium supplied by capillaries was smaller in old mice. Spermidine treatment had no significant effect on the ageing-associated structural changes or VEGF-A expression.In conclusion, in the left ventricles of aged mice the growth of capillaries and arterioles supplying cardiomyocytes were in proportion to whole organ hypertrophy. Spermidine had no effect on quantitative characteristics of capillaries or arterioles, suggesting that the beneficial effects of spermidine on the ageing heart do not depend on the quantitative structural characteristics of the microcirculation which does not exclude potential functional differences between the groups.",

     "abstract": "Whether lifespan scales to age-associated changes in health and disease is an urgent question in societies with increasing lifespan. Body mass is associated with organismal functioning in many species, and often changes with age. We here tested in zebra finches whether two factors that decreased lifespan, sex and poor environmental quality, accelerated the onset of body mass declines. We subjected 597 birds for nine years to experimentally manipulated foraging costs (harsh\u202f=\u202fH, benign\u202f=\u202fB) during development (small vs large brood size) and in adulthood (easy vs hard foraging conditions) in a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 design. This yielded four treatment combinations (HH, HB, BH, BB) for each sex. Harsh environments during development and in adulthood decreased average body mass additively. The body mass aging trajectory showed a short steep increase in early adulthood, followed by a plateau and then a decline after 5\u202fyears. This decline occurred in all groups except for HB females, which gained mass until death. Surprisingly, the onset of body mass decline was earlier in experimental groups with a longer lifespan. In contrast, the onset of body mass decline was one year earlier in females, which lived two months (4%) shorter than males. Thus, the onset of body mass aging associated positively with the sex-specific differences in lifespan, but negatively with the environmental modulation of lifespan. Thus, body mass aging trajectories did not generally scale to lifespan, and we discuss the possible causes and implications of this finding.",

All rats were intragastrically treated with saline, trimetazidine, or l\u2011carnitine for 4\u202fweeks. Blood sample parameters (MDA, SOD, Glu, TG, TC, LDL-c, HDL-c, AST, ALT, ALP, BUN, Cr, LDH), Echocardiographic paramerters, ATP levels of cardiac apex, cardiac pathology (HE staining and mitochondrial ultrastructures), and cardiac metabolism-related parameters (glucose transporter type-4[GLUT-4], carnitine palmitoyl transferase\u20111[CPT-1]) were analyzed in each group.The left ventricular ejection fractions were normal in most groups, with a higher value observed in the AT group than in the AC group. The AC group showed decreased ATP levels of cardiac apex compared with the YC group. But both trimetazidine and l\u2011carnitine attenuated the aging-induced decrease in ATP levels of cardiac apex. The AC group also showed increased myocardial fiber fragmentations and dissolutions, and interstitial proliferation compared with the YC group. However both trimetazidine and l\u2011carnitine protected against the aging-induced pathological changes in myocardium. Furthermore, both trimetazidine and l\u2011carnitine prevented mitochondria of cardiomyocytes from aging-induced injury. Both the AT and AL groups had significantly fewer focal cavitations and higher mitochondrial matrix electron densities than the AC group. GLUT-4 and CPT-1 protein levels were significantly lower while GLUT-4/CPT-1 ratios were higher in aging rats than YC rats. The AT and AL groups had significantly higher GLUT-4 and CPT-1 levels than the AC group, with more significant changes observed in the AT group.Trimetazidine and l\u2011carnitine may partially improve the age-related changes of rat myocardial metabolisms and heart function via regulating cardiac metabolic substrates, with trimetazidine being superior. Interestingly, they may also reduce cardiac energy generation and impair mitochondrial structures in young rats. These findings suggest that age should be taken as an independent factor during the use of metabolic modulatory drugs in the patients with cardiovascular diseases because it may completely change the effects of drugs.",

Mice in the TU group were given testosterone undecanoate (39\u202fmg/kg) by subcutaneous injection on the back at fifteen-months-old, once a month, a total of three times. The old group received solvent reagent (corn oil) by the same method.The aging mice exhibited a decrease in serum testosterone, and Gas6 levels and an increase in apoptosis, and manifested cardiac fibrosis. Testosterone injection to wild type mice increased the levels of testosterone and Gas6 in serum and decreased cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis. Axl\u2212/\u2212mice receiving testosterone injection exhibited no obvious improvement in cardiac remodeling although the levels of testosterone and Gas6 in serum elevated.These data indicated that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) alleviates cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis, at least in part by enhancing Gas6 expression.

TRT would improve aging-related cardiac remolding via Gas6/Axl signaling pathway, implicating its therapeutic potential to treat aging-related heart disease.",

Here we use the copepod Tigriopus californicus to test for sex differences in stress resistance, proteolytic activity and longevity. Unlike many model organisms, this species does not have sex chromosomes. However, substantial sex differences were still observed. Females were found to have superior tolerance to a range of acute stressors (high temperature, high salinity, low salinity, copper and bisphenol A (BPA)) across a variety of treatments including different populations, pure vs. hybrid crosses, and different shading environments. Upregulation of proteolytic capacity \u2014 one molecular mechanism for responding to acute stress \u2014 was also found to be sexually dimorphic. In the combined stress treatment of chronic copper exposure followed by acute heat exposure, proteolytic capacity was suppressed for males. Females, however, maintained a robust proteolytic stress response. While females consistently showed greater tolerance to short-term stress, lifespan was largely equivalent between the two sexes under both benign conditions and mild thermal stress. Our findings indicate that short-term stress tolerance does not predict long-term survival under relatively mild conditions.",

However, little is known about SA-\u03b2-gal dynamics in aging gamete cells. To address this issue, here we investigated activity and intracellular localization of SA-\u03b2-gal in freshly obtained and aging oocytes and eggs of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. Data base mining revealed the presence of several homologous \u03b2-galactosidase sequences in the annotated Xenopus genome. Some of them were predicted to contain an N-terminal signal peptide sequence, suggesting enzyme translocation to cellular organelles. Biochemical and microscopic analyses confirmed SA-\u03b2-gal localization in the particulate and cytosolic fractions of oocytes and eggs. SA-\u03b2-gal activity was found to reside predominantly within a fraction of dense cytoplasmic granules that were extensively stained with the lysosome-specific dye LysoTracker Green DND-26 and had an average size of 8.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.6\u202f\u03bcm. These features identify the SA-\u03b2-gal-containing granules as a subpopulation of yolk platelets, specialized late endosomes or lysosomes that accumulate and store processed protein in frog oocytes. Further analysis revealed an increase of SA-\u03b2-gal activity in Xenopus eggs, but not in oocytes, aged in vitro over 48\u202fh. Our data suggest that endosomal acidification during egg aging may be responsible for this increase.",

     "abstract": "Young honey bee workers (0 to 2\u20133\u202fweeks old) perform tasks inside the colony, including brood care (nursing), whereas older workers undergo foraging tasks during the next 3\u20134\u202fweeks, when an intrinsic senescence program culminates in worker death. We hypothesized that foragers are less able to react to immune system stimulation than nurse bees and that this difference is due to an inefficient immune response in foragers. To test this hypothesis, we used an experimental design that allowed us to uncouple chronological age and behavior status (nursing/foraging). Worker bees from a normal age demography colony (where workers naturally transit from nursing to foraging tasks as they age) and of a single-cohort colony setup (composed of same-aged workers performing nursing or foraging tasks) were tested for survival and capability of activation of the immune system after bacterial injection. Expression of an antimicrobial peptide gene, defensin-1 (def-1), was used to assess immune system activation. We then checked whether the immune response includes changes in the expression of aging- and behavior-related genes, specifically vitellogenin (vg), juvenile hormone esterase (jhe), and insulin-like peptide-1 (ilp-1). We found a significant difference in survival rate between bees of different ages but carrying out the same tasks. Our results thus indicate that the bees' immune response is negatively affected by intrinsic senescence. Additionally, independent of age, foragers had a shorter lifespan than nurses after bacterial infection, although both were able to induce def-1 transcription. In the normal age demography colony, the immune system activation resulted in a reduction in the expression of vg, jhe and ilp-1 genes in foragers, but not in the nurse bees, demonstrating that age and behavior are both important influences on the bees' immune response. By disentangling the effects of age and behavior in the single-cohort colony, we found that vg, jhe and ilp-1 response to immune system stimulation was independent of behavior. Younger bees were able to mount a stronger immune response than older bees, thus highlighting age as an important factor for immunity. Taken together, our results provide new insights into how age and behavior affect the honey bee's immune response.",

Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER-stress) increases neuronal apoptosis after surgery, and chaperone molecules, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), help reduce unfolded protein reactions, thereby promoting protein homeostasis. Mammal sirtuin1 (SIRT1)-mediated deacetylation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) upregulates HSF1 binding to the HSP70 promoter. Caloric restriction (CR) improves cognition in many neurodegenerative models. In this study, we evaluated whether CR improves impaired learning and memory after surgery by attenuating ER-stress in an SIRT1-dependent manner. Male 18-month-old C57BL/6J mice receiving a 12-week CR or an ad libitum (AL) diet pre-intervention were challenged with tibial open fracture surgery and anesthesia or no treatment. We found a significant protective effect of CR on memory in contextual fear conditioning test after surgery compared with the AL group. CR alleviated ER-stress and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus induced by surgery. CR increased HSP70 expression through the HSF1/HSP pathway in a SIRT1-mediated manner, and inhibition of SIRT1 in the hippocampus by lentivirus injection partially reduced the benefits of CR (increased HSP70, deacetylated HSF1, reduced ER-stress, and improved memory). Taken together, our results showed that CR alleviates memory impairment postoperatively via attenuation of ER-stress in the hippocampus in an SIRT1-dependent manner, and the SIRT1/HSF1/HSP70 pathway is involved in this process.",

The population-doubling level (PDL) was calculated, PDL5 and PDL25 respectively referred to cells cultured for 2\u202fdays and 30\u202fdays. Compared with Ang II-treated young PDL5 cells, chronic stimulation of Ang II significantly promoted the senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity and expression of senescence-related genes p16 and p21, slowed down cell growth rate, and decreased expression of longevity-related genes sirtuin1 as well as telomerase activity in senescent PDL25 cells (all P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Moreover, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules were up-regulated in Ang II-treated PDL25 cells (all P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Ang II-induced senescent progression and inflammation were attenuated by angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan. In young PDL5 cells, Ang II promoted the endothelial viability including cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and cell adhesion to monocytes; however, chronic stimulation of Ang II suppressed the cell viability, promoted cell adhesion and apoptosis in senescent PDL25 cells, which could be ameliorated by short-term valsartan, but long-term valsartan had no effects. In addition, Ang II-induced senescent features could be partly recovered if Ang II was stopped at PDL20. These findings suggested that chronic stimulation of Ang II can accelerate the endothelial senescence process which is implicated in aging-related atherosclerosis.",

BMAL1+/+ livers showed diurnal fluctuations in factor (F)VII, FVII, protein S and anti-thrombin gene expression, which were not observed in BMAL1\u2212/\u2212 tissues. Interestingly, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) expression was significantly upregulated in all BMAL1\u2212/\u2212 versus BMAL1+/+ brains at both time points. Plasma t-PA-PAI-1 complex levels were however similar for all groups.Bmal1 deficiency affected the biphasic rhythm of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors predominantly in the liver. In the brain, Bmal1-dependent control of t-PA gene expression was documented for the first time.",

     "abstract": "Previously, we successfully established a d-galactose (d-gal)-induced astrocyte aging model in vitro. However, whether the changes in the aged astrocytes induced by d-gal are similar to those occurred in naturally are unknown. Therefore, in current study, we simultaneously established d-gal-induced and naturally aged astrocyte aging models in vitro to explore the age-related changes and to compare the differences in these two astrocyte aging models. The Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer was used to examine the mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis activities of the young and senescent astrocytes. The results showed that the mitochondrial ATP-linked oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were decreased markedly both in the d-gal-induced and naturally occurring senescent astrocytes. The basal glycolysis activity was increased in the naturally occurring senescent astrocytes, whereas it was decreased in the d-gal-induced senescent astrocytes. Western blot analysis showed that isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) were markedly decreased both in these two aging models, whereas the iron\u2011sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU) was up-regulated in the naturally occurring senescent astrocytes but was down-regulated in the d-gal-induced senescent astrocytes. The expression levels of glial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), glutamine synthetase (GS) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2 (GABABR2) were also markedly decreased in these two aging models. In addition, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was to be inactivated both in the d-gal-induced and naturally occurring senescent astrocytes. These results indicate that the age-related changes in d-gal-induced senescent astrocytes are not fully consistent with those in naturally occurring senescent astrocytes, and it may be not suitable to use d-gal-induced senescent astrocytes to replace the naturally occurring senescent astrocytes to explore the aging mechanisms under some circumstances.",

The purpose of the present work was to expand previous research in this area by investigating relationships between sway-related control parameters and musculoskeletal measures of muscle function and health. Eleven female older adults and eight female young adults completed blood draw, grip, leg extension, and balance tests. Serum levels of skeletal muscle-specific troponin T (sTnT), a biomarker for muscle health, were obtained from blood samples. Maximal grip force and leg extension torque were obtained from dynamometer tests. Center of pressure parameters were derived from force platform records obtained during eyes open and eyes closed balance tests. Sway control parameters were derived from an inverted pendulum model with PID-feedback control. Regression analyses were used to quantify the relationship between model parameters and grip strength, leg strength, and sTnT. Model integral gain (Ki) was observed to significantly predict grip strength in the eyes open condition. In the eyes closed condition, model derivative gain (Kd) was observed to significantly predict sTnT, and both proportional (Kp) and noise (Kn) model gains were observed to significantly predict grip and leg strength measures. Collectively, the relationship between control (Ki, Kd, Kp) and musculoskeletal health (strength, sTnT) parameters suggests a compensation mechanism, which may have served to minimize effects of reduced muscle function on sway amplitude, overshoot, and accuracy. Most associations were observed during eyes closed conditions, suggesting that visual input plays a larger role in regulating balance than the proposed compensation mechanisms. This work highlights the potential use for both strength and sTnT tests as biomarkers for postural control and balance impairment in older adults.",

We recently reported that metabolic remodeling of white adipose tissue (WAT) plays an important role in the beneficial actions of CR; however, the detailed molecular mechanisms of this remodeling remain to be established. In the present study, we aimed to identify CR-induced alterations in the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism, and of its downstream signaling mediators in liver and WAT, across the lifespan of rats. We evaluated groups of rats that had been either fed ad libitum or calorie restricted from 3\u202fmonths of age and were euthanized at 3.5, 9, or 24\u202fmonths of age, under fed and fasted conditions. The expression of FGF21 mRNA and/or protein increased with age in liver and WAT. Interestingly, in the WAT of 9-month-old fed rats, CR further upregulated FGF21 expression and eliminated the aging-associated reductions in the expression of FGFR1 and beta-klotho (KLB; FGF21 receptor complex). It also enhanced the expression of FGF21 targets, including glucose transporter 1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1. The analysis of transcriptional regulators of Fgf21 suggested that aging and CR might upregulate Fgf21 expression via different mechanisms. In adipocytes in vitro, constitutive FGF21 overexpression upregulated the FGF21 receptor complex and FGF21 targets at the mRNA or protein level. Thus, both aging and CR induced FGF21 expression in rat WAT; however, only CR activated FGF21 signaling. Our results suggest that FGF21 signaling contributes to the CR-induced metabolic remodeling of WAT, likely activating glucose uptake and mitochondrial biogenesis.",

The present study aimed to evaluate how and to what extent executive (dys)functions of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) may be related to PA. To this end, twenty-three subjects complaining of different cognitive deficits (from mild cognitive impairment likely due to Alzheimer's disease to mild AD) were recruited. PA was investigated by a well-known experimental venipuncture pain paradigm (open versus hidden [O-H] application of lidocaine). Patients also underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) GO/No-GO task for eliciting selective activation of the MPFC. Selected neuropsychological variables were correlated to the OH-PA paradigm. The association between the fMRI response on the \u201cNo-GO\u201d versus \u201cGO\u201d contrast and PA was investigated over the whole-brain by regression analysis. We showed the existence of a relationship between a lower PA and MPFC dysfunctions through the neuropsychological and fMRI assessment. A separate voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis controlled for possible influence of grey matter (GM) volume reduction on both fMRI results and PA. fMRI results were not directly affected by, and therefore independent of, disease-specific GM atrophy, which was indeed located more anteriorly within the rostral anterior cingulate and inversely correlated with PA. Our findings shed new light on the underestimated contribution of executive (dys)functions mediated by the MPFC (response-inhibition, self-monitoring and set-shifting abilities) in PA pathogenesis, with a special purely (i.e. independently from brain structural alterations) functional role played by the MCC. Results are discussed in terms of possible clinical relevance in the management of patients with neurocognitive disorders.",

     "abstract": "Aging rodent models allow for the discovery of underlying mechanisms of cranial muscle dysfunction. Methods are needed to allow quantification of complex, multivariate biomechanical movements during swallowing. Videofluoroscopic swallow studies (VSS) are the standard of care in assessment of swallowing disorders in patients and validated quantitative, kinematic, and morphometric analysis methods have been developed. Our purpose was to adapt validated morphometric techniques to the rodent to computationally analyze swallowing dysfunction in the aging rodent.VSS, quantitative analyses (bolus area, bolus velocity, mastication rate) and a rodent specific multivariate, morphometric computational analysis of swallowing biomechanics were performed on 20 swallows from 5 young adult and 5 old Fischer 344/Brown Norway rats. Eight anatomical landmarks were used to track the relative change in position of skeletal levers (cranial base, vertebral column, mandible) and soft tissue landmarks (upper esophageal sphincter, base of tongue).Bolus area significantly increased and mastication rate significantly decreased with age. Aging accounted for 77.1% of the variance in swallow biomechanics, and 18.7% of the variance was associated with swallow phase (oral vs pharyngeal). Post hoc analyses identified age-related alterations in tongue base retraction, mastication, and head posture during the swallow.Geometric morphometric analysis of rodent swallows suggests that swallow biomechanics are altered with age. When used in combination with biological assays of age-related adaptations in neuromuscular systems, this multivariate analysis may increase our understanding of underlying musculoskeletal dysfunction that contributes to swallowing disorders with aging.",

     "abstract": "Valvular heart disease is an increasing population health problem and, especially in the elderly, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The current treatment options, such as mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valve replacements, have significant restrictions and limitations. Considering the increased life expectancy of our aging population, there is an urgent need for novel heart valve concepts that remain functional throughout life to prevent the need for reoperation.Heart valve tissue engineering aims to overcome these constraints by creating regenerative, self-repairing valve substitutes with life-long durability. In this review, we give an overview of advances in the development of tissue engineered heart valves, and describe the steps required to design and validate a novel valve prosthesis before reaching first-in-men clinical trials. In-silico and in-vitro models are proposed as tools for the assessment of valve design, functionality and compatibility, while in-vivo preclinical models are required to confirm the remodeling and growth potential of the tissue engineered heart valves. An overview of the tissue engineered heart valve studies that have reached clinical translation is also presented. Final remarks highlight the possibilities as well as the obstacles to overcome in translating heart valve prostheses into clinical application.",

In order to identify an age-related gene expression pattern, we analyzed left ventricular myocardium of adult (6\u202fmonths) and old (24\u202fmonths) mice by use of whole genome expression arrays. About 2.3% of genes expressed above the median value of all genes were differentially expressed in old hearts. Nearly all of them were upregulated. After application of defined exclusion criteria, 98 genes were selected for a more detailed analysis. About one third of the 98 genes codes for factors involved in the immune reaction, such as chemokines (CCLs 6, 8, 9), proteins of the S100 family (S100s 4, 8, 9, 10, 11), complement components (C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, C3, C4b), bacteria/virus-induced genes (lysozyme 1/2, interferon-activated genes), and pro-inflammatory caspases (Casp1, Casp4, Casp12). Predominantly, genes coding for factors of the immune reaction were simultaneously upregulated in the kidneys and lungs of old mice, thereby emphasizing the pivotal role of immune cells in tissue aging. In conclusion, myocardial aging is mainly associated with an altered expression pattern of molecules involved in the immune reaction.",

     "abstract": "Ascorbic acid better known as vitamin C, is a reducing carbohydrate needed for a variety of functions in the human body. The most important characteristic of ascorbic acid is the ability to donate two electrons, predestining it as a major player in balancing the physiological redox state and as a necessary cofactor in multiple enzymatic hydroxylation processes. Ascorbic acid can be reversibly oxidized in two steps, leading to semidehydroascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid, respectively. Further degradation is irreversible and generates highly reactive carbonyl-intermediates. These intermediates are able to induce glycation of proteins, a non-enzymatic and unspecific reaction of carbonyls with amino groups involved to several age-related diseases.In this study, we investigated the effect of ascorbic acid- and dehydroascorbic acid-induced glycation on PC12 cells, which represent a model for neuronal plasticity. We found that both applications of ascorbic acid or dehydroascorbic acid leads to glycation of cellular proteins, but that ascorbic acid interferes more with viability and neurite outgrowth compared with dehydroascorbic acid.",

Telomeres in leukocytes are shorter in individuals with CAD than in healthy individuals of the same age. Levels of sex hormones are related to aging, and the ratio of testosterone to estradiol has been linked to CAD in men. Here we compared younger men (22\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202fyr, n\u202f=\u202f26), middle-aged men (31\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u202fyr, n\u202f=\u202f35), older men without CAD (60\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fyr, n\u202f=\u202f30) and older men with CAD (63\u202f\u00b1\u202f8\u202fyr, n\u202f=\u202f30) in terms of testosterone/estradiol ratio, leukocyte telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression, activity of telomerase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and length of PBMC telomeres. Levels of hTERT mRNA of leukocyte and PBMC telomerase activity were significantly lower in older men than in younger or middle-aged men (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). These two parameters, as well as testosterone/estradiol ratio, were significantly lower in older men with CAD than in all the other groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The sex hormone ratio correlated significantly with age, hTERT mRNA levels, PBMC telomerase activity and telomere length (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).

However, how aging specifically impacts slow and fast twitch fiber types remains elusive. Muscle proteostasis is largely maintained by the proteasomal system. Here we characterized the proteasomal system in two different fiber types, using a non-sarcopenic aging model. By analyzing the proteasomal activity and amount, as well as the polyubiquitinated proteins and the level of protein oxidation in Musculus soleus (Sol) and Musculus extensor digitorum longus (EDL), we found that the slow twitch Sol muscle shows an overall higher respiratory and proteasomal activity in young and old animals. However, especially during aging the fast twitch EDL muscle reduces protein oxidation by an increase of antioxidant capacity. Thus, under adaptive non-sarcopenic conditions, the two fibers types seem to have different strategies to avoid age-related changes.",

Physical activity may be especially important after age 60 when cognitive decline is more pronounced.

Two groups were formed according to their age (60\u201369 and 70\u201379\u202fyears-old) including sportsmen (n\u202f=\u202f23) and sedentary men (n\u202f=\u202f24). Spatial memory and efficiency of attentional networks were measured, as well as general intelligence. Results showed that sportsmen outperformed sedentary participants in many of the tests employed. Thus their alerting, orienting and executive networks worked more effectively in the ANT-I task for executive functions, and they were more accurate in the spatial memory task, displaying a better spatial orientation. Scores in other neuropsychological tasks followed the same tendency. These data support the protective effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive functions.",

We also underline the lack of studies, and thus a poor knowledge, on the effects of different single chemically defined AGEs administration, concurrent intake of different dietary AGEs, of load with dietary AGEs corresponding to the habitual diet in humans, and on those of dietary AGEs in vulnerable populations, such as infants and particularly elderly.",

The onset of abnormal estrous cycles and survival curves were compared between nulliparous and parous rats in each line. In the HAA line, pregnancy experience did not change the onset of ovarian senescence but increased longevity. This suggests that a pituitary tumor, which is a causal factor for accelerated mortality in this line, developed slowly in parous rats. In the LAA line, pregnancy experience delayed the onset of ovarian senescence and reduced the incidence of mammary tumors but did not increase longevity because of an increased frequency of constipation with megacolon.

Our results showed that G. lucidum effectively promoted the nematodes to resist the oxidative stress of paraquat and heavy metal Cr6+, and significantly prolonged the lifespan of the nematodes. The underlining mechanisms were further investigated by focusing on the signaling pathways that regulate the stress responses and the lifespan. We found that G. lucidum protected the nematode against the insults of paraquat and heavy metals through the diet restriction pathway and the mTOR/S6K signaling pathway, respectively. Whereas, the effect of G. lucidum on the longevity of the nematode mainly depended on the germline signaling pathway. Microarray assays were conducted to reveal the gene expression profiles. The expression levels of 2746 genes were significantly changed during the aging process, of which 34 genes were reversed in their expression by the treatment of G. lucidum in aged nematodes.

Non-cytotoxic doses of carbon nanoparticles but not of bigger carbon particles led to an irreversible reduction of the proliferative capacity accompanied by the accumulation of the cell cycle blocking proteins p21 and p16 as well as a loss of both redox sensitive histone deacetylase SIRT1 and connexin-43. Gap junction intercellular communication detected by microinjection of fluorescent lucifer yellow was dramatically decreased after exposure. This loss of functionality was associated with a reduction of Connexin 43 at the plasma membrane.

Participants (n\u202f=\u202f38) were long-term ER runners (n\u202f=\u202f10; 51.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.2\u202fyrs.; 28.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.4\u202fyrs. of experience) and untrained age-matched (n\u202f=\u202f17; 46.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.1\u202fyrs) and young controls (n\u202f=\u202f11; 21.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.0\u202fyrs). Volunteers were assessed for anamnesis, anthropometrics, and blood sampling. Measurements of pro-and anti-oxidant status and DNA extraction were performed using commercial kits. Relative LTL was determined with qPCR analyses (T/S). While the middle-aged controls had shorter LTL than the young group, no difference was observed between ER athletes and young participants. A large effect size between the LTL of ER athletes and middle-aged controls (d\u202f=\u202f0.85) was also observed. The ER athletes and untrained young group had better redox balance according to antioxidant/pro-oxidant ratios compared to middle-aged untrained participants, which also had lower values for redox parameters (TEAC/TBARS, SOD/TBARS, and CAT/TBARS; all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Furthermore, the NO level of ER athletes (175.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f31.9\u202f\u03bcM) was higher (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) than middle-aged controls (67.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f23.3\u202f\u03bcM) and young participants (129.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f17.3\u202f\u03bcM), with a significant correlation with LTL (r\u202f=\u202f0.766; p\u202f=\u202f0.02). In conclusion, ER runners have longer LTL than age-matched controls, which in turn may be related to better NO bioavailability and redox balance status.",

     "abstract": "Aging is a normal, progressive and multi-step degeneration in the physiological functions and metabolic processes of living organisms until death. It represents the main risk factor for many diseases (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases) and contributes to increase in mortality. Aging results, at least partially, from an accumulation of cell and tissue damage related to inherited and environmental factors, leading to biological and biochemical dysregulations. Arginase is a ubiquitous L-arginine-metabolizing enzyme involved in some fundamental mechanisms such as the urea cycle or polyamines synthesis. There is a growing awareness that arginase activity and/or expression are disturbed in a tissue-dependent manner during aging. However, whether these effects on arginase pathway are a primary cause or merely a consequence of aging is still an open question. In this review dealing with the interplay between the arginase pathway and aging, we will explore the involvement of arginase in aging mechanisms and, reversely, the impact of aging on the arginase pathway in various tissues and cells. Finally, the potential interest of arginase inhibition in aging and age-related diseases will also be analyzed.",

     "abstract": "Age-related declines in function can limit older adults' independence with activities of daily living (ADLs). While task-specific training maybe a viable approach to improve function, limited clinical resources prevent extensive training on wide ranges of skills and contexts. Thus, training on one task for the benefit of another (i.e., transfer) is important in geriatric physical rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to test whether motor transfer would occur between two functionally different upper extremity tasks that simulate ADLs in a sample of older adults following task-specific training.Ninety community dwelling adults ages 43 to 94\u202fyears old performed two trials of a functional dexterity and functional reaching task at baseline, and were then assigned to one of two groups. The training group completed 3\u202fdays of task-specific training (150 trials) on the functional reaching task, whereas the no-training group received no training on either task. Both groups were re-tested on both tasks at the end of Day 3.No significant interactions were observed between group (training vs. no-training) and time (baseline vs. re-test) on the functional dexterity task (i.e. transfer task), indicating no difference in the average amount of change from baseline to re-test between the groups. However, post hoc bivariate linear regression revealed an effect of age on motor transfer within the training group. For those who trained on the functional reaching task, the amount of transfer to the dexterity task was inversely related to age. There was no significant relationship between age and motor transfer for the no-training group.Results of our a priori group analysis suggest that functional reaching training did not, on average, transfer to the dexterity task. However, post hoc regression analysis showed that motor transfer was both experience- and age-dependent, such that motor transfer may decline with advanced age. Future research will consider how functional and cognitive aging influences transfer of motor skills across different activities of daily living.",

Additionally, the structure of TS alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is highly homologous to that found in humans. Previous studies have concluded that misfolded, fibrillar \u03b1-syn is a hallmark of \u03b1-synucleinopathies. In this study, we examined the distribution and expression levels of \u03b1-syn in different TS brain regions. We also obtained recombinant TS \u03b1-syn protein to study its aggregation and cytotoxic properties in primary neurons. Our results showed that \u03b1-syn was expressed in numerous different brain regions in TS but was most abundant in the hippocampus and midbrain. The recombinant \u03b1-syn of TS displayed straight fibrils when incubated for 72\u202fh in vitro, which is very similar to human \u03b1-syn. When exposed to primary neurons, the TS and human \u03b1-syn fibrils led to cytotoxicity and Lewy-like pathology.

Aerobic exercise is prescribed to improve aerobic fitness; however, middle-aged/older diabetic patients often suffer from mobility limitations which restrict walking. Non-weight-bearing/low-impact exercise is recommended but the optimal exercise prescription is uncertain. The goal of this randomized controlled trial was twofold: 1) to test if high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), implemented on a non-weight-bearing all-extremity ergometer, are feasible, well-tolerated and safe in middle-aged/older adults with type 2 diabetes; and 2) to test whether all-extremity HIIT is more effective in improving aerobic fitness than MICT. A total of 58 sedentary individuals with type 2 diabetes (46 to 78\u202fyears; 63\u202f\u00b1\u202f1) were randomized to all-extremity HIIT (n\u202f=\u202f23), MICT (n\u202f=\u202f19) or non-exercise control (CONT; n\u202f=\u202f16). All-extremity HIIT and MICT, performed 4\u00d7/week for 8\u202fweeks under supervision, resulted in no adverse events requiring hospitalization or medical treatment. Aerobic fitness (VO2peak) improved by 10% in HIIT and 8% in MICT and maximal exercise tolerance increased by 1.8 and 1.3\u202fmin, respectively (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.002 vs. baseline; P\u202f\u2265\u202f0.9 for HIIT vs. MICT). In conclusion, all-extremity HIIT and MICT are feasible, well-tolerated and safe and result in similar improvements in aerobic fitness in middle-aged/older individuals with type 2 diabetes. These findings have important implications for exercise prescription for diabetic patients; they indicate that all-extremity exercise is a feasible alternative to weight-bearing exercise and those who are unable or unwilling to engage in HIIT may receive similar benefits from MICT.",

Remarkably, the activities of ALDH1, ALDH2, ALDH3, GSTA4-4, AR and GSH-Px were significantly lower, and FDPL levels higher, in the arterial tissue of the aged subjects than in that of the young adult controls. Moreover, the enzymatic activities were inversely and significantly correlated with the levels of FDPL in the arterial tissue of both the aged and young subjects, highlighting their vascular antioxidant/antilipoperoxidative role in vivo.

Unfortunately, this suite occurs in humans as we age. In the current study, we used high-resolution monitors to track how circadian patterns of locomotor activity change in female Drosophila ananassae as they enter mid-to-late life. This equipment is a more recent addition to the fly circadian field and has not been previously used for long-term activity tracking. At 2\u20133\u202fdays post-eclosion, D. ananassae were placed into climate-controlled vivariums for 60\u202fdays. Daily actograms were generated for each animal, along with a time series of activity across the observational period. Consistent with findings from older rodents and humans, older D. ananassae exhibited degraded patterns of wake and sleep that were fragmented\u2014but still rhythmic\u2014across the 24-h cycle. Overall levels of daily activity declined with age, with particular loss of circadian arousal in the wake-maintenance zone a few hours before bedtime. Interestingly, our high-resolution monitoring strategy was also able to document a sleep correlation previously associated with human aging in flies: displacement of sleep timing arising from possible changes in circadian and homeostatic regulation. Future experiments may determine whether the age-related impairments seen in the sleep-circadian system of D. ananassae can be mitigated through precision light treatment.",

Different mechanisms and pathways are involved in detecting the intracellular and extracellular levels of macronutrients including amino acids. Detection of amino acids in food sources is provided by taste cells expressing T1R1 and T1R3 type receptors. Additionally, cells of the intestine, pancreas or heart sense amino acids extracellularly. Neuronal and hormonal regulation integrates and coordinates the signals at the organismal level. Amino acid-sensitive mechanisms including GCN2 protein, mTOR and LYNUS machinery adjust cellular process according to the availability of specific amino acids. Triggering these mechanisms by genetic manipulations or by external manipulations with diets has a significant impact on lifespan. In model organisms, the restriction of protein or specific amino acids within the diet leads to lifespan-extending effects. However, the translation of results from model organisms to application in humans has to take into account lifestyle, psychology, social aspects and the possibility to choose what to eat and how it is cooked.",

     "abstract": "Swallowing is a complex movement consisting of the sequential and orderly activation of the swallowing muscles. Neuroimaging evidence has revealed a complex cortical and subcortical representation of voluntary swallowing. The repetitive saliva swallowing test (RSST) is a convenient and simple method for assessing swallowing performance in older people. It remains unclear whether individual differences in swallowing performance are associated with variations in structural brain signatures. We aimed to investigate the association between swallowing efficiency (SWE, measured by the RSST) and gray matter volume (GMV) in healthy older adults. Forty healthy older adults (52\u201382\u202fyears old, 28 female) underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical assessments of SWE, stimulated/unstimulated salivary flow rate, masticatory cycle, and walking speed. GMV was quantified using a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach based on the MRI data. SWE was significantly negatively correlated with age. The association between SWE and hand grip strength, but not the other clinical metrics, was statistically significant. The GMV of the left posterior cerebellum (from cerebellum crus to lobule VIII) was significantly positively correlated with SWE, as evidenced by the results of whole-brain and cerebellum-specific VBM analyses. SWE was significantly positively correlated with the cerebellar volume in the region-of-interest analyses based on automated segmentation. In healthy older adults, swallowing efficiency was positively correlated with cerebellar GMV. The findings suggested that in older people, structural variations of the brain may play a key role in individual differences in swallowing performance.",

     "abstract": "Reloading of atrophied muscles after hindlimb suspension (HLS) can induce muscle injury and prolong recovery after disuse in old rats, especially in fast contracting muscles. Less is known about the responses in mice and whether fast and slow muscles from geriatric mice will respond in a similar fashion to HLS unloading and recovery (HLS\u202f+\u202fR). Furthermore, while slow muscles undergo atrophy with disuse, they typically are more resistant to sarcopenia than fast contracting muscles. Geriatric (28\u202fmo. of age) male C57BL/6 mice were randomly placed into 3 groups. These included HLS for 14\u202fdays n\u202f=\u202f9, and HLS followed by 14\u202fdays of reloading recovery (HLS\u202f+\u202fR; n\u202f=\u202f9), or normal ambulatory cage controls (n\u202f=\u202f9). Control mice were not exposed to unloading. Electrically evoked maximal muscle function was assessed in vivo in anesthetized mice at baseline, after 14\u202fdays of HLS or HLS\u202f+\u202fR. As expected, HLS significantly reduced body weight, wet weight of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and in vivo maximal force. There were no differences in vivo fatigability of the plantar flexor muscles and overall fiber size. There were only minor fiber type distribution and frequency distribution of fiber sizes that differ between HLS\u202f+\u202fR and control gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Soleus muscle wet weight had recovered to control levels after reloading, but type I/IIA fibers in the soleus muscles were significantly smaller after HLS\u202f+\u202fR than control muscles. In contrast, gastrocnemius muscle wet weight did not recover to control levels after reloading. Plantar flexion muscle force (primarily influenced by the gastrocnemius muscles) did not recover in HLS\u202f+\u202fR conditions as compared to HLS conditions and both were lower than control force production signaling for apoptosis, autophagy and anabolic markers were not different between control and HLS\u202f+\u202fR gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in geriatric mice. These results suggest that molecular signaling does not explain attenuated ability to regain muscle wet weight, fiber size or muscle force production after HLS in geriatric mice. It is possible that fluid shifts, reduced blood flow, or shortened muscle fibers which failed to regain control lengths contributed to the attenuation of muscle wet weight after HLS and reloading and this affected force production. Further work is needed to determine if altered/loss of neural activity contributed to the inability of geriatric mice to regain gastrocnemius muscle weight and function after HLS and reloading.",

     "abstract": "Neurogenesis is the key mechanism of neuronal plasticity in the adult mammalian brain. Alterations of neurogenesis happen concurrently with (and contribute to) development and progression of numerous neuropathological conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Being the most common type of dementia, AD is studied extensively; however, the data concerning changes in neurogenesis in the pathogenesis of this disease are inconsistent. Here, using OXYS rats as a suitable model of the most common (sporadic) form of AD, we examined neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in early ontogenesis prior to appearance of any signs of neurodegeneration and during development and progression of AD-like pathology. We demonstrated retardation of hippocampal development in OXYS rats at an early age; this problem may contribute to the emergence of AD signs late in life. Manifestation and progression of AD-like pathology are accompanied by transcriptome changes affecting genes involved in neurogenesis in the hippocampus. These genes are associated with the extracellular matrix and angiogenesis; this observation points to alteration of a cellular microenvironment. This change along with an increased TrkA/p75NTR ratio of nerve growth factor receptors in the hippocampus may contribute to increased density of immature neurons that we observed at the progressive stage of AD-like pathology in OXYS rats. These changes may be considered a compensatory reaction intended to slow down AD-associated neurodegeneration at the progressive stage of the disease. Collectively, these data suggest that alterations of neurogenesis may not only accompany the course of Alzheimer's disease but also play a causative role in this disorder.",

We systematically identified predominantly preformed, long, noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as integrative biomarkers of CD8+ T cell aging in 14 elderly CMV carriers over 80\u202fyears of age. After sorting the CD28nullCD8+ T cell subset and its CD28bearingCD8+ counterpart in five nonagenarians, we profiled the differential expression of lncRNAs and genes in CD28nullCD8+ T cells via array detection. We focused on 11 differentially expressed antisense lncRNAs and cross-referenced them with previously identified age-accumulated lncRNAs to create a set of candidates in CD28nullCD8+T cells. We performed intracellular validation on the age-accumulated candidate lncRNAs paired with their antisense target genes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Simultaneously, we sorted the CMVpp65-specific CD8+ T cell subset and its counterpart from participant cells with the HLA-A-*0201 genotype. The validated age-accumulated lncRNAs in CD28nullCD8+ T cells were intracellularly cross-validated in CMVpp65CD8+ T cells. Finally, we identified the immunity-related gene(s) that acted as potential target(s) to the cross-validated age-accumulated lncRNA(s), using bioinformatics techniques. The potential regulation of the final identified lncRNA-gene pair(s) was simultaneously predicted in two pathway-integrated networks. We concluded that expression of an age-accumulated lncRNA (NRON) was decreased, whereas that of its immunity-related target gene (NFAT) was increased, in both CD28nullCD8+ T cells and CMVpp65CD8+ T cells of elderly individuals with persistent CMV infection. The identification of NRON as a potential biomarker suggests that NRON contributes to CMV-enhanced CD28nullCD8+ T cell aging by modulating phosphorylation and/or IL-4-dependent NFAT signaling.",

Hippocampal volume was quantified from a three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI. CoV of stride time was recorded at self-selected pace with an electronic walkway. Age, sex, body mass index, number of drugs daily taken, history of falls, walking speed, type of MRI scanner, total intracranial volume, and white matter volume abnormality were used as covariates.Participants with moderate to severe SCI had a higher CoV of stride time compared to those with mild SCI and na-MCI (P\u202f<\u202f0.010), and a higher hippocampal volume compared to other groups (P\u202f\u2264\u202f0.001).

Recently, it has also been applied to Parkinson's disease (PD) with promising results, but mostly just focusing on separate proxy measures of CR, such as education, working and leisure time activities, instead of adopting a more comprehensive approach.Using the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq), this study examined the association of CR with motor functions and cognition in patients with medium-low (1\u20139\u202fyears) and medium-high (>9\u202fyears) PD duration.Fifty patients with PD underwent a neurological and a neuropsychological assessment, comprised of: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale- section III, Mini-Mental State Examination, Clock-Drawing Test, Rey auditory verbal learning test (immediate and delayed recall trials), Digit Span Forward, Corsi Span Forward, Frontal Assessment Battery, Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices, WAIS similarities subtest, Phonemic Fluency, Semantic Fluency and CRIq.PD patients with a higher CRIq score showed a reduced motor impairment and a better global cognitive performance when compared to PD patients with a lower CRIq score, with an advantage especially observed on executive functions and short-term memory. The CR effect was even enhanced in the case of longer disease duration, as observed when considering the overall neuropsychological tests performance and non-verbal abstract reasoning in particular. The results obtained when considering education, as a single proxy measure of CR, provided no additional findings, nor did they reveal all the effects yielded by the adoption of the CRI score.Our results support the beneficial role of CR against motor and cognitive dysfunctions in PD and suggest that its protective role may be mostly manifested at the later stages of the disease. A theoretical framework able to explain the different impact of CR on Alzheimer Disease and PD is discussed. Finally, our results stressed the importance of using a comprehensive measure of CR instead of focusing on just one of its proxies.",

     "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) facilitates cognitive enhancement by directly increasing neuroplasticity, and has shown promising results as an external intervention to attenuate age-related cognitive decline. However, stimulation protocols have failed to account for age-associated changes in brain structure and the present literature omits investigation of attentional control, despite the occurrence of substantial inhibitory processing deficits with age. To provide new insight into the benefits of tDCS, the objective of this study was to develop an age-optimised stimulation protocol in which key parameters (amplitude, duration, and electrode configuration) were selected in accordance with knowledge of stimulation effects, specific to the ageing brain. Participants (mean age 66.5\u202fyears) completed three sessions of double-blind, anodal or sham stimulation, in conjunction with a novel task switching paradigm, which was designed to reflect the complexities of simultaneously monitoring and updating stimulus representations. The results show that those who had anodal tDCS exhibited an acute, post-stimulation increase in task switching speed (p\u202f<\u202f.01, d\u202f=\u202f1.36). Although the sham group was subject to the same task exposure, only the anodal stimulation group experienced a performance gain, thus emphasising the efficacy of active brain stimulation. For the first time, this study demonstrates the utility of stimulation protocols tailored specifically for use with older adults, targeted towards the modulation of attentional control. This finding has critical implications for cognitive health and encourages the use of age-optimised tDCS as a viable method for enhancing executive function in later life.",

Immunosenescence is also a devastating consequence of oxidative stress, but there is a lack of research on effective ways to overcome it. In this study, we used physiologic and immunological aging mouse models that had sustained oxidative stress to investigate whether voluntary exercise and/or antioxidant treatment could overcome oxidative damage as well as aging. We established an aging model induced by continuously administering d-galactose (d-gal) to 6-week-old female C57BL/6J mice. We also assessed reversal of immunosenescence by providing free-wheel running and vitamin E (vit E) supplementation to this aging model. As an aging index, the level of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the blood was measured. Phenotypes of T cells in the thymus and spleen were examined as an index of immunosenescence. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the mouse spleen and levels of AGEs in the blood were significantly higher after 6\u202fweeks of d-gal administration. In addition, immunosenescence was observed, in which the na\u00efve:effector cell ratio in the spleen decreased. After 4\u202fweeks of free-wheel running and vit E administration, both intracellular ROS and serum AGE levels decreased. Above all, free-wheel running restored the na\u00efve:effector ratio of cytotoxic T lymphocytes reduced by d-gal administration. Taken together, these results suggest that voluntary exercise may be effective in restoring immunosenescence induced by oxidative stress.",

Physical activity is also reduced in rodents after ovariectomy (OVX) and whole-body estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) knockout. However, it is unclear if the effects are estradiol (E2) specific. Thus, the overall purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the ovarian hormones, E2 and progesterone (P4), and skeletal muscle ER\u03b1 (skmER\u03b1) on physical activity and skeletal muscle contractility in female mice.Study 1: Forty female C57Bl/6J mice were given free access to running wheels for 2\u202fweeks to assess baseline running and randomized into 4 treatment groups: OVX, OVX\u202f+\u202fE2, OVX\u202f+\u202fP4, OVX\u202f+\u202fE2\u202f+\u202fP4. All mice underwent OVX, returned to wheels for 2\u202fweeks, received hormone pellet implants and returned to running wheels for 6\u202fweeks, after which soleus muscle contractility testing was completed. Study 2: Thirty-two skeletal muscle specific ER\u03b1 knock-out (skmER\u03b1KO) mice and wildtype (WT) littermates were randomized into 4 groups: skmER\u03b1KO-Run, skmER\u03b1WT-Run, skmER\u03b1KO-Sed, and skmER\u03b1WT-Sed. Run mice were given free access to wheels for 20\u202fwk and sedentary (Sed) mice maintained normal cage activities. At the end point, muscle contractility was tested.Study 1: OVX\u202f+\u202fE2\u202f+\u202fP4 group ran greater distances than both the OVX and OVX\u202f+\u202fP4 groups (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.009). After fatiguing contractions, soleus muscles of the OVX\u202f+\u202fE2\u202f+\u202fP4 group maintained greater submaximal force than those of other groups (p\u202f=\u202f0.023). Immediately after the fatiguing contractions, OVX\u202f+\u202fE2\u202f+\u202fP4 muscles had greater maximal force production than the OVX\u202f+\u202fE2 group (p\u202f=\u202f0.027). Study 2: There were no differences in running distance between skmER\u03b1WT and skmER\u03b1KO mice (p\u202f=\u202f0.240). Soleus muscles of skmER\u03b1KO mice were more fatigable (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and did not recover force as well as skmER\u03b1WT mice (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). In vivo isometric, concentric and eccentric torque was decreased in skmER\u03b1KO mice compared to skmER\u03b1WT mice (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.029).Combined treatment of E2\u202f+\u202fP4 in OVX mice restored physical activity, predominantly driven by E2, and protected soleus muscles against fatigue. Muscle of skmER\u03b1KO mice was weak regardless of physical activity. Although 20\u202fwk of wheel running partially prevented force loss during fatigue in skmER\u03b1KO mice, force production during recovery remained low, indicating that estradiol functions through ER\u03b1 in skeletal muscle.",

This systematic review investigates the influence that drugs with anti-inflammatory effects (AIDs) have on inflammation and skeletal muscle.PubMed and Web of Science were systematically screened for articles reporting the effects of AIDs on inflammation on one hand and on muscle mass and/or performance on the other.Twenty-eight articles were included. These articles were heterogeneous in terms of the subjects studied, intervention components, setting, and outcome measures. Articles on older humans with acute inflammation showed evidence that celecoxib and piroxicam could reduce inflammation and improve performance and that ibuprofen improves exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy and gains in strength. In younger humans, only the effects of AIDs combined with exercise were investigated; no significant benefits of non-selective COX-inhibitors were reported, but improved strength gains with etanercept and reduced muscle soreness with celecoxib were noted. Indomethacin increased acute exercise-induced inflammation and reduced satellite cell differentiation in exercising muscle. Most articles did not systematically report occurrences of side effects.Although AIDs showed significant reduction in inflammation-induced muscle weakness in older hospitalised patients with acute inflammation, robust evidence is still lacking. When combined with exercise, AIDs presented a protective effect against age-related loss of muscle mass, thus enhancing muscle mass and performance. The mechanism regulating muscle strength and its mass seems to differ between individuals of old and young age. However, the effects seem drug-specific and dose-dependent and appear to be influenced by subjects' trainability and the clinical context. In addition, the balance between benefits and harm remains unclear.",

Although it is impossible to stop aging artificially, regular exercises reportedly delay aging and have positive effects on senile diseases.

The exercise group performed both anaerobic and aerobic exercises for 12\u202fweeks, three times per week. Exercise intensity was increased gradually, from 40% to 70% of the heart rate reserve (HRR) every 3\u202fweeks. Insulin resistance, growth hormone, IGF-1, DHEA-S, and estrogen were measured before and after the 12-week intervention.The main effect was found in the glucose level for a time, which significantly decreased in the exercise group. The insulin level and HOMA-IR showed significant interaction effects and increased significantly in the control group. The GH level showed significant interaction effects and increased significantly in the exercise group. The IGF-1 level showed significant interaction effects, but not significantly within and between groups. The DHEA-S level revealed interaction effects and the main effect for a time and significantly increased in the exercise group. The estrogen level exhibited an interaction effect and increased significantly in the exercise group. After the 12-week combined exercise intervention, no significant difference was observed between groups.This study has shown that 12-week combined exercise is useful for improving insulin resistance and GH, IGF-1, and DHEA-S levels in elderly women. Thus, this study provides evidence that combined exercise is a useful therapeutic method to decrease insulin resistance and stimulate the secretion of aging-related hormones in elderly women.",

It has been suggested that exposure to infectious agents that stimulate the inflammatory response at early ages might have carry over effects in terms of accelerated senescence and increased mortality at late ages. However, not all pathogens and parasites have pro-inflammatory effects. In particular, parasitic nematodes have been shown to dampen the inflammatory response and to prevent or alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory diseases. We, therefore, tentatively predicted that early infection with a parasite that has anti-inflammatory properties might postpone aging. We tested this idea using the association between the nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus and its rodent host. In addition to the infection with H. polygyrus, we also activated the systemic inflammatory response with an Escherichia coli LPS injection, to explore the effect of H. polygyrus under control and inflammatory conditions. In addition to lifespan, we also assessed several biomarkers of aging, once the infection had been cleared. We found that both treatments (H. polygyrus infection and LPS challenge) reduced longevity. Most of the biomarkers of aging were affected by the previous infection status, suggesting that mice exposed to the nematode had an accentuated senescent phenotype. These results show that infection with immunomodulatory parasites per se does not prolong host lifespan and rather support the view that infection in early life accelerates the rate of aging.",

Falls were recorded prospectively over 12\u202fmonths with the assistance of carers.The populations mean MR was 79\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fcm and PR was 75\u202f\u00b1\u202f13\u202fcm, indicating participants tended to underestimate their reach ability. The large RJE tertile performed significantly poorer in measures of global cognition (ACE-R; OR 0.54 95%CI 0.31\u20130.95) and executive function (Trail Making Test B; OR 1.84 95%CI 1.00\u20133.36) and had increased concern about falling (Falls Efficacy Scale-International; OR 2.01 95% CI 1.06\u20133.79) compared to the minimal RJE tertile. The moderate and large RJE tertile groups had significantly slower hand reaction time and larger postural sway on foam compared to the minimal RJE tertile. Each 1% increase in RJE increased the risk of falls by 2% (RR 1.02 95%CI 1.01\u20131.03). This relationship withstood adjustment for other fall risk factors (sway on foam, Trail Making Test B and ACE-R).Inaccurate reach judgement predicts future falls and is associated with poorer global cognitive performance and executive function, increased concern about falling, slower reaction time and poorer balance. Our results offer insight into the disparity between actual and perceived physical capabilities in people with CI, and how this impacts their risk of falling.",

     "abstract": "Vascular endothelial cell (VEC) senescence is an initiating factor in numerous cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies showed that 17\u03b2-estradiol (17\u03b2-E2), an estrogen with numerous biological activities such as inhibition of atherosclerosis, protects VECs from senescence. However, the effects of 17\u03b2-E2 on human umbilical VECs (HUVECs) remain unknown. This study investigated the anti-senescent effect of 17\u03b2-E2 on HUVECs and explored the underlying mechanism with respect to autophagy and p53 activity. First, rapamycin and 3-methyladenine were used to clarify the relationship between autophagy and senescence in HUVECs, and an inverse relationship was demonstrated. Next, the effect of 17\u03b2-E2 on H2O2-induced senescence of HUVECs was examined. Increased autophagy induced by 17\u03b2-E2 inhibited H2O2-induced senescence of HUVECs, increased cell viability, and maintained HUVEC morphology. 17\u03b2-E2 pre-treatment also decreased cell cycle arrest, decreased the dephosphorylation of Rb, decreased the production of ET-1, and increased the production of NO. Most importantly, 17\u03b2-E2 pre-treatment increased autophagy by activating p53 and its downstream effector p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). Overall, our data indicate the critical role of autophagy in the anti-senescent effect of 17\u03b2-E2 on HUVECs.",

Participants completed 16\u202fweeks of resistance exercise training, followed by a 6-week detraining period. Maximal isokinetic torque (N.m) of right and left knee extension (PTRE/PTLE) and flexion (PTRF/PTLF) was measured at pre-training, post-training and immediately following the detraining period.Increased strength was observed in the LI\u202f+\u202fBFR_H, LI\u202f+\u202fBRF_L and HI groups post-training compared to baseline in the PTRE (\u0394%\u202f=\u202f27.2, 15.75 and 13.81%, p\u202f<\u202f.05, respectively), PTLE (\u0394%\u202f=\u202f25.2, 18.95 and 30.39%, p\u202f<\u202f.05, respectively), PTRF (\u0394%\u202f=\u202f36.7, 22.79 and 34.97%, p\u202f<\u202f.05, respectively) and PTLF in the groups (\u0394%\u202f=\u202f35.8, 24.93 and 26.14%, p\u202f<\u202f.05, respectively).

Muscle strength was well preserved following a 6-week detraining period, and although reductions were observed, some preservation of strength can be explained by possible neural adaptations to exercise.",

Sixty-two middle-aged and older adults (age range: 51\u201379\u202fyears) were recruited for this study. For each participant, we measured the carotid artery \u03b2-stiffness, oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) signal change in the prefrontal cortex during the Stroop task, and Stroop interference time. Correlation analyses revealed that the carotid artery \u03b2-stiffness was significantly correlated with the Stroop interference time (r\u202f=\u202f0.43, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and with the oxy-Hb signal change in the left (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.38, P\u202f=\u202f0.002), but not the right, prefrontal cortex.

     "abstract": "Lifespan extension under low temperature is well conserved across both endothermic and exothermic taxa, but the mechanism underlying this change in aging is poorly understood. Low temperature is thought to decrease metabolic rate, thus slowing the accumulation of cellular damage from reactive oxygen species, although recent evidence suggests involvement of specific cold-sensing biochemical pathways. We tested the effect of low temperature on aging in 11 strains of Brachionus rotifers, with the hypothesis that if the mechanism of lifespan extension is purely thermodynamic, all strains should have a similar increase in lifespan. We found differences in change in median lifespan ranging from a 6% decrease to a 100% increase, as well as differences in maximum and relative lifespan extension and in mortality rate. Low temperature delays reproductive senescence in most strains, suggesting an extension of healthspan, even in strains with little to no change in lifespan. The combination of low temperature and caloric restriction in one strain resulted in an additive lifespan increase, indicating these interventions may work via non- or partially-overlapping pathways. The known low temperature sensor TRPA1 is present in the rotifer genome, but chemical TRPA1 agonists did not affect lifespan, suggesting that this gene may be involved in low temperature sensation but not in chemoreception in rotifers. The congeneric variability in response to low temperature suggests that the mechanism of low temperature lifespan extension is an active genetic process rather than a passive thermodynamic one and is dependent upon genotype.",

Video analyses revealed that step length decreased in young while both step number and step length decreased in old adults. Beam width but not dual-tasking affected young adults' beam walking distance whereas both beam width and dual-tasking affected substantially and interactively old adults' beam walking distance and velocity. The results suggest that, if validated and cognitive performance also quantified, beam walking distance and walking velocity in single- and dual-tasking conditions could be a diagnostic tool of walking balance and cognitive impairment in aging.",

     "abstract": "Aging is characterized by progressive decline in biochemical and physiological functions. According to the free radical theory of aging, aging results from oxidative damage due to the accumulation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria are the main source of ROS production and are also the main target for ROS. Therefore, a diet high in antioxidant such as honey is potentially able to protect the body from ROS and oxidative damage. Gelam honey is higher in flavonoid content and phenolic compounds compared to other local honey. This study was conducted to determine the effects of gelam honey on age related protein expression changes in cardiac mitochondrial rat. A total of 24 Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into two groups: the young group (2\u202fmonths old), and aged group (19\u202fmonths old). Each group were then subdivided into two groups: control group (force-fed with distilled water), and treatment group (force-fed with gelam honey, 2.5\u202fg/kg), and were treated for 8\u202fmonths. Comparative proteomic analysis of mitochondria from cardiac tissue was then performed by high performance mass spectrometry (Q-TOF LCMS/MS) followed by validation of selected proteins by Western blotting. Proteins were identified using Spectrum Mill software and were subjected to stringent statistical analysis. A total of 286 proteins were identified in the young control group (YC) and 241 proteins were identified in the young gelam group (YG). In the aged group, a total of 243 proteins were identified in control group (OC), and 271 proteins in gelam group (OG). Comparative proteome profiling identified 69 proteins with different abundance (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) in OC when compared to YC, and also in YG when compared to YC. On the other hand, 55 proteins were found to be different in abundance when comparing OG with OC. In the aged group, gelam honey supplementation affected the relative abundance of 52 proteins with most of these proteins showing a decrease in the control group. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the majority of the affected proteins were involved in the respiratory chain (OXPHOS) which play an important role in maintaining mitochondrial function.",

The animals were exposed to exercise 3 times per week for 8\u202fweeks. The brains were collected for immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting assays. Our results showed that both types of exercise induced changes in motor performance and synaptic protein expression in adult and aged animals. However, acrobatic exercise promoted a greater number of changes, mainly in the aged animals. In addition, protein expression changes occurred in a greater number of brain areas in the aged animals than in adult animals. There were clear increases in synapsin-I expression in all areas analyzed of aged animals only after acrobatic exercises. On the other hand, synaptophysin increased in the same areas but with both types of exercise.

Here, we describe the procedures followed for PF&S case finding and screening of candidate participants for the SPRINTT RCT. We also illustrate the main demographic and clinical characteristics of eligible screenees.The identification of PF&S was based on the co-occurrence of three defining elements: (1) reduced physical performance (defined as a score on the Short Physical Performance Battery between 3 and 9); (2) low muscle mass according to the criteria released by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health; and (3) absence of mobility disability (defined as ability to complete the 400-m walk test in 15\u202fmin). SPRINTT was advertised through a variety of means. Site-specific case finding strategies were developed to accommodate the variability across centers in catchment area characteristics and access to the target population. A quick \u201cparticipant profiling\u201d questionnaire was devised to facilitate PF&S case finding.During approximately 22\u202fmonths, 12,358 prescreening interviews were completed in 17 SPRINTT sites resulting in 6710 clinic screening visits. Eventually, 1566 candidates were found to be eligible for participating in the SPRINTT RCT. Eligible screenees showed substantial physical function impairment and comorbidity burden. In most centers, project advertisement through mass media was the most rewarding case finding strategy.PF&S case finding in the community is a challenging, but feasible task. Although largely autonomous in daily life activities, older adults with PF&S suffer from significant functional impairment and comorbidity. This subset of the older population is therefore at high risk for disability and other negative health-related events. Key strategies to consider for successfully intercepting at-risk older adults should focus on mass communication methods.",

OM\u202f+\u202fOT improved osteogenic differentiation, observed by anticipated mineralization and increased gene expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin and osteocalcin in both aged relative to OM controls. These findings suggest a role for OT as an adjuvant to induce osteoblastic differentiation of BMMSCs from aged female rat.",

On the other hand, in a two-bottle test, avoidance of bitter and salty tastes increased, while preference for umami decreased with aging. To investigate the participation of peripheral taste detection systems in the observed changes, we analyzed both the expression of representative taste-related molecules and also turnover rates of taste bud cells. The mRNA expressions of the bitter taste receptor Tas2r105 and its coupled G protein gustducin were significantly decreased with aging. However, the majority of molecules tested did not show significant expression changes. In addition, no significant differences in the turnover rates of taste bud cells were observed between the two age groups. These results suggest that the changes in taste sensitivity of SAMP1 mice due to aging are caused by factors other than the deterioration of taste detection systems in the oral cavity.",

The objective of this study was to compare the median age at DA onset across nine European countries and to investigate the effects of income, occupation and wealth on DA onset after age 50. We used population samples aged 50\u202fyears and older from the SHARE (Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe) study. Participants from nine European countries with longitudinal data from at least three of the 2004/05, 2006/07, 2010/11, 2012/13 and 2014/15 waves were included in the analysis. A Frailty Index (FI, range 0\u20131) was constructed from 50 health deficits. DA onset was defined as having FI values\u202f>\u202f0.08 in at least two consecutive measurements following an initial FI value\u202f\u2264\u202f0.08. We investigated the effect of income, occupation and wealth on DA onset using a random effects model for time-to-event data. Potential confounding variables were identified using directed acyclic graphs. Out of 8616 (mean age 62\u202fyears, 49.0% female) participants initially at risk, 2640 (30.6%) experienced a subsequent DA onset. Median age at onset was 71\u202fyears overall, ranging from 66\u202fyears (Germany) to 76\u202fyears (Switzerland). Wealth and occupation were found to have significant effects on DA onset which decreased with age. In sum, the median age at DA onset differs between European countries. On an individual-level, wealth and occupation, but not income influence the age at DA onset.",

     "abstract": "The systemic and extra- gonadal levels of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) change during aging, and affect the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) in the immune cells of both females and males. The age-related cessation of ovarian function in females, as well as the tissue-specific expression of enzyme aromatase (estrogen synthase which significantly rises with the advancing age) in both males and females, both determine the concentration of E2 to which immune cells may be exposed. The present study was set up to investigate the direct influence of E2 in vitro on the secretory profile of peritoneal macrophages from young and naturally menopausal female rats, and from young and middle-aged male rats. The involvement of receptor(s) responsible for mediating the effects of E2 in vitro was examined by use of antagonists specific for ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2. Whereas in macrophages from young female rats E2 treatment diminished interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 secretion, it increased it in young males, and the middle-aged females. The in vitro E2 treatment increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 release by macrophages from young rats of both sexes, while it increased macrophage IL-6 release independently of both sex and age. At the same time, E2 decreased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in macrophages from females, and increased it in male rats of both ages, whereas it diminished nitric oxide (NO) release in all experimental groups. Inspite of the sex- and age-specific effects of E2 on macrophage urea release, E2 did not affect the NO/urea ratio in macrophages from female rats, and diminished it in macrophages from both young and middle-aged male rats. Independently of the sex and age, E2 stimulated the release of inflammatory cytokines predominantly via macrophage ER\u03b1, and inhibited the IL-1\u03b2 release in young females via ER\u03b2. In contrast, E2 increased macrophage H2O2 and urea production by activating ER\u03b2, but diminished their release via ER\u03b1. Our study may contribute to better understanding of the complex role(s) that E2 may play in innate immunity during aging, and that are dependent of sex.",

     "abstract": "It is well established that older adults are less able to perform attentionally demanding motor tasks, placing them at greater risk of accident-related injury. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether the interplay between prefrontal and motor cortex activity could predict such age-related performance deficits. Using a dual-task (DT) paradigm, 15 younger and 15 older adults participated in experiment 1, where brain activity was simultaneously measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Experiment 1 demonstrated poorer performance for the older group across a range of DTs combining visuomotor arm tracking with a secondary cognitive or motor task. Interestingly however, older adults' DT performance error was isolated to the motor component of DTs. TMS data revealed reduced motor cortex (M1) inhibition during DTs for older adults, and a trend for this correlating with poorer performance. In contrast, poorer performing younger adults showed significantly higher M1 inhibition. Experiment 2 was conducted given a high amount of movement artifact in experiment 1 fNIRS data. Using fNIRS to measure prefrontal, premotor, and motor cortex activity in an additional 15 older adults, we found no evidence of an interplay between these regions predicting DT performance. Nevertheless, performance data replicated experiment 1 in showing that DT error was isolated to motor tasks in older adults, with no significant cognitive task error. Overall, this study shows that older adults seemed to adopt a \u2018cognitive-first\u2019 prioritisation strategy during the DTs involved in our study, and that deficits in DT performance may be related to the modulation of M1 inhibitory mechanisms. We propose that clinicians advise older adults to allocate greater attention to motor tasks during activities where they may be at risk of accident-related injury.",

Anthropometric parameters (weight, height and body circumferences) were determined. Body composition was evaluated using conventional bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and vector bioimpedance analysis (BIVA) (whole-body and calf BIVAs), and muscle strength was determined (manual dynamometry). The results were analyzed using the Student t-test or the Mann-Whitney U, and the correlations using the Pearson or Spearman test. To compare BIVA results among the subgroups established, the Mahalanobis distance (dM) was calculated and the Hotelling T2 statistic was used. Statistical significance was set to p\u202f<\u202f0.05.Nearly half the sample was overweight. Based on waist circumference, 66.7% of the males and 94.9% of the females showed risk of metabolic complications; calf circumference indicated no risk of disability or skeletal muscle mass depletion. However, BIA and dynamometry detected risk of sarcopenia in more than half the subjects. Whole-body BIVA results agreed with those of the BIA, given that most impedance vectors in both sexes were to the right of major axis of the tolerance ellipses. This shows cell mass depletion. While the whole-body BIVA distinguished the subjects having loss of muscle mass and strength, the specific BIVA (calf) only did so in individuals with muscle mass loss.Whole-body BIVA detects loss of muscle mass and strength, while calf BIVA only distinguishes subjects having muscle mass loss. The localized BIVA might be an alternative to conventional BIA or whole-body BIVA to assess body composition in the elderly.",

This study aimed to examine whether BIS can explain a part of the inter-individual variation of the muscle size-strength relationship in older adults. We analyzed the data of 79 participants aged 64\u201386\u202fyears. The maximal voluntary isometric torques of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion on the right side were measured. The anterior and posterior muscle thickness (MT) in the right lower leg was assessed using ultrasonography. The length of the right lower leg (L) was measured, and the ICW-to-TW ratio (ICW/TW) in the right lower leg was obtained using BIS. The MT was multiplied by L to represent an index of muscle volume (MV). Correlation and stepwise regression analyses were performed. The anterior and posterior MT\u202f\u00d7\u202fL significantly and positively correlated with the muscle torque of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion (r\u202f=\u202f0.710 and 0.649, respectively, P\u202f<\u202f0.001). In the stepwise regression analyses, ICW/TW was selected as a significant predictor of muscle torque independent of MT\u202f\u00d7\u202fL (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) for both dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Electrical parameters of BIS (membrane capacitance, characteristics frequency, and phase angle) in the lower leg also significantly correlated with muscle torques. In addition, the skeletal muscle mass index (appendicular lean mass/height2) was also associated with ICW/TW (P\u202f<\u202f0.001).

However, a cross comparison of these longevity pathways using a multi-omics integration approach is lacking. In this study, we aimed to identify key pathways and metabolite fingerprints of longevity that are shared between IIS and CR worm models using multi-omics integration. We generated transcriptomics and metabolomics data from long-lived worm strains, i.e. daf-2 (impaired IIS) and eat-2 (CR model) and compared them with the wild-type strain N2. Transcriptional profiling identified shared longevity signatures, such as an upregulation of lipid storage and defense responses, and downregulation of macromolecule synthesis and developmental processes. Metabolomics profiling identified an increase in the levels of glycerol\u20113P, adenine, xanthine, and AMP, and a decrease in the levels of the amino acid pool, as well as the C18:0, C17:1, C19:1, C20:0 and C22:0 fatty acids. After we integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics data based on the annotations in KEGG, our results highlighted increased amino acid metabolism and an upregulation of purine metabolism as a commonality between the two long-lived mutants. Overall, our findings point towards the existence of shared metabolic pathways that are likely important for lifespan extension and provide novel insights into potential regulators and metabolic fingerprints for longevity.",

It has been reported that sarcopenia can be attenuated by exercise training. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether long-term high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) protocols could differentially modulate changes in body composition, physical performance, inflammatory parameters, and adipocytokines in fat tissues and serum, as well as oxidative parameters and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in skeletal muscle tissue of aged rats. Middle-aged (18-month-old) female Sprague Dawley rats (n\u202f=\u202f36) were subjected to 8\u202fmonths of MICT (26\u2013m MICT) or HIIT (26\u2013m HIIT) treadmill training (45\u202fmin, 5 times per week), and the results were compared with those of age-matched sedentary controls (26\u2013m SED); 8-month-old (8\u2013m SED) and 18-month-old (18\u2013m SED) rats served as aging sedentary controls. Body composition parameters; physical performance; serum and skeletal muscle oxidative stress parameters; levels of IGF-1, a serum and fat tissue inflammatory marker; adipocytokine (leptin, adiponectin) levels; and plasma glucose and lipid metabolism-related parameters were analyzed among the five groups. The percent fat and body fat to lean mass ratio increased as a main effect with age, whereas 26\u2013m HIIT but not 26\u2013m MICT attenuated these alterations. The 26\u2013m HIIT group showed a larger improvement in grip strength compared to that of 26\u2013m MICT, with a similar increase in inclined plane performance, maximum running speed, and exhaustion over time as compared with the 26\u2013m SED group. Notably, the 26\u2013m HIIT group showed lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and higher IL-10 in serum compared with those of the 26\u2013m SED and 26\u2013m MICT groups. Both exercise protocols promoted increased skeletal muscle IGF-1 and decreased serum IGF-1 and adiponectin relative to those in the 26\u2013m SED group, whereas only 26\u2013m HIIT dampened the age-related decrease in plasma free fatty acids and increased serum leptin, along with providing lower fat tissue leptin as compared with that in the 26\u2013m SED group. Moreover, the 26\u2013m HIIT group showed lower serum and skeletal muscle malonylaldehyde and skeletal muscle 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels than those in the 26\u2013m MICT group, albeit similar decreases in serum and skeletal muscle 4-hydroxynonenal and serum 8-OHdG and increases in skeletal muscle superoxide dismutase 2 activity. In conclusion, HIIT initiated late in life exhibited greater beneficial effects in ameliorating aged-related elevations in oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as dysfunction of circulating adipocytokine levels, than a volume-matched MICT program. HIIT may therefore contribute to improvements in body composition and physical performance changes associated with aging.",

Gait coordination was reduced in older adults while walking at their self-selected pace, as was cortical inhibition, solely in the non-dominant motor cortex. Furthermore, young adults were better able to maintain lower extremity coordination and variability with reduced cortical inhibition, whereas older adults with increased cortical inhibition demonstrated better walking performance.

In the elderly, 25-OHD correlated with CSAc (partial R2\u202f=\u202f0.33), fracture load x (partial R2\u202f=\u202f0.54), and fracture load y (partial R2\u202f=\u202f0.46) for the radius, and marginally with BMDt (partial R2\u202f=\u202f0.09; B-H adjusted p\u202f<\u202f0.05 for all) for the tibia. FFM correlated with all bone parameters in both age groups. In the elderly group alone, FM correlated with BMDt at the tibia (r\u202f=\u202f0.25, p\u202f<\u202f0.05), with CSA at both sites (radius r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.25, p\u202f<\u202f0.05; tibia r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.32, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), and with fracture load y on the radius (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.22, p\u202f<\u202f0.05).While serum 25-OHD levels correlated only weakly with bone parameters in younger adults, a significant relationship was observed for elderly people. Fat-free mass showed positive simple correlation with pQCT-derived bone parameters in both age groups except with BMDc in the younger group. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify these relationships.",

     "abstract": "Periodization is a systematic training calendar designed to provide variations in performance targeting, while maximizing results and reducing the potential for overtraining. When provided across multiple weeks, termed a mesocycle, it may also incorporate active recovery periods using specified drills designed to translate neuromuscular gains into targeted functional abilities. There are a number of models that can be used when applying periodization to resistance training (RT). Among the most common are the linear (LP) and daily fixed non-linear (NLP) models. It is currently unknown whether an optimal periodization strategy exists that will maximize benefits for older adults; therefore, we compared the impact of these two periodization models on neuromuscular and functional measures in a group of older persons living independently in the community.Thirty-six older adults, 58\u201380\u202fyears of age, were randomly assigned to either a LP (n\u202f=\u202f16; 69.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.6\u202fy) or NLP (n\u202f=\u202f14; 68.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.7\u202fy) group. The LP group performed 12\u202fweeks of training comprised of separate 4-week strength and power training cycles, each followed by a 2-week recovery period incorporating translational exercises. The NLP group performed the strength, power, and translational training on three separate days during the week. Neuromuscular testing included seated chest press and leg press strength and power tests, while physical function testing included the gallon jug shelf test, laundry transfer test, floor stand-up, chair-to-stand test, and 8\u202ffoot timed up-and-go.3 (time)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (sex)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (group) repeated measures ANOVA revealed both periodization strategies were equally effective at inducing neuromuscular and functional improvements and that men generally produced more strength and power than women.Both LP and NLP can be used to improve strength, power, and functional performance in healthy untrained older adults when strength, power and functional training cycles are involved. Therefore, personal preference and variety should be considered when deciding which approach to use, provided high-speed power and translational recovery components are included.",

Included amongst these alterations is histone acetylation, which may play a crucial role in aging. Thus, the aims of the present study were to standardize the animal model of d-galactose (d-gal), and to evaluate the effects caused by sodium butyrate (SB), which is a histone deacetylase inhibitor on memory, the modulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs), and also DNA damage in 2, 6 or 16-month-old Wistar rats which were subjected to administrations of d-gal. To help choose the best dose of d-gal for the induction of the aging model, we performed a dose-response curve (100, 200 or 300\u202fmg/kg). d-Gal was administered orally to the 2-month-old rats for a period of 30\u202fdays. After this, d-gal (200\u202fmg/kg) or water were administered to the 2, 6 or 16-month-old rats for a period of 30\u202fdays. On the 24th day, treatment was started with SB (600\u202fmg/kg) intraperitoneally, for a period of 7\u202fdays. SB was able to reverse the damage to habituation memory caused by d-gal in the 2 and 6-month-old rats, but was unable to reverse the damage in the 16\u202fmonth-old animals. In addition, SB was able to reverse the damage caused by natural aging in the 16-month-old animals. In the inhibitory avoidance task, SB improved the damage caused by d-gal in the 2, 6 and 16-month-old animals and had the same result against the effects of natural aging in the 16-month-old rats. Moreover, d-gal caused an increase in the level of HDACs activity in the 16-month-old animals, and SB was able to reverse this effect in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The 16-month-old animals showed an increase in the frequency of DNA damage in peripheral blood, and SB was able to reduce this damage. Moreover, d-gal caused an increase in the index and frequency of DNA damage in the 2 and 6-month-old animals, and treatment with SB was able to prevent this damage. Thus, the present study showed the protective effects of SB on the memory of naturally aged and d-gal induced aging in rats. Therefore, the present study shows new findings for the use of SB in aging.",

Due to its importance in metabolic and inflammation regulation, fat is a prime tissue for health span determination as well as a prime target for DR. We aimed to determine here whether the beneficial effects of DR would be retained over a subsequent period of ad libitum (AL) feeding.Male mice were kept under either 40% DR or AL feeding regimes from 3 to 12\u202fmonths of age and then either switched back to the opposite feeding regimen or kept in the same state for another 3\u202fmonths. Visceral adipose tissue from 4 to 5 mice per group for all conditions was analysed for markers of senescence (adipocyte size, \u03b3H2A.X, p16, p21) and inflammation (e.g. IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) using immuno-staining or qPCR. Macrophages were detected by immunohistochemistry.We found that both 9 and 12\u202fmonths DR (long term) as well as 3\u202fmonth (short term, mid-life onset) DR reduced the number of cells harbouring DNA damage and adipocyte size (area and perimeter) in visceral adipocytes with similar efficiency. Importantly, beneficial health markers induced by DR such as small adipocyte size and low DNA damage were maintained for at least 3\u202fmonth after termination of DR, demonstrating that the previously identified \u2018metabolic memory\u2019 of the DR state in male mice extends to senescence markers in visceral fat.",

These health benefits are assumed to come from a compound from grape skin called resveratrol, which has been proposed to be a pro-longevity agent. Whether resveratrol accounts for all the health benefits of grape-derived nutrients and the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of such nutrients are not well understood. Here we investigated the effect of supplementing grape skin extract (GSE) left from red wine-production process to the daily food intake of a Drosophila melanogaster model of Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) loss-of-function. Consumption of GSE resulted in rescue of mitochondrial morphological defects, improvement of indirect flight muscle function and health-span, and prolonged lifespan of the PINK1 mutant flies. Further biochemical and genetic studies revealed a link between activation of mitophagy and the beneficial effects of GSE. Our results indicate that GSE can promote autophagy activation, preserve mitochondria function, and protect against PD pathogenesis, and that the beneficial effect of GSE in mitophagy activation is not accounted for by resveratrol alone.",

We identified sarcopenia using grip strength, Timed Up-and-Go and bioimpedance analysis. We assessed mitochondrial respiratory chain function using phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy, estimating \u03c41/2 PCr, the recovery half-time of phosphocreatine in the calf muscles following a bout of aerobic exercise. We performed a biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle and assessed mitochondrial respiratory chain content by measuring levels of subunits of complex I and IV of the respiratory chain, expressed as Z-scores relative to that in young controls.Participants had a median (IQR) of 2 (1,3) long-term conditions, reported regular aerobic physical activity, and one participant (5.3%) had sarcopenia. Sixteen participants completed the magnetic resonance protocol and the mean (SD) \u03c41/2 PCr of 35.6 (11.3) seconds was in keeping with preserved mitochondrial function. Seven participants underwent muscle biopsy and the mean fibre Z-scores were \u22120.7 (0.7) and \u22120.2 (0.4) for complexes I and IV, respectively, suggesting preserved content of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes.Muscle mitochondrial respiratory chain function and content are preserved in a sample of active, well-functioning 85-year-olds, among whom sarcopenia was uncommon.

     "abstract": "Age is a major risk factor for developing chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. Emerging evidences suggest that the disorder of bone metabolism in osteoporosis is involved in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, their etiology and relative regulatory factors still remain elusive to clinicians and researchers. In this study, rats were divided into two groups: normal sham surgery control and ovariectomized (OVX) groups. We evaluated the global bone parameters, glucose metabolism, protein and gene expressions in both skeletal muscle and adipocytes. The present findings showed that the bone mineral density (BMD) and compression load of bone were markedly reduced in OVX rats as revealed by micro-CT, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and bone biomechanics analysis. Besides, plasma estrogen, total alkaline phosphatase (TALP) and osteocalcin levels were significantly decreased in the OVX rats, but body weight, fat mass and plasma tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and chemerin levels were significantly increased in the OVX rats. More interestingly, we found that p-AKT, p-P38MAPK, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) contents as well as GLUT4 and PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression were significantly decreased in skeletal muscle and adipocytes of OVX rats. In conclusion, our results indicated that whole-body glucose metabolism and glucose intolerance in OVX rats was degressive, suggesting there was a novel link between osteoporosis and whole body glucose homeostasis, which are controlled by the P38MAPK/PGC-1\u03b1/GLUT4 signaling pathway.",

Older adults are less physically active than the rest of the population, and interventions that promote physical activity are needed.

Studies whose comparator groups were engaged in active or inactive interventions, such as continued a physical therapy program or goal-setting counseling, were not excluded simply for implementing co-interventions. We used random-effects models to produce standardized mean differences (SMDs) for physical activity outcomes. Heterogeneity was measured using I2.Nine studies met the eligibility criteria: Four using accelerometers, four using pedometers, and one comparing accelerometers and pedometers, for a total number of 939 participants. Using pooled data, we found a statistically significant effect of using accelerometers (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.43 (95%CI 0.19\u20130.68), I2\u202f=\u202f1.6%, p\u202f=\u202f0.298), but not by using pedometers (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.17 (95%CI \u22120.08\u20130.43), I2\u202f=\u202f37.7%, p\u202f=\u202f0.174) for increasing physical activity levels.In this study, we found that accelerometers, alone or in combination with other co-interventions, increased physical activity in older adults however pedometers were not found to increase physical activity.

     "abstract": "Sensorimotor integration is the process through which somatosensory information is incorporated to inform motor output. Given its important behavioural implications, understanding the influence of healthy aging on the underlying neurophysiology of sensorimotor integration and whether it is modifiable through intervention is important. The aims of the current work were to: 1) profile aging-related differences in sensorimotor integration, and 2) to determine if sensorimotor integration in older adults can be modulated in response to sensory training.A group of older healthy individuals and younger healthy individuals participated in two experimental sessions. First, baseline neurophysiology of sensorimotor integration was assessed. Short-latency afferent inhibition, afferent facilitation, and long-latency afferent inhibition provided nerve-based assessment of sensorimotor integration. Vibration-based measures of sensorimotor integration combined vibration of abductor pollicis brevis with single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques. In the second experimental session, a 15-min block of sensory training designed to modulate sensorimotor integration preceded the same neurophysiological assessment.Results indicate that there are aging-related differences in nerve-based measures of sensorimotor integration, specifically short- and long-latency afferent inhibition. In contrast, there are not aging-related differences when peripheral muscle belly vibration is used to probe sensorimotor integration. Following sensory training there is a reduction in the cortical response to vibration.These results suggest that there is differential aging-related modulation of sensorimotor integration, based on the type of afferent information. Additionally, sensorimotor integration is modifiable with a single session of sensory training, and this ability for neuroplastic change is retained with healthy aging.",

     "abstract": "Growing evidence shows that enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is an important contributor to obesity and its co-morbidities, but the functional link between ROS and obesity remains elusive. In this study we used the model animal Caenorhabditis elegans to explore the role of ROS in obesity. Initially, when ROS production was enhanced by treatment with low concentration of paraquat or juglone, both abnormal high fat accumulation and fatty acid composition were observed in wild type worms. We found that the abnormal fat accumulation was associated with increased expression of fat-5, which encodes an isoform of stearoyl-CoA synthetase, and which is regulated by daf-16 encoding the forkhead transcription factor and being activated by downregulation daf-2. When mutant daf-16 worms were used, the abnormal fat accumulation induced by ROS was suppressed. Collectively, we demonstrate that enhanced ROS production can lead to excessive fat accumulation and the change of fatty acid composition. This abnormal phenomenon at least in part depends on the daf-16 pathway by which fat-5 was regulated. The results point towards a role of ROS in obesity in the context of important conserved signaling pathway, thereby guide further studies and future therapeutic interventions.",

However, no validated alternatives exist to the usually expensive instruments and/or time-consuming methods to evaluate muscle power in older populations. Our aim was to validate an easily applicable procedure to assess muscle power in large cohort studies and the clinical setting and to assess its association with other age-related outcomes.Forty community dwelling older adults (70\u201387\u202fyears) and 1804 older subjects (67\u2013101\u202fyears) participating in the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging were included in this investigation. Sit-to-stand (STS) velocity and muscle power were calculated using the subject's body mass and height, chair height and the time needed to complete five STS repetitions, and compared with those obtained in the leg press exercise using a linear position transducer. In addition, STS performance, physical (gait speed) and cognitive function, sarcopenia (skeletal muscle index (SMI)) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were recorded to assess the association with the STS muscle power values.No significant differences were found between STS velocity and power values and those obtained from the leg press force-velocity measurements (mean difference\u202f\u00b1\u202f95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05\u202fm\u00b7s\u22121 and 6.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f29.8\u202fW, respectively) (both p\u202f>\u202f0.05). STS muscle power was strongly associated with maximal muscle power registered in the leg press exercise (r\u202f=\u202f0.72; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). In addition, cognitive function and SMI, and physical function, were better associated with absolute and relative STS muscle power, respectively, than STS time values after adjusting by different covariates. In contrast, STS time was slightly more associated with HRQoL than STS muscle power measures.The STS muscle power test proved to be a valid, and in general, a more clinically relevant tool to assess functional trajectory in older people compared to traditional STS time values. The low time, space and material requirements of the STS muscle power test, make this test an excellent choice for its application in large cohort studies and the clinical setting.",

We calculated Odds Ratio's (ORs), Incidence Rate Ratio's (IRRs) and their 95% Confidential Intervals (CI95) using multivariable regression and negative binomial regression analyses. We adjusted for cognitive functioning, depression, the use of fall risk increasing drugs, visual impairment, urine incontinence, comorbidity, smoking, use of alcohol, body mass index (BMI), and the number of months between assessment of fall risk and of apathy. We assessed effect modification by age and gender.In our study, apathy was independently associated with recurrent falling in patients aged 65\u201375\u202fyears: OR 2.8 (CI95 1.0\u20137.7). Overall, patients with apathy experienced 1.46 times as many falls in the past 12\u202fmonths compared to patients without apathy (IRR 1.46 (CI95 1.0\u20132.1).To conclude, in high fall-risk older outpatients, apathy was cross-sectionally associated with recurrent falling in patients aged 65\u201375\u202fyears and the number of falls. Apathy appeared to be especially relevant in relation to falling in this age group. Whether apathy predicts recurrent falling is yet to be determined.",

     "abstract": "Acceleration capacity affects physical function, but whether it differentially affects men versus women or weak versus strong individuals is less known. We investigated whether knee extension rate of velocity development (RVD, a measure of acceleration) is associated with walking performance independent of peak torque and whether the relationships differ in men versus women and in weak versus strong individuals.Relationships of RVD with walking performance were assessed in 326 women and 365 men aged 26\u201396\u202fyears enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Tests included knee extension peak torque and RVD assessed during a 180\u00b0\u00b7s\u22121 isokinetic strength test and four walking performance measures (usual-paced and fast-paced 6\u202fm walks and 2.5\u202fmin usual-paced and 400\u202fm fast-paced walks). Sex-stratified linear regression models were adjusted for age, race, height, appendicular lean mass, fat mass, peak torque, knee pain, and RVD*peak torque interaction.In men, RVD was not independently associated with any walking performance measure (p\u202f>\u202f0.05), and, for the 6\u202fm-usual walk only, there was a significant RVD*peak torque interaction (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). In women, RVD was independently associated with usual-paced walks (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and there were significant RVD\u202f\u2217\u202fpeak torque interactions for all measures. Strength-specific analyses indicated that RVD was most associated with performance among weaker individuals.RVD is associated with walking performance in women, but less in men, and is most related to performance when strength is low. Strategies to accomplish motor tasks may be sex-specific. Future studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying such sex differences.",

The present study examines cross-sectional and prospective associations between different volumes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and walking, and depressive symptoms and status. Participants (n\u202f=\u202f4556; 56.7% female) aged\u202f\u2265\u202f50\u202fyears completed the International PA Questionnaire (IPAQ) at baseline and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at baseline and two years later. Prevalence and incidence of depression were 9.0% (n\u202f=\u202f410) and 5.0% (n\u202f=\u202f207), respectively. After full adjustment, odds of prevalent depression were: 40% (OR\u202f=\u202f0.60, 95%CI: 0.48\u20130.76) lower among those meeting PA guidelines; 23% (OR\u202f=\u202f0.77, 0.49\u20131.21) and 43% (OR\u202f=\u202f0.57, 0.45\u20130.73) lower among those in moderate and high categories, respectively; and, 22% (OR\u202f=\u202f0.78, 0.61\u20131.01) and 44.0% (OR\u202f=\u202f0.56, 0.42\u20130.74) lower among those in moderate and high walking tertiles, respectively.

     "abstract": "Cognition, along with aerobic and muscular fitness, declines with age. Although research has shown that resistance and aerobic exercise may improve cognition, no consensus exists supporting the use of one approach over the other. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of steady-state, moderate-intensity treadmill training (TM) and high-velocity circuit resistance training (HVCRT) on cognition, and to examine its relationships to aerobic fitness and neuromuscular power.Thirty older adults were randomly assigned to one of three groups: HVCRT, TM, or control. Exercise groups attended training 3\u202fdays/wk for 12\u202fweeks, following a 2\u202fweek adaptation period. The NIH Cognitive Toolbox was used to assess specific components of cognition and provided an overall fluid composite score (FCS). The walking response and inhibition test (WRIT) was specifically used to assess executive function (EF) and provided an accuracy (ACC), reaction time (RT) and global score (GS). Aerobic power (AP) and maximal neuromuscular power (MP) were measured pre- and post-intervention. Relationships between variables using baseline and mean change scores were assessed.Significant increases were seen from baseline in ACC (MD\u202f=\u202f14.0, SE\u202f=\u202f4.3, p\u202f=\u202f.01, d\u202f=\u202f1.49), GS (MD\u202f=\u202f25.6, SE\u202f=\u202f8.0, p\u202f=\u202f.01, d\u202f=\u202f1.16), and AP (MD\u202f=\u202f1.4, SE\u202f=\u202f0.6, p\u202f=\u202f.046, d\u202f=\u202f0.31) for HVCRT.

No significant within-group differences were detected for TM or CONT. Significant correlations were seen at baseline between AP and FCS, as well as other cognitive domains; but none were detected among change scores. Although no significant correlation was evident between MP and FCS or GS, there was a trend toward higher MP values being associated with higher FCS and GS scores.Our results support the use of HVCRT over TM for improving cognition in older persons, although the precise mechanisms that underlie this association remain unclear.",

In contrast to coronary heart disease and heart failure there is a limited amount of published data concerning the increased prevalence of depression among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Therefore, we decided to assess the prevalence of depression in Polish community-dwelling older patients with a history of AF.The data were collected as part of the nationwide PolSenior project (2007\u20132012). Out of 4979 individuals (age range 65\u2013104\u202fyears), data on self-reported history of AF were available for 4677 (93.9%). Finally, 4049 participants without suspected moderate or severe dementia in Mini Mental State Examination test were assessed with the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and a score of 6 points and more was regarded as suspected depression.Mean age (\u00b1SD) of the study population was 78.1 (\u00b18.3) years; 52% were males. The history of AF was reported by 788 (19.5%) subjects. In the univariate analysis a self-reported AF history was associated with 42% increase of suspected depression (41% vs 29%; P\u202f<\u202f0.001). In multivariate logistic regression AF remained an independent predictor of depression (OR\u202f=\u202f1.69; 95%CI: 1.43\u20132.00), stronger than heart failure, diabetes or coronary heart disease.In community-dwelling geriatric Polish population AF is associated with higher prevalence of depression.

     "abstract": "An age-related dysregulation of immune response, known as immunosenescence, contributes to increased susceptibility to infections, frailty and high risk of mortality in the elderly. Torquetenovirus (TTV), a circular, single-stranded DNA virus, is highly prevalent in the general population and it may persist in the organism, also in association with other viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), causing chronic viremia. The relationship that TTV establishes with the immune system of infected hosts is not clear. It is known that TTV encodes microRNAs (miRNAs) that might contribute to immune evasion and that the highest viral loads are found in peripheral blood cells. Moreover, it is suspected that TTV infection lead to increased production of inflammatory mediators, thus playing a role in immunosenescence. We investigated the association of TTV load and miRNAs expression with inflammatory and immune markers and the influence of TTV load on mortality within a cohort of 379 elderly subjects who were followed up for 3\u202fyears. TTV DNA load in polymorphonuclear leukocytes was slightly positively correlated with age and negatively associated with serum albumin levels and NK cell activity. A marginal positive correlation between TTV DNA load, monocytes and IL-8 plasma levels was found in females and males respectively. TTV DNA copies \u22654.0 log represented a strong predictor of mortality (Hazard ratio\u202f=\u202f4.78, 95% CI: 1.70\u201313.44, after adjusting for age, sex and the main predictors of mortality rate) and this association remained significant even after the CMV IgG antibody titer was included in the model (HR\u202f=\u202f9.83; 95% CI: 2.48\u201338.97; N\u202f=\u202f343 subjects). Moreover, multiple linear regression model showed that TTV miRNA-t3b of genogroup 3 was inversely associated with triglycerides, monocytes and C-reactive protein, and directly associated with IL6. Overall these findings suggest a role of TTV in immunesenescence and in the prediction of all-cause mortality risk in Italian elderly subjects. Further studies are needed to fully understand the pathogenic mechanisms of TTV infection during aging.",

The KT group received an 8-week training intervention involving 60-min sessions twice a week, whereas the CON group members continued their daily lifestyles without participating in any exercise training. Four weeks of detraining were organized to observe the retention effect of the training program on the KT group.The participants' body composition, muscle strength, pulmonary function, and chronic low-grade inflammatory markers were measured and analyzed before training (at Week 0, W0), after 8\u202fweeks of training (at Week 8, W8), and after 4\u202fweeks of detraining (at Week 12, W12).In the KT group, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) and the sarcopenia index measured at W8 and W12 were significantly higher than those at W0(p\u202f=\u202f.004; p\u202f=\u202f.005).

     "abstract": "Frailty is a progressive physiologic decline in multiple body systems, characterized by loss of function, loss of physiologic reserve, and increased vulnerability to disease and death. This condition is induced by a complex and multifactorial interaction between genetic, biological, physical, psychological and environmental factors. To understand the interplay between the age-related decline of the immune response, and the upregulation of the inflammatory response, the so called inflammaging, we investigated the role of different inflammatory mediators on frailty status in the elderly. The study was performed in a population of 180 older adults (\u226565\u202fyears), who were classified according to Fried's frailty phenotype. Plasma concentrations of neopterin, tryptophan, kynurenine, phenylalanine, tyrosine as well as kynurenine/tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) and phenylalanine/tyrosine (Phe/Tyr) ratios were analyzed as immune stimulation biomarkers. In addition, nitrite and C-reactive protein levels were measured as indicators of nitric oxide production and acute inflammation, respectively. Significant increases in neopterin, C-reactive protein and Kyn/Trp ratio, and decreases in tryptophan and nitrite concentrations in frail individuals compared with non-frail group were found. Both Kyn/Trp and Phe/Tyr ratios were significantly and positively correlated with neopterin. A positive correlation between kynurenine and tryptophan was also observed. Four parameters, i.e., neopterin, tryptophan, nitrite and C-reactive protein, were found to be strongly related to frailty status, although only nitrite confirmed its role of predictor after multiple regression analysis, supporting its use as a potential biomarker of frailty. Further investigation is required to strengthen the consistence and reproducibility of these findings, and to establish this parameter as a clinical biomarker of frailty.",

Older fallers present lower maximal plantar-flexor performance than older non-fallers; however, the mechanisms underlying this motor impairment remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to determine whether muscular and neural factors are both involved in the lower maximal plantar-flexor performance of older fallers. The maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque, resting twitch torque, voluntary activation level (VAL), and electromyographic (EMG) activities for the soleus, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis and tibialis anterior during plantar-flexor MVCs were recorded in 23 older non-fallers (age: 83.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.9\u202fyears) and 25 older fallers (age: 84.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.1\u202fyears). The maximal plantar-flexor Hoffmann reflex normalized to the maximal motor potential (Hmax/Mmax) was measured to assess the efficacy of spinal transmission from the Ia-afferent fibers to the \u03b1-motoneurons. Older fallers presented lower plantar-flexor MVC torque, resting twitch torque, VAL and EMG activity (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). No significant differences between older fallers and non-fallers were found for the Hmax/Mmax ratio and dorsi-flexor coactivation. The current findings showed for the first time that both neural and muscular factors associated with the plantar-flexors contributed to the specific alteration of maximal motor performance in older fallers. The lack of a difference in the Hmax/Mmax ratio indicated that the efficacy of spinal transmission from the Ia-afferent fibers to the \u03b1-motoneurons was not involved in the lower voluntary muscle activation of older fallers. This suggests that supraspinal centers are likely to be involved in the lower voluntary muscle activation observed in older fallers.",

Linear regressions were performed to assess the associations of father's and mother's age at birth and the parental age gap, i.e. the difference between maternal and paternal age with LTL and LTL change.A one year increase in father's age corresponded to a 0.26% (95% CI: 0.04\u20130.47%) increase in offspring LTL at age 53 in the sex-adjusted model.

     "abstract": "Hip fractures are a global concern, resulting in poor outcomes and high health care costs. They mostly affect people >80\u202fyears. Hip fractures are influenced by various (modifiable) risk factors. Emerging evidence suggests hand grip strength (HGS) to be one of several useful tools to identify hip fracture risk. This is the first systematic review that aims to assess the evidence underlying the relationship between hip fracture incidence and HGS.Eleven studies were selected for this review (six case-control and five cohort studies), comprising 21,197 participants. Where reported, HGS was significantly decreased in individuals with a hip fracture near the time of injury as compared to controls (p\u202f<\u202f0.001); HGS was associated with increased hip fracture risk in all included studies. Meta-analysis was not possible.All studies included in this systematic review confirmed a relationship between decreased HGS and hip fracture incidence. We were not able to quantify the strength of this relationship, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. HGS merits further investigation as a useful tool for identifying individuals that might be at elevated risk for sustaining a hip fracture.",

     "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative chronic disease affecting >300,000 million people around the world as of 2016. Symptomatic measures exist, but there are hardly any curative treatments available. Disruption of the cartilage homeostasis in favor of catabolism leads to cartilage destruction. ROS-macromolecular-induced damage is significantly greater in OA cartilage and OA is described as low-grade chronic systemic inflammation. This review aimed to assess the critical role of cartilage ageing and oxidative stress in the OA process, focusing in particular on NADPH oxidase and especially Nox4 involvement. With age, hypertrophic senescent cells with an altered redox cell profile accumulated. Chondrocytes are more sensitive to oxidant-mediators and the serum level of pro-inflammatory mediators increases. Age-related advanced glycation end products impact on extra cellular matrix (ECM) properties leading to the apoptosis of chondrocytes. A focus on NADPH oxidase-mediated-ROS signaling highlighted the very specific Nox4 isoform, which plays a role on the final common pathway targeting chondrocyte cells. IL-1\u03b2-mediated Nox4 stimulation induced an increase in the levels released by the chondrocyte of MMP-1 and MMP-13 proteins, which are involved in ECM degradation. In comparison with the other Nox isoforms, Nox4 remains unusual, since it is constitutively active, does not depend on cytosolic activator proteins and seems to generate H2O2 thanks to the specific conformation of the Nox4 E-loop. Nox4-induced ROS production appears an essential actor in the OA process and it could be relevant to focus on this target in the aim of discovering and developing new therapeutic strategies.",

     "abstract": "Low-grade inflammation is associated with several deleterious health outcomes and may aggravate sarcopenia and dynapenia during aging. A strategy to alleviate these conditions is resistance training (RT). Thus, the aim was to critically examine the effects of regular RT on inflammatory markers of older adults from previous studies.The search was conducted on MEDLINE, July 2017. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing RT effects on C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and/or interleukin-6 (IL-6) of adults over 50\u202fyears-of-age were selected by two independent reviewers.The main meta-analyses showed RT reduced CRP in older adults (standard mean difference [SMD]\u202f=\u202f\u22120.61, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f\u22120.83; \u22120.31, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), tended to reduce IL-6 (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.19, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f\u22120.42; 0.02, p\u202f=\u202f0.07) and did not change TNF-\u03b1. Further exploratory sub-group analyses showed a potential association of muscle mass for both CRP and TNF-\u03b1 changes. Reductions in CRP and TNF-\u03b1 only occurred in RCTs performing a higher number of exercises (>8), higher weekly frequency (3\u202ftimes/week) and longer durations than 12\u202fweeks.Anti-inflammatory effects of RT were significant only for CRP with a tendency for a decrease in IL-6 as well. The exploratory analyses suggested the reduction in inflammatory markers could be dependent on increases in muscle mass and higher volume of RT protocols. These potential mediators of RT anti-inflammatory effects should be addressed in future meta-analyses to clarify the effects of RT on inflammatory markers of older adults with very specific conditions and larger numbers of studies.",

     "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by the decline in immune function, resulting in increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases and tumorigenesis. In our previous reports, we showed that Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strain Plasma (LC-Plasma) stimulated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which play an important role in viral infection, and oral administration of LC-Plasma showed prophylactic effects against viral infection both in mice and humans. However, the effects of long-term administration of LC-Plasma are not known. In this study, we investigated the effect of long-term oral administration of LC-Plasma on IFN-\u03b1 induction activity and individual senescence in the senescence-accelerated mice strains Prone 1 (SAMP1) and Prone 10 (SAMP10). LC-Plasma administration promoted IFN-\u03b1 induction activity and increased the na\u00efve T cell ratio in SAMP1 mice. In SAMP10 mice, in addition to preventing a decrease in the na\u00efve T cell ratio, aging-associated skin thinning was suppressed histologically and the expression of representative tight junction genes, such as Claudin-1 and Zo-1, was increased. Furthermore, age-related muscle weight loss tended to be suppressed in the LC-Plasma group and expression of the muscle degeneration gene FoxO-1 was significantly suppressed. Related to these phenotypes, the senescence score in the LC-Plasma group was significantly decreased at 47\u202fweeks of age compared with that in the control group. Taken together, long-term oral administration of LC-Plasma could prevent immune-senescence and other senescence phenotypes at the organ level. Therefore, LC-Plasma is suggested to be a useful functional food material for decelerating individual senescence.",

     "abstract": "This study aims to identify a genetic predisposition score from a set of candidate gene variants that predicts the response to a one-year exercise intervention. 200 participants (aged 60\u201383\u202fyears) were randomly assigned to a fitness (FIT), whole-body vibration (WBV) and control group. Participants in the exercise (FIT and WBV) groups performed a one-year intervention program. Whole-body skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and isometric knee extension strength (PTIM60) were measured before and after the intervention. A set of 170 muscle-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. Stepwise regression analysis was applied to select significantly contributing SNPs for baseline and relative change parameters. A data-driven genetic predisposition score (GPS) was calculated by adding up predisposing alleles for each of the phenotypes. GPS was calculated based on 4 to 8 SNPs which were significantly related to the corresponding phenotypes. These SNPs belong to genes that are involved in myoblast differentiation, muscle and bone growth, myofiber contraction, cytokines and DNA methylation. GPS was related to baseline PTIM60 and relative changes of SMM and PTIM60 in the exercise groups, explaining the variance of the corresponding parameter by 3.2%, 14% and 27%, respectively. Adding one increasing allele in the GPS increased baseline PTIM60 by 4.73\u202fNm, and exercise-induced relative changes of SMM and PTIM60 by 1.78% and 3.86% respectively. The identified genetic predisposition scores were positively related to baseline knee extension strength and muscle adaptations to exercise in healthy elderly. These findings provide supportive genetic explanations for high and low responders in exercise-induced muscle adaptations.",

     "abstract": "Arterial stiffness increases with advancing age, and is as an emerging biomarker in the assessment of vascular health. Some studies suggest that high-intensity resistance training increases arterial stiffness, but low- to moderate-intensity resistance training does not effect on arterial stiffening. Current evidence suggests that performing aerobic exercise after resistance training improved arterial stiffness in the young men and women. However, few studies have been conducted on the effects of the order of combined training on arterial stiffness in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of exercise order of combined aerobic and resistance training into the same session on body composition, muscle strength and arterial stiffness in older men. Forty-five older men (aged 70.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.5\u202fyears) were randomly assigned to 3 groups; AR: aerobic before resistance training, RA: resistance before aerobic training and CON: no training. Subjects trained 2 times per week for 10\u202fweeks. Resistance training consisted of 3 sets of 8\u201312 repetitions for 5 different exercises, 70\u201380% of one repetition maximum (1RM). Aerobic exercise consisted of cycling at 60% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Significant interaction effects were observed in waist circumference (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), grip strength (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), 10-m walk speed (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 1RM strength (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). However, no significant differences were observed between AR and RA. In contrast, pulse wave velocity (PWV) significantly reduced in the RA (9.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6\u202fm/s to 8.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6\u202fm/s, P\u202f<\u202f0.05), whereas, it did not change in the AR, and there was a significant group difference (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). In conclusion, no effects of the exercise order were observed in body composition, physical fitness and muscle strength. However, aerobic exercise after high-intensity resistance training reduced arterial stiffness and difference of exercise order was observed. We suggest that the exercise order may favorably affect arterial stiffness when combined aerobic exercise and high-intensity resistance training is performed into the same session.",

     "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading killer due to a single infectious disease worldwide. With the aging of the global population, the case rate and deaths due to TB are highest in the elderly population. While general immunosenescence associated with old age is thought to contribute to the susceptibility of the elderly to develop active TB disease, very few studies of immune function in elderly individuals with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection or disease have been performed. In particular, impaired adaptive T cell immunity to M.tb is one proposed mechanism for the elderly's increased susceptibility primarily on the basis of the decreased delayed type hypersensitivity response to tuberculin-purified protein derivative in the skin of elderly individuals. To investigate immunological reasons why the elderly are susceptible to develop active TB disease, we performed a cross-sectional observational study over a five year period (2012\u20132016) enrolling participants from 2 age groups (adults: 25\u201344\u202fyears; elderly: 65 and older) and 3 M.tb infection statuses (active TB, latent TB infection, and healthy controls without history of M.tb infection). We hypothesized that impaired peripheral T cell immunity plays a role in the biological susceptibility of the elderly to TB. Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed no evidence of impaired M.tb specific T cell frequency or altered production of cytokines implicated in M.tb control (IFN-\u03b3, IL-10) in peripheral blood in the elderly. Instead, we observed alterations in monocyte proportion and phenotype with age and M.tb infection that suggest their potential role in the susceptibility of the elderly to develop active TB. Our results suggest a potential link between the known widespread low-grade systemic inflammation of old age, termed \u201cinflammaging,\u201d with the elderly's specific susceptibility to developing active TB. Moreover, our results highlight the need for further research into the biological reasons why the elderly are more susceptible to disease and death from TB, so that public health systems can be better equipped to face the present and future problem of TB in an aging global population.",

     "abstract": "Evidence from upper-extremity literature suggests that the normal ageing process affects an individual's ability to learn and retain a motor skill, but spares their ability to transfer the skill to the untrained, opposite limb. While this phenomenon has been well-studied in the upper-extremity, evidence in the lower-extremity is limited. Further, it is unclear to what extent age-related differences in motor learning and transfer are dependent on visual feedback of the motor task. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ageing on motor learning, retention, and interlimb transfer during walking with and without visual feedback. Forty-four subjects (24 young; 20 older adults) were tested on a treadmill over two consecutive days. On day 1, subjects learned a new gait pattern by performing a foot-trajectory tracking task that necessitated greater hip and knee flexion during the swing phase of the gait. On day 2, subjects repeated the task with their training leg to test retention, then with their untrained leg to test interlimb transfer. Trials without visual feedback were also collected on both days. Results indicated that older adults had reduced ability to learn the task, and also exhibited lower retention and inter-limb transfer. However, these differences were dependent on visual feedback as the groups performed similarly when feedback was removed. The findings provide novel evidence indicating that ageing impairs learning, retention, and transfer of motor skills in the lower-extremity during walking, which may have implications for gait therapy after stroke and other geriatric conditions.",

     "abstract": "Decrease in multiple functions occurs in the brain with aging, all of which can contribute to age-related cognitive and locomotor impairments. Brain atrophy specifically in hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and striatum, can contribute to this age-associated decline in function. Our recent metabolomics analysis showed age-related changes in these brain regions. To further understand the aging processes, analysis using a proteomics approach was carried out. This study was conducted to identify proteome profiles in the hippocampus, mPFC, and striatum of 14-, 18-, 23-, and 27-month-old rats. Proteomics analysis using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometry identified 1074 proteins in the hippocampus, 871 proteins in the mPFC, and 241 proteins in the striatum. Of these proteins, 97 in the hippocampus, 25 in mPFC, and 5 in striatum were differentially expressed with age. The altered proteins were classified into three ontologies (cellular component, molecular function, and biological process) containing 44, 38, and 35 functional groups in the hippocampus, mPFC, and striatum, respectively. Most of these altered proteins participate in oxidative phosphorylation (e.g. cytochrome c oxidase and ATP synthase), glutathione metabolism (e.g. peroxiredoxins), or calcium signaling pathway (e.g. protein S100B and calmodulin). The most prominent changes were observed in the oldest animals. These results suggest that alterations in oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione metabolism, and calcium signaling pathway are involved in cognitive and locomotor impairments in aging.",

Fatigue resistance (FR, time for maximal grip strength to decrease to 50% during sustained contraction) was measured with both Martin Vigorimeter and Jamar Dynamometer, and grip work (GW, reflecting the area under the time-force curve) was calculated.FR, when measured with the Martin Vigorimeter, was approximately double in low-frail (44.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f24.6\u202fs) compared to high-frail participants (23.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.7\u202fs, p\u202f=\u202f0.011), whereas FR was similar across frailty groups when measured with the Jamar Dynamometer. In logistic regression models, FR (OR\u202f=\u202f0.94 [0.90\u20130.99]) and GW (OR\u202f=\u202f0.90 [0.82\u20130.99]) were significantly related to high frailty when measured with the Martin Vigorimeter but not when measured with Jamar Dynamometer. There is a significantly proportional difference in FR measured with both devices (R2\u202f=\u202f0.364, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), highlighting that the longer the participant could sustain the FR test, the higher the difference in FR measured with both devices.Our results suggest that the Martin Vigorimeter is a more appropriate handgrip device compared with the Jamar Dynamometer to assess muscle fatigability for older women across levels of frailty. When measured with the Martin Vigorimeter, high-frail participants show twice the level of fatigability compared to low-frail, whereas no difference was observed when using the Jamar Dynamometer. Older participants might stop the FR test prematurely when using the Jamar Dynamometer, before muscle fatigue is reached, indicating that the Jamar Dynamometer is unable to identify those participants with higher levels of muscle endurance. Martin Vigorimeter assessed muscle fatigability might be a good additional marker to include in frailty tools.",

     "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PD) can be classified into tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes; the latter group having more impaired gait and increased fall risk. While there is some evidence that anti-parkinsonian medication, levodopa, might not improve balance and gait control or reduce fall risk in the PIGD subtype, it is unclear whether the levodopa dosage intake affects gait stability. To address these issues, this study used accelerometry to compare gait stability: (i) during before and after levodopa intake between non-PIGD and PIGD subtypes; (ii) between individuals who took less or >750\u202fmg of levodopa/day.In 15 non-PIGD (Combination of 13 TD patients and 2 classified as indeterminate subtype) and 23 PIGD participants of similar mean (SD) age ((63.0 (7.6) versus 62.6 (10.0) years, respectively)) and disease-duration (8.9 (8.9) versus 11.3 (4.6) years, respectively), head and trunk stability during gait was examined using anteroposterior, vertical and mediolateral acceleration harmonic ratios (HRs). Participants were assessed before and after a levodopa dose, during typical \u201coff\u201d and \u201con\u201d periods, respectively.Two-way analyses of variance (group\u202f\u00d7\u202fmedication status) revealed that compared to the non-PIGD subgroup, the PIGD subgroup showed significantly worse head stability (lower anteroposterior HR) in the \u201coff\u201d state, and significantly worse pelvis stability (significantly lower mediolateral and vertical HRs) in the \u201con\u201d state (p\u202f<\u202f0.05 for both). Levodopa was effective in treating most of the disease-related impairments (not bradykinesia) in both groups, (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) but improved gait stability (lowered pelvis mediolateral and vertical HRs) only in people with the non-PIGD subtype (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and those taking <750\u202fmg of levodopa/day (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).People with the PD PIGD subtype exhibit impaired gait stability that is not improved and frequently worsened by levodopa. New non-pharmaceutical approaches, technological (e.g. cueing) or exercise-based (e.g. balance training) are required to improve or compensate for mediolateral gait instability in this subtype and ultimately prevent falls.",

Female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups, included young-control group, young-MPTP group, aged-control group and aged-MPTP group. Pole test and adhesive removal test were firstly performed. ELISA assay was used to detect the content of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in brain tissue. Then we tested the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), p-nuclear transcription factor (NF-\u03baB), toll-like receptor2 (TLR2), arginase-1 (arg-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. Our results showed that aging promoted M1 microglia activation and inhibited M2 microglia activation in SN in MPTP-PD model, accompanied by the elevation of proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2). Consequently, aging significantly aggravated motor dysfunction and dopaminergic neuron loss in SN. Besides, compared with young-MPTP group, the protein expression of TLR2 and p-NF-\u03baB-p65 increased obviously in aged-MPTP group. The results revealed that aging aggravated inflammatory response by modulated microglia phenotypes transition in SN in PD, and contributed to further understand the pathogenesis of PD.",

Boerhaavia diffusa L. (Nyctaginaceae) derived novel molecule Boeravinone B (BOB) possesses a variety of pharmacological activities, yet their anti-aging potential has not been explored. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism of BOB mediated oxidative stress resistance and lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans. The results showed that the BOB significantly extends the lifespan of C. elegans with its anti-oxidative potential via reducing accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). BOB was found to recover the shortened lifespan of oxidative stress prone mutants mev-1 and gas-1 (14.75 and 16.11%, respectively). Additionally, this finding supported by the reduced ROS levels seen in BOB treated worms. Further, the effective concentration of BOB (25\u202f\u03bcM) significantly enhanced the expressions of target genes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD-3), glutathione-S-transferase (GST-4) and heat shock protein (HSP-16.2) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), and it does so by modulating the stress-related signaling pathways (SEK-1) and transcription factors (SKN-1/Nrf and DAF-16/Foxo). Moreover, BOB exposure (25\u202f\u03bcM) caused significant changes of age-dependent biomarkers such as pharyngeal pumping, body bend, locomotor activity and lipofuscin accumulation were also showed that BOB retards the aging. Overall, the findings highlight the antioxidant supplement triggering pharmaceutical potential of BOB which may serve as a new future perspective for healthy aging or delayed onset of oxidative related diseases.",

Caprylidene has been shown to improve cognition in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) who lacked an AD-predisposing allele (\u025b4) of the gene for apolipoprotein E. In this pilot study, we examined the effects of caprylidene on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with mild to moderate AD.Sixteen subjects with mild-to-moderate AD, based on NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, were enrolled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.

Subjects received 4 15O-water PET scans over the course of the study to assess rCBF: once before receiving a standard caprylidene or placebo dose and 90\u202fmin after the dose, on the first day and after 45\u202fdays of daily caprylidene or placebo consumption. The scans were examined by standardized volumes of interest (sVOI) and voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (spm) methods of analysis.Subjects lacking an \u025b4 allele had significantly elevated rCBF in the left superior lateral temporal cortex by sVOI analysis after adopting a caprylidene diet for 45\u202fdays (p\u202f=\u202f0.04), which was further corroborated by spm. The anterior cerebellum, left inferior temporal cortex, and hypothalamus were also found by spm to be regions of long-term increase in rCBF in these subjects. In contrast, patients who possessed the \u025b4 allele did not display these changes in rCBF.Daily ingestion of caprylidene over 45\u202fdays was associated with increased blood flow in specific brain regions in patients lacking an apolipoprotein \u025b4 allele.",

Recent evidence suggests that increasing the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 [ACE2]/angiotensin-(1-7)[Ang-(1-7)]/Mas receptor (MasR) axis in obese animal models leads to significant reductions in body weight. It was hypothesized that activation of ACE2 via diminazene aceturate (DIZE) will significantly reduce body weight of rats fed a high fat diet. Young and old (4 and 23\u202fmonths, respectively) male Fisher 344\u202f\u00d7\u202fBrown Norway rats were fed 60% high fat diet for one week, and subsequently given either 15\u202fmg/kg/day DIZE s.c. or vehicle for three weeks. DIZE treatment resulted in a significant reduction of food intake and body weight in both young and old animals. However, that decrease was so dramatic in the older animals that they all nearly stopped eating. Interestingly, the TD-NMR assessments revealed that the weight-loss was primarily a result of decreased body fat percentage, with a relative preservation of lean mass. Tissue weights confirm the significant loss of white adipose tissue (WAT), with no change in muscle weights. Gene expression and serum ACE2 activity analyses implied that increased activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis plays a role in reducing fat mass. Collectively, our results suggest that DIZE may be a useful tool in the study of obesity; however, caution is recommended when using this compound in older animals due to severe anorectic effects, although there is a mechanism by which muscle is preserved.",

The interaction between these pathways during aging as well as the similarity between such changes in human and mouse skeletal muscle is however not fully understood. Therefore the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that cellular degradation pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy and mitophagy are coordinately regulated in mouse and human skeletal muscle during aging and lifelong exercise training through a PGC-1\u03b1-p53 axis. Muscle samples were obtained from young untrained, aged untrained and aged lifelong exercise trained men, and from whole-body PGC-1\u03b1 knockout mice and their littermate controls that were either lifelong exercise trained or sedentary young and aged. Lifelong exercise training prevented the aging-induced reduction in PGC-1\u03b1, p53 and p21 mRNA as well as the increase in LC3II and BNIP3 protein in mouse skeletal muscle, while aging decreased the BAX/Bcl-2 ratio, LC3I and BAX protein in mouse skeletal muscle without effects of lifelong exercise training. In humans, aging was associated with reduced PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA as well as decreased p62 and p21 protein in skeletal muscle, while lifelong exercise training increased BNIP3 protein and decreased p53 mRNA. In conclusion, there was a divergent regulation of autophagy and apoptosis in mouse muscle with aging and lifelong exercise training, whereas healthy aged human skeletal muscle seemed rather robust to changes in apoptosis, autophagy and mitophagy markers compared with mouse muscle at the investigated age.",

Maximal strength training (MST) appears to be a practical and effective intervention to increase both exercise capacity and efficiency. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for these functional improvements are still unclear. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine the intramuscular and metabolic adaptations induced by 8\u202fweeks of knee-extension MST in the quadriceps of 10 older individuals (75\u202f\u00b1\u202f9\u202fyrs) by employing a combination of molecular, magnetic resonance 1H-imaging and 31P-spectroscopy, muscle biopsies, motor nerve stimulation, and indirect calorimetry techniques. Dynamic and isometric muscle strength were both significantly increased by MST. The greater torque-time integral during sustained isometric maximal contraction post-MST (P\u202f=\u202f0.002) was associated with increased rates of ATP synthesis from anaerobic glycolysis (PRE: 10\u202f\u00b1\u202f7\u202fmM\u00b7min\u22121; POST: 14\u202f\u00b1\u202f7\u202fmM\u00b7min\u22121, P\u202f=\u202f0.02) and creatine kinase reaction (PRE: 31\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fmM\u00b7min\u22121; POST: 41\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fmM\u00b7min\u22121, P\u202f=\u202f0.006) such that the ATP cost of contraction was not significantly altered. Expression of fast myosin heavy chain, quadriceps muscle volume, and submaximal cycling net efficiency were also increased with MST (P\u202f=\u202f0.005; P\u202f=\u202f0.03 and P\u202f=\u202f0.03, respectively). Overall, MST induced a shift toward a more glycolytic muscle phenotype allowing for greater muscle force production during sustained maximal contraction. Consequently, some of the MST-induced improvements in exercise tolerance might stem from a greater anaerobic capacity to generate ATP, while the improvement in exercise efficiency appears to be independent from an alteration in the ATP cost of contraction.",

     "abstract": "Sirtuins have gained considerable attention as epigenetic regulators for slowing aging and age-related disorders. The growing association between neurodegeneration and inflammation has led researchers to investigate interactions of sirtuins with inflammatory markers in neurodegenerative diseases. We analyzed SIRT1's association with chronic inflammation in dementia as an age-related neurodegenerative condition through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and interleukin-7 (IL7) for the first time. In the present study, we observed a significant increase in the level of SIRT1 in patients with all types of dementia. Interestingly, the level of TLR4 protein was significantly lower in only the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to the healthy elderly subjects. There was no significant change in the level of IL7 between the diseased and healthy elderly subjects. A significant positive correlation between SIRT1 level and age in healthy elderly subjects was evident according to Pearson's correlation test. However, this correlation was not observed in the dementia patients. Furthermore, the positive correlation between the levels of IL7 and TLR4 in the healthy elderly subjects was absent in the dementia patients. However, there was no direct association between the examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and dementia at the molecular level. According to logistic regression analysis, dementia risk increases 1.16 times due to an increase in the SIRT1 level and 24.23 times due to a decrease in the TLR4 level. Interestingly, a high level in the total antioxidant status (TAS) increases the risk of dementia approximately 33.32 times. Therefore, the current study, for the first time, provides a much better molecular understanding of the interaction between decreasing TLR4 levels and increasing SIRT1 levels in dementia, especially in AD. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of epigenetics in several age-related diseases and suggests that developing novel therapies to prevent or slow down the progression of dementia may support healthy aging.",

The present study analyzes levels of protein adduction by lipid peroxidation (LP) end-products neuroketal (NKT) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as markers of protein oxidative damage, cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels, as a marker of inflammation, and cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2), responsible of generation of neuroprotective products, in twelve brain regions in normal middle-aged individuals (MA) and old-aged (OA) individuals. In addition, levels of these markers were evaluated as a function of age as a continuous variable and correction for multiple comparisons. Selection of regions was based on their different vulnerability to prevalent neurodegenerative diseases in aging. Our findings show region-dependent LP end-products, COX-2 and CYP2J2 changes in the aging human brain. However, no clear relationship can be established between NKT, MDA, COX-2 and CYP2J2 levels, and regional vulnerability to neurodegeneration in old age.",

The PFP was defined according to Fried's criteria and its components were reassessed at two-year follow-up.LTL was neither associated with the PFP at baseline by Spearman rank correlation tests, nor did it predict change in frailty parameters over a two-year follow-up using regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders.LTL is not associated with frailty; neither in non-depressed nor in depressed older persons. As LTL and physical frailty appear to represent different aspects of ageing, they may complement each other in future studies.",

     "abstract": "It is well-known that as humans age they experience significant changes in gait including reduction in velocity and ground reaction forces and changes in leg mechanics. Progressive changes in gait can lead to disability and frailty, defined as an inability to carry out activities of daily living. This topic is relevant to basic understanding of the aging process and for clinical intervention. As such, studies of frailty can benefit from nonhuman animal models, yet little is known about gait frailty in nonhuman primates. This study examines a nonhuman primate model to evaluate its relevance to understanding human aging processes. To test the null hypothesis that age-related changes in joint function and gait do occur in primate models in a similar fashion to humans, a detailed gait analysis, including velocity, footfall timings, and vertical ground reaction forces, on bipedal locomotion was performed in Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli), ranging in age from 5\u202fyears to 24\u202fyears. None of the spatiotemporal or kinetic gait variables measured was significantly correlated with age alone. There was a slight but significant reduction in locomotor velocity when animals were grouped into \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201cold\u201d categories. These data show that aging P. coquereli experience only subtle age-related changes, that were not nearly as extensive as reported in humans. This lack of change suggests that unlike humans, lemurs maintain gait competency at high levels, possibly because these animals maintain reproductive capacity close to their age of death and that frailty may be selected against, since gait disability would result in injury and death that would preclude independent living. Although nonhuman primates should experience age-related senescence, their locomotor performance should remain robust throughout their lifetimes, which raises questions about the use of primate models of gait disability, an area that deserves further investigation.",

     "abstract": "Contusion injury in aging muscle has not been studied in detail, but older adults are at risk for such injuries due to increased risk of falls. As falls in older populations are unlikely to be eliminated, interventions to minimize the negative impact of falls, including contusion injury should be pursued. Dietary fish oil (FO) is a common often supplement in older adults, which is associated with factors that might reduce or worsen the negative impact of contusion.Here, we investigate whether 8\u202fweeks of FO can blunt the impact of contusion injury in adult (n\u202f=\u202f14) and aged (n\u202f=\u202f12) rats. We assessed contractility and several biochemical markers in adult and aged gastrocnemius muscles 48\u202fh post-contusion injury, using the uninjured muscles as controls.Injury reduced force production ~40% (P\u202f<\u202f0.001), sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release by ~20% (P\u202f=\u202f0.003) and significantly increased several markers of muscle damage (i.e., protein carbonyls, Grp78 abundance (P\u202f=\u202f0.022, 0.006, respectively)), and these injury-related changes were not affected by aging. The effects of FO were limited. A main effect (P\u202f=\u202f0.018) for FO to increase the myogenic factor Myf5 was observed. In addition FO reduced the injury-associated decline in the mitophagy factor DRP1 (P\u202f=\u202f0.027).Although age-related differences in certain protein markers differed, aged muscles exhibited no greater acute functional deficits following injury. Similarly, while FO did not reduce functional deficits, it did not worsen them. However, changes in Myf5 and DRP1 with dietary FO suggest the potential to improve recovery from contusion injury, which should be investigated in future studies.",

Seventy-eight right-handed, healthy older adults between 60 and 88\u202fyears were assigned to a Young-Old (<70\u202fyears) or an Old-Old (>71\u202fyears) group. Cognitive assessment and pure tone audiometry were conducted. Spatiotemporal parameters of gait quantified by mean (M), and coefficient of variations (CoV) were evaluated with the OptoGait system during 3 dichotic listening conditions: Non-Forced, Forced-Right and Forced-Left. Factorial analyses of variance and covariance were used to assess group differences and the moderating effects of hearing status, respectively. Results demonstrated that three of the gait parameters assessed were affected asymmetrically by the dual-task paradigm after controlling for hearing status. Asymmetries existed on step width, gait speed and variability of stride length. Finally, correlations between gait outcomes and dichotic listening results showed that M and CoVs in gait parameters during right-ear responses were longer compared with left-ear. Left-ear responses were related to increased variability on stride length, which indicates higher difficulty level. Hearing status varying from normal to mild levels of hearing loss modulates spatiotemporal gait outcomes measured during dichotic listening execution. Findings suggest that attending to left side stimuli relates to increased gait variability, while focusing on right-side assures a safe walk. Results demonstrated that attending to right-ear stimuli is an adaptive strategy for older adults that compensates for limited sensorimotor and cognitive resources during walking.",

     "abstract": "Despite the considerable amount of data available on the effect of donor age upon the outcomes of organ transplantation, these still represent an underutilized resource in aging research. In this review, we have compiled relevant studies that analyze the effect of donor age in graft and patient survival following liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, lung and cornea transplantation, with the aim of deriving insights into possible differential aging rates between the different organs. Overall, older donor age is associated with worse outcomes for all the organs studied. Nonetheless, the donor age from which the negative effects upon graft or patient survival starts to be significant varies between organs. In kidney transplantation, this age is within the third decade of life while the data for heart transplantation suggest a significant effect starting from donors over age 40. This threshold was less defined in liver transplantation where it ranges between 30 and 50\u202fyears. The results for the pancreas are also suggestive of a detrimental effect starting at a donor age of around 40, although these are mainly derived from simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation data. In lung transplantation, a clear effect was only seen for donors over 65, with negative effects of donor age upon transplantation outcomes likely beginning after age 50. Corneal transplants appear to be less affected by donor age as the majority of studies were unable to find any effect of donor age during the first few years posttransplantation. Overall, patterns of the effect of donor age in patient and graft survival were observed for several organ types and placed in the context of knowledge on aging.",

Electromyography (EMG) of the rectus femoris (RF), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) were measured using wireless surface sensors. Root mean square (RMS) and within-cycle coefficient of variation (CV) values were calculated for several phases of gait.

These influences may help explain overall increased instability and fall risk in older adults.",

Sestrin1, 2, 3 are multifunctional proteins that regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC1), autophagy and redox homeostasis. It is unclear how aging affects Sestrins and their downstream targets in human, therefore this study examined the basal expression of Sestrins in three age groups, young, middle-aged and older men and explored the mTORC1 pathway, autophagy markers and antioxidant regulation. Older men had less Sestrin1 and 3 protein and a different pattern of Sestrin2 electrophoretic mobility. The mRNA expression of SESN1 was upregulated in older men, but the discrepancy was not by microRNA expression. Although protein expressions of Sestrins were downregulated with aging, phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK\u03b1Thr172) and read-outs of mTORC1 activation, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1Thr421/Ser424) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) mobility shift were unaltered. However, total p70S6K1 and 4E-BP1 were reduced in middle-aged and older men. The mRNA expressions of autophagic markers including microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) were upregulated in middle-aged and older men. Although nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) was upregulated in older men, the protein and mRNA expressions of its downstream antioxidants were either increased, decreased or unaltered. No clear relationship was observed between Sestrins and their downstream targets, yet it can be concluded that Sestrins proteins are clearly downregulated with aging.",

Neurotrophic factor changes and oxidative stress could subserve these phenomena. Aging-related brain changes can be well monitored through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The objective was to analyze neurotrophic and oxidative parameters that could be related to midbrain dopamine neuronal loss or brain inflammation in the CSF of elderly subjects: 1) levels of the dopaminotrophic factors BDNF, GDNF, persephin, and neurturin, 2) levels of the proinflammatory factors TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b22; 3) activity of main antioxidant enzymes (catalases, glutathione-peroxidase, glutathione-reductase, glutathione-S-transferases, peroxirredoxins, and superoxide-dismutases), 4) ferritin content, antioxidant protein which reduces reactive free iron, and 5) antioxidant potential of the cerebrospinal fluid. ELISA and PAO tests were used. Subjects were also evaluated clinically, and the group of old subjects with mild cognitive impairment was studied separately. The findings indicate that normal elderly CSF is devoid of changes in either dopaminotrophic or proinflammatory factors. The antioxidant efficacy is slightly reduced with normal aging, through a reduction of glutathione-S-transferase activity in people older than 74\u202fyears (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). However old people with mild cognitive impairment show reduced BDNF levels, and stronger signs of oxidative stress such as low antioxidant potential and glutathione-S-transferase activity (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). To sum up, the present study demonstrates that, in CSF of normal senescence, dopaminotrophic factors and proinflammatory TGF-family ligands are not affected, and antioxidant efficacy is slightly reduced. CSF of elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment shows more oxidative and trophic changes that are characterized by reduction of BDNF content, glutathione-S-transferase activity, and antioxidant potential.",

     "abstract": "As the number of older adults increases, so does the number of frail older adults. Although anthropometry has been widely used as a way to stratify the overall mortality risk of a person, the significance of these measurements becomes blurred in the case of frail older adults who have changes in body composition. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the association of anthropometric measurements (body mass index, knee-adjusted height body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and calf circumference) with mortality risk in a group of older Mexican adults.This is a longitudinal analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging sub-sample (with biomarkers, n\u202f=\u202f2573) from the first wave in 2001, followed-up to the last available wave in 2015. Only frail 50-year or older adults (Frailty Index with a cut-off value of 0.21 or higher, was used) were considered for this analysis (n\u202f=\u202f1298). A survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models (unadjusted and adjusted for confounding). Socio-demographic, health risks, physical activity and comorbidities were variables used for adjusting the multivariate models.From the total sample of 1298 older adults, 32.5% (n\u202f=\u202f422) died during follow-up. The highest hazard ratio in the adjusted model was for calf circumference 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.02\u20131.69, p\u202f=\u202f0.034). Other measurements were not significant.Anthropometric measurements have different significance in frail older adults, and these differences could have implications on adverse outcomes. Calf circumference has a potential value in predicting negative health outcomes.",

In Europe, depression is one of the most frequent mental disorders across all age groups, but particularly in people aged 65\u202fyears and over, and higher depressive symptoms have been reported among individuals with chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and heart disease).To evaluate the role of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) in depression in a sample of older people living in the Mediterranean basin.Standard procedures were used to determine socio-demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics of the participants, as well as their dietary habits, and depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Multi-adjusted logistic and linear regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the associations between participants' characteristics and depression.Participants classified as having mild or severe depression were less educated and physically active, and more diabetic, and they reported less adherence to the MedDiet. Adherence to the MedDiet was associated with the absence of depression [(OR, 95% CI): 0.65, 0.50\u22120.85]. In addition, daily tea drinking was also related to the absence of depression [(OR, 95% CI): 0.51, 0.40\u22120.65].Greater adherence to the MedDiet and daily tea drinking seem to have a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms in older adults.",

     "abstract": "Immunosenescence has been described as age-associated changes in the immune function which are thought to be responsible for the increased morbidity with age. Human Natural Killer (NK) cells are a specialized heterogeneous subpopulation of lymphocytes involved in immune defense against tumor and microbial diseases. Interestingly, aging-related NK cell dysfunction is associated with features of aging such as tumor incidence, reduced vaccination efficacy, and short survival due to infection. It is known that NK cell effector functions are critically dependent on cytokines and metabolic activity. Our aim was to determine whether there is a difference in purified human NK cell function in response to high concentration of IL-2 between young and elder donors. Here, we report that the stimulation of human NK cells with IL-2 (2000\u202fU/mL) enhance NK cell cytotoxic activity from both young and elderly donors. However, while NK cells from young people responded to IL-2 signaling by increasing mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential, no increase in these mitochondrial functional parameters was seen in purified NK cells from elderly subjects. Moreover, as purified NK cells from the young exhibited an almost three-fold increase in PGC-1\u03b1 expression after IL-2 (2000\u202fU/mL) stimulation, PGC-1\u03b1 expression was inhibited in purified NK cells from elders. Furthermore, this response upon PGC-1\u03b1 expression after IL-2 stimulation promoted an increase in ROS production in NK cells from elderly humans, while no increase in ROS production was observed in NK cells of young donors. Our data show that IL-2 stimulates NK cell effector function through a signaling pathway which involves a PGC-1\u03b1-dependent mitochondrial function in young NK cells, however it seems that NK cells from older donors exhibit an altered IL-2 signaling which affects mitochondrial function associated with an increased production of ROS which could represent a feature of NK cell senescence.",

Of these patients, 262 patients (male/female: 101/161) had received standard rehabilitation treatment. Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores were measured both at admission and discharge to calculate FIM gain and efficiency, and retrospective cohort study was performed.Cut-off point of BMI value to assess the geriatric status was determined (19.0\u202fkg/m2). Significant associations of low BMI to several geriatric factors such as loss of posterior occlusion, cognitive impairment were observed in both male and female. FIM scores in above cut-off point group were significantly higher than in below cut-off point group in female (FIM gain, P\u202f=\u202f0.0005; FIM efficiency, P\u202f=\u202f0.0025, Mann-Whitney U test). On the other hand, there were no significant differences between low and above BMI cut-off point in FIM scores of male patients.Low BMI might be a useful parameter to evaluate the geriatric status, and the viewpoint would contribute to decide the care plan for the good end-of-life of elderly.",

Wistar rats (12-mo of age) were divided in to two groups: S group (sedentary) and T group (trained). The exercise protocol were 16\u202fweeks long. The groups were sacrificed at 16\u202fmonths. Ultrafine sections of the femoral nerve have been used. There was no change in the body weight between the groups. T group showed a significant increase in myelinated fiber area, axon diameter, myelin sheath thickness and myelin fiber number compared with sedentary controls. In exercised trained animals, histograms of the frequency distribution of myelinated axons according to their areas showed increased number of medium and large fibers in relation to small fibers, which decreased in number. Aerobic training animals, showed the distribution of myelinated fiber population according to their area being bimodal, with the distribution shifted to the right, indicating increased fiber area. The T group showed a percent damage of large myelinated fibers significantly lower compared to controls. No significant difference was observed between the groups for the g-ratio. The T group also showed a significant increase in the number of microtubules and neurofilaments in myelinated fibers, which was not observed in S group. In conclusion, aerobic training improves nerve structure without evidence of nerve damage and produces an attenuation on the modifications in femoral nerve that develop in old age.",

     "abstract": "Rapid muscle characteristics, such as the rate of power development (RPD), are shown to decline more than maximal muscle characteristics during ageing in single-joint actions. However, functional disability is mainly the result of multi-joint lower limb failure. The complex activation patterns inherent to multi-joint actions and the deteriorating effect of age on that neural drive suggest a larger effect of age on RPD multi-joint. Yet, this is the first study that compared multi- with single-joint leg extension tests in terms of RPD across the adult life span and assessed its transferability to functional performance.96 healthy adults (\u2642 49, \u2640 47, age\u202f=\u202f20\u201369\u202fyears) performed dynamic single-joint knee-extension tests on a Biodex System 3 dynamometer and multi-joint leg-extension tests on a custom-made device at low, moderate and high speed. Peak power (Ppeak) was calculated as the highest value of the power-time curve and RPD as the linear slope till isokinetic speed was reached. Functional performance was tested using squat jump height.RPD showed greater age-related declines in multi-joint (\u22121.92%/year) versus single-joint (\u22121.42%/year) actions, which is in contrast with the finding of Ppeak (\u22120.77% vs. \u20131.04%/year). Squat jump height was more strongly associated with RPD multi-joint than single-joint (r\u202f=\u202f0.77\u20130.82 vs. 0.44\u20130.61).These results show greater age-related declines of RPD multi-joint versus single-joint and demonstrate its functional relevance. We believe that this finding may be of high importance for the detection and prevention of functional disability during ageing.",

     "abstract": "Although age-related declines in cognitive, sensory and motor capacities are well documented, current evidence is mixed as to whether or not aging impairs sensorimotor adaptation to a novel dynamic environment. More importantly, the extent to which any deficits in sensorimotor adaptation are due to general impairments in neural plasticity, or impairments in the specific processes that drive adaptation is unclear. Here we investigated whether there are age-related differences in electrophysiological responses to reaching endpoint and trajectory errors caused by a novel force field, and whether markers of error processing relate to the ability of older adults to adapt their movements. Older and young adults (N\u202f=\u202f24/group, both sexes) performed 600 reaches to visual targets, and received audio-visual feedback about task success or failure after each trial. A velocity-dependent curl field pushed the hand to one side during each reach. We extracted ERPs time-locked to movement onset [kinematic error-related negativity (kERN)], and the presentation of success/failure feedback [feedback error-related negativity (fERN)]. At a group level, older adults did not differ from young adults in the rate or extent of sensorimotor adaptation, but EEG responses to both trajectory errors and task errors were reduced in the older group. Most interestingly, the amplitude of the kERN correlated with the rate and extent of sensorimotor adaptation in older adults. Thus, older adults with an impaired capacity for encoding kinematic trajectory errors also have compromised abilities to adapt their movements in a novel dynamic environment.",

The prevalence of disability in mid-life is relatively low and hence screening in this age group may present an opportunity for early identification of those at increased future risk who may benefit most from preventative interventions.Data were drawn from two waves of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development. We examined whether several chronic conditions, poor health behaviours and lower scores on three measures of physical performance (grip strength, chair rise speed and standing balance time) at age 53 were associated with self-reported mobility and/or personal care disability at age 69. We used the area under the curve statistic (AUC) to assess model discrimination.At age 69, 44% (826/1855) of participants reported mobility and/or personal care disability.Our final clinical prediction model included sex, knee osteoarthritis, taking 2+ medications, smoking, increased BMI and poor performance in all three physical tests, with an AUC of 0.740 compared with 0.708 for a model which did not include the performance measures.Measures of physical performance in midlife improve discrimination in clinical prediction models for disability over 16\u202fyears.

This can cause or exacerbate numerous pathologies to which the elderly are often more sensitive.In order to estimate the influence of age on the development of early cellular epigenetic alterations involved in carcinogenesis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells sampled from 90 patients from three age classes (25\u201330, 50\u201355 and 75\u201380\u202fyears old) were ex vivo exposed to urban PM2.5.Particles exposure led to variations in telomerase activity and telomeres length in all age groups without any influence of age. Conversely, P16INK4A gene expression increased significantly with age after exposure to PM2.5. Age could enhance MGMT gene expression after exposure to particles, by decreasing the level of promoter methylation in the oldest people.Hence, our results demonstrated several tendencies in cells modification depending on age, even if all epigenetic assays were carried out after a limited exposure time allowing only one or two cell cycles. Since lung cancer symptoms appear only at an advanced stage, our results underline the needs for further investigation on the studied biomarkers for early diagnosis of carcinogenesis to improve survival.",

Swallowing-related problems in elderly individuals can be prevented or their symptoms can be improved with strengthening exercises for the muscles involved in swallowing. The existing strengthening exercises for the suprahyoid muscle have their limitations. Therefore, it is necessary to find another exercise that can be performed by individuals whose personal characteristics make it difficult for them to perform the existing exercises. In this study, we investigated the changes in suprahyoid muscle activation, tongue strength, and thickness of the suprahyoid muscle after 8\u202fweeks of the head extension swallowing exercise (HESE). A total of 23 healthy elderly individuals participated in an 8-week exercise program (20\u202fmin/session, 2\u202ftimes/week for 8\u202fweeks). Suprahyoid muscle activation during effortful swallowing and the effortful-normal ratio were significantly increased at 8\u202fweeks compared to the baseline values (p\u202f=\u202f0.002, and 0.033, respectively). Tongue tip pressure, tongue base pressure, normal swallowing pressure, effortful swallowing pressure, and tongue tip endurance were significantly increased at 8\u202fweeks compared with baseline (p\u202f=\u202f0.014, 0.004, 0.046, 0.009, and 0.004, respectively). The thickness of the digastric muscle and that of the mylohyoid muscle were significantly increased at 8\u202fweeks compared with baseline (p\u202f=\u202f0.000 and 0.004, respectively). This study showed that HESE can be a good option for improving the suprahyoid muscle and tongue strength in the elderly population. Additionally, this exercise does not require any additional equipment and has the advantage of being able to be performed anytime and anywhere. A variety of exercise options tailored according to individual characteristics may be helpful in choosing the most appropriate exercise.",

MCI was a risk factor for dementia and SG increased the risk, even after adjusting for covariates (SG: HR\u202f=\u202f1.31 (0.81\u20132.14), 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.276, sMCI: HR\u202f=\u202f1.87, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.21\u20132.88, p\u202f=\u202f.005; mMCI: HR\u202f=\u202f3.36, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.98\u20135.71, p\u202f<\u202f.001; sMCI\u202f+\u202fSG: HR\u202f=\u202f3.33, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.92\u20135.77, p\u202f<\u202f.001; mMCI\u202f+\u202fSG: HR\u202f=\u202f5.02, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f2.75\u20139.14, p\u202f<\u202f.001).Co-occurrence of MCI and SG has a high risk of dementia compared to that of each condition alone. Evaluation of both gait and cognition is useful in risk assessment of dementia.",

     "abstract": "Ageing affects various physiological and metabolic processes in a body and a progressive accumulation of oxidative damage stands out as often used explanation. One of the most powerful scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in all organs is melatonin. A majority of melatonin supplied to the body via blood originates from the pineal gland. However, we have been interested in a locally produced melatonin.We have used 2.5- and 36-months-old Wistar rats. Tissues were collected and gene expression of AA-NAT and ASMT, the two key enzymes in a synthesis of melatonin, was determined in brain, liver, kidney, heart, skin, and intestine. Since melatonin can influence antioxidant enzymes, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the level of GSH were measured in liver. In addition, Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), and Manganese (Mn) were also determined in liver since these microelements might affect the activity of antioxidant enzymes.The expression of AA-NAT and ASMT was increased in liver and skin of old animals. A positive correlation in AA-NAT and ASMT expression was observed in liver, intestine and kidney. Moreover, the activity of CAT enzyme in liver was increased while SOD activity was decreased. SOD and CAT were probably affected by the observed decreased amount of Cu, Zn, and Mn in liver of old animals.In our model, extrapineal melatonin pathway in ageing consisted of complex interplay of locally produced melatonin, activities of SOD and CAT, and adequate presence of Cu, Zn and Mn microelements in order to defend organs against oxidative damage.",

     "abstract": "Holothuria scabra is a sea cucumber that is mostly found in the Indo-Pacific region including Thailand. Extracts from many sea cucumbers possess pharmacological activities proposed to benefit human health. In this study, we investigated the anti-oxidant and anti-ageing activities of extracts from H. scabra by using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. Parts of H. scabra were solvent-extracted and divided into nine fractions including whole body-hexane (WBHE), whole body-ethyl acetate (WBEA), whole body-butanol (WBBU), body wall-hexane (BWHE), body wall-ethyl acetate (BWEA), body wall-butanol (BWBU), viscera-hexane (VIHE), viscera-ethyl acetate (VIEA), and viscera-butanol (VIBU). All fractions of the extracts were tested for anti-oxidant activities by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2\u2032-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays and for anti-ageing effects by lifespan assays using C. elegans as a model. The results showed anti-oxidant properties in all fractions with the highest activity shown by the DPPH assay in WBBU (EC50\u202f=\u202f3.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09\u202fmg/ml), and by the ABTS assay in WBHE (EC50\u202f=\u202f0.31\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fmg/ml). In lifespan assays the highest anti-ageing effect was detected in WBBU- and BWEA-treated C. elegans with increased mean lifespans of 8.12% and 4.77%, respectively. Furthermore, WBBU and BWEA-treated C. elegans exhibited significantly higher resistance against heat shock and paraquat-induced oxidative stresses than controls. By using LC-MS/MS, both extracts were characterized to contain triterpene glycosides as the main bioactive components. To explore mechanisms of H. scabra extracts on longevity and stress resistance, worms with genetic mutations in anti-ageing pathways were analyzed and showed that WBBU and BWEA did not prolong the lifespan of daf-16, age-1, sir-2.1, jnk-1, sek-1, and osr-1 mutants, suggesting that these genetic pathways are involved in mediating the anti-ageing effects of the H. scabra extracts. Moreover, WBBU and BWEA enhanced the nuclear translocation of the FoxO/DAF-16 transcription factor, and increased mRNA expression of this gene and its downstream targets sod-3, hsp12.3, and hsp16.2. In conclusion, this study strongly demonstrates anti-oxidant and anti-ageing properties of H. scabra extracts containing triterpene glycosides, which, in the C. elegans model, may be mediated via the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS)-DAF-16 pathway.",

We aimed to analyse how aging affects key mechanisms responsible for contractile dysfunction via comparing the improperly synchrony between electrical and mechanical activities in male aged-rats (24-month old) comparison to those of adult-rats (6-month old). We determined significantly increased systemic oxidative stress with decreased antioxidant capacity, clear insulin resistance and hypertrophy in aged-rats with normal fasting blood glucose. We also determined significantly high level of reactive oxygen species, ROS production in fluorescent dye chloromethyl-2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluoroscein diacetate (DCFDA) loaded isolated cardiomyocytes from aged-rats, confirming the increased oxidative stress in these hearts. In situ electrocardiograms, ECGs presented significant prolongations in RR- and QT-intervals in the aged-rats. Invasive hemodynamic measurements demonstrated marked increases in the heart rate and mean arterial pressure and decreases in the ejection-fraction and preload-recruitable stroke-work, together with depressed contraction and relaxation activities in aortic rings. In light and electron microscopy examinations in aged-rats, significant increases in muscle fibre radius and amount of collagen fibres were detected in the heart as well as markedly flattened and partial local splitting in elastic lamellas in the aorta, besides irregularly clustered mitochondria and lysosomes around the myofilaments in cardiomyocytes. MitoTEMPO treatment of tissue samples and cardiomyocytes from aged-rats for 1-h induced significant structural improvements. In the second part of our study, we have shown that mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO antagonized all alterations in the heart samples as well as penylephrine-induced contractile and acetylcholine-induced relaxation responses of aged-rat aortic rings. Overall, the present data strongly support the important role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the development of aged-related insufficiencies and that antioxidant strategies specifically targeting this organelle could have therapeutic benefit in aging-associated complications.",

Fifty-two individuals (66.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.2\u202fyears) completed the pre- and post-measurements and were divided into three groups: repetitions to failure (RFG, n\u202f=\u202f17); repetitions not to failure (NFG, n\u202f=\u202f20); and repetitions not to failure with total volume equalized to that in the RFG (ENFG, n\u202f=\u202f15). The participants' sit-to-stand ability, timed-up-and-go (TUG), muscle power output in squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), blood lipids and glucose, as well as blood pressure levels were assessed. A subsample of our participants (n\u202f=\u202f22) also underwent assessment of body composition by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). CT was performed twice weekly for over 12\u202fweeks. In addition to the specific strength training (ST) programme, each group also underwent endurance training (ET) in the same session (i.e., ST immediately followed by ET). After training, all groups improved similarly and significantly in their sit-to-stand ability (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), muscle power output relative to body mass in SJ and CMJ (P\u202f<\u202f0.001), VO2peak (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) and HDL cholesterol levels (P\u202f<\u202f0.001).

Independent of performing repetitions until concentric failure and greater ST volumes, all CT groups exhibited improved sit-to-stand ability, muscle power output, VO2peak and HDL cholesterol levels. In addition, our preliminary data suggest that there are no differences in the effects of the assessed CT approaches on body composition outcomes. We therefore highlight the need for additional well-powered studies to assess whether repetitions to failure could underlie distinct effects on body composition.",

     "abstract": "Older adults have twice as many disabilities and four times as many physical limitations as people <60\u202fyears of age. Positive influence of physical activity to prevent these limitations has been presented in some studies. However, the indispensable combination of physical abilities and body composition parameters to maintain independence in later life and their relationship with physical activity has not been studied thoroughly.The main aim of this study was to determine possible differences in body composition and mobility parameters among older women with various levels of engagement in physical activity. In addition, the relationships between mobility and distinct levels of physical activity were evaluated in healthy older women.Eighty-one healthy older women aged from 65 to 91\u202fyears participated in this study and were allocated to three groups according to weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) time in 10\u202fmin bouts: highest MVPA (H-MVPA) (n\u202f=\u202f27), middle MVPA (M-MVPA) (n\u202f=\u202f40) and lowest MVPA (L-MVPA) (n\u202f=\u202f14). Body composition (fat mass [FM] and fat free mass [FFM]) variables were assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), objective physical activity data were collected with accelerometers and mobility tests were carried out to assess static and dynamic balance, lower limbs strength and aerobic capacity.No differences in body composition parameters were observed between studied groups (p\u202f>\u202f0.0025). Women in L-MVPA covered significantly shorter distance during the six-minute walk test (6MWT) compared to H-MVPA (p\u202f=\u202f0.000) and M-MVPA (p\u202f=\u202f0.003) groups, performed timed-up-and-go (TUG) slower compared to H-MVPA group (p\u202f=\u202f0.003) and five-times-sit-to-stand (FTSTS) test slower compared to H-MVPA (p\u202f=\u202f0.006) and M-MVPA (p\u202f=\u202f0.009) groups. There were no differences in body composition and mobility parameters between women in H-MVPA and M-MVPA groups. Regardless of bout duration, MVPA was correlated with mobility (TUG r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.47; FTSTS r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.37; 6MWT r\u202f=\u202f0.53) parameters, whereas no relationships was observed with light physical activity (LPA).MVPA is associated with body composition and mobility parameters, while LPA is not related to any measured body composition nor mobility parameters. Accordingly, healthy older women could benefit from MVPA to maintain body composition and mobility parameters to preserve independence in later life.",

The study was conducted on the 119 adult subjects aged between 43 and 87\u202fyears residing in the Kyiv region, Ukraine. LTL was determined by a quantitative PCR-based method. LTL was negatively correlated with the measure of abdominal obesity such as waist-hip ratio, as well as with both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and two-hour post-load glucose (2hPG) levels. Consistently with previous studies, a significant negative association between LTL and age was observed in individuals with normal (<5.6\u202fmmol/L) FPG levels. Unexpectedly, however, no association was found in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism assessed by abnormal FPG or/and 2hPG levels. No association between LTL and age was observed in a logistic regression model; the association between LTL and age became significant after adjusting for FPG level. In the FPG-adjusted model, 1.6-time lower odds to have long telomere length were indicated for each 10\u202fyears increase in age.

     "abstract": "Many screening instruments to predict adverse health outcomes in older patients visiting the emergency department (ED) have been developed, but successful implementation has been hampered because they are insufficiently validated or not tailored for the intended use of everyday clinical practice. The present study aims to refine and validate an existing screening instrument (the APOP screener) to predict 90-day functional decline or mortality in older ED patients.Consecutive older patients (\u226570\u202fyears) visiting the EDs of four hospitals were included and prospectively followed. First, an expert panel used predefined criteria to decide which independent predictors (including demographics, illness severity and geriatric parameters) were suitable for refinement of the model predicting functional decline or mortality after 90\u202fdays. Second, the model was cross-validated in all four hospitals and predictive performance was assessed. Additionally, a pilot study among triage nurses experiences and clinical usability of the APOP screener was conducted.In total 2629 older patients were included, with a median age of 79\u202fyears (IQR 74\u201384). After 90\u202fdays 805 patients (30.6%) experienced functional decline or mortality. The refined prediction model included age, gender, way of arrival, need of regular help, need help in bathing/showering, hospitalization the prior six months and impaired cognition. Calibration was good and cross-validation was successful with a pooled area under the curve of 0.71 (0.69\u20130.73). In the top 20% patients predicted to be at highest risk in total 58% (95%CI 54%\u201362%) experienced functional decline or mortality. Triage nurses found the screener well suited for clinical use, with room for improvement.In conclusion, optimization of the APOP screener resulted in a short and more simplified screener, which adequately identifies older ED patients at highest risk for functional decline or mortality. The findings of the pilot study were promising for clinical use.",

     "abstract": "A growing body of research in elderly populations suggests that the early phase of an explosive muscle contraction (i.e., \u2264200\u202fms) may be more functionally relevant than peak values. However, age-related variation in early phase explosive strength has never been investigated across the full-adult life span. This cross-sectional study investigated the age-related changes in the rate of power development (RPD) and compared it to the changes in peak power (Ppeak), both in terms of magnitude and onset, across the adult life span. Age-related declines in power and determinants of muscle power were compared between sexes.1387 adults (\u2642813, \u2640574), aged 18\u201378\u202fyears, performed three maximal isoinertial knee extensor tests at 20% of their isometric maximum on a Biodex dynamometer. Ppeak was calculated as the highest value and RPD as the linear slope of the power-time curve. Velocity (v) and torque (T) at Ppeak were registered.In both men and women, the decline in Ppeak and RPD was already apparent from 40\u202fyears onwards. Annual percent decline rates were greater for RPD (\u22121.1% for men and \u22121.3% for women) than Ppeak (\u22120.9% for men and \u22121.0% for women). Velocity at Ppeak showed the lowest annual percent decline rates (\u22120.3% for men and \u22120.4% for women). Men performed better than women on all parameters (all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Velocity at Ppeak tended to decline more in women than in men (p\u202f=\u202f0.065).To conclude, both knee extensor Ppeak and RPD can be used to screen for age-related neuromuscular weaknesses at an early age. Both sexes seem equally susceptible to age-related declines in knee extensor power. In addition to traditional slow-speed resistance exercise, prevention strategies should include explosive exercises. Explosive exercises may be especially relevant in women, considering that they tend to decline more in the velocity component of muscle power.",

Because of a growing proportion of older adults in the U.S., this brings the problem of age-related morbidity to the forefront as a major contributor to rising medical expenditures. We evaluated 15-year time trends (from 1998 to 2013) in the prevalence of 48 acute and chronic non-cancer diseases and cancers in older U.S. adults aged 65+ and estimated the annual percentage changes of these prevalence trends using SEER-Medicare and HRS-Medicare data. We found that age-adjusted prevalence of cancers of kidney, pancreas, and melanoma, as well as diabetes, renal disease, limb fracture, depression, anemia, weight deficiency, dementia/Alzheimer's disease, drug/medications abuse and several other diseases/conditions increased over time. Conversely, prevalence of myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, pneumonia/influenza, peptic ulcer, and gastrointestinal bleeding, among others, decreased over time. There are also diseases whose prevalence did not change substantially over time, e.g., a group of fast progressing cancers and rheumatoid arthritis. Analysis of trends of multiple diseases performed simultaneously within one study design with focus on the same time interval and the same population for all diseases allowed us to provide insight into the epidemiology of these conditions and identify the most alarming and/or unexpected trends and trade-offs. The obtained results can be used for health expenditures planning for growing sector of older adults in the U.S.",

     "abstract": "Aging is often accompanied by an increase in pro-inflammatory markers. This inflammatory process is directly related to cellular dysfunctions that induce events such as the exacerbated activation of cell death signaling pathways. In the aged brain, dysregulation of the normal activities of neuronal cells compromises brain functions, thereby favoring the onset of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive deficits. Interactions between various stimuli, such as stress, are responsible for the modulation of cellular processes and activities. Physical exercise is a controllable model of stress, largely used as a strategy for studying the physiological mechanisms of inflammatory responses and their consequences. However, different types of physical exercise promote different responses in the organism. The present study was designed to investigate the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and expression and activation of intracellular signaling proteins (CREB, ERK, Akt, p70S6k, STAT5, JNK, NFkB e p38) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation of aged rats submitted to aerobic and resistance exercise. Inflammatory analysis showed that aged rats that underwent resistance training had decreased cortical levels of RANTES and a reduction in the hippocampal levels of MIP-2 when compared with control animals (sedentary). No significant difference was detected in the cortical and hippocampal inflammatory response between aerobic and sedentary groups. However, when comparing the two training models (aerobic vs resistance), it was observed that aerobic training increased the cortical levels of IL-13, IL-6, IL-17\u03b1 compared with resistance training. Regarding the signaling proteins, a significant increase in cortical expression of the proteins JNK, ERK and p70S6k was found in the aerobic group in relation to the sedentary group. No significant change in the cortical and hippocampal expression of signaling proteins was detected between resistance training and sedentary groups. Nevertheless, when training models were compared, it was observed that aerobic training increased cortical expression of the total proteins p38, ERK, Akt and p70S6k in relation to resistance training. Taken together, these results show that changes in the brain expression of inflammatory and cell survival proteins in aged rats depend on the type of physical training.",

In Drosophila, it is well-documented that larval crowding influences fitness-related traits such as body size, starvation resistance and lifespan. However, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood. Here, we show that the effects of increased larval density on life-history traits can be explained by decreased yeast availability in the diet during development. Yeast-poor larval diet alters various life-history traits and mimics the effects of larval crowding. In particular, reduced amount of yeast in larval diet prolongs developmental time, reduces body size, increases body fat content and starvation resistance, and prolongs Drosophila lifespan. Conversely, the effects of larval crowding can be rescued by increasing the concentration of the dietary yeast in the diet during development. Altogether, our results show that the well-known effects of larval crowding on life-history traits are mainly caused by the reduced availability of dietary yeasts due to increased larval competition.",

Senescent cells can activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell metabolism, cellular growth, and autophagy in senescence-associated cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we examined whether mTOR pathway could induce cellular senescence by inhibition of autophagy in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We found that adriamycin-induced VSMC senescence is accompanied by increased activity of mTOR, a major controller of cell growth and a negative regulator of autophagy. VSMC senescence induced by activation of mTOR pathway led to reduced levels of signal-associated autophagy proteins, and inhibition of mTOR pathway resulted in a drastic decrease in the number of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal)-stained cells and increased levels of signal-associated autophagy proteins. Autophagic inhibition potentiated adriamycin-induced mTOR pathway activation as well as increase in the number of SA-\u03b2-gal-stained VSMCs. Results of further experiments showed that mTOR pathway inhibition regulates adriamycin-induced expression of senescence markers (p53/p21/p16), which plays an important role in different aspects of cellular aging. Taken together, these results support the idea that intervention to modulate the interaction between mTOR pathway and autophagy could be a potential strategy for longevity.",

The mechanisms driving age-related tissue fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction are unclear, yet clinically important. Drosophila is amenable to the study of cardiac ageing as well as collagen deposition; however it is unclear whether collagen accumulates in the ageing Drosophila heart.This work examined collagen deposition and cardiac function in ageing Drosophila, in the context of reduced expression of collagen-interacting protein SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine) an evolutionarily conserved protein linked with fibrosis. Heart function was measured using high frame rate videomicroscopy. Collagen deposition was monitored using a fluorescently-tagged collagen IV reporter (encoded by the Viking gene) and staining of the cardiac collagen, Pericardin.The Drosophila heart accumulated collagen IV and Pericardin as flies aged. Associated with this was a decline in cardiac function. SPARC heterozygous flies lived longer than controls and showed little to no age-related cardiac dysfunction. As flies of both genotypes aged, cardiac levels of collagen IV (Viking) and Pericardin increased similarly. Over-expression of SPARC caused cardiomyopathy and increased Pericardin deposition.The findings demonstrate that, like humans, the Drosophila heart develops a fibrosis-like phenotype as it ages. Although having no gross impact on collagen accumulation, reduced SPARC expression extended Drosophila lifespan and cardiac health span. It is proposed that cardiac fibrosis in humans may develop due to the activation of conserved mechanisms and that SPARC may mediate cardiac ageing by mechanisms more subtle than gross accumulation of collagen.",

Understanding of age-related cardiovascular changes is necessary for effective and efficient prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in older people. Cardiac aging is associated with left ventricular remodelling marked by increased mass-to-volume ratio and accompanied by systolic and diastolic myocardial dysfunction, and reduced sensitivity to sympathetic stimuli that compromises myocardial contractility and pumping ability in older people. The vascular age-related remodelling is associated with increased arterial wall thickness, arterial stiffness, and an impaired endothelial vasoreactivity. Over the previous three decades of intensive research in cardiovascular aging, it became apparently clear that lifestyle factors such as physical activity and exercise play an important role in attenuating cardiovascular function decline with aging. This review highlights the effect of age on cardiac and vascular changes and their adaptations to exercise, providing physiological, molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie diminished cardiovascular response in older age.

The trial was completed by 82% of the participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0342): MEX (n\u00a0=\u00a090); ACEi (n\u00a0=\u00a066); ACEiMEX (n\u00a0=\u00a0186). Baseline and 2-year follow-up evaluations included the Senior Fitness Test battery, Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36), the health history questionnaires, anthropometric and hemodynamic profile.MEX and ACEiMEX groups improved all physical functional status outcomes, decreased systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and augmented the physical functioning, role physical and physical component score (PCS) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but also bodily pain (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The ACEi group reduced the upper body strength, upper and lower body flexibility and aerobic endurance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); worsened the anthropometric profile, and SBP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); and decreased general health and PCS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The improvement of the physical functioning and HRQoL in older hypertensive adults using ACEi medications only occur if they adopt an exercise training regimen, increasing also the management of the blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors.",

We used different approaches: morphology and function by echocardiography, reactivity of the coronary bed and left ventricular contractibility (Langendorff Technique). Female Wistar ovariectomized (OVX) rats (n\u00a0=\u00a042) were assigned to one of four groups: OVX, vehicle treated only; OVX-EM, Enalapril Maleate only (EM, 10\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u2212\u00a01\u00b7d\u2212\u00a01); OVX-T, aerobic trained only; and OVX-EMT, treated with Enalapril Maleate and aerobic trained. Both Enalapril Maleate treatment and aerobic training were done in the last 20\u00a0weeks of the experimental protocol. When compared to the OVX group, the OVX-EM group showed lower values of wall thickness and left ventricular (LV) mass, lower values of coronary bed reactivity and reduced maximum response of LV contractility to dobutamine, while the OVX-T group showed lower values of LV wall thickness, increase in end-systolic volume, reduced maximum response of LV contractility to dobutamine, and left intraventricular pressure due to increased flow. The combination of treatments (EM and aerobic physical training) did not promote additional important effects on the parameters evaluated.Our results suggest similar beneficial effects of physical training and EM treatment on the morphology and cardiac function in old female rats submitted to premature ovarian failure. Although the causes of these benefits are still unknown, both treatments have promoted a decrease in cardiac contractility, and the reduced \u03b21-adrenergic sensitivity suggests that both treatments may attenuate the sympathetic effect on the heart.",

     "abstract": "Age-related arterial inflammation is associated with dysfunction of the arteries and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. To determine if aging increases arterial immune cell infiltration as well as the populations of immune cells principally involved, we tested the hypothesis that large elastic and resistance arteries in old mice would exhibit increased immune cell infiltration compared to young controls. Additionally, we hypothesized that vasoprotective lifestyle interventions such as lifelong caloric restriction or 8\u00a0weeks of voluntary wheel running would attenuate age-related arterial immune cell infiltration. The aorta and mesenteric vasculature with surrounding perivascular adipose was excised from young normal chow (YNC, 4\u20136\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a010), old normal chow (ONC, 28\u201329\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a011), old caloric restricted (OCR, 28\u201329\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a09), and old voluntary running (OVR, 28\u201329\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a05) mice and digested to a single cell suspension. The cells were then labeled with antibodies against CD45 (total leukocytes), CD3 (pan T cells), CD4 (T helper cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T cells), CD19 (B cells), CD11b, and F4/80 (macrophages) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Total leukocytes, T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets), B cells, and macrophages in both aorta and mesentery were all 5- to 6-fold greater in ONC compared to YNC. Age-related increases in T cell (both CD4+ and CD8+), B cell, and macrophage infiltration in aorta were abolished in OCR mice. OVR mice exhibited 50% lower aortic T cell and normalized macrophage infiltration. B cell infiltration was not affected by VR. Age-related mesenteric CD8+ T cell and macrophage infiltration was normalized in OCR and OVR mice compared to young mice, whereas B cell infiltration was normalized by CR but not VR. Splenic CD4+ T cells from ONC mice exhibited a 3-fold increase in gene expression for the T helper (Th) 1 transcription factor, Tbet, and a 4-fold increase in FoxP3, a T regulatory cell transcription factor, compared to YNC. Splenic B cells and mesenteric macrophages from old mice exhibited decreased proinflammatory cytokine gene expression regardless of treatment group. These results demonstrate that aging is associated with infiltration of immune cells around both the large-elastic and resistance arteries and that the vasoprotective lifestyle interventions, CR and VR, can ameliorate age-related arterial immune cell infiltration.",

     "abstract": "Cardiovascular aging is a highly dynamic process. Despite the fact that cardiovascular function and structure change with age, they can still be modulated even in aged humans. The most prominent approaches to improve age-dependent vascular changes include dietary restriction and pharmacologic agents interacting with signaling pathways implicated in this context. These include inhibition of TOR, glycolysis, and GH/IGF-1, activation of sirtuins, and AMPK, as well as modulators of inflammation, epigenetic pathways, and telomeres. Promising nutritional approaches include Mediterranean diet and novel dietary bioactives including flavanols, anthocyanins, and lignins. Many plant bioactives improve cardiovascular parameters implied in vascular healthy aging including endothelial function, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glycemic control. However, the mechanism of action of most bioactives is not established and it remains to be elucidated whether they act as dietary restriction mimetics or via other modes of action. Even more importantly, whether these interventions can slow or even reverses components of cardiovascular aging itself and can increase healthspan or longevity in humans needs to be determined.",

Diet, and particularly its fat content, modulates the inflammatory response in fasting and postprandial states.We aimed to study the effects of dietary fat on endotoxemia in healthy older adults.Twenty healthy older adults were randomized to three diets, lasting three-weeks each, using a crossover design: 1. A Mediterranean diet enriched in MUFA with virgin olive oil. 2. An SFA-rich diet. 3. A low-fat high-carbohydrate diet enriched in n-3 PUFA (\u03b1-linolenic acid of plant origin) (CHO-PUFA diet). At the end of each period, after a 12-h fast, the subjects received a meal with a composition similar to the dietary period just completed. We determined the fasting and the postprandial plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP).In the fasting state, we observed lower LPS plasma levels after the consumption of the CHO-PUFA diet (P\u00a0=\u00a00.046) in comparison with the consumption of the Med and SFA-rich diets. In the postprandial measurements, we observed a statistically significant increase in plasma levels of LPS (P\u00a0=\u00a00.044) and a decrease in LBP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) after the intake of the CHO-PUFA meal, whereas no postprandial changes were observed after the ingestion of the Med and SFA-rich meals.Our results, together with those obtained in a previous study, support the concept that the consumption of the Med Diet, in contrast to a low-fat PUFA diet, constitutes a more suitable dietary lifestyle for preventing the development of atherosclerosis in a population at risk, such as older adults.",

     "abstract": "The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is dramatically increasing among elderly population. Metabolic syndrome in aged individuals is associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance both in metabolic tissues and in the cardiovascular system, with this fact being associated with the cardiometabolic alterations associated to this condition. Caloric restriction (CR) improves insulin sensitivity and is one of the dietetic strategies most commonly used to enlarge life and to prevent aging induced cardiovascular alterations. The aim of this study was to analyze the possible beneficial effects of CR in aging-induced vascular insulin resistance both in aortic rings and in primary culture of endothelial cells. In addition, the inflammatory profile of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and its possible role in the impairment of vascular insulin sensitivity associated with aging was also assessed. Three experimental groups of male Wistar rats were used: 3 (3\u00a0m), 24 (24\u00a0m) fed ad libitum and 24\u00a0months old rats subjected to 20% CR during their three last months of life (24\u00a0m\u2013CR). Aorta rings surrounded or not by PVAT were mounted in an organ bath and precontracted with phenylephrine (10\u2212\u00a07.5\u00a0M). Changes in isometric tension were recorded in response to cumulative insulin concentrations (10\u2212\u00a08\u201310\u2212\u00a05.5\u00a0M) in the presence or absence of L-NAME (10\u2212\u00a04\u00a0M). Aortic rings and primary aortic endothelial cells were incubated in presence/absence of insulin (10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M) and the activation of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways as well as nitrite and nitrates concentrations and the mRNA levels of eNOS, insulin receptor, and GLUT-4 were assessed. CR prevented the aging-induced decrease in the vasodilator response to insulin and the aging-induced increase in the vasoconstrictor response to high insulin concentrations. Changes between 24\u00a0m and 24\u00a0m\u2013CR aorta rings were abolished in the presence of L-NAME. CR induced-improvement in insulin vascular sensitivity was related with activation of the PI3K/Akt both in aortic rings and in aortic endothelial cells in response to insulin. CR attenuated the overexpression of iNOS, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the PVAT of aged rats although aortic rings surrounded by PVAT from 24\u00a0m rats showed and increased vasorelaxation in response to insulin compared to aortic rings from 3\u00a0m and 24\u00a0m\u2013CR rats. In conclusion, a moderate protocol of CR improves insulin vascular sensitivity and prevents the aging induced overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PVAT.",

It is also an essential brain compound and some hypothesize that it aids cognition by improving energy supply and neuroprotection. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of oral creatine administration on cognitive function in healthy individuals.A search of multiple electronic databases was performed for the identification of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the cognitive effects of oral creatine supplementation in healthy individuals.Six studies (281 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Generally, there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration. Regarding other cognitive domains, such as long-term memory, spatial memory, memory scanning, attention, executive function, response inhibition, word fluency, reaction time and mental fatigue, the results were conflicting. Performance on cognitive tasks stayed unchanged in young individuals. Vegetarians responded better than meat-eaters in memory tasks but for other cognitive domains no differences were observed.Oral creatine administration may improve short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear. Findings suggest potential benefit for aging and stressed individuals. Since creatine is safe, future studies should include larger sample sizes. It is imperative that creatine should be tested on patients with dementias or cognitive impairment.",

     "abstract": "Insulin is the principal postprandial anabolic hormone and resistance to its action could contribute to sarcopenia. We developed different types of hyperinsulinemic clamp protocols to measure simultaneously glucose and protein metabolism in insulin resistant states (older adults, obesity, diabetes, etc.). To define effects of healthy aging in response to insulin, we employed the hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic and isoaminoacidemic (HYPER-1) clamp. The net whole-body anabolic (protein balance) response to hyperinsulinemia was lower in the elderly vs young (p\u202f=\u202f0.007) and was highly correlated with the clamp glucose rate of disposal (r\u202f=\u202f0.671, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), indicating insulin resistance of protein metabolism concurrent with that of glucose. Differences in insulin resistance due to aging were observed predominantly in men, with older ones exhibiting significant lower anabolism compared with young ones. As most of the anabolism occurs during feeding, we studied the fed-state metabolic responses with aging using the hyperinsulinemic, hyperglycemic and hyperaminoacidemic clamp, including muscle biopsies. Older women showed comparable whole-body protein anabolic responses and stimulation of mixed-muscle protein synthesis by feeding to the young. The responses of skeletal muscle insulin signaling through the Akt-mTORC1 pathway were also unaltered, and therefore consistent with muscle protein synthesis results. Given that type 2 diabetes infers insulin resistance of protein metabolism with aging, we studied 10 healthy, 8 obese, and 8 obese type 2 diabetic elderly women using the HYPER-1 clamp. When compared to the group of young lean women to define the effects of obesity and diabetes with aging, whole-body change in net protein balance with hyperinsulinemia was similarly blunted in obese and diabetic older women. However, only elderly obese women with diabetes had lower net balance than lean older women. We conclude that with usual aging, the blunted whole-body anabolic response in elderly subjects is mediated by the failure of insulin to stimulate protein synthesis to the same extent as in the young, especially in men. This blunted response can be overcome at the whole-body and muscle levels during an intravenous fed state supplying a generous amount of protein, in active healthy elderly women. Obese elderly women with and without type 2 diabetes have insulin resistance of protein anabolism at the whole-body level, but this resistance is worsened with diabetes when glucose metabolism is further impaired. More investigation is needed to determine the exact role of insulin in promoting anabolism with aging. The findings from our group are relevant for the field of sarcopenia research as they provide a rationale to offer low cost nutritional interventions for overcoming this detrimental condition associated with aging and diabetes.",

Japanese quail is a very unique and advantageous model to study the signs and symptoms of senescence in the central and peripheral modules of HPG axis. In the present study, we have investigated the age dependent variations in hypothalamic deep brain photoreceptors (DBPs), central GnRH-I/II-GnIH-Mel1cR system, testicular GnRH-GnIH system, testicular steroidogenic genes and proteins, androgen receptor (AR) and serum testosterone level in quail of different age groups [3-wk (sexually immature), 6-wk (sexually mature and crossed the puberty), 16-wk (adult, sexually active and showing full breeding phase) and 144-wk (aged)]. Findings of our present study showed the differential expression of these genes/proteins in quail of different age groups. The low levels of the DBPs, GnRH-I, GnIH, Mel1cR in hypothalamus and GnRH-II in midbrain, significantly decreased testicular GnRH/GnRH-R-GnIH, steroidogenic genes/proteins and serum testosterone were observed in immature quail. The significantly increased expression of opsins in the DBPs, GnRH-I, GnIH, Mel1cR in hypothalamus and GnRH-II in midbrain influences the testicular GnRH-GnIH and stimulate the testicular steroidogenesis in mature and adult quail. In aged quail, the significantly decreased levels of hypothalamic DBPs, GnRH-I, GnIH, Mel1cR and midbrain GnRH-II modulates the testicular GnRH-GnIH and further suppresses the genes/proteins involved in steroidogenesis and results in reduced serum testosterone. Hence, it can be concluded from our findings that the testicular steroidogenesis and its neuroendocrine regulation varies with age, in Japanese quail.",

Fifty-two individuals (66.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.2\u202fyears) completed the pre- and post-measurements and were divided into three groups: repetitions to failure (RFG, n\u202f=\u202f17); repetitions not to failure (NFG, n\u202f=\u202f20); and repetitions not to failure with total volume equalized to RFG (ENFG, n\u202f=\u202f15). Participants were assessed in isometric knee extension peak torque (PTiso), maximal strength (1RM) in the leg press (LP) and knee extension (KE) exercises, quadriceps femoris muscle thickness (QF MT), specific tension, rate of torque development (RTD) at 50, 100 and 250\u202fms, countermovement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) performance, as well as maximal neuromuscular activity (EMGmax) of the vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles. CT was performed over 12\u202fweeks, twice weekly. Along with each specific strength training program, each group also underwent an endurance training in the same session.

QF MT improved only in RFG and ENFG (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). These results suggest that repetitions until concentric failure does not provide further neuromuscular performance gains and muscle hypertrophy, and that even a low number of repetitions relative to the maximal possible (i.e., 50%) optimizes neuromuscular performance in elderly men. Moreover, training volume appears to be more important for muscle hypertrophy than training using maximal repetitions.",

     "abstract": "Dynapenia is prevalent in people with reduced skeletal muscle mass, i.e. sarcopenia, but a certain population develops muscle strength loss despite having normal skeletal muscle volume. To date, studies investigating muscle quality and quantity in groups with dynapenia but not sarcopenia are limited.Echogenicity and thickness of the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, rectus femoris, and medial gastrocnemius muscles were measured using high-resolution ultrasonography in 140 community-dwelling elderly adults. Participants with decreased handgrip strength but normal muscular volume were diagnosed as having dynapenia without sarcopenia. A multivariate regression model was used to analyze the association between dynapenia and ultrasound indicators of the sampled muscle expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).A total of 140 participants were recruited for the study, 12.6% (n\u202f=\u202f18) of whom had dynapenia. The dynapenia group had a higher mean age, higher proportion of women, slower fast gait speed, reduced handgrip strength, and decreased thicknesses of the biceps brachii, rectus femoris, and medial gastrocnemius muscles. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, dynapenia was associated with older age (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.33), higher body mass index (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.64), and decreased thicknesses of the rectus femoris (OR, 0.01; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.24) and medial gastrocnemius muscles (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.61).Dynapenia without sarcopenia is associated with decreased thicknesses of the rectus femoris and medial gastrocnemius muscles, an association that remains significant after adjustment for demographics, body composition, and physical performance. Ultrasound measurements of lower-limb muscle thickness can be considered an auxiliary criterion for evaluating dynapenia.",

Exercise is effective in preventing and treating degenerative brain diseases as it activates blood flow to the brain, increases nerve production in the hippocampus, and promotes the expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of 16-week aquatic and land-based exercise programs on amyloid beta (A\u03b2), heat shock protein (HSP) 27 levels, and pulse wave velocity (PWV).Forty elderly women, aged 60\u201370\u202fyears, voluntarily participated in the study. They were divided into control (n\u202f=\u202f12), aquatic exercise (n\u202f=\u202f14), and land-based exercise groups (n\u202f=\u202f14). The variables of amyloid beta, heat shock protein 27, and pulse wave velocity were measured in all the participants before and after the 16-week study.Significantly higher levels of serum HSP27 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and significantly lower levels of vascular elasticity (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) were found in the aquatic exercise group after 16\u202fweeks of exercise compared with the control group. A\u03b2 did not significantly differ between groups. Thirty minutes after the first exercise, A\u03b2 in the aquatic exercise group (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and HSP27 in the land-based exercise group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) were significantly higher than the corresponding levels in the resting condition before exercise. 30\u202fmin after the last exercise, A\u03b2 (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and HSP27 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) were significantly higher.Aquatic and land-based exercises increased serum A\u03b2 and HSP27 and decreased pulse wave velocity.

Changes in the cell cycle and \u03b2-galactosidase activity were analyzed to evaluate the extent of cell aging. Stabilities of mitochondrial mRNA and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were evaluated in the process of cell aging under different treatments. The mitochondrial function was also evaluated using the Seahorse Metabolic Analysis System combined with ATP production. The unfolded protein response (UPR) of the N2a cells was analyzed under different treatments. Results showed that spermidine pretreatment could delay the cell aging and could maintain the mitochondrial stability during d\u2011Gal treatment. Spermidine increased the proportion of cells in the S phase and maintained the MMP. The oxygen utilization and ATP production in the N2a cells were reduced by d\u2011Gal treatment but were partially rescued by the spermidine pretreatment. Spermidine ameliorated the N2a cell aging by promoting the autophagy and inhibiting the apoptosis except the UPR. These results showed that spermidine could ameliorate the N2a cell aging by maintaining the mitochondrial mRNA transcription, MMP and oxygen utilization during the d\u2011Gal treatment.",

We use SHARE (Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) panel data to investigate whether the onset of dynapenia at 4-year follow-up can be explained by pre-existing (either at baseline, or at 2-year follow-up) depressive symptoms, or vice versa. Depressive symptoms were identified as a score of 4 or more on the 12-item EURO-D scale. Individuals were classified as affected by dynapenia if they had handgrip strength of <20\u202fkg for women and 30\u202fkg for men. We estimate whether being affected by symptoms of depression at baseline or becoming symptomatic between baseline and a 2-year follow-up increases the odds-ratio (OR) for dynapenia at a 4-year follow-up among individuals with no muscle strength impairment at baseline. We also carry out the reverse analysis, and study whether dynapenia at baseline or incident dynapenia between baseline and first follow-up increase the probability that individuals develop depressive symptoms by the second follow-up. The analysis was carried out using multivariate logistic regression. After adjusting for a full set of potential confounders, being symptomatic for depression at baseline did not increase the risk of dynapenia at the 4-year follow-up. Instead, individuals developing depressive symptoms between baseline and the 2-year follow-up had a 34% increased risk of developing dynapenia at the 4-year follow-up (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02 1.66). No significant association was detected between dynapenia at baseline or the onset of dynapenia between baseline and the 2-year follow-up and the incidence of depressive symptoms at the 4-year follow-up. In conclusion, our results support the effect of the onset of depressive symptoms on the onset of dynapenia, even after considering the role of confounding factors.",

     "abstract": "Studies in model organisms have identified a variety of genes whose expression can be experimentally modulated to produce changes in longevity, but whether these genes are the same as those involved in natural variation in lifespan remains unclear. Social insects boast some of the largest lifespan differences known between plastic phenotypes, with queen and worker lifespans differing by an order of magnitude despite no systematic nucleotide sequence differences between them. The contrasting lifespans of queens and workers are thus the result of differences in gene expression. We used RNA sequencing of brains and legs in 1-day-old and 2-month-old individuals of the ant Lasius niger to determine whether genes with queen-biased expression are enriched for genes linked to ageing in model organisms. Because the great longevity of queens may require investment into immune processes, we also investigated whether queen-biased genes are enriched for genes with known roles in immunity. Queen-biased genes in legs were enriched for ageing genes and for genes associated with increasing rather than decreasing lifespan. Queen-biased genes in legs were also enriched for immune genes, but only in 1-day-old individuals, perhaps linked to the changing roles of workers with age. Intriguingly, the single most differentially expressed gene between 1-day-old queen and worker brains was an extra-cellular form of CuZn Superoxide Dismutase (SOD3), raising the possibility of an important role of anti-oxidant genes in modulating lifespan.",

Sarcopenia was defined as low ALM/height (m2) and low hand grip strength or gait speed (European Working Group definition); obesity was defined as body fat percentage \u226530%. MetS was assessed at baseline and 5-years later. Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was assessed at 5-years only.Men with sarcopenic obesity (odds ratio, 95% CI: 2.07, 1.21\u20133.55) and non-sarcopenic obesity (4.19, 3.16\u20135.57) had higher MetS likelihood than those with non-sarcopenic non-obesity at baseline. Higher gait speed predicted lower odds for prevalent MetS (0.45, 0.21\u20130.96 per m/s). Higher body fat predicted increased odds for prevalent and incident MetS (1.14, 1.11\u20131.17 and 1.11, 1.02\u20131.20 per kg, respectively) and deleterious 5-year changes in MetS fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (all P\u202f<\u202f0.05).

However, it is uncertain whether depressive symptoms would amplify balance problems in older adults with MCI.Aim: To evaluate if the presence of significant depressive symptoms affects postural sway under somatosensory challenges in a MCI population.Methods: Eighty two participants (mean of 75.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.4\u202fyears of age; 46% women) with MCI completed cognitive and balance assessments. Participants were grouped by severity of depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, as MCI with depressive symptoms (MCI-D\u202f=\u202f14, score\u202f\u2265\u202f5) and MCI without depressive symptoms (MCI\u202f=\u202f68, score\u202f<\u202f5). Postural sway area was evaluated during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) while standing on a rigid flat force plate platform, and compared across groups. Analyses were controlled for age, sex, comorbidities, anti-depressant medication use, executive function, and baseline sway.Results: MCI-D showed larger postural sway area when compared with MCI irrespective of visual feedback conditions (p\u202f=\u202f0.03). This difference remained significant after adjusting for anti-depressant use and executive function performance. The lack of interaction between groups and visual condition was associated with group differences in postural sway during EO condition (Beta\u202f=\u202f0.08, CI \u2212257.5\u2013621.9; p\u202f=\u202f0.41) and by comparable sway increase from EO to EC in both groups.Conclusion: Depressive symptoms in individuals with MCI worsened postural stability during both eyes open and eyes closed conditions independently of cognitive function. Significant depressive symptoms may affect balance in MCI populations, potentially increasing the risk of falls.",

     "abstract": "Chronic inflammation and Advanced Glycation End products (AGE) are associated with sarcopenia. Decreased voluntary muscle activation and increased antagonist coactivation can contribute to age-related muscle weakness. The influence of chronic inflammation and AGE in these neuromuscular mechanisms is not clear. We studied whether a relation exists between circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines and AGEs as well as the interplay between agonist and antagonist muscle activation. We studied 64 community-dwelling old subjects, during a maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) and a reaction-time (RT) test of the upper limb. Twenty-five circulating inflammatory biomarkers were determined. Linear regression showed significant relationships between chronic inflammation and six muscle activation parameters. MIP-1\u03b2 showed a significant negative relation with antagonist coactivation (during MVC) and antagonist muscle activity during pre-movement time (PMT) and movement time (MT) (during RT). A higher level of pentosidine (AGE) was predictive for a longer PMT. We conclude that in older relatively healthy persons antagonist muscle activation is influenced by chronic inflammation, contributing to age-related muscle weakness. Our results also suggest a mechanical and inflammatory influence of pentosidine in upper limb slowing of movement. These findings show novel insight in underlying mechanisms of age-related muscle weakness.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether exercise training could protect against erectile dysfunction by increasing serum testosterone and penile eNOS levels in aging rats.A total of 14 young (2-month-old) and 14 middle-aged (18-month-old) Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either untrained control (young control, [YC], middle-aged control, [MC]) or endurance exercise-trained (young exercise, [YE], middle-aged exercise, [ME]) groups with seven rats per group. The exercise groups trained with treadmill running for 6\u202fweeks. Body composition parameters (body weight, heart mass, liver mass, and testicular mass), serum sex hormone levels (testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin), endothelial function-related parameters in the penis (endothelial nitric oxide synthase [eNOS], CD31, alpha smooth muscle actin [\u03b1-SMA]), and maximal intracavernous pressure measure (ICP) and total ICP were analyzed in middle-aged rats.The middle-aged groups showed increased body weight, as compared with the young groups, but exercise training attenuated the aging-induced increase in body weight. The middle-aged groups had lower testicular mass compared with the young groups, but exercise training attenuated aging-induced decreases in testicular mass. Exercise training increased serum testosterone levels in both the young and middle-aged groups. However, there were no changes in the levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin among the groups.

Interestingly, exercise training also increased protein levels of \u03b1-SMA and maximal ICP in the middle-aged group.Exercise training has beneficial effects on erectile function in aged rats through increased testosterone production from the testis and strengthening of the cavernous endothelium with activation of eNOS.

     "abstract": "NO-cGMP signaling pathway has been implicated in reduction of testicular steroidogenesis during aging. Here we analyzed the effect of PDE5 inhibition on old testicular phenotype formation. The old phenotype exhibited low testosterone and increased nitrite levels in circulation, increased cGMP accumulation in testicular interstitial fluid (TIF), progressive atrophy of testicular seminiferous tubules and enlargement of interstitial area followed by rise in blood vessel density and slight increase in the number of Leydig cells and macrophages. Leydig cells have reduced steroidogenic capacity, increased MAP kinases expression (MEK, ERK1/2, JNK) and antiapoptotic PRKG1 and AKT, suggesting increased proliferation/survival and accumulation of senescent Leydig cells in testis. In 12\u202fmonth-old rats, a long-term treatment with sildenafil (PDE5 inhibitor) normalized testosterone/nitrite levels in circulation and cGMP accumulation in TIF; improved Leydig cell steroidogenic capacity; decreased MEK, ERK1/2 and PRKG1 expression; prevented an increase in the Leydig cells number and atrophy of seminiferous tubules leading to histological appearance of young rat testes. In 18\u202fmonth-old rats, long-term PDE5 inhibition partially recovered testosterone and nitrite levels in serum; normalized PRKG1 expression without effect on MEK and ERK1/2; and slowed down Leydig cell and macrophage accumulation and regressive tubular changes. Culturing of primary Leydig cells from aged rats in presence of PDE5-inhibitor stimulated steroidogenic and MAPK gene expression.

Conversely, the effect of obesity followed by oophorectomy on brain oxidative stress, brain apoptosis, synaptic function and cognitive function, particularly in hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent memory, has not been investigated. Our hypothesis was that oophorectomy aggravated metabolic impairment, brain dysfunction and cognitive impairment in obese rats. Thirty-two female rats were fed with either a normal diet (ND, n\u202f=\u202f16) or a high-fat diet (HFD, n\u202f=\u202f16) for a total of 20\u202fweeks. At week 13, rats in each group were subdivided into sham and ovariectomized subgroups (n\u202f=\u202f8/subgroup). At week 20, all rats were tested for hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent memory by using Morris water maze test (MWM) and Novel objective recognition (NOR) tests, respectively. We found that the obese-insulin resistant condition occurred in sham-HFD-fed rats (HFS), ovariectomized-ND-fed rats (NDO), and ovariectomized-HFD-fed rats (HFO). Increased hippocampal oxidative stress level, increased hippocampal apoptosis, increased hippocampal synaptic dysfunction, decreased hippocampal estrogen level and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory were observed in HFS, NDO, and HFO rats. However, the hippocampal-independent memory, cortical estrogen levels, cortical ROS production, and cortical apoptosis showed no significant difference between groups. These findings suggested that oophorectomy and obesity exclusively impaired hippocampal-dependent memory, possibly via increased hippocampal dysfunction. Nonetheless, oophorectomy did not aggravate these deleterious effects under conditions of obesity.",

Thirty-eight overweight and obese (BMI\u202f=\u202f30.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.4\u202fkg/m2) older (age\u202f=\u202f69.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.1\u202fy) women completed 6\u202fmonths of multicomponent exercise (cardiorespiratory, resistance, balance and flexibility training) and weight loss (hypocaloric diet that reduced energy intake by ~500\u202fkcal/d). Body composition was measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and muscle quality (N-m/kg) was defined as maximal concentric isokinetic knee torque divided by upper-leg lean mass. The standardized scores of four objective measures of physical function were summed to yield a composite LEPF Z-score. At 6\u202fmonths, there were significant reductions in body weight (\u22129.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.5%, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), absolute fat mass (\u22126.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.4\u202fkg, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and relative adiposity (\u22124.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.1%, p\u202f<\u202f0.01).

A reduction in body weight also predicted an improvement in LEPF, independent of the change in muscle quality. In conclusion, muscle quality can be increased in the presence of clinically meaningful weight loss, and is the primary determinant of improved physical function in overweight/obese older women.",

Two hundred thirty one peptides were detected, from which 143 proteins were identified. There were 52 proteins with >25% increase in concentrations in the old sheep compared to the young. 33 of them increased >25% but <50%, 13 increased >50% but <1 fold, 6 increased >1 fold [i.e. haptoglobin (Hp), haemoglobin, neuroendocrine protein 7B2, IgM, fibrous sheath interacting protein 1, vimentin].

     "abstract": "A variety of mild stresses have been shown to extend lifespan in diverse species through hormesis, which is a beneficial response to a stress or toxin that would cause a negative response at a higher exposure. Whether particular stresses induce hormesis can vary with genotype for a given species, and the underlying mechanisms of lifespan extension are only partly understood in most cases. We show that low doses of the DNA damaging or replication stress agents hydroxyurea, methyl methanesulfonate, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, or Zeocin (a phleomycin derivative) lengthened chronological lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae if cells were exposed during growth, but not if they were exposed during stationary phase. Treatment with these agents did not change mitochondrial activity, increase resistance to acetic acid, ethanol, or heat stress, and three of four treatments did not increase resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Stationary phase yeast populations consist of both quiescent and nonquiescent cells, and all four treatments increased the proportion of quiescent cells. Several mutant strains with deletions in genes that influence quiescence prevented Zeocin treatment from extending lifespan and from increasing the proportion of quiescent stationary phase cells. These data indicate that mild DNA damage stress can extend lifespan by promoting quiescence in the absence of mitohormesis or improved general stress responses that have been frequently associated with improved longevity in other cases of hormesis. Further study of the underlying mechanism may yield new insights into quiescence regulation that will be relevant to healthy aging.",

Frailty, an independent predictor of fractures and decreased bone mineral density is associated with altered bone metabolism in women. However, no previous works have studied the relationship among frailty, Hcy levels and bone turnover.We studied the association among Hcy, osteoporosis and N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (\u03b2-CTX), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in 631 Spanish women between the ages of 65\u201378 from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA) cohort, who were classified as highly functional (robust subjects) or non-robust (pre-frail or frail subjects) according to Fried's criteria.Hcy was independently associated with \u03b2-CTX in the entire population (B\u202f=\u202f0.22; 95% CI, 0.09\u20130.34; p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and in the non-robust group (B\u202f=\u202f0.24; 95% CI, 0.09\u20130.39; p\u202f=\u202f0.002). Hcy was also associated with PINP in the entire and non-robust populations, but the association was lost after including the levels of \u03b2-CTX, but not the other bone biomarkers, in the multivariate analysis. This suggests that the controversial relationship between Hcy and bone formation might be explained, at least to a certain extent, by the confounding effects of \u03b2-CTX.This work highlights the important implication of frailty status in the association between Hcy and increased bone turnover in older women.",

Frailty was defined using the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture (SOF) index as the presence of at least two of the following criteria: (i) weight loss \u22655% between baseline and any subsequent follow-up visit; (ii) inability to do five chair stands; and (iii) low energy level according to the SOF definition. Multivariable Cox's regression analyses, calculating hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were undertaken.Of the 4292 participants (mean age: 61.3), 58.7% were female. During the 8-year follow-up, 348 subjects (8.1% of the baseline population) developed frailty.

Variants of an important enzyme of energy metabolism, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (dld), have been genetically linked to late-onset AD. Moreover, reduced activity of DLD-containing enzyme complexes is associated with AD progression. To understand how energy metabolism influences AD progression, we exposed C. elegans expressing human A\u03b2 peptide to the chemical inhibitor of DLD, 2-methoxyindole-5-carboxylic acid (MICA). Expression of human A\u03b2 in C. elegans causes a variety of pathologies that can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatments against proteotixicity. We found that MICA alleviated the A\u03b2-induced paralysis and improved cholinergic neurotransmission in C. elegans that express A\u03b2 in muscle cells. MICA also reduced both hypersensitivity to serotonin and perturbation of chemotaxis associated with neuronal expression of human A\u03b2. Furthermore, low doses of MICA helped to alleviate an A\u03b2-mediated decrease in fecundity. Protection against AD pathogenesis by MICA in the C. elegans model was associated with a decrease in A\u03b2 oligomerization that could be reversed by the calcium ionophore, A23187. MICA also caused a decrease in oxidative stress, which could also contribute to the protective effect of MICA against A\u03b2 toxicity.",

Maximal dynamic strength of knee extensors improved in 10.6% of WA, 8.0% of WR, and 4.7% of CG participants, without any difference between the groups. Maximal dynamic strength of knee flexors was increased in 14.1% of WA and in 17.7% of WR participants; however, it remains unchanged in CG participants. No differences were observed in resting heart rate, peak heart rate, heart rate at the second ventilatory threshold and maximal dynamic strength of shoulder horizontal flexors.

The following anthropometric measurements were made in all participants: body weight, body height, the circumferences of waist, hip and neck. Body fat percentage and visceral fat rating (VFR) were determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis. The measurements were then used to calculate body mass index (BMI), body fat mass index (BFMI), body adiposity index (BAI), the waist-hip ratio (WHR) and the waist-height ratio (WHtR). In the statistical analysis, Pearson's correlation coefficients and stepwise multiple regression analysis with backward elimination were used.A direct relationship was established between IL-6 and CRP levels (r\u202f=\u202f0.639; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Moreover, IL-6 significantly and positively correlated with hip and neck circumferences, BMI, BFMI, and BAI, as well as with VFR (r range 0.597\u20130.704; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The multiple regression analysis for IL-6 showed that the neck circumference was the only statistically significant independent variable (r2\u202f=\u202f0.496; p\u202f<\u202f0.05; SEE\u202f=\u202f0.554\u202fpg/ml).The results suggest that of all popular indices of adiposity neck circumference is the best predictor of serum IL-6 concentration in the oldest old women without inflammation.",

The current study tested the hypothesis that CAD severity and CSM Ca2+ dysregulation were different in MetS-induced CAD compared to aging-induced CAD.Young (2.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fyears) and old (8.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2\u202fyears) Ossabaw miniature swine were fed an atherogenic diet for 11\u202fmonths to induce MetS and were compared to lean age-matched controls. The metabolic profile was confirmed by body weight, plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, and intravenous glucose tolerance test. CAD was measured with intravascular ultrasound and histology. Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was assessed with fura-2 imaging.CAD severity was similar between MetS young and lean old swine, with MetS old swine exhibiting the most severe CAD. Compared to CSM [Ca2+]i handling in lean young, the MetS young and lean old swine exhibited increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store release, increased Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and attenuated sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase activity. MetS old and MetS young swine had similar Ca2+ dysregulation.Ca2+ dysregulation, mainly the SR Ca2+ store, in CSM is more pronounced in lean old swine, which is indicative of mild, proliferative CAD. MetS old and MetS young swine exhibit Ca2+ dysfunction that is typical of late, severe disease. The more advanced, complex plaques in MetS old swine suggest that the \u201caging milieu\u201d potentiates effects of Ca2+ handling dysfunction in CAD.",

     "abstract": "Several biologically active molecules including nutrients can affect the vascular endothelium which becomes dysfunctional and, as a consequence, predisposes to atherosclerosis. However, the impact of the intake of sodium and polyunsaturated fatty acids on carotid atherosclerosis in a population of elderly women has scarcely been studied. Our aim was to investigate the association between carotid intima-media thickness and atherosclerotic plaque and nutrient intake in asymptomatic elderly women. Carotid atherosclerosis was determined by duplex ultrasound in 108 elderly women. Dietary intake was assessed by a combination of a 24-hour recall and a 7-day food record. A physical examination and laboratory tests were performed. We found an association between the C-IMT and polyunsaturated fatty acid (negative, B\u202f=\u202f\u22120.014; p\u202f=\u202f0.03; CI \u22120.027/\u22120.001) and sodium (positive, r\u202f=\u202f0.16; P\u202f=\u202f0.09) intake. When linoleic acid was added to the multivariable regression analysis instead of polyunsaturated fatty acids, C-IMT was associated with linoleic acid (B\u202f=\u202f\u22120.017; p\u202f=\u202f0.02; CI \u22120.032/\u22120.003). In normotensive women we found a positive association between the C-IMT and sodium intake. The atherosclerotic plaque prevalence increased with the increase in sodium intake (66% vs 90% Tertile I vs Tertile III; p\u202f=\u202f0.02). Iin conclusion, A low salt diet to a level of about 1.5\u202fg/d and a polyunsaturated fatty acid intake of >9\u202fg/d were found to be associate with a low atherosclerotic plaque prevalence in an elderly female population. Sodium and polyunsaturated fatty acids-mediated functional changes of the carotid endothelium may be implicated in atherosclerosis development.",

Moreover, the increase in plantar flexor strength was only observed at Week 7.

The present study revealed the effects of Nmnat on aging of Drosophila and uncovered its underlying mechanism. Therefore, the overexpression of Nmnat was established by arm/Gal4 system in Drosophila with an aim to determine the functions of Nmnat during aging process. In this study, our results showed Nmnat was a positive factor on lifespan and movement capacity, which was consistent on d-galactose induced aging acceleration. Further investigation showed that oxidative stress biomarkers, longevity gene, mitochondria related genes and ATP levels were significantly improved in the Nmnat overexpression Drosophila, which suggested that the underlying mechanism of Nmnat on aging process and movement capacity was partly due to its anti-oxidative stress and mitochondrial-protection function. In addition, on H2O2 challenge tests, Nmnat overexpression was sufficient to increase the survival time and movement capacity of Drosophila, which was probably due to its protection against oxidative stress. On rotenone induced mitochondrial dysfunction, Nmnat overexpression also showed better health span and movement capacity than the control group. Based on these data, Nmnat may be a new molecular target to improve health span by enhancing stress resistance and locomotor activity in aging process.",

     "abstract": "The actual mechanisms leading to a reduced muscle power and functional ability in older adults are poorly understood. We investigated the association between different force-velocity (F-V) profiles and impaired muscle power, physical and cognitive function, frailty, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older people.Physical function (habitual gait speed, timed up-and-go test, sit-to-stand and stair-climbing ability), cognitive function, HRQoL and frailty were evaluated in 31 older subjects (70\u201385\u202fyears). The F-V relationship and maximal muscle power (Pmax) were assessed in the leg press exercise. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) and fat index, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time were obtained from DXA scans and accelerometry, respectively.While some subjects showed a force deficit (FDEF), others presented a velocity deficit (VDEF), both leading to an impaired muscle power [Effect size (ES)\u202f=\u202f1.30\u20131.44], and to a likely-very likely moderate harmful effect in their physical and cognitive function, HRQoL and frailty levels (except the VDEF group for cognitive function) [ES\u202f=\u202f0.76\u20131.05]. Leg muscle mass and specific force were similarly associated with force at Pmax, while MVPA but not sedentary time was related to fat index, force at Pmax, and power values (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). A trend was found for the negative association between fat index and relative Pmax (p\u202f=\u202f0.075).Older subjects exhibited different mechanisms (force vs. velocity deficits) leading to impaired muscle power. Both deficits were associated with a lower physical function and quality of life, and a higher frailty, whereas only a force deficit was associated with a lower cognitive function. Interventions aimed at reversing age- and/or disuse-related impairments of muscle power might evaluate the specific responsible mechanism and act accordingly.",

     "abstract": "We recently reported that in addition to its classical cytoplasmic location, the fast skeletal muscle Troponin T3 (TnT3) shuttles to the nucleus, where it appears to perform nonclassical transcription regulatory functions. Importantly, changes in the composition of the nucleus-localized pool of TnT3 and its fragments contribute to age-dependent muscle damage and wasting. Here, using ChIP-Seq, we demonstrate that TnT3 associates with DNA consensus sequences including the TGCCT motif, which is required for p53 binding to the promoter area of p53-related genes. Gene set enrichment analysis further demonstrated that the p53 pathway was the most significantly enriched pathway among genes annotated to the TnT3 ChIP-Seq peaks. We further demonstrated a strong correlation (r\u202f=\u202f0.78, P\u202f=\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124) between the expression levels of TNNT3 and TP53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2B (RRM2B) in skeletal muscle tissue of 21 lean non-diabetic human subjects and a significant (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) reduction in the levels of both gene transcripts in the third age-tertile group [42.3\u201370\u202fyears of age (yoa)] as compared to the second age-tertile (31.3\u201342.3\u202fyoa). Of note, both TNNT3 and RRM2B expression levels negatively associated with total body fat mass (each with r\u202f=\u202f0.49, P\u202f<\u202f0.05), whereas RRM2B positively correlated with pancreatic \u03b2 cell function (rRRM2B~HOMA-B\u202f=\u202f0.47, P\u202f=\u202f0.047). This work suggests that reduced TNNT3 gene expression is another mechanism leading to reduced TnT3 and excitation-contraction coupling with aging. Consequently, TnT3 appears to contribute to age-related sarcopenia and possibly other age-related deficiencies such as muscle insulin resistance and \u03b2 cell dysfunction by interacting with TnT3-binding sequences in the promoter area of p53-related genes, among others, and consequently modulating the transcriptional regulation of these target genes.",

Mechanisms by which aging alters monocyte function are unknown, but recent research suggests that the balance of metabolic processes determine immune cell phenotype and function. Given the known association between aging and mitochondrial dysfunction in other tissues, we hypothesized that aging would impair mitochondrial function in monocytes. To test this, we isolated classical monocytes from young and older adults and tested mitochondrial function by a Seahorse assay. Aging reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and spare capacity in monocytes. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a potential mechanism by which aging alters monocyte phenotype and may impair inflammatory functions, especially in low-glucose environments where oxidative metabolism is necessary to meet energy demands.",

In this study, we directly observed whether a DR of 30% for 6\u00a0months in aged rats could retard SASP by delaying the progression of DNA damage and also found the specific mechanism. The results revealed that a 30% DR could significantly improve renal pathology and some metabolic characteristics. The biomarkers and products of DNA damage were decreased in the process of renal aging on a 30% DR. A series of SASP, notably cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor, were obviously reduced by DR during renal aging. The phosphorylation levels of NF-\u03baB and I\u03baB\u03b1 in aged kidneys of DR group were markedly reduced. These findings suggest that a 30% DR for 6\u00a0months can delay renal aging and reduce the accumulation of SASP by retarding the progression of DNA damage and decreasing the transcription activity of NF-\u03baB, thus providing a target to delay renal aging.",

     "abstract": "Recent studies have shown contradictory associations between calcium levels and health outcomes. We suspected these conflicting results were the consequence of more general issues with how biomarkers are analyzed in epidemiological studies, particularly in the context of aging. To demonstrate the risks of typical analyses, we used three longitudinal aging cohort studies and their demographic subsets to analyze how calcium levels change with age and predict risk of mortality and frailty. We show that calcium levels either increase or decrease with age depending on the population, and positively or negatively predict frailty depending on the population and analysis; both age and frailty results showed substantial heterogeneity. Mortality analyses revealed few significant associations but were likely underpowered. Variation in population composition (demographics, diseases, diet, etc.) leads to contradictory findings in the literature for calcium and likely for other biomarkers. Epidemiological studies of biomarkers are particularly sensitive to population composition both because biomarkers generally have non-linear and often non-monotonic relationships with other key variables, notably age and health outcomes, and because there is strong interdependence among biomarkers, which are integrated into complex regulatory networks. Consequently, most biomarkers have multiple physiological roles and are implicated in multiple pathologies. We argue that epidemiological studies of aging using biomarkers must account for these factors, and suggest methods to do this.",

Ketone bodies, mainly \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, are the primary alternative brain fuel to glucose. Some reports suggest that brain ketone metabolism is unchanged in AD but, to our knowledge, no such data are available for MCI.To compare brain energy metabolism (glucose and acetoacetate) and some brain morphological characteristics in cognitively healthy older adult controls (CTL), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD.24 CTL, 20 MCI and 19\u00a0AD of similar age and metabolic phenotype underwent a dual-tracer PET and MRI protocol. The uptake rate constants and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (KGlu, CMRGlu) and acetoacetate (KAcAc, CMRAcAc) were evaluated with PET using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG), a glucose analogue, and [11C]-acetoacetate ([11C]-AcAc), a ketone PET tracer. Regional brain volume and cortical thickness were evaluated by T1-weighted MRI.In AD compared to CTL, CMRGlu was ~\u00a011% lower in the frontal, parietal, temporal lobes and in the cingulate gyrus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). KGlu was ~\u00a015% lower in these same regions and also in subcortical regions. In MCI compared to CTL, ~\u00a07% glucose hypometabolism was present in the cingulate gyrus. Neither regional nor whole brain CMRAcAc or KAcAc were significantly different between CTL and MCI or AD. Reduced gray matter volume and cortical thinning were widespread in AD compared to CTL, whereas, in MCI compared to CTL, volumes were reduced only in the temporal cortex and cortical thinning was most apparent in temporal and cingulate regions.This quantitative kinetic PET and MRI imaging protocol for brain glucose and acetoacetate metabolism confirms that the brain undergoes structural atrophy and lower brain energy metabolism in MCI and AD and demonstrates that the deterioration in brain energy metabolism is specific to glucose. These results suggest that a ketogenic intervention to increase energy availability for the brain is warranted in an attempt to delay further cognitive decline by compensating for the brain glucose deficit in MCI and AD.",

Although aging is the most important risk factor for cancer, most pre-clinical cancer immunotherapy studies are undertaken in young hosts.

Declining T cell function with age can impede efficacy of age-related cancer immunotherapies, but examples of successful approaches to breach this barrier have been reported. It is further recognized now that immune functions with age do not simply decline, but that they change in potentially detrimental ways. For example, detrimental immune cell populations can become predominant during aging (notably pro-inflammatory cells), the prevalence or function of suppressive cells can increase (notably myeloid derived suppressor cells), drugs can have age-specific effects on immune cells, and attributes of the aged microenvironment can impede or subvert immunity. Key advances in these and related areas will be reviewed as they pertain to cancer immunotherapy in the aged, and areas requiring additional study and some speculations on future research directions will be addressed.

Infiltrating macrophages in skeletal muscle during a period of physical inactivity and subsequent reloading/rehabilitation in older adults is unknown, but may provide insight into mechanisms related to the development of metabolic disease and changes in muscle cell size. The purpose of this study was to determine if skeletal muscle macrophage infiltration is modulated differently between young and older adults after bed rest and exercise rehabilitation and if these responses are related to muscle and insulin sensitivity changes. 14 young and 9 older adults underwent 5-days of bed rest followed by 8-weeks of lower limb eccentric exercise rehabilitation (REHAB). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance imaging and myofiber analysis were used to identify muscle morphology and CLIX-IR and CLIX-\u03b2 were used to assess insulin sensitivity. Skeletal muscle macrophages, CD68 (pan), CD11b (M1), CD163 (M2), CD206 (M2), were characterized using immunohistochemistry and gene expression. Insulin sensitivity, independent of age, decreased ~\u00a038% following bed rest and was restored following REHAB. We found robust age-related differences in muscle atrophy during bed rest, yet older and younger adults equally hypertrophied during REHAB. Interestingly, there were age-related differences in macrophage content (CD68+\u00a0CD11b+ and CD68+\u00a0CD11b\u2212 cells) but both young and old similarly increased macrophages with REHAB. Satellite cell changes during rehab corresponded to macrophage content changes.

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases. The exact cause of the disease is still not known although many scientists believe in the beta amyloid hypothesis which states that the accumulation of the amyloid peptide beta (A\u03b2) in brain is the initial cause which consequently leads to pathological neuroinflammation. However, it was recently shown that A\u03b2 may have an important role in defending the brain against infections. Thus, the balance between positive and negative impact of A\u03b2 may determine disease progression. Microglia in the brain are innate immune cells, and brain-initiated inflammatory responses reflected in the periphery suggests that Alzheimer's disease is to some extent also a systemic inflammatory disease. Greater permeability of the blood brain barrier facilitates the transport of peripheral immune cells to the brain and vice versa so that a vicious circle originating on the periphery may contribute to the development of overt clinical AD. Persistent inflammatory challenges by pathogens in the periphery, increasing with age, may also contribute to the central propagation of the pathological changes seen clinically. Therefore, the activation status of peripheral innate immune cells may represent an early biomarker of the upcoming impact on the brain. The modulation of these cells may thus become a useful mechanism for modifying disease progression.",

     "abstract": "Telomere length and the rate of telomere shortening have been suggested as particularly useful physiological biomarkers of the processes involved in senescent decline of somatic and reproductive function. However, longitudinal data on changes in telomere length across the lifespan are difficult to obtain, particularly for long-lived animals. Quasi-longitudinal studies have been proposed as a method to gain insight into telomere dynamics in long-lived species. In this method, minimally replicative cells are used as the baseline telomere length against which telomere length in highly replicative cells (which represent the current state) can be compared. Here we test the assumptions and predictions of the quasi-longitudinal approach using longitudinal telomere data in a wild cooperative mammal, the banded mongoose, Mungos mungo. Contrary to our prediction, telomere length (TL) was longer in leukocytes than in ear cartilage. Longitudinally, the TL of ear cartilage shortened with age, but there was no change in the TL of leukocytes, and we also observed many individuals in which TL increased rather than decreased with age. Leukocyte TL but not cartilage TL was a predictor of total lifespan, while neither predicted post-sampling survival. Our data do not support the hypothesis that cross-tissue comparison in TL can act as a quasi-longitudinal marker of senescence. Rather, our results suggest that telomere dynamics in banded mongooses are more complex than is typically assumed, and that longitudinal studies across whole life spans are required to elucidate the link between telomere dynamics and senescence in natural populations.",

We constructed weighted polygenic scores based on genetic markers from previously reported genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects. To avoid false positive due to potential pleiotropic effects of the genetic markers, we performed a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and an MR-Egger sensitivity analysis that we expanded in the survival context.Our results show that elevated BMI increases the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (p\u00a0=\u00a07.68e\u00a0\u2212\u00a004), heart failure (p\u00a0=\u00a09.03e\u00a0\u2212\u00a003), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (p\u00a0=\u00a01.69e\u00a0\u2212\u00a003) and the causal effects start at different ages. A significant association between BMI and the risk of stroke is observed; however, the sensitivity analyses suggest that the association is attributed to the potential pleiotropic effects of rs2867125 and rs1558902. Raised SBP levels are significantly associated with the development of atrial fibrillation (p\u00a0=\u00a06.42e\u00a0\u2212\u00a003). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are inversely associated with the age-at-onset of T2D (p\u00a0=\u00a01.05e\u00a0\u2212\u00a002). In addition, LDL-C and triglycerides are inversely associated with the risks of cancer and T2D, respectively. Nevertheless, the sensitivity analyses suggest that these associations are probably due to pleiotropic effects of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms including rs4970834 and rs1260326.Our results highlight the involvement of BMI in the development of multiple age-related diseases. Some observed causal associations can attribute to pleiotropic effects of some genetic variations. These findings have important implications in unraveling causal effects of common risk factors on age-related diseases and guiding effective intervention strategies to reduce the incidence of these diseases.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. As importantly, they are key in several anabolic processes, including amino acid biosynthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis, heme biosynthesis, and the formation of iron\u2011sulfur clusters. Mitochondria are also engaged in waste removal in the urea cycle. Their activity can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species which have damaging effects in the cell. These organelles are dynamic, undergoing cycles of fission and fusion which can be coupled to their removal by mitophagy. In addition to these widely recognized processes, mitochondria communicate with other subcellular compartments. Various components of mitochondrial complexes are encoded by either the nuclear or the mitochondrial genome necessitating coordination between these two organelles. This article reviews another form of communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus, in which the dysfunction of the former triggers changes in the expression of nuclear genes to compensate for it. The most extensively studied of these signaling pathways is the retrograde response whose effectors and downstream targets have been characterized. This response extends yeast replicative lifespan by adapting the organism to the mitochondrial dysfunction. Similar responses have been found in several other organisms, including mammals. Declining health and function during human aging incurs energetic costs. This compensation plays out differently in males and females, and variation in nuclear genes whose products affect mitochondrial function influences the outcome. Thus, the theme of mitochondria-nucleus communication as an adaptive response during aging appears very widespread.",

Only simultaneous physical-cognitive training enhances performance in daily life tasks. Three months after the intervention, these improvements were generally maintained for physical functions and attention and were not maintained for the postural performances in daily life task. In conclusion, physical training improves postural balance, mobility, attention and physical functions in older adults. Only simultaneous physical-cognitive training modality enhances performance in some tasks relative to every day abilities. Nonetheless, these gains were lost after 3 months of detraining period suggesting a need for older people to participate regularly in such training for their daily life independence.",

Both antibody and cell-mediated immunity plays a prominent role in protecting older adults, particularly against the serious complications of influenza. High dose (HD) influenza vaccines induce higher antibody titers in older adults compared to standard dose (SD) vaccines, yet its impact on T-cell memory is not clear.The aim of this study was to compare the antibody and T-cell responses in older adults randomized to receive HD or SD influenza vaccine as well as determine whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus affects the response to vaccination, and identify differences in the response to vaccination in those older adults who subsequently have an influenza infection.Older adults (\u2265\u00a065\u00a0years) were enrolled (n\u00a0=\u00a0106) and randomized to receive SD or HD influenza vaccine. Blood was collected pre-vaccination, followed by 4, 10 and 20\u00a0weeks post-vaccination. Serum antibody titers, as well as levels of inducible granzyme B (iGrB) and cytokines were measured in PBMCs challenged ex vivo with live influenza virus. Surveillance conducted during the influenza season identified those with laboratory confirmed influenza illness or infection.HD influenza vaccination induced a high antibody titer and IL-10 response, and a short-lived increase in Th1 responses (IFN-\u03b3 and iGrB) compared to SD vaccination in PBMCs challenged ex vivo with live influenza virus. Of the older adults who became infected with influenza, a high IL-10 and iGrB response in virus-challenged cells was observed post-infection (week 10 to 20), as well as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 at week 20. Additionally, CMV seropositive older adults had an impaired iGrB response to influenza virus-challenge, regardless of vaccine dose.This study illustrates that HD influenza vaccines have little impact on the development of functional T-cell memory in older adults. Furthermore, poor outcomes of influenza infection in older adults may be due to a strong IL-10 response to influenza following vaccination, and persistent CMV infection.",

Until the last couple of decades, aging was viewed as an inevitable process of damage accumulation and not a subject for scientific pursuit. This view changed when it was demonstrated that the aging process is in fact malleable and genetically determined: mutations in single genes can have dramatic effects on longevity. Despite the rapid advancement of our knowledge about aging, the cause of aging remains unclear. In this paper, experiments demonstrating the roles of genetics and epigenetics in modulating longevity are reviewed, concluding with a new model of aging. This genetic switch model of aging proposes that aging is caused by a genetically-programmed turning off of survival and maintenance pathways after reproduction finishes leading to a progressive functional decline. If this model is correct, it may be possible to extend lifespan and healthspan by identifying the molecular pathways involved and simply turning the switch back on.",

     "abstract": "Despite evident success in clarifying many important features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) the efficient methods of its prevention and treatment are not yet available. The reasons are likely to be the fact that AD is a multifactorial and heterogeneous health disorder with multiple alternative pathways of disease development and progression. The availability of genetic data on individuals participated in longitudinal studies of aging health and longevity, as well as on participants of cross-sectional case-control studies allow for investigating genetic and non-genetic connections with AD and to link the results of these analyses with research findings obtained in clinical, experimental, and molecular biological studies of this health disorder. The objective of this paper is to perform GWAS of AD in several study populations and investigate possible roles of detected genetic factors in developing AD hallmarks and in other health disorders. The data collected in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study (LOADFS) were used in these analyses. The logistic regression and Cox's regression were used as statistical models in GWAS. The results of analyses confirmed strong associations of genetic variants from well-known genes APOE, TOMM40, PVRL2 (NECTIN2), and APOC1 with AD. Possible roles of these genes in pathological mechanisms resulting in development of hallmarks of AD are described. Many genes whose connection with AD was detected in other studies showed nominally significant associations with this health disorder in our study. The evidence on genetic connections between AD and vulnerability to infection, as well as between AD and other health disorders, such as cancer and type 2 diabetes, were investigated. The progress in uncovering hidden heterogeneity in AD would be substantially facilitated if common mechanisms involved in development of AD, its hallmarks, and AD related chronic conditions were investigated in their mutual connection.",

     "abstract": "Cellular life depends mostly on the creation, modification, interactions and destruction of proteins. This is true for every cell, including human T lymphocytes. One way these cells can ascertain the fidelity and at least partial functionality of their proteomes under constant attack of irreversible modulations (e.g., ROS- or glycation-dependent) is proteostasis. However, with cellular aging proteostasis progressively fails and proteostenosis (decreased amounts and functionalities of remaining proteins) occurs. There are several mechanisms involved in the modulation and protection of the proteome in the T cells which include mainly multiple layers of vesicle-bound and cytoplasmic proteases (e.g., lysosomal and proteasomal ones) acting mostly by degradation of obsolete and age-modified proteins. Recently it was shown that another not yet so widely known system consisting of obligatorily calcium-dependent cysteine proteases, the calpains and their inhibitor, the calpastatin serves in T cells as a dual switch, either activating or inactivating different proteins depending on intracellular conditions. Thus the proteolytic elimination of altered proteins as well as modulation of activity of those remaining leads to dynamic change of proteome composition and function (proteodynamics) in aging lymphocytes, so far in an almost unknown way. Aging T cell proteodynamics requires further comprehensive analysis of the resulting lysoproteomic patterns and their changes.",

After exposure to UVB irradiation, collagen degradation is accelerated by upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and collagen synthesis is decreased via downregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 signaling. Borago officinalis L. (BO) is an annual herb with medicinal and culinary applications. Although BO has been demonstrated to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, its potential anti-photoaging effects have not been examined. In this study, we examined the protective effects of BO against skin photodamage in UVB-exposed normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) in vitro and hairless mice in vivo. BO downregulated the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, and IL-6, and enhanced TGF-\u03b21 by modulating activator protein (AP-1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) signaling in UVB-irradiated NHDFs. We also found that dietary BO reduced wrinkle formation, epidermal thickness, and erythema in UVB-exposed skin. Moreover, skin hydration and collagen synthesis were improved by dietary BO treatment. Our results demonstrate that BO can be used in functional foods, cosmetic products, and medicines for prevention and treatment of UVB-induced skin photodamage.",

The pooled mean difference of telomere length for the non-frail versus frail was 0.06 (95% CI: \u22120.01, 0.13), suggesting that no significant association was found between telomere length and frailty. In addition, the subgroup analysis indicated that telomere length was not significantly associated with the risk of frailty in all gender groups. Similar results were also found when frailty was defined by the Fried criteria (mean difference\u202f=\u202f0.07, 95% CI: \u22120.03, 0.16) and frailty index (mean difference\u202f=\u202f\u22120.02, 95% CI: \u22120.05, 0.01), but not by the frailty scale (mean difference\u202f=\u202f0.18, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.32).Telomere length is not associated with the risk of frailty.

However, it remains elusive whether this mechanism is also applied to the amelioration of normal aging cells. In this study, we used Y-27632 and fasudil as effective ROCK inhibitors, and examined their role in senescence. We found that ROCK inhibition induced the functional recovery of the mitochondria as well as the metabolic reprogramming, which are two salient features that are altered in normal aging cells. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed that the up-regulated pathway upon ROCK inhibition is enriched for chromatin remodeling genes, which may play an important role in the alleviation of senescence-associated cell cycle arrest. Indeed, ROCK inhibition induced cellular proliferation, concomitant with the amelioration of senescent phenotype. Furthermore, the restorative effect by ROCK inhibition was observed in vivo as evidenced by the facilitated cutaneous wound healing. Taken together, our data indicate that ROCK inhibition might be utilized to ameliorate normal aging process and to treat age-related disease.",

It has been reported that sarcopenia can be attenuated by physical exercise. Therefore, we investigated whether 2 different physical exercise protocols could modulate and induce changes in oxidative and inflammatory parameters, as well as in BDNF and DNA repair enzyme levels in skeletal muscle tissue of aged rats. Aging Wistar rats performed treadmill or strength training for 50\u202fmin 3 to 4 times a week for 8\u202fweeks. Strength training decreased 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation (P\u202f=\u202f0.0062); however, nitric oxide, protein deglycase DJ-1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) levels increased after aerobic training (P\u202f=\u202f0.04, P\u202f=\u202f0.027 and P\u202f=\u202f0.009, respectively).

Both age groups performed the same amount of work during LC, with the old group displaying a resistance to LC-induced fatigue during the exercise. Muscle damage was evident by soreness and losses in isokinetic force and power production, though older subjects experienced reduced force and power losses relative to the young group. The acute extracellular matrix (ECM) response was characterized by substantial increases in the glycoproteins tenascin C and fibronectin in the young, which were blunted in the old muscle following damage. Old muscle displayed a generally heightened and asynchronous inflammatory response compared to young muscle, with higher expression of MCP-1 that appeared at later time points, and increased NF-\u03bab activity. Expression of the stress-related MAPKs P38 and JNK increased only in the old groups following muscle damage. In summary, aberrations appear in the inflammatory, ECM and MAPK responses of aged skeletal muscle following damaging LC, each of which may individually or collectively contribute to the deterioration of muscle repair mechanisms that accompanies aging.",

In this study, we examined the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, transcription factors responsible for the regulation of expression of these enzymes, and mitochondrial proteins in the liver of SAMP10 and SAMR1 mice at 3 and 12\u202fmonths of age using western blotting analysis. To investigate the amount of oxidative damage to DNA, levels of 8-OHdG were measured in the liver of these mice. At 3\u202fmonths of age, the levels of catalase, Mn-SOD, GPx, UQCRC2 and COXIV were significantly upregulated in SAMP10 mice compared with that in SAMR1 mice. However, NDUFS3 levels were not significantly different at this young age. In contrast, the expression level of catalase was significantly lower, and the levels of phosphorylated FoxO-1a and UQCRC2 were significantly higher in SAMP10 mice compared to those in SAMR1 mice; however, at 12\u202fmonths of age, there were no significant differences in Mn-SOD, GPx, total -FoxO-1a, COXIV, and NDUFS3 expression between the two groups of mice. The levels of 8-OHdG in the liver were markedly higher in 12-month-old SAMP10 mice than those in 3-month-old SAMP10 and SAMR1 mice. These results suggest that an increase in number of mitochondria or a collapse in the balance between the levels of complexes I and III results in an increase in the amount of ROS and induces the expression of antioxidant enzymes in the liver of SAMP10 mice at 3\u202fmonths of age. Although young SAMP10 mice produce a large amount of ROS, they also produce suitable levels of antioxidant enzymes that decompose ROS; consequently accelerated aging does not occur in young SAMP10 mice. In addition to excessive ROS production which is an important cause of aging, the level of catalase was significantly lower in SAMP10 than that in SAMR1 mice. These results suggested that overexpression of ROS and a decrease in the levels of catalase resulted in the accelerated aging observed in older SAMP10 mice. Moreover, the level of phosphorylated FoxO-1a was increased in SAMP10 compared to that in SAMR1 mice though the total amount of FoxO-1a was not significantly different between the two groups in old age. These results suggest that some impairment in the regulation mechanism of FoxO-1a phosphorylation is responsible for abnormal catalase expression and that a significant decrease in the level of catalase with aging decisively affects the metabolic balance of ROS; thus, ROS that cannot be metabolized contributes to the accelerated aging of SAMP10 mice.",

At baseline, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were strongly correlated (r\u202f=\u202f0.62, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Total IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 decreased across age, while the ratio of IGF-1/IGFBP-3 increased across age. This pattern was consistent across ages at baseline and intra-individually over an average 2.3\u202fyears follow-up (range\u202f=\u202f10\u202fmonths\u20135.6\u202fyears). In age-adjusted linear regression models, baseline levels of total IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 varied by participant characteristics (sex, BMI, gait speed), medical comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index score, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), and hormone replacement therapy use in women. High interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) suggest little intra-individual variability in levels of total IGF-1 (ICC\u202f=\u202f0.84), IGFBP-3 (ICC\u202f=\u202f0.88), and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 (ICC\u202f=\u202f0.81) over time. In mixed effects models that specified age as a time scale, men showed greater decreases in total IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 with age, while more comorbidities and decreasing gait speed were associated with increasing IGFBP-3. In sex-stratified models, trajectories of total IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and IGF-1/IGFBP-3, as a function of participant demographics, health characteristics, and medical conditions, differed between men and women. These results suggest that change in levels of plasma total IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 are associated with demographics, health characteristics, and medical conditions, and that the trajectories of change differ by sex. Future research should consider how IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 might be useful in research or clinic, paying particular attention to how sex may impact levels as a function of demographics, health characteristics, and medical conditions.",

Twenty young (25.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.1\u202fyrs) and 20 older adults (68.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.4\u202fyrs) ascended and descended a 3-step staircase with no simultaneous cognitive task (single-motor task) or while performing a cognitive task (dual-task condition). The cognitive task involved either 1) recalling a word list of the subject's word-span minus 2 words (SPAN-2) to assess the attention division effect, 2) a word list of subject's word-span (SPAN-O) to assess the working memory effect, or 3) recalling in alphabetical order, a word list of the subject's word-span (SPAN-A) to assess the executive function effect. Word-span corresponds to the longest string of words that can be recalled correctly. The duration of ascent and descent of stairs was used to assess the cognitive-motor interaction.Stair ascent and descent duration did not differ between age groups for the single-motor task, and was similar between single-motor task and SPAN-2 in both groups (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). In contrast, stair ascent and descent duration increased with SPAN-O compared with SPAN-2 for both groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Stair ascent (p\u202f=\u202f0.017) and descent (p\u202f=\u202f0.008) were longer in SPAN-A than SPAN-O only in older adults.Healthy aging was not associated with a decrease in the capacity to perform motor-cognitive dual tasks that involved ascending and descending of stairs when the cognitive task only required working memory. However, the decrease in dual-task performance involving executive functioning may reflect a subclinical cognitive decline in healthy older adults.",

Dysregulated blood pressure (BP) behaviour including orthostatic hypertension (OHTN), hypotension (OH) and BP variability (BPV) are associated with end-organ damage, particularly in the brain. We investigated if abnormal orthostatic BP (OBP) was a risk factor for AMD, for which a vascular aetiology is implicated.A nationally representative, cross-sectional study was carried out 2009/2010 in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Beat-to-beat BP data, measured by digital photoplethysmography during active stand, was used to characterise OBP behaviour in the 30\u2013110\u202fs after standing. OH, OHTN, BPV and normal stabilisation recovery phenotypes were defined. AMD was identified following masked grading of 45\u00b0 monoscopic colour retinal photographs, which were centred on the macula and taken with a NIDEK AFC-210 non-mydriatic auto-fundus camera. The relationship between OBP recovery phenotypes and AMD in 3750 adults aged \u226550\u202fyears was investigated using multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for traditional AMD risk factors.From 30 to 110\u202fs post active stand, systolic and diastolic OHTN was associated with increased odds of AMD after adjustment for demographics, health behaviours including smoking, family history of AMD, self-report (SR) diabetes, SR cataracts, objective hypertension and prescribed antihypertensives. No evidence of heterogeneity of OHTN effect was found between those who were hypertensive to those who were normotensive.This study provides evidence that OHTN may be an independent cardiovascular risk factor for AMD.",

     "abstract": "Due to immunosenescence, older adults are particularly susceptible to lung-based viral infections, with increased severity of symptoms in those with underlying chronic lung disease. Repeated respiratory viral infections produce lung maladaptations, accelerating pulmonary dysfunction. Toll like 3 receptor (TLR3) is a membrane protein that senses exogenous double-stranded RNA to activate the innate immune response to a viral infection. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] mimics double stranded RNA and has been shown to activate TLR3. Utilizing an established mouse viral exacerbation model produced by repetitive intranasal poly(I:C) administration, we sought to determine whether repetitive poly(I:C) treatment induced negative muscle adaptations (i.e. atrophy, weakness, and loss of function). We determined skeletal muscle morphological properties (e.g. fiber-type, fiber cross-sectional area, muscle wet mass, etc.) from a treated group ((poly(I:C), n\u202f=\u202f9) and a sham-treated control group (PBS, n\u202f=\u202f9); age approximately 5\u202fmonths. In a subset (n\u202f=\u202f4 for both groups), we determined in vivo physical function (using grip test for strength, rotarod for overall motor function, and treadmill for endurance) and muscle contractile properties with in vitro physiology (in the EDL, soleus and diaphragm). Our findings demonstrate that poly(I:C)-treated mice exhibit both muscle morphological and functional deficits. Changes of note when comparing poly(I:C)-treated mice to PBS-treated controls include reductions in fiber cross-sectional area (\u221227% gastrocnemius, \u221225% soleus, \u221216% diaphragm), contractile dysfunction (soleus peak tetanic force, \u221226%), muscle mass (gastrocnemius \u221219%, soleus \u221223%), physical function (grip test \u221234%), body mass (\u221220%), and altered oxidative capacity (140% increase in succinate dehydrogenase activity in the diaphragm, but 66% lower in the gastrocnemius). Our data is supportive of a new model of cachexia/sarcopenia that has potential for future research into the mechanisms underlying muscle wasting.",

Three typical clinical symptoms of NPH include gait disturbance, progressive cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. Although there are articles that have discovered several cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein biomarkers associated with NPH; however, studies examining individual and total protein concentrations from the ventricular CSF before and after shunting surgery are lacking. This study used proteomics to calculate the CSF individual and total protein concentrations before, and one week, one month and three months after the shunting surgery. Parameters of cadence, step length, walking speed, and percentages of single- and double-limb support in a gait cycle were measured. Protein concentrations associated with anti-oxidation, aging, and in the prevention of neurotoxic agent production increased by at least 2-folds after the surgery, indicating that the brain may become less susceptible to neurodegeneration. These proteins were alpha-1B-glycoprotein, apolipoproteins A-1 & A-IV, prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and serotransferrin. In gait analysis, lower cadence, decreased double-limb support, longer step length, and increased single-limb support were observed after the surgery, indicating a more stable walking balance. These changes lasted for a period of at least 3\u202fmonths. As a result, shunting surgery may be recommended for geriatric patients with confirmed diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus.",

Current definitions of sarcopenia do not fully encompass the age-related changes in skeletal muscle. We therefore examined the influence of aging and sex on elements of skeletal muscle health using a thorough histopathological analysis of myocellular aging and assessments of neuromuscular performance. Two-hundred and twenty-one untrained males and females were separated into four age cohorts [mean age 25\u202fy (n\u202f=\u202f47), 37\u202fy (n\u202f=\u202f79), 61\u202fy (n\u202f=\u202f51), and 72\u202fy (n\u202f=\u202f44)]. Total (\u221212%), leg (\u221217%), and arm (\u221221%) lean mass were lower in both 61\u202fy and 72\u202fy than in 25\u202fy or 37\u202fy (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Knee extensor strength (\u221234%) and power (\u221243%) were lower (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) in the older two groups, and explosive sit-to-stand power was lower by 37\u202fy (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). At the histological/myocellular level, type IIx atrophy was noted by 37\u202fy and type IIa atrophy by 61\u202fy (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). These effects were driven by females, noted by substantial and progressive type IIa and IIx atrophy across age. Aged female muscle displayed greater within-type myofiber size heterogeneity and marked type I myofiber grouping (~5-fold greater) compared to males. These findings suggest the predominant mechanisms leading to whole muscle atrophy differ between aging males and females: myofiber atrophy in females vs. myofiber loss in males. Future studies will be important to better understand the mechanisms underlying sex differences in myocellular aging and optimize exercise prescriptions and adjunctive treatments to mitigate or reverse age-related changes.",

We hypothesized that reduced deletion mutation abundance may contribute to rapamycin's life extension effects. To test this hypothesis, genetically heterogeneous male and female mice were treated with rapamycin, compounded in chow at 14 or 42\u202fppm, from 9\u202fmonths to 22\u202fmonths of age. Mice under a 40% dietary restriction were included as a control known to protect mtDNA quality. To determine if chronic rapamycin treatment affects mitochondrial DNA quality, we assayed mtDNA deletion frequency and electron transport chain deficient fiber abundances in mouse quadriceps muscle.At 42\u202fppm rapamycin, we observed a 57% decrease in deletion frequency, a 2.8-fold decrease in ETC deficient fibers, and a 3.4-fold increase in the number of mice without electron transport chain deficient fibers. We observed a similar trend with the 14\u202fppm dose. DR significantly decreased ETC deficient fiber abundances with a trend toward lower mtDNA deletion frequency. The effects of rapamycin treatment on mitochondrial DNA quality were greatest in females at the highest dose. Rapamycin treatment at 14\u202fppm did not affect muscle mass or function. Dietary restriction also reduced deletion frequency and ETC deficient fibers. These data support the concept that the lifespan extending effects of rapamycin treatment result from enhanced mitochondrial DNA quality.",

Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to estimate the associations between liver enzymes and the risk of MetS and its components according to quartiles of the concentration of each liver enzyme.The prevalence of MetS and its components increased remarkably with increasing quartiles of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) but not with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the elderly. Compared with subjects in the bottom quartile, the adjusted odds ratio for MetS in the highest ALT, GGT and ALP quartiles were 1.78 (95% CI 1.21\u20132.61), 2.58 (95% CI 1.77\u20133.78) and 1.85 (95%CI 1.27\u20132.70) respectively. No statistically significant increases in the odds ratio for MetS according to increased quartiles of AST were found in either the univariate or multivariate logistic regression analyses.Elevated liver enzymes levels (mainly ALT, GGT and ALP but not AST) are positively associated with the prevalence of MetS in elderly populations.",

Although cognition is among the important components of frailty, there is lack of evidence on the role of specific neuro-cognitive dimensions. The primary aim of the present work was to evaluate the multidimensional definition of frailty, and to assess whether neuro-cognitive function is a constituent of the frailty syndrome among adults aged \u226550\u202fyears living in three European countries. As a secondary aim, the construct validity of the created frailty index was tested (with inpatient and outpatient hospitalization), as well as its determinants.Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, community-based, nationally-representative survey conducted in Finland, Poland and Spain (n\u202f=\u202f7987 individuals aged \u226550\u202fyears). Socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle and social factors were assessed using validated procedures. Cognitive function was assessed with the following tests: learning and short-term memory, working memory and verbal fluency. A frailty index was constructed based on 31 frailty attributes. Principal component analysis was used to identify the components of the frailty index. Logistic and Poisson regression analysis was also conducted.The factor analysis on the components of the index extracted three main dimensions for frailty (disability and daily functioning, cognitive function, chronic health conditions), confirming the multiple dimensions of frailty. Various socio-demographic (e.g., financial status, education level) and lifestyle habits (alcohol consumption) were related with frailty. The presence of frailty was associated with 3.1 times higher odds for inpatient hospitalization (95%CI 2.75 to 3.51). Frailty was also related with higher frequency of outpatient visits.These findings suggest that frailty is a multidimensional concept with three major dimensions. Neuro-congitive function seems to be a separate dimension of the frailty syndrome. Smoking habits and alcohol intake were positively related with frailty while inpatient and outpatient hospitalization were found to be associated to the level of frailty.",

The present study investigated the relative contribution of adaptations in central neural drive and peripheral muscle contractility on changes in isometric muscle strength following short-term unilateral disuse (4\u202fdays, knee brace) and subsequent active recovery (7\u202fdays, one session of resistance training) in young (n\u202f=\u202f11, 24\u202fyrs) and old healthy men (n\u202f=\u202f11, 67\u202fyrs). Maximal isometric knee extensor strength (MVC) (isokinetic dynamometer), voluntary muscle activation (superimposed twitch technique), and electrically evoked muscle twitch force (single and doublet twitch stimulation) were assessed prior to and after disuse, and after recovery. Following disuse, relative decreases in MVC did not differ statistically between old (16.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.7%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and young (\u22129.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.9%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSE), whereas voluntary muscle activation decreased more (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) in old (\u22128.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.5%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) compared to young (\u22121.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0%, ns) as did peak single (\u221225.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.6%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05 vs \u22127.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.3%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and doublet twitch force (\u221223.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.5%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05 vs \u22122.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.6%, ns). All parameters were restored in young following 7\u202fdays recovery, whereas MVC and peak twitch force remained suppressed in old. Regression analysis revealed that disuse-induced changes in MVC relied more on changes in single twitch force in young (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and more on changes in voluntary muscle activation in old (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), whereas recovery-induced changes in MVC mainly were explained by gains in voluntary muscle activation in both young and old. Altogether, the present data demonstrate that plasticity in voluntary muscle activation (~central neural drive) is a dominant mechanism affecting short-term disuse- and recovery-induced changes in muscle strength in older adults.",

In addition, we studied the association between systemic chronic low-grade inflammation and the adaptive response to exercise training.Frail and pre-frail older adults (61 subjects) performed 24\u202fweeks of progressive resistance exercise training.

     "abstract": "A large part of age-related muscle wasting is due to incomplete reinnervation of fibres that have become denervated following motoneuron loss. Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and sodium channel NaV1.5 are considered markers for denervation, but the time course of changes in their expression following denervation has never been systematically evaluated in young-adult and old muscle. To assess the time course of denervation-induced changes in their expression, the left gastrocnemius muscle in 15 young-adult (5-month) and 10 old (25-month) male Wistar rats was denervated for 1, 2 or 4\u202fweeks, while the right muscle served as an internal control. Sections were stained for \u03b1-bungarotoxin, to visualise the neuromuscular junctions, combined with NCAM, polysialylated NCAM (PSA-NCAM) or NaV1.5.In young-adult animals, denervation induced a transient decrease in junctional and cytoplasmic NCAM expression, while in the old NCAM expression was increased after 2\u202fweeks. Cytoplasmic PSA-NCAM was increased in both young-adult and old fibres after 2\u202fweeks denervation with a further increase after 4\u202fweeks in the young only. The junctional PSA-NCAM was transiently increased or decreased in the young and old muscles, respectively. NaV1.5 expression decreased after 1 and 2\u202fweeks of denervation in NaV1.5 in young muscle fibres before returning to control levels, whereas old muscle fibres displayed a transient increase after 1\u202fweek followed by a decrease and a return to control levels after 2 and 4\u202fweeks respectively.In conclusion, NCAM and NaV1.5 are not unequivocally elevated with denervation and consequently are not adequate markers of fibre denervation.",

     "abstract": "Denervation leads to significant muscle atrophy, but it is less clear whether 1) loss of capillaries, fibre size and oxidative capacity decline in parallel and 2) the time course of these changes differs between young and old animals. To investigate this, we denervated the left gastrocnemius muscle for 1, 2 or 4\u202fweeks, while the right muscle served as an internal control, in rats that were 5 or 25\u202fmonths old at the end of the experiment. In the fast part of the gastrocnemius muscle, almost all atrophy had occurred after two weeks (42%) of denervation. Even after 4\u202fweeks of denervation, there was no significant reduction in the oxidative capacity of the muscle. Significant capillary loss occurred only after 4\u202fweeks of denervation (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) that lagged behind and was less than proportional to the decrease in fibre size. Consequently, the capillary density was elevated (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). The time course of these morphological changes was similar in the 5- and 25-month-old rats. Comparing these data with those previously published in the soleus muscle from the same animals show that the decrease in oxidative capacity and capillary rarefaction were more pronounced and occurred earlier than in the gastrocnemius muscle, respectively. The time course of capillary loss lagged behind the decrease in fibre size, and combined with the absence of denervation-induced changes in oxidative capacity this resulted in a muscle capillary supply in excess of that expected by the metabolism and fibre size at least during the first 4\u202fweeks after denervation.",

Data from 989 older adults (\u226565\u202fyears old, 61.3% female) from the 2009\u20132010 Chilean Health Survey were analyzed. Physical activity and sitting time were measured using the Global Physical Activity questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed using the modified Mini-Mental State levels Examination. Physical activity levels were categorized as \u201cinactive\u201d (<600 metabolic equivalent value minutes per week) or \u201cactive\u201d (\u2265600 metabolic equivalent value minutes per week). Sitting time was categorized as \u201csedentary\u201d, defined as \u22654\u202fh of reported sitting time per day, or \u201cnon-sedentary\u201d, defined as <4\u202fh. We created the following groups (i) non-sedentary/active; (ii) non-sedentary/inactive; (iii) sedentary/active; and (iv) sedentary/inactive. Hayes's PROCESS macro was used for the simple mediation analysis. Compared with the reference group (individuals classified as non-sedentary/active), older adults who were classified as sedentary/active had elevated odds of cognitive impairment (OR\u202f=\u202f1.90, [95% CI, 1.84 to 3.85]). However, the odds ratio for cognitive impairment was substantially increased in those classified as sedentary/inactive (OR\u202f=\u202f4.85 [95% CI, 2.54 to 6.24]) compared with the reference group. MVPA was found to mediate the relationship between sitting time and cognitive function (Indirect Effect\u202f=\u202f\u22120.070 [95% CI, \u22120.012 to \u22120.004]).Conclusion: The present findings suggest that, whether overall physical activity is high or low, spending large amounts of time sitting is associated with elevated odds of cognitive impairment and that MVPA slightly weakens the relationship between sitting time and cognitive function.",

Participation in walking activity, BMI, metabolic syndrome and its 5 criteria; waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting glucose (FG) levels, triglyceride (TG) levels, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels, were measured.

Exercise training featured an 8\u202fweek program of treadmill running. At the end of the intervention period, neuromuscular function was quantified with ex vivo stimulation procedures on isolated soleus muscles. Morphological adaptations were determined by quantifying myofiber profiles (fiber size and type) of soleus muscles.Ex vivo procedures confirmed that rested (fresh) young muscles were significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) stronger than aged ones. By the end of the 5\u202fmin stimulation protocol, however, young and aged muscles displayed similar levels of strength. Neuromuscular transmission efficacy as assessed by comparing force produced during indirect (neural) and direct (muscle) stimulation was unaffected by aging, or training, but under both conditions significantly declined over the stimulation protocol mimicking declines in strength. Myofiber size was unaffected by age, but training caused reductions in young, but not aged myofibers. Aged solei displayed a higher percentage of Type I fibers, along with a lower percentage of Type II fibers than young muscles.The greater strength of young muscles has a neural, rather than a muscular focal point. The loss of strength discerned over the 5\u202fmin stimulation protocol was linked to similar fatigue-related impairments in neuromuscular transmission. The two components of the neuromuscular system, i.e. nerves and muscles, do not respond in concert to the stimulus of either aging, or exercise training.",

It contains shikimic acid, soluble fibre and various phenolic acids including p-hydroxybenzoic acid and three caffeoylshikimic acid isomers. PFJ has also demonstrated beneficial health properties in various biological models. Increasing concentrations of PFJ and different PFJ fractions were used to assess growth dynamics and possible anti-ageing properties in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) genotype w1118. Microarray gene expression analysis was performed on whole fruit fly larvae and their fat bodies, after the larvae were fed a control Standard Brandeis Diet (SBD) with or without PFJ. Transcripts from Affymetrix GeneChips were utilised to identify the possible mechanisms involved, with genes having fold changes\u202f>\u202f|1.30| and p\u202f<\u202f0.05 considered differentially expressed. PFJ dose-dependently delayed larval growth and pupation, but not percent eclosion from pupae. Eclosed male fruit flies fed PFJ or its fractions during the larval stage tended to have 20\u201340% improved survival ratings over controls when allowed to age on the control diet (SBD). Microarray analysis of whole fruit fly larvae revealed that 127 genes were up-regulated, while 67 were down-regulated by PFJ. Functional analysis revealed transport and metabolic processes were up-regulated, while development and morphogenesis processes, including the nutrient-sensing Tor gene, were down-regulated by PFJ, whereas microarray analysis of larval fat bodies found 161 genes were up-regulated, while 84 genes were down-regulated. Genes involved in defence response and determination of adult lifespan, including those encoding various heat shock proteins and the antioxidant enzyme Sod2, were up-regulated, while cell cycle and growth genes were down-regulated. Thus, PFJ supplementation lengthened the growth stages in fruit fly larvae that was reflected in extended ageing of adult flies, suggesting that larval expression of hormetic stress response genes was linked to subsequent ageing and longevity.",

The question of spatial versus non-spatial sensitivity to age-related memory decline is of importance for a full understanding of these changes. Here, we characterized the effect of normal aging on both non-spatial (object) and spatial (object location) memory performances as well as on associated neuronal activation in mice. Novel-object (NOR) and object-location (OLR) recognition tests, respectively assessing the identity and spatial features of object memory, were examined at different ages. We show that memory performances in both tests were altered by aging as early as 15\u202fmonths of age: NOR memory was partially impaired whereas OLR memory was found to be fully disrupted at 15\u202fmonths of age. Brain activation profiles were assessed for both tests using immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos (neuronal activation marker) in 3and 15\u202fmonth-old mice. Normal performances in NOR task by 3\u202fmonth-old mice were associated to an activation of the hippocampus and a trend towards an activation in the perirhinal cortex, in a way that did significantly differ with 15\u202fmonth-old mice. During OLR task, brain activation took place in the hippocampus in 3\u202fmonth-old but not significantly in 15\u202fmonth-old mice, which were fully impaired at this task. These differential alterations of the object- and object-location recognition memory may be linked to differential alteration of the neuronal networks supporting these tasks.",

     "abstract": "Understanding the influence of strength training intensity on subsequent recovery in elderly is important to avoid reductions in physical function during the days following training. Twenty-two elderly were randomized in two groups: G70 (65.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.8\u202fyears, n\u202f=\u202f11) and G95 (66.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.1, n\u202f=\u202f11). Baseline tests included maximum voluntary isometric contraction (peak torque and rate of torque development - RTD), countermovement jump, and functional capacity (timed up and go, stairs ascent and descent). Then, both groups performed a single strength training session with intensities of 70% (G70) or 95% (G95) of five repetition maximum. The same tests were repeated immediately, 24\u202fh, 48\u202fh, and 72\u202fh after the session. Peak torque was lower than baseline immediately after for both groups and at 24\u202fh for G95. Compared with G70, G95 had lower peak torque at 24\u202fh and 48\u202fh. Countermovement jump, timed up and go, stairs ascent, and RTD at 0\u201350\u202fms only differed from baseline immediately after for both groups. RTD at 0\u2013200\u202fms was lower than baseline immediately after and 24\u202fh after the session for both groups. In conclusion, reduced physical function immediately after strength training can last for 1\u20132\u202fdays in elderly depending on the type of physical function and intensity of training. Higher intensity resulted in greater impairment. Exercise prescription in elderly should take this into account, e.g., by gradually increasing intensity during the first months of strength training. These results have relevance for elderly who have to be fit for work or other activities in the days following strength training.",

It is commonly present in people with dementia but these risks have rarely been studied in this population. We aimed to investigate associations between polypharmacy and emergency department attendance, any and unplanned hospitalisation, and mortality in patients with dementia. Using a large mental health care database in South London, linked to hospitalisation and mortality data, we assembled a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with dementia. We ascertained number of medications prescribed at the time of dementia diagnosis and conducted multivariate Cox regression analyses. Of 4668 patients with dementia identified, 1128 (24.2%) were prescribed 4\u20136 medications and 739 (15.8%) \u22657 medications. Compared to those using 0\u20133 medications, patients with dementia using 4\u20136 or \u22657 agents had an increased risk of emergency department attendance (hazard ratio 1.20/1.35), hospitalisation (hazard ratio 1.12/1.32), unplanned hospital admission (hazard ratio 1.12/1.25), and death within two years (hazard ratio 1.29/1.39) after controlling for potential confounders. We found evidence of a dose response relationship with each additional drug at baseline increasing the risk of emergency department attendance and mortality by 5% and hospitalisation by 3%. In conclusion, polypharmacy at dementia diagnosis is associated with a higher risk of adverse health outcomes. Future research is required to elucidate which specific agents underlie this relationship and if reduction of inappropriate prescribing is effective in preventing these outcomes in dementia.",

     "abstract": "The aging process is driven by interrelated mechanisms that lead to the emergence of characteristic phenotypes that include changes in body composition, energy production and utilization imbalance, homeostatic dysregulation, and neurodegeneration and loss of neuroplasticity. Mainstream theories of aging all recognize that the aging phenotypes result from an imbalance between stressors and stress buffering mechanisms and a resultant loss of compensatory reserve leading to accumulation of unrepaired damage. This in turn results in increased disease susceptibility, reduced functional reserve, reduced healing capacity and stress resistance, unstable health and finally failure to thrive. The resultant physical and cognitive decline that culminates with the frailty syndrome is a tipping point of healthspan and implies a high risk of system decompensation and death. Preserving physical and cognitive function is the main focus of geriatric and gerontological research, but it is important to recognize that accomplishing this goal requires a profound understanding of the molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms that ultimately determine functional changes. In this context, the proinflammatory state of aging plays a major role. Longitudinal studies have shown that with aging most individuals tend to develop a chronic low-grade proinflammatory state, and that such a state is a strong risk factor for multimorbidity, physical and cognitive disability, frailty and death. A number of environmental factors may play an important role in modifying the proinflammatory state. We explore processes and mechanisms of aging that affect human biology and the possible links of inflammation and the environment to aging, especially those related to metabolism. We point out that longitudinal studies with a life course approach are needed to gain further mechanistic insight on the processes that lead to functional decline with aging, and the role played in this process by inflammation and environmental challenges.",

     "abstract": "Life expectancy is continuously increasing due to major progress in preventing, delaying or curing various pathologies normally encountered in old age. However, both scientific and medical advances are still required to understand underlying cause of the disparate comorbidities occurrence with aging. In one hand, aging profoundly impairs the immune system; it is characterized by many changes in haematopoiesis, adaptive and innate systems, associated with pro-inflammatory environment. In another hand, stressful events (acute or chronic) can also impact the immune system through the secretion of hormones, which are also altered with aging. The field of psychoneuroimmunology is now providing evidences that in acute medical conditions, elderly people are not equal in their responses to stressors depending on many extrinsic and intrinsic factors. These parameters could interfere with elderly's ability to mount an effective immune response.The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the literature (from fundamental to clinical observations) to draw a parallel between immune dysregulation caused by stress or by aging. Understanding this entanglement could enable us to target fundamental age-related pathways and thus open new avenues in improving both lifespan and health span.",

Within the realms of aging research, the pursuit of senolytics has taken the field's spotlight, where the clearance of senescent cells has shown to attenuate aspects of age-related disorders. More interestingly, these senolytics have also revealed that these senescent cells, specifically p16Ink4a cells, accumulate within adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, and eye (Baker et al., 2011).

Using aged murine models of infection, our findings demonstrate increased morbidity and mortality in aged mice within 48\u00a0h post-secondary S. pneumoniae infection. Increased susceptibility of aged mice was associated with decreased TLR1, TLR6, and TLR9 mRNA expression and diminished IL1\u03b2 mRNA expression. Examination of NLRP3 inflammasome expression illustrated decreased NLRP3 mRNA expression and decreased IL1\u03b2 production in aged lung in response to secondary S. pneumoniae infection.",

     "abstract": "Elderly residents of long-term care commonly exhibit a number of age-related health deficits, including impaired physical and cognitive function, chronic illnesses, and chronic inflammation. Given our previous data relating the phenotype and function of innate and adaptive leukocytes from the nursing home elderly to chronic conditions and inflammatory biomarkers, we hypothesized that these factors would influence the regulatory programming of immune cells, thereby contributing to immune dysfunction. Since DNA methylation represents both an important regulatory mechanism of cells as well as a biomarker of health and disease, we sought to characterize the methylome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the nursing home elderly (n\u00a0=\u00a023; 82\u201398\u00a0years old, 70% female), and compare these patterns to pathological factors such as dementia, co-morbidity score and frailty, and immune-related factors such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokine levels and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine responsiveness. We show that the most significant changes in DNA methylation levels occurred in relation to co-morbidity score, including one site, cg07725579 (FDR-adjusted p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; closest gene, SIRBP2), and nine DNA methylation regions (Stouffer's p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). DNA methylation age, although not strongly correlated with chronological age, was positively correlated with serum CRP levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), and negatively correlated with vaccine responsiveness (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035). To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to describe associations of DNA methylation patterns with pathological and immune-related factors in residents of long-term care, and may provide important clues pertaining to immune cell dysfunction near the end of life.",

     "abstract": "Inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by rapamycin (RAPA), an FDA-approved immunosuppressive drug used as a clinical therapy to prevent solid organ allograft rejection, enhances longevity in mice. Importantly, RAPA was efficacious even when initiated in relatively old animals, suggesting that mTOR inhibition could potentially slow the progression of aging-associated pathologies in older humans (Harrison et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2011). However, the safety and tolerability of RAPA in older human subjects have not yet been demonstrated. Towards this end, we undertook a placebo-controlled pilot study in 25 generally healthy older adults (aged 70\u201395\u202fyears); subjects were randomized to receive either 1\u202fmg RAPA or placebo daily. Although three subjects withdrew, 11 RAPA and 14 controls completed at least 8\u202fweeks of treatment and were included in the analysis. We monitored for changes that would indicate detrimental effects of RAPA treatment on metabolism, including both standard clinical laboratory assays (CBC, CMP, HbA1c) and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). We also monitored parameters typically associated with aging that could potentially be modified by RAPA; these included cognitive function which was assessed by three different tools: Executive Interview-25 (EXIT25); Saint Louis University Mental Status Exam (SLUMS); and Texas Assessment of Processing Speed (TAPS). In addition, physical performance was measured by handgrip strength and 40-foot timed walks. Lastly, changes in general parameters of healthy immune aging, including serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and blood cell subsets, were assessed. Five subjects reported potential adverse side effects; in the RAPA group, these were limited to facial rash (1 subject), stomatitis (1 subject) and gastrointestinal issues (2 subjects) whereas placebo treated subjects only reported stomatitis (1 subject). Although no other adverse events were reported, statistically significant decrements in several erythrocyte parameters including hemoglobin (HgB) and hematocrit (Hct) as well as in red blood cell count (RBC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were observed in the RAPA-treatment group. None of these changes manifested clinically significant effects during the short duration of this study. Similarly, no changes were noted in any other clinical laboratory, cognitive, physical performance, or self-perceived health status measure over the study period. Immune parameters were largely unchanged as well, possibly due to the advanced ages of the cohort (70\u201393\u202fyears; mean age 80.5). RAPA-associated increases in a myeloid cell subset and in TREGS were detected, but changes in most other PBMC cell subsets were not statistically significant. Importantly, the OGTTs revealed no RAPA-induced change in blood glucose concentration, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. Thus, based on the results of our pilot study, it appears that short-term RAPA treatment can be used safely in older persons who are otherwise healthy; a trial with a larger sample size and longer treatment duration is warranted.",

     "abstract": "Despite increasing longevity, many old people are not in good health. There has been an increase in the prevalence of age-associated multi-morbidity (two or more chronic conditions in the same person). Also, severe infections, such as pneumonia, remain significant causes of mortality and morbidity in this aging group. Many chronic health conditions share risk factors such as increasing age, smoking, a sedentary life style and being part of a lower socioeconomic group. However, despite this, multi-morbidities often co-occur more commonly than would be predicted. This has led to the hypothesis that they share common underlying mechanisms. This is an important concept, for if it were true, treatments could be devised which target these common pathways and improve a number of age-associated health conditions.Many chronic illnesses associated with multi-morbidity and severe infections are characterized by an abnormal and sustained inflammatory response, with neutrophils being key effector cells in the pathological process. Studies have described aberrant neutrophil functions across these conditions, and some have highlighted potential mechanisms for altered cell behaviours which appear shared across disease states. It has been suggested that altered functions may represent neutrophil \u201csenescence\u201d. This review considers how and why neutrophil functions change as the cell ages, and how and why neutrophil functions change as the host ages in health and disease and discusses whether neutrophil functions could be targeted to improve health outcomes in older adults.",

     "abstract": "Aging impairs development of new B cells and diminishes the expression of protective antibodies. Reduced numbers of B cell precursors generally occur in old (~2\u202fyrs.) mice. At the pro-B to pre-B cell transition, the pre-B cell receptor (preBCR) checkpoint directs pre-B cell expansion and selection of the pre-B cell immunoglobulin (Ig) \u03bc heavy chain variable region repertoire. The preBCR is comprised of Ig \u03bc heavy chain + surrogate light chains (SLC; \u03bb5/VpreB). In old B cell precursors, SLC is decreased and fewer pre-B cells form the preBCR. In pro-B cells, SLC is complexed with cadherin 17 to form a \u201cpro-B cell receptor\u201d whose signaling is postulated to increase apoptotic sensitivity. We propose that inflammation in old mice, in part mediated by the age-associated B cells (ABC), promotes apoptosis among pro-B cells, particularly those relatively high in SLC. The remaining pro-B cells, with lower SLC, now generate pre-B cells with limited capacity to form the preBCR. Ig \u03bc heavy chains vary in their capacity to associate with SLC and form the preBCR. We speculate that limited SLC restricts formation of the preBCR to a subset of Ig \u03bc heavy chains. This likely impacts the composition of the antibody repertoire among B cells.",

Although it is well established that immunosenescence has an important role in vaccination response, the molecular pathways underlying this process are largely unknown. Given the importance of epigenetic remodeling in aging, here we analyzed the relationship between responsiveness to influenza vaccination and DNA methylation profiles in healthy subjects of different ages. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 44 subjects (age range: 19\u201390\u202fyears old) immediately before influenza vaccination. Subjects were subsequently classified as responders or non-responders according to hemagglutination inhibition assay 4\u20136\u202fweeks after the vaccination. Baseline whole genome DNA methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analyzed using the Illumina\u00ae Infinium 450\u202fk microarray. Differential methylation analysis between the two groups (responders and non-responders) was performed through an analysis of variance, correcting for age, sex and batch. We identified 83 CpG sites having a nominal p-value <.001 and absolute difference in DNA methylation of at least 0.05 between the two groups. For some CpG sites, we observed age-dependent decrease or increase in methylation, which in some cases was specific for the responders and non-responders groups. Finally, we divided the cohort in two subgroups including younger (age\u202f<\u202f50) and older (age\u202f\u2265\u202f50) subjects and compared DNA methylation between responders and non-responders, correcting for sex and batch in each subgroup. We identified 142 differentially methylated CpG sites in the young subgroup and 305 in the old subgroup, suggesting a larger epigenetic remodeling at older ages. Interestingly, some of the differentially methylated probes mapped in genes involved in immunosenescence (CD40) and in innate immunity responses (CXCL16, ULK1, BCL11B, BTC). In conclusion, the analysis of epigenetic landscape can shed light on the biological basis of vaccine responsiveness during aging, possibly providing new appropriate biomarkers of this process.",

As an alternative, timely vaccinations might be administered at middle-age, before reaching old age. Studies evaluating the immunological fitness of middle-aged adults are warranted. In this study we compared the immunogenicity of a primary meningococcal vaccination in Dutch middle-aged adults with that in adolescents, in order to gain knowledge on the early signs of immune ageing.In this study, we compared the antibody responses after a primary meningococcal vaccination between middle-aged adults (50\u201365\u00a0years of age, N\u00a0=\u00a0204) and adolescents (10\u201315\u00a0years of age, N\u00a0=\u00a0225). Blood samples were taken pre-, as well as 28\u00a0days and 1\u00a0year post-vaccination. Functional antibody titers were measured with the serum bactericidal killing assay using baby rabbit complement (rSBA). Meningococcal polysaccharide (PS) specific IgG and IgM concentrations were determined with a fluorescent bead-based multiplex immunoassay.Lower post-vaccination functional antibody titers against meningococcal group W and Y were observed in the middle-aged adults compared to the adolescents. One year post-vaccination, also a significantly higher proportion of the middle-aged adults possessed an rSBA titer below protection level. A large reduction in post-vaccination IgM concentrations was observed in the middle-aged adults, whereas IgG concentrations were only marginally different between the two age groups.Strong correlations between the post-vaccination rSBA titers and IgM concentrations were found both in the middle-aged adults and the adolescents.Although protective antibody titers were initiated after primary meningococcal vaccination in middle-aged adults, antibody functionality was significantly lower as compared to that in adolescents. This difference was mainly caused by lower IgM responses. Our results indicate early signs of immune ageing in middle-aged adults, which is important knowledge for the development of future vaccine strategies to better protect elderly persons against infectious diseases.",

Vaccines against tetanus and diphtheria are among the most frequently used vaccines worldwide, but various studies in different European countries have shown that protection against tetanus and particularly against diphtheria is unsatisfactory in adults and older persons.In this study we analyzed tetanus- and diphtheria-specific antibody concentrations in 2100 adults of different age from 6 selected European countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland) in order to investigate differences in the level of protection against tetanus and diphtheria across Europe. Our data reveal that tetanus- and diphtheria-specific antibody concentrations vary greatly between countries, which is also reflected in the percentage of persons with antibody concentrations below the protective level (0.1\u00a0IU/ml), which ranged from 2 to 31% percent for tetanus and 28\u201363% for diphtheria. In most countries, tetanus- and diphtheria-specific antibody concentrations decrease with age. This phenomenon is more pronounced in countries with generally low antibody levels, such as Italy, Poland and Greece. Interestingly, tetanus-specific antibody concentrations are generally higher in males than in females, which is probably due to vaccination during their military service or more frequent booster vaccinations after injuries, whereas no gender-related differences were found for diphtheria-specific antibodies.In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the European population is not fully protected against tetanus and diphtheria. Measures to improve protection should include a life-long perspective on vaccination, more education to increase awareness of and compliance with vaccination guidelines, and a harmonization of recommendations and incentives across Europe.",

Inflammation is a common denominator in age-related pathologies, identifying the immune system as a gatekeeper in aging overall. Among immune cells, T cells are long-lived and exposed to intense replication pressure, making them sensitive to aging-related abnormalities. In successful T cell aging, numbers of na\u00efve cells, repertoire diversity and activation thresholds are preserved as long as possible; in maladaptive T cell aging, protective T cell functions decline and pro-inflammatory effector cells are enriched. Here, we review in the model system of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) how maladaptive T cell aging renders the host susceptible to chronic, tissue-damaging inflammation. In T cells from RA patients, known to be about 20\u00a0years pre-aged, three interconnected functional domains are altered: DNA damage repair, metabolic activity generating energy and biosynthetic precursor molecules, and shaping of plasma membranes to promote T cell motility. In each of these domains, key molecules and pathways have now been identified, including the glycolytic enzymes PFKFB3 and G6PD; the DNA repair molecules ATM, DNA-PKcs and MRE11A; and the podosome marker protein TKS5.

Furthermore, it has been established that adaptive immunity is more susceptible to age-related changes than innate immunity.

They are a decreased number of na\u00efve T cells that parallels an increase in memory T cells, mainly in the cytotoxic CD8+ T cell population, which can be subdivided into na\u00efve, central, effector memory and TEMRA cells. The two main T cell properties that are the most affected with aging are the altered clonal expansion and decreased cytokine production, especially IL-2. These T cell functions have been shown to be affected in the early events of signaling. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of age on TCR- and CD28-dependent activation of the downstream signaling effectors Lck, SHP-1, Akt, PI3K p85\u03b1 and mTOR in differentiated subpopulations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Results showed that lymphocytes of elderly subjects were already in an activated state that could not be upregulated by external stimulation. Results also showed that the age-related signal transduction changes were more important than phenotype in the CD4+ and CD8+ T subpopulations. These observations suggested that age-related molecular and biochemical changes have a more significant influence on T cell functions than T cell phenotype.",

     "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has shown remarkable recent progress. Immune checkpoint blocking antibodies have become the most successful anti-cancer agent class ever developed, with six distinct agents approved since 2011 for a wide variety of cancers. Although age is the biggest risk factor for cancer (aside from selected early-onset pediatric cancers), these agents were tested pre-clinically in young hosts, and there is remarkably little published on the effects of host age on treatment outcomes in pre-clinical studies or human clinical trials. The three principal immune checkpoints against which blocking antibodies have been FDA-approved for human use are CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1. We used a mouse model of transplantable, orthotopic B16 melanoma to test age effects of treatments with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies. All three agents were highly effective in treating young tumor-bearing hosts as expected. Anti-PD-L1 as a single agent had no effect on tumor growth in aged hosts, anti-CTLA-4 had detectable, modest effects and anti-PD-1 was essentially as effective in aged as in young hosts, the first single agent we have identified not to lose efficacy with age in this model. Other important differences in young versus aged hosts included lack of anti-CTLA-4-mediated depletion of intratumor regulatory T cells in aged hosts and poorer ability of all three agents to activate T cells in aged versus young hosts. Anti-CTLA-4 efficacy appeared to improve when combined with anti-PD-L1. Regulatory T cell depletion with FDA-approved denileukin diftitox did not improve treatment by any single agent. Aged mice tolerated treatments as well as young mice without obvious toxicities at equivalent doses.",

     "abstract": "The impact of age and aging in the evolution of systemic parasitic infections remains poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review from preclinical models of Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria, sleeping sickness and toxoplasmosis. From a structured and comprehensive search in electronic databases, 29 studies were recovered and included in the review. Beyond the characteristics of the experimental models, parasitological and immunological outcomes, we also discussed the quality of current evidence. Our findings indicated that throughout aging, parasitemia and mortality were consistently reduced in Chagas disease and malaria, but were similar or increased in leishmaniasis and highly variable in toxoplasmosis. While a marked humoral response in older animals was related to the anti-T. cruzi protective phenotype, cellular responses mediated by a polarized Th1 phenotype were associated with a more effective defense against Plasmodium infection. Conversely, in leishmaniasis, severe infections and high mortality rates were potentially related to attenuation of humoral response and an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 phenotypes. Due to the heterogeneous parasitological outcomes and limited immunological data, the role of aging on toxoplasmosis evolution remains unclear. From a detailed description of the methodological bias, more controlled researches could avoid the systematic reproduction of inconsistent and poorly reproducible experimental designs.",

Aging causes phenotypic and functional impairment of NK cells, which diminishes innate immune surveillance, yet the factors that determine the aged NK cell phenotype have not been completely defined. For instance, the genetic basis of the aged NK cell phenotype has not been established, but if determined, could highlight important genetic regulators of NK cells later in life. In this study, we estimated the heritability of splenic NK cell frequencies in aged mice from 15 classical and four wild-derived inbred strains. Our data suggest that frequencies of total (NKp46+CD3\u2212) NK and mature (NKp46+CD3\u2212CD11b+CD27\u2212) NK cells were highly heritable at old age, and that total NK cell frequencies were independent predictors of median strain life spans. Strains with divergent phenotypes were compared to young-adult controls, and trends of age-related NK cell phenotypic alterations were confirmed. Finally, in silico mapping techniques revealed candidate genes associated with the aged NK cell phenotype. To our knowledge, these results are the first to demonstrate the genetic basis of the aged NK cell phenotype and will inform future mechanistic studies of NK cell dysfunction during aging.",

We evaluated the treatment of osteoarthritis by chondrogenically induced ADSCs and BMSCs for a long time functional recovery.Osteoarthritis was induced at the right knee of sheep by complete resection of ACL and medial meniscus. Stem cells from sheep were induced to chondrogenic lineage. Test sheep received 5\u202fmls single doses of 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f107 autologous PKH26-labelled ADSCs or BMSCs, while controls received basal medium.

Immunocytochemistry was positive for these chondrogenic markers. 12\u202fmonths post-treatment, controls scored 4 in most regions using ICRS, while the treated had 8; P\u202f=\u202f.001.

     "abstract": "The age-related loss of muscle mass and function predominantly affect muscles of the lower limbs and have largely been associated with decline in muscle fibre size and number, although the exact mechanisms underlying these losses are poorly understood. In addition, consistent reports that the loss of muscle strength exceeds that which can be explained by declines in muscle mass has widened the search for causes of sarcopenia to include supporting tissues such as the extracellular matrix and tendons. Although the changes to both muscle and tendon with age are well characterised, little work has focused on the interface between these two tissues, the myotendinous junction (MTJ). Given the crucial role for this structure in force transfer between muscle and tendon, we asked whether the myotendinous junction underwent structural changes with age in lower limb muscle. We used whole muscle to assess gross muscle and tendon morphology, and immunohistochemistry to determine fibre and MTJ profile number in young (6\u202fmonths), middle aged (18\u202fmonths) and elderly (24\u202fmonths) C57BL/6 female mice. MTJ length was quantified using serial cross sections of the soleus muscle. We found an apparent 3.5-fold increase in MTJ profiles per cross section with no increase in fibre number in old mice, and found this to be a result of a doubling in length of the MTJ region with age. This coincided with an increase in proximal tendon length (31%), as well as an increase in collagen deposition between 6 and 24-months of age consistent with an expansion of the fibre termination area. These findings uncover a previously undescribed effect of ageing on the MTJ and open up new lines of investigation into the role of this structure in the age-related loss of muscle function.",

Irisin, one of the myokines expressed in the muscles during exercise, is highly associated with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of aquarobic exercises on serum irisin and BDNF levels to help prevent and delay degenerative brain diseases in elderly women.Twenty-six elderly women voluntarily participated in the study (12 in the control group and 14 in the exercise group). The exercise group underwent a 16-week aquarobic exercise program. The irisin and BDNF levels and liver function were measured in both groups: three times in the exercise group and two times in the control group.Significantly higher serum irisin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and BDNF (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) levels in the aquarobic exercise group than in the control group were found after 16\u202fweeks of exercise, and significant interaction effects of irisin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and BDNF (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) were found in both the control and exercise groups.

Falls risk (Z-score) was measured using the Physiological Profile Assessment. Knee pain and dysfunction were assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC). Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was measured using accelerometer. Linear mixed-effect regression models, with adjustment for confounders, were used to estimate the association between physiological falls risk and between-person and within-person effects of PA, 25OHD and WOMAC score.Between-person effects showed that 10-year average physiological falls risk was lower in participants who had a higher 10-year average 25OHD (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.005 per nmol/l, 95% CI: \u22120.008, \u22120.002), log-MVPA (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.16 per minute, 95% CI: \u22120.22, \u22120.10) and lower mean WOMAC score (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.005 per-unit score, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.01). Within-person effects showed that a higher physiological falls risk at any time-point was associated with higher than average WOMAC score (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.002 per-unit score, 95% CI: 0.0003, 0.004) and lower than average log-MVPA (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.15 per minute, 95% CI: \u22120.24, \u22120.06), but not 25OHD, at the same time-point.Having higher WOMAC global score above an individual's average increases the risk of falling, whereas, increasing one's own MVPA level further reduces their risk of falling. The presence of between-person but not within-person associations for 25OHD suggests the former may be confounded by other factors.",

Here, we report the antioxidant activity of recombinant buckwheat Grx (rbGrx) to reduce aging effects in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as well as the mechanism involved. Our results showed that rbGrx beneficially affected the health span of C. elegans, including pharyngeal-pumping rate, locomotion, and lipofuscin accumulation. Furthermore, stress assay showed that rbGrx could extend the lifespan under both oxidative and heat stress. Further studies indicated that the longevity-extending effects of rbGrx could be attributed to its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities. After treatment with rbGrx, SOD activity, CAT activity, GSH content, and GSH/GSSG ratio were increased, while MDA content was decreased, which led to low intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species in C. elegans. Moreover, rbGrx up-regulated hsf-1 mRNA level and could not expand the lifespan of the hsf-1 mutant C. elegans (sy441); however, this had no effect on the transcription of daf-16 and skn-1 and could expand the lifespan of both daf-16 and skn-1 mutants. These results suggested dependency of the rbGrx effect on the heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1) and independency on both DAF-16 and SKN-1. In summary, our results demonstrated the anti-aging activity of rbGrx, which increased resistance to cellular stress and improved the health span of C. elegans.

All women had a similar concentration of vitamin D (above 20\u202fng\u00b7ml\u22121) at baseline. The 12\u202fweeks of NW training was supported by supplementation of vitamin D3 (4000\u202fIU/day). Muscle strength, serum concentrations of myokines (irisin and IL-6), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inflammation marker, glucose, branched amino acids and tryptophan were all assessed at baseline, 1\u202fh after the first single training session and adequately at the end of the training programme. In addition, iron and ferritin were measured. The concentration of vitamin D3 as well as psychological (Quality-of-Life Assessment, The Beck Depression Inventory-2) and cognitive evaluations (D2 test of attention, Trial Making Test A&B) were also performed before and after the 12-week training programme. Data were interpreted using magnitude-based inferences.According to data obtained in this study, regular NW training resulted in improvement of cognitive functions in aged women. These positive changes were accompanied by an increase of irisin and BDNF concentration (adjusted effect moderate and likely). Our data also revealed that observed reductions of glucose and tryptophan concentrations might have positively contributed to the amelioration of cognitive functions. Still, obtained results indicated that it was not the level vitamin D that modulated exercise-induced changes, but rather the long-lasting experience and being more advanced in training.",

     "abstract": "Utilization of high-intensity resistance training to counter age-related sarcopenia is currently debated because of the potential for maladaptation when training design is inappropriate. Training design is problematic because the influence of various loading variables (e.g. contraction mode, repetition number, and training frequency) is still not well characterized at old age. To address this in a precisely controlled manner, we developed a rodent model of high-intensity training consisting of maximally-activated stretch-shortening contractions (SSCs), contractions typical during resistance training. With this model, we determined that at old age, high-repetition SSC training (80 SSCs: 8 sets of 10 repetitions) performed frequently (i.e. 3\u202fdays per week) for 4.5\u202fweeks induced strength deficits with no muscle mass gain while decreasing frequency to 2\u202fdays per week promoted increases in muscle mass and muscle quality (i.e. performance normalized to muscle mass). This finding confirmed the popular notion that decreasing training frequency has a robust effect with age. Meanwhile, the influence of other loading variables remains contentious. The aim of the present study was to assess muscle adaptation following modulation of contraction mode and repetition number during high-intensity SSC training. Muscles of young (3\u202fmonth old) and old (30\u202fmonth old) male rats were exposed to 4.5\u202fweeks of low-repetition static training of 4 (i.e. 4 sets of one repetition) isometric (ISO) contractions 3\u202fdays per week or a more moderate-repetition dynamic training of 40 SSCs (i.e. 4 sets of 10 repetitions) 3\u202fdays per week. For young rats, performance and muscle mass increased regardless of training protocol. For old rats, no muscle mass adaptation was observed for 4 ISO training while 40 SSC training induced muscle mass gain without improvement in muscle quality, an outcome distinct from modulating training frequency. Muscle mass gain for old rats was accompanied by decreased protein levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, a mediator of age-related chronic inflammatory signaling, to young levels. These findings suggest that while dynamic high-intensity training with a moderate number of repetitions has a limited capacity for altering muscle quality, such training is a viable strategy for countering age-related inflammatory signaling and modifying muscle mass.",

     "abstract": "The beneficial actions of caloric restriction (CR) are partially mediated by metabolic remodeling of white adipose tissue (WAT). Recently, we showed that CR enhances de novo fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and mitochondrial biogenesis, particularly in WAT. Here, to better understand the response of WAT to CR, we compare the effects of CR on three WAT depots in rats: retroperitoneal (rWAT), epididymal (eWAT) and subcutaneous (sWAT). Computed tomography and histological analysis showed that CR reduced the volume and average size of rWAT adipocytes. In all WAT depots, CR markedly upregulated the expression of proteins involved in FA biosynthesis in fed rats. In visceral WAT (rWAT and eWAT), hormone-sensitive lipase (lipolytic form) phosphorylation was increased by CR under fed conditions, and decreased by CR under fasted conditions. Conversely, in sWAT, hormone-sensitive lipase phosphorylation was increased by CR under fasted conditions. CR enhanced the effect of feeding on AKT activity in sWAT (indicative of a positive effect on insulin sensitivity) but not in rWAT or eWAT. These data suggest that CR improves lipid metabolism in an insulin signaling-dependent manner in sWAT only. The effects of CR on adipokine (adiponectin and leptin) expression were also different among rWAT, eWAT and sWAT, and CR reduced the gene expression of M2 macrophage markers in rWAT and sWAT, but not in eWAT. We conclude that CR differentially affects the characteristics of WAT depots in rats, including adipocyte size, lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, adipocytokine profile and macrophage infiltration.",

However, the physical capabilities underlying TUG performance are not well elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating a selection of physical capacities underlying TUG performance in community-dwelling older women. Four hundred and sixty-eight apparently healthy older women independent to perform the activities of daily living (mean age: 65.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.0\u202fyears) were recruited from two specialized healthcare centers for older adults to participate in the study. Volunteers had their medical books reviewed and underwent evaluations of anthropometric data as well as physical and functional capacities. Pearson's correlation results indicate that TUG performance was significantly associated with upper (i.e., handgrip strength) and lower (i.e., sit-to-stand) limb muscle strength, balance (i.e., one-leg stand), lower limb muscle power (i.e., countermovement jump), aerobic capacity (i.e., 6-minute walk test), and mobility (i.e., usual and maximal walking speeds). When the analyses were performed based on TUG quartiles, a larger number of physical capabilities were associated with TUG >75% in comparison with TUG <25%. Multiple linear regression results indicate that the variability in TUG (~20%) was explained by lower limb muscle strength (13%) and power (1%), balance (4%), mobility (2%), and aerobic capacity (<1%), even after adjusted by age and age plus body mass index (BMI). However, when TUG results were added as quartiles, a decrease in the impact of physical capacities on TUG performance was determined. As a whole, our findings indicate that the contribution of physical capabilities to TUG performance is altered according to the time taken to perform the test, so that older women in the lower quartiles \u2014 indicating a higher performance \u2014 have an important contribution of lower limb muscle strength, while volunteers in the highest quartile demonstrate a decreased dependence on lower limb muscle strength and an increased contribution of other physical capabilities, such as lower limb muscle power and balance.",

Evidence of sex-related differences in its associations with mental health is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine sex-related differences in cross-sectional and prospective associations between grip strength and depressive symptoms and status. Participants were community dwelling adults (N\u202f=\u202f4505; 56.5% female), aged \u226550\u202fyears. As a measure of muscular strength, grip strength (kg) of the dominant hand was assessed using a hand-held dynamometer at baseline. Participants were divided into sex-specific tertiles. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale assessed depressive symptoms at baseline and two years later; a score of \u226516 defined caseness of depression. Depressive symptoms were significantly higher among females at baseline (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Prospective models were adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, social class, smoking, and health status. Among males, the middle and high strength tertiles were non-significantly associated with 32.9% (p\u202f=\u202f0.21) and 9.9% (p\u202f=\u202f0.74) reduced odds of developing depression, respectively.

     "abstract": "The conserved EGFR pathway is linked with multiple cancers in humans including breast, ovarian, and lung carcinoma. Withanolide A, one of the major withanolidal active compounds isolated from the Withania somnifera, extends lifespan and ameliorates stress resistance in wild-type C. elegans by targeting the Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Up-regulation of IGF1 can transactivate EGFR which inturn reduces longevity and promotes tumor development in an organism. We examined the effects of Withanolide A on the lifespan of a human EGFR-driven C. elegans transgenic model exhibiting the multivulva (Muv) phenotype. The results showed that WA extends the lifespan of both wild human EGFR-driven C. elegans model (human wild-type tyrosine kinase) as well as models bearing single (L858R), and double mutations (T790M-L858R). The lifespan extension observed in these transgenic strains was 20.35, 24.21 and 21.27%, respectively. Moreover, the reduced fat levels were noticed in both wild-type N2 worms and transgenic strains. These observations support the heathspan promoting effect of WA as lipid-rich diet has been reported to promote tumor development. In view of the fact that most of the well known FDA approved drugs such as gefitinib fail to inhibit the EGFR-associated cancers because of these mutations, the present findings show the potential of Withanolide A as a foreseen future nutraceutical to improve the average survival of cancer patients.",

In addition to sperm, males transfer seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) at mating; Sfps are important determinants of male reproductive success. Receipt of Sfps leads to female post-mating changes including physiological changes, and affects sperm competition dynamics. Using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster we studied ageing males' ability to induce female post-mating responses and determined the consequences of male ageing on their reproductive success. We aged males for up to 7\u00a0weeks and assayed their ability to: i) gain a mating, ii) induce egg-laying and produce offspring, iii) prevent females from remating and iv) transfer sperm and elicit storage after a single mating. We found that with increasing age, males were less able to induce post-mating responses in their mates; moreover ageing had negative consequences for male success in competitive situations. Our findings indicate that with advancing age male flies transferred less effective ejaculates and that Sfp composition might change over a male's lifetime in quantity and/or quality, significantly affecting his reproductive success.",

In addition to these dependent variables, the active muscle and overall body OMNI-RES for elastic bands scores were collected at the end of each repetition.Significant differences in heart rate, applied force and OMNI-RES scores between the low- and high-intensity sets were observed. For all the four exercises, high intensity sets elicited higher heart rate, applied force, and RPE compared to the medium and the low overloads. Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.79 in heart rate and ranged 0.69\u20130.80 in OMNI-RES Scale and 0.76\u20130.86 for the applied force.A strong positive and linear relationship was observed between the rating of perceived exertion and both heart rate and applied force.

Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS), a natural polysaccharide with good humectant property, is the depolymerized product of chitosan with various biological activities, among which the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects have been frequently reported in recent years. However, no existing invivo study indicates whether COS has direct protective effect on UV-induced SP. In the current research, we investigated the potential preventive effect of COS against UV-caused damage in hairless mouse dorsal skin. The data showed that COS, by topical application after each UV-radiation for 10\u00a0weeks, effectively inhibited the undesirable changes on the skin induced by UV. To be specific, COS obviously alleviated the macroscopic and histopathological damages of mice skin, via mitigating the disrupted collagenous fibers, as well as improving the relative content of type I collagen and the amount of total collagen. Furthermore, COS effectively inhibited the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and markedly improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH-Px, CAT), as well as the content of skin hydroxyproline and moisture. These findings demonstrated that this natural polysaccharide attenuated UV-induced SP, at least in part, by virtue of favorable regulation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory status, which presumably worked in concert to maintain the morphology and level of dermal collagen.",

The knowledge of immune profile during ageing may provide some interventions that would improve the immune function in elderly and quality of life for old people. However, the identification of a group of potential biomarkers to monitor the ageing process is very difficult. In addition, most of the evidence evaluating immune biomarkers profile is based on data from older Caucasian adults. To our knowledge, no previous Latin American old population-based cohort has evaluated immunological parameters along the ageing process.

Proteome analyses followed LC-MS/MS processing of diaphragm muscle.Advanced aging decreased diaphragm peak power by ~\u00a035% and maximal isometric specific force by ~\u00a015%, and prolonged time to peak twitch tension by ~\u00a030% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These changes in contractile properties were accompanied, and might be caused by, decreases in abundance of calsequestrin, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2\u00a0+-ATPase, sarcalumenin, and parvalbumin that were revealed by our label-free proteomics data. Advanced aging also increased passive stiffness (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which might be a consequence of an upregulation of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins identified by proteomics. Analyses of cysteine redox state indicated that the main diaphragm abnormalities with advanced aging are in metabolic enzymes and mitochondrial proteins.Our novel findings are that the most pronounced impact of advanced aging on the diaphragm is loss of peak power and disrupted cysteine redox homeostasis in metabolic enzymes and mitochondrial proteins.",

We evaluated the relationships between white blood cell subtypes, geriatric assessment, depression and frailty syndrome based on the criteria of physical phenotype. In particular, we aimed to analyze by a two-year follow-up and prospective study the predictive value of alterations in WBC, frailty and functional impairment in terms of hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in institutionalized older women. There was a significant and inverse correlation between the frailty score and lymphocyte count at baseline but it did not display any predictive effect for the outcomes (hospitalizations and mortality). In contrast, monocytes count was significantly correlated with number of hospital stays and predicted hospitalizations in the follow-up. High frailty score directly and better functional status (Barthel score) inversely predicted mortality in the follow-up with an HR of 1.87 (95%CI: 1.04\u20133.35), and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96\u20130.99) (p\u202f<\u202f.05 in both cases). Further investigation into the role of white blood cell subtypes in aging and its associated adverse outcomes in older adults is warranted. Physical phenotype of frailty besides general population, also predicted mortality in older institutionalized women and deserves specific intervention in this subgroup of older individuals.",

Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention (IG) or control group (CG). The IG participated in a 3-month multicomponent exercise intervention focused on strength, balance, stretching exercises, and walking recommendations. Subjects in the CG participated in routine activities. Analyses of outcome parameters were performed in the entire sample and in two subgroups, classified according to participants' physical function score at baseline. The group-by-time interaction, favoring the IG, was significant for the entire sample and for the participants in the low physical function subgroup for the following parameters: waist circumference, 30-s chair-stand, arm-curl, 8-ft timed up-and-go, SPPB score, gait speed, and Berg scale (p\u202f<\u202f.05). In participants with higher physical function at baseline, significant group-by-time interaction was observed in the SPPB score and Berg scale (p\u202f<\u202f.05). When differences were analyzed within groups, the IG maintained or improved in all assessed parameters, while participants in the CG showed a marked decline. Our study showed that a multicomponent exercise program is effective for older people living in LTNH. This is especially relevant in those with lower physical function scores. The lower efficacy of the program in participants with better function might be due to the insufficient exercise demands of our intervention for more fit residents. Future studies should analyze the effects of programs with higher intensities in older people with intermediate to high physical function.",

Mitochondrial dynamics are known to play an important role in the maintenance of cardiac physiological function. However, the effects of estrogen deprivation on cardiometabolic status and cardiac mitochondrial dynamics under conditions of obese-insulin resistance have never been investigated. We hypothesized that estrogen deprivation aggravates cardiac dysfunction through increased cardiac mitochondrial fission in obese-insulin resistant rats. Female rats were fed on either a high fat (HFD, 57.60% fat) or normal (ND, 19.77% fat) diet for 13\u202fweeks. The rats were then divided into 4 groups. Two sham groups (HFS and NDS) and 2 operated or ovariectomized (HFO and NDO) groups (n\u202f=\u202f8/group). Six weeks after surgery, metabolic status, heart rate variability (HRV), left ventricular (LV) function, cardiac mitochondrial function and dynamics, and metabolic parameters were determined. Insulin resistance developed in NDO, HFS and HFO rats as indicated by increased plasma insulin and HOMA index. Although rats in both NDO and HFS groups had markedly impaired LV function indicated by reduced %LVFS and impaired cardiac mitochondrial function, rats in the HFO group had the most severe impairments. Moreover, the estrogen deprived rats (NDO and HFO) had increased cardiac mitochondrial fission through activation of phosphorylation of Drp-1 at serine 616. Our findings indicated that estrogen deprivation caused the worsening of LV dysfunction through increased cardiac mitochondrial fission in obese-insulin resistant rats.",

Animals were assigned to sedentary and exercised groups, given treadmill exercise for 4 consecutive weeks from 5\u202fdays after transient ischemia, and evaluated cognitive function through passive avoidance test and Morris water maze test. SynCAM 2 protein levels were determined in the hippocampus by western blot. In addition, neuronal and synaptic changes were examined by NeuN immunohistochemistry, and SynCAM 1/2/3 and MAP2 double immunofluorescence, respectively. We found that transient cerebral ischemia led to neuronal death in the CA1 area and dentate gyrus, and impaired -memory function; however, 4\u202fweeks of treadmill exercise improved ischemia-induced memory impairment. In addition, SynCAM 1/2/3 and SynCAM 2 expression in the hippocampus was significantly decreased in the sedentary group after transient cerebral ischemia; however, SynCAM 1/2/3 expressionand and SynCAM 2 protein level was significantly increased in the ischemic group with exercise.

The MetS group presented lower protein and higher carbohydrate intake than the non-MetS group. Individuals in the lowest protein intake (<0.72\u202fg/kg/d) had greater odds of presenting abdominal obesity and impaired glucose levels. Higher consumption of carbohydrates was associated with lower HDL levels and higher hypertriglyceridemia.

Randomized control studies conducted in adults have found that resistance training may elicit different outcomes in terms of RFD and muscle strength. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to review systematically the literature for studies regarding the influence of resistance training on muscle strength and RFD in elderly persons. A literature search was performed in major electronic databases from inception to March 2017. Studies including health individuals with a mean age\u00a0\u2265\u00a060\u00a0years, describing the effect of resistance training on RFD and muscle strength were found eligible. The outcomes were calculated as the difference in percentage change between control and experimental groups (% change) and data were presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a095% confidence limits. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model and, in addition, simple and multiple meta-regression analyses were used to identify effects of age, training type, sessions per week and training duration on % change in RFD and muscle strength. Thirteen training effects were collected from 10 studies included in the meta-analysis. The resistance training program had a moderate beneficial effect on both muscle strength (% change\u00a0=\u00a018.40%, 95% CL 13.69\u00a0\u2013\u00a023.30, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and RFD (% change\u00a0=\u00a026.68, 95% CL 14.41\u201335.52, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Results of the meta-regression revealed that the variables age, training type (i.e., strength and explosive), training duration (4\u201316\u00a0weeks) and sessions per week had no significant effects on muscle strength and RFD improvement. Moreover, there was no significant relationship (p\u00a0=\u00a00.073) between the changes in muscle strength and RFD. It can be concluded that explosive training and heavy strength training are effective resistance training methods aiming to improve both muscle strength and RFD after short-to-medium training period. However, muscle strength and RFD seem to adapt differently to resistance training programs, suggesting caution for their interchangeable use in clinical assessments of the elderly.",

Here, the objective was to demonstrate the effect of dietary resveratrol in aged mice in potentiating brain defenses against LipoPolySaccharide (LPS). Acute LPS injection induced a strong proinflammatory effect in 24-months-old C57/BL6 mice hippocampi, increasing InterLeukin (Il)-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (Tnf-\u03b1), Il-1\u03b2, and C-X-C motif chemokine (Cxcl10) gene expression levels. Resveratrol induced higher expression in those cytokines regarding to LPS. Oxidative Stress (OS) markers showed not significant changes after LPS or resveratrol, although for resveratrol treated groups a slight increment in most of the parameters studies was observed, reaching signification for NF-kB protein levels and iNOS expression. However, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress markers demonstrated significant changes in resveratrol-treated mice after LPS treatment, specifically in eIF2\u03b1, BIP, and ATF4. Moreover, as described, resveratrol is able to inhibit the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and this effect could be linked to (eIF2\u03b1) phosphorylation and the increase in the expression of the previously mentioned proinflammatory genes as a response to LPS treatment in aged animals. In conclusion, resveratrol treatment induced a different cellular response in aged animals when they encountered acute inflammatory stimuli.",

Oxidative stress biomarkers comprised superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP). A spectral bioelectrical impedance device was used to estimate resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) at frequency 50\u00a0kHz, and subsequently PhA was calculated as arc-tangent (Xc\u00a0/\u00a0R)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0180\u00b0\u00a0/\u00a0\u03c0.

     "abstract": "Aging is associated with decreased mitochondrial content and function in skeletal muscle, possibly due to compromised biogenesis and autophagic removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. The aim of this study was to compare markers of mitochondrial content and biogenesis and of autophagy between skeletal muscle from young and aged American Quarter Horses. Citrate synthase protein and mtDNA copy number were decreased in triceps brachii (TB) muscle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) from aged horses, suggesting an age-related decline in mitochondrial content. Concomitantly, mRNA expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and TFAM, regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, was lower in aged compared to young TB (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Expression of autophagy markers suggested an age-associated decline of autophagy. The autophagosomal cargo protein SQSTM/p62 accumulated with age in both muscles (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Expression of Autophagy-related protein Atg5 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and the autophagosome-bound form of Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were lower in aged compared to young TB. While LC3 transcript level was elevated in aged compared to young GM (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), protein expression of LC3-II was unaffected. Gene expression of Lysosomal Membrane-Associated Protein 2 (LAMP2) was not affected by age in either muscle. However, LAMP2 protein expression declined with age (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), suggesting a decline in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Taken together, our data indicate that equine skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and biogenesis were impaired with age. Further, autophagosome formation and lysosomal degradation were negatively affected in aged TB and GM, respectively. Future research needs to explore whether interventions targeting these cellular processes can prolong health and performance of aging American Quarter Horses.",

Thirty-six week-old male C57/BL mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal control (NC group), high-energy (HE group) and CR group. After 44\u00a0weeks, the Morris water maze was used to examine learning and memory abilities. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect changes in proteins involved in the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in the mouse hippocampus. Compared with NC group, the swimming distance and escape latency were shorter in the CR group. The protein and mRNA expression of AMPK and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in the CR group were significantly higher than that in HE group. CR increased serum insulin-like growth factor, adiponectin and vaspin, decreased blood glucose and serum malondialdehyde, and improved insulin sensitivity. Our findings demonstrate that a CR diet may improve hippocampus-dependent spatial learning ability of C57/BL mice, accompanied with an increase in AMPK and GLUT4 expression, which indicates AMPK pathway was associated with the neuroprotective effect of CR in mice.",

Stressful situations typically challenge metabolic homeostasis and the capacity to recover from a stress-induced metabolic disorder might be particularly compromised in senescent individuals. In the present work, we report the effects of aging on low temperature stress tolerance and metabolic profiles in Drosophila melanogaster females of different ages. Adult flies aged 4, 16, 30 and 44\u00a0days were subjected to acute and chronic cold stress, and data confirmed a strong decline in cold tolerance and resilience of old flies compared to young counterparts. Using quantitative target GC\u2013MS analysis, we found distinct metabolic phenotypes between young (4\u00a0day-old) and old (44\u00a0day-old) flies, with glycolytic pathways being differentially affected between the two age groups. We also compared the robustness of metabolic homeostasis in young vs. old flies when exposed to cold stress using time-series metabolic analysis. In both age groups, we found evidence of strong alteration of metabolic profiles when flies were exposed to low temperature stress. Interestingly, the temporal metabolic trajectories during the recovery period were similar in young and old flies, despite strong differences in thermotolerance. In conclusion, metabolic signatures markedly changed with age and homeostenosis was observed in the phenotypic response to cold stress. However, these changes did not reflect in different temporal homeostatic response at metabolic level.",

In this study, we hypothesized that low lamin A expression is also associated with frailty in humans. We aimed to develop a non-invasive method to quantify lamin A expression in epithelial and circulating osteoprogenitor (COP) cells, and to determine the relationship between lamin A expression and frailty in older individuals. COP cells and buccal swabs were obtained from 66 subjects (median age 74; 60% female; 26 non-frail, 23 pre-frail, and 17 frail) participating at the Nepean Osteoporosis and Frailty (NOF) Study. We quantified physical performance and disability, and stratified frailty in this population. Lamin A expression in epithelial and COP cells was quantified by flow cytometry. Linear regression models estimated the relationship between lamin A expression in buccal and COP cells, and prevalent disability and frailty. Lamin A expression in buccal cells showed no association with either disability or frailty. Low lamin A expression values in COP cells were associated with frailty. Frail individuals showed 60% lower levels of lamin A compared to non-frail (95% CI \u2212\u00a036 to \u2212\u00a074%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and 62% lower levels compared to pre-frail (95%CI \u2212\u00a040 to \u2212\u00a076%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

This study examined the contractile properties of single vastus lateralis muscle fibers with various myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms (I, I/IIA, IIA and IIAX) across a range of Ca2+ concentrations in 11 young (24.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0years) and 10 older (68.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0years) men and women. The normalized pCa-force curve shifted rightward with age, leading to decreased activation threshold (pCa10) and/or Ca2+ sensitivity (pCa50) for all MHC isoforms examined. In older adults, the slope of the pCa-force curve was unchanged in MHC I-containing fibers (I, I/IIA), but was steeper in MHC II-containing fibers (IIA, IIAX), indicating greater cooperativity compared to young adults. At sub-maximal [Ca2+], specific force was reduced in MHC I-containing fibers, but was minimally decreased in MHC IIA fibers as older adults produced greater specific forces at high [Ca2+] in these fibers. Lessor pCa50 in MHC I fibers independently predicted reduced isokinetic knee extensor power across a range of contractile velocities, suggesting that the Ca2+ response of slow-twitch fibers contributes to whole muscle dysfunction. Our findings show that aging attenuates Ca2+ responsiveness across fiber types and that these cellular alterations may lead to age-related reductions in whole muscle power output.",

In this study, we intended to investigate the signaling mechanisms of VEGF in cognitive protection and anti-apoptosis in a rat model of chronic global cerebral ischemia induced by permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO). The results showed that intranasal administration of VEGF (72\u00a0h post-ischemia for 6 successive days) caused a significant improvement in the cognitive deficits induced by 2-VO, accompanied by a reversal of oxidative stress and VEGF depletion in the hippocampus. In addition, VEGF-treatment decreased the expression of Bax and Caspase-3, increased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl and the main protein involved in energy homeostasis AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which may account for the anti-apoptotic effects of VEGF. Importantly, VEGF administration upregulated the phosphorylation levels of Akt (pAkt) and PI3K, activated Notch1 pathway in 2-VO hippocampus. These findings suggested that intranasal administration of VEGF alleviated cognitive impairment induced by 2-VO injury, and attenuated oxidative damage and neuronal injury in hippocampus associated with the regulation of PI3K/Akt and Notch1 signaling pathway, which might be the underlying mechanisms of VEGF on global chronic cerebral ischemia.",

However, little is known about the consequences of Piog on aging in aged animal models. We used apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE\u2212/\u2212) mice model to evaluate the effects of Piog on aging-related disorders. Our results showed that long-term and low-dose Piog treatment significantly reduced aortic atherosclerosis, aging-related renal glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, and hepatic steatosis, while improved the dermis in skin atrophy, compared to the control group. These morphological alterations were linked to the role of Piog, including regulation of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) levels, increased antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Moreover, accompanied with up-regulation of PPAR\u03b3 expression, Piog had obviously increased the mRNA levels of anti-aging genes Sirtuin1 and Klotho, decreased the p53 protein level, and altered the expression of several genes involving cholesterol excretion, TG biosynthesis and inflammation in the liver. In conclusion, Piog treatment is effective to modulate the oxidative and inflammatory status, cell senescence, and lipid metabolism, contributing to attenuate several aging-related disorders in the aged apoE\u2212/\u2212 mice, thereby maybe a promising protective therapy of aging and age-related diseases.",

In this study, we obtained blood from ageing rats upon reaching 20-, 40-, and 72-wk.-old. Subsequently, we measured representative cellular stress-linked biomolecules (H2O2, glutathione reductase, heme, NADPH, NADP, nitric oxide, GADD153) and cell signals [substance P (SP), free fatty acid, calcium, NF-\u03baB] in either or both blood serum and cytosol. Subsequently, network analysis of the overall cellular stress network was performed. Our results show that there are changes affecting stress-linked biomolecules and cell signals as the rat ages. Additionally, based on our network analysis data, we postulate that NADPH, H2O2, GADD153, and SP are the key components and the interactions between these components are central to the overall age-related cellular stress network in the rat blood. Thus, we propose that the main pathway affecting the overall age-related cellular stress network in the rat blood would entail NADPH-related oxidative stress (involving H2O2) triggering GADD153 activation leading to SP induction which in-turn affects other cell signals.",

ILAS was designed to explore the interrelationship between sarcopenia and frailty in community-dwelling older people in Taiwan. In both studies, muscle mass was estimated by measuring the calf circumference (CC), whereas muscle strength was assessed by handgrip strength testing.The mean age of the 1924 Italian participants was 62.5\u00a0years (standard deviation 8.3, range from 50 to 98\u00a0years), of whom 1031 (53.6%) were women.

A similar effect of age was observed for muscle strength. As for CC, muscle strength was significantly greater among Italian persons relative to Taiwanese participants.Muscle mass and strength declined with age in both ethnic groups. Caucasians showed greater muscle mass and performed better than their Asian counterparts. However, the age at which declines began to appear and the rate of decline during aging were comparable between the two populations.",

When compared to young animals, the aged rats presented increased serum levels of triglycerides and decreased serum levels of HDL cholesterol and glycemia, as well as increased hepatic levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol. The hypercaloric diet increased food intake, body weight gain and adiposity index, leading both young and aged animals to a dyslipidemia, represented by increased serum levels of triglycerides. The hypercaloric diet increased the glycemia and the HOMA index only in the young animals. On the other hand, the diet increased the frequency of hepatocellular microvacuolar degeneration only in the aged animals. In summary, it was observed that the females from different ages respond differently to hypercaloric diet intake: while the aged animals were more resistant to the changes in the glycemic profile, they were more susceptible to the hepatic damage caused by this diet.",

In the inductive phase of EAE, the greater number of fully differentiated effector CD8+ T lymphocytes was found in draining lymph nodes (dLNs) from aged rats of both strains than in strain-matched young rats, but this was particularly prominent in AO rats, which exhibited milder EAE of prolonged duration compared with their DA counterparts. Consistently, dLN IFN-\u03b3+ and IL-17+ CD8+ T cell counts were greater in aged AO than in DA rats. Additionally, the magnitudes of myelin basic protein (MBP)-induced rise in the frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ and IL-17+ CD8+ T cells (providing important help to neuroantigen-specific CD4+ T cells in EAE models characterized by clinically mild disease) were greater in dLN cell cultures from aged AO rats. Consistently, the magnitudes of MBP-induced rise in the frequency of both IFN-\u03b3+ and IL-17+ CD8+ T cells were greater in spinal cord mononuclear cell cultures from aged AO rats compared with their DA counterparts. Besides, with aging CD4+CD25+Foxp3+/CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell ratio changed in spinal cord in the opposite direction. Consequently, in aged AO rats it was shifted towards CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (exhibiting lower suppressive capacity) when compared with DA rats. Moreover, the frequency of CX3CR1+ cells among microglia changed with aging and the disease development. In aged rats, in the effector phase of EAE it was lower in AO than in DA rats. This was accompanied by higher frequency of cells expressing IL-1\u03b2 (whose down-regulation is central for CX3CR1-mediated neuroprotection), but lower that of phagocyting cells among microglia from aged AO compared their DA counterparts. The study indicates the control points linked with strain differences in age-related changes in EAE pathogenesis.",

Aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, PWV) and carotid pulse pressure (PP) were assessed using applanation tonometry. Carotid stiffness was assessed as a single-point PWV using Doppler Ultrasound. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) mean flow and flow pulsatility index (PI) were assessed using transcranial Doppler. Cognitive function was assessed as accuracy and reaction time from the Stroop task.Older adults had lower accuracy scores and longer reaction times on the Stroop task compared to younger adults (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Both age groups had similar increases in MCA mean flow during Stroop (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were significant increases in aortic PWV, carotid PWV, carotid PP and MCA PI during Stroop in older but not younger adults (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Carotid PP and MCA PI assessed during Stroop were statistical mediators of the association between age group and Stroop performance metrics (accuracy and reaction time, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while aortic and carotid PWV were indirect statistical mediators of MCA PI through carotid PP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Older adults experience increases in large artery stiffness during cognitive engagement possibly preventing effective buffering of pulsatile hemodynamic energy entry into the cerebrovasculature. This is important as pulsatile flow during cognitive engagement, and not mean flow per se, was related to overall cognitive performance.",

The burdock root is a blood purifier, lymphatic system strengthener, and natural diuretic. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of aquarobic exercise and burdock intake on serum blood lipids and vascular elasticity in elderly women by implementing a 12-week program with these interventions.Forty elderly female volunteer subjects aged 70 to 80\u00a0years comprised the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a08), aquarobic exercise group (n\u00a0=\u00a011), aquarobic exercise and burdock intake combination group (n\u00a0=\u00a011), and burdock intake group (n\u00a0=\u00a010). The variables of serum blood lipids, and vascular elasticity were measured in all participants before and after the 12-week study.Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels significantly decreased in the aquarobic exercise group and aquarobic exercise and burdock intake combination group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No statistically significant changes in pulse wave velocity were also found within or between the groups before and after participation in the 12-week program.Our findings indicate that aquarobic exercise and burdock intake improved the serum blood lipid levels and vascular elasticity of Korean elderly women. Additionally, burdock extract intake may be useful in vascular health by playing a secondary role in disease prevention and health promotion.",

     "abstract": "Augmented apoptotic signaling can result in degradation of skeletal muscle proteins and loss of myonuclei, ultimately contributing to muscle atrophy and contractile dysfunction. Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is an anti-apoptotic protein highly expressed in skeletal muscle. Here we examined the role of ARC on age-related skeletal muscle apoptosis and wasting by utilizing an ARC-deficient mouse model. Aged mice displayed a number of morphological, phenotypic, and contractile alterations in both soleus and plantaris muscle with aging. Although no differences were found in proteolytic enzyme activity, ARC protein decreased while several anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., BCL2, BCLXL, HSP70, and XIAP) and the release of mitochondrial housed protein (i.e., SMAC, AIF) increased in aged muscle. Importantly, ARC KO mice had low muscle weights and fewer fibers in soleus, with 2-year-old ARC KO mice displaying lower mitochondrial BCL2 protein along with augmented release of CYTC and SMAC in red/oxidative muscle. Overall, these results indicate that aged skeletal muscle undergoes atrophy as well as contractile and fiber type composition alterations despite an increase in anti-apoptotic protein expression. Although some mitochondrial-specific apoptotic alterations occurred in skeletal muscle due to ARC ablation over the lifespan, our data suggest that ARC may not have a large influence during skeletal muscle aging.",

Those physiological and biochemical alterations have been related to the oxidative stress increase associated with old age. The main substrate of lipid peroxidation (LPX) in the central and peripheral nervous systems are the myelin sheaths, and their damage generates a delayed nerve conduction velocity. However, studies in which the neural conduction velocity is related to changes in the redox state are still lacking. Therefore, our aim was to correlate the sensory neural pathways delay in healthy geriatric Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with the oxidative stress associated with physiological aging. Twenty-four monkeys were divided into four groups according to age and gender. Auditory, visual, and somatosensory evoked potentials were obtained. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase enzymatic activity, as well as LPX, were determined from blood samples. Our results showed significant differences between the older and younger age groups in all neural generators of the different sensory pathways evaluated, along with an increase in LPX and the antioxidant enzymatic activities. It suggests that, even though the enzymatic activity was found to be higher in older monkeys, probably as a compensatory effect, it was not enough to avoid LPX damage and the declined electric activity associated with age.",

Functional performance in the older group was tested by 7.5-meter fast walk, timed up-and-go and stair climbing.pP and RPD were higher in young compared to old and this was more pronounced with lower loads. Age-related differences in RPD (range from 37 to 44% across loads) were higher than in pP (24\u201337%). Both pP and RPD showed a positive correlation with functional performance (r: 0.59\u20130.64).To conclude, percent differences in RPD exceed differences in pP between young and old.

Male Wistar rats were grouped into: sedentary control, SE-C; swimming trained, SW-T; SE-C, supplemented sedentary, SE-C(PA) and swimming trainees, SW-T(PA). The supplement was a daily dose of 400\u00a0mg GSPE/kg body weight. Swimming training lasted for 2\u00a0h/day and for 14\u00a0weeks. Glutathione level was increased in response to single and combined interventions in the middle-aged rats. Adult trainees showed increased glutathione peroxidase activity unlike middle-aged wherein increase was seen in SE-C(PA) alone. Lowered catalase activity with age in the HC increased in response to the combined interventions although single interventions were also effective. HC from both ages showed decrease in lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide levels in response to the interventions. GSPE constituents were seen in the HC of swimming trained middle-aged and adult rats. The study suggests that combined intervention is effective in decreasing LPO and H2O2 generation in the HC. Further, the neuronal numbers and planimetric volumes of CA1 pyramidal layer was significantly reduced in middle-aged rats compared to adults. Interestingly, both interventions enhanced the numbers and volumes in adult and middle-aged rats. Thus, age-associated decrease in CA1 neurons could be restored by both the interventions. The results of the present study will help in developing effective therapies for age-associated degenerative changes and cognitive deficits.",

Over the past 20\u00a0years, an increasing number of studies have examined its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and new therapies are continually being discovered. However, despite considerable progress in CVD management, mortality and morbidity remain a major healthcare concern, and frequent hospital admissions compromise the daily life and social activities of these patients.Physical activity has emerged as an important non-pharmacological adjunctive therapy for CVD in older patients, especially for heart failure patients, exerting its beneficial effects on mortality, morbidity, and functional capacity.The mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular benefits of exercise are not wholly clear.Mounting evidence suggest that epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) and non-coding RNA, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), may be induced by physical activity. Recently, a number of miRNAs have been identified as key players in gene expression modulation by exercise. MiRNAs are synthesized by living cells and actively released into the bloodstream through different shuttles. The epigenetic information, thus carried and delivered, is involved in the interplay between environmental factors, including physical activity, and individual genetic make-up.We review and discuss the effects of exercise on age-related CVDs, focusing on circulating miRNA (c-miRNAs) modulation.Epigenetic mechanisms may have clinical relevance in CVD prevention and management; since they can be modified, insights into the implications of lifestyle-related epigenetic changes in CVD etiology may help develop therapeutic protocols of exercise training that can be suitable and effective for elderly patients.",

To elucidate mechanisms that may underlie the maintenance of skeletal muscle density, we conducted a secondary analysis of previously published muscle composition and serum metabolomic data in 73 older adults (average age, 78\u00a0y). Multivariable-adjusted linear regression was used to examine associations between 321 metabolites with muscle composition, defined as the ratio between normal density (NDM) with low density (LDM) thigh muscle cross sectional area (NDM/LDM). Sixty metabolites were significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05 and q\u00a0<\u00a00.30) associated with NDM/LDM. Decreased renal function and the immune response have been previously linked with reduced muscle density, but the mechanisms underlying these connections are less clear. Metabolites that were significantly associated with muscle composition were then tested for their association with circulating markers of renal function (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid), and with the immune response (neutrophils/lymphocytes) and activation (kynurenine/tryptophan). 43 significant NDM/LDM metabolites (including urea) were co-associated with at least 1 marker of renal function; 23 of these metabolites have been previously identified as uremic solutes. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was significantly associated with NDM/LDM (\u03b2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE: \u2212\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, q\u00a0=\u00a00.04). 35 significant NDM/LDM metabolites were co-associated with immune activation. Carbamylation (defined as homocitrulline/lysine) was identified as a pathway that may link renal function and immune activation with muscle composition, as 29 significant NDM/LDM metabolites were co-associated with homocitrulline/lysine, with at least 2 markers of renal function, and with kynurenine/tryptophan. When considering that elevated urea and uremic metabolites have been linked with an increased systemic microbial burden, that antimicrobial defense can be reduced in the presence of carbamylation, and that adipocytes can promote host defense, we propose the novel hypothesis that the age-related increase in adipogenesis within muscle may be a compensatory antimicrobial response to protect against an elevated microbial burden.",

Lower body performance was assessed via isokinetic dynamometer at BL, IP, 120P, 24H, and 48H.YA displayed higher values of peak torque (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) and mean torque (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036) at BL. No significant group differences were observed for markers of muscle damage or TNF-\u03b1. Plasma concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 were unchanged following MDP. STNFR1 concentrations were significantly higher in the YA group compared to MA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). Significant time effects were observed for STNFR1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and STNFR2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). With both groups combined, serum STNFR1 was decreased at 30P (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), while STNFR2 was decreased at 30P (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), 60P (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and 120P (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) relative to BL.The pro-inflammatory response to muscle damage does not appear to decline at middle age when individuals are recreationally trained. However, young men showed significantly higher serum STNFR1 concentrations than middle age men. This may suggest that natural inhibitors of TNF-\u03b1 decline as early as middle age.",

This study aimed to explore the impact of aging on distribution of IgA+ and IgG+ cells in ALNA in abomasum of Bactrian camels. Twenty-four Alashan Bactrian camels were divided into the following four age groups: young (1\u20132\u00a0years), pubertal (3\u20135\u00a0years), middle-aged (6\u201316\u00a0years) and old (17\u201320\u00a0years). IgA+ and IgG+ cells in the lamina propria of ALNA were observed and analyzed using immunohistochemical and statistical techniques. The results showed that, in ALNA, the distribution of IgA+ and IgG+ cells were diffuse, and only a few were in subepithelium dome (SED) and most of them in non-SED. Meanwhile, there were significantly more IgA+ cells than IgG+ cells in SED from the young to the middle aged group, but which reversed in old group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, the aging significantly decreased the densities of IgA+ and IgG+ cells populations in non-SED (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); in SED, there were no significant differences between the densities of IgA+ and IgG+ cells, but which were both significantly lower in old group than those in young group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The results demonstrated that, in mucosal effector sites, the aging significantly decreased the densities of IgA+ and IgG+ cells populations and impacted on the defense barriers formed by IgA and IgG, but had no impact on the scattered characteristics. In inductive sites, the aging dramatically declined their densities, and they should have close relationships with immune memory. These findings lay the foundation for further researching the mucosal immune disorder or decline caused by aging, and especially underscore the importance of researching the impact of aging on the relationship between IgA+ and IgG+ cells populations and the microbiota colonized in abomasum of Bactrian camels.",

The secondary objective was to test whether BMI may contribute to improve the accuracy of a clinical model to predict AD pathology in memory clinic patients with cognitive impairment.One hundred and seven elderly subjects with cognitive impairment (91 memory clinic patients with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 16 with dementia of AD type) and 55 cognitively healthy volunteers were included in this study. All subjects received a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and a lumbar puncture for CSF biomarker analysis. Multiple linear regressions and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were carried out to assess the association between BMI and the CSF biomarkers of AD pathology.BMI was positively correlated with the CSF levels of A\u03b242 and negatively with tau and P-tau181 in participants with cognitive impairment. The associations were independent of age, sex, educational level, type and severity of cognitive impairment, cerebrovascular risk factors and the presence of the APOE\u03b54 allele. Furthermore, BMI significantly improved the sensitivity and specificity of a multi-factorial model to predict the presence of an AD CSF biomarker profile.Lower BMI is associated with cerebral AD pathology rather than with cognitive impairment in elderly subjects with MCI and mild dementia. Along with other clinical factors, decreasing BMI may help the clinician to identify patients with cognitive impairment due to AD.",

     "abstract": "The calcaneal tendon (CT) is the most commonly injured tendon in the human body. Moreover, with advancing age, the amount of damage increases further. Resistance training (RT) could be used to minimize such damages. The aim of the present study was to obtain the identification, detailed protein cataloging and biochemical characterization based on the effects of the aging process and the RT in CT of rats. The analysis by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry showed 142 distinct proteins, however, only 29 proteins met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Aging causes a reduction in the abundance of seven proteins related to extracellular matrix organization, biological regulation and cellular processes. However, RT promoted the positive regulation of proteins important for the maintenance of healthy tendons: seven proteins in young trained and two in older trained group. This study contributes to a better understanding of molecular aspects of the tendon. The down regulation of proteins linked to mechanical function and extracellular matrix remodeling of the tendon during aging can contribute to the increase of injury and weakness in the tendon. Nevertheless, RT proved to be a tool to prevent these adverse effects during aging by increasing proteins involved in the functionality of the tendon.",

To date, little attention has been given to physical activity and physical fitness among nursing home residents with cognitive impairment. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to examine physical activity behavior and physical fitness of institutionalized older adults with cognitive impairment and to investigate their interrelations. Forty-eight older adults with cognitive impairment (83.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.7\u00a0years; 72.9% women) and 22 without cognitive impairment (82.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8\u00a0years; 54.5% women) participated. Physical activity was objectively assessed with accelerometers and physical fitness components (muscular strength, flexibility, balance, body composition and reaction time) were evaluated with physical fitness field tests. Nursing home residents with cognitive impairment spent only ~\u00a01\u00a0min per day in moderate physical activity and ~\u00a089\u00a0min in light physical activity. In average they accumulated 863 (\u00b1\u00a0599) steps per day and spent 87.2% of the accelerometer wear time in sedentary behavior. Participants' physical fitness components were markedly low and according to the cut-offs used for interpreting the results a great number of nursing home residents had an increased risk of associated health problems, functional impairment and of falling. The performance in some physical fitness tests was positively associated with physical activity. Participants without cognitive impairment had higher levels of physical activity and physical fitness than their counterparts with cognitive impairment. These results indicate that nursing home residents, especially those with cognitive impairment, have low levels of physical activity, spent a high proportion of daytime in sedentary behavior and have low physical fitness. Nursing homes should implement health promotion strategies targeting physical activity and physical fitness of their residents.",

PD is hallmarked with progressive deterioration of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons and development of debilitating motor and non-motor clinical symptoms. Klotho protein is the product of an aging-suppressor gene that its overexpression could protect neurons against oxidative injury. This study was undertaken to explore whether exogenous klotho could alleviate injury of nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD. Intrastriatal 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were pretreated with klotho at a dose of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/rat. Results showed that klotho mitigates apomorphine-induced rotational behavior and reduces the latency to initiate and the total time in the narrow beam test. In addition, beneficial effect of klotho was attenuated following i.c.v. microinjection of protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 and Ca(2\u00a0+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) inhibitor KN-62. Additionally, klotho significantly lowered striatal levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), \u03b1 synuclein, phospho-cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB), and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, klotho was capable to prevent degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons within substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC). Collectively, these findings denote neuroprotective potential of exogenous klotho in 6-OHDA rat model of PD through alleviation of astrogliosis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. It was also obtained that part of its protective effect is dependent on PKA/CaMKII/CREB signaling cascade.",

We previously reported that Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) possesses anti-oxidation and anti-apoptotic effects against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity, but the specific molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we showed that MANF up-regulates the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and promotes its translocation into the nucleus. The anti-oxidation and anti-apoptotic effects of MANF could be partially blocked by inhibitor or shRNA-mediated knockdown of Nrf2. Furthermore, MANF activated phospoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling and suppressed glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3\u03b2) activation. PI3K inhibitor (LY49002) abolished effects of MANF on AKT phosphorylation, GSK3\u03b2 inactivation, Nrf2 nuclear translocation and subsequently abrogated MANF-mediates cytoprotection.

Among the components of these systems, the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) offers a good model for aging studies since its three anatomical subdivisions, namely dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), receives light information from retina and projects to different brain areas involved in visual-related functions. Nevertheless, there is very little data available about quantitative morphological aspects in LGN across lifespan. In this study, we used design-based stereology to estimate the number of neurons, glial cells, the glia/neuron ratio and the volume of the LGN of Wistar rats from 3, 13 or 23\u00a0months of age. We examined each LGN subdivision processed by immunohistochemistry for NeuN and Nissl counterstain. We observed no significant age-related neuronal loss in any nuclei and a 21% and 33% significant increase in dLGN and IGL glial cells of 23\u00a0month-old rats. We also observed the glia/neuron relation increases in dLGN of 13\u00a0month-old rats and in dLGN, IGL and vLGN internal portion of 23\u00a0month-old ones. Moreover, we report an age-related increase in IGL volume. These results show region-specific glial hyperplasia during aging within LGN nuclei, perhaps due to compensatory responses to inflammation. In addition, we observed the glia/neuron ratio as a more sensitive parameter to quantify age-related alterations. Hence, we provide an updated and expanded quantitative characterization of these visual-related thalamic nuclei and its variability across lifespan.",

In the model adjusted for sociodemographic factors, MCI was associated with a 1.28 [1.11\u20131.48] times higher odds for low PA in the overall sample.

     "abstract": "A plethora of research has supported the numerous health benefits of resistance training as we age, including positive relationships between muscular strength, muscle mass and reduced all-cause mortality. As such, resistance training has been referred to as medicine. However, participation and adherence remains low, with time constraints and perceived difficulty often cited as barriers to resistance training. With this in mind, we aimed to summarise the benefits which might be obtained as a product of a minimal dose approach. In this sense, participation in resistance training might serve as a prophylactic to delay or prevent the onset of biological aging. A short review of studies reporting considerable health benefits resulting from low volume resistance training participation is presented, specifically considering the training time, frequency, intensity of effort, and exercises performed. Research supports the considerable physiological and psychological health benefits from resistance training and suggests that these can be obtained using a minimal dose approach (e.g. \u2264\u00a060\u00a0min, 2\u00a0d-wk\u2212\u00a01), using uncomplicated equipment/methods (e.g. weight stack machines). Our hope is that discussion of these specific recommendations, and provision of an example minimal dose workout, will promote resistance training participation by persons who might otherwise have not engaged. We also encourage medical professionals to use this information to prescribe resistance exercise like a drug whilst having an awareness of the health benefits and uncomplicated methods.",

The younger men exhibited greater absolute isometric PT, isokinetic PT, MP, and PP at 0.52 and 2.09\u00a0rad\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001\u20130.003); but these differences were no longer present following normalization (P\u00a0=\u00a00.079\u20130.954). The older men exhibited similar EMG amplitude values but higher EI values (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), a greater %decrease in PT (43.6% vs. 38.9%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006), and a lower %increase in MP (167.5% vs. 186.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.049) and PP (125.5% vs. 144.5%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Echo intensity was related to the %decrease in PT (r\u00a0=\u00a00.605; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), %increase in MP (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.419; P\u00a0=\u00a00.009), and %increase in PP (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.605; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) from 0.52 to 2.09\u00a0rad\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01. The absolute age-related reductions in isokinetic strength and power were no longer present following normalization to isometric strength. However, age-related differences in strength and power remained intact when examining the relative differences from slow to fast velocities, which appear to be influenced by the qualitative changes in skeletal muscle.",

     "abstract": "Endothelial cell senescence and Zn nutritional status influence cardiovascular disease. The influence of Zn appears dichotomous, hence it is imperative to understand the relationship with cellular senescence to improve knowledge about the molecular and cellular basis of the disease. Here we aimed to determine: 1) the impact of chronic exposure to a moderately high dose of Zn on senescence of endothelial cells; 2) the changes in Zn homeostasis during the lifespan of primary cultured endothelial cells; and 3) the susceptibility of proliferating and senescent endothelial cells to cell death after short term exposure to increasing doses of Zn and of the Zn chelator TPEN. Chronic exposure to Zn accelerated senescence and untreated cells at later passages, where doubling time had increased, displayed relocation of labile Zn and altered expression of genes involved in the response to Zn toxicity, including SLC30A1, SLC39A6, SLC30A5, SLC30A10 and metallothioneins, indicating that senescent cells have altered zinc homeostasis. Most Zn-dependent genes that were expressed differently between early and late passages were correlated with changes in the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Short-term treatment with a high dose of Zn leads to cell death, but only in the population of cells at both earlier and later passages that had already entered senescence. In contrast, Zn depletion led to death of cells at earlier but not later passages, which suggests that there are sub-populations of senescent cells that are resistant to Zn depletion. This resistant senescent cell population may accumulate under conditions of Zn deficiency and contribute to vascular pathology.",

With the increasing prevalence of centenarians and growing amount of clinical information in large administrative health databases, it is now possible to more fully characterize the health of this unique and heterogeneous population.This study described patterns of health deficits in the centenarian population receiving care from community-based home care services and long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Ontario, Canada. All centenarians who received home care and were assessed using the interRAI-Home Care Assessment instrument between 2007 and 2011 (n\u00a0=\u00a01163) and all centenarians who resided in LTCFs between 2005 and 2011 who were assessed using the interRAI Minimum Data Set (MDS 2.0) (n\u00a0=\u00a02228) were included in this study. Bivariate analyses described the centenarian population while K-means clustering analyses were utilized to identify relatively homogeneous subgroups within this heterogeneous population.The 3391 centenarians were aged 100 to 114 (mean age 101.5\u00a0years \u00b1\u00a01.9 SD) and the majority were women (84.7%). Commonly reported deficits included cognitive impairment, physical impairment, and bladder problems. Centenarians residing in LTCFs were significantly more likely than centenarians receiving home care services to report cognitive or functional impairment, or to exhibit symptoms of depression. The commonalities and uniqueness of four clusters of centenarians are described.Although there is great variability, there is also commonality within the centenarian population. Recognizing patterns within the heterogeneity of centenarians is key to providing high-quality person-centered care and to targeting health promotion and intervention strategies.",

     "abstract": "The aging process is a complex phenomenon that leads the body to several changes, affecting its integrity and resulting in chronic pathologies, which compromises health and quality of life of elderly people. Animals supplemented with fructose have been used as an experimental model for induction of insulin resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the metabolic effects and the levels of oxidative/nitrosative stress in the kidney of senescent rats with a high fructose intake. The animals were allocated into 4 groups: young control (Y), aged control (A), young fructose (YF) and aged fructose (AF). Groups Y and A received water and groups YF and AF received fructose (100\u00a0g/L) in the water, both ad libitum. After 12\u00a0weeks of high fructose intake, the animals were sacrificed to collect their kidneys, blood and the thoracic aorta. The results are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE, analyzed by the One-Way ANOVA test with Newman-Keuls post-test; significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. The fructose overload caused metabolic dysfunctions and insulin resistance, confirming the efficacy of the chosen model. In this study, we observed a body weight gain in the studied groups (except in the elderly fructose group), and an increase in general caloric intake, diuresis and adipose tissue; insulin resistance, increased fasting glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol in the fructose groups. We also found a loss of renal function, increased oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammation, and a reduction of antioxidants and a lower vasodepressor response in the studied groups, especially those who consumed fructose. In summary, our data showed that aging or high fructose intake contributed to the increase of oxidative/nitrosative stress in animals, demonstrating that at the dose and the period of fructose treatment utilized in this study, fructose was not able to aggravate several aspects which were already altered by aging. We believe that the high fructose intake simulates most of the effects of aging, and this understanding would be useful to prevent or minimize many of the alterations caused by this condition.",

     "abstract": "Rodent animal models take at least 18\u00a0months to develop aging phenotypes for researchers to investigate the mechanism of age-related metabolic complications. Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) shortens the process of aging and may facilitate an alternative model for studying age-related insulin resistance. The short-lived strain SAMP8 and two long-lived strains SAM resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice and C57BL/6 mice at 12 (young) and 40\u00a0weeks old (old) were used in the present study. Glucose tolerance test, histology and signaling pathways involved in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and liver and key components of insulin signaling pathway in the skeletal muscle were determined in these three strains. We found that short-lived SAMP8 mice developed symptoms of insulin resistance including hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and impaired glucose tolerance in association with adipocyte hypertrophy and ectopic lipid accumulation in liver and muscle at 40-wk.-old. Significantly increased serum IL-6, leptin, and resistin levels and adipogenic transcription factor PPAR\u03b3 and macrophage marker F4/80 mRNA expression in adipose tissues were observed in old SAMP8 mice, compared with that in young SAMP8 mice. Marked increases in SREBP1 and PPAR\u03b3 and a decrease in PPAR\u03b1 at mRNA level in accordance with activation of mTOR/Akt pathway were contributed to hepatic lipid accumulation in old SAMP8 mice. Down-regulation of insulin signaling pathway including IR\u03b2, IRS1, and AS160 at protein level in skeletal muscle was observed in old SAMP8 mice. At 40-wk.-old, both long-lived SAMR1 and C57BL/6 mice have not been fully developed age-related metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and visceral fat expansion in line with fewer defects in lipid metabolism and skeletal muscle insulin signaling pathway. In conclusion, our data suggest the suitability of the SAMP8 mice as a model for studying age-related metabolic complications.",

Forty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: 14, 18, 23, and 27\u00a0months of age. 1H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 7.0-Tesla MR scanner system. The volumes of the lateral ventricles, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, and whole brain were measured. Open field, object recognition, and Morris water maze tests were conducted to assess cognitive and locomotor functions. Blood was taken for measurements of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl content, and antioxidant enzyme activity. The lateral ventricle volumes were larger, whereas the mPFC, hippocampus, and striatum volumes were smaller in 27-month-old rats than in 14-month-old rats. In behavioral tasks, the 27-month-old rats showed less exploratory activity and poorer spatial learning and memory than did the 14-month-old rats. Biochemical measurements likewise showed increased MDA and lower glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the 27-month-old rats.

     "abstract": "Elderly people often suffer adverse health because of inflammation associated with poor metabolism and cardiovascular dysfunction, but these conditions present differently in men and women. We performed experiments in aged male and female mice to understand this sexual dimorphism. We focused on sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling, which has both protective and detrimental effects on vascular and metabolic function. We examined vascular function of mesenteric (resistance) arteries from aged male and female wild-type (WT) mice compared to littermate S1P receptor 3 (S1PR3) knockouts (KO). We also measured plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, adiponectin, corticosterone and inflammatory cytokines. The novel results of this study are: 1) methacholine-induced vasodilation relied completely on S1PR3 in both sexes, but was dependent on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) only in arteries from aged female mice; 2) S1P-induced vasoconstriction depended solely on S1PR3 in arteries from males, but only partly in females; 3) vasoconstriction to a thromboxane mimetic was decreased by endogenous NOS activity only in arteries from females, regardless of genotype; 4) myogenic responses were lower in arteries from aged WT males compared to females and responses in arteries from KO females were lower than WT females, while the opposite was true of arteries from male mice; 5) aged male mice showed higher fasting glucose and triglycerides with lower plasma adiponectin compared to females and 6) lack of signaling through S1PR3 in females was associated with decreased plasma adiponectin and increased inflammatory mediators. This study showed that there is considerable sexual dimorphism in the vascular and metabolic responses of aged mice and that reduced signaling through S1PR3 could be one mechanism to explain these effects. These results also emphasize that different treatments for mitigating the deleterious effects on vascular health in aged males versus females should be considered.",

     "abstract": "The myriad consequences of age-related muscle atrophy include reduced muscular strength, power, and mobility; increased risk of falls, disability, and metabolic disease; and compromised immune function. At its root, aging muscle atrophy results from a loss of myofibers and atrophy of the remaining type II myofibers. The purpose of this trial (NCT02442479) was to titrate the dose of resistance training (RT) in older adults in an effort to maximize muscle regrowth and gains in muscle function.A randomized, four-arm efficacy trial in which four, distinct exercise prescriptions varying in intensity, frequency, and contraction mode/rate were evaluated: (1) high-resistance concentric-eccentric training (H) 3\u00a0d/week (HHH); (2) H training 2\u00a0d/week (HH); (3) 3\u00a0d/week mixed model consisting of H training 2\u00a0d/week separated by 1 bout of low-resistance, high-velocity, concentric only (L) training (HLH); and (4) 2\u00a0d/week mixed model consisting of H training 1\u00a0d/week and L training 1\u00a0d/week (HL). Sixty-four randomized subjects (65.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0y) completed the trial. All participants completed the same 4\u00a0weeks of pre-training consisting of 3\u00a0d/week followed by 30\u00a0weeks of randomized RT.The HLH prescription maximized gains in thigh muscle mass (TMM, primary outcome) and total body lean mass. HLH also showed the greatest gains in knee extension maximum isometric strength, and reduced cardiorespiratory demand during steady-state walking. HHH was the only prescription that led to increased muscle expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors and this was associated with a lesser gain in TMM and total body lean mass compared to HLH. The HL prescription induced minimal muscle regrowth and generally lesser gains in muscle performance vs. the other prescriptions.The HLH prescription offers distinct advantages over the other doses, while the HL program is subpar. Although limited by a relatively small sample size, we conclude from this randomized dose-response trial that older adults benefit greatly from 2\u00a0d/week high-intensity RT, and may further benefit from inserting an additional weekly bout of low-load, explosive RT.ClinicalTrials.govNCT02442479",

     "abstract": "In addition to viral infections, malignant disorders, autoimmune diseases, and allograft rejection episodes, neopterin increases in older people where it is found to be predictive of overall mortality. Thus, the serum concentrations of this biomarker of systemic immune and inflammation activation, were measured in a small cohort of Sardinian middle-aged, older adults and centenarians. There was a significant positive correlation between neopterin concentrations and age with the subjects in the 95-year-old group with the highest values. Notably, the group of centenarians had neopterin values comparable to those of 80- and 90-year-old groups, and significantly lower than that of 95-year-old group. This suggests a decreased monocyte/macrophage-mediated immune activation and an apparently preserved immune status in centenarians.",

A control (CON) group performed light upper body resistance and flexibility training. Muscle strength, CSA of the quadriceps, 400-m walking speed, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and QOL were assessed before, midway and after training.Within 6-weeks of HL training, increases in all strength measures and CSA were evident and the gains were significantly greater than the CON group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The BFR group had strength increases in leg extension and leg press 1-RM tests, but were significantly lower in leg extension isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and leg extension 1-RM than the HL group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). At 12-weeks HL and BFR training did not differ in MVC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.14). Walking speed increased 4% among all training groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and no changes were observed for overall SPPB score and QOL (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).Both training programs resulted in muscle CSA improvements and HL training had more pronounced strength gains than BFR training after 6-weeks and were more similar to BFR after 12-weeks of training. These changes in both groups did not transfer to improvements in QOL, SPPB, and walking speed. Since both programs result in strength and CSA gains, albeit at different rates, future research should consider using a combination of HL and BFR training in older adults with profound muscle weakness and mobility limitations.",

While active dietary intervention with vitamins B12 and folate decreases homocysteine blood levels, with promising clinical outcomes in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), this so far has not been replicated in established AD populations. The aim of the study is to explore the relationship between hyperhomocystenemia and relevant vitamins as the disease progresses.In this longitudinal cohort study, 38 participants with mild to moderate AD were followed for an average period of 13\u00a0months. Plasma folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations were measured at baseline and at follow-up. Dietary intake of B vitamins was also measured. Spearman's correlations were conducted by homocysteine and B vitamin status.As expected, cognitive status significantly declined over the follow-up period and this was paralleled by a significant increase in homocysteine concentrations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). However, during this follow-up period there was no significant decline in neither dietary intake, nor the corresponding blood concentrations of vitamin B12/folate, with both remaining within normal values. Changes in blood concentrations of B vitamins were not associated with changes in homocysteine levels (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).In this study, the increase in homocysteine observed in AD patients as the disease progresses cannot be solely explained by dietary and blood levels of folate and vitamin B12. Other dietary and non-dietary factors may contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia and its toxic effect in AD, which needs to be explored to optimise timely intervention strategies.",

The current systematic review and meta-analysis determined the effects of healthy aging on performance in bimanual movements as compared to younger adults.Our comprehensive search identified 27 studies that reported bimanual movement performance measures. Each study included a between groups comparison of older (mean age\u00a0=\u00a068.79\u00a0years) and younger adults (mean age\u00a0=\u00a023.14\u00a0years).

This indicates that older adults exhibited more impaired bimanual movement performance in comparison to younger adults in our group of studies.

The present study found no evidence that higher training frequency would induce greater benefit to maximum walking speed (i.e. functional capacity) despite a clear dose-response in dynamic 1-RM strength, at least when predominantly using machine weight-training.

Behav Brain Res 2014). However, diet reduced oxidative stress in the brain, and previous studies using longer-term interventions have documented beneficial effects in cognitive, but not muscle, function. Therefore, we investigated the effect of 6\u00a0months of feeding on measures of cognitive and muscle function in mice. Mice (12\u00a0months, N\u00a0=\u00a015/group) were fed AIN-93M containing 0.15% EGCG and 0.34% B-ALA or standard AIN-93M for 6\u00a0months, then underwent a battery of tests for cognitive and muscle function at 18\u00a0months.

The current study evaluated the effects of 24\u00a0weeks of detraining that followed 12\u00a0weeks of high- and low-load resistance exercise in older adults. Fifty-six older adults (68.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0\u00a0years) were randomly assigned to leg press and leg extension training at either HIGH load (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u201315 repetitions at 80% of one-repetition maximum (1-RM)), LOW load (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a080\u2013100 repetitions at 20% of 1-RM), or LOW\u00a0+ load (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060 repetitions at 20% of 1-RM, immediately followed by 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u201320 repetitions at 40% 1-RM). All protocols ended with volitional fatigue. The main outcome measures included mid-thigh muscle volume, leg press 1-RM, leg extension isometric and isokinetic strength, and functional performance. Tests were performed at baseline, post-intervention and after 24\u00a0weeks of detraining. Results show no effect of load on preservation of muscle volume, which returned to baseline after detraining. Training-induced gains in functional capacity and isometric strength were maintained, independent of load. HIGH and LOW\u00a0+ were more beneficial than LOW for long-lasting gains in training-specific 1-RM. To conclude, gains in muscle volume are reversed after 24\u00a0weeks of detraining, independent of load. This emphasises the need for long-term resistance exercise adherence. The magnitude of detraining in neuromuscular and functional adaptations was similar between groups. These findings underline the value of low-load resistance exercise in older age.

     "abstract": "Evidence from clinical observational studies and animal experiments suggests that hypogonadism is associated with the metabolic syndrome. In most of the experiments, androgen deficiency is induced by gonadectomy in the adulthood and relatively short-term effects of hypogonadism on metabolic parameters are usually observed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of long-term androgen deficiency starting before puberty in middle-aged male rats. The components of the metabolic syndrome were examined in male, female and gonadectomized male rats at the age of 18\u00a0months. Sex differences were observed in plasma testosterone, cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins and also in body weight and in glycemia dynamics during oral glucose tolerance test. Gonadectomy and long-term hypogonadism did not affect most of the analyzed metabolic parameters such as blood pressure, glycemia, plasma insulin and uric acid. The only exception was the significantly higher liver enzymes in plasma and triacylglycerol in liver found in gonadectomized males. Except low-density lipoprotein, neither treatment of middle-aged males and females with letrozole, nor supplementation of estradiol as the metabolite of testosterone in gonadectomized male rats changed any of the observed metabolic parameters. Our results suggest that long-term hypogonadism started before puberty does not induce metabolic syndrome in middle-aged male rats, but may affect the liver. Sex differences in metabolic parameters in middle-aged rats are not mediated by testosterone. Whether hypogonadism predispose to metabolic syndrome in combination with other risk factors needs further clarification.",

Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationship between weak leg power, strong leg power, power asymmetry, and 400-m walk time, stair ascent time, and chair rise time. Participants were then stratified into low power-high asymmetry (LP-HA), low power-low asymmetry (LP-LA), high power-high asymmetry (HP-HA), and high power-low asymmetry (HP-LA) groups who were compared for functional mobility.Knee extensor power asymmetry was unrelated to 400-m walk time (r\u00a0=\u00a00.16, p\u00a0=\u00a00.180), stair ascent time (r\u00a0=\u00a00.22, p\u00a0=\u00a00.094), or chair rise time (r\u00a0=\u00a00.03, p\u00a0=\u00a00.437), whereas weak and strong leg powers were equally associated with 400-m time (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.62, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.62, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), stair ascent time (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.55, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.57, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and chair rise time (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.28, p\u00a0=\u00a00.048; r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.31, p\u00a0=\u00a00.032), respectively. Power asymmetry was lowest at 60\u00a0deg\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 (12%), and increased with contraction velocity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) to 15% at 180\u00a0deg\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 and to 20% at 300\u00a0deg\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01. LP-HA exhibited 26% slower 400-walk time than HP-LA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and 19% slower than HP-HA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.037). LP-HA had 31% slower stair ascent time than HP-LA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033). There were no differences in chair rise performance between groups.Knee extensor power asymmetry was unrelated to 400-m walk, stair ascent, and chair rise performance in older adults. Weak and strong limb powers were equally related to these functional measures, but a leftward shift of the power-mobility curve exists for the weak leg that may hinder clinical assessment if strength or power is measured on a single limb and symmetry is assumed. The greatest degree of knee extensor power asymmetry occurred at the fastest isokinetic velocity, which suggests high-speed muscle contractions may better differentiate laterality of function in older individuals.",

In the present study, we demonstrate the effects of a single high dose of dexamethasone on the expression and distribution of synaptic plasticity-related proteins, growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and synaptophysin, in the hippocampus of 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month-old rats. Acute dexamethasone treatment significantly altered the expression of GAP-43 at the posttranslational level by modulating the levels of phosphorylated GAP-43 and proteolytic GAP-43-3 fragment. The effect was the most pronounced in the hippocampi of the aged animals. The total GAP-43 protein was increased only in 24-month-old dexamethasone-treated animals, and was concomitant with a decrease in calpain-mediated proteolysis. Moreover, by introducing the gray level co-occurrence matrix method, a form of texture analysis, we were able to reveal the subtle differences in the expression pattern of both GAP-43 and synaptophysin in the hippocampal subfields that were not detected by Western blot analysis alone. Therefore, the current study demonstrates, through a novel combined approach, that dexamethasone treatment significantly affects both GAP-43 and synaptophysin protein expression in the hippocampus of aged rats.",

At age class I, voles from A lines had 19% higher VO2run, and 12% higher VLmax, but tended to have 19% lower VSmax, than those from C lines. RQ was nearly 1.0 for both A and C lines. The pattern of age-related changes differed between the lines mainly between age classes I and II, but not in older animals. VSmax increased by 27% in A lines and by 10% in C lines between age class I and II, but between classes II and III, it increased by 16% in both selection directions. VO2run decreased by 7% between age class I and II in A lines only, but in C lines it remained constant across all age classes. VLmax decreased by 8% and VVO2 by 12% between age classes II and III, but similarly in both selection directions. Mortality was higher in A than in C lines only between the age of 1 and 4\u00a0months. The only trait for which the changes in old animals differed between the lines was RQ. In A lines, RQ increased between age classes II and III, whereas in C lines such an increase occurred between age classes I and II. Thus, we did not find obvious effects of selection on the pattern of ageing. However, the physiological performance and mortality of bank voles remained surprisingly robust to ageing, at least until the age of 17\u201319\u00a0months, similar to the maximum lifespan under natural conditions. Therefore, it is possible that the selection could affect the pattern of ageing in even older individuals when symptoms of senility might be more profound.",

All groups were submitted to familiarization and maximum load carrying testing (MLCT). The MLCT was applied before and after the resistance training (RT) period. RT (6\u20138\u00a0\u00d7/session with progressive loads of 50 to 100%, 3\u00a0\u00d7/week and 120\u00a0s interval) was performed in ladder climbing for 15\u00a0weeks. The administration of testosterone propionate was performed 2\u00a0\u00d7/week (10\u00a0mg/kg/body weight). After euthanize, soleus and plantaris muscles were removed and prepared for histochemistry and cytofluorescence. T, S and ST significantly increased their maximum carrying load capacity compared to SEI and SEF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). For soleus postsynaptic region, ST had lower total and stained area than SEF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). For plantaris, the postsynaptic component of T was statistically larger than SEI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). For soleus histochemistry, T, S and ST groups showed the same magnitude of type I myofibers hypertrophy, thus statistically different from SEI and SEF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The cross-sectional area of the type IIa myofibers of the ST was larger than SEF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The volume density of type I myofibers show to be lower in ST than SEI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). As for type IIa myofibers, ST increased Vv [type IIa] compared to SEI and SEF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). For plantaris, T significantly hypertrophied type I myofibers compared to SEI and SEF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). S and ST demonstrated significant increases of type I myofibers compared to SEI and SEF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). As for type IIx myofibers, both S and ST showed myofibers larger than SEI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, only the ST had significant difference compared to SEF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, both therapies, alone or combined, have little effect on the morphology of the NMJ postsynaptic region of distinct muscles.

     "abstract": "We previously reported the ability of dietary supplementation with acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR) to prevent age-related decrease s of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle and liver of old rats. Here, we investigate the effects of ALCAR supplementation in cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum of old rats by analyzing several parameters linked to mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics and antioxidant defenses.We measured the level of the coactivators PGC-1\u03b1 and PGC-1\u03b2 and of the factors regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, finding an age-related decrease of PGC-1\u03b2, whereas PGC-1\u03b1 level was unvaried. Twenty eight-month old rats supplemented with ALCAR for one and two months showed increased levels of both factors. Accordingly, the expression of the two transcription factors NRF-1 and TFAM followed the same trend of PGC-1\u03b2. The level of mtDNA, ND1 and the activity of citrate synthase, were decreased with aging and increased following ALCAR treatment. Furthermore, ALCAR counteracted the age-related increase of deleted mtDNA. We also analyzed the content of proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics (Drp1, Fis1, OPA1 and MNF2) and found an age-dependent increase of MFN2 and of the long form of OPA1. ALCAR treatment restored the content of the two proteins to the level of the young rats. No changes with aging and ALCAR were observed for Drp1 and Fis1. ALCAR reduced total cellular levels of oxidized PRXs and counteracted the age-related decrease of PRX3 and SOD2.Overall, our findings indicate a systemic positive effect of ALCAR dietary treatment and a tissue specific regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis in brain of old rats. Moreover, it appears that ALCAR acts as a nutrient since in most cases its effects were almost completely abolished one month after treatment suspension. Dietary supplementation of old rats with this compound seems a valuable approach to prevent age-related mitochondrial dysfunction and might ultimately represent a strategy to delay age-associated negative consequences in mitochondrial homeostasis.",

Metabolomics technology, a massive information provider, has promoted the understanding of metabolic profile and overall changes of metabolites in organism. In this study, 1H NMR based metabonomics was employed to investigate the dynamic changes of metabolites in whole bodies of male and female Drosophila melanogaster at 3, 15, 30, 45\u00a0days and to research the gender gap of metabolites changes in aging process. The results showed that the metabolic profile at different ages in both male and female Drosophila melanogaster were separated obviously by multivariate analysis. Besides, the variety track of metabolites between male and female Drosophila melanogaster were different, the change speed in female was significantly slow than that in male. In addition, the results showed 14 metabolites (including leucine, valine, alanine, methionine, cysteine, phenylalanine, glycine, glutamine, tyrosine, tryptophan and histidine, succinate, xanthine and DMA) were associated with aging and 7 metabolites (including leucine, valine, methionine, cysteine phenylalanine, succinate and DMA) were associated with gender gap in the aging process of Drosophila melanogaster. Corresponding metabolic mechanisms referenced to the KEGG database and literatures were discussed. This study demonstrate that metabolomics is promising as a valuable method not only to reveal metabolites that related to senescence, but also to help us understand differences between male and female flies in aging process.",

On the other hand, exercise training has been shown to exert beneficial effects on metabolism in the liver and exercise training has been reported to affect hepatic UPR. PGC-1\u03b1 is a transcriptional coactivator involved in exercise training-induced adaptations in skeletal muscle and liver. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of PGC-1\u03b1 in aging and lifelong exercise training-induced hepatic UPR in mice. Liver was obtained from young (3\u00a0months old), aged (15\u00a0months old) and lifelong exercise trained aged wild-type (WT) and whole-body PGC-1\u03b1 knockout (KO) mice. Hepatic BiP, IRE1\u03b1 and cleaved ATF6 protein content increased, whereas PERK protein content was reduced with aging indicating both increased and decreased capacity of specific UPR pathways and increased activity of the ATF6 pathway in the liver with aging. Lifelong exercise training prevented the age-associated change in BiP and IRE1\u03b1 protein, but not cleaved ATF6 protein and resulted in further decreased PERK protein. Taken together, the present study provides evidence that the capacity and activity of the three UPR pathways are differentially regulated in the liver with aging and lifelong exercise training. In addition, PGC-1\u03b1 does not seem to regulate the activity of hepatic UPR in response to exercise training, but to influence the capacity of the liver to induce UPR in a pathway specific manner.",

     "abstract": "Power training has been shown to be more effective than conventional resistance training for improving physical function in older adults; however, most trials have used pneumatic machines during training. Considering that the general public typically has access to plate-loaded machines, the effectiveness and safety of power training using plate-loaded machines compared to pneumatic machines is an important consideration. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the effects of high-velocity training using pneumatic machines (Pn) versus standard plate-loaded machines (PL).Independently-living older adults, 60\u00a0years or older were randomized into two groups: pneumatic machine (Pn, n\u00a0=\u00a019) and plate-loaded machine (PL, n\u00a0=\u00a017). After 12\u00a0weeks of high-velocity training twice per week, groups were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Primary outcomes were lower body power measured using a linear transducer and upper body power using medicine ball throw. Secondary outcomes included lower and upper body muscle muscle strength, the Physical Performance Battery (PPB), gallon jug test, the timed up-and-go test, and self-reported function using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and an online video questionnaire. Outcome assessors were blinded to group membership.Lower body power significantly improved in both groups (Pn: 19%, PL: 31%), with no significant difference between the groups (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.4, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a01.1, 0.3)). Upper body power significantly improved only in the PL group, but showed no significant difference between the groups (Pn: 3%, PL: 6%). For balance, there was a significant difference between the groups favoring the Pn group (d\u00a0=\u00a00.7, 95% CI (0.1, 1.4)); however, there were no statistically significant differences between groups for PPB, gallon jug transfer, muscle muscle strength, timed up-and-go or self-reported function. No serious adverse events were reported in either of the groups.Pneumatic and plate-loaded machines were effective in improving lower body power and physical function in older adults. The results suggest that power training can be safely and effectively performed by older adults using either pneumatic or plate-loaded machines.",

LTL did not differ by APOE genotype. The shortened LTL observed in AD patients appears to stem from progressive telomere erosion possibly correlated with the cognitive decline characterizing conversion from aMCI to AD. LTL reduction, indicating active cell proliferation, may reflect immune system involvement in AD pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "During perimenopause, oxidative stress increases, which may result in disruption of bone turnover, and consequently in osteoporosis. The use of antioxidants may be an effective nutritional approach to reducing osteoporosis in this period of life. Mate tea (MT) (Ilex paraguariensis), a typical and inexpensive beverage consumed in the Brazilian south-east, Argentina and Uruguay, increases antioxidant defense. Our hypothesis was that MT would decrease oxidative stress and mitigate bone deterioration. To test this, we analyzed oxidative stress markers of bone turnover, and local and systemic markers of bone metabolism of rats during natural perimenopause. Female Wistar rats (aged 16\u00a0months) in proven perimenopause period received 20\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0BW/day of mate tea, by gavage (PM\u00a0+\u00a0MT Group, n\u00a0=\u00a010) or water (PM Group, n\u00a0=\u00a010). Female rats aged 4\u00a0months (AD Group, n\u00a0=\u00a010) received water. The treatment period was four weeks. MT minimized the deterioration of rat microarchitecture, characterized by increase in the bone trabecular area, number of osteocytes and areal bone mineral density. These results were accompanied by a lower level of malondialdehyde, an oxidative stress marker, in femoral tissue homogenate. Plasmatic tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, a typical osteoclastic function marker, decreases after treatment, indicating a decrease in osteoclastic function. MT also modified the immunostaining pattern of bone metabolism markers, decreasing the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligant (RANKL), superoxide dismutase isoform 2 (SOD2) and increasing osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor for the RANKL, which positively modulates bone mass. These results suggested MT was capable of decreasing bone resorption by inhibiting the osteoclastogenesis in a RANKL-dependent signaling pathway activated by oxidative stress. Taken together, the results indicated that MT minimized bone loss in perimenopause and this effect is at least partly due to the decrease in oxidative stress, confirming our hypothesis.",

     "abstract": "Aging is known to lead to the impaired recovery of muscle after disuse as well as the increased susceptibility of the muscle to damage. Here, we show that, in the older rats, reloading after disuse atrophy, causes the damage of the muscle fibers and the basement membrane (BM) that structurally support the muscle fibers. Male Wistar rats of 3-(young) and 20-(older) months of age were subjected to hindlimb-unloading for 2\u00a0weeks followed by reloading for a week. In the older rats, the soleus muscles showed necrosis and central nuclei fiber indicating the regeneration of muscle fibers. Furthermore, ectopic immunoreactivity of collagen IV, a major component of the BM, remained mostly associated with the necrotic appearance, suggesting that the older rats were impaired with the ability of repairing the damaged BM. Further, after unloading and reloading, the older rats did not show a significant alteration, although the young rats showed clear response of Col4a1 and Col4a2 genes, both coding for collagen IV. In addition, during the recovery phase, the young rats showed increase in the amount of Hsp47 and Sparc mRNA, which are protein folding-related factor genes, while the older rats did not show any significant variation. Taken together, our findings suggest that the atrophic muscle fibers of the older rats induced by unloading were vulnerable to the weight loading, and that attenuated reactivity of the BM-synthesizing fibroblast to gravity contributes to the fragility of muscle fibers in the older animals.",

Thus, we seek to identify moderators and mediators of the effect of physical frailty on activity limitation change in older people, including gender- and age-specific effects. In a longitudinal study using data from waves 2, 4, and 6 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, unique physical frailty factor scores of 4638 respondents aged 65 to 89\u00a0years are obtained from confirmatory factor analysis of physical frailty, which is specified by three indicators, namely slowness, weakness, and exhaustion. Using a series of autoregressive cross-lagged models, we estimate the effect of physical frailty factor score on activity limitation change, including its moderation by social conditions, and indirect effects through physical and psychological conditions. We find that the effect of physical frailty on activity limitation change is significantly stronger with older age, while it has significant indirect effects through low physical activity, depressive symptoms, and cognitive impairment. In turn, indirect effects of physical frailty through low physical activity and cognitive impairment are stronger with older age. Sensitivity analyses suggest that these effects vary in their robustness to unmeasured confounding. We conclude that low physical activity, depressive symptoms, and cognitive impairment are potentially modifiable mediators on pathways from physical frailty to activity limitation in older people, including those who are very old. This evidence offers support for population-level interventions that target these conditions, to mitigate the effect of physical frailty on activity limitation, and thereby enhance healthspan.",

Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to derive physical function profiles that were subsequently compared across several clinical, psychological and experimental pain measures.Our results support the hypothesis that among persons with knee OA pain, three different physical performance profiles exist with varying degrees of movement-evoked pain. Even as all three groups experienced moderate to severe levels of spontaneous knee pain, those individuals with the most severe movement-evoked pain and lowest physical functional performance also had the least favorable psychological characteristics along with increased mechanical pain sensitivity and temporal summation.Our findings support the need for the assessment and consideration of movement-evoked pain during physical performance tasks as these have the potential to increase the value of functional and pain assessments clinically.

Time (representing fatigue resistance (FR)) was measured during which grip strength (GS) dropped to 75% (FR75), 50% (FR50), 25% (FR25) of its maximum and to exhaustion (FRexhaustion). Grip work ((GW), the area under the force-time curve) was measured for the 4 parts as well as for the first 20 and 30\u00a0s of the fatigue protocol test. Strength decay (GWdecay), defined as the difference between the area under the curve (% GW) and a theoretical maximal area under the curve (assuming there's no strength drop), was also studied. In the elderly participants, relationships (controlling for age and sex) of GS, FR and GW with circulating IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were analyzed.FRexhaustion was similar for all groups, whereas the duration of each of the 4 parts was significantly different between the 3 groups. FR75 was shortest in old patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), FR75-50 was almost twice as long in old community-dwelling compared to old patients and young controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This contrast was inverted for FR50-25 which was significantly shorter in old community-dwelling compared to the other groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). FR25-exhaustionwas significantly longer in young controls compared to the groups of older participants (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017). Old patients showed lower GW for the first 2 parts compared to old community-dwelling and young controls. Also, GWdecay values during the first 20 and 30\u00a0s were significantly higher in old patients compared to old community-dwelling and young controls (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). IL-6 was significantly related to lower GSmax, FR75, FR50, FR25, FRexhaustion, GW75, GW50 and GW75-50.This is the first study reporting differences in strength decay during a sustained maximal handgrip effort according to age and clinical condition. Old patients showed a particularly rapid decline in GW during the first part of sustained handgrip. GW was also significantly related to circulating IL-6. Future studies should confirm whether a shorter FR test protocol (i.e. until FR75) but using a continuous registration of the strength decay could be more informative in a clinical setting compared to the classical FR test (measuring only FR50).",

However, the mechanism behind this remains unclear. Here, we show that the activity of respiratory complex IV (CIV) in brain mitochondria declined in aged mice than in young mice, with no significant change in individual respiratory complex levels and their supercomplex assembly. Reduced CIV activity in the aged mice coincided with reduced binding of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) to CIV. Both reduced activity and OPA1 binding of CIV were rescued by water-solubilized CoQ10 administration to aged mice via drinking water. OCR and the activity and OPA1 binding of CIV in isolated brain mitochondria from aged mice were restored by incubation with CoQ10, but not in the presence of 15-deoxy-prostaglandin J2, an inhibitor of a GTPase effector domain-containing GTPase such as OPA1 and DRP1. By contrast, the CoQ10-responsive restoration of OCR in the isolated mitochondria was not inhibited by Mdivi-1, a selective inhibitor of DRP1. Thus, we propose a novel function of OPA1 in regulating the CIV activity in brain mitochondria in response to CoQ10.",

Long-term training is considered a typical intervention method and is effective for improvement of both muscle quantity and physical function. However, how such training affects muscle quality [i.e., fat-to-muscle ratio as determined by echo intensity (EI)] in older adults requiring long-term care remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 12-month physical training intervention on the quality and quantity of skeletal muscle, physical function, and blood chemistry in older adults requiring long-term care. Seventeen older adults requiring long-term care (Tr-group) and 15 healthy older adults (Cont-group) participated in this study. Patients in the Tr-group performed exercises consisting of resistance and endurance training once or twice a week for 12\u00a0months. The EI and muscle thickness of the thigh were calculated from the rectus femoris and biceps femoris using B-mode transverse ultrasound images. Physical functions (isometric knee extension peak torque, sit-to-stand test, 5-m normal/maximal speed walking, handgrip strength, and timed up and go test) and blood lipid components including adipocytokines were measured at three points, i.e. baseline and 6 and 12\u00a0months after. The thigh EI was significantly lower after 6\u00a0months of training than baseline, and it returned to the initial level after 12\u00a0months of training (baseline, 70.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3\u00a0a.u.; 6\u00a0months, 64.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.2\u00a0a.u.; 12\u00a0months, 72.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2\u00a0a.u.). The thigh muscle thickness, 5-m maximal speed walking, and knee extension torque were significantly improved after 12\u00a0months of training (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The blood chemistry parameters did not significantly change. These results demonstrate that a 12-month training intervention contributes to improvement of muscle quantity and function with tentative changes in muscle quality but has no effect on blood chemistry in older adults requiring long-term care. We conclude that this type of training has the potential to restore the muscle functional abilities of older adults requiring long-term care.",

     "abstract": "Social insects, especially honeybees, have received much attention in comparative gerontology because of their peculiar and flexible ageing patterns that differ across genetically similar individuals. The longevity of honeybee individuals varies and depends on patterns of gene expression during development; females developing into reproductive individuals (queens) live longer than facultatively sterile workers. Here, we show that rebel workers, which develop under queenless conditions after swarming and have high reproductive potential, live approximately 4\u00a0days longer in hives and approximately 3\u00a0days longer in cages than individuals that develop in queenright colonies and have lower reproductive potential; this difference in longevity occurs in both free-flying and caged workers. Moreover, we show that both rebel and normal workers live longer when their ovaries contain more ovarioles. Longer-living rebel workers can benefit the colony because they can fill the generation gap that emerges between workers after queen exchange during swarming. Our findings provide novel evidence that the fecundity of workers in a social insect colony impacts their intrinsic longevity.",

We previously found that the flavan 3-ol fraction derived from cocoa (FL) enhanced energy expenditure with metabolic changes in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we examined the effect of FL on disuse muscle atrophy induced by hindlimb suspension in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were assigned to four groups as follows: unsuspended-vehicle, unsuspended-FL, suspended-vehicle, and suspended-FL. Mice in the vehicle treatment groups were administered distilled water and those in the FL treatment groups were dosed with FL (50\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 2\u00a0weeks. The weights of the gastrocnemius (GC), tibialis anterior (TA), and soleus (SOL), but not the extensor digitorum longus (EDL), decreased significantly in mice with hindlimb suspension (\u2212\u00a011.8%, \u2212\u00a016.5%, and \u2212\u00a041.0%, respectively). This reduction in GC, TA, and SOL mass was inhibited by FL (\u2212\u00a05.3%, +\u00a02.0%, and \u2212\u00a016.6%, respectively). The FL increased the EDL weight >\u00a020% with or without hindlimb suspension. The protein level of the ubiquitin ligase, muscle ring finger-1, in the SOL was significantly increased by hindlimb suspension, but inhibited by treatment with FL. Protein expression of p70S6 kinase in the SOL was significantly decreased by hindlimb suspension, and FL treatment inhibited this change. These results suggested that FL delayed disuse muscle atrophy by metabolic alteration.",

In this study, we validated aged senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) and senescence accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) as animal models of senile osteoporosis with/without sarcopenia. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the 5th lumbar and muscle testing of the two animal strains were measured to confirm the status of osteoporosis and sarcopenia, respectively. Closed fracture was created on the right femur of 8-month-old animals. Radiographs were taken weekly post-fracture. MicroCT and histology of the fractured femur were performed at week 2, 4 and 6 post-fracture, while mechanical test of both femora at week 4 and 6 post-fracture. Results showed that the callus of SAMR1 was significantly larger at week 2 but smaller at week 6 post-fracture than SAMP8. Mechanical properties were significantly better at week 4 post-fracture in SAMR1 than SAMP8, indicating osteoporotic fracture healing was delayed in sarcopenic SAMP8.

To provide a tractable framework to address these gaps in knowledge, the purpose of the current study was to identify the latent variables underlying age-associated differences in time to complete the 9-hole and grooved pegboard tests. The approach involved an independent component analysis that identified associations between the two pegboard times for the two groups of participants with two to six secondary outcomes. The common association across three of the four conditions (two groups and two pegboard tests) was features derived from force-matching tasks requiring submaximal isometric contraction. In addition, there were significant associations for older adults between age, measures of cognitive function, and pegboard times. Nonetheless, the significant associations were unique for each age group and pegboard test. The results provide a framework for subsequent mechanistic studies to identify the adaptations underlying age-associated declines in manual dexterity.",

We had previously shown that consumption of milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) with habitual exercise improves the muscle mass and motor function in humans and mice. Improvement of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) was suggested as one of the mechanisms underlying these effects. In this study, we evaluated the effect of MFGM intake combined with voluntary running (MFGM-VR) on morphological changes of NMJ and motor function in aging mice. Seven months following the intervention, the MFGM-VR group showed a significantly improved motor coordination in the rotarod test and muscle force in the grip strength test compared with the control group at 13 and 14\u00a0months of age, respectively. In 14-month old control mice, the extensor digitorum longus muscle showed increased abnormal NMJs, such as fragmentation and denervation, compared with 6-month old young mice. However, such age-related deteriorations of NMJs were significantly suppressed in the MFGM-VR group. Increase in the expression of NMJ formation-related genes, such as agrin and LDL Receptor Related Protein 4 (LRP4), might contribute to this beneficial effect. Rotarod performance and grip strength showed significant negative correlation with the status of denervation and fragmentation of NMJs. These results suggest that MFGM intake with voluntary running exercise effectively suppresses age-related morphological deterioration of NMJ, thus contributing to improvement of motor function.",

However, little is known about the interaction of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms with autonomic modulation, oxidative stress and cardiovascular risk in females. This study aimed to investigate cardiovascular, autonomic and oxidative parameters after selective NOS inhibition. A spectral analysis of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and heart rate variability (HRV) was performed. NO levels, total antioxidant capacity (TRAP), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity were measured in the plasma of rats treated with L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), S-methylisothiourea (SMT) or saline. Wistar rats, ovariectomized (OVX) with or without estradiol treatment (1\u00a0mg/kg/day) or with a false ovariectomy (SHAM), were submitted to artery and vein catheterization. Cardiovascular parameters were evaluated before and after the administration of saline or NOS inhibitors. After 2\u00a0h, plasma samples were collected for biochemical measurement. At baseline, cardiovascular and autonomic parameters were not different among the groups. L-NAME, the constitutive NOS isoform (cNOS) inhibitor, promoted an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and a reduction in the low frequency band (LF) of SAP of SHAM rats, but this increase was smaller in OVX animals, which also showed a reduction in PON1 activity. The decreased activity of PON1 caused by L-NAME was prevented in the OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E group. SMT, an inducible NOS isoform (iNOS) inhibitor, promoted an increase in MAP and in the LF of SAP, in interbeat interval (IBI) parameters at LFnu and in LF/HF ratio of HRV in all groups, but the OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E had lower levels of NO when compared with the OVX group. Our data suggest that while cNOS contributes to maintaining the activity of PON1 in OVX rats, iNOS activity maintains the levels of NO in OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E rats.",

We found as wild type flies age, sensitivity to alcohol increases and circadian regulation of alcohol-induced behaviors weakens. Decreased circadian modulation is correlated with significantly greater alcohol sensitivity during the subjective day. The circadian clock modulates alcohol-induced mortality in younger flies with increased mortality following alcohol exposure at night. Older flies exhibit significantly longer recovery times following alcohol-induced sedation and increased mortality following binge-like or chronic alcohol exposure. Flies rendered arrhythmic either genetically or environmentally exhibit significantly increased alcohol sensitivity, longer recovery times and increased mortality. We hypothesize that the circadian clock phase specifically buffers behavioral and cellular alcohol sensitivity with this protection diminishing as the circadian clock weakens with age.",

PTX3 displayed a greater area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) than NLR, MMP9, and IL-6 (0.733 versus 0.612 versus 0.725 versus 0.518).Compared to NLR, MMP9, and IL-6, PTX3 displayed greater AUC and association with CAD. PTX3 may become a potentially powerful inflammatory biomarker for CAD.",

The primary and secondary outcomes were disability burden and recovery of pre-hospital function, respectively, assessed monthly over a 6-month period. Index admissions were classified into four mutually exclusive groups based on the type of hospitalization: elective major surgery, non-elective major surgery, critical illness, and other.Disability worsened considerably after hospitalization for each of the four groups. Relative to elective major surgery, the disability burden over 6\u00a0months was significantly greater for non-elective major surgery, critical illness, and other hospitalizations, with adjusted rate ratios (RRs) of 1.37 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.59), 1.37 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.58), and 1.29 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.47), respectively. Overall, recovery to pre-hospital function was observed in only 132 (25.4%) admissions. Relative to elective major surgery, the likelihood of recovering pre-hospital function was considerably lower for each of the three other groups. The results were consistent for basic, instrumental and mobility activities.Among older persons discharged to a SNF after an acute hospitalization, the functional course over 6\u00a0months was generally poor, with recovery to pre-hospital function observed in only one out of every four cases. Relative to elective major surgery, functional outcomes were worse for non-elective major surgery, critical illness, and other hospitalizations.",

Low-volume resistance training (RT) improves muscle strength. However, high-volume RT has shown to improve muscle strength and abdominal fatness in PW. Thus, high-volume RT would elicit greater improvement in fast and usual walking speeds than low-volume RT.To confirm whether the high-volume RT is better than the low-volume RT, we performed a randomized controlled trial (clinical trial registration: RBR-8SBBVP) study to investigated the effects of two different RT volumes (three sets vs. six sets) on fast and usual walking speed performances (fast: one-mile walk test and usual: four-meter walk), muscle strength (1\u00a0RM test), and abdominal fatness (WC \u2013 waist circumference; WC/W waist circumference-to-weight ratio; WHtR \u2013 waist-to-height ratio; ABSI \u2013 A body shape index; BRI \u2013 body roundness index; CI \u2013 conicity index) in PW.Thirty-three PW were randomized (simple randomization) in three groups: control group (CT \u2013 no exercise), low-volume RT (LV) and high-volume RT (HV). The RT consisted of eight total body exercises at 70% of one repetition maximum for 16\u00a0weeks performed three times a week.The fast walking speed (6.1% [CI 95% 2.3\u20139.9]), WC (\u2212\u00a04.1% [CI 95% \u2212\u00a06.9 to \u2212\u00a01.4]), WHtR (\u2212\u00a04.2% [CI 95% \u2212\u00a07.0 to \u2212\u00a01.4]) and BRI (\u2212\u00a010.3% [CI 95% \u2212\u00a017.3 to \u2212\u00a03.4]) improved in the HV when compared to the LV and CT.

Moreover, the anti-oxidation effects of tea water extract at low concentration were different among 4 kinds of brands of green tea. The underlying mechanisms were further explored using genetically manipulated-mutant worms. The anti-oxidative stress effects of green tea water extract depend on the dietary restriction and germline signaling pathways, but not the FOXO and mitochondrial respiratory chain signals. Therefore, tea water extract provides benefits of anti-aging, anti-AD and anti-oxidation.",

Here we evaluate the effects of acute exercise on Sestrin 2 (Sesn2) protein content and autophagy markers in the skeletal muscle of experimental models of aging. Twenty-four months-old C57BL/6\u00a0J male mice were submitted to a single bout of swimming exercise and the gastrocnemius muscle was evaluated by Western blot. Transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis were also performed by using strains of genetically-diverse BXD mice. The bioinformatics analysis showed a negative correlation between Sesn2 mRNA levels in the skeletal muscle and body weight gain, plasma triglycerides and fasting glucose and positive correlation with several autophagic markers in the muscle of BXD mice. Consistent with these findings, low levels of Sesn2 protein content were observed in the gastrocnemius muscle of C57BL/6\u00a0J old mice when compared to young group. Interestingly, the acute aerobic exercise induced Sesn2 accumulation and modulated several markers of autophagy in the gastrocnemius muscle old mice, including unc-51-like kinase-1 (Ulk1) phosphorylation and the protein levels of Atg5, Atg7, p62 and LC3-II. Finally, exercise increased insulin sensitivity in old animals, as demonstrated by kITT. Taken together, these findings demonstrated the acutely, aerobic physical exercise recovers Sestrin 2 protein content and induces autophagy in the skeletal muscle of old mice, contributing with the improvement of insulin sensitivity an aging animal model.",

     "abstract": "Ageing of the human immune system, or immunosenescence, is characterised by distinct changes in the proportion of the various cell types, e.g., increase of the CD14\u00a0+ monocytic cells, decrease of CD19\u00a0+ B lymphocytes, and changes in T cell subpopulations, namely increase of CD4\u00a0+ and CD8\u00a0+ cells which have lost the costimulatory CD28 antigen. Currently, it is believed that the lifelong antigenic burden may be one of the inducers of immunosenescence. Thus far, only one exogenous stimulus, cytomegalovirus infection, has shown to be a major factor in this respect. To find other possible candidates, we evaluated the role of the evolutionary youngest group of human endogenous retroviruses, namely HERV-K(HML-2), on immunosenescence. HERVs exist in the genome as proviruses, but their activation has been detected in several immunopathologic conditions. The expression of HERV-K(HML-2) env was observed to be lower in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of nonagenarians (n\u00a0=\u00a061) than in those of young controls (n\u00a0=\u00a037). These mRNA levels did not correlate with the age-associated differences in the proportions of CD14\u00a0+, CD4\u00a0+\u00a0CD28\u00a0\u2212 and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0CD28\u00a0\u2212 cells, but in the case of CD19\u00a0+ B cells a strong positive correlation was observed in the nonagenarians. Thus, these data suggest that HERVs do not function as antigenic drivers of immunosenescence. On the contrary, expression of HERV-K(HML-2) env is associated with more youthful levels of B cells.",

Aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and intrinsic mechanical stiffness, two measures of arterial stiffness, were assessed in C57BL/6 mice that were young (6\u00a0months), old (27\u201329\u00a0months), or old treated with hesperidin for 4\u00a0weeks. Old compared with young mice had increased aPWV (444\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 vs. 358\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0cm/s, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and mechanical stiffness (6506\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0369 vs. 3664\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0414\u00a0kPa, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Aortic segments from old animals cultured with (+) PVAT had greater mechanical stiffness compared to young (+) PVAT (6454\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0323 vs. 3575\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0440\u00a0kPa, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) that was ameliorated in arteries from old hesperidin treated cultured (+) PVAT (2639\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0258\u00a0kPa). Hesperidin also reversed the aging-related PVAT AGE accumulation (all, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

     "abstract": "The ability to repair cellular damage is reduced with aging, resulting in cellular senescence. Telomeres shorten as cells divide but the rate of telomere attrition is modulated by telomerase, an enzyme that adds nucleotides to the chromosome. Shelterin is a protein complex that acts as a negative regulator of telomerase. The aim of the present study was to investigate age-related differences in telomerase and shelterin responses to acute exercise. We hypothesized that acute exercise would stimulate an increased activity of telomerase (measured by telomerase reverse transcriptase, hTERT) without an increase in activity of shelterin (measured by telomeric repeat binding factor 2, TRF2) in both young and older individuals and that hTERT response would be attenuated in older individuals. Young (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0y, n\u00a0=\u00a011) and older (60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0y, n\u00a0=\u00a08) men and women performed 30\u00a0min of cycling. Blood was collected pre-exercise and 30, 60, and 90-min post-exercise. The trial induced a significant hTERT response in the cohort as a whole (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with greater increases in the young as compared to the older group (time-by-group interaction p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). As expected, TRF2 did not change in response to the trial, however older individuals had a higher TRF2 response at 60\u00a0min (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was an unexpected sex difference, regardless of age, where men had significantly greater hTERT and TRF2 responses to the acute exercise as compared to women (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These data support the hypothesis that aging is associated with attenuated telomerase activation in response to high-intensity exercise; however, this was only evident in men.",

However, it remains unclear whether heat transfer (for heat loss) from the lower (uncompensable) to the upper (compensable) body during passively-induced severe lower-body heating is delayed or attenuated with aging. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to investigate heat transfer from uncompensable to compensable body areas in young men and healthy older men during passively-induced whole-body hyperthermia with a demonstrated post-heating change in core body (rectal; Tre) temperature. Nine healthy older men and eleven healthy young men (69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 vs. 21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 years old, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) participated in passively-induced severe lower-body heating in water at approximately 43\u00a0\u00b0C. Despite a similar increment in Tre (approximately 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C) in both groups, the heating rate was significantly lower in older men than in young men (1.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12 vs. 2.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u00a0\u00b0C/h, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The temperature increase in calf muscle and calf skin (uncompensable areas) was significantly higher in older men than in young men (5.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 vs. 3.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14\u00a0\u00b0C; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and 9.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22 vs. 7.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0\u00b0C; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, respectively).

Furthermore, a post-warming increase in Tre of approximately 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C was observed only in older men (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, older men whose lower extremities were immersed showed greater accumulation and storage of heat in the skin and deep muscles than young men, and this was associated with a greater heat-transfer delay and subsequent inertia in the increased core body (Tre) temperature.",

The aim of this study was to identify possible disparities in muscle strength and force development profiles in high- and low-functioning elderly men and to investigate muscular and neurophysiological factors that could explain the differences.Sixty community-dwelling men in good general health were divided in two groups based on a functional capacity (FC) z-score derived from 6 tests of the Short Physical Performance Battery and Senior Fitness Test (Normal and fast 4\u00a0m-walk tests, normal and fast Timed-up and go, chair and stair tests). Extensor strength of the lower limbs (LL) was obtained for concentric (CLES) contraction and combined with lean masses of LL (LLLM) to yield concentric (CLES/LLLM) index. Similarly, extensor strength of the right Quadriceps Femoris (IKES) was obtained during maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) and combined with right thigh lean mass (rTLM) to produce an isometric strength (IKES/rTLM) index. A muscular profile was obtained from: ascending and descending force slopes during the MVC; Vastus Lateralis (VL) muscle twitches parameters (amplitude, contraction and \u00bd relaxation times); the knee joint velocity (KV) as well as integrated EMG (iEMG) were determined for a sit-to-stand functional evaluation; muscle phenotype. A neurophysiological profile was established from: the spinal excitability (Hmax/Mmax ratio); motoneuron conduction velocity (CV); the completeness of muscle activation (% of force reserve), median power frequency (MPF) and mean amplitude (MA) of the VL EMG signal during MVC.Coincidently, age did not differ between groups. Strength and force indices, descending force slopes for MVC, KV and iEMG during the sit-to-stand evaluation and FC parameters were all significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) lower in the LoFC group than in the HiFC group. In contrast, no difference was observed between groups in: LLLM and rTLM, Hmax/Mmax ratio, CV, twitch parameters and muscle phenotype.The lower concentric and isometric strengths found in the LoFC group could not be accounted for by muscular factors. Similarly, peripheral nervous systems alterations could not explain group differences. It can be suggested that modifications within the central nervous system may be responsible for the differences in the functional status of healthy elderly individuals. Finally, more complex and demanding tasks, such as those requiring greater intensity or coordination, may further clarify how healthy elderly individuals with low and high functional capacities differ.",

     "abstract": "Recent deep sequencing studies on T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire have provided robust data to characterize diversity of T-cell immune responsiveness to a wide variety of peptide antigens, including viral and tumor antigens. The human TCR repertoire declines with age, but this decline has not been fully investigated longitudinally in individuals. Using a deep sequencing approach, we analyzed TCR\u03b2 repertoires longitudinally over approximately 20\u00a0years, with ages ranging from 23 to 50\u00a0years at the start (23 to 65\u00a0years overall), in peripheral-blood CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations that were collected and cryopreserved 3 times at intervals of approximately 10\u00a0years from each of 6 healthy adults (3 men and 3 women). Sequence data at the hypervariable complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) in the TCRB gene locus were evaluated by applying a random-coefficient statistical regression model. Two outcomes were analyzed: total number of distinct TCRB CDR3 sequences as a TCR diversity metric, and clonality of the T-cell populations. TCR repertoire diversity decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and frequencies of clonal populations increased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) with age in CD8 T cells, whereas CD4 T cells retained fairly diverse TCR repertoires along with relatively low clonality. We also found that approximately 10\u201330% and 30\u201380% of read sequences in CD4 and CD8 T cells, respectively, overlapped at different ages within each individual, indicating long-term stable maintenance of T-cell clonal composition. Moreover, many of the most frequent TCRB CDR3 sequences (i.e., top T-cell clones) persisted over 20\u00a0years, and some of them expanded and exerted a dominating influence on clonality of peripheral T-cell populations. It is thus possible that persistence or expansion of top T-cell clones is a driver of T-cell immunity aging, and therefore represents a potential interventional target.",

We analyzed Stratum Pyramidalis (SP), Stratum Lucidum (SL) and Stratum Radiatum (SR) of CA3. 1) ectopic neurons increased in SL and SR of 2VO-vehicle, and 2VO-dipyridamole rats; 2) apoptotic neurons increased in SP of 2VO-vehicle rats and dipyridamole reverted this effect; 3) astrocytes increased in SP, SL and SR of 2VO-vehicle and 2VO-dipyridamole rats; 4) TNF-\u03b1 expression increased in astrocytes, blocked by dipyridamole, and in dendrites in SR of 2VO-vehicle rats; 5) total microglia increased in SL and SR of 2VO-vehicle and 2VO-dipyridamole rats; 6) triads increased in SR of 2VO-vehicle rats and dipyridamole reverted this effect. Microglia cooperated with astrocytes to phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons and debris, and engulfed ectopic non-fragmented neurons in SL of 2VO-vehicle and 2VO-dipyridamole rats, through a new mechanism called phagoptosis. CA3 showed a better adaptive capacity than CA1 to the ischemic insult, possibly due to the different behaviour of astrocytes and microglial cells. Dipyridamole had neuroprotective effects.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of WDL on proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and on neointimal hyperplasia resulted from balloon injury in rats. WDL exhibited strong inhibitory effects against PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation. Cell cycle analysis revealed that WDL induced G0/G1 arrest and prevented cell cycle from entering S phase. Immunoblot analysis suggested that the cell cycle arrest induced by WDL was through Akt suppression and adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, with a subsequent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 induction and cyclin D1 inhibition. We also observed that WDL notably reduced neointima-to-media area ratio of balloon-injured rat common carotid arteries (CCAs) in comparison with those untreated balloon-injured CCAs. The regulation of WDL on protein expressions of Akt, AMPK and cyclin D1 in vivo were also consistent with that in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest WDL exhibits potential preventive effects toward vascular remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia through the reduction of VSMC proliferation via inhibition of Akt and activation of AMPK.",

Although spontaneously diabetic nonhuman primates are used extensively in diabetic related research and are a proven valuable tool for the study of the natural history of diabetes, little is known about the key factors that can cause this metabolic disorder and the preventative measures that could be employed to minimize the consequences of diabetes. Using a model of developing and untreated diabetes, this study describes the effects of housing arrangement (socially group- versus individually single-housed), exercise, diet, age, and sex on fasting plasma glucose, key lipids associated with diabetes, and bodyweight in two large cohorts of nonhuman primates. Key findings include exercise/housing arrangement's contribution to significant differences in bodyweight, levels of fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, and high- and low-density lipoproteins. Age also had profound effects on glucose, triglyceride and high-density lipoproteins, particularly in single-caged animals. Moreover, females had higher fasting glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels than male counterparts within the same housing situations. These factors may be critical to identifying preventive measures that could eventually be used to minimize obesity and diabetes in humans.",

We also evaluated the potential effect of tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) to increase the Nrf2-regulated antioxidant response in hearts from adult and aged rats intoxicated with 3-NP. Our results showed that 3-NP-treatment did not induce cardiac dysfunction, neither in adult nor in aged rats. However, at the cellular level, adult animals showed higher susceptibility to 3-NP-induced damage than aged rats, which suggest that chronic oxidative stress ongoing during aging might have induced an hormetic response that probably prevented from further 3-NP damage. We also found that the oxidative unbalance concurs with unresponsiveness of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response in old animals.",

     "abstract": "Senescence recapitulates the ageing process at the cell level. A senescent cell stops dividing and exits the cell cycle. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) acting as master regulators of transcription, have been implicated in senescence. In the current study we investigated and compared the expression of miRNAs in young versus senescent human fibroblasts (HDFs), and analysed the role of mRNAs expressed in replicative senescent HFL-1 HDFs. Cell cycle analysis confirmed that HDFs accumulated in G1/S cell cycle phase. Nanostring analysis of isolated miRNAs from young and senescent HFL-1 showed that a distinct set of 15 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in senescent cells including hsa-let-7d-5p, hsa-let-7e-5p, hsa-miR-23a-3p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-125a-3p, hsa-miR-125a-5p, hsa-miR-125b-5p, hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-222-3p, hsa-miR-503-5p, hsa-miR-574-3p, hsa-miR-574-5p and hsa-miR-4454. Importantly, pathway analysis of miRNA target genes down-regulated during replicative senescence in a public RNA-seq data set revealed a significant high number of genes regulating cell cycle progression, both G1/S and G2/M cell cycle phase transitions and telomere maintenance. The reduced expression of selected miRNA targets, upon replicative and oxidative-stress induced senescence, such as the cell cycle effectors E2F1, CcnE, Cdc6, CcnB1 and Cdc25C was verified at the protein and/or RNA levels. Induction of G1/S cell cycle phase arrest and down-regulation of cell cycle effectors correlated with the up-regulation of miR-221 upon both replicative and oxidative stress-induced senescence. Transient expression of miR-221/222 in HDFs promoted the accumulation of HDFs in G1/S cell cycle phase. We propose that miRNAs up-regulated during replicative senescence may act in concert to induce cell cycle phase arrest and telomere erosion, establishing a senescent phenotype.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that after influenza A virus (IAV) infection, NK cells from aged mice (17\u201319\u00a0months old) failed to accumulate in draining lymph node (D-LN). We found that both environmental and intrinsic factors played roles for this defect.

To this end, using a skin full-thickness excisional model in aged rats, we compared the closure dynamics of undressing wounds in animals fed an EAAs-enriched diet or standard diet. We assessed the degree of fibrosis and inflammation, as well as relevant signaling molecules such as COL1A1, iNOS and TGF\u03b21. The results showed wound healing was accelerated in EAAs-fed rats, which was accompanied by reduced inflammation and changes in TGF\u03b21 and COL1A1 expression.

We explored this age-dependent severity in a clinically relevant double hit murine ARDS model.Young adult (Y, 10\u201312\u00a0weeks) and middle-old (O, 12\u201313\u00a0months) male C57BL6 mice underwent an aspiration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or control saline vehicle. Twenty hours later, four groups of mice were sacrificed [Y(control), O(control), Y(LPS) and O(LPS)]. Four other groups of mice underwent 3\u00a0h of low tidal volume (8\u00a0mL/kg) mechanical ventilation (MV) [Y(MV), O(MV), Y(LPS\u00a0+\u00a0MV) and O(LPS\u00a0+\u00a0MV)]. Lung mechanics were assessed hourly during MV. Right ventricular pressure and cardiac output were measured at the end of the MV. After sacrifice, lung inflammation, edema and injury were explored with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and histology.After saline aspiration, middle-old mice had a higher respiratory system compliance than young adult mice. LPS aspiration dramatically altered the baseline compliance in middle-old (O(LPS)), but not in young adult (Y(LPS)) mice. Middle-old mice had a more pronounced alteration in lungs mechanics during MV as compared to young adult mice. Lung inflammation (as assessed by the total cell count, IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and MIP-2 concentrations in BAL fluid), systemic inflammation (as assessed by plasma IL-6 concentration) and alveolocapillary leak (as assessed by the total protein concentration of BAL fluid) were higher in O(LPS) and O(LPS\u00a0+\u00a0MV) mice as compared to Y(LPS) and Y(LPS\u00a0+\u00a0MV) mice, respectively. The combination of LPS\u00a0+\u00a0MV induced a higher lung injury as compared to LPS alone in middle-old mice but not in young adult mice. Hemodynamics (systemic blood pressure, cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistances) were similar between Y(MV) and O(MV) on the one hand and between Y(LPS\u00a0+\u00a0MV) and O(LPS\u00a0+\u00a0MV) on the other hand.Middle-old mice were more susceptible to both LPS alone and the combination of LPS and low tidal volume MV as compared to their young adult counterparts.

     "abstract": "Reduced reproduction and dietary restriction each extend lifespan in many animal models, but possible contributions of nutrient oxidation and allocation are largely unknown. Ovariectomy and eating 70% of ad libitum-feeding each extend lifespan in lubber grasshoppers. When feeding levels between the two groups are matched, ovariectomy increases fat and protein storage while dietary restriction reduces fat storage. Because of these disparities in nutrient investment, metabolism may differ between these two life-extending treatments. Therefore, we examined the allocation and organismal oxidation of one representative of each macronutrient class: leucine, oleic acid, and glucose. Ovariectomy and dietary restriction each increased oxidation of dietary leucine. Dietary leucine may play a special role in aging because amino acids stimulate cellular growth. Speeding oxidation of leucine may attenuate cellular growth. Allocation of leucine to muscle was the clearest difference between ovariectomy and dietary restriction in this study. Ovariectomy reduced allocation of leucine to femur muscle, whereas dietary restriction increased allocation of leucine to femur muscle. This allocation likely corresponds to muscle maintenance for locomotion, suggesting dietary restriction increases support for locomotion, perhaps to search for food. Last, ovariectomy decreased oxidation of dietary oleic acid and glucose, perhaps to save them for storage, but the site of storage is unclear. This study suggests that the oxidation of branched-chain amino acids may be an underappreciated mechanism underlying lifespan extension.",

Hyperfragmentation of mitochondrial networks was observed in aged relative to young animals while exercise training normalized mitochondrial network structure in WT, but not in PGC-1\u03b1 KO. Mitochondrial fission protein content (FIS1 and DRP1) relative to mitochondrial content was increased with aging in both WT and PGC-1\u03b1 KO mice, while exercise training lowered mitochondrial fission protein content relative to mitochondrial content only in WT. Mitochondrial fusion protein content (MFN1/2 and OPA1) was unaffected by aging and lifelong exercise training in both PGC-1\u03b1 KO and WT mice.

Emerging evidences suggest that neuropeptide galanin is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, depression and Alzheimer's disease. This article summarized relevant results of our and others studies to highlight the relationship between the galanin system and these age-related chronic diseases. On the one hand, a high galanin expression was found in subjects with type 2 diabetes, depression and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, current data suggest that galanin and its agonists (M617, M1145 and M1153) manifest the characters of anti-insulin resistance, anti-Alzheimer's disease and ameliorate or reinforce depression-like behavior. Specially, activation of GAL2 can alleviate those disease features in human and rodent models.

However, most clinical trials of therapy targeting amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) are unsuccessful because AD is a complex disease involving many genetic and environmental factors. Among various factors, inflammation within the brain in particular has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Furthermore, it has been shown that systemic inflammation can initiate AD. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents might be beneficial for prevention and/or treatment of AD. Many reports have indicated that luteolin, a flavone found in various foods, has preventive and therapeutic value for neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Such effect of luteolin has been linked to its ability to relieve neuroinflammation. Luteolin also has other biological functions, including antioxidant activity that may provide added benefit for prevention of AD. The exact mechanisms of inflammatory pathways involved in AD pathogenesis need to be further understood to utilize luteolin and many other available anti-inflammatory agents to prevent and treat AD. In addition, it is critical to develop better experimental models that resemble the inflammatory conditions in clinical AD.",

     "abstract": "It is well established that adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus declines with age. Our previous studies have suggested that progranulin (PGRN) has a facilitative effect on hippocampal neurogenesis. We have also shown that PGRN plays a role in suppressing excessive neuroinflammatory responses in the cortex and thalamus after brain injury and aging, respectively. However, the roles of PGRN in modulating neurogenesis and neuroinflammatory responses in the hippocampus of aged animals are not yet understood. In the present study, we investigated neurogenesis and neuroinflammation-related responses in the hippocampus of young (15-week-old) and old (135-week-old) wild-type and PGRN-deficient male mice. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus markedly declined with age, and there was no significant difference between the genotype. The number of CD68-positive activated microglia and the expression of lysosomal genes in the hippocampus were significantly increased with age, and PGRN deficiency further increased them. The expression of pro-inflammatory genes was also increased with age, and PGRN deficiency significantly enhanced some of them. These results suggest that PGRN deficiency exacerbates neuroinflammatory responses related to activated microglia in aged animals, while PGRN may not counteract the decline of hippocampal neurogenesis with age.",

There has always been a quest for easily accessible biomarkers to monitor and identify the development of age-associated stress for providing new anti-ageing strategies. Forkhead box protein O3A (FOXO3A) and Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) are such potential markers which plays important role in a wide variety of cellular mechanisms and has been proposed to be an ideal candidate to study longevity and are potential candidate for healthy ageing by oxidative burst.In this study we quantified FOXO3A and SIRT3 proteins in human serum with increasing age and in-vitro assessment of modulation of their expression by the treatment of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha).Four hundred seventy three subjects were enrolled for the study and were divided into three groups according to increasing age [20\u201330\u00a0years (young), 60\u201379\u00a0years (old) and \u2265\u00a080\u00a0years (oldest)]. Serum levels of FOXO3A and SIRT3 proteins were estimated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and validated by ELISA and Western blot. The statistical analysis was done with student's unpaired t-test, one way ANOVA by Stata9 and Graph pad prism5. The expression of these proteins were also analysed in stress induced HEK-293 cell line and level was observed by treatment with stress releasing compound Ashwagandha.In this cross sectional observational study, the serum concentration of FOXO3A and SIRT3 declined significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with increasing age and even after adjustment with all geriatric co-morbidities the level remain downregulated with age. In the stress inducible cell line showed reduced level of proteins which gets upregulated by the treatment of Ashwagandha.This is the first report of inverse relation of age with human serum FOXO3A and SIRT3 and can be excellent marker for ageing with good therapeutic importance for maintaining healthy ageing.",

     "abstract": "Phosphorylation is a major post-translational modification of \u03b1B-crystallin (CryaB) and determines this protein's chaperone activity, intracellular distribution, translocation, and cytoprotective functions. Phosphorylation of CryaB manifests itself as either beneficial or deleterious consequences depending on the extent of phosphorylation and interaction with the cytoskeleton. Herein, for the first time, we compared the age-related alterations of the expression and phosphorylation (on Ser59: pS59) of CryaB in the myocardium of Wistar and senescence-accelerated OXYS rats. The latters, as we demonstrated here, develop cardiomyopathy by the age of 12 months against the background of hypertension. Rats at the age of 20 days, 3, 12, and 24 months were used. The expression of CryaB mRNA (studied by RT-PCR) and of the CryaB protein (analyzed by western blotting) increased with age in the myocardium of both Wistar and OXYS rats, but only at the age of 24 months did their levels become lower in OXYS rats. Phosphorylation of CryaB increased with age in all rats. There was no association of cardiomyopathy with the pS59-CryaB amount in the detergent-soluble fraction either. Moreover, immunostaining of the myocardium revealed that the amount of pS59-CryaB was greater in OXYS rats than in the control animals. This phenomenon was the result of translocation of pS59-CryaB from the detergent-soluble protein fraction to the detergent-insoluble one. The amount of pS59-CryaB in striated sarcomeres (detergent-insoluble) of the myocardium increased with age in both strains but faster in the myocardium of OXYS rats, and its accumulation preceded the development of cardiomyopathy. Translocation of phosphorylated CryaB to sarcomeres affects functional and structural properties (of cardiomyocytes) that are crucial for contractile function and myofibrillar organization and may be an important component of an endogenous mechanism of aging of the myocardium.",

This study aims to explore the joint association of physical activity and insulin sensitivity on skeletal muscle mass and performance of Taiwanese elder people from a metropolitan community.The study sample involved 844 elders who were examined through dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and who underwent tests for fasting blood glucose and serum insulin level. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) equation estimated insulin sensitivity. Physical performance was assessed by grip strength and walking speed, while physical activity status was assessed using the questionnaires answered by the participants.After multivariate adjustment, the mean height- and weight-adjusted skeletal muscle indexes (SMIs) for old people in the highest tertile of HOMA-IR values were 6.7\u00a0kg/m2 and 27.9%, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of old people in the lowest tertile of HOMA-IR values. Compared with physically active elders with the lowest tertile of HOMA-IR values, the physically inactive elders with the highest tertile of HOMA-IR values had significantly low means in the height-adjusted SMI, weight-adjusted SMI, gait speed, and grip strength (0.25\u00a0kg/m2 [p\u00a0=\u00a00.0046], 0.97% [p\u00a0=\u00a00.0068], 0.24\u00a0m/s [p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001], and 2.37\u00a0kg [p\u00a0=\u00a00.0085], respectively).Our study identified the joint associations of physical inactivity and low insulin sensitivity level on SMI, gait speed, and grip strength.

During months 1\u20133, all subjects trained two-times-per-week while during the subsequent 6\u00a0months, training frequency was set according to the group. Oxygen consumption (cycling economy: CE), gross efficiency (GE), blood lactate concentrations (La) and heart rate (HR) were evaluated during a submaximal cycle ergometer test. Hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), heart rate (HRrest) and body composition by DXA were also measured at rest. Maximal strength was measured by a 1-RM leg press test. Most improvements in CE, GE, La and HR occurred in all groups during months 1\u20133. No additional statistically significant improvements were observed during months 4\u20139, although effect sizes for the change in CE and GE at higher workloads indicated a dose-response pattern in men (CE at 75\u00a0W: M1 g\u00a0=\u00a00.13, M2 g\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.58, M3 g\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.89; 100\u00a0W: M1 g\u00a0=\u00a00.43, M2 g\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.59, M3 g\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.68) i.e. higher training frequency (two- and three-times-per-week versus one-time-per-week) led to greater improvements once the typical plateau in performance had occurred. Hb increased in W1 and W2, while no changes were observed in Hct or HRrest. 1-RM increased from months 1\u20133 in all intervention groups (except M2) and from month 4\u20139 only in M3 and in all women intervention groups. During follow-up, maximal strength was maintained but cycling economy returned to the baseline values in all training groups. These data indicate that RT led to significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness during the initial 3\u00a0months of training. This was partly explained by the RT protocol performed but further improvements may require higher training frequency. These changes are likely to be originated by the improved cardiorespiratory functions rather than neuromuscular adaptations evidenced by a lack of significant relationship during the intervention as well as the divergent results during follow-up.",

In order to elucidate the effects of drug on metabolism, we carried out the metabolic analysis of aspirin-treated flies. The results identified 404 active metabolites in addition to the extended lifespan and improved healthspan in fly. There were 28 metabolites having significant changes between aspirin-treated group and the control group, out of which 22 compounds were found to have detailed information. These compounds are reported to have important functions in energy metabolism, amino sugar metabolism, and urea metabolism, indicating that aspirin might be playing positive roles in the fly's lifespan and healthspan improvement. Because of the conservation of major longevity pathways and mechanisms in different species, the health benefits of aspirin administration could be extended to other animals and humans as well.",

Despite sizable interest in determining how age alters walking mechanics, small sample sizes and varied outcome measures have precluded a comprehensive understanding of the impact of age on lower extremity joint kinematics and kinetics.The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the aging gait mechanics literature.The overall standardized effect of age on walking mechanics was computed for 29 studies (200 standardized effects). To account for variation in reported outcome variables, analyses were carried out for comparisons between young and older adult results using all discrete kinematic or kinetic variables reported for the ankle, knee, or hip. Different variables reported for a given joint were then analyzed as separate categorical moderators.The overall standardized effect of age was large for ground reaction forces, moderate for ankle and small for knee and hip kinematics and ankle and hip kinetics. When the analysis was restricted to studies with similar or matched walking speed, the standardized effects of age remained similar except for hip power generation and knee kinematic variables.The results of this meta-analysis provide evidence to support moderate standardized effects, with and without consideration of walking speeds, for changes in lower extremity kinematics, joint moments and powers at the ankle, and ground reaction forces. The standardized effects of age for knee mechanics are less conclusive and would benefit from further research.",

CMV latency has a long-term impact on CD8+ T-cell differentiation. It is unclear, however, whether this effect can be detected in one-year period. To investigate this, we analyzed the remodeling of the CD8+ T-cell compartment during the first year after solid organ transplantation. A total of 55 kidney or lung transplant patients were recruited. CD8+ T-cell subsets were prospectively analyzed at pretransplant, at 3 or 6\u00a0months and 12\u00a0months after transplantation (mo post-Tx). A significant increase in the frequency of CD27\u2212\u00a0CD28\u2212\u00a0CD8+ T cells (from 32.8% to 42.3%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) was observed from pretransplant to 12\u00a0mo post-Tx. Further analysis, however, showed that the largest expansion was observed from 3/6 to 12\u00a0mo post-Tx whereas small non-significant variations were observed from pretransplant to 3/6\u00a0mo post-Tx. The adjusted analysis showed that age and CMV seropositivity were statistically associated with the baseline frequency of CD27\u2212\u00a0CD28\u2212\u00a0CD8+ T cells. Additionally, CMV replication was related to the posttransplant expansion of this subpopulation, since it was not observed in patients without CMV viremia (24% vs. 4.2%). The results indicate that the expanded frequency associated with late CMV replication is additive to the baseline frequency related to aging and CMV seropositivity. If the expanded frequency remains at this high level for a long period it might have clinical consequences related to the control of future reactivations of CMV or of other related viruses.",

We compared individuals from three latitudes reared from the egg stage in the laboratory at temperatures and photoperiods simulating those at the latitude of origin (main experiment) and under common-garden conditions at a fixed temperature and photoperiod (supplementary experiment). Results from the main experiment showed that the high-latitude population exhibited higher mortality rates than the central and southern populations, likely reflecting a cost of their faster development. Age-specific mortality patterns, also indicated higher ageing rates in the high-latitude compared to the low-latitude population, which likely had a genetic basis. The strong within-population variation in hatching dates in the low-latitude population caused variation in mortality rates; individuals that hatched later showed higher mortality rates presumably due to their shorter development times compared to larvae that hatched earlier. In both experiments, larvae from all three latitudes showed accelerated mortality rates with age, which is consistent with a pattern of senescence before adulthood.",

However, the association of physical activity, a modifiable lifestyle behavior, with LTL has not been adequately studied among older adults.In this cross-sectional study, we examined associations of various intensity levels of leisure-time physical activity with LTL among 1476 older white and African American women from the Women's Health Initiative Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health study. Self-reported physical activity was assessed by questionnaire, and LTL was measured by Southern blot. The association between physical activity and LTL was evaluated using multiple linear regression models adjusted for demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related variables.Women were on average aged 79.2 (standard deviation 6.7) years old. In the final model adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking, alcohol, body mass index, a history of chronic diseases, and hormone therapy use, LTL was on average 110 (95% confidence interval, 20\u2013190) base pairs longer among women in the highest (\u2265\u00a017.00\u00a0MET-hours/week) compared with the lowest (<\u00a01.25\u00a0MET-hours/week) level of total leisure-time physical activity (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

     "abstract": "High intensity training (HIT) has been shown to improve maximal aerobic capacity and muscle protein synthesis but has not yet been investigated in senescent rats. We hypothesized that the change of speed (acceleration) during each bout of HIT acts as a stimulus responsible for the adaptations of the organism to exercise. Twenty two month-old (mo) rats (n\u00a0=\u00a013) were subjected to a short acceleration protocol (20\u201330\u00a0min) of exercise, comprising 3 independent bouts of acceleration and compared to an age-matched sedentary group (n\u00a0=\u00a014). The protocol was repeated twice a week for two months. Following the protocol, performance, cardiac function, muscle mechanics, and the cellular and molecular pathways that are implicated in exercise adaptations were investigated. This new training, comprising only 16 sessions, improved maximal oxygen uptake (\u2a52\u00a0O2peak; +\u00a06.6%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), running distance (+\u00a095.2%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), speed (+\u00a029.7%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and muscle function of 24\u00a0mo rats in only 8\u00a0weeks. This new training protocol induced cardiac hypertrophy and improved fractional shortening (47.3% vs. 41.1% in the control group, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and ejection fraction. Moreover, it also improved the mechanics of skeletal muscle by increasing developed force (+\u00a031% vs. the control group, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and maximal mechanical efficiency, activated the IGF1/mTOR/Akt pathway, and reduced the Smad2/3 pathway. Our results clearly show that the change in speed is a stimulus to control cardiac and skeletal muscle mass. This acceleration-based training is not time-consuming and may be adaptable for athletes, the elderly or chronic disease patients in order to improve strength, oxidative capacity, and quality of life.",

     "abstract": "Female mammals undergo natural fluctuations in sex steroid hormone levels throughout life. These fluctuations span from early development, to cyclic changes associated with the menstrual or estrous cycle and pregnancy, to marked hormone flux during perimenopause, and a final decline at reproductive senescence. While the transition to reproductive senescence is not yet fully understood, the vast majority of mammals experience this spontaneous, natural phenomenon with age, which has broad implications for long-lived species. Indeed, this post-reproductive life stage, and its transition, involves significant and enduring physiological changes, including considerably altered sex steroid hormone and gonadotropin profiles that impact multiple body systems, including the brain. The endocrine-brain-aging triad is especially noteworthy, as many paths meet and interact. Many of the brain regions affected by aging are also sensitive to changes in ovarian hormone levels, and aging and reproductive senescence are both associated with changes in memory performance. This review explores how menopause is related to cognitive aging, and discusses some of the key neural systems and molecular factors altered with age and reproductive hormone level changes, with an emphasis on brain regions important for learning and memory.",

     "abstract": "A rapidly growing body of evidence has shown that chromatin undergoes radical alterations as an organism ages, but how these changes relate to aging itself is an open question. It is likely that these processes contribute to genomic instability and loss of transcriptional fidelity, which in turn drives deleterious age-related phenotypes. Interventions associated with increased healthspan and longevity such as reduced insulin/IGF signalling (IIS), inhibition of mTOR and energy depletion resulting in SIRT1/AMPK activation, all have beneficial effects which ameliorate multiple facets of age-associated decline. The impact of these interventions on the epigenome is less certain. In this review we highlight the potential of these interventions to act directly upon the epigenome and promote a youthful chromatin landscape, maintaining genetic and transcriptional memory throughout the lifecourse. We propose that this is a fundamental mechanism through which these interventions are able to curtail the incidence of age-related disease. By revisiting these well characterised interventions, we may be able to identify targetable effectors of chromatin function and use this knowledge to enhance healthspan and longevity in human populations through the measured application of dietary and small molecule interventions.",

     "abstract": "In the 1960s, Leslie Orgel proposed what is now known as the error catastrophe theory of aging, arguing that errors in protein translation that reduce the fidelity of the protein-translating enzymes would lead to a feedback loop of increasingly inaccurate protein synthesis, terminating in the death of the organism. This mechanism of aging would be consistent with the exponential increase of mortality observed in humans, but the error catastrophe theory of aging has been generally disregarded by researchers due to a lack of evidence for an age-related increase in protein errors. Another theory of aging, proposed at roughly the same time, is Leo Szilard's two-hit model of somatic mutation accumulation, which assumed a linear increase in mutations over time but explained the nonlinear pattern of human mortality through a mechanism of genetic and cellular redundancy which kept mortality low until the redundancy was exhausted, at which point mortality rapidly rose. Here, we synthesize the two theories, along with the latest advances in genomics research. We propose a new catastrophe theory of aging, this time with somatic mutations as the primary agent of the feedback loop. Similar to protein errors affecting translation itself, somatic mutations in genes involved in DNA replication and repair would lead to a feedback loop of exponentially increasing mutation load. The difference from protein errors is that somatic mutations would mainly affect gene regulatory regions rather than the much smaller part of the genome encoding protein-coding information. Although the self-stimulating accumulation of somatic mutations is not mutually exclusive with the Szilard-based loss of redundancy, we present evidence that suggests that the accumulated mutations themselves could be numerous enough to cause mortality. Finally, we acknowledge the limits of our current knowledge and propose a course of research practices that will help to confirm or refute our model and advance the field of aging research as a whole.",

In particular, aging impairs the increase in cerebral blood flow triggered by neural activation (termed neurovascular coupling or functional hyperemia), a critical mechanism that matches oxygen and nutrient delivery with the increased demands in active brain regions. From epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies the picture emerges of a complex functional impairment of cerebral microvessels and astrocytes, which likely contribute to neurovascular dysfunction and cognitive decline in aging and in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This overview discusses age-related alterations in neurovascular coupling responses responsible for impaired functional hyperemia. The mechanisms and consequences of astrocyte dysfunction (including potential alteration of astrocytic endfeet calcium signaling, dysregulation of eicosanoid gliotransmitters and astrocyte energetics) and functional impairment of the microvascular endothelium are explored. Age-related mechanisms (cellular oxidative stress, senescence, circulating IGF-1 deficiency) impairing the function of cells of the neurovascular unit are discussed and the evidence for the causal role of neurovascular uncoupling in cognitive decline is critically examined.",

In fat, MR induced a futile lipid cycle concomitant with beige AT accumulation, producing elevated energy expenditure. In liver, MR upregulated fibroblast growth factor 21 and improved glucose metabolism in aged mice and in response to a high-fat diet. Furthermore, MR also reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress in various organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, and brain. Other effects of MR have also been reported in such areas as cardiac function in response to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), identification of molecular mechanisms in bone development, and enhanced epithelial tight junction. In addition, rodent models of cancer responded positively to MR, as has been reported in colon, prostate, and breast cancer studies.The beneficial effects of MR have also been documented in a number of invertebrate model organisms, including yeast, nematodes, and fruit flies. MR not only promotes extended longevity in these organisms, but in the case of yeast has also been shown to improve stress tolerance. In addition, expression analyses of yeast and Drosophila undergoing MR have identified multiple candidate mediators of the beneficial effects of MR in these models.In this review, we emphasize other in vivo effects of MR such as in cardiovascular function, bone development, epithelial tight junction, and cancer.

Further, substitutions on the B, C or D rings either reduced or did not markedly change neuroprotection.

In an in vivo model for neuroprotection, transient cerebral ischemia, efficacious compounds were active in protection of brain tissue from this pro-oxidant insult. We demonstrated that these non-feminizing estrogens engage in a redox cycle with glutathione, using the hexose monophosphate shunt to apply cytosolic reducing potential to cellular membranes. Together, these results demonstrate that non-feminizing estrogens are neuroprotective and protect brain from the induction of ischemic- and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology in an animal model. These features of non-feminizing estrogens make them attractive compounds for assessment of efficacy in AD and stroke, as they are not expected to show the side effects of chronic estrogen therapy that are mediated by ER actions in the liver, uterus and breast.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant form of dementia, is highly correlated with the abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau. Immune responses are key drivers of AD and how they contribute to tau pathology in human disease remains largely unknown. This review summarises current knowledge on the association between inflammatory processes and tau pathology. While, preclinical evidence suggests that inflammation can indeed induce tau hyperphosphorylation at both pre- and post-tangles epitopes, a better understanding of whether this develops into advanced pathological features such as neurofibrillary tangles is needed. Microglial cells, the immune phagocytes in the central nervous system, appear to play a key role in regulating tau pathology, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Their activation can be detrimental via the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, particularly interleukin-1\u03b2, but also potentially beneficial through phagocytosis of extracellular toxic tau oligomers. Nevertheless, anti-inflammatory treatments in animal models were found protective, but whether or not they affect microglial phagocytosis of tau species is unknown. However, one major challenge to our understanding of the role of inflammation in the progression of tau pathology is the preclinical models used to address this question. They mostly rely on the use of septic doses of lipopolysaccharide that do not reflect the inflammatory conditions experienced AD patients, questioning whether the impact of inflammation on tau pathology in these models is dose-dependent and relevant to the human disease. The use of more translational models of inflammation corroborated with verification in clinical investigations are necessary to progress our understanding of the interplay between inflammation and tau pathology.",

This study evaluated the prothrombotic properties of senescent endothelial cells (ECs) and the underlying mechanism. Serial passaging from passage (P)1 to P4 (replicative senescence) of porcine coronary artery ECs, or treatment of P1 ECs with the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor L-NAME (premature senescence) induced acquisition of markers of senescence including increased senescence-associated-\u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activity and p53, p21, p16 expression. Approximately 55% of P3 cells were senescent with a high level oxidative stress, and decreased eNOS-derived nitric oxide (NO) formation associated with increased expression of NADPH oxidase subunits (gp91phox, p47phox), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 but not COX-1, and a decreased eNOS expression leading to a reduced ability of ECs to inhibit platelet aggregation. P3 cells also presented increased expression and activity of tissue factor (TF), a key initiator of the coagulation cascade.Treatment of senesecent cells with a NADPH oxidase inhibitor (VAS-2870) or by a COX inhibitor (indomethacin) reduced oxidative stress, decreased TF activity and expression, and reduced the expression of gp91phox, p47phox and COX-2 and restored the ability of ECs to inhibit effectively platelet aggregation. Thus, replicative endothelial senescence promotes a prothrombotic response involving the down-regulation of the protective NO pathway and the upregulation of the NADPH oxidase- and COXs-dependent oxidative stress pathway promoting TF expression and activity.",

At the end of the intervention, glucose and insulin tolerance, p-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers in liver and adipose tissue, adiponectin secretion, p-NF-\u03baBp65 and TNF-\u03b1 protein expression in adipose tissue were determined.Compared to SAMR1 control, SAMP8 mice demonstrate impaired glucose tolerance and reduction in circulating adiponectin level; in the liver, SAMP8 mice have reduction in p-Aktser473, elevation in PTP1B and APP, p-eIF2\u03b1, GRP78 and p-JNK protein expression. In epididymal (EPI) fat, SAMP8 mice also have elevated p-Aktser473 and PTP1B compared to SAMR1 mice. In both epididymal (EPI) and subcutaneous (SC) fat, there were elevated ER stress markers, reduced p-AMPK and elevated APP, as well as elevated p-NF-\u03baBp65 and TNF-\u03b1 protein expression from SAMP8 compared to SAMR1 mice. In liver, the combined intervention significantly restored p-Aktser473, p-eIF2\u03b1 and p-JNK protein expression. In both EPI and SC fat, the combined intervention is effective for reducing p-NF-\u03baB p65 and TNF-\u03b1 in both fat depot, while only partially reduced ER stress markers in SC fat. As for adiponectin, their combination is unable to reverse reduction in adiponectin level. Adiponectin secretion in SC fat from VD, RSV and VDRSV group were also significantly reduced compared to SAMR1.The combined intervention might exert greater beneficial effects for reversing aging associated metabolic dysfunction in liver and adipose tissue from SAMP8 mice.",

We examined the effects of 12\u00a0weeks of power training on mature BDNF (mBDNF) and total BDNF (tBDNF) in mobility-limited older adults from the Healthy Ageing Network of Competence (HANC) study. We included 47 older men and women: n\u00a0=\u00a022 in the training group (TG: progressive high intensity power training, 2 sessions per week; age 82.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4\u00a0years, 55% women) and n\u00a0=\u00a025 in the control group (CG: no interventions; age 82.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0years, 76% women). Following overnight fasting, basal serum levels of mBDNF and tBDNF were assessed (human ELISA kits) at baseline and post-intervention. At baseline, mBDNF and tBDNF levels were comparable in the two groups, TG and CG. Post-intervention, no significant within-group or between-group changes were observed in mBDNF or tBDNF. Moreover, when divided into responder tertiles based upon changes in mBDNF and tBDNF (i.e. decliners, maintainers, improvers), respectively, comparable findings were observed for TG and CG. Altogether, basal systemic levels of serum mBDNF and tBDNF are not affected in mobility-limited older adults following 12-weeks of power training, and do not appear to be a major mechanistic factor mediating neuroplasticity in mobility-limited older adults.",

Seven healthy young (23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0years, 77.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0kg) and seven healthy older (72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years, 79.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9\u00a0kg) males performed a single bout of resistance exercise involving 6 sets of 10 repetitions of leg press and 6 sets of 10 repetitions of leg extension at 75% one-repetition maximum (1-RM). Muscle biopsy samples were obtained before and 12, 24 and 48\u00a0h after the completion of exercise and analysed for IMCL content and the expression of 48 genes. The subjects refrained from further heavy physical exercise and consumed a standardized diet for the entire experimental period. The IMCL content was ~\u00a02-fold higher at baseline and 12\u00a0h post-exercise in old compared with young individuals. However, no differences between groups were apparent after 48\u00a0h of recovery. There was higher expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (FASN and PPAR\u03b3) during the first 24\u00a0h of recovery. Differential responses to exercise were observed between groups for a number of genes indicating increased inflammatory response (IL6, IkBalpha, CREB1) and impaired fat metabolism and TCA cycle (LPL, ACAT1, SUCLG1) in older compared with younger individuals. A singe bout of resistance type exercise leads to molecular changes in skeletal muscle favouring reduced lipid oxidation, increased lipogenesis, and exaggerated inflammation during post-exercise recovery in the older compared with younger individuals, which may be indicative of a blunted response of IMCL turnover with ageing.",

Serum was available from 48 out of the 56 participants at baseline and after 12\u00a0weeks for determination of eHsp70. Mid-thigh muscle volume (computed tomography), muscle strength (1RM & Biodex dynamometer) and physical functioning (including 6\u00a0min walk distance [6MWD]) were assessed.There was a sex-related dichotomy in the heat shock response to high external load training. We observed a significant decrease in eHsp70 concentration in the HIGH group for female, but not male, subjects. At baseline, men had a larger muscle volume, leg press and leg extension 1RM compared to women (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Also, the 6MWD was significantly higher in men compared to women at baseline. However, this difference disappeared when correcting for height. Moreover, the overall functional performance and physical activity scores were similar in men and women. None of the participants' characteristics nor any of the outcome variables differed between groups at baseline. There was a significant increase in the strength and physical performance parameters in both men and women post-exercise (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Females in the HIGH group clearly demonstrated a larger gain in leg press 1RM and the isometric knee extensor strength compared to females in the LOW group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.044, respectively). More so, we found an inverse association between the change in eHsp70 levels and improvement in isometric knee extensor strength and 6MWD (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.443, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 and r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.428, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; respectively) post exercise.Our results show that resistance training at high external load decreases the resting levels of eHsp70 in older females.

This study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of platelet rich plasma (PRP) in treating patients with minor to moderate knee osteoarthritis (OA) combined with supra-patellar bursitis using a proteomic approach and clinical evaluation tool. In this study, 24 elderly patients with minor to moderate knee OA combined with supra-patellar bursitis were recruited. Musculoskeletal ultrasound was used for accurate needle placement for the aspiration of SF followed by subsequent PRP injections. Three monthly PRP injections were performed to the affected knees for a total of 3\u00a0months. Approximately after the 2nd PRP injection, significant decreases in SF total protein concentrations, volumes, and Lequesne index values were observed. SF proteins associated with chelation and anti-aging physiological functions such as matrilin, transthyretin, and complement 5 increased at least 2-fold in concentrations. Proteins associated with inflammation, such as apolipoprotein A-I, haptoglobin, immunoglobulin kappa chain, transferrin, and matrix metalloproteinase decreased at least 2-fold in concentrations.

A popular theory proposes that senescence is the result of limited investment into mechanisms involved in the prevention and repair of molecular damage, leading to an accumulation of molecular damage with age. In ants, queen and worker lifespans differ by an order of magnitude, and this remarkable difference in lifespan has been shown to be associated with differences in the expression of genes involved in DNA and protein repair. Here we use the comet assay and Western Blotting for poly-ubiquitinated proteins to explore whether these differences in expression lead to differences in the accumulation of DNA damage (comet assay) or protein damage (protein ubiquitination) with age. Surprisingly, there was no difference between queens and workers in the rate of accumulation of DNA damage. We also found that levels of ubiquitinated proteins decreased with age, as previously reported in honeybees. This is in contrast to what has been found in model organisms such as worms and flies. Overall, these results reveal that the link between investment into macromolecular repair, age-related damage accumulation and lifespan is more complex than usually recognised.",

     "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) injury occurs as a result of oxygen occlusion in the carotid artery through embolus or thrombus formation or cerebrovascular hemorrhage. The oxygen thrust during reperfusion causes the generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) which exert a potential threat to neuronal survival. ROS may possibly be arrested by antioxidants. After CIR, extracellular matrix remodeling takes place, which is governed by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Augmentation of lipid per oxidation, perturbation of antioxidant enzyme activities and the loss of pyramidal neuronal cells in rat brain were attributed to CIR injury. Melatonin can readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to exert protective effects as an antioxidant but it is quickly cleared by the circulating blood. Also melatonin is easily degraded by light and hence is found to be ineffective during daytime. Results of the present study showed that unlike free melatonin (FM), the application of nanocapsulated melatonin (NM) exhibited significantly higher potential even at much lower concentrations to rescue neuronal cells and mitochondria during CIR insult and also restored the activities of antioxidative enzymes and MMPs to their normal levels. Hence, nanoencapsulated melatonin may be considered as a suitable drug delivery system for brain to exert protection against CIR injury.",

     "abstract": "In mammals, the relationship between reproductive function and health has been particularly difficult to define. Previously, in old, postreproductive-aged mice, replacement of senescent ovaries with new ovaries from young, actively cycling mice increased life span. We hypothesized that the same factors that increased life span would also influence health span. In the current experiments, we tested two of the seven domains of function/health, sensory function and cognition to determine if exposure of postreproductive female mice to young transplanted ovaries influenced health span. We evaluated control female CBA/J mice at six, 13 and 16\u00a0months of age. Additional mice received new (60d) ovaries at 12 or 17\u00a0months of age and were subsequently evaluated at 16 or 25\u00a0months of age, respectively. Evaluation of sensory function included two measures of olfactory perception; olfactory identification (buried pellet test) and olfactory discrimination (novel recognition block test). We found a significant age-related decline in olfactory identification in 16-month old mice. This decline was avoided by ovarian transplantation at 12\u00a0months of age. The olfactory discrimination block test revealed an age-associated increase in time spent on both the novel and familiar blocks. This trend was reversed in 16-month old new-ovary recipients. We evaluated cognitive behavior with a burrowing behavior test. We detected a significant age-related decrease in burrowing behavior at 16\u00a0months of age. This age-related decrease in burrowing behavior was prevented by ovarian transplantation at 12\u00a0months of age. In summary, we have shown that cognitive behavior and sensory function, which are negatively influenced by aging, can be positively influenced or restored by re-establishment of active ovarian function in aged female mice. These findings provide strong incentive for further investigation of the positive influence of young ovaries on restoration of health in postreproductive females.",

In this study, we investigated if EGCg altered autophagy signaling in skeletal muscle of old rats in response to HS or reloading after HS. Fischer 344\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Brown Norway inbred rats (age 34\u00a0months) were given 1\u00a0ml/day of purified EGCg (50\u00a0mg/kg body weight), or the same sample volume of the vehicle by gavage. One group of animals received HS for 14\u00a0days and the second group of rats received 14\u00a0days of HS, then the HS was removed and they were allowed to recover by ambulating normally around the cage for two weeks. EGCg decreased a small number of autophagy genes in control muscles, but it increased the expression of other autophagy genes (e.g., ATG16L2, SNCA, TM9SF1, Pink1, PIM-2) and HS did not attenuate these increases. HS increased Beclin1, ATG7 and LC3-II/I protein abundance in hindlimb muscles. Relative to vehicle treatment, EGCg treatment had greater ATG12 protein abundance (35.8%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but decreased Beclin1 protein levels (\u2212\u00a0101.1%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after HS. However, in reloaded muscles, EGCg suppressed Beclin1 and LC3-II/I protein abundance as compared to vehicle treated muscles. EGCg appeared to \u201cprime\u201d autophagy signaling before and enhance autophagy gene expression and protein levels during unloading in muscles of aged rats, perhaps to improve the clearance of damaged organelles.

The latter may be amplified if it also leads to a deterioration of the immune system which forms the most important protection against the permanent threat of pathogens and infectious diseases. Here, we investigated how four baseline innate immune parameters (natural antibodies, complement activity, concentrations of haptoglobin and concentrations of nitric oxide) changed with age in free-living great tits (Parus major). We applied both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches as birds were sampled for up to three years of their lives. Three out of the four selected innate immune parameters were affected by age. However, the shape of the response curves differed strongly among the innate immune parameters. Natural antibody levels increased during early life until mid-age to decrease thereafter when birds aged. Complement activity was highest in young birds, while levels slightly decreased with increasing age. Haptoglobin levels on the other hand, showed a linear, but highly variable increase with age, while nitric oxide concentrations were unaffected by age. The observed differences among the four studied innate immune traits not only indicate the importance of considering several immune traits at the same time, but also highlight the complexity of innate immunity. Unraveling the functional significance of the observed changes in innate immunity is thus a challenging next step.",

     "abstract": "Soy-food and its isoflavones, genistein (G) and daidzein (D), were reported to exert mild cholesterol-lowering effect, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this research, first we studied age-related alterations in hepatic cholesterol metabolism of acyclic middle-aged (MA) female rats. Then we tested if purified isoflavones may prevent or reverse these changes, and whether putative changes in hepatic thyroid hormone availability may be associated with this effect. Serum and hepatic total cholesterol (TChol), bile acid and cholesterol precursors, as well as serum TSH and T4 concentrations, hepatic deiodinase (Dio) 1 enzyme activity and MCT8 protein expression were determined by comparing data obtained for MA with young adult (YA) intact (IC) females. Effects of subcutaneously administered G or D (35\u00a0mg/kg) to MA rats were evaluated versus vehicle-treated MA females. MA IC females were characterized by: higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) serum TChol, lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) hepatic TChol and its biosynthetic precursors, lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) hepatic 7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol but elevated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) 27- and 24-hydroxycholesterol in comparison to YA IC. Both isoflavone treatments decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) hepatic 27-hydroxycholesterol, G being more effective than D, without affecting any other parameter of Chol metabolism. Only G elevated hepatic Dio1 activity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, age-related hypercholesteremia was associated with lower hepatic Chol synthesis and shift from main neutral (lower 7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol) to alternative acidic pathway (higher 27-hydroxycholesterol) of Chol degradation to bile acid. Both isoflavones lowered hepatic 27-hydroxycholesterol, which may be considered beneficial. Only G treatment increased hepatic Dio1 activity, thus indicating local increase in thyroid hormones, obviously insufficient to induce prominent cholesterol-lowering effect.",

However, the mechanism underlying MHY908-mediated amelioration of renal inflammation with insulin resistance during aging remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of MHY908 on age-related changes in the IRS/Akt/forkhead box (FoxO) 1 signaling pathway in the kidneys of aged rats and HEK293T cells. Experiments were performed in young, old, and MHY908-fed old rats (1\u00a0mg or 3\u00a0mg/kg/day MHY908 for 4 weeks). We found that MHY908-fed old rats suppressed phosphorylation of IRS/Akt and induced FoxO1 activation, leading to increased expression of MnSOD and catalase. In addition, in insulin-treated cells, MHY908 prevented the FoxO1 inactivation and increased the expression of MnSOD and catalase by inactivating IRS and Akt. In contrast, NF-\u03baB signaling pathway decreased with MHY908 treatment in insulin-treated cells. Furthermore, MHY908 exclusively activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 in the kidneys, leading to the inhibition of insulin-induced NADPH oxidase subunit 4 (NOX4)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and FoxO1 inactivation. In conclusion, MHY908 improved the hyperinsulinemia-induced pro-inflammatory response through NF-\u03baB inactivation and FoxO1 activation in aged rat kidneys. These phenomena suggest that PPAR\u03b1 activation by MHY908 attenuates NOX4-derived ROS generation in response to insulin.",

FFM was derived from Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry analyses.Spearman's rank correlations showed a moderate to high positive monotonic correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.62 to 0.79) between measured and calculated REE (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.005).The mean calculated REE was significantly different from measured REE for all equations except Mifflin-St Jeor. A calculated REE within 10% of measured REE was considered acceptable and the equations of Mifflin-St Jeor, WHO and Harris-Benedict captured 64%, 50% and 45% of the participant, respectively. The Mifflin-St Jeor equation had the lowest root mean square error (138\u00a0kcal), followed by the equation by Harris-Benedict (189\u00a0kcal) and WHO (220\u00a0kcal). The equations from Luhrmann, Henry and Cunningham predicted REE rather poorly in our study subjects, with e.g. <\u00a040% of the individuals within 10% of measured REE.Our results indicate that the Mifflin-St Jeor equation (using FFM) is the most accurate equation estimating REE in these octogenarian men. Harris-Benedict or WHO equations are potential alternatives if information on FFM is unavailable, although their accuracy on an individual level is limited.",

We summarized and evaluated the effect of n-3 fatty acids and MedDiet on cognitive outcomes in a cognitively healthy aged population.Relevant published studies from January 2000 to May 2015 were identified by searching three electronic databases: Pubmed, Web of Science/MEDLINE, and CINHAL. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered.Twenty-four studies were included for the systematic review. n-3 fatty acids were associated with better global cognition and some specific cognitive domains though some results were conflicting. Adherence to the MedDiet was also significantly associated with better cognitive performance and less cognitive decline. Finally, better cognitive performance was observed in men compared to women and mixed results were also found for the influence of APOE4 genotype on the association between n-3 fatty acids or MedDiet and cognition.Studies suggest that n-3 fatty acids in the diet and adherence to the MedDiet are beneficial in slowing age-related cognitive decline. However, more high-quality RCTs would be useful to clarify the effect of n-3 fatty acid supplements on cognition.",

     "abstract": "The lower limb muscle functions of the elderly are known to be preferentially altered by ageing. Traditional training effectively counteracts some of these functional declines but is not always accessible due to its cost and to the accessibility of the training centers and to the incapacities of some seniors to practice some exercises. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) could provide an interesting alternative muscle training technique because it is inexpensive and transportable. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current evidence on the effect of the use of lower limb NMES as a training technique for healthy elderly rehabilitation. Electronic databases were searched for trials occurring between 1971 (first occurrence of NMES training) and November 2016. Ten published articles were retrieved.Training programs either used NMES alone, or NMES associated with voluntary muscle contraction (NMES\u00a0+). They either targeted calves or thigh muscles and their training length and intensity were heterogeneous but all studies noted positive effects of NMES on the elderly's functional status. Indeed, NMES efficiently improved functional and molecular muscle physiology, and, depending on the studies, could lead to better gait and balance performances especially among less active elderly. Given the association between gait, balance and the risk of falls among the elderly, future research should focus on the efficiency of NMES to reduce the high fall rate among this population.",

Physical performance tests are used to screen for pending loss of mobility and can serve as endpoints to monitor the effectiveness of intervention measures. Since limited mobility is associated with the physical and mental health of a person, evaluation of this in preclinical aging studies in mice will provide a translational approach for testing new intervention strategies. We assessed physiological parameters in 4, 12, 20 and 28\u00a0month old C57BL/6 and CB6F1 male mice using a rotating rod, a free running wheel, and a photo beam activity field, designed to determine changes in coordinated walking ability, self-motivated running distance, and anxiety response to a novel environment, respectively. Older mice showed decreased coordinated walking times and decreased running distances, predictive of physical performance ability and motivation in the elderly. Changes in both lateral and vertical movements were observed in a novel cage environment suggesting different levels of anxiety. Because the genetic background of the two mouse strains influenced test results in an age-dependent manner, it is imperative to recognize that diverse genetic backgrounds in mice may yield different data in preclinical studies and would need to be interpreted individually for translational applications.",

Fifty-four adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham (Sham), ovariectomized (OVX), or ovariectomized\u00a0+\u00a0estrogen treatment groups (OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E), with 18 rats in each. The Sham and OVX groups were given normal saline and the OVX\u00a0+\u00a0E group was given estradiol valerate beginning 2\u00a0weeks after ovariectomy and continuing for 4\u00a0weeks. Radioimmunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and chromatography-spectrophotometry were used to detect estradiol, adrenalin, norepinephrine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine in plasma and vanillylmandelic acid in urine. Echocardiography, Doppler blood flow detection technologyand hamnatodynamometer were applied to assess cardiovascular function. After ovariectomy, levels of estrogen reduced, adrenalin and metanephrine increased, and norepinephrine and normetanephrine in the plasma and vanillylmandelic acid in urine decreased. Symptoms indicative of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, including decreased diastolic left ventricular cavity capacity, increased wall thickness and decreased cardiac rate were observed. Different degrees of vasomotor dysfunction appeared in different peripheral positions, and the tail vessels were in relatively systolic conditions. However, the claw pad vessels were diastolic. Besides, blood pressure also increased. After ovariectomy, estrogen levels reduced and the metabolic processes of adrenalin and norepinephrine changed, which impacted cardiovascular functions. Changes of adrenalin and norepinephrine and its metabolites were correlated with the cardiovascular function. Cardiovascular disease occurred during the perimenopausal period.

During the study, berberine was first administrated to treat 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Tg-AD mice and primary neurons. Morris water maze assay, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence staining and histological analysis, transmission electron microscopic analysis were then used to evaluate the effects of the berberine administration. The result showed that berberine significantly improved 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Tg-AD mice's spatial learning capacity and memory retention, promoted autophagy activity identified by the enhancement of brain LC3-II, beclin-1, hVps34, and Cathepsin-D levels as well as the reduction of brain P62 and Bcl-2 levels in AD mice, facilitated reduction of A\u03b2 and APP levels, reduced A\u03b2 plaque deposition in the hippocampus of AD mice, and inhibited b-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression. Similar results were also found in 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Tg-AD primary hippocampal neurons: berbernine treatment decreased the levels of extracellular and intracellular A\u03b21-42, increased the protein levels of LC3-II, beclin-1, hVps34, and Cathepsin-D, and decreased the levels of P62, Bcl-2, APP and BACE1 levels. In summary, berberine shows neuroprotective effects on 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Tg-AD mice and may be a promising multitarget drug in the preventionand protection against AD.",

Both groups performed 3 sets of knee extension exercises at maximal effort, 3 times a week. Muscle strength was assessed through a range of testing velocities on an isokinetic dynamometer. Mobility status was assessed with the short physical performance battery (SPPB) and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) transcript levels were quantified via qRT-PCR.From baseline to post-training, there were several significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) differences in muscle strength and functional characteristics in LVRT (n\u00a0=\u00a013) and HVRT (n\u00a0=\u00a013) groups. From baseline to post-training, MyHC-\u03b1 mRNA and MyHC-IIa mRNA showed a significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase within HVRT but MyHC-IIx mRNA did not change significantly. Our results demonstrate HVRT provides a greater number of muscular enhancements when compared to LVRT, particularly under conditions of high velocity muscle contraction.HVRT is emerging as the optimal training stimulus for the older adult. The present study demonstrates, in addition to increased strength and functional outcomes, HVRT elicits a potentially therapeutic (i.e., slow to fast) transcriptional response in MyHC.",

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sex modulates the FMD response to acute aerobic exercise in older adults.

     "abstract": "Although aging is typically associated with a decreased efficiency of locomotion, somewhat surprisingly, there is also a reduction in the proportion of less efficient fast-twitch Type II skeletal muscle fibers and subsequently a greater propensity for falls. Maximal strength training (MST), with an emphasis on velocity in the concentric phase, improves maximal strength, the rate of force development (RFD), and work efficiency, but the impact on muscle morphology in the elderly is unknown. Therefore we evaluated force production, walking work efficiency, and muscle morphology in 11 old (72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0years) subjects before and after MST of the legs. Additionally, for reference, the MST-induced morphometric changes were compared with 7 old (74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0years) subjects who performed conventional strength training (CST), with focus on hypertrophy, as well as 13 young (24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0years) controls. As expected, MST in the old improved maximal strength (68%), RFD (48%), and work efficiency (12%), restoring each to a level similar to the young. However, of importance, these MST-induced functional changes were accompanied by a significant increase in the size (66%) and shift toward a larger percentage (56%) of Type II skeletal muscle fibers, mirroring the adaptations in the hypertrophy trained old subjects, with muscle composition now being similar to the young. In conclusion, MST can increase both work efficiency and Type II skeletal muscle fiber size and percentage in the elderly, supporting the potential role of MST as a countermeasure to maintain both physical function and fall prevention in this population.",

In the present study, we sought to identify whether the maintenance of muscular strength is an effective method of preserving the intrarenal vasculature condition of middle-aged and older individuals. Therefore, we applied a cross-sectional approach for investigating the relationship between muscular strength and the condition of the intrarenal vasculature. In 169 middle-aged and older individuals without renal disease, handgrip strength (HGS) and the renal resistive index (RRI) were measured as the parameters of muscular strength and intrarenal vascular resistance, respectively. The RRI was elevated with aging (rs\u00a0=\u00a00.499, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and was inversely correlated with HGS (rs\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.370, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The relationship between RRI and HGS remained significant after the consideration of confounders, including age and various central hemodynamic parameters. Furthermore, when the individuals were divided into four groups according to age (middle-aged or older) and the median HGS values, the RRI exhibited the highest values in the older group with lower HGS values (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Our findings indicate that muscular strength as assessed by HGS is independently associated with the RRI (i.e. intrarenal vascular resistance) in middle-aged and older individuals. This finding suggests that the muscular strength may be one of the key factors to preserve the intrarenal vasculature condition.",

Using nationally-representative data from Ireland, the aim of this study was to prospectively assess the association between indicators of the Act-Belong-Commit behavioral domains and incident depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment.Data from two consecutive waves of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) were analyzed. The analytical sample consisted of 6098 adults aged \u2265\u00a050\u00a0years. Validated scales for depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment were used. The number of social/recreational activities engaged in was used as an indicator of Act, social network integration as an indicator of Belong, and frequency of participation in these social/recreational activities as an indicator of Commit. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess associations between baseline indicators of Act-Belong-Commit and incident depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment at two-year follow-up.The adjusted model showed that each increase in the number of social/recreational activities (Act) inversely predicted the onset of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. The same was the case for social network integration (Belong); that is, being well integrated into social networks was a significant protective factor against all mental health outcomes. Finally, frequency of participation in social/recreational activities (Commit) significantly and inversely predicted the onset of depression and anxiety, while the protective effect against cognitive impairment was only marginally significant.Act-Belong-Commit indicators are shown to be protective against mental disorders and cognitive impairment among older Irish adults. This provides further evidence for the campaign's potential efficacy and has potentially wide-ranging implications for preventing the deterioration of mental health and cognitive decline in the aging community.",

However, most literature is based on self-reported PA which is limited by recall bias. Light PA is popular among older adults, but a paucity of objective longitudinal data has considered the relationship between light PA and cognitive ability. We examined if a higher level of objectively measured light PA, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), was prospectively associated with better cognitive ability in older adults.A longitudinal study over 22.12 (\u00b1\u00a01.46) months including 274 community-dwelling older adults across 14 regions in Taiwan was undertaken. Cognitive ability was obtained using a Chinese version of the Ascertain Dementia 8-item Questionnaire (AD8) and light PA and MVPA captured by 7\u00a0days accelerometer positioned on waist. Multivariable negative binomial regression adjusted for confounders were undertaken.274 participants (74.52\u00a0years, 45.6% male) attended the follow-up (96.1%). Higher light PA, independent from MVPA, was associated with a reduced rate of decline in cognitive ability (rate ratio 0.75 [0.60\u20130.92]). MVPA, was also associated with a reduced decline in cognitive ability (rate ratio 0.85 [0.75\u20130.95]). Light PA was protective of cognitive ability in sensitivity analyses removing participants with activities of daily living difficulties, depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment at baseline.Our data suggest that light PA may offer a protective influence of future cognitive ability in community dwelling older adults. The promotion of light PA may be a valuable means to maintain cognitive ability in older age.",

MetS was assessed using the definition of the US National Cholesterol Education Program. Frailty was measured by the frailty phenotype. Mortality was monitored from 1995 until 2015. Associations of MetS with 19-year all-cause mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. MetS was present in 37% of the participants.

     "abstract": "It is not known whether aging alters glutathione metabolic status of the mammalian arterial tissue favoring vascular oxidative stress and dysfunction. Thus we assessed total, reduced and oxidized glutathione (TG, GSH and GSSG, respectively), the glutathione redox ratio (GRR, namely [GSSG]\u00a0/\u00a0[GSH\u00a0+\u00a02GSSG]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100), and the activities of the glutathione status-regulating enzymes glutathione reductase (GSSG-Red), \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase (\u03b3-GCS) and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GT) in the aortic tissue of 9 young adult control rabbits (YACR, about 4\u00a0months old) and 9 aged rabbits (AR, about 4.5\u00a0years old); aortic lipid and protein oxidation and H2O2 were also determined as oxidative stress indicators. Vascular function was assessed on aortic ring preparations. TG and GSH concentrations, together with \u03b3-GCS and \u03b3-GT activities, were significantly lower, while GSSG content and the GRR higher, in the AR than in the YACR aortas; GSSG-Red activity did not differ significantly between the two groups. Heightened levels of lipid and protein oxidation and H2O2 occurred in the AR aortas, indicating age-dependent vascular oxidative stress. Moreover, in the whole population of 18 rabbits, the aortic values of GSH and related enzyme activities were inversely and significantly correlated with those of lipid and protein oxidation and H2O2, highlighting the antioxidant role of GSH and related enzymes in the vascular tissue. Aortic endothelium-dependent vasodilation was lower in the AR than in the YACR. In conclusion, glutathione metabolic status is altered in the aged rabbit aorta reflecting depressed \u03b3-GCS- and \u03b3-GT-related GSH biosynthesis and GSSG burden eventually favoring vascular oxidative stress and dysfunction.",

     "abstract": "Aging alters sympathetic nervous system (SNS) regulation, although central mechanisms are not well understood. In young rats the rostral ventral lateral medulla (RVLM) is critically involved in central SNS regulation and RVLM neuronal activity is mediated by a balance of excitatory and inhibitory ionotropic neurotransmitters and receptors, providing the foundation for hypothesizing that with advanced age the molecular substrate of RVLM ionotropic receptors is characterized by upregulated excitatory and downregulated inhibitory receptor subunits. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the relative mRNA expression and protein concentration of RVLM excitatory (NMDA and AMPA) and inhibitory (GABA and glycinergic) ionotropic neurotransmitter receptor subunits in young and aged Fischer (F344) rats. Brains were removed from anesthetized rats and the RVLM-containing area was micropunched and extracted RNA and protein were subsequently used for TaqMan qRT-PCR gene expression and quantitative ELISA analyses. Bilateral chemical inactivation of RVLM neurons and peripheral ganglionic blockade on visceral sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) was determined in additional experiments. The relative gene expression of RVLM NMDA and AMPA glutamate-gated receptor subunits and protein concentration of select receptor subunits did not differ between young and aged rats, and there were no age-related differences in the expression of RVLM ionotropic GABAA and Gly receptors, or of protein concentration of select GABAA subunits. RVLM muscimol microinjections significantly reduced visceral SND by 70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% in aged F344 rats. Collectively these findings from this short communication support a functional role for the RVLM in regulation of sympathetic nerve outflow in aged rats, but provide no evidence for an ionotropic RVLM receptor-centric framework explaining age-associated changes in SNS regulation.",

     "abstract": "Exercise is known to have numerous beneficial effects. Recent studies indicate that exercise improves mitochondrial energetics not only in skeletal muscle but also in other tissues. While exercise elicits positive effects on memory, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, the effects of exercise on brain mitochondrial energetics remain relatively unknown. Herein, we studied the effects of exercise training in old and young mice on brain mitochondrial energetics, in comparison to known effects on peripheral tissues that utilize fatty acid oxidation. Exercise improved the capacity for muscle and liver to oxidize palmitate in old mice, but not young mice. In the brain, exercise increased rates of respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the old group only while utilizing complex I substrates, effects that were not seen in the young group. Coupled complex I to III enzymatic activity was significantly increased in old trained versus untrained mice with no effect on coupled II to III enzymatic activity. Mitochondrial protein content and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1\u03b1 and TFAM) were not affected by exercise training in the brain, in contrast to the skeletal muscle of old mice. Brain levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II and protein levels of other signaling proteins that regulate metabolism or transport (BDNF, HSP60, phosphorylated mTOR, FNDC5, SIRT3) were not significantly altered. Old exercised mice showed a significant increase in DRP1 protein levels in the brain without changes in phosphorylation, while MFN2 and OPA1 protein levels were unchanged. Our results suggest that exercise training in old mice can improve brain mitochondrial function through effects on electron transport chain function and mitochondrial dynamics without increasing mitochondrial biogenesis.",

Individuals can adjust their behavior and molecular physiology based on early life experiences but relatively few studies have connected such mechanisms to demographic patterns in social organisms. Sociality buffers individuals from environmental influences and it is unclear how much early life stress affects later life history. Workers of the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) were exposed to two stressors, Varroa parasitism and Paraquat exposure, early in life. Consequences were measured at the molecular, behavioral, and demographic level. While treatments did not significantly affect levels of oxidative damage, expression of select genes, and titers of the common deformed wing virus, most of these measures were affected by age. Some of the age effects, such as declining levels of deformed wing virus and oxidative damage, were opposite to our predictions but may be explained by demographic selection. Further analyses suggested some influences of worker behavior on mortality and indicated weak treatment effects on behavior. The latter effects were inconsistent among the two experiments. However, mortality rate was consistently reduced by Varroa mite stress during development. Thus, mortality was more responsive to early life stress than our other response variables. The lack of treatment effects on these measures may be due to the social organization of honey bees that buffers the individual from the impact of stressful developmental conditions.",

     "abstract": "Populations of laboratory animals that are selected for increased lifespan often show negative correlated responses in early fecundity. However, late fecundity and/or total lifetime fecundity can be higher in the populations selected for increased lifespan. This has been interpreted by some as being at odds with the disposable soma theory, which predicts decreased lifespan to increase total reproductive output. Alternatively, the Y\u2013model explores the effects of variation in resource allocation and acquisition on life histories. In this model, a negative relationship between lifespan and reproduction can be viewed as variation in allocation, whereas a positive relationship is the result of variation in acquisition. However, a frequently neglected complication of the Y-model is that older individuals often show a decline in resource acquisition. Therefore, differential allocation to maintenance and survival might affect this decline in late-life acquisition which will affect resource availability across the whole lifespan. In this paper we show that a model which incorporates the ideas of the Y-model, the disposable soma theory, and an age-related decrease in resource acquisition, i.e. feeding senescence, can explain how the relationship between fecundity and lifespan changes with age. Furthermore, by modeling environments with contrasting extrinsic mortality rates, we explored how the outcome of the model depended on the relative importance of early and late-life reproduction. In high mortality environments a relatively higher early fecundity, lower late fecundity, and lower lifespans were more optimal, whereas the opposite was true for low mortality environments. We applied predictions from the model to a cohort of individually-housed female Drosophila melanogaster flies for which we measured age specific fecundity and lifespan. Early fecundity was negatively associated with lifespan, while late fecundity related positively with lifespan in the same cohort. This verified that the mechanism of feeding senescence could explain patterns for age specific relationships between lifespan and fecundity.",

Infected young animals displayed enhanced CD4+ T cells as compared to uninfected counterparts. Ageing also triggered a significant reduction in CD8+ T cells compared to young and uninfected groups. The percentage of spleen NKT cells was reduced for all groups, regardless of the infection status. Significant decreased B-cells was noted in aged controls and infected animals as compared to young counterparts. A significant decrease in MHC class II (RT1B) expression in all aged animals was observed, whether infected or not. The highest and significant levels of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) were noted in the aged and infected animals as compared to young-infected ones (16\u00a0day). Consequently superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was reduced for both control and infected aged animals. Significant elevation of 8-isoprostane levels was found in aged control and infected animals. Plasma glutathione (GSH) concentration was reduced in aged control animals, as well as, in the young infected animals. NO production was increased in both infected and uninfected aged animals compared to young infected and uninfected animals. Corticosterone levels were elevated in aged animals, whether infected or not. Thus, our results are inedited since the immune response is not worsened by the simple fact of animals being older. Ageing by itself triggered a damaged immune response as well as enhanced reactive oxygen species, when compared to young counterparts, but it did not contribute to impair the immune response of T. cruzi infected and aged rats.",

     "publication date": "04-2017",
     "abstract": "While ageing is frequently associated with l-arginine deficiency, clinical and experimental studies provided controversial data on the interest of a chronic l-arginine supplementation with beneficial, no or even deleterious effects. It was hypothesized that these discrepancies might relate to a deviation of l-arginine metabolism towards production of l-ornithine rather than nitric oxide as a result of age-induced increase in arginase activity. This study investigated the effect of ageing on arginase activity/expression in target tissues and determined whether l-arginine supplementation modulated the effect of ageing on arginase activity. Arginase activity and expression were measured in the heart, vessel, brain, lung, kidney and liver in young rats (3-months old) and aged Wistar rats (22\u201324-months-old) with or without l-arginine supplementation (2.25% in drinking water for 6\u00a0weeks). Plasma levels of l-arginine and l-ornithine were quantified in order to calculate the plasma l-arginine/l-ornithine ratio, considered as a reflection of arginase activity. Cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure, heart rate) and aortic vascular reactivity were also studied. Ageing dramatically reduced plasma l-arginine and l-arginine/l-ornithine ratio, decreased liver and kidney arginase activities but did not change activities in other tissues. l-Arginine supplementation normalized plasma l-arginine and l-arginine/l-ornithine ratio, improved endothelial function and decreased systolic blood pressure. These effects were associated with decreased arginase activity in aorta along with no change in the other tissues except in the lung in which activity was increased. A strong mismatch was therefore observed between arginase activity and expression in analyzed tissues. The present study reveals that ageing selectively changes arginase activity in clearance tissues, but does not support a role of the arginase pathway in the potential deleterious effect of the l-arginine supplementation in aged patients. Moreover, our data argue against the use of the measurement of plasma l-arginine/l-ornithine ratio to estimate arginase activity in aged patients.",

Erythrocytes and liver were used to determine lipid oxidative damage, determined by malondialdehyde (MDA); superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activities. Total plasma antioxidant capacity was examined by ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) and estrogen by radioimmunoassay. MT increased FRAP and did not change estrogen levels. Increased SOD and GPx, and reduced MDA were observed in both tissues studied. Increased CAT activity was observed only in the liver. We confirmed the hypothesis that MT was capable of minimizing oxidative stress in this period of life by modulating antioxidant defense.",

     "abstract": "Despite tremendous progress in finding genes that, when manipulated, affects lifespan, little is known about the genetics underlying natural variation in lifespan. While segregating genetic variants for lifespan has been notoriously difficult to find in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a complementary approach is to manipulate key genetic pathways in lines that differ in lifespan. If these candidate pathways are down regulated in long-lived lines, these lines can be predicted to respond less to pharmaceutical down-regulation of these pathways than short-lived lines. Experimental studies have identified the nutrient-sensing pathway TOR as a key regulator of lifespan in model organisms, and this pathway can effectively be down regulated using the drug rapamycin, which extends lifespan in all tested species. We expose short- and long-lived lines of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei to rapamycin, and investigate if long-lived lines, which are hypothesized to already have down-regulated TOR signaling, respond less to rapamycin. We found no interaction between line and rapamycin treatment, since rapamycin extended lifespan independent of the intrinsic lifespan of the lines. This shows that rapamycin is equally effective on long and short-lived lines, and suggests that the evolution of long life may involve more factors that down-regulation of TOR.",

     "abstract": "It is a well-described clinical phenomenon that females live longer than males, yet tend to experience greater levels of co-morbidity and disability. Females can therefore be considered both more frail (because they have poorer health status) and less frail (because they have a lower risk of mortality). This systematic review aimed to determine whether this ageing paradox is demonstrated when the Frailty Index (FI) is used to measure frailty.Medline, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched for observational studies that measured FI and mortality in community-dwellers over 65\u00a0years of age. In five-year age groups, meta-analysis determined the sex differences in mean FI (MD\u00a0=\u00a0mean FIfemale\u00a0\u2212\u00a0mean FImale) and mortality rate.Of 6482 articles screened, seven articles were included. Meta-analysis of data from five studies (37,426 participants) found that MD values were positive (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; MD range\u00a0=\u00a00.02\u20130.06) in all age groups, indicating that females had higher FI scores than males at all ages. This finding was consistent across individual studies. Heterogeneity was high (I2\u00a0=\u00a072.7%), reflecting methodological differences. Meta-analysis of mortality data (13,127 participants) showed that male mortality rates exceeded female mortality rates up until the 90 to 94-years age group. Individual studies reported higher mortality for males at each level of FI, and higher risk of death for males when controlling for age and FI.The pattern of sex differences in the FI and mortality of older adults was consistent across populations and confirmed a \u2018male-female health-survival paradox\u2019.",

Prophylactic intermittent fasting has been shown to extend lifespan and attenuate the progress and severity of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular (e.g. stroke and myocardial infarction), neurodegenerative (e.g. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) and cancerous diseases in animal models. Stroke is the second leading cause of death, and lifestyle risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity have been associated with elevated risks of stroke in humans. Recent studies have shown that prophylactic IF may mitigate tissue damage and neurological deficit following ischemic stroke by a mechanism(s) involving suppression of excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death pathways in animal stroke models. This review summarizes data supporting the potential hormesis mechanisms of prophylactic IF in animal models, and with a focus on findings from animal studies of prophylactic IF in stroke in our laboratory.",

This study aimed to explore the time course and the mechanisms underlying these changes.Serum samples were collected from 45 AD patients at the start of the study, and again 13\u00a0months later (n\u00a0=\u00a037). The control group was 22 healthy, older, adults. Enzyme activity was determined at two substrate concentrations to allow Michaelis-Menten analysis of the enzyme activity.The results indicated that there was decreased activity of ApA, ApB and ApN amongst AD patients but no difference in serum IRAP activity. There were no associations between enzyme activity and age, gender nor scores on psychomotor tests.Consideration of the data for the two time points for AD patients showed that the changes in ApB occurred at an early stage of the disease and persisted, whilst those of ApA and ApN only became apparent at later stages of the disease. Although differences in Michaelis-Menten parameters were not statistically significant, consideration of the values suggested that the decrease in ApB activity may be a result of changes in enzyme protein conformation, whilst that of ApN may be a consequence of decreased enzyme expression. Importantly, the different time courses of the effects and the differential changes in enzyme affinity and expression indicated that the observed changes with progression of AD were not a \u2018class effect\u2019 for serum aminopeptidases but were idiosyncratic for the individual enzymes.",

In neurons, the role of TOR is particularly important in the consolidation of long-term memory (LTM). One of the modulators of TOR is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which activates the TOR signaling pathway to promote protein synthesis, synapse strengthening, and the creation of new neural networks. We investigated the gene expression pattern of this pathway during memory consolidation in zebrafish of different ages. Our findings demonstrate that TOR activation in old animals occurs in the early phase of consolidation, and follows a pattern identical to that of BDNF expression. In younger animals, this increase in activation did not occur, and changes in BDNF expression were also not so remarkable. Furthermore, the expression of the main proteins regulated by the synthesis of TOR (i.e., 4EBP and p70S6K) remained identical to that of TOR in all age groups.",

Treadmill exercise inhibited dopaminergic neuron loss by promoting the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) and seemed to improve cell survival by reducing \u03b1-Syn expression. Most importantly, treadmill exercise increased expression of the mitochondrial import machinery proteins TOM-40, TOM-20, and TIM-23. This was associated with decreased \u03b1-Syn expression and subsequent upregulation of the mitochondrial proteins COX-I, COX-IV, and mtHSP70.

Recently, the autophagy pathway is thought to be critical to the process of PD. Therefore, the regulation of autophagy may be a potential strategy for PD treatment. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) has been reported to have neuroprotective effects through anti-apoptosis, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms in PD. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy system in MANF-mediated neuroprotection against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity. Our results showed that MANF protected SH-SY5Y cells against 6-OHDA-induced cell viability decrease and apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy. Mitochondrion damage and energetic dysfunction triggered by reactive oxidative stress (ROS) accumulation were also alleviated by MANF treatment. Furthermore, MANF downregulated phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor and regulator, but upregulated phosphorylation of Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) under energy depletion conditions, indicating AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway is involved in the autophagic inhibition of MANF. These results suggest that autophagic inhibition provides protective mechanism of MANF in 6-OHDA-induced SH-SY5Y cell death and this inhibition is associated with AMPK/mTOR pathway.",

This study involved 424 males and 426 females aged 70\u00a0years from the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS), having complete data on SUA and EF assessed by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and by intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent vasodilation, EDV) and sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent vasodilation, EIDV). Univariate and multivariate regression models obtained by backward selection from initial fully-adjusted models were built to assess the relationship between SUA and measures of EF in both genders.

Multivariate Cox regressions were used to estimate associations between BMI, weight change and mortality.Relative to normal weight, overweight was associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratios, HRs [95% confidence interval, 95% CI]: 0.57 [0.41, 0.78]) and cardiovascular mortality (0.52 [0.29, 0.93]), whereas obesity did not significantly decrease or increase the mortality risk. Furthermore, compared to weight stability, all types of weight change led to increased mortality risk, except small weight gain. Specifically, after adjustment for covariates and the initial weight, the HRs (95% CI) of large weight loss were 1.64 (1.15, 2.34) for all-cause mortality and 1.85 (1.10, 3.14) for cardiovascular mortality, and the HRs (95% CI) of large weight gain were 1.55 (1.01, 2.40) for all-cause mortality and 2.11 (1.04, 4.30) for cardiovascular mortality. Similar associations were observed when weight change was redefined in sensitivity analyses.Both BMI at baseline and weight change have independent U-shaped associations with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among older men with IGR.

In order to make this possible, new care models that take advantage of novel technologies for tracking important physiologic and safety parameters need to be developed and implemented. By thoughtfully doing so, it can be possible to seamlessly provide preventative interventions when and as needed, detect the earliest signs of aggravation of chronic conditions, or identify and respond to any emergency situations, such as falls or cardiac arrest. In contrast to current approaches, caring for elderly individuals in their homes based on a digital technology infrastructure could be effective and cost-saving.

Young (8-week-old) and adult (1-year-old) male C57BL/6J mice were fed diets with different levels of methionine (0.12%-MR, 0.84%-CD) for 12\u00a0weeks. Functional indicators of DNA methylation, including global methylation (GM), gene-specific methylation (GSM) and LINE-1 methylation; and biochemical factors affecting DNA methylation, SAH, SAM, and DNMT1 were assessed in different tissues. MR altered DNA methylation depending on the age of intervention. While MR had no effect on hepatic GM in young animals, it increased GM by 27% over CD in adults (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In comparison with young animals, hepatic GM levels were 17% lower in CD adults (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but not different in MR adults. The MR-induced increase in hepatic GM was associated with a 38% decrease in SAH levels in adults (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with SAH and GM levels being negatively correlated (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.33, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No changes were observed in DNMT protein levels in liver. In adipose tissue, MR caused a 6% decline in GM in adults (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), a corresponding 2-fold increase in SAH (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and a 2-fold decrease in DNMT1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). MR caused both increases and decreases in GSM of liver and adipose. No changes were observed in LINE-1. Together, these findings provide evidence for protective effects of MR diet on hepatic DNA hypomethylation in adults, apparently mediated by SAH. These findings also indicate that altered DNA methylation might be playing a role in benefits conferred by MR diet.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive decline. Clinical data suggests that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are risk factors for AD-related dementia and several clinical studies have demonstrated that AD patients show alterations in peripheral glucose regulation characterized by insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia) or hypoinsulinemia. Whether animal models of AD exhibit a pre-diabetic phenotype without additional dietary or experimental manipulation is unclear however, with contradictory data available. Further, most studies have not examined the time course of potential pre-diabetic changes relative to AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline. Thus, in this study we tested the hypothesis that a pre-diabetic phenotype (peripheral metabolic dysregulation) exists in the APP/PS1 transgenic model of AD under normal conditions and precedes AD-related pathology. Specifically, we examined glucose tolerance in male APP/PS1 mice on a C57BL/6J congenic background at 2, 4\u20136 and 8\u20139\u00a0months of age by assessing fasting glucose levels, glucose tolerance, plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity as well as the development of pathological characteristics of AD and verified that our APP/PS1 mice develop cognitive impairment. Here we show that APP/PS1 mice, compared to wild-type controls, exhibit a significant impairment in glucose tolerance during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) and a trend for increased fasting plasma insulin concentrations as early as 2\u00a0months of age, while extracellular A\u03b21\u201342 deposition occurs later and cognitive decline exists at 8\u20139\u00a0months of age. Moreover, APP/PS1 mice did not respond as well to exogenous insulin as the wild-type controls during an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ipITT). Taken together, these data reveal that male APP/PS1 mice on a C57BL/6J congenic background exhibit a pre-diabetic phenotype prior to the development of AD-like pathology and that this metabolic deficit persists when they exhibit neuropathology and cognitive decline. This raises the question of whether altered glucose regulation and insulin production/secretion could contribute to AD pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Studies investigating telomere length in association with cognitive decline, dementia, and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) have frequently found shorter telomeres to be associated with the development of AD and telomerase expression with pathological processes in AD. Human telomerase is constituted by two components: the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the telomerase RNA component (TERC). Genetic variation at the two loci has been investigated in relation to telomere length, longevity, and common diseases of advanced age, but not in relation to AD. We examined three polymorphisms of the TERT gene (VNTR MNS16A, rs2853691, rs33954691) and three polymorphisms of the TERC gene (rs12696304, rs3772190, rs16847897) in a sample of 220 AD patients and 146 controls. MNS16A LL genotype was found to be associated with an increased risk of AD only in males [interaction term adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a03.55 (95% CI 1.2\u201310.2)]. The three TERC single nucleotide polymorphisms are in strict linkage disequilibrium and their genotype combinations influenced the age at AD onset (AAO). The combined genotype GG-TT-CC was associated with a mean AAO six years lower (70.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7) than that associated with the other genotype combinations (76.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).The fact that the MNS16 L allele has been reported to lower TERT expression, and that the TERC alleles G, T, C (rs12696304, rs3772190, rs16847897 in this order have been repeatedly found associated with shorter LTL, seems to corroborate the hypothesis of a role of telomere length and telomerase in AD susceptibility.",

     "publication date": "02-2017",
     "abstract": "Cardiovascular alterations are the most prevalent cause of impaired physiological function in aged individuals with kidney being one the most affected organs. Aging-induced alterations in renal circulation are associated with a decrease in endothelium-derived relaxing factors such as nitric oxide (NO) and with an increase in contracting factors such as endothelin-1(ET-1). As caloric restriction (CR) exerts beneficial effects preventing some of the aging-induced alterations in cardiovascular system, the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of age and caloric restriction in the vascular response of renal arteries to ET-1 in aged rats. Vascular function was studied in renal arteries from 3-month-old Wistar rats fed ad libitum (3\u00a0m) and in renal arteries from 8-and 24-month-old Wistar rats fed ad libitum (8\u00a0m and 24\u00a0m), or subjected to 20% caloric restriction during their three last months of life (8\u00a0m-CR and 24\u00a0m-CR). The contractile response to ET-1 was increased in renal arteries from 8\u00a0m and 24\u00a0m compared to 3\u00a0m rats. ET-1-induced contraction was mediated by ET-A receptors in all experimental groups and also by ET-B receptors in 24\u00a0m rats. Caloric restriction attenuated the increased contraction to ET-1 in renal arteries from 8\u00a0m but not from 24\u00a0m rats possibly through NO release proceeding from ET-B endothelial receptors. In 24\u00a0m rats, CR did not attenuate the aging-increased response of renal arteries to ET-1, but it prevented the aging-induced increase in iNOS mRNA levels and the aging-induced decrease in eNOS mRNA levels in arterial tissue. In conclusion, aging is associated with an increased response to ET-1 in renal arteries that is prevented by CR in 8\u00a0m but not in 24\u00a0m rats.",

     "abstract": "Aging is a complex and multifactorial biological process that leads to the progressive deterioration of physiological systems, including the circadian system. In addition, oxidative stress has been associated with the aging of the normal brain and the development of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Even though, functional weakening of circadian rhythms and antioxidant function has been observed during aging, the mechanisms by which the circadian system signaling and oxidative stress are interrelated have not yet been elucidated. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the consequences of aging on the temporal organization of the antioxidant defense system and oxidative status as well as to analyze the endogenous clock activity, in the hippocampus of aged rats.Young adults (3-month-old) or older (22-month-old) male Holtzman rats were maintained under constant darkness conditions, during 15\u00a0days before the sacrifice. Levels of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mRNA and activity, reduced glutathione (GSH), lipoperoxidation (LPO) and BMAL1 protein were analyzed in hippocampus samples isolated every 4\u00a0h during a 24-h period. Locomotor activity was recorded during 20\u00a0days before the experiment.Our results show that aging modifies temporal patterns of CAT and GPx expression and activity in the hippocampus in a different way. On the one hand, it abolishes the oscillating CAT expression and specific enzymatic activity while, on the other, it increases the mesor of circadian GPx activity rhythm (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Additionally, we observed increased GSH (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and reduced LPO (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) levels in the hippocampus of aged rats. Moreover, the nocturnal locomotor activity was reduced in the older animals in comparison to the young adult rats (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Interestingly, the 22\u00a0month-old animals became arrhythmic and showed a marked fragmentation as well as a significant decline in daily locomotor activity when they were maintained under constant darkness conditions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Aging also abolished circadian rhythms of the core clock BMAL1 protein.The loss of temporal organization of the antioxidant enzymes activity, the oxidative status and the cellular clock machinery could result in a temporally altered antioxidant defense system in the aging brain. Learning about how aging affects the circadian system and the expression of genes involved in the antioxidant defense system could contribute to the design of new strategies to improve the quality of life of older people and also to promote a healthy aging.",

Stress regulatory systems are adaptive to challenge and change, allostasis, until demands exceed the adaptive capacity contributing to dysregulation, resulting in a high allostatic load. A high allostatic load is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Pain severity, based on the average intensity of frequent pain, was hypothesized to be positively associated with AL. Four formulations of AL were investigated. Cross-sectional data from Wave 4 (2008\u20132009) of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) were analyzed. Covariates in the model included age, sex, education, smoking status, alcohol consumption, activity level, depression and common comorbid health conditions. A total of 5341 individuals were included; mean age 65.3(\u00b1\u00a09.2) years, 55% female, 62.4% infrequent or no pain, 12.6% mild pain, 19.1% moderate pain, and 5.9% severe pain. Severe pain was associated with greater AL defined by all four formulations. The amount of variance explained by pain severity and the covariates was highest when allostatic load was defined by the high risk quartile (12.9%) and by the clinical value (11.7%). Findings indicate a positive relationship between pain severity and AL. Further investigation is needed to determine if there is a specific AL signature for pain that differs from other health conditions.",

However, comparative wheel-running activity profiles of male and female mice for a long period of time in which increasing age plays an additional role are unknown. Therefore, we permanently recorded the wheel-running activity (i.e., total distance, median velocity, time of breaks) of female and male mice until 9\u00a0months of age. Our records indicated higher wheel-running distances for females than males which were highest in 2-month-old mice. This was mainly reached by higher running velocities of the females and not by longer running times. However, the sex-related differences declined in parallel to the age-associated reduction in wheel-running activities. Female mice also showed more variances between the weekly running distances than males, which were recorded most often for females being 4\u20136\u00a0months old but not older. Additional records of 24-month-old mice of both sexes indicated highly reduced wheel-running activities at old age. Surprisingly, this reduction at old age resulted mainly from lower running velocities and not from shorter running times. Old mice also differed in their course of night activity which peaked later compared to younger mice. In summary, we demonstrated the influence of sex on the age-dependent activity profile of mice which is somewhat contrasting to humans, and this has to be considered when transferring exercise-mediated mechanism from mouse to human.",

For most elderly hypertensives a blood pressure goal below 150/90\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg still seems reasonable, even if a lower goal could be defended based on the recent SPRINT study outcomes. However, the debate on the methodologies for blood pressure measurement in SPRINT is still ongoing and this is why we have to wait until a new recommendation is available. It should not be forgotten that many elderly patients are frail and will therefore not tolerate blood pressure lowering similar to other more fit elderly subjects. This is why an individualised treatment strategy has to be developed for this age group, not to deny the fit elderly the benefits of appropriate blood pressure control, but at the same time avoiding harm and adverse effects in the frail elderly patient.",

Age-related decline in renal function is also a matter of gender, race and genetic background. Pathogenetically, mediators of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone (RAAS) system are relevant factors determining renal aging, due to an enhanced incidence of cellular damage combined with reduced repair capacities. In addition cardiovascular diseases play a significant role. Features of renal aging include several functional alterations, like reduction of glomerular filtration rate, sodium reabsorption, potassium secretion, vitamin D3 synthesis, titratable acid excretion, responsiveness to hormones, and regulatory flexibility.

     "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging, muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future, interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as well as by a direct effect on the aging process.",

Over the past 50\u00a0years, there have been dramatic improvements made in cardiac surgery processes and outcomes that allow for procedures to be performed on an increasingly older population with the goal of improving function. Although improved function is possible, major surgical procedures are associated with substantial stress, which can severely impact outcomes. Past literature has identified that frail patients, who are vulnerable to the stress of surgery, are more likely to have postoperative major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (OR 4.9, 95% confidence interval 1.6, 14.6). The objective of this manuscript is to examine preoperative frailty in biological, psychological, and social domains using cardiac surgery to induce stress. We systematically searched PubMed for keywords including \u201ccardiac surgery, frailty, and aged\u201d in addition to the biological, psychological, and social keywords. In the biological domain, we examine the association of physiological and physical vulnerabilities, as well as, the impact of comorbidities and inflammation on negative surgical outcomes. In the psychological domain, the impact of cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety as vulnerabilities were examined. In the social domain, social structure, coping, disparities, and addiction as vulnerabilities are described. Importantly, there is substantial overlap in the domains of vulnerability. While frailty research has largely focused on discrete physical vulnerability criteria, a broader definition of frailty demonstrates that vulnerabilities in biological, psychological, and social domains can limit recovery after the stress of cardiac surgery. Identification of vulnerability in these domains can allow better understanding of the risks of cardiac surgery and tailoring of interventions to improve outcomes.",

CRP and epidermal p16INK4a positivity were also associated with age, but with smaller estimates. Grip strength and the Stroop test were associated with cardiovascular or metabolic disease, as was epidermal p16INK4a positivity. All associations with cardiovascular or metabolic disease attenuated when adjusting for age.In conclusion, in middle-aged to old persons, the molecular measures tested here were more weakly associated with age and health status than functional capacity measures.

Some conditions might have a different meaning in certain groups of elderly subjects, like in frail people or older patients with heart failure. Cut-off values defining these conditions may require adjustment in such groups. Indeed, several such conditions (e.g. obesity and hypercholesterolemia) have been discussed recently in light of so-called paradoxical situations, which are - counter-intuitively - associated with better outcome instead of a negative impact on survival in the general population. Therefore, different cut-off values may be needed in some groups of older subjects. The pathophysiological mechanisms for these paradoxical situations need to be understood in at least two different ways, causal and non-causal. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of a variety of conditions (obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes) in which new cut-offs may have diagnostic, clinical, or prognostic value, focusing on heart failure as a chronic disease, which is frequently observed in older patients. Haemoglobin concentration may need a different cut-off in heart failure for a reason other than paradox. Namely, underlying iron deficiency itself, both in those with or without anaemia, can have effects on symptoms and quality of life.

     "abstract": "Reproduction is a critical and demanding phase of an animal's life. In mammals, females usually invest much more in parental care than males, and lactation is the most energetically demanding period of a female's life. Here, we tested whether oxidative stress is a consequence of reproduction in the brains of female Wistar rats. We evaluated the activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase; H2O2 consumption; protein carbonylation; NO2 & NO3 levels; and total glutathione, as well as sex hormone levels in brain tissue of animals at 3, 6, 12, and 24\u00a0months of age. Animals were grouped according to reproductive experience: breeders or non-breeders. Most of the studied parameters showed a difference between non-breeders and breeders at 12 and 24\u00a0months. At 24\u00a0months of age, breeders showed higher superoxide dismutase activity, H2O2 consumption, glutathione peroxidase activity, and carbonyl levels than non-breeders. In 12-month-old non-breeders, we observed a higher level of H2O2 consumption and higher superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities than breeders. By evaluating the correlation network, we found that there were a larger number of influential nodes and positive links in breeder animals than in non-breeders, indicating a greater number of redox changes in breeder animals. Here, we also demonstrated that the aging process caused higher oxidative damage and higher antioxidant defenses in the brains of breeder female rats at 24\u00a0months, suggesting that the reproduction process is costly, at least for the female brain. This study shows that there is a strong potential for a link between the cost of reproduction and oxidative stress.",

Spatial and recognition memories were assessed by the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tasks. Brain and blood of animals were analysed for oxidative stress biomarkers including malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Apoptosis rate in the hippocampus was evaluated by TUNEL staining of brain tissue.5 ml/kg/i.p. dose of CBL increased the locomotor activity but, 1 ml/kg/i.p. dose didn\u2019t show detectable behavioural or molecular effects on aged mice. Treatment with 2.5 ml/kg/i.p. and 1 ml/kg/i.n. doses attenuated d-galactose-impaired spatial and recognition memories.

Anti-apoptotic effects also were seen in the same dose/rout of CBL administration in aged animals.This study proves the usefulness of i.n.

We found that pretreatment with IGF-1 attenuated A\u03b225\u201335-induced loss of cell viability and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, IGF-1 inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased the antioxidant activity in A\u03b225\u201335-treated cells.

     "abstract": "Cholesterol has attracted significant attention as a possible lifespan regulator. It has been reported that serum cholesterol levels have an impact on mortality due to age-related disorders such as cardiovascular disease. Diet is also known to be an important lifespan regulator. Dietary restriction retards the onset of age-related diseases and extends lifespan in various organisms. Although cholesterol and dietary restriction are known to be lifespan regulators, it remains to be established whether cholesterol is involved in dietary restriction-induced longevity. Here, we show that cholesterol deprivation suppresses longevity induced by intermittent fasting, which is one of the dietary restriction regimens that effectively extend lifespan. We also found that cholesterol is required for the fasting-induced upregulation of transcriptional target genes such as the insulin/IGF-1 pathway effector DAF-16 and that cholesterol deprivation suppresses the long lifespan of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor daf-2 mutant. Remarkably, we found that cholesterol plays an important role in the fasting-induced nuclear accumulation of DAF-16. Moreover, knockdown of the cholesterol-binding protein NSBP-1, which has been shown to bind to DAF-16 in a cholesterol-dependent manner and to regulate DAF-16 activity, suppresses both fasting-induced longevity and DAF-16 nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, this suppression was not additive to the cholesterol deprivation-induced suppression, which suggests that NSBP-1 mediates, at least in part, the action of cholesterol to promote fasting-induced longevity and DAF-16 nuclear accumulation. These findings identify a novel role for cholesterol in the regulation of lifespan.",

     "abstract": "Given the increased concerns about the degenerative decline in the physical performance of the elderly, there is a need for developing effective strategies to suppress the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and functional capacity through a lifestyle intervention. This randomized controlled trial examined whether a combination of Korean mistletoe extract (KME) supplement and exercise affected muscle mass, muscle function, and targeted molecular expressions. Sixty-seven subjects aged 55\u201375\u00a0years were assigned to placebo, low-dose (1\u00a0g/d), or high-dose (2\u00a0g/d) of KME for 12\u00a0weeks. The body composition was significantly changed in the high-dose group during the intervention period as determined by skeletal muscle mass (P\u00a0=\u00a00.040), fat free mass (P\u00a0=\u00a00.042), soft lean mass (P\u00a0=\u00a00.023), skeletal muscle index (P\u00a0=\u00a00.041), fat-free mass index (P\u00a0=\u00a00.030), percent body fat (P\u00a0=\u00a00.044), and fat mass to lean mass ratio (P\u00a0=\u00a00.030). Knee strength was measured by Cybex, demonstrating a significant effect in the KME groups compared to the placebo group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.026 for peak torque and P\u00a0=\u00a00.057 for set total work), which was more pronounced after adjusting for age, gender, protein, and energy intake (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009 for peak torque and P\u00a0=\u00a00.033 for set total work). The dynamic balance ability was remarkably improved in the high-dose group over a 12-week period as determined by Timed \u201cUp and Go\u201d (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005 for fast walk test and P\u00a0=\u00a00.024 for ordinary walk test). Consistent with these results, RT-PCR, multiplex analyses, and immunocytofluorescence staining revealed that a high-dose KME supplementation was effective for suppressing intracellular pathways related to muscle protein degradation, but stimulating those related to myogenesis. In particular, significant differences were found in atrogin-1 mRNA (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002 at a single administration and P\u00a0=\u00a00.001 at a 12-week administration), myogenin mRNA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 at a single administration and P\u00a0=\u00a00.040 at a 12-week administration), and insulin growth factor 1 receptor phosphorylation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002 at a 12-week administration).

Recent studies demonstrate a decline in plasma HMB concentrations in humans across the lifespan, and HMB supplementation may be able to preserve muscle mass and strength in older adults. However, the impact of HMB supplementation on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this study was to simultaneously evaluate the impact of HMB on muscle strength, neurogenesis and cognition in young and aged mice. In addition, we evaluated the influence of HMB on muscle-resident mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (Sca-1+\u00a0CD45\u2212; mMSC) function to address these cells potential to regulate physiological outcomes. Three month-old (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and 24 month-old (n\u00a0=\u00a018) female C57BL/6 mice were provided with either Ca-HMB or Ca-Lactate in a sucrose solution twice per day for 5.5\u00a0weeks at a dose of 450\u00a0mg/kg body weight. Significant decreases in relative peak and mean force, balance, and neurogenesis were observed in aged mice compared to young (age main effects, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Short-term HMB supplementation did not alter activity, balance, neurogenesis, or cognitive function in young or aged mice, yet HMB preserved relative peak force in aged mice. mMSC gene expression was significantly reduced with age, but HMB supplementation was able to recover expression of select growth factors known to stimulate muscle repair (HGF, LIF). Overall, our findings demonstrate that while short-term HMB supplementation does not appear to affect neurogenesis or cognitive function in young or aged mice, HMB may maintain muscle strength in aged mice in a manner dependent on mMSC function.",

The lifespan of eusocial insects is determined by features of the division of labor, which itself is influenced by social regulatory mechanisms. In the honey bee, Apis mellifera, the presence of brood and of old workers carrying out foraging tasks are important social drivers of ageing, but the influence of young adult workers is unknown, as it has not been experimentally teased apart from that of brood. In this study, we test the role of young workers in the ageing of their nestmates. We measured the impact of different social contexts characterized by the absence of brood and/or young adults on the lifespan of worker nestmates in field colonies. To acquire insight into the physiological processes occurring under these contexts, we analyzed the expression of genes known to affect honey bee ageing. The data showed that young workers significantly reduced the lifespan of nestmate workers, similar to the effect of brood on its own. Differential expression of vitellogenin, major royal jelly protein-1, and methylase transferase, but not methyl farneosate epoxidase genes suggests that young workers and brood influence ageing of adult nestmate workers via different physiological pathways. We identify young workers as an essential part of the social regulation of ageing in honey bee colonies.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the loss of muscle featuring both aging and cancer cachexia (CC). Whether mitochondrial quality control (MQC) is altered in skeletal myocytes of old patients with CC is unclear. The present investigation therefore sought to preliminarily characterize MQC pathways in muscle of old gastric cancer patients with cachexia. The study followed a case-control cross-sectional design. Intraoperative biopsies of the rectus abdominis muscle were obtained from 18 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (nine with CC and nine non-cachectic) and nine controls, and assayed for the expression of a set of MQC mediators. The mitofusin 2 expression was reduced in cancer patients compared with controls, independent of CC. Fission protein 1 was instead up-regulated in CC patients relative to the other groups. The mitophagy regulators PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 and Parkin were both down-regulated in cancer patients compared with controls. The ratio between the protein content of the lipidated and non-lipidated forms of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B was lower in CC patients relative to controls and non-cachectic cancer patients. Finally, the expression of autophagy-associated protein 7, lysosome-associated membrane protein 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A was unvarying among groups. Collectively, our findings indicate that, in old patients with gastric cancer, cachexia is associated with derangements of the muscular MQC axis at several checkpoints: mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial tagging for disposal, and mitophagy signaling. Further investigations are needed to corroborate these preliminary findings and determine whether MQC pathways may become target for future interventions.",

While the loss and recovery of single myofiber specific force (SF) following disuse and rehabilitation has been shown to correlate with alterations in myosin concentrations in young, it is unknown whether similar relationships exist in old. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of 14\u00a0days lower limb disuse followed by 28\u00a0days of active recovery on single muscle fiber myosin content in old (68\u00a0yrs) and young (24\u00a0yrs) recreationally physically active healthy men. Following disuse, myosin content decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in MHC 1 (young \u2212\u00a028%, old \u2212\u00a019%) and 2a fibers (young \u2212\u00a023%, old \u2212\u00a032%). In old, myosin content decreased more (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in MHC 2a vs 1 fibers. Following recovery, myosin content increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and returned to pre-disuse levels for both young and old in both fiber types, with MHC 2a fibers demonstrating an overshooting in young (+\u00a031%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but not old. Strong correlations were observed between myosin content and single fiber SF in both young and old, with greater slope steepness in MHC 2a vs 1 fibers indicating an enhanced intrinsic contractile capacity of MHC 2a fibers. In conclusion, adaptive changes in myofiber myosin content appear to occur rapidly following brief periods of disuse (2\u00a0wks) and after subsequent active recovery (4\u00a0wks) in young and old, which contribute to alterations in contractile function at the single muscle fiber level.

LM B cells, but not IgM memory B cells, activate a p38MAPK signaling pathway, downstream of AMPK, leading to the expression of SASP mediators, while class switch recombination is downregulated. These data show that some B cell subsets are more inflammatory than others, that they are pre-activated and that this signaling through metabolic pathways is associated with a senescence phenotype, demonstrating for the first time in human B lymphocytes the link between aging, cellular senescence, SASP and metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Natural compounds in grapes such as resveratrol are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Some studies have shown a potential role for grapes or wine in slowing cognitive decline and other effects of aging. However, well-controlled experimental data obtained in human subjects are still in need of further development. Here we aimed to systematically assess effects of grapes on regional cerebral metabolism.Ten subjects with mild decline in cognition (mean, 72.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7\u00a0years; 50% female) were included in this analysis. Participants were randomized into an active grape formulation arm or a placebo arm which consumed a formulation free of polyphenols for six months. Cognitive performance was measured through neuropsychological assessments performed at baseline and 6\u00a0months after initiation of therapy. Changes in brain metabolism occurring with each therapy regimen were assessed by brain PET scans with the radiotracer [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), obtained during initial evaluation and 6\u00a0months later. Standardized volumes of interest (sVOI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) methods were applied to FDG-PET scans to identify significant regional cerebral metabolic changes.In contrast to participants taking the active grape formulation, who displayed no significant decline in metabolism, the placebo arm underwent significant metabolic decline in sVOI's of the right posterior cingulate cortex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and left superior posterolateral temporal cortex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). SPM analyses also found significant declines in the placebo group, particularly in left prefrontal, cingulate, and left superior posterolateral temporal cortex (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) with stable brain metabolism in the active formulation arm. No significant differences were seen in scores on the neuropsychological battery of tests between the two groups. However, metabolism in right superior parietal cortex and left inferior anterior temporal cortex was correlated with improvements in attention/working memory, as measured with WAIS-III Digital Span within the active formulation group (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.69, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).The placebo arm had declines in regions of the brain known to be significantly affected in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, while the active formulation group was spared such decline. This suggests a protective effect of grapes against early pathologic metabolic decline.",

     "abstract": "Possession of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene \u03b54 allele is the most prevalent genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence suggests that APOE genotype differentially affects the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Notably, aerobic exercise-induced upregulation of BDNF is well documented; and exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function. As BDNF is known for its role in neuroplasticity and survival, its upregulation is a proposed mechanism for the neuroprotective effects of physical exercise. In this pilot study designed to analyze exercise-induced BDNF upregulation in an understudied population, we examined the effects of APOE\u03b54 (\u03b54) carrier status on changes in BDNF expression after a standardized exercise program. African Americans, age 55\u00a0years and older, diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment participated in a six-month, supervised program of either stretch (control treatment) or aerobic (experimental treatment) exercise. An exercise-induced increase in VO2Max was detected only in male participants. BDNF levels in serum were measured using ELISA. Age, screening MMSE scores and baseline measures of BMI, VO2Max, and BDNF did not differ between \u03b54 carriers and non-\u03b54 carriers. A significant association between \u03b54 status and serum BDNF levels was detected. Non-\u03b54 carriers showed a significant increase in BDNF levels at the 6\u00a0month time point while \u03b54 carriers did not. We believe we have identified a relationship between the \u03b54 allele and BDNF response to physiologic adaptation which likely impacts the extent of neuroprotective benefit gained from engagement in physical exercise. Replication of our results with inclusion of diverse racial cohorts, and a no-exercise control group will be necessary to determine the scope of this association in the general population.",

     "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant risk factor in the development of cognitive decline. However, the exact role of CKD in cognitive impairment or dementia is unclear. This work was performed to examine the potential impact of CKD on cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on angiotensin II. (1) CKD was induced in 5XFAD mice, an AD model mouse, and wild-type mice by feeding an adenine-containing diet and the effect on cognitive function was compared between both strains. There was no significant difference regarding the severity of CKD induced by adenine between the strains. In 5XFAD mice, the CKD group exhibited significant cognitive impairment while the control group (control diet-fed group) did not, as evidenced by a passive avoidance test. On the other hand, in wild-type mice, neither the CKD group nor the control group showed cognitive impairment. Thus, CKD itself appears to accelerate cognitive impairment in AD mice. (2) We also examined the effect of olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, on 5XFAD mice with CKD to elucidate the potential involvement of angiotensin II. As evidenced by the findings of the water maze test, olmesartan treatment significantly ameliorated the impairment of spatial learning and memory function induced by CKD in 5XFAD mice. Olmesartan treatment significantly ameliorated blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption induced by CKD in 5XFAD mice. Furthermore, olmesartan reduced hippocampal oxidative stress in 5XFAD with CKD to similar levels to the control group of 5XFAD fed standard diet. Hence, the amelioration of CKD-induced cognitive impairment in 5XFAD mice by olmesartan appears to be mediated by the suppression of BBB disruption or oxidative stress. In conclusion, we obtained the evidence suggesting that CKD itself accelerates cognitive impairment in AD mice, through angiotensin II. Thus, our work provides a novel insight into the underlying mechanism of the link between CKD and AD.",

The older adult population is the fastest growing segment of the US population and a greater proportion of them are entering old age obese. These older adults require treatments based on solid evidence. Therefore the purpose of this review is three-fold: 1) to provide a more current status of the knowledge regarding recommendations of calorie restriction as part of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss in obese older adults, 2) to determine what benefits and/or risks calorie restriction adds to exercise interventions in obese older adults, and 3) to consider not only outcomes related to changes in body composition, bone health, cardiometabolic disease risk, markers of inflammation, and physical function, but, also patient-centered outcomes that evaluate changes in cognitive status, quality of life, out-of-pocket costs, and mortality. Seven randomized controlled trials were identified that examined calorie restriction while controlling for exercise intervention effects. Overall, the studies found that calorie restriction combined with exercise is effective for weight loss. Evidence was mixed regarding other outcomes. The risk\u2013benefit ratio regarding calorie restriction in older adults remains uncertain. Greater long-term follow-up is necessary, and complementary effectiveness studies are needed to identify strategies currently used by obese older adults in community settings.",

Data from NHANES I were used to fit a \u201ctrue\u201d model treating BMI as a continuous variable. Coefficients estimated from this model were used to simulate mortality for participants in NHANES III. Hence, the population-level association between BMI and mortality in NHANES III was fixed to be identical to the association estimated in NHANES I. Hazard ratios (HRs) for obesity categories based on BMI for NHANES III with simulated mortality data were compared to the corresponding estimated HRs from NHANES I.Change in hazard ratios for simulated data in NHANES III compared to observed estimates from NHANES I.On average, hazard ratios for NHANES III based on simulated mortality data were 29.3% lower than the estimates from NHANES I using observed mortality follow-up. This reduction accounted for roughly three-fourths of the apparent decrease in the obesity-mortality association observed in a previous analysis of these data.Some of the apparent diminution of the association between obesity and mortality may be an artifact of treating BMI as a categorical variable.",

     "publication date": "12-2016",
     "abstract": "Almost exactly 100\u00a0years ago Osborne and colleagues demonstrated that restricting the food intake of a small number of female rats extended their lifespan. In the 1930s experiments on the impact of diet on lifespan were extended by Slonaker, and subsequently McCay. Slonaker concluded that there was a strong impact of protein intake on lifespan, while McCay concluded that calories are the main factor causing differences in lifespan when animals are restricted (Calorie restriction or CR). Hence from the very beginning the question of whether food restriction acts on lifespan via reduced calorie intake or reduced protein intake was disputed. Subsequent work supported the idea that calories were the dominant factor. More recently, however, this role has again been questioned, particularly in studies of insects. Here we review the data regarding previous studies of protein and calorie restriction in rodents. We show that increasing CR (with simultaneous protein restriction: PR) increases lifespan, and that CR with no PR generates an identical effect. None of the residual variation in the impact of CR (with PR) on lifespan could be traced to variation in macronutrient content of the diet. Other studies show that low protein content in the diet does increase median lifespan, but the effect is smaller than the CR effect. We conclude that CR is a valid phenomenon in rodents that cannot be explained by changes in protein intake, but that there is a separate phenomenon linking protein intake to lifespan, which acts over a different range of protein intakes than is typical in CR studies. This suggests there may be a fundamental difference in the responses of insects and rodents to CR. This may be traced to differences in the physiology of these groups, or reflect a major methodological difference between \u2018restriction\u2019 studies performed on rodents and insects. We suggest that studies where the diet is supplied ad libitum, but diluted with inert components, should perhaps be called dietary or caloric dilution, rather than dietary or caloric restriction, to distinguish these potentially important methodological differences.",

In the current study we examined the effects that different diets high in carbohydrate, protein or fat content, but similar in caloric value, have on the development of cognitive impairment and brain pathology in wild-type and Tg AD model mice. The results demonstrate that long term feeding with balanced diets similar in caloric content but with significant changes in the source of calories, all negatively influence cognition compared to the control diet, and that this effect is more pronounced in Tg animals with AD pathology.",

We suggest that a greater emphasis on ecology can help to remedy this, by focusing on the interface between biological mechanisms and the environments in which they evolved by natural selection. Among the most salient aspects of the environment relevant to aging is nutrition, and yet in the bulk of aging research nutrition is coarsely represented as dietary restriction or caloric restriction, without consideration for how specific components of diet, beyond \u201cenergy\u201d (the undifferentiated mix of macronutrients), are driving the observed effects. More recently, it has become clear that specific nutrients (notably amino acids) and interactions among nutrients (i.e., nutritional balance) play important roles in the biology of aging. We show how a method developed in nutritional ecology, called the Geometric Framework for nutrition, can help to understand the nutritional interactions of animals with their environments, by explicitly distinguishing the roles of calories, individual nutrients and nutrient balance. Central to these models are the active regulatory responses that animals use to mediate between variation in the nutritional environment and fitness-related consequences such as lifespan and reproduction. These homeostatic responses provide a guide for researchers that can help to link the biological mechanisms with evolutionary processes in the context of a multi-dimensional nutritional environment.",

     "abstract": "Experimental studies on energetics and aging often remove two major factors that in part regulate the energy budget in a normal healthy individual: reproduction and fluctuating environmental conditions that challenge homeostasis. Here we use the cyclical parthenogenetic Daphnia pulex to evaluate the role of a fluctuating thermal environment on both reproduction and lifespan across six food concentrations. We test the hypotheses that (1) caloric restriction extends lifespan; (2) maximal reproduction will come with a cost of shortened lifespan; and (3) at a given food concentration, relative to a metabolically equivalent constant temperature environment a diel fluctuating thermal environment will alter the allocation of energy to reproduction and lifespan to maintain homeostasis. We did not identify a level of food concentration that extended lifespan in response to caloric restriction, and we found no cost of reproduction in terms of lifespan. Rather, the individuals at the highest food levels generally had the highest reproductive output and the longest lifespans, the individuals at the intermediate food level decreased reproduction and maintained lifespan, and the individuals at the three lower food concentrations had a decrease in reproduction and lifespan as would be predicted with increasing levels of starvation. Fluctuating temperature had no effect on lifespan at any food concentration, but delayed time to reproductive maturity and decreased early reproductive output at all food concentrations. This suggests that a fluctuating temperature regimen activates molecular pathways that alter energy allocation. The costs of fluctuating temperature on reproduction were not consistent across the lifespan. Statistical interactions for age of peak reproduction and lifetime fecundity suggest that senescence of the reproductive system may vary between temperature regimens at the different food concentrations.",

     "abstract": "Several behavioral and pharmacological strategies improve longevity, which is indicative of delayed organismal aging, with the most effective interventions extending both life- and healthspan. In free living creatures, maintaining health and function into old age requires resilience against a multitude of stressors. Conversely, in experimental settings, conventional housing of rodents limits exposure to such challenges, thereby obscuring an accurate assessment of resilience. Caloric restriction (CR) and exercise, as well as pharmacologic strategies (resveratrol, rapamycin, metformin, senolytics), are well established to improve indices of health and aging, but some paradoxical effects have been observed on resilience. For instance, CR potently retards the onset of age-related diseases, and improves lifespan to a greater extent than exercise in a variety of models. However, exercise has proven more consistently beneficial to organismal resilience against a broad array of stressors, including infections, surgery, wound healing and frailty. CR can improve cellular stress defenses and protect from frailty, but also impairs the response to infections, bed rest and healing. How an intervention will impact not only longevity, health and function, but also resiliency, is critical to better understanding translational implications. Thus, organismal robustness represents a critical, albeit understudied aspect of aging, which needs more careful attention in order to better inform on how putative age-delaying strategies will impact preservation of health and function in response to stressors with aging in humans.",

It is clear that genetics can play a critical role \u2014 perhaps just as important as diet choices. For example, poor diet in combination with genetic susceptibility can lead to metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

     "abstract": "Research into the genetic mechanisms of aging has expanded rapidly over the past two decades. This has in part been the result of the use of model organisms (particularly yeast, worms and flies) and high-throughput technologies, combined with a growing interest in aging research. Despite this progress, widespread consensus regarding the pathways that are fundamental to the modulation of cellular aging and lifespan for all organisms has been limited due to discrepancies between different studies. We have compared results from published genome-wide, chronological lifespan (CLS) screens of individual gene deletion strains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to identify gene deletion strains with consistent influences on longevity as possible indicators of fundamental aging processes from this single-celled, eukaryotic model organism.Three previous reports have described genetic modifiers of chronological aging in the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) using the yeast gene deletion strain collection. We performed a comparison among the data sets using correlation and decile distribution analysis to describe concordance between screens and identify strains that consistently increased or decreased CLS. We used gene enrichment analysis in an effort to understand the biology underlying genes identified in multiple studies. We attempted to replicate the different experimental conditions employed by the screens to identify potential sources of variability in CLS worth further investigating.Among 3209 strains present in all three screens, nine deletions strains were in common in the longest-lived decile (2.80%) and thirteen were in common in the shortest-lived decile (4.05%) of all three screens. Similarly, pairwise overlap between screens was low. When the same comparison was extended to three deciles to include more mutants studied in common between the three screens, enrichment of cellular processes based on gene ontology analysis in the long-lived strains remained very limited. To test the hypothesis that different parental strain auxotrophic requirements or media formulations employed by the respective genome-wide screens might contribute to the lack of concordance, different CLS assay conditions were assessed in combination with strains having different ploidy and auxotrophic requirements (all relevant to differences in the way the three genome-wide CLS screens were performed). This limited but systematic analysis of CLS with respect to auxotrophy, ploidy, and media revealed several instances of gene-nutrient interaction.There is surprisingly little overlap between the results of three independently performed genome-wide screens of CLS in S. cerevisiae. However, differences in strain genetic background (ploidy and specific auxotrophic requirements) were present, as well as different media and experimental conditions (e.g., aeration and pooled vs. individual culturing), which, along with stochastic effects such as genetic drift or selection of secondary mutations that suppress the loss of function from gene deletion, could in theory account for some of the lack of consensus between results. Considering the lack of overlap in CLS phenotypes among the set of genes reported by all three screens, and the results of a CLS experiment that systematically tested (incorporating extensive controls) for interactions between variables existing between the screens, we propose that discrepancies can be reconciled through deeper understanding of the influence of cell intrinsic factors such as auxotrophic requirements ploidy status, extrinsic factors such as media composition and aeration, as well as interactions that may occur between them, for example as a result of different pooling vs. individually aging cultures. Such factors may have a more significant impact on CLS outcomes than previously realized. Future studies that systematically account for these contextual factors, and can thus clarify the interactions between genetic and nutrient factors that alter CLS phenotypes, should aid more complete understanding of the underlying biology so that genetic principles of CLS in yeast can be extrapolated to differential cellular aging observed in animal models.",

     "abstract": "The epigenetic regulation of DNA structure and function is essential for changes in gene expression involved in development, growth, and maintenance of cellular function. Epigenetic changes include histone modifications such as methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins have a major role in epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. HDACs are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues within histones, as well as a range of other proteins including transcriptional factors. HDACs are highly conserved proteins divided into two families and based on sequence similarity in four classes. Here we will discuss the roles of Rpd3 in physiology and longevity with emphasis on its role in flies. Rpd3, the Drosophila HDAC1 homolog, is a class I lysine deacetylase and a member of a large family of HDAC proteins. Rpd3 has multiple functions including control of proliferation, development, metabolism, and aging. Pharmacological and dietary HDAC inhibitors have been used as therapeutics in psychiatry, cancer, and neurology.",

Sarcopenia represents an important public health problem, being closely linked to a condition of frailty and, therefore, of disability. According to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People, the diagnosis of sarcopenia requires the presence of low muscle mass, along with either low grip strength or low physical performance. However, age-related changes in skeletal muscle can be largely attributed to the complex interactions among factors including alterations of the neuromuscular junction, endocrine system, growth factors, and muscle proteins turnover, behavior-related and disease-related factors. Accordingly, the identification of a single biomarker of sarcopenia is unreliable, due to its \u201cmultifactorial\u201d pathogenesis with the involvement of a multitude of pathways. Thus, in order to characterize pathophysiological mechanisms and to make a correct assessment of elderly patient with sarcopenia, a panel of biomarkers of all pathways involved should be assessed.",

     "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Despite a significant reduction in the mortality and morbidity rates over the last decade, the socio-economic burden of cardiovascular disease is still substantial. Consequently, there is a considerable need for alternative strategies, such as nutraceutical supplementation, that delay the functional vascular decline present in the elderly. Compromised autophagy and oxidative stress (OS) are considered major causes of the age-related endothelial dysfunction. OS reduces the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), which has been associated with hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and a reduced vasodilatory response. High levels of free radicals and the low bioavailability of NO lead to a positive feedback loop of further OS, organelle damage, poor repair, and endothelial dysfunction. Here we draw attention to the relationship between OS and autophagy in the aged vasculature. We have reviewed the published literature and provided arguments that support that treatment with resveratrol stimulates autophagy and thereby has the potential to restore oxidative balance in the endothelium, which indicates that treatment with resveratrol might have therapeutic potential to restore endothelial function in the elderly.",

     "abstract": "Increasing duration of type 1 diabetes mellitus alters bone metabolism. Clinical studies and experimental studies in long bones of rats with experimentally induced diabetes have reported a decrease in bone density. Few studies have explored this diabetes related alteration in the maxillae. Given that this finding could indicate the possible development of osteopenia in the maxilla in the long term, the present study sought to analyze alterations in alveolar bone in aged rats, 12, 18, and 24\u00a0weeks after inducing diabetes, and compare alveolar bone response to that of tibial subchondral bone at the same experimental times. Thirty-six male Wistar rats, 130\u00a0g body weight, were divided into 2 groups: an experimental group (E) receiving a single i.p. 60\u00a0mg/kg dose of streptozotocin, and a control group (C). Both the control and experimental groups were divided into 3 sub-sets, according to the time of euthanasia: 12, 18 and 24\u00a0weeks. The alveolar bone and tibiae were examined histologically and histomorphometrically. The results were analyzed using Student's t-test; a value of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Subchondral bone volume and bone activity/remodeling, mainly bone rest, were significantly lower in diabetic animals compared to controls, at both 12 and 18\u00a0weeks. No differences in alveolar bone parameters were observed between diabetic and control animals at either of the experimental times. Animals surviving at 24\u00a0weeks showed few trabeculae at rest and severe destruction of dental and periodontal tissues. The results of the present study show that diabetic osteopenia is evident in the tibia at 12 and at 18\u00a0weeks, whereas its effects on the maxilla can be seen at 24\u00a0weeks, with substantial destruction of alveolar bone and of the remaining periodontal and dental tissues. All the above observations highlight the need for preventive oral care in diabetic patients, before irreversible damage to dental and periodontal tissues occurs.",

The cognitive assessment included the Mini Mental State Examination. Braking performance was measured using a driving simulator.Older adults exhibited 17% slower braking time, lower strength, and poorer performance in the postural balance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). For both older and middle-aged adults, significant correlates of braking time included performance in the postural balance tests, muscle strength, and cognitive function. However, after full model adjustment, only postural balance and cognitive function were significantly associated.Muscle strength, postural balance, and cognition are associated with braking time, and may affect the safety of and driving performance in older adults. These findings may help to inform specific targeted interventions that could preserve driving performance during aging.",

     "abstract": "Eusociality has been recognized as a strong driver of lifespan evolution. While queens show extraordinary lifespans of 20\u00a0years and more, worker lifespan is short and variable. A recent comparative study found that in eusocial species with larger average colony sizes the disparities in the lifespans of the queen and the worker are also greater, which suggests that lifespan might be an evolved trait. Here, we tested whether the same pattern holds during colony establishment: as colonies grow larger, worker lifespan should decrease. We studied the mortality of lab-reared Lasius niger workers from colonies at two different developmental stages (small and intermediate-sized) in a common garden experiment. Workers were kept in artificial cohorts that differed only with respect to the stage of the colony they were born in. We found that the stage of the birth colony affected the body size and the survival probability of the workers. The workers that had emerged from early stage colonies were smaller and had lower mortality during the first 400\u00a0days of their life than the workers born in colonies at a later stage. Our results suggest that early stage colonies produce small workers with an increased survival probability. These workers are gradually augmented by larger workers with a decreased survival probability that serve as a redundant workforce with easily replaceable individuals. We doubt that the observed differences in lifespan are driven by differences in body size. Rather, we suspect that physiological mechanisms are the basis for the observed differences in lifespan.",

However, whether blood telomeres are correlated with telomeres in other parts of the body is not well known, especially during early life when telomere loss is expected to be most rapid. We investigated this question in Franklin's gulls (Leucophaeus pipixcan) by measuring telomere lengths in blood and several other tissues including: heart, liver, and skeletal muscle at the end of embryonic (n\u00a0=\u00a031) and post-natal development (n\u00a0=\u00a020). In late-stage embryos, blood telomeres were significantly positively correlated with heart and skeletal muscle, but not liver telomeres. However, at the end of post-natal development, there were no significant correlations among blood telomeres and telomeres in any other tissues. In late-stage embryos, heart telomeres were significantly longer than blood, liver, and skeletal muscle telomeres, but at the end of post-natal development telomere lengths did not significantly differ among tissues. These results suggest that blood telomere length is not necessarily indicative of other tissues at all stages of development and highlights the importance of understanding any functional consequences of tissue specific telomere dynamics in early life.",

     "abstract": "Extremely interesting for aging research are those individuals able to reach older ages still with functions similar to those of younger counterparts. We examined liver samples from ad libitum-fed old (28-month-old, AL-28) and ad libitum-fed very old (32-month-old, AL-32) rats for a number of markers, relevant for mitochondrial functionality and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content. As for the mtDNA content and the protein amounts of the citrate synthase and the antioxidant peroxiredoxin III there were no significant changes in the AL-32 animals. No significant longevity-related change was found for TFAM amount, but a 50% reduction in the amount of the Lon protease, responsible for turnover of TFAM inside mitochondria, characterized the AL-32 rats. No longevity-related change was observed also for the amounts of the mtDNA repair enzymes OGG1 and APE1, whereas the intra-mitochondrial amount of the cytochrome c protein showed a 50% increase in the AL-32 rats, indicating a likely reduced initiation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Totally unexpected was the doubling of two proteins, very relevant for mitochondrial dynamics, namely MFN2 and DRP1, in the AL-32 rats. This prompted us to the calculation of all individual fusion indexes that grouped together in the AL-32 rats, while in the AL-28 animals were very different. We found a strong positive correlation between the fusion indexes and the respective mtDNA contents in two AL-28 and four AL-32 rats. This supports the idea that the limited prevalence of fusion above a still active fission should have ensured a functional mitochondrial network and should have led to a quite narrow range of high mtDNA contents, likely the best-suitable for extended longevity. Our findings strongly suggest that, among the multiple causes leading to the longevity of the AL-32 rats, the maintenance of an adult-like balance of mitochondrial dynamics seems to be very relevant for the regulation of mtDNA content and functionality.",

     "abstract": "Although balance and gait deteriorate as a person ages, it is unknown if all balance and gait measures change similarly across the adult age span. We developed the Instrumented Stand and Walk test (ISAW) to provide a quick quantification of key components of balance and walking: postural sway, anticipatory postural adjustments during step initiation, gait, and turning using body-worn, inertial sensors. Our aims were to characterize how different balance and gait measures change with age and to identify key age-related measures of mobility, in a wide age range of healthy, community-dwelling adults. A total of 135 healthy, community-dwelling subjects of age range 21\u201389\u00a0years with no history of falls were enrolled. Subjects wore inertial sensors on the wrists, ankles, sternum and lumbar area; 37 reliable and valid measures of postural sway, step initiation, gait and turning were computed. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to examine how the measures changed with age. Several distinct correlation patterns between age and ISAW measures were observed: linear deterioration, deterioration after plateau, and subtle, or no, worsening. Spatial, but not temporal, measures of gait were age-related. The strongest age correlation was found for centroidal frequency of mediolateral postural sway (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.50, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). A hierarchical regression model revealed that age was the most important predictor of mediolateral centroidal frequency, with lower sway frequencies associated with older age, independent of gender, weight, and height. Our results showed that balance and gait represent independent control systems for mobility and not all balance and gait measures deteriorate the same way with age. Postural sway during stance was more strongly related to age than any gait, gait initiation or turning measure.",

In this study, we have examined the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in mPFC interneurons and the density of the mPFC cholinergic and dopaminergic innervation in cognitively-impaired aged Wistar rats. We also tested the possibility that the potential age-related changes might rely on insufficient neurotrophic support. The total number of NPY- and VIP-immunoreactive neurons and the density of vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT)- and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive varicosities were estimated using stereological methods. The number of NPY-immunoreactive neurons was significantly reduced in aged rats, whereas the number of VIP-immunoreactive neurons was unaltered. The decreased expression of NPY was fully reversed by intracerebroventricular administration of nerve growth factor. No differences in the density of VAChT- and TH-immunoreactive varicosities were found among all groups. Our results indicate that the reduced expression of NPY in the mPFC of aged rats can be ascribed to the age-associated loss of neurotrophic support, and raise the possibility that these changes might contribute for the cognitive decline that occurs during non-pathological aging.",

Male and female outbreed CD-1 mice were studied at 3 and 12\u00a0months of age (M). Contribution of RAS was determined by treating mice from 3\u00a0M to 12\u00a0M with the AngII type 1 receptor blocker losartan (0.6\u00a0g/L in the drinking water). At 12\u00a0M, contractions to AngII were higher in males compared to females (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This effect was paralleled by a decrease in AngII type 2 receptors in 12\u00a0M males. Aging also diminished ACh relaxation in males, but did not modify female responses. Treatment of aortas with indomethacin (10\u00a0\u03bcM) restored the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in 12\u00a0M males, suggesting an increase of cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived vasoconstrictors in aged males. Chronic treatment of mice with losartan also improved endothelium-dependent relaxation. Besides, losartan significantly decreased COX-2 expression and activity in 12\u00a0M male, with a minor effect in aged females. Aging increases AngII contraction and induces endothelial dysfunction differently in males and females. In aged males, RAS contributed to increased COX-2 expression and activity, which in turn may lead to vascular dysfunction.",

Aging produced a major increase in serum IL-6 concentrations that was dramatically augmented in the Zip14 KO mice. In keeping with enhanced serum IL-6 concentrations, aging produced tissue-specific increases in zinc concentration of skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue. Metabolic endotoxemia produced by Zip14 ablation is maintained in aged KO mice. Muscle non-heme iron (NHI) was increased in aged WT mice but not in aged Zip14 KO mice demonstrating NHI uptake by muscle is ZIP14-dependent and increases with age. NF-\u03baB and STAT3 activation was greater in aged mice, but was tissue specific and inversely related to tissue zinc.

Since chronic activation of macrophages contributes to chronic low level inflammation common in older age, elucidation of the changes in middle-aged rats could be useful in prevention of unbalanced inflammatory response in advanced age. We have analysed the phenotype of unelicited and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from young and middle-aged DA and AO rats and tested functions of these cells following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Unelicited cells from middle-aged DA rats produced higher amounts of proinflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO), but have a diminished response to LPS stimulation then cells from young rats, in spite of increased frequency of TLR4- and CD14-expressing mature macrophages. Injection of thioglycollate robustly increased overall cytokine production in young rats' macrophages, while diminishing their response to LPS stimulation. In middle-aged DA rats injection of thioglycollate diminished IL-6 production, but increased it in response to LPS stimulation. Quite the contrary to DA rats, the macrophages from middle-aged AO rats have released diminished levels of TNF-\u03b1 and NO, whereas urea production was strongly increased, when compared to the macrophages from young rats. Although the thioglycollate injection has increased the proportion of CD86+\u00a0MHCII+ mature macrophages in young rats, and percentages of activated TLR4+ macrophages in both age groups of AO rats, it has not affected the cytokine production in young rats' macrophages, and the TNF-\u03b1 production in middle-aged rats' macrophages. Moreover, the injection of thioglycollate has robustly increased the production of urea in macrophages derived from both age groups of AO rats. Although middle-aged rats of both strains were healthy during experiment, differences between the inflammatory responses of peritoneal macrophages of middle-aged rats of these strains might be one of the contributing factors defining their health in their advanced age. Development of strategies for the prevention of undesirable inflammatory changes in the elderly would benefit from the prospective study of the middle-aged.",

Active smoking, obesity and low HDL-cholesterol among traditional risk factors, along with CKD, depression and low income among novel risk factors, are the strongest determinants of microinflammation. Also we found that statin therapy decreases hsCRP levels, which indicates a potential role of inflammation in CVD as a target for intervention in the elderly (e.g. statin use).",

The influence of high-fat diet-induced obesity (HF) on the anorexigenic leptin effects were also tested in younger and older middle-aged groups (HF6 and HF12).Leptin-induced anorexia varied with age: leptin suppressed re-feeding FI (following 48-h fasting) strongly in young adult (NF3), but not in younger or older middle-aged (NF6 or NF12) or in aging (NF18) rats. However, anorexigenic leptin effects reached statistical significance again in old NF24 rats. Leptin-induced hypermetabolism, on the other hand, showed monotonous age-related decline and disappeared by old age. Ob-Rb expression declined until 12\u00a0months of age followed by a partial recovery in NF18 and NF24 groups.

Age-related alterations of Ob-Rb and SOCS3 expression in the ARC may partly contribute to the explanation of age-related variations in anorexigenic but not hypermetabolic leptin effects. High-fat diet-induced obesity was associated with resistance to leptin-induced anorexia in HF6, similar to that seen in NF6. However, instead of the expected leptin-resistance in HF12, a strong leptin-induced suppression of re-feeding was detected in these obese middle-aged rats.Our results suggest that acute central effects of leptin on anorexia and hypermetabolism change in disparate ways during aging, implying separate mechanisms (e.g. signal transduction pathways) of different leptin actions. The age-related pattern shown by leptin-induced anorexia may contribute to the explanation of middle-aged obesity, and partly to that of aging anorexia. Our findings concerning obese rats are in accord with previous observations on anorexigenic effects of peripherally administered cholecystokinin: diet-induced obesity appeared to accelerate the development of age-related regulatory alterations. Similarly, our present data also raise the possibility that chronic diet-induced obesity promotes responsiveness to centrally applied leptin at least concerning anorexigenic effects.",

In humans, shift-work and jet lag perturb clock synchronization, and such perturbations, when repeated or chronic, are strongly suspected to be detrimental to healthspan. Here we investigated locomotor aging and longevity in Drosophila melanogaster with genetically or environmentally disrupted clocks. We compared two mutations in period (per, a gene essential for circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila), after introducing them in a common reference genetic background: the arrhythmic per01, and perT which displays robust short 16-h rhythms. Compared to the wild type, both per mutants showed reduced longevity and decreased startle-induced locomotion in aging flies, while spontaneous locomotor activity was not impaired. The per01 phenotypes were generally less severe than those of perT, suggesting that chronic jet lag is more detrimental to aging than arrhythmicity in Drosophila. Interestingly, the adjustment of environmental light-dark cycles to the endogenous rhythms of the perT mutant fully suppressed the acceleration in the age-related decline of startle-induced locomotion, while it accelerated this decline in wild-type flies. Overall, our results show that chronic jet lag accelerates a specific form of locomotor aging in Drosophila, and that this effect can be alleviated by environmental changes that ameliorate circadian rhythm synchronization.",

     "abstract": "Advanced paternal age is associated with increased complications in pregnancy and genetic diseases in offspring. Oxidative stress is a major contributor to the damage accumulated in sperm during aging. Complex networks of antioxidants regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the testis. While mounting evident shows that redox dysfunction compromises the quality of developing male germ cells, the mechanisms by which aging causes this remain unclear. Furthermore, therapies to successfully alleviate aging-associated loss in germ cell quality are limited. The antioxidant catalase (CAT) has been used in aging-associated pathologies to alleviate oxidative stress. We used mice overexpressing CAT (MCAT) to determine whether CAT overexpression alleviates the redox dysfunction observed with aging. We found that MCAT mice did not exhibit the age-dependent loss of spermatozoa, nor did they show aging associated loss in testicular germ and Sertoli cells seen in wild type (WT). Low overall ROS and reduced peroxynitrite levels were detected in spermatocytes from aged MCAT mice, following exposure to the pro-oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Germ cells from young MCATs showed elevated levels of DNA-damage repair markers, \u03b3-H2AX and 53BP1, but this response was lost with aging. Finally, we found oxidative stress induced 8-oxodG lesions to increase in sperm with aging; these lesions were significantly reduced in aged MCAT and these mice showed no decrease in the age-dependent number of pups per litter. Thus we conclude that aged MCAT mice generate sperm at the same rate as young mice; these sperm are protected from oxidative stress associated damage.",

The impairment in this induction has been related to aging, whereas an increased expression has been related to longevity. Nevertheless, it is still not known if the basal levels of Hsp70 can be indicative of the aging rate of different tissues. The aim of this study was to quantify the basal levels of Hsp70 in tissues from female mice throughout their aging process including long-lived mice, as well as from prematurely aging mice (PAM). Adult, old and long-lived (6, 18 and 30\u00a0months of age, respectively) female ICR-CD1 and Balb/C mice were used. Tissues with mainly mitotic (liver and renal medulla) or post-mitotic (heart, renal cortex, cerebral cortex, spleen) cells and peritoneal leukocytes from these animals as well as from adult PAM and non-prematurely aging mice (NPAM), were studied. Basal levels of Hsp70 were assessed using an ELISA method. The results showed that the aging-associated variation of the levels of Hsp70 followed a different pattern in post-mitotic and mitotic tissues, being lower or higher in old mice comparing to adults, respectively. In all the tissues analyzed the Hsp70 levels from long-lived mice were similar to those from adult animals. In addition, in adult PAM these Hsp70 levels were similar to those in chronologically old animals. In conclusion, Hsp70 basal levels show tissue-specific age-associated variations and are preserved in long-lived animals, demonstrating their role as markers of the rate of aging and longevity.",

     "abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a unicellular organism commonly used as a model to explain mechanisms of aging in multicellular organisms. It is used as a model organism for both replicative and chronological aging. Replicative aging is defined as the number of daughter cells produced by an individual cell during its life. A widely accepted hypothesis assumes that replicative aging of yeast is related to the existence of a so called \u201csenescence factor\u201d that gradually accumulates in the mother cell, which consequently leads to its death. One of the earliest proposed \u201csenescence factors\u201d were extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs). However, their role in the regulation of the replicative lifespan is somewhat controversial and subject to discussion. In this paper, we propose a more comprehensive approach to this problem by analysing the length of life and the correlation between the cell size and the replicative lifespan of yeast cells with different level of ERCs, i.e. \u0394rad52 and \u0394sgs1 mutants. This analysis shows that it is not the accumulation of ERCs but genomic instability and hypertrophy that play an important role in the regulation of reproductive potential and total lifespan of the S. cerevisiae yeast. However, these two factors have a different impact on various phases of the yeast cell life, i.e. reproductive and post-reproductive phases.",

     "abstract": "Equivocal decline of tongue muscle performance with age is compatible with resistance of the tongue to sarcopenia, the loss of muscle volume and function that typically occurs with aging. To test this possibility we characterized anatomical and molecular indices of sarcopenia in the macaque tongue muscle styloglossus (SG).We quantified myosin heavy chain (MHC), muscle fiber MHC phenotype and size and total and phosphorylated growth- and atrophy-related proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), immunoblot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the SG in twenty-four macaque monkeys (Macaca rhesus, age range 9\u00a0months to 31\u00a0years) categorized into Young (<\u00a08\u00a0years of age), Middle-aged (15\u201321\u00a0years of age) and Old (>\u00a022\u00a0years of age) groups.In Young, Middle and Old age groups, by SDS-PAGE MHCI comprised ~\u00a01/3 and MHCII ~\u00a02/3 of total MHC. MHCI relative frequency was lower and MHCII higher in Middle versus Young (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0099) and Middle versus Old (p\u00a0=\u00a00.052). Relative frequencies of MHC fiber phenotype were not different by age but were different by phenotype (rates 233, 641 and 111 per 1000 fibers for MHCI, MHCII and MHCI-II respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Few or no fibers were positive for developmental MHC. Mean cross-sectional area (CSA) was not different among the three age groups for MHCII and MHCI-II; however MHCI fibers tended to be larger in Middle versus Old and Young (mean\u00a0=\u00a02257\u00a0\u03bcm2,1917\u00a0\u03bcm2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and 1704\u00a0\u03bcm2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06), respectively). For each age group, mean CSA increased across MHC phenotype (lowest mean CSA for MHCI and highest mean CSA for MHCII). Spearman analysis demonstrated age-related increases in total p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (P70), phosphorylated P70421/424, phosphorylated P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and muscle atrophy F-Box, a trend to age-related decrease in total extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and no age-related change in total protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK46) and phosphorylated P70389.Common anatomical and molecular indices of sarcopenia are absent in our sample of macaque SG. Relative frequencies of MHCII protein and phenotype are preserved with age. Although MAFbx expression increases with age, this is not associated with fiber atrophy, perhaps reflecting compensatory growth signaling by p70. The resistant nature of the styloglossus muscle to sarcopenia may be related to routine activation of tongue muscles in respiration and swallowing and the preservation of hypoglossal motoneuron number with age.",

Emerging evidence suggests that the aging of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) contributes to the development of osteoporosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2), a stemness and senescence regulator of craniofacial BMSCs, in rat ovariectomy-induced alveolar osteoporosis. We also sought to determine whether transplantation of SATB2-modified BMSCs could ameliorate estrogen deficient alveolar bone loss. Our data revealed that BMSCs from ovariectomy-induced alveolar bone exhibited typical senescence phenotypes such as diminished stemness and osteogenic capacity, increased expression of senescence or osteoclastic markers and enhanced adipogenic potential. These phenotypic changes are a result of SATB2-mediated senescence dysregulation as evidenced by nuclear \u03b3H2AX foci formation. Moreover, overexpression of SATB2 significantly alleviated the senescence of osteoporotic BMSCs in vitro. Importantly, transplantation of SATB2-modified BMSCs significantly attenuated ovariectomy-induced alveolar bone loss in vivo. Together, our results revealed that SATB2 is a critical regulator of alveolar BMSC senescence, and its overexpression decreases these senescent changes both in vitro and in vivo. SATB2-modified BMSC delivery could be a viable and promising therapeutic strategy for alveolar bone loss induced by estrogen-deficient osteoporosis.",

The phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway plays an import role in neuronal survival and cognitive function, and is known as an upstream element of GSK3\u03b2. Fuzhisan (FZS), a Chinese herbal complex prescription, has been used for the treatment of AD for over 20\u00a0years, and is known to enhance the cognitive ability in AD patients as well as in AD model rats. However, it still remains unclear whether FZS is responsible for regulation of PI3K/AKT/GSK3\u03b2 signaling and contributes to subsequent down-regulation of A\u03b2 and phosphorylated tau. Thus, we treated APP/PS1 transgenic mice, a useful model of AD-related memory impairment, with FZS by intragastrical administration for 60\u00a0days and Donepezil was used as a positive control. The results showed that treatment with FZS significantly reversed the memory deficit in the Tg APP/PS1 mice in the Morris water maze test. Moreover, FZS significantly attenuated A\u03b2 production through inhibition of APP procession and phosphorylation of tau in the hippocampus of Tg APP/PS1 mice. In addition, FZS treatment also increased PI3K and pSer473-AKT levels, inhibited GSK3\u03b2 activity by increasing phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at Ser9. These results indicated that the memory ameliorating effect of FZS may be, in part, by regulation the PI3K/AKT/GSK3\u03b2 signaling which may contribute to down-regulation of A\u03b2 and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

We hypothesized that moderate \u2018multivitamin\u2019 supplementation could improve the vitamin status of the dependent elderly. The study took place in two nursing homes and included 144 dependent elderly (males/females, 35/109).

After a two-year daily \u2018multivitamin\u2019 supplementation, containing 120\u00a0\u03bcg of folic acid, there was a small and non-significant increase of 12% in serum folate; the same \u2018multivitamin\u2019 preparatory, containing 2.4\u00a0\u03bcg of vitamin B12, significantly increased serum vitamin B12 by 8%. Three models of evaluation clearly showed the effect of a two- year vitamin supplementation: 1. The number of subjects with the lowest baseline concentration range, decreased, with moderate concentration, increased, with no difference at the higher concentrations; 2. Above each vitamin concentration, the number of subjects was higher than at baseline; 3. The two vitamins at the two lower concentration tertiles increased, and at the highest tertile, folate was not affected, whereas vitamin B12 decreased. Therefore, very moderate \u2018multivitamin\u2019 supplementation, as practiced in our study, has a high probability of improving vulnerable old population health status without causing any adverse effects to others.",

Hence, plasma progranulin is an attractive biomarker in FTLD but poorly reflects levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggesting tissue-specific regulation of progranulin levels. Sortilin was recently identified as a progranulin scavenger receptor that destines it for lysosomal degradation. Proteolysis or alternative splicing generates soluble sortilin variants that retain progranulin binding and potentially functions as a decoy receptor. In the present study, we analyzed soluble sortilin and progranulin in plasma and CSF in 341 aging individuals. We found that soluble sortilin exists in CSF in ten-fold molar excess compared to progranulin and observed a highly significant positive correlation between soluble sortilin and progranulin levels in CSF but not in plasma. However, carriers of the minor allele of SNP rs646776 in SORT1 encoding sortilin displayed significantly increased soluble sortilin and reduced progranulin specifically in plasma but not in CSF. Taken together, our findings suggest that soluble sortilin may affect progranulin levels in both a tissue-specific and genotype-dependent manner.",

The greatest risk factor for neurodegeneration is age; thus, the antiaging effects of CR might attenuate progressive cell death and avert the aggregation of abnormal proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. CR is a potent inducer of autophagy, a tightly regulated intracellular process that facilitates recycling of abnormal protein aggregates and damaged organelles into bioenergetic and biosynthetic materials to maintain homeostasis. Thus, dysregulated autophagy can lead to cellular dysfunction, abnormal protein accumulation, proteotoxicity and subsequently the onset of several neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the targeted and precision-controlled activation of autophagy represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions that delay aging by modulating specific stages of autophagy might be beneficial against premature aging, neurodegeneration and its associated ailments. However, the dynamic and often compensatory cross-talk that exists between the protein degradation pathways makes clinical translational approaches challenging. Here we review the primary autophagy pathways in the context of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on compensatory mechanisms and pathway failure. By critically assessing each underlying molecular machinery, we reveal their impact on aging and unmask the role of caloric restriction in changing cellular fate by delayed aging through stimulation of autophagy. This may point towards novel and better targeted interventions that exploit the autophagic machinery in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

NAD+ synthase is a homodimer, which catalyzes the final step in de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis, an amide transfer from either ammonia or glutamine to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Both the CG9940 and exercise are closely relative to NAD+ level, and NAD+ plays important roles not only in energy metabolism and mitochondrial functions but also in aging. In our study, the expression of CG9940 was changed by UAS/GAL4 system in Drosophila. Flies were trained by a training device. Cardiac function was analyzed by M-mode traces, climbing index was measured through negative geotaxis assay, and lifespan was measured via lifespan assays. The important new findings from our present study included the following: (1) the expression of the CG9940 could affect cardiac function, mobility, and lifespan in Drosophila. Over-expression of the CG9940 gene had positive effects on Drosophila, such as enhanced aging cardiac output, reduced heart failure, delayed age-related mobility decline, and prolonged lifespan, but lower-expression of the CG9940 had negative effects on them. (2) Different expressions of the CG9940 resulted in different influences on the adaptation of cardiac function, mobility, and lifespan to exercise in aging Drosophila. Both normal-expression and over-expression of the CG9940 resulted in positive influences on the adaptation of cardiac functions, mobility, and lifespan to exercise in aging Drosophila such as exercise slowed age-related decline of cardiac function, mobility and extent of lifespan in these flies, while lower-expression of the CG9940 led to negative impacts on the adaptation of mobility and lifespan to exercise in Drosophila.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress can lead to premature aging symptoms and cause acute mortality at higher doses in a range of organisms. Oxidative stress resistance and longevity are mechanistically and phenotypically linked; considerable variation in oxidative stress resistance exists among and within species and typically covaries with life expectancy. However, it is unclear whether stress-resistant, long-lived individuals avoid, repair, or tolerate molecular damage to survive longer than others. The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) is an emerging model system that is well-suited to address this question. Furthermore, this species is the most economically important pollinator, whose health may be compromised by pesticide exposure, including oxidative stressors. Here, we develop a protocol for inducing oxidative stress in honey bee males (drones) via Paraquat injection. After injection, individuals from different colony sources were kept in common social conditions to monitor their survival compared to saline-injected controls. Oxidative stress was measured in susceptible and resistant individuals. Paraquat drastically reduced survival but individuals varied in their resistance to treatment within and among colony sources. Longer-lived individuals exhibited higher levels of lipid peroxidation than individuals dying early. In contrast, the level of protein carbonylation was not significantly different between the two groups. This first study of oxidative stress in male honey bees suggests that survival of an acute oxidative stressor is due to tolerance, not prevention or repair, of oxidative damage to lipids. It also demonstrates colony differences in oxidative stress resistance that might be useful for breeding stress-resistant honey bees.",

Morphometrical parameters including body and gastrocnemius weights, number and type of muscle fibers, cross section area (CSA), perimeter, and Feret's diameter of single muscle fiber, were measured. Moreover, lengths of the sarcomere, A-band, I-band, H-zone, and number and CSA of intermyofibrillar mitochondria (IFM), were also determined. The results provide evidence that 12\u00a0month-old mice had significant changes on skeletal muscle structure, beginning with the reduction of gastrocnemius weight to body weight ratio, compatible with an early loss of skeletal muscle function and strength. Moreover, light microscopy revealed increased muscle fibers size, with a significant increase on their CSA, perimeter, and diameter of both type I and type II muscle fibers, and a reduction in the percentage of muscle area occupied by type II fibers. Enhanced connective tissue infiltrations, and the presence of centrally nucleated muscle fibers, were also found in aged mice. These changes may underlie an attempt to compensate the loss of muscle mass and muscle fibers number. Furthermore, electron microscopy discovered a significant age-dependent increase in the length of sarcomeres, I and H bands, and reduction on the overlapped actin/myosin length, supporting contractile force loss with age. Electron microscopy also showed an increased number and CSA of IFM with age, which may reveal more endurance at 12\u00a0months of age. Together, mice at early stage of aging already show significant changes in gastrocnemius muscle morphology and ultrastructure that are suggestive of the onset of sarcopenia.",

Experimental evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a central role in the aging process of cochlear cells. Dietary antioxidants, in particular polyphenols, have been found to be beneficial in protecting against the generation of ROS in various diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and aging.This study was designed to investigate the effects of polyphenols on AHL and to determine whether oxidative stress plays a role in the pathophysiology of AHL.Sprague-Dawley rats (n\u00a0=\u00a0100) were divided into five groups according to their age (3, 6, 12, 18 and 24\u00a0months old) and treated with 100\u00a0mg/kg/day body weight of polyphenols dissolved in tap water for half of the life of the animal.

The myogenic potential, along with other factors that influence wound repair are known to decline with age. In order to develop effective treatment strategies for VML injuries that are effective across a broad range of patient populations, it is necessary to understand how the response to VML injury is affected by aging. Towards this end, this study was conducted to compare the response of young and aged animal groups to a lower extremity VML injury. Young (3\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a012) and aged (18\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a08) male Fischer 344 rats underwent surgical VML injury of the tibialis anterior muscle. Three months after VML injury it was found that young TA muscle was on average 16% heavier than aged muscle when no VML injury was performed and 25% heavier when comparing VML treated young and aged animals (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Peak contractile force for both the young and aged groups was found to decrease significantly following VML injury, producing 65% and 59% of the contralateral limbs' peak force, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). However, there were no differences found for peak contractile force based on age, suggesting that VML affects muscle's ability to repair, regardless of age. In this study, we used the ratio of collagen I to MyoD expression as a metric for fibrosis vs. myogenesis. Decreasing fiber cross-sectional area with advancing age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) coupled with the ratio of collagen I to MyoD expression, which increased with age, supports the thought that regeneration is impaired in the aged population in favor of fibrosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0241). This impairment is also exacerbated by the contribution of VML injury, where a 77-fold increase in the ratio of collagen I to MyoD was observed in the aged group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0002). The aged animal model described in this study provides a tool for investigators exploring not only the development of VML injury strategies but also the effect of aging on muscle regeneration.",

     "abstract": "Aging causes considerable decline in both physiological and mental functions, particularly cognitive function. The hippocampal theta rhythm (4\u201312\u00a0Hz) is related to both cognition and locomotion. Aging-related findings of the frequency and amplitude of hippocampal theta oscillations are inconsistent and occasionally contradictory. This inconsistency may be due to the effects of the sleep/wake state and different frequency subbands being overlooked. We assumed that aged rats have lower responses of the hippocampal theta rhythm during running, which is mainly due to the dominant modulation of theta frequency subbands related to cognition. By simultaneously recording electroencephalography, physical activity (PA), and the heart rate (HR), this experiment explored the theta oscillations before, during, and after treadmill running at a constant speed in 8-week-old (adult) and 60-week-old (middle-aged) rats. Compared with adult rats, the middle-aged rats exhibited lower theta activity in all frequency ranges before running. Running increased the theta frequency (Frq, 4\u201312\u00a0Hz), total activity of the whole theta band (total power, TP), activity of the middle theta frequency (MT, 6.5\u20139.5\u00a0Hz), and PA in both age groups. However, the middle-aged rats still showed fewer changes in these parameters during the whole running process. After the waking baseline values were substracted, middle-aged rats showed significantly fewer differences in \u0394Frq, \u0394TP, and \u0394MT but significantly more differences in low-frequency theta activity (4.0\u20136.5\u00a0Hz) and HR than the adult rats did. Therefore, the decreasing activity and response of the whole theta band in the middle-aged rats resulted in dominant modulation of the middle to lower frequency (4.0\u20139.5\u00a0Hz) theta rhythm. The different alterations in the theta rhythm during treadmill running in the two groups may reflect that learning decline with age.",

Thus, the muscle response to whey protein bolus ingestion with and without acute resistance exercise was compared between healthy elderly individuals and elderly individuals with slightly increased inflammation\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0NSAID treatment.Twenty-four elderly men (>\u00a060\u00a0years) were recruited.

Moreover, NSAID treatment did not significantly improve the myofibrillar and connective tissue FSR responses or reduce the plasma CRP level in inflamed, elderly individuals (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).A slight increase in systemic inflammation does not affect the basal myofibrillar FSR or the myofibrillar FSR responses, which suggests that elderly individuals with slightly increased inflammation can benefit from protein ingestion and resistance exercise to stimulate muscle protein anabolism.

In the present investigation we studied the effect of rapamycin on mitochondrial oxidative stress at the same dose that is known to increase longevity in mice (14\u00a0mg\u00a0of\u00a0rapamycin/kg of diet). Middle aged mice (16\u00a0months old) showed significant age-related increases in mitochondrial ROS production at complex I, accumulation of mtDNA fragments inside nuclear DNA, mitochondrial protein lipoxidation, and lipofuscin accumulation compared to young animals (4\u00a0months old) in the liver. After 7\u00a0weeks of dietary treatment all those increases were totally or partially (lipofuscin) abolished by rapamycin, middle aged rapamycin-treated animals showing similar levels in those parameters to young animals. The decrease in mitochondrial ROS production was due to qualitative instead of quantitative changes in complex I. The decrease in mitochondrial protein lipoxidation was not due to decreases in the amount of highly oxidizable unsaturated fatty acids. Rapamycin also decreased the amount of RAPTOR (of mTOR complex) and increased the amounts of the PGC1-\u03b1 and ATG13 proteins. The results are consistent with the possibility that rapamycin increases longevity in mice at least in part by lowering mitochondrial ROS production and increasing autophagy, decreasing the derived final forms of damage accumulated with age which are responsible for increased longevity. The decrease in lipofuscin accumulation induced by rapamycin adds to previous information suggesting that the increase in longevity induced by this drug can be due to a decrease in the rate of aging.",

     "abstract": "Werner's syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by loss of function mutation in wrn and is a useful model of premature in vivo ageing. Cellular senescence is a plausible causal mechanism of mammalian ageing and, at the cellular level, WS fibroblasts show premature senescence resulting from a combination of telomeric attrition and replication fork stalling. Over 90% of WS fibroblast cultures achieve <\u00a020 population doublings (PD) in vitro compared to wild type human fibroblast cultures.It has been proposed that some cell types, capable of proliferation, will fail to show a premature senescence phenotype in response to wrn mutations. To test this hypothesis, human dermal keratinocytes (derived from both WS and wild type patients) were cultured long term. WS Keratinocytes showed a replicative lifespan in excess of 100 population doublings but maintained functional growth arrest mechanisms based on p16 and p53. The karyotype of the cells was superficially normal and the cultures retained markers characteristic of keratinocyte holoclones (stem cells) including p63 expression and telomerase activity. Accordingly we conclude that, in contrast to WS fibroblasts, WS keratinocytes do not demonstrate slow growth rates or features of premature senescence. These findings suggest that the epidermis is among the tissue types that do not display symptoms of premature ageing caused by loss of function of wrn. This is in support that Werner's syndrome is a segmental progeroid syndrome.",

     "abstract": "Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR\u00a0+\u00a0voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24\u00a0month old 8% caloric restriction\u00a0+\u00a0wheel running (OCRWR); and 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and \u03b1-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal environment. Loss of Nox2 subunits was prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that lifelong CR and WR are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment.",

Since changes in instrumental daily living activities are one of the descriptors of behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia, we decided to investigate the neural correlates of a reduced awareness in this specific domain in twenty-three consecutive behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia patients. Gray matter volume changes associated with a reduced awareness for the instrumental domain, assessed using a validated caregiver-patient discrepancy questionnaire, were examined. Interestingly, we found disabilities in instrumental daily living activities and a reduced awareness of these to be related to medial prefrontal cortex atrophy, where the mid-cingulate cortices, dorsal anterior insula and cuneous play an important role. Importantly, if the executive system does not function correctly, the comparator mechanism of action self-monitoring does not detect mismatches between the current and previous performance states stored in the personal database, and produces a reduced awareness for the instrumental domain.",

Studies found EPO expression was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of aging rat compared with that of the youth. But mechanisms of the decline of the brain EPO during aging remain unclear. The present study utilized a d-galactose (d-gal)-induced aging model in which the inducement of aging was mainly oxidative injury, to explore underlying mechanisms for the decline of brain EPO in aging rats. d-gal-induced aging rats (2\u00a0months) were simulated by subcutaneously injecting with d-gal at doses of 50\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u2212\u00a01, 150\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u2212\u00a01 and 250\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u2212\u00a01 daily for 8\u00a0weeks while the control group received vehicle only. These groups were all compared with the aging rats (24\u00a0months) which had received no other treatment. The cognitive impairment was assessed using Morris water maze (MWM) in the prepared models, and the amount of \u03b2-galactosidase, the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) level and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the hippocampus was examined by assay kits. The levels of EPO, EPOR, p-JAK2 and hypoxia-inducible factor-2\u03b1 (HIF-2\u03b1) in the hippocampus were detected by western blot. Additionally, the correlation coefficient between EPO/EPOR expression and MDA level was analyzed. The MWM test showed that compared to control group, the escape latency was significantly extended and the times of crossing the platform was decreased at the doses of 150\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u2212\u00a01 and 250\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u2212\u00a01 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Also, the amount of \u03b2-galactosidase and the MDA level in the hippocampus were significantly increased but the SOD activity was significantly decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, 0.01 and 0.01, respectively). Similar to aging rats, the expressions of EPO, EPOR, p-JAK2, and HIF-2\u03b1in the brain of d-gal-treated rats were significantly decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at 150\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u2212\u00a01 and 250\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u2212\u00a01. Interestingly, negative correlations were found between EPOR (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.699, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), EPO (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.701, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and the MDA level. These results indicated that aging could result in the decline of EPO in the hippocampus and oxidative stress might be the main reason for the decline of brain EPO in aging rats, involved with the decrease of HIF-2\u03b1 stability.",

Transmission of the mitochondrial genome in the matrilineal line causes the evolutionary selection sieve only in females. Theoretically, beneficial or neutral variations are more likely to accumulate and be retained in the female mitochondrial genome during evolution, which may be an initial trigger of gender dimorphism in aging. The asymmetry of evolutionary processes between gender could lead to males and females aging in different ways. If so, gender specific variation loads could be an evolutionary result of maternal heritage of mitochondrial genomes, especially in centenarians who live to an extreme age and are considered as good models for healthy aging. Here, we tested whether the mitochondrial variation loads were associated with altered aging patterns by investigating the mtDNA haplogroup distribution and genetic diversity between female and male centenarians. We found no evidence of differences in aging patterns between genders in centenarians. Our results indicate that the evolutionary consequence of gender dimorphism in mitochondrial genomes is not a factor in the altered aging patterns in human, and that mitochondrial DNA contributes equally to longevity in males and females.",

MiR-92a is important in developmental vascular growth and tumorigenesis and two of its putative targets, tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) and collagen type 1, play a role in age-related arterial dysfunction. We hypothesized that reduced miR-92a expression contributes to age-related arterial dysfunction characterized by endothelial dysfunction and increased large artery stiffness. MiR-92a is reduced 39% (RT-PCR, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in arteries of older adults compared to young adults. Similarly, there was a 40% reduction in miR-92a in aortas of old (29\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a013) compared to young (6\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a011) B6D2F1 mice, an established model of vascular aging. To determine if reduced miR-92a contributes to arterial dysfunction; miR-92a was inhibited in vivo in young mice using antagomirs (I.P., 4\u00a0wks). Antagomir treatment was associated with a concomitant 48% increase in TNFR1 (Western blot, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), 19% increase in type 1 collagen (immunohistochemistry, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and a reduction in endothelial dependent dilation (max dilation: 93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 vs. 73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in response to acetylcholine (ACh, 10\u2212\u00a09 to 10\u2212\u00a04\u00a0M). Treatment with the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10\u2212\u00a04\u00a0M), revealed that impaired ACh dilation after antagomir treatment resulted from reduced NO bioavailability. Inhibition of miR-92a also increased arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, 309\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 vs. 484\u00a0\u00b1\u00a052\u00a0cm/s, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Together, these results suggest that experimental reductions in arterial miR-92a partially mimic the arterial aging phenotype and we speculate that modulating miR-92a may provide a therapeutic strategy to improve age-related arterial dysfunction.",

Heart rate response to pain was less pronounced in AD but not significant (g\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.746, p\u00a0=\u00a00.11). People with AD (n\u00a0=\u00a090) had significantly higher FACS scores versus HCs (n\u00a0=\u00a0109) (g\u00a0=\u00a00.442, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) indicating increased pain. Meta-regression demonstrated that an increasing percentage of AD female participants moderated pain threshold (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) whilst MMSE scores did not (p\u00a0=\u00a00.19).People with AD have a greater sensitivity to pain when validated observer ratings of facial expressions are used. Verbal response to painful stimuli, even under experimental conditions, may mean pain is not identified in people with AD. Clinically useful observer rated pain tools may be the most appropriate way to assess pain in AD.",

     "abstract": "Cellular senescence is historically associated with cancer suppression and aging. Recently, the reach of the senescence genetic program has been extended to include the ability of senescent cells to actively participate in tissue remodelling during many physiological processes, including placental biology, embryonic patterning, wound healing, and tissue stress responses caused by cancer therapy. Besides growth arrest, a significant feature of senescent cells is their ability to modify their immediate microenvironment using a senescence-associated (SA) secretome, commonly termed the SA secretory phenotype (SASP). Among others, the SASP contains growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular proteases that modulate the majority of both the beneficial and detrimental microenvironmental phenotypes caused by senescent cells. The SASP is thus becoming an obvious pharmaceutical target to manipulate SA effects. Herein, we review known signalling pathways underlying the SASP, including the DNA damage response (DDR), stress kinases, inflammasome, alarmin, inflammation- and cell survival-related transcription factors, miRNAs, RNA stability, autophagy, chromatin components, and metabolic regulators. We also describe the SASP as a temporally regulated dynamic sub-program of senescence that can be divided into a rapid DDR-associated phase, an early self-amplification phase, and a late \u201cmature\u201d phase, the late phase currently being the most widely studied SASP signature. Finally, we discuss how deciphering the signalling pathways regulating the SASP reveal targets that can be manipulated to harness the SA effects to benefit therapies for cancer and other age-related pathologies.",

The main psychological explanations for this so-called \u201cpositivity effect\u201d in memory principally rely on emotional, motivational, and cognitive mechanisms that make older adults' cognition highly sensitive to positive information according to ultimate goals of well-being. However, emerging evidence also delineates a genetic profile for positivity effects in memory, which may render some older adults more prone than others to encoding and remembering positive memories. First, we present a brief overview of behavioral and neuroimaging studies about the positivity effect in aging. Subsequently, we report studies on candidate genes associated with positive memories. In particular, we review work to date on several candidate genes that are sensitive to stimulus valence such as ADRA2B, COMT, and 5HTTLPR. Finally, we propose that the future approach to the study of genetic correlates of positivity effects in memory should also include mitochondrial functioning (TOMM40). Altogether, the study of genetics and cell biology of positivity effects in memory can help us to reveal the underlying bottom-up pathways to positive affect in healthy aging.",

The levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF), the pAkt/Akt ratio (also known as protein kinase B) and NeuN (neuronal nuclei), a neuron marker, were decreased in the hypothalamus of old rats. Old rats that received a (PhSe)2-supplemented diet and performed swimming exercise had the hypothalamic levels of Iba-1 and GFAP decreased. The combined treatment also increased the levels of Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 and decreased the ratios of cleaved PARP/full length PARP and pJNK/JNK in old rats. The levels of mBDNF and NeuN, but not the pAkt/Akt ratio, were increased by combined treatment.

It is promising to develop effective treatments for PD through modulation of aging-related molecules. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a strong deacetylase highly expressed in the brain, has been implicated in the aging process. In our present study, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 12\u00a0mg/kg once daily) was observed to bring about significant behavioral deficits and striatal dopamine depletion in aging male and female mice, while it did not do so in young animals. MPTP did not cause significant reduction in striatal 5-hydroxytryptamine content in aging male and female mice. Furthermore, we observed that MPTP treatment resulted in significant reduction in GSH content and significant increase in MDA content and SIRT2 expression in the substantia nigra (SN) of aging mice, while it did not do so in young animals. Importantly, we observed that AK-7 (a selective SIRT2 inhibitor) significantly improved behavior abnormality and neurochemical deficits in aging male and female mice treated with MPTP. Significant increase in GSH content and significant decrease in MDA content were also observed in the SN of aging male and female mice co-treated with MPTP and AK-7 compared with the MPTP-treated animals. Our results indicated that MPTP induce aging-related neurochemical and behavioural deficits and dysfunction of redox network in male and female mice and AK-7 may be neuroprotective in PD through modulating redox network.",

     "abstract": "Adult ageing results in a progressive loss of vestibular hair cell receptors and afferent fibres. Given the robustness of vestibulo-ocular and vestibular-evoked whole-body responses to age-related deterioration, it was proposed that the vestibular system compensates centrally. Here we examine the potential for central compensation in vestibular sensitivity with adult ageing by using a combination of real and virtual rotation-based psychophysical testing at two stimulus frequencies (0.1 & 1\u00a0Hz). Real rotations activate semi-circular canal hair cell receptors naturally via mechanotransduction, while electrical current used to evoke virtual rotations does not rely on mechanical deformation of hair cell receptors to activate vestibular afferents. This two-pronged approach allows us to determine the independent effects of age-related peripheral afferent receptor loss and potential compensatory mechanisms. Older adults had thresholds for discriminating real rotations that were significantly greater than young adults at 0.1\u00a0Hz (7.2 vs. 3\u00b0/s), but the effect of age was weaker (non-significant) at 1\u00a0Hz (2.4 vs. 1.3\u00b0/s). For virtual rotations, older adults had greater thresholds than young adults at 0.1\u00a0Hz (1.2 vs. 0.5\u00a0mA), however, older adults outperformed young adults at 1\u00a0Hz (0.6 vs. 1.1\u00a0mA). Based on these thresholds, we argue that central vestibular processing gain is enhanced in older adults for 1\u00a0Hz real and virtual rotations, partially offsetting the negative impact of normal age-related hair cell receptor and primary afferent loss. We propose that the frequency dependence of this compensation reflects the physiological importance of the 1\u20135\u00a0Hz range in natural vestibular input.",

To this end, changes in neuromuscular parameters were compared between two groups (matched for age, sex and initial maximal strength) that trained twice a week for 24\u00a0weeks, with one group receiving a protein supplementation enriched with leucine (supplementation group, n\u00a0=\u00a012), and another group receiving a placebo (control group, n\u00a0=\u00a013) that provided subjects with a similar energy intake that the protein supplementation. Muscle thickness and pennation angle of gastrocnemius medialis were used as indices of muscle hypertrophy. Maximal strength and associated electromyographic activity of leg muscles, and voluntary activation (assessed by the interpolated twitch technique) were recorded. Peak torque in response to 3-pulse train delivered to the tibial nerve was also recorded. After training, muscle thickness (+\u00a08.4%) and pennation angle (+\u00a013.4%) were increased, regardless of training groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Maximal plantar flexion strength (+\u00a028.2%) and voluntary activation (+\u00a029.5%) increased to the same extent for both training groups. Peak torque evoked by 3-pulse train increased similarly between training groups (+\u00a013.4%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Regardless of protein supplementation, results obtained in twelve subjects indicate that muscle hypertrophy mainly occurred in the last 12\u00a0weeks of the programme.

     "abstract": "We develop a theoretical model from an energetic viewpoint for unraveling the entangled effects of metabolic and biosynthetic rates on oxidative cellular damage accumulation during animal's growth, and test the model by experiments in hornworms. The theoretical consideration suggests that most of the cellular damages caused by the oxidative metabolism can be repaired by the efficient maintenance mechanisms, if the energy required by repair is unlimited. However, during growth a considerable amount of energy is allocated to the biosynthesis, which entails tradeoffs with the requirements of repair. Thus, the model predicts that cellular damage is more influenced by the biosynthetic rate than the metabolic rate. To test the prediction, we induced broad variations in metabolic and biosynthetic rates in hornworms, and assayed the lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl. We found that the increase in the cellular damage was mainly caused by the increase in biosynthetic rate, and the variations in metabolic rate had negligible effect. The oxidative stress hypothesis of aging suggests that high metabolism leads to high cellular damage and short lifespan. However, some empirical studies showed that varying biosynthetic rate, rather than metabolic rate, changes animal's lifespan. The conflicts between the empirical evidence and the hypothesis are reconciled by this study.",

     "abstract": "Obesity and its complications constitute a major health problem in postmenopausal women. The identification of the obesity phenotype, especially that of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) patients, is a necessary part of obesity treatment protocols. There are several methods to define MHO, but unfortunately, all of them are arbitrary and inconsistent. The aim of this work was to determine whether lipid accumulation product (LAP) could be used as a marker of the MHO phenotype in postmenopausal women. A sample of 345 Polish postmenopausal women aged 50\u201360\u00a0years old participated in the study. Participants were classified as obese when their BMI was >\u00a027. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to estimate the best cutoff for the LAP index value to identify postmenopausal women without metabolic syndrome components. We found that the best cutoff value was LAP \u2264\u00a029.9, and this value was used to define MHO individuals. With this definition, the identification of MHO individuals could be made when both of the following criteria were met: LAP index \u2264\u00a029.9 and no arterial hypertension (SBP\u00a0<\u00a0130\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg, DBP\u00a0<\u00a085\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg). The anthropometric and body fat distribution measurements, as well as the metabolic characteristics of MHO women identified according to the above definition, were compared with those of MHO women identified by two other methods in the literature. These methods and our definition identified similar proportions of MHO women ranging from 11.6% to 16.9%. We found that MHO women identified by all of the definitions used in this study possessed a similar metabolic status, and they did not differ in anthropometric indices or body fat distribution measurements. We concluded that the combination of LAP estimation and arterial blood pressure measurement appear to constitute a useful method for identifying the MHO phenotype in postmenopausal women.",

We employed two-sample genetic IV analyses, constructing a polygenic risk score (PRS) of TL-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. The first approach examined the association of the PRS with nine individual health outcomes in HRS. The second approach took advantage of estimates available in GWAS databases to estimate the impact of TL on five health outcomes using an inverse variance-weighted meta-analytic technique.Using individual-level data, shorter TL was marginally statistically significantly associated with decreased risk of stroke and increased risk of heart disease. Using the meta-analytic approach, shorter TL was associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease (OR 1.02 per 100 base pairs, 95%CI: 1.00, 1.03).With the exception of a small contribution to heart disease, our findings suggest that TL may be a marker of disease rather than a cause.

Purple sweet potato is rich in antioxidant anthocyanin. The purpose of the present study was to examine if supplementation of purple sweet potato anthocyanin (PSPA) could reduce the mortality of fruit flies fed a high-fat diet. Results showed that the mean lifespan of fruit flies was shortened from 56 to 35\u00a0days in a dose-dependent manner when lard in the diet increased from 0% to 20%. PSPA supplementation partially attenuated the lard-induced mortality. The maximum lifespan and 50% survival time were 49 and 27\u00a0days, respectively, for the 10% lard control flies, in contrast, these parameters increased to 57 and 30\u00a0days in the PSPA-supplemented fruit flies. Similarly, addition of lard into diet increased the total body LPO, while addition of PSPA partially attenuated its increase. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that PSPA-supplemented diet significantly up-regulated the mRNA of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and Rpn11, compared with the control lard diet. The western blot analysis also demonstrated that PSPA supplementation was associated with up-regulation protein mass of SOD1, SOD2, and CAT. In addition, PSPA supplementation could restore the climbing ability of fruit flies fed a 10% lard diet. We could conclude that the lifespan-prolonging activity of PSPA was potentially mediated by modulating the genes of SOD, CAT and Rpn11.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and safety of non-weight-bearing all-extremity HIIT in older adults. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that all-extremity HIIT will be more effective in improving aerobic fitness, cardiac function, and metabolic risk factors compared with all-extremity MICT. Fifty-one healthy sedentary older adults (age: 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years) were randomized to HIIT (n\u00a0=\u00a017), MICT (n\u00a0=\u00a018) or non-exercise control (CONT; n\u00a0=\u00a016). HIIT (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0min 90% of peak heart rate; HRpeak) and isocaloric MICT (70% of HRpeak) were performed on a non-weight-bearing all-extremity ergometer, 4\u00a0\u00d7/week for 8\u00a0weeks under supervision. All-extremity HIIT was feasible in older adults and resulted in no adverse events. Aerobic fitness (peak oxygen consumption; VO2peak) and ejection fraction (echocardiography) improved by 11% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and 4% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), respectively in HIIT, while no changes were observed in MICT and CONT (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.1). Greater improvements in ejection fraction were associated with greater improvements in VO2peak (r\u00a0=\u00a00.57; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment) decreased only in HIIT by 26% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016). Diastolic function, body composition, glucose and lipids were unaffected (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.1). In conclusion, all-extremity HIIT is feasible and safe in older adults. HIIT, but not MICT, improved aerobic fitness, ejection fraction, and insulin resistance.",

We, therefore investigated the antioxidant potential of melatonin (Mel) on hyperthyroidism-induced oxidative stress and neuronal cell death in the hippocampus region of brain (cognition and memory centre) of aged female golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus. Aged female hamsters were randomly divided into four experimental groups (n\u00a0=\u00a07); group-I: control, group-II: Melatonin (5\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01\u00a0day\u2212\u00a01, i.p., for one week), group-III: Hyperthyroid (100\u00a0\u03bcg kg\u2212\u00a01\u00a0day\u2212\u00a01, i.p., for two weeks) and group-IV- Hyper\u00a0+\u00a0Mel. Hormonal profiles (thyroid and melatonin), activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPX), lipid peroxidation level (TBARS) and the specific apoptotic markers (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Caspase-3) expression were evaluated. A significant increase in the profile of total thyroid hormone (tT3 and tT4) in hyperthyroidic group as compared to control while tT3 significantly decreased in melatonin treated hyperthyroidic group. However, Mel level significantly decreased in hyperthyroidic group but increased in melatonin treated hyperthyroidic group. Further, the number of immune-positive cells for thyroid hormone receptor-alpha (TR-\u03b1) decreased in the hippocampus of hyperthyroidic group and increased in melatonin treated hyperthyroidic group. Profiles of antioxidant enzymes showed a significant decrease in hyperthyroidic group with a simultaneous increase in lipid peroxidation (TBARS). Melatonin treatment to hyperthyroidic group lead to decreased TBARS level with a concomitant increase in antioxidant enzyme activity. Moreover, increased expression of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Caspase-3, in hyperthyroidic group had elevated neuronal cell death in hippocampal area and melatonin treatment reduced its expression in hyperthyroidic group. Our findings thus indicate that melatonin reduced the hyperthyroidism-induced oxidative stress and neuronal cell death in the hippocampus region of brain, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach of melatonin for management of cognition and memory function in females under hyperthyroid condition.",

     "abstract": "The majority of the strength training studies in older adults have incorporated fixed-form exercises using seated resistance training machines. In light of the modest improvements in physical function shown in these studies, functional or task-specific exercises, involving movement patterns that mimic daily activities, have been studied. Free-form exercises, using free-weights or cable, is another form of functional strength training. Currently, no intervention studies exist comparing free-form exercises, using cable machines, and fixed-form exercises, using seated machines in older adults.A total of 29 independently-living older adults, 65\u00a0years or older, were randomized into two groups, seated machine (SM, n\u00a0=\u00a010) and standing cable (SC, n\u00a0=\u00a012). After 12\u00a0weeks of training twice per week, groups were compared. The primary outcome was the Physical Performance Battery (PPB), a measure of physical function. Secondary outcomes were lower and upper body strength and power, activities of daily living evaluated by multiple tests including: Physical Performance Test (PPT), pan carry and gallon jug transfers, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and self-reported function using Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Outcome assessors were blinded to participants' intervention assignments.The PPB (SC\u00a0=\u00a00.23 points; SM\u00a0=\u00a00.15 points) showed clinical and significant improvements, but there was no significant difference between the groups (g\u00a0=\u00a00.2, 95% CI (\u2212\u00a00.6, 1.0). For secondary outcomes, chair stand (g\u00a0=\u00a00.7, 95% CI (0.2, 1.6), p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and pan carry (g\u00a0=\u00a00.8, 95% CI (0.07, 1.07), p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) favored SC, while chest press 1RM ( g =\u00a00.2, 95% CI (0.06, 1.1), p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) favored SM. There were no statistically significant group differences between PPB, gallon jug transfer, leg press 1RM, power, RPE or self-reported function.Standing cable training was not superior to seated machine training in improving physical performance in older adults. However, both training interventions were effective in improving function. The findings also suggest that exercise specificity should be considered when prescribing resistance exercises to improve physical function in older adults.",

To evaluate benefits of PSC for health and longevity, antioxidant activity and anti-aging effects were studied in vitro and in a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model system. PSC exhibited antioxidant activity in vitro, and induced beneficial effects on lifespan and several health parameters of C.elegans, including pharyngeal pumping rate, locomotion and lipofuscin accumulation. In a mev-1 mutant, PSC increased lifespan, and it enhanced oxidative stress tolerance in wild-type nematodes. After treatment with PSC, SOD activity, GSH content, and GSH/GSSG ratio were increased, leading to low intracellular ROS levels in C. elegans. PSC up-regulated skn-1 mRNA, and its target gene gcs-1, and abolished the extension of lifespan in skn-1 mutant, indicating that PSC-mediated longevity is dependent on activation of the skn-1/Nrf-2 transcription factor. Current results warrant research into the use of PSC as nutraceuticals for overall health improvement.",

We have observed that p49/STRAP alters the intracellular NAD/NADH ratio and induces protein deacetylation. Here we report that p49/STRAP overexpression caused the deacetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 (H4K16) and suppressed the expression of PGC-1\u03b1 as well as mitofusin-1 and mitofusin-2 at both the mRNA and protein levels. P49/STRAP also reduced mitochondrial size, mitochondrial membrane potential and the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. We noted that P49/STRAP expression was increased in the old versus young adult mouse hearts and also increased with advancing population doubling levels in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). It is therefore very plausible that increased expression of p49/STRAP in late life may alter the status of histone acetylation and impact mitochondrial dynamics and thereby reduce mitochondrial function and cardiac performance during mammalian senescence.",

As an alternative approach, one could first try to identify biomarkers of healthy ageing and the genetic variants associated with these traits and subsequently determine the association of these variants with human longevity. In the present study, we used this approach by testing whether the 35 baseline serum parameters measured in the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) meet the proposed criteria for a biomarker of healthy ageing.The LLS consists of 421 families with long-lived siblings of European descent, who were recruited together with their offspring and the spouses of the offspring (controls). To test the four criteria for a biomarker of healthy ageing in the LLS, we determined the association of the serum parameters with chronological age, familial longevity, general practitioner-reported general health, and mortality.Out of the 35 serum parameters, we identified glucose, insulin, and triglycerides as biomarkers of healthy ageing, meeting all four criteria in the LLS. We subsequently showed that the genetic variants previously associated with these parameters are significantly enriched in the largest genome-wide association study for human longevity.In conclusion, we showed that biomarkers of healthy ageing can be used to leverage genetic studies into human longevity. We identified several genetic variants influencing the variation in glucose, insulin and triglycerides that contribute to human longevity.",

Physical activity was measured objectively using the Actigraph accelerometer (LIFE) and SenseWear Pro armband (SEA). Phosphocreatine recovery following muscle contraction of the quadriceps was measured using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ATPmax (mM ATP/s) was calculated. Walking performance was defined as time (s) to walk 400\u00a0m at a usual-pace. The cross-sectional association between mitochondrial function and walking performance was assessed using multivariable linear regression.Participants were 77.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0years, 64.2% female and 67.2% white.

     "abstract": "Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by multi system dysregulation. It has been suggested that chronic inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of frailty. No study so far has identified accurate, specific and sensitive molecular biomarkers for frailty. High-temperature requirement serine protease A1 (HtrA1) is a secreted multidomain serine protease implicated in the inhibition of signaling of active transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)1, a cytokine which has an important anti-inflammation role. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of circulating levels of HtrA1 with frailty in a sample of older adults.The study was performed in 120 older adults aged >\u00a065\u00a0years and admitted to a geriatric outpatient clinic. The frailty status of participants was assessed by both the Fried's criteria (physical frailty, PF) and a modified Rockwood's frailty index (FI). Plasma HtrA1 concentration was measured using commercial ELISA kit. Frailty was identified in 61/120 participants (50.8%) using PF, and in 60/118 subjects (50.8%) using FI. Plasma levels of HtrA1 were significantly higher in individuals classified as frail according to PF (75.9\u00a0ng/mL, 95% CI 67.4\u201385.6) as compared with non-frail participants (48.4\u00a0ng/mL, 95% CI 42.5\u201354.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

The age- related loss of muscle mass and strength is associated with adverse outcomes of physical disability, frailty and death. \u03b2-Hydroxy \u03b2-Methyl Butyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, has beneficial effects on muscle mass and strength under various catabolic conditions. The objectives of the present study were to determine if age- related differences existed in endogenous plasma HMB levels, and to assess if HMB levels correlated to total appendicular lean mass and forearm grip strength. Anthropometry, dietary and physical activity assessment, and the estimation of fasting plasma HMB concentrations and handgrip strength were performed on the 305 subjects (children, young adults and older adults). Lean mass, which serves as a surrogate for muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Mean plasma HMB concentrations were significantly lower with increasing age groups, with children having highest mean HMB concentration (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) followed by young adults and older adults. Female subjects (across all ages) had significantly lower plasma HMB concentrations. A significant positive correlation between HMB concentrations and appendicular lean mass normalized for body weight (%), appendicular lean mass (r\u00a0=\u00a00.37; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) was observed in the young adults and older adults group.

The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of the neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and locus coeruleus (LC), to analyze their role in determining reproductive senescence. Adult female Wistar rats in the diestrus phase (4\u00a0months/cyclic) and old females (18\u201320\u00a0months/acyclic) in persistent diestrus, were decapitated or perfused at three different time intervals (10, 14 and 18\u00a0h) throughout the day. In acyclic rats, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and noradrenaline (NE) content were reduced; Fos-related antigen (FRA) in AVPV and Fos-related antigen/Tyrosine hydroxylase (FRA/TH) in LC showed immunolabeling of a higher number of neurons in these animals. The 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol/noradrenaline (MHPG/NE) ratio was higher and plasma LH was lower in the acyclic rats. Furthermore, the estradiol level was higher, and the progesterone level was lower after 14\u00a0h of persistent diestrus. These findings suggested that during the periestropause, there was a higher level of POA/AVPV and NE neuronal activity in the LC of acyclic rats, associated with a lower capacity of synthesis and storage of neurotransmitters and neurohormones contributed to changes in the temporal pattern of neuroendocrine signaling, thereby compromising the accuracy of inhibitory and stimulatory effects, causing irregularity in the estrous cycle and determining reproductive senescence",

Twenty-four healthy and independent living older adults (9 men, 15 women) with a mean age of 79.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8\u00a0years participated. Based on gait speed, handgrip strength and muscle mass all subjects were categorized into one of the three conceptual sarcopenia stages (pre-sarcopenia, sarcopenia, severe sarcopenia). Maximal strength of dorsiflexors in the left leg was measured and voluntary activation was assessed by the interpolated twitch technique. In addition, isometric evoked contractile properties were recorded. Skeletal muscle mass was assessed by ultrasound from nine sites. There were roughly equal number of subjects in each sarcopenic category, and age was not different among the 3 groups. There were no differences in handgrip strength and skeletal muscle mass index among the 3 groups. Gait speed was significantly slower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the severe sarcopenic subjects compared to the pre-sarcopenic group. With no differences in voluntary activation among the groups, the maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) for severe sarcopenic subjects were 29% lower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and with 19% slower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) voluntary rates of torque development (RTD) compared to sarcopenic subjects. Furthermore, the severe group was 34% lower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) with 36% slower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) RTD compared to pre-sarcopenic subjects. Peak twitch tension was 54% lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the severe group compared with the pre-sarcopenic group. Maximal twitch RTD were 40% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) slower for the severe group compared to the sarcopenia group, and 51% slower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) compared with the pre-sarcopenia group, but when normalized to peak torques there were no statistical differences. The laboratory tests found neuromuscular differences among the 3 groups which generally supported the classification scheme and helped to illustrate some key factors that could explain differences in functional capacities. These initial findings support the assumption that this categorization is relevant for identifying older adults with different neuromuscular properties. However, further studies are needed to provide more insight into the specific neuromuscular changes in the three sarcopenia stages, and how these changes relate to functional capacity. Such studies could ultimately contribute to identifying optimal interventions to improve neuromuscular functioning.",

     "abstract": "The kidney ages quickly compared with other organs. Expression of senescence markers reflects changes in the energy metabolism in the kidney. Two important issues in aging are mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) is a member of the ligand-activated nuclear receptor superfamily. PPAR\u03b1 plays a major role as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in various processes. In this study, 18-month-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups, the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a07) and the fenofibrate-treated group (n\u00a0=\u00a07) was fed the normal chow plus fenofibrate for 6\u00a0months. The PPAR\u03b1 agonist, fenofibrate, improved renal function, proteinuria, histological change (glomerulosclerosis and tubular interstitial fibrosis), inflammation, and apoptosis in aging mice. This protective effect against age-related renal injury occurred through the activation of AMPK and SIRT1 signaling. The activation of AMPK and SIRT1 allowed for the concurrent deacetylation and phosphorylation of their target molecules and decreased the kidney's susceptibility to age-related changes. Activation of the AMPK-FOXO3a and AMPK-PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathways ameliorated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results suggest that activation of PPAR\u03b1 and AMPK-SIRT1 signaling may have protective effects against age-related renal injury. Pharmacological targeting of PPAR\u03b1 and AMPK-SIRT1 signaling molecules may prevent or attenuate age-related pathological changes in the kidney.",

The BsmI polymorphism showed allelic frequencies in the SUF group of B 49% and b 51% and in the INSUF/DEF group B 38% and b 62%. The frequency of bb homozygosity was significantly associated with lower serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations compared to Bb, both in the general population and in the SUF group.

We found that the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and coenzyme Q (CoQ) content were reduced in aged (15-month-old) male mice compared to those in young (6-month-old) male mice. Concomitantly, motor functions, including the rate of movement and exploratory and voluntary motor activities, were significantly reduced in the aged mice compared to the young mice. In the motor cortex of the aged mouse brain, the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) phosphorylated at serine129 (Ser129) significantly increased, and the level of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) decreased compared with that in the young mouse brain. The administration of exogenous water-soluble CoQ10 to aged mice via drinking water restored the mitochondrial OCR, motor function, and phosphorylated \u03b1-syn and VGluT1 levels in the motor cortex.

     "abstract": "Self-report questionnaires are widely used to assess physical function in older adults. However, they often lack a clear frame of reference and hence interpreting and rating task difficulty levels can be problematic for the responder. Consequently, the usefulness of traditional self-report questionnaires for assessing higher-level functioning is limited. Video-based questionnaires can overcome some of these limitations by offering a clear and objective visual reference for the performance level against which the subject is to compare his or her perceived capacity. Hence the purpose of the study was to develop and validate a novel, video-based questionnaire to assess physical function in older adults independently living in the community.A total of 61 community-living adults, 60\u00a0years or older, were recruited. To examine validity, 35 of the subjects completed the video questionnaire, two types of physical performance tests: a test of instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) included in the Short Physical Functional Performance battery (PFP-10), and a composite of 3 performance tests (30\u00a0s chair stand, single-leg balance and usual gait speed). To ascertain reliability, two-week test-retest reliability was assessed in the remaining 26 subjects who did not participate in validity testing.The video questionnaire showed a moderate correlation with the IADLs (Spearman rho\u00a0=\u00a00.64, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; 95% CI (0.4, 0.8)), and a lower correlation with the composite score of physical performance tests (Spearman rho\u00a0=\u00a00.49, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; 95% CI (0.18, 0.7)). The test-retest assessment yielded an intra-class correlation (ICC) of 0.87 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; 95% CI (0.70, 0.94)) and a Cronbach's alpha of 0.89 demonstrating good reliability and internal consistency.Our results show that the video questionnaire developed to evaluate physical function in community-living older adults is a valid and reliable assessment tool; however, further validation is needed for definitive conclusions.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetics (particularly DNA methylation) together with environmental and genetic factors, are key to understanding the pathogenesis of many diseases including dementia. Disturbances in DNA methylation have already been implicated in dementia. Homocysteine metabolism, with folate and vitamin B12 as essential cofactors, is integral to methylation processes.We evaluated in a case-control study the association of global DNA methylation, homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 status with dementia. Selected polymorphisms of genes previously associated with dementia development and the influence of various factors on DNA methylation were also investigated.102 patients with dementia (53 with Alzheimer's disease, 17 with vascular dementia and 32 with mixed dementia) were recruited. The non-demented controls consisted of 45 age-matched subjects without dementia and 47 individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Global DNA methylation was determined by Imprint Methylated DNA Quantification Kit MDQ1 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK). Plasma homocysteine, serum folate and vitamin B12 were determined by chemiluminescence. Plasma and erythrocyte 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and plasma methylmalonic acid (markers of folate and vitamin B12 status) were measured by HPLC. APOE, PON1 p.Q192R, MTHFR 677C\u00a0>\u00a0T (c.665C\u00a0>\u00a0T) and IL1B-511C\u00a0>\u00a0T polymorphisms were identified using PCR-RFLP methods.Patients with dementia had significantly higher concentrations of homocysteine (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) and methylmalonic acid (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) and lower folate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and plasma 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) than non-demented subjects. There was no difference in DNA methylation between patients and controls. A non-significant tendency to higher DNA methylation in patients with vascular dementia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.061) was observed. Multivariate regression analysis of all recruited individuals demonstrated a significant positive association between DNA methylation and folate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013), creatinine (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) concentrations and IL1B-511\u00a0T (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and PON1 192R (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) alleles and negative association with fasting glucose (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004).The biochemical results showed significantly lower folate and vitamin B12 status in demented patients than controls. Global DNA methylation was associated with markers of folate status, creatinine, glucose and PON1 and IL1B polymorphisms.",

     "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that the Ginkgo biloba extract EGb761 may help to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanism of its action remains to be elaborated. In this study, we examined the effects of EGb761 using the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. Two-month-old APP/PS1 mice were supplemented with EGb761 daily for 6\u00a0months. We found that this chronic treatment with EGb761 improved the cognitive function of these mice and also significantly alleviated amyloid plaque deposition. Although the level of insoluble amyloid beta (A\u03b2) was decreased, the soluble content of A\u03b2 was not changed after administration of EGb761. We then determined the changes in central inflammation and observed that the activated microglia around amyloid plaque was increased in these treated mice. We also found that chronic EGb761 treatment downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines and Arginase-1 (Arg-1), suggesting that EGb761 regulated the phenotype of activated microglia in the APP/PS1 mouse brain. In support of this, pretreatment of the BV2 microglial cell line with EGb761 inhibited the inflammatory reaction to A\u03b2. Furthermore, the addition of conditioned media derived from BV2 cells that were co-treated with A\u03b2 and EGb761, protected neurons against treatment of A\u03b2 and inhibited apoptotic damage. Taken together, our results demonstrated that EGb761 provided a protective effect in APP/PS1 mouse. This protection was correlated with an inhibition of the pro-inflammatory effects of microglia and an induction of anti-inflammatory effects. These results strongly suggest that EGb761 provides a protective effect in APP/PS1 mouse via regulation of inflammation in the brain.",

     "abstract": "Approximately 800 thousand patients require mechanical ventilation in the United States annually with an in-hospital mortality rate of over 30%. The majority of patients requiring mechanical ventilation are over the age of 65 and advanced age is known to increase the severity of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and in-hospital mortality rates. However, the mechanisms which predispose aging ventilator patients to increased mortality rates are not fully understood. Ventilation with conservative fluid management decreases mortality rates in acute respiratory distress patients, but to date there has been no investigation of the effect of conservative fluid management on VILI and ventilator associated mortality rates. We hypothesized that age-associated increases in susceptibility and incidence of pulmonary edema strongly promote age-related increases in ventilator associated mortality.2\u00a0month old and 20\u00a0month old male C57BL6 mice were mechanically ventilated with either high tidal volume (HVT) or low tidal volume (LVT) for up to 4\u00a0h with either liberal or conservative fluid support. During ventilation, lung compliance, total lung capacity, and hysteresis curves were quantified. Following ventilation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed for total protein content and inflammatory cell infiltration. Wet to dry ratios were used to directly measure edema in excised lungs. Lung histology was performed to quantify alveolar barrier damage/destruction. Age matched non-ventilated mice were used as controls.At 4\u00a0h, both advanced age and HVT ventilation significantly increased markers of inflammation and injury, degraded pulmonary mechanics, and decreased survival rates. Conservative fluid support significantly diminished pulmonary edema and improved pulmonary mechanics by 1\u00a0h in advanced age HVT subjects. In 4\u00a0h ventilations, conservative fluid support significantly diminished pulmonary edema, improved lung mechanics, and resulted in significantly lower mortality rates in older subjects.Our study demonstrates that conservative fluid alone can attenuate the age associated increase in ventilator associated mortality.",

     "abstract": "Reductions in physical performance, cognitive impairment (CI) and decline (CD), are common in older age, but few prospective cohort studies have considered the relationship between these domains. In this study we investigated whether reduced physical performance and low handgrip/lower limbs strength, could predict a higher incidence of CI/CD during a 4-year follow-up among a cohort of elderly individuals. From 3099 older community-dwelling individuals initially enrolled in the Progetto Veneto Anziani (PRO.V.A.) study, 1249 participants without CI at the baseline were included (mean age 72.2\u00a0years, 59.5% females). Physical performance measures included the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), 4\u00a0m gait speed, chair stands time, leg extension and flexion, handgrip strength, and 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT), categorized in gender-specific tertiles. CI was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score below 24; CD a decline of 3 or more points in the MMSE without CI. At baseline, participants developing CI during follow-up scored significantly worse across all physical performance measures compared to those that retained normal cognitive status. After adjusting for potential confounders, a significant trend for MMSE changes was noted for all physical performance tests, except for the SPPB and chair stands time. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that slow gait speed at baseline significantly predicted CD at follow up. Poor SPPB performance and slower gait speed predicted the onset of CI at the follow-up. In conclusion, slow walking speed appears to be the best independent predictor of poor cognitive status over a 4.4-year follow-up, while other items of SPPB were also significantly associated with CI.",

Flow cytometry and clonogenic assay were used to assess cell proliferation; western blot analysis was used for assessing nuclear expression of SIRT1 and FoxO3. The nuclear co-localization of SIRT1 and FoxO3 was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Beta galactosidase (a senescence marker) and SIRT1 activity were assessed by specific staining and colorimetric assays, respectively. ChiP Assay and flow cytometry were used for assessing survivin gene regulation and protein expression, respectively.CSE decreased cell proliferation, the nuclear expression of SIRT1 and FoxO3 and increased beta galactosidase staining. CSE, reduced SIRT1 activity and FoxO3 localization on survivin promoter thus increasing survivin expression. In CSE stimulated bronchial epithelial cells carbocysteine reverted these phenomena by increasing cell proliferation, and SIRT1 and FoxO3 nuclear expression, and by reducing beta galactosidase staining and survivin expression.The study shows for the first time that carbocysteine may revert some senescence processes induced by oxidative stress due to cigarette smoke exposure.",

However, the production and regulation of endogenous levels of HMB over the lifespan have not been investigated.The objective of the present study was to do a cross-sectional analysis of the basal plasma levels of HMB in male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats of different ages and to compare the efficiency of conversion of leucine to HMB in young versus older rats.Plasma levels of HMB and \u03b1-ketoisocaproate (KIC) were analyzed in rats of different age groups (3, 9, 12 and 24\u00a0months old, n\u00a0=\u00a010 per group). Levels of 4-HPPD, the enzyme involved in the conversion of KIC to HMB in the liver were determined by ELISA. The conversion efficiency of leucine to HMB was compared between 3 and 24\u00a0month rats after an oral bolus dose of leucine.Endogenous circulating levels of HMB were significantly reduced in older age rats compared to young rats (100\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7 vs 156\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM), ng/mL, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A significant negative correlation was seen between HMB levels and age. The liver levels of 4-HPPD were found to be significantly lower in old versus young rats. Consistent with this, the conversion efficiency of leucine to HMB was significantly lower in the aged versus young cohorts.In summary, this study depicts for the first time that the basal levels of HMB, a metabolite of amino acid leucine, declines with age, and that this decline is due to perturbations in the key enzyme 4-HPPD which catalyzes the conversion of KIC to HMB. As a consequence, the efficiency of conversion of leucine to HMB is diminished in older rats compared to younger rats.",

Monocytes from the elderly have an inflammatory phenotype that may promote atherosclerotic plaque development; here we examined whether they are more atherogenic than those from younger individuals.Using an in vitro model of monocyte transmigration and foam cell formation, monocytes from older men (median age [range]: 75 [58\u201385] years, n\u00a0=\u00a020) formed foam cells more readily than those of younger men (32 [23\u201346] years, n\u00a0=\u00a020) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.003) following transmigration across a TNF-activated endothelial monolayer. Compared to young men, monocytes from the elderly had impaired cholesterol efflux and lower expression of regulators of cholesterol transport and metabolism. Foam cell formation was enhanced by soluble factors in serum from older men, but did not correlate with plasma lipid levels. Of the three subsets, intermediate monocytes formed the most foam cells.Therefore, both cellular changes to monocytes and soluble plasma factors in older men primes monocytes for foam cell formation following transendothelial migration, which may contribute to enhanced atherosclerosis in this population.",

At baseline, fallers showed significantly lower volumes in gray matter, subcortical regions, and cerebral white matter compared with non-fallers. Notably, fallers had significantly lower left lateral orbitofrontal white matter volume. Moreover, lower left lateral orbitofrontal white matter volume at baseline was associated with greater decline in set-shifting performance over 12\u00a0months.

PQQ may also function as an essential micronutrient during animal development. Recent studies have shown the therapeutic potential of PQQ for several age-related diseases due to its antioxidant capacity. However, whether PQQ can promote longevity is unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of PQQ on oxidative stress resistance as well as lifespan modulation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that PQQ enhances resistance to oxidative stress and extends the lifespan of C. elegans at optimal doses. The underlying molecular mechanism involves the increased activities of the primary lifespan extension transcriptional factors DAF-16/FOXO, the conserved oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2, and upregulation of daf-16, skn-1 downstream targets including sod-3, hsp16.2, gst-1 and gst-10. Our findings uncover a novel role of PQQ in longevity, supporting PQQ as a possible dietary supplement for overall health improvement.",

This study examined the effects of 12\u00a0weeks of power training on outcomes of voluntary muscle activation and gait speed in mobility-limited older adults from the Healthy Ageing Network of Competence (HANC) study. We included 37 older men and women with a usual gait speed of <\u00a00.9\u00a0m/s in the per-protocol analysis: n\u00a0=\u00a016 in the training group (TG: 12\u00a0weeks of progressive high-load power training, 2 sessions per week; age: 82.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0years, 56% women) and n\u00a0=\u00a021 in the control group (CG: no interventions; age: 81.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0years, 67% women). Knee extensor muscle thickness (ultrasonography), strength (isokinetic dynamometry), voluntary activation (interpolated twitch technique), and gait speed (2-min maximal walking test) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. At baseline, TG and CG were comparable for all measures. Post-intervention, significant between-group changes (TG vs. CG; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were observed for voluntary muscle activation (+\u00a06.2%), muscle strength (+\u00a013.4\u00a0Nm), and gait speed (+\u00a00.12\u00a0m/s), whereas the between-group change in muscle thickness was non-significant (+\u00a00.08\u00a0cm). Improvements in voluntary muscle activation were associated with improvements in gait speed in TG (r\u00a0=\u00a00.67, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

     "abstract": "Senescence accelerated mice P8 (SAMP8) is a phenotypic model of age, characterized by deficits in memory and altered behaviour. Here, we determined the effect of age in SAMP8, and compared with the resistant strain, SAMR1, in behaviour and learning parameters linking these disturbances with oxidative stress environment. We found impairment in emotional behaviour with regard to fear and anxiety in young SAMP8 vs. age-mated SAMR1. Differences were attenuated with age. In contrast, learning capabilities are worse in SAMP8, both in young and aged animals, with regard to SAMR1. These waves in behaviour and cognition were correlated with an excess of oxidative stress (OS) in SAMP8 at younger ages that diminished with age. In this manner, we found changes in the hippocampal expression of ALDH2, IL-6, HMOX1, COX2, CXCL10, iNOS, and MCP-1 with an altered amyloidogenic pathway by increasing the Amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and BACE1, and reduced ADAM10 expression; in addition, astrogliosis and neuronal markers decreased. Moreover, Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and Nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-k\u03b2) expression and protein levels were higher in younger SAMP8 than in SAMR1. In conclusion, the accelerated senescence process present in SAMP8 can be linked with an initial deregulation in redox homeostasis, named neuroinflammaging, by inducing molecular changes that lead to neuroinflammation and the neurodegenerative process. These changes are reflected in the emotional and cognitive behaviour of SAMP8 that differs from that of SAMR1 and that highlighted the importance of earlier oxidative processes in the onset of neurodegeneration.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia has been proposed as a potentially amenable factor impacting the clinical outcomes of hip-fractured elderly. The identification of specific biological targets is therefore crucial to developing pharmacological interventions against age-related muscle wasting. The present work reports promising preliminary data on the association between alterations of myocyte quality control (MQC) signaling and sarcopenia in old patients with hip fracture.Twenty-five elderly hip-fractured patients (20 women and 5 men; mean age 84.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.65\u00a0years) were enrolled as part of the Sarcopenia in HIp FracTure (SHIFT) study. Intraoperative biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained and assayed for the expression of a set of MQC signaling proteins. The presence of sarcopenia was established according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria, with bioelectrical impedance analysis used for fat-free mass estimation.Sarcopenia was identified in 10 patients (40%). Protein expression of the mitochondrial fusion factor mitofusin (Mfn) 2 and the autophagy mediator microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) was significantly lower in patients with sarcopenia compared with non-sarcopenic controls. No differences between groups were observed for Mfn1, optic atrophy protein 1 (OPA1), fission protein 1 (Fis1), and the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1).Data from this exploratory study show that a reduced expression of the mitochondrial fusion factor Mfn2 and the autophagy mediator LC3B is associated with sarcopenia in old hip-fractured patients. Future larger-scale studies are needed to corroborate these preliminary findings and determine whether MQC pathways may be targeted to improve muscle health and promote functional recovery in old patients with hip fracture.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether impaired gait coordination, as measured by the Phase Coordination Index (PCI), is significantly associated with mobility limitations in older adults, even after adjusting for other gait features.We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of performance-based measures of mobility in older adults (N\u00a0=\u00a0164) 77\u2013101\u00a0years of age, participants in the population-based MOBILIZE Boston Study. Mobility outcomes included the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and each of its three components. Multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for age and gender, were used to examine the associations of PCI and the coefficients of variation of stride length, width and time, stance time, and step width with each outcome.PCI accounted for more variance in SPPB score (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.21), gait speed (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.17), chair rise score (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.10), and balance score (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.09) than any of the other gait measures. Impaired gait coordination was significantly associated with performance on the SPPB and each of its component tasks, even after accounting for gait measures previously linked to mobility tasks (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In multivariable linear regression modeling PCI accounted for an additional 9% of the variance in SPPB score (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), after accounting for the other gait variables, age, and gender.This study shows that impaired gait coordination is associated with poorer mobility performance in older adults, independent of other gait variables previously linked to mobility tasks.",

     "abstract": "Modern cardiovascular risk prediction tools, which have their genesis in the Framingham Heart Study, have allowed more accurate risk stratification and targeting of treatments worldwide over the last seven decades. Better cardiovascular risk factor control during this time has led to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and, at least in part, to improved life expectancy. As a result, western societies as a whole have seen a steady increase in the proportion of older persons in their populations.Unfortunately, several studies have shown that the same tools which have contributed to this increase cannot be reliably extrapolated for use in older generations. Recent work has allowed recalibration of existing models for use in older populations but these modified tools still require external validation before they can be confidently applied in clinical practice. Another complication is emerging evidence that aggressive risk factor modification in older adults, particularly more frail individuals, may actually be harmful.This review looks at currently available cardiovascular risk prediction models and the specific challenges faced with their use in older adults, followed by analysis of recent attempts at recalibration for this cohort. We discuss the issue of frailty, looking at our evolving understanding of its constituent features and various tools for its assessment. We also review work to date on the impact of frailty on cardiovascular risk modification and outline its potentially central role in determining the most sensible approach in older patients. We summarise the most promising novel markers of cardiovascular risk which may be of use in improving risk prediction in older adults in the future. These include markers of vascular compliance (such as aortic pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis), of endothelial function (such as flow mediated dilation, carotid intima-media thickness and coronary artery calcium scores), and also biochemical and circulating cellular markers.",

The goal of this study was to determine if skeletal muscle injury induced by exposure to injurious stretch-shortening cycles (iSSCs), resulted in hyperalgesia in the hind limb and changes in calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) immunolabeling in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in young and old male rats.Young (3\u00a0months) and old (30\u00a0months) male Fisher 344\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0BN F1 rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and the left hind limbs were exposed to 15 sets of 10 SSCs. Control animals were exposed to a single bout of SSCs of equal intensity. Sensitivity to mechanical stimulation was assessed using von Frey filaments prior to beginning the experiment, and on days 2 and 9 following exposure to iSSCs. Rats were euthanized one, 3 or 10\u00a0days after the exposure. The ipsilateral DRG were dissected from the L4\u20135 region of the spine, along with the left tibialis anterior (LTA) muscle.Rats exposed to iSSCs were more sensitive to mechanical stimulation than control rats 2\u00a0days after the exposure, and showed a reduction in peak force 3\u00a0days after exposure. Changes in sensitivity to pressure were not associated with increases in CGRP labeling in the DRG at 3\u00a0days. However, 9\u00a0days after exposure to iSSCs, old rats still displayed an increased sensitivity to mechanical stimulation, and this hyperalgesia was associated with an increase in CGRP immunolabeling in the DRG. Young rats exposed to iSSC did not display a change in CGRP immunolabeling and sensitivity to mechanical stimulation returned to control levels at 10\u00a0days.These findings suggest that hyperalgesia seen shortly after exposure to iSSC is not influenced by CGRP levels. However, in cases where recovery from injury may be slower, as it is in older rats, CGRP may contribute to the maintenance of hyperalgesia.",

Physical activities were monitored, and venous blood and muscle biopsies collected.Physical activity was highest in the DA compared to both the IA and RE groups.

     "abstract": "Sirtuins are proteins that connect energy metabolism, oxidative stress and aging. Expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) is regulated by heat shock factors (HSFs) in response to various environmental and physiological stresses, such as oxidative stress. Oxidative stress accumulates during aging which makes cells more prone to DNA damage. Although many experimental animal models have been designed to study the effects of knockdown or overexpression of sirtuins, HSFs and Hsps, little is known about how aging per se affects their expression. Here we study the impact of intrinsic aerobic capacity, aging and voluntary exercise on the levels of sirtuins, HSFs and Hsps in skeletal muscle.We studied the protein levels of sirtuins (SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5, SIRT6 and SIRT7), HSF1, HSF2, Hsp10, Hsp27 and Hsp70 before and after one-year of voluntary running intervention of rat strains selectively bred for intrinsic aerobic exercise capacity; high capacity runners (HCR) and low capacity runners (LCR) differ by more than 30% for median lifespan. This setup enabled us to discern the effects of inborn aerobic capacity, aging and exercise activity on the protein levels of sirtuins, HSFs and Hsps in skeletal muscle.Our results revealed that the longer lived HCR rats had higher SIRT3, HSF1 and HSF2 contents in skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius, p < 0.05) than LCRs. Neither aging nor voluntary running had a significant effect on the studied sirtuin proteins. Aging significantly increased the protein levels of HSF1, HSF2 and Hsp27 (p < 0.05).Our finding of elevated SIRT3 levels in HCR rats is in line with previous studies; SIRT3 in general is linked to elevated fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation, which previously have been associated with metabolic profile of HCRs. HSF1, HSF2 and Hsp27 levels increased with aging, showing that aged muscles responded to aging-related stress. Our study shows for the first time that SIRT3 protein level is linked to high inborn aerobic capacity, and may be directly interconnected to longevity.",

Age, years in school, number of past days in bed due to health problems, number of times that consulted a physician last year for health problems, having smoked in the past, and life satisfaction were associated with frailty when using any of the tools.There is a persistent heterogeneity on how frailty is measured that should be addressed in future research.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the intrinsic dysconnectivity pattern of whole-brain functional networks at the voxel level in D-AD patients based on degree centrality (DC) as measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI). Our study included 32 AD patients. All patients were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and further divided into two groups: 15 D-AD patients and 17 non-depressed AD (nD-AD) patients. R-fMRI datasets were acquired from these D-AD and nD-AD patients. First, we performed a DC analysis to identify voxels that showed altered whole brain functional connectivity (FC) with other voxels. We then further investigated FC using the abnormal DC regions to examine in more detail the connectivity patterns of the identified DC changes. D-AD patients had lower DC values in the right middle frontal, precentral, and postcentral gyrus than nD-AD patients. Seed-based analysis revealed decreased connectivity between the precentral and postcentral gyrus to the supplementary motor area and middle cingulum. FC also decreased in the right middle frontal, precentral, and postcentral gyrus. Thus, AD patients with depression fit a \u2018network dysfunction model\u2019 distinct from major depressive disorder and AD.",

Long term TP treatment improved the motor coordination dysfunction with aging. Increased tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter, as well as dopamine and its metabolites were found in the NSDA system of TP-treated 24\u00a0month-old male rats, indicative of the amelioratory effects of TP supplements on NSDA system of aged male rats. The enhancement of dopaminergic (DAergic) activity of NSDA system by TP supplements might underlie the amelioration of the coordinated motor dysfunction in aged male rats. TP supplements up-regulated VMAT2 expression in NSDA system of aged male rats. Up-regulation of VMAT2 expression in aged male rats following chronic TP treatment might be involved in the maintenance of DAergic function of NSDA system in aged male rats.",

     "abstract": "Environmental temperature greatly affects lifespan in a wide variety of animals, but the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are still largely unknown. A moderate temperature decrease from 22\u00a0\u00b0C to 16\u00a0\u00b0C extends the lifespan of the monogonont rotifer Brachionus manjavacas by up to 163%. Thermodynamic effects on metabolism contribute to this increase in longevity, but are not the only cause. When rotifers are exposed to 16\u00a0\u00b0C for four days and then transfered to 22\u00a0\u00b0C, they survive until day 13 at nearly identical rates as rotifers maintained at 16\u00a0\u00b0C continuously. This persistence of the higher survival for nine days after transfer to 22\u00a0\u00b0C suggests that low temperature exposure alters the expression of genes that affect the rate of aging. The relative persistence of the gene regulation effect suggests that it may play an even larger role in slowing aging than the thermodynamic effects. The life extending effects of these short-term low temperature treatments are largest when the exposure happens early in the life cycle, demonstrating the importance of early development. There is no advantage to lowering the temperature below 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 11\u00b0 or 5\u00a0\u00b0C. Rotifers exposed to 16\u00a0\u00b0C also displayed increased resistance to heat, starvation, oxidative and osmotic stress. Reproductive rates at 16\u00a0\u00b0C were lower than those at 22\u00a0\u00b0C, but because they reproduce longer, there is no significant change in the lifetime fecundity of females. To investigate which genes contribute to these effects, the expression of specific temperature sensing genes was knocked down using RNAi. Of 12 genes tested, RNAi knockdown of four eliminated the survival enhancing effects of the four-day cold treatment: TRP7, forkhead box C, Y-box factor, and ribosomal protein S6. This demonstrates that active gene regulation is an important factor in temperature mediated life extension, and that these particular genes play an integral role in these pathways. As a thermoresponsive sensor, TRP7 may be responsible for triggering the signaling cascade contributing to temperature mediated life extension. The TRP genes may also provide especially promising candidates for targeted gene manipulations or pharmacological interventions capable of mimicking the effects of low temperature exposure. These results support recent theories of aging that claim rate of aging is determined by an actively regulated genetic mechanism rather than an accumulation of molecular damage.",

Moreover, to determine whether an enriched-antioxidant diet may be useful to prevent age-related disorders, we orally administered to the two genotypes a melon concentrate rich in superoxide dismutase for 12\u00a0weeks. We reported that mitochondrial functional abnormalities persisted (decreased state 3 and 4 of respiration; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in skeletal muscle from aged KO mice; however, differences with WT mice were attenuated at old age in line with reduced difference on running endurance between the two genotypes. Interestingly, we showed an increase in glutathione levels, associated with lower lipid peroxidation levels in KO muscle. Enriched antioxidant diet reduced the aging-related negative effects on maximal aerobic velocity and running limit time (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in both groups, with systemic adaptations on body weight. The redox status and the hypertrophic phenotype appeared to be beneficial to KO mice, mitigating the effect of aging on the skeletal muscle metabolic remodeling.",

Our previous studies suggest a role for increased hepatic \u03b2-AR-mediated signaling during aging as a mediator of hepatic steatosis, liver glucose output, and insulin resistance in rodents. In the current study, we have utilized \u03b22-AR knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) control mice to define further the role of \u03b22-AR signaling during aging on lipid and glucose metabolism. Our results demonstrate for the first time that age-related increases in hepatic triglyceride accumulation and body weight are attenuated upon \u03b22-AR ablation. Although no differences in plasma triglyceride, non-esterified fatty acids or insulin levels were detected between old WT and KO animals, an age-associated increase in hepatic expression of lipid homeostasis regulator Cidea was significantly reduced in old KO mice. Interestingly, we also observed a shift from reduced glucose tolerance in young adult KO animals to significantly improved glucose tolerance in old KO when compared to age-matched WT mice. These results provide evidence for an important role played by \u03b22-ARs in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism during aging. The effect of \u03b22-AR ablation on caloric intake during aging is currently not known and requires investigation. Future studies are also warranted to delineate the \u03b22-AR-mediated mechanisms involved in the control of lipid and glucose homeostasis, especially in the context of a growing aging population.",

While most studies on immunosenescence have focused on adaptive immunity, the effects of aging on innate immunity are not well understood. Here, we investigated whether aging affects cytokine responses to a wide range of well-defined pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands, such as ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I like receptors (RLRs) and the cytosolic DNA sensor absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2).Blood was collected from 16 young (20\u201339\u00a0years) and 18 elderly (60\u201384\u00a0years) healthy participants. Pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8) production in a whole blood assay (WBA) after stimulation with TLR ligands (Pam3csk4, poly(I:C), LPS, CpG), CLR ligand (\u03b2-glucan), NLR ligand (MDP), RLR ligands (5\u2032ppp-dsDNA and poly(I:C)/lyovec) and the AIM2 ligand (poly(dA:dT) was assessed by ELISA. TLR2 and TLR4 expression by leukocytes and monocytes was determined by flow-cytometry. Expression of AIM2 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot.Cytokine responses to Pam3csk4, poly(I:C) and CpG, \u03b2-glucan, MDP, 5\u2032ppp-dsDNA and poly(I:C)/lyovec were comparable between young and old participants. We observed a higher IL-8 response following stimulation of elderly blood samples with the TLR4 ligand LPS, which was associated with higher proportions of TLR4 expressing monocytes. Interestingly, stimulation of whole blood cells with the AIM2 ligand poly(dA:dT) resulted in significantly lower cytokine responses in old participants. Moreover, these lower cytokine responses were associated with lower AIM2 protein expression and activation in PBMC of old participants.Our findings reveal an age-dependent reduction of AIM2 expression and activation which may explain reduced cytokine responses to the cytosolic DNA mimic poly(dA:dT) in healthy elderly individuals. Reduced AIM2-mediated sensing with age may contribute to increased vulnerability to bacterial or viral infections in the elderly.",

No restrictions were placed on study type. This article focuses on the relation between CMV infections as measured by serology and T cell subsets. A narrative approach to data synthesis was applied.In the majority of included studies higher levels of Effector Memory (EM) and TEMRA (Effector Memory T cells re-expressing CD45RA) cells were found in the CD4+ and the CD8+ T cell pools in CMV-seropositive elderly compared to CMV-seronegative elderly.

Previous studies have indicated that frailty phenotype can be identified through electromyography (EMG) when collected over the course of an 8-h day.

Bursts and gaps in EMG of the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, vastus lateralis, and biceps femoris were measured bilaterally during nine different functional tasks.Relatively high levels of success for frailty group classification (near 90%) can be achieved from EMG. Bursts were more frequent and gaps fewer in frail compared with middle-aged and non-frail adults. The numbers of gaps and muscle quiescence in the upper limbs were particularly important. Changes in muscle activity offer predictive value in identifying frailty phenotype. Completing functional tasks (rising from the floor, toilet and chair) while undergoing EMG assessment can contribute to the identification of differences in frailty phenotype among older adults.",

We have previously shown that different dietary fat sources can modulate life span and mitochondrial ultrastructure, function and membrane fatty acid composition in mice maintained on a 40% CR. In particular, animals consuming lard as the main fat source (CR-Lard) lived longer than CR mice consuming diets with soybean oil (CR-Soy) or fish oil (CR-Fish) as the predominant lipid source. In the present work, a transcriptomic analysis in the liver and skeletal muscle was performed in order to elucidate possible mechanisms underlying the changes in energy metabolism and longevity induced by dietary fat in CR mice. After 8\u00a0months of CR, transcription downstream of several mediators of inflammation was inhibited in liver. In contrast, proinflammatory signaling was increased in the CR-Fish versus other CR groups. Dietary fish oil induced a gene expression pattern consistent with increased transcriptional regulation by several cytokines (TNF, GM-CSF, TGF-\u03b2) and sex hormones when compared to the other CR groups. The CR-Fish also had lower expression of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and increased expression of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation genes than the other CR diet groups. Our data suggest that a diet high in n-3 PUFA, partially reverts CR-related changes in gene expression of key processes, such as inflammation and steroid hormone signaling, and this may mitigate life span extension with CR in mice consuming diets high in fish oil.",

Plantar flexor (PF) and dorsal flexor (DF) torques generated in the upright posture were estimated from the torque\u2013EMG relationship obtained during submaximum contractions in the seated position. Center of pressure (CoP) displacement was measured to quantify postural stability. Results showed that, in upright standing, EF generated greater ankle muscle relative torque (i.e. PF\u00a0+\u00a0DF torque in the upright stance/PF\u00a0+\u00a0DF during maximum isometric torque) than non-fallers (i.e. ENF, YA). The greater involvement of ankle muscles in EF was associated with higher CoP displacement. PF\u00a0+\u00a0DF torque in the upright stance was no different among the groups, but PF\u00a0+\u00a0DF torque during maximum effort was impaired in older groups compared with YA and was lower in EF than ENF. These results suggest that the postural stability impairment observed with aging is highly related to ankle muscle weakness.",

It is not known whether gray matter integrity is associated with higher lap time variation (LTV), a clinically accessible measure of gait variability, high levels of which have been associated with mortality. This study examines the cross-sectional association between gray matter mean diffusivity (MD) and LTV in community-dwelling older adults.Study participants consisted of 449 high-functioning adults aged 50 and older (56.8% female) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, free of overt neurological disease. The magnitude of MD in the gray matter, a measure of impaired tissue integrity, was assessed by diffusion tensor imaging in 16 regions of interest (ROIs) involved with executive function, sensorimotor function, and memory. LTV was assessed as variability in lap time based on individual trajectories over ten 40-m laps. Age, sex, height, and weight were covariates. The model additionally adjusted for mean lap time and health conditions that may affect LTV.Higher levels of average MD across 16 ROIs were significantly associated with higher LTV after adjustment for covariates. Specifically, higher MD in the precuneus and the anterior and middle cingulate cortices was strongly associated with higher LTV, as compared to other ROIs. The association persisted after adjustment for mean lap time, hypertension, and diabetes.Lower gray matter integrity in selected areas may underlie greater LTV in high-functioning community-dwelling older adults. Longitudinal studies are warranted to examine whether changes in gray matter integrity precede more variable gait.",

     "abstract": "Eusocial insects provide special insights into the genetic pathways influencing aging because of their long-lived queens and flexible aging schedules. Using qRT-PCR in the primitively eusocial bumble bee Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus), we investigated expression levels of four candidate genes associated with taxonomically widespread age-related pathways (coenzyme Q biosynthesis protein 7, COQ7; DNA methyltransferase 3, Dnmt3; foraging, for; and vitellogenin, vg). In Experiment 1, we tested how expression changes with queen relative age and productivity. We found a significant age-related increase in COQ7 expression in queen ovary. In brain, all four genes showed higher expression with increasing female (queen plus worker) production, with this relationship strengthening as queen age increased, suggesting a link with the positive association of fecundity and longevity found in eusocial insect queens. In Experiment 2, we tested effects of relative age and social environment (worker removal) in foundress queens and effects of age and reproductive status in workers. In this experiment, workerless queens showed significantly higher for expression in brain, as predicted if downregulation of for is associated with the cessation of foraging by foundress queens following worker emergence. Workers showed a significant age-related increase in Dnmt3 expression in fat body, suggesting a novel association between aging and methylation in B. terrestris. Ovary activation was associated with significantly higher vg expression in fat body and, in younger workers, in brain, consistent with vitellogenin's ancestral role in regulating egg production. Overall, our findings reveal a mixture of novel and conserved features in age-related genetic pathways under primitive eusociality.",

The primary aim of the present study was to assess the effects of exercise training status on serum FLCs in older adults, and secondly, to examine if training status moderated serum FLC responses to acute exercise. Kappa and lambda serum FLC levels were measured in 45 healthy older adults (aged \u2265\u00a060\u00a0years) who were either sedentary, physically active or endurance trained. FLCs were measured at baseline and in response to an acute bout of submaximal exercise. The endurance trained group had significantly lower levels of kappa and lambda serum FLCs compared with physically active or sedentary elderly adults; these effects were independent of age, BMI and renal function. There was no significant difference in whole immunoglobulins between groups. Exercise training status had no effect on serum FLC responses to acute exercise, which were marginal. In conclusion, endurance training was associated with lower FLC levels compared with less physically active individuals. These findings suggest that long-term endurance training may be beneficial in reducing basal inflammation in older adults as well as elevated FLCs present in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, often associated with ageing. FLCs may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of exercise intervention studies in healthy and clinical populations.",

To date, little attention has been given to the potential effects of physical activity on sleep quality and fatigue in aging. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between activity, sleep and fatigue across the adult lifespan. Sixty community-dwelling adults were studied; 22 younger (21\u201329\u00a0years), 16 middle-aged (36\u201364\u00a0years), and 22 older (65\u201381\u00a0years). Physical activity was measured by accelerometer. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Self-reported fatigue was evaluated with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Regression analysis revealed a positive relationship between activity and sleep quality in the older (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.18, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), but not the younger (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.041, p\u00a0=\u00a00.35) or middle-aged (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.001, p\u00a0=\u00a00.93) groups. This association was mainly established by the relationship between moderate-vigorous activity and sleep quality (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.37, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) in older adults. No association was observed between physical activity and self-reported fatigue in any of the groups (r2\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.14, p\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.15).

Older age, co-morbidities and obesity are all associated with frailty syndrome. In the core of both frailty and sarcopenia there are dysfunction and deterioration of the muscle and the fat tissues. This overview interlinks the phenotypes presented in older adults such as sarcopenia and frailty\u2014alone and with relation to obesity, muscle function and fat tissue accumulation.Observational studies have well described the loss of muscle mass and strength through the years of adult life, both components of frailty and sarcopenia. They have shown that these changes are associated with dysmetabolism and functional deterioration, independent of common explanatory variables. In the metabolic mechanism core of this link, insulin resistance and higher ectopic fat accumulation may play a role. Basic experiments have partially validated this hypothesis. Whether there is a synergistic effect of obesity and frailty phenotype on morbidity risk is still questionable and currently under investigation; however, few cohort studies have shown that the frail\u2013obese or sarcopenic\u2013obese group have higher probability for metabolic complications.Muscle mass loss and fat accumulation in the muscle in the elderly, with or without the presence of obesity, may explain some of the functional and metabolic defects shown in the frail, sarcopenic population.",

Five-month-old female SAMR1 and SAMP8 were divided into three groups: sham-operated, ovariectomized and ovariectomized plus estradiol. Twenty-eight days after surgery, thoracic aortic rings were mounted for isometric recording of tension and concentration\u2013response curves for U46619 (10\u2212\u00a010\u20133\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M) were performed in the absence and in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10\u2212\u00a04\u00a0M) and/or COX inhibitor indomethacin (10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0M). Vascular superoxide production was detected by dihydroethidium staining on sections of thoracic aorta. NO bioavailability in response to U46619 was suppressed by estrogen withdrawn in young and senescent mice and was restored by the administration of estradiol. In the presence of indomethacin, contractions to U46619 decreased in all groups indicating an aging- and estrogen-dependent modulation of contractile prostanoids. The simultaneous incubation of L-NAME and indomethacin did not change the maximal responses and sensitivities to TXA2 in any group in comparison with untreated aortic segments. The superoxide generation induced by TXA2 was greater in aorta from SAMP8 than in SAMR1. Moreover, in ovariectomized groups superoxide production was further increased and treatment with 17\u03b2-estradiol reverted the effects of the ovariectomy. Inhibition of COX with indomethacin prevented the U46619-induced increase in superoxide formation. Our results indicate that NO bioavailability in response to TP receptor activation is both estrogen- and aging-dependent. TXA2 induced contractions are partially mediated by COX activation. Both aging and ovariectomy enhanced COX-dependent component of the TXA2-induced contraction. It is noteworthy that in the absence of estrogen, COX inhibition induces an increase of NO bioavailability. Therefore, in senescent female mice with an experimental menopause, TP-receptor stimulation is responsible for COX activation and enhanced superoxide generation, which may result in reduced NO bioavailability. These effects were reversed by estrogen administration.",

A cross-sectional analysis of 903 subjects from the population-based \u201cInveCe.Ab\u201d study was performed. The participants had no psychosis or active neurological disorders.

Novel components were evaluated for association with tHcy, controlling for potential confounders. Regression models showed that high serum tHcy was associated with lower executive functions, but not with memory. MTHFR C677T TT was associated with higher tHcy but did not affect cognitive performance per se. However, when combined with the apolipoprotein E (APOE)-\u03b54 allele, it was a risk factor for lower executive performance, independently of tHcy levels.

     "abstract": "Primates tend to be long-lived for their size with humans being the longest lived of all primates. There are compelling reasons to understand the underlying age-related processes that shape human lifespan. But the very fact of our long lifespan that makes it so compelling, also makes it especially difficult to study. Thus, in studies of aging, researchers have turned to non-human primate models, including chimpanzees, baboons, and rhesus macaques. More recently, the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, has been recognized as a particularly valuable model in studies of aging, given its small size, ease of housing in captivity, and relatively short lifespan. However, little is known about the physiological changes that occur as marmosets age. To begin to fill in this gap, we utilized high sensitivity metabolomics to define the longitudinal biochemical changes associated with age in the common marmoset. We measured 2104 metabolites from blood plasma at three separate time points over a 17-month period, and we completed both a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the metabolome. We discovered hundreds of metabolites associated with age and body weight in both male and female animals. Our longitudinal analysis identified age-associated metabolic pathways that were not found in our cross-sectional analysis. Pathways enriched for age-associated metabolites included tryptophan, nucleotide, and xenobiotic metabolism, suggesting these biochemical pathways might play an important role in the basic mechanisms of aging in primates. Moreover, we found that many metabolic pathways associated with age were sex specific. Our work illustrates the power of longitudinal approaches, even in a short time frame, to discover novel biochemical changes that occur with age.",

Engaging in positive social interaction is associated with many health benefits, including reduced stress reactivity, and may serve as a potential buffer against adverse consequences of aging. The goal of these studies was to establish a tractable model for the assessment of social behavior deficits associated with late aging. Thus, in Exp. 1, 1.5-, 3-, and 18-month-old male Fischer 344 (F344) rats were assessed for object investigation, and social interaction with a same-aged partner (novel/familiar), or a different-aged partner, thereby establishing working parameters for studies that followed. Results revealed that 18-month-old males exhibited reductions in social investigation and social contact behavior, with this age-related decline not influenced by familiarity or age of the social partner. Subsequently, Exp. 2 extended assessment of social behavior to both male and female F344 rats at multiple ages (3, 9, 18, and 24\u00a0months), after which a series of sensorimotor performance tests were conducted. In this study, both males and females exhibited late aging-related reductions in social interactions, but these changes were more pronounced in females. Additionally, sensorimotor performance was shown to be impaired in 24-month-olds, but not 18-month-olds, with this deficit more evident in males. Finally, Exp. 3 examined whether aging-related inflammation could account for declines in social behavior during late aging by administering naproxen (0, 7, 14, and 28\u00a0mg/kg; s.c.)\u2014a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug\u2014to 18-month-old females. Results from this study revealed that social behavior was unaffected by acute or repeated (6\u00a0days) naproxen, suggesting that aging-related social deficits in females may not be a consequence of a general aging-related inflammation and/or malaise. Together, these findings demonstrate that aging-related declines in social behavior are (i) specific to social stimuli and (ii) not indicative of a general state of aging-related debilitation. Thus, these findings establish working parameters for a highly tractable model in which the neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying aging-related declines in social behavior can be examined.",

In the present study, we identified concordant increases in miR-34a levels in the cochlea, auditory cortex, and plasma of C57BL/6 mice during aging. These increases were accompanied by elevated hearing thresholds and greater loss of hair cells. Levels of miR-34a targets, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3), in the cochlea, auditory cortex, and plasma decreased with aging inversely to miR-34a. Moreover, plasma miR-34a levels were significantly higher in patients with AHL compared with controls who had normal hearing and had a receiver-operating characteristic curve that distinguished AHL patients from controls. However, SIRT1, Bcl-2, and E2F3 showed no correlation with AHL in humans. In summary, circulating miR-34a level may potentially serve as a useful biomarker for early detection of AHL.",

This study aims to compare the regional and global brain volume patterns associated with gait performances assessed with Timed Up and Go test (TUG) between cognitively healthy individuals (CHI) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).A total of 171 (80 CHI, 25 with amnestic MCI [a-MCI] and 66 with non-amnestic MCI [na-MCI]) participants (70.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0years; 37% female) consecutively realized (rTUG) and imagined (iTUG) the TUG. rTUG measures the time needed to rise from a chair, walk 3\u00a0m, turn around and return to a seated position and iTUG represents the validated imagined version of the TUG. Global and regional brain volumes were quantified from three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI using a semi-automated software.Linear regression models show that increased rTUG (i.e. worse performance) was associated with lower total white matter, total gray matter, left and right hippocampal volume in patients with na-MCI (P\u00a0<\u00a00.045), and with lower right hippocampal volume in CHI (P\u00a0=\u00a00.013). Increased iTUG was associated with lower gray matter and left premotor cortex volumes in patients with na-MCI (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The findings showed different patterns of brain volume reduction associated with increased rTUG and iTUG between CHI and MCI patients, except for the right hippocampal volume which was smaller in both groups.",

     "abstract": "Aging strongly affects the skeletal muscle and is associated with microvascular dysfunctions. Age is also a primary risk factor for the metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of metabolic and cardiovascular symptoms. Among the metabolic syndrome components, hypertension is the most prevalent in elderly subjects and has a central role in vascular alterations. Despite critical clinical outcomes, the effects of hypertension and metabolic syndrome on skeletal muscle capillarization have poorly been investigated during aging. In the present study, muscle biopsies from normotensive young (YO) and elderly (ELc) men, and elderly men with hypertension (EL-HT) or metabolic syndrome (EL-MS) were assessed for the number of capillaries around a fiber (CAF), capillary-to-fiber perimeter exchange (CFPE), length of contact to perimeter of fiber ratio (LC/PF), capillary tortuosity, and for extracellular matrix (ECM) embedding capillaries. As capillarization and muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity may be associated, we also investigated cytochrome c oxidase (COX) content. Our findings indicate that capillarization and COX did not change between normotensive adult and old individuals. They further reveal that hypertension in elderly men is associated with reduced CAF (ELc: 5.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4, EL-HT: 4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2, P\u00a0<\u00a00.02 for type I fibers; ELc: 4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2, EL-HT: 3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3, P\u00a0<\u00a00.03 for type IIA fibers), CFPE (ELc: 7.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7, EL-HT: 6.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 capillaries/1000\u00a0\u03bcm, P\u00a0<\u00a00.03 for type I fibers; ELc: 6.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4, EL-HT: 5.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 capillaries/1000\u00a0\u03bcm, P\u00a0<\u00a00.03 for type IIA fibers), LC/PF (ELc: 23.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2, EL-HT: 17.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 for type I fibers; ELc: 19.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1, EL-HT: 15.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 for type IIA fibers) and capillary tortuosity, and with ECM endomysium fibrosis. Capillary rarefaction also correlated with lower COX content in the old hypertensive muscle. No further modification occurred with metabolic syndrome in elderly men. Collectively, our results suggest that hypertension plays a central role in muscle capillarization during aging, and that the other components of metabolic syndrome do not make major additional changes in the aged skeletal muscle capillary network.",

     "abstract": "Aging is associated with an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. The aging lung is particularly affected since it is continuously exposed to environmental oxidants while antioxidant machinery weakens with age. Melatonin, a free radical scavenger, counteracts inflammation and apoptosis in healthy cells from several tissues. Its effects on the aging lung are, however, not yet fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the effect of chronic administration of melatonin on the expression of inflammation markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, NF\u03baB2, HO-1) and apoptosis parameters (BAD, BAX, AIF) in the lung tissue of male senescence-accelerated prone mice (SAMP8). In addition, RNA oxidative damage, as the formation of 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), was also evaluated. Young and old animals, aged 2 and 10\u00a0months respectively, were divided into 4 groups: untreated young, untreated old, old mice treated with 1\u00a0mg/kg/day melatonin, and old animals treated with 10\u00a0mg/kg/day melatonin. Untreated young and old male senescence accelerated resistant mice (SAMR1) were used as controls. After 30\u00a0days of treatment, animals were sacrificed. Lungs were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. mRNA and protein expressions were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Levels of 8-OHG were quantified by ELISA. Mean values were analyzed using ANOVA. Old nontreated SAMP8 animals showed increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) mRNA and protein levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, NF\u03baB2, and HO-1 compared to young mice and SAMR1 mice. Melatonin treatment with either dose reversed the aging-derived inflammation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). BAD, BAX and AIF expressions also rose with aging, the effect being counteracted with melatonin (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Aging also caused a significant elevation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in SAMP8 8-OHG values. This increase was not observed in animals treated with melatonin (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, melatonin treatment was able to modulate the inflammatory and apoptosis status of the aging lungs, exerting a protective effect on age-induced damage.",

Given the age-related decline in skeletal muscle function, we investigated whether the natural physiological process of aging is associated with altered abundance of NKA isoforms (\u03b11,\u03b12,\u03b13,\u03b21,\u03b22,\u03b23) or of the commonly used control protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

Seventeen healthy older (AGED, 69.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0years, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) and 14 younger (YOUNG, 25.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\u00a0years) adults underwent a muscle biopsy for biochemical analyses. Comparing homogenates from AGED and YOUNG individuals revealed higher \u03b23 isoform (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and lower GAPDH (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Analysis of individual fibers in muscle from YOUNG individuals, showed greater \u03b13 and \u03b22 isoforms, and more GAPDH in Type II compared with Type I fibers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the AGED, GAPDH was higher in Type II compared with Type I fibers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), there were no fiber type differences in the NKA isoforms (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Compared with the same fiber type in YOUNG, \u03b11 was greater (Type I) and \u03b13 lower (Type II), while in both fiber types, \u03b22 was lower, \u03b23 greater and GAPDH lower, in muscle from AGED individuals (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Overall, we demonstrate that (i) GAPDH is an inappropriate choice of protein for normalization in all skeletal muscle research and (ii) full understanding of the role of NKA isoforms in human skeletal muscle requires consideration of age and muscle fiber type.",

     "abstract": "Aging often results in progressive losses of functioning nephrons, which can lead to a significant reduction in overall renal function. Because of age-related pathological changes, the remaining functional nephrons within aged kidneys may be unable to fully counteract physiological and/or toxicological challenges. We hypothesized that when the total functional renal mass of aged rats is reduced by 50%, the nephrons within the remnant kidney do not fully undergo the functional and physiological changes that are necessary to maintain normal fluid and solute homeostasis. We also tested the hypothesis that the disposition and handling of a nephrotoxicant are altered significantly in aged kidneys following an acute, 50% reduction in functional renal mass. To test these hypotheses, we examined molecular indices of renal cellular hypertrophy and the disposition of inorganic mercury (Hg2+), a model nephrotoxicant, in young control, young uninephrectomized (NPX), aged control and aged NPX Wistar rats. We found that the process of aging reduces the ability of the remnant kidney to undergo compensatory renal growth. In addition, we found that an additional reduction in renal mass in aged animals alters the disposition of Hg2+ and potentially alters the risk of renal intoxication by this nephrotoxicant. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report of the handling of a nephrotoxicant in an aged animal following a 50% reduction in functional renal mass.",

In Experiment 2, designed to investigate possible changes in spatial attention, the same participants performed an exogenous orienting attention task.Experiment 1 showed that the three age groups performed the task similarly but differed in processing speed. Importantly, the oldest-old group showed a different perceptual pattern than the other groups suggesting a lack of specificity in visual asymmetries. Experiment 2 indicated that the validity effects emerged later in the young-old and even later in the oldest-old participants, showing a delayed time course of inhibition of return (IOR). Orienting effects, however, were preserved with age.Taken together, these results indicate that the three age groups displayed similar perceptual and orienting attention patterns, but with differences in processing speed. Importantly, age (only in the oldest-old adults) altered perceptual visual asymmetries. These results suggest that some neural plasticity is still present even in oldest-old adults, but a lack of specificity occurs in advanced age.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between MCI and number of falls or occurrence of non-accidental falls among older adults.Data from the first wave of the Irish longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) was analysed. The analytical sample consisted of 5364 individuals aged \u2265\u00a050\u00a0years. MCI was defined as: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score\u00a0<\u00a026; the presence of subjective cognitive complaints; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score\u00a0\u2265\u00a014; and no limitations in activities of daily living (ADL). Multivariable Poisson and logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between MCI and number of falls or the presence of non-accidental falls in the past 12\u00a0months.The prevalence of MCI was 10.1%. In the fully-adjusted model, MCI was associated with a higher rate of falls (PR\u00a0=\u00a01.41 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u20131.89) and odds for non-accidental falls in the past 12\u00a0months (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.67 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.07\u20132.61). Muscle strength and performance indicators, and medical health conditions were influential factors in the association between MCI and falls but did not fully explain the association.MCI is related with higher rates of falls and the occurrence of non-accidental falls among older adults.

It has also been reported that ER stress is considered to be a common mediator of apoptosis in neurodegenerative disorders like AD. However, the precise mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death caused by ER stress in AD remain unclear. Hsp70, the major inducible form of the heat shock protein family, functions at the level of chaperone-mediated protein folding. Enhanced expression of Hsp70 suppresses the neurotoxicity caused by protein misfolding. EGb761, an accepted traditional Chinese medicine used to treat AD, was used here to examine the molecular mechanism underlying its protective effect on ER stress and Hsp70. Our study shows that pretreatment with EGb761 overcomes the neurotoxicity of the A\u03b21-42 oligomer by increasing Hsp70, Grp78, IRE1\u03b1 and pAkt expression in a dose-dependent manner and significantly decreases cell apoptosis-related protein expression. Our findings suggest that the neuroprotective effect of EGb761 is related to ER stress activation and increased Hsp70 expression, and subsequent activation of Akt. However, the effect of EGb761 on these processes is not direct.",

Emerging evidence has suggested that senescence and autophagy appear to be regulated by overlapping signaling pathways. Furthermore, autophagy markers have been observed in senescent cells. In this study, we sought to explore the effects of the expression pattern and function of p53 on the activity of autophagy and replicative senescence in bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs). We found that more than 85% of BMSCs stained positive for SA-\u03b2-gal at passage 6 (senescent BMSCs) with increased expressions of senescence related genes (p16ink4a and p21waf1). These results were accompanied by the up-regulation of p53, down-regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphorylation of Rb. Senescent BMSCs displayed an increased monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining and autophagy related genes (LC3 and atg12) level compared with BMSCs at passage 2. Knockdown of p53 alleviated the senescent state and reduced autophagic activity during the progression of BMSC senescence, which was accompanied by significantly up-regulated levels of mTOR and phosphorylation of Rb. These results demonstrate that autophagy increases when BMSCs enter the replicative senescence state, and p53 contributes a crucial role in the up-regulation of autophagy in this state.",

Loss of B cell tolerance in the elderly is suggested by an increased prevalence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) and rheumatoid factors (RFs). Accumulating evidence indicates that B cells also impact autoimmunity via secretion of cytokines. So far, few studies have directly assessed the effect of aging on the latter B cell function. Here, we determined if and how human aging influences the production of cytokines by B cells. In a cross-sectional study, we found that absolute numbers of circulating B cells were similar in 31 young (ages 19\u201339) and 73 old (age\u00a0\u2265\u00a060) individuals. Numbers of transitional B cells (CD19+\u00a0CD27\u2212\u00a0CD38HighCD24High) were decreased in old individuals, whereas numbers of naive and memory B cell subsets were comparable in young and old individuals. Short-term in vitro stimulation of whole blood samples revealed that numbers of B cells capable of producing TNF-\u03b1 were similar in young and old individuals. In contrast, B cells capable of IL-10 production were decreased in old subjects. This decline of IL-10+ B cells was observed in old individuals that were ANA positive, and in those that were negative for both ANAs and RFs. However, IL-10+ B cells were remarkably well retained in the circulation of old subjects that were RF positive. Thus, pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1+ B cells are retained in the elderly, whereas IL-10+ B cells generally decline. In addition, our findings indicate that IL-10+ B cells may differentially impact the development of ANAs and RFs in the elderly.",

Differences in telomere length (TL) have been reported as possible risk factors for several neuropsychiatric disorders, including PD. Results from published studies for TL in PD are inconsistent, highlighting the need for a meta-analysis. In the current work, a meta-analysis of published studies for TL in PD was carried out. PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were used to identify relevant articles that reported TL in groups of PD patients and controls. A random-effects model was used for meta-analytical procedures. The meta-analysis included eight primary studies, derived from populations of European and Asian descent, and did not show a significant difference in TL between 956 PD patients and 1284 controls (p value: 0.246). Our results show that there is no consistent evidence of shorter telomeres in PD patients and suggest the importance of future studies on TL and PD that analyze other populations and also include assessment of TL from different brain regions.",

     "abstract": "Telomere length (TL) has been proposed as a biomarker of ageing, which might be used to identify individuals at higher risk of age-related diseases. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for several diseases. This study aims to analyse the associations of BMI with TL and the rate of TL change in older adults.Leukocyte TL (LTL) was measured by quantitative PCR in blood samples of 3600 older adults aged 50\u201375\u00a0years obtained at the baseline examination of a population-based cohort study in Germany. For longitudinal analyses, measurements were repeated in blood samples obtained at 8-year follow-up from 1000 participants. Multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate associations of BMI with LTL and changes in LTL over time.LTL was inversely associated with age (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.090, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). BMI and LTL associations varied according to age (p for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.021). BMI was significantly inversely associated with LTL in those younger than 60\u00a0years (\u2212\u00a06\u00a0base\u00a0pairs per 1\u00a0kg/m2 difference in BMI). In particular, weight gain during adulthood was inversely associated with LTL in a dose\u2013response manner in this age group, with those having gained \u2265\u00a030\u00a0kg having significantly shorter telomeres (\u2212\u00a0209\u00a0base\u00a0pairs) than those who maintained their weight. No clear patterns were observed between any of BMI-related variables and the rate of LTL change.Our cross-sectional analysis supports suggestions that weight gain during adulthood and obesity may contribute to shorter telomere length below 60\u00a0years of age, but this relationship could not be shown longitudinally.",

     "abstract": "Older adults are more fatigable than young during dynamic tasks, especially those that involve moderate to fast unconstrained velocity shortening contractions. Rate of torque development (RTD), rate of velocity development (RVD) and rate of neuromuscular activation are time-dependent neuromuscular parameters which have not been explored in relation to age-related differences in fatigability. The purpose was to determine whether these time-dependent measures affect the greater age-related fatigability in peak power during moderately fast and maximal effort shortening plantar flexions. Neuromuscular properties were recorded from 10 old (~\u00a078\u00a0years) and 10 young (~\u00a024\u00a0years) men during 50 maximal-effort unconstrained velocity shortening plantar flexions against a resistance equivalent to 20% maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque. At task termination, peak power, and angular velocity, and torque at peak power were decreased by 30, 18, and 16%, respectively, for the young (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and 46, 28, 30% for the old (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared to pre-fatigue values with the old exhibiting greater reductions across all measures (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Voluntary RVD and RTD decreased, respectively, by 24 and 26% in the young and by 47 and 40% in the old at task termination, with greater decrements in the old (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Rate of neuromuscular activation of the soleus decreased over time for both age groups (~\u00a047%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but for the medial gastrocnemius (MG) only the old experienced significant decrements (46%) by task termination. All parameters were correlated strongly with the fatigue-related reduction in peak power (r\u00a0=\u00a00.81\u20130.94, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), except for MG and soleus rates of neuromuscular activation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.25\u20130.30, p\u00a0>\u00a00.10). Fatigue-related declines in voluntary RTD and RVD were both moderately correlated with MG rate of neuromuscular activation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.51\u20130.52, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but exhibited a trend with soleus (r\u00a0=\u00a00.39\u20130.41, p\u00a0=\u00a00.07\u20130.09). Thus, time-dependent factors, RVD and RTD, are likely important indicators of intrinsic muscle properties leading to the greater age-related decline in peak power when performing a repetitive dynamic fatigue task, which may be due to greater fatigue-related central impairments for the older men than young.",

Aging mice induced by d-galactose (150\u00a0mg/kg, sc injection daily for 6\u00a0weeks) were chosen for the experiment. LSPCs (30, 60, and 90\u00a0mg/kg, ig) were provided after d-galactose injection. Learning and memory functions were detected by Y-maze and step-down avoidance tests. Then, some biochemical indexes related to cognitive ability and aging were measured. Histopathological feature and P53 protein expression in the hippocampus were observed. Results showed that the three different doses of LSPC could significantly ameliorate the learning and memory abilities impaired by d-galactose. LSPC significantly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide (i.e. 90\u00a0mg/kg LSPC group vs. model group, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008), reduced the content of \u03b2-amyloid peptide 1\u201342 (i.e. 90\u00a0mg/kg LSPC group vs. model group, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009), decreased the activities of acetylcholinesterase, monoamine oxidase B, total nitric oxide synthase (i.e. 90\u00a0mg/kg LSPC group vs. model group, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase and synchronously increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the brain. Furthermore, LSPC could prevent neuron damage and could lessen the expression of P53 protein in the hippocampus. These findings demonstrated that LSPC effectively attenuated cognitive damage and improved parameters related to brain aging in senescent mice induced by d-galactose, and may be used to treat Alzheimer's disease.",

Chronological age alone, though commonly used in prediction models of outcomes after CAB, does not alone reflect variability in aging process; thus, the risk of complications in older adults. We performed a prospective study to evaluate a relationship between senescence marker p16INK4a expression in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (p16 levels in PBTLs) with aging and with perioperative outcomes in older CAB patients. We included 55 patients age 55 and older, who underwent CAB in Johns Hopkins Hospital between September 1st, 2010 and March 25th, 2013. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data following outline of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons data collection form was collected, and p16 mRNA levels in PBTLs were measured using TaqMan\u00ae qRT-PCR. Associations between p16 mRNA levels in PBTLs with length of hospital stay, frailty status, p16 protein levels in the aortic and left internal mammary artery tissue, cerebral oxygen saturation, and augmentation index as a measure of vascular stiffness were measured using regression analyses. Length of hospital stay was the primary outcome of interest, and major organ morbidity, mortality, and discharge to a skilled nursing facility were secondary outcomes. In secondary analysis, we evaluated associations between p16 mRNA levels in PBTLs and interleukin-6 levels using regression analyses. Median age of enrolled patients was 63.5\u00a0years (range 56\u201381\u00a0years), they were predominantly male (74.55%), of Caucasian descent (85.45%). Median log2(p16 levels in PBTLs) were 4.71 (range 1.10\u20136.82). P16 levels in PBTLs were significantly associated with chronological age (mean difference 0.06 for each year increase in age, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.11) and interleukin 6 levels (mean difference 0.09 for each pg/ml increase in IL-6 levels, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.18). There were no significant associations with frailty status, augmentation index, cerebral oxygenation and p16 protein levels in blood vessels. Increasing p16 levels in PBTLs did not predict length of stay in the hospital (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87\u20131.40) or intensive care unit (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79\u20131.32). Additional evaluation of p16 levels in PBTLs as predictor of perioperative outcomes is required and should include additional markers of immune system aging as well as different outcomes after CAB in addition to length of hospital stay.",

All rats were sacrificed following a 4-month treatment period. Serum creatinine and blood lipid levels were measured. The glomerular sclerosis index and tubulointerstitial lesions were determined using renal periodic acid\u2013Schiff-stained paraffin sections. The mRNA and protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 and -2, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) were examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions and Western blots, respectively.Serum lipid (including serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides) levels in aged rats were significantly higher than those in young rats (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared to the aged control group, high-dose AVT was associated with significantly lower serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in aged rats (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); low-dose AVT was associated only with lower serum LDL-C levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Renal morphological changes in aged rats included focal glomerulosclerosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and arteriole sclerosis. Improved renal pathology was observed in aged, AVT-treated rats, and included a decreased glomerular sclerosis index and tubulointerstitial lesion score, especially in those receiving high-dose AVT. Additionally, renal artery wall thickening, luminal narrowing, and arteriolosclerosis were significantly less severe in aged rats receiving high-dose AVT. Upregulated expression of MMP-9 and TGF-\u03b21 was observed in the renal tissue of aged rats. AVT treatment was associated with a reversal of these phenomena and upregulated expression of TIMP-1, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b3 in aged rats.AVT improved the renal pathology of aged rats. These effects may have been induced by the lowering of blood lipids, maintaining the MMP/TIMP balance, and downregulating the expression of TGF-\u03b21. AVT may reduce the levels of MMP-9 and TGF-\u03b2 in aged rats by upregulating the expression of PPARs.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic VNS on endothelial impairments and the inflammatory profile in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (7\u20138\u00a0months old) were randomly assigned to the following four groups: sham-OVX, OVX, OVX\u00a0+\u00a0sham-VNS, and OVX\u00a0+\u00a0VNS. Throughout the experimental period, the OVX\u00a0+\u00a0VNS group received VNS for 3\u00a0h (20.0\u00a0Hz, 1.0\u00a0mA, and 10.00\u00a0ms pulse width) at the same time every other day. After 12\u00a0weeks of VNS, blood samples and thoracic aortas were collected for further analyses. Light microscopy and electron microscopy analyses showed that chronic VNS prevented endothelial swelling, desquamation and even necrosis in the OVX rats. In addition, it obviously improved endothelial function in the OVX rats by restoring the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (e-NOS) and serum endothelin-1 level. Increased expression of cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin) in the thoracic aortas and increases in the levels of circulating cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, MCP-1, and CINC/KC) were also observed in the OVX rats. Chronic VNS significantly restored these detrimental changes partly by increasing the ACh concentrations in vascular walls and blocking NF-\u03baB pathway activity. The results of this in vivo study have shown that the administration of chronic VNS during, in the early stage of estrogen deficiency, protects OVX rats from endothelial impairments and the inflammatory profile. These findings indicate that activation of the vagus nerve could be a promising supplemental therapy for reducing the risks of suffering from further CVDs in postmenopausal women.",

     "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus with its high morbidity and mortality becomes an important health problem. The multifactorial etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus is relative to many gene and molecule alterations, and increased insulin resistance. Besides these, however, there are still other predisposing and risk factors accounting for type 2 diabetes mellitus not to be identified and recognized. Emerging evidence indicated that defects in galanin function played a crucial role in development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Galanin homeostasis is tightly relative to insulin resistance and is regulated by blood glucose. Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinism, enhanced plasma galanin levels and decreased galanin receptor activities are some of the characters of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The discrepancy between high insulin level and low glucose handling is named as insulin resistance. Similarly, the discrepancy between high galanin level and low glucose handling may be denominated as galanin resistance too. In this review, the characteristic milestones of type 2 diabetes mellitus were condensed as two analogical conceptual models, obesity-hyper-insulin\u2013insulin resistance-type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity-hyper-galanin\u2013galanin resistance-type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both galanin resistance and insulin resistance are correlative with each other. Conceptualizing the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus as a disorder of galanin resistance may inspire a new concept to deepen our knowledge about pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, eventually leading to novel preventive and therapeutic interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

     "abstract": "Although age-related hypofunction of Leydig cells is well illustrated across species, its circadian nature has not been analyzed. Here we describe changes in circadian behavior in Leydig cells isolated from adult (3-month) and aged (18- and 24-month) rats. The results showed reduced circadian pattern of testosterone secretion in both groups of aged rats despite unchanged LH circadian secretion. Although arrhythmic, the expression of Insl3, another secretory product of Leydig cells, was decreased in both groups. Intracellular cAMP and most important steroidogenic genes (Star, Cyp11a1 and Cyp17a1), together with positive steroidogenic regulator (Nur77), showed preserved circadian rhythm in aging although rhythm robustness and expression level were attenuated in both aged groups. Aging compromised cholesterol mobilization and uptake by Leydig cells: the oscillatory transcription pattern of genes encoding HDL-receptor (Scarb1), hormone sensitive lipase (Lipe, enzyme that converts cholesterol esters from lipid droplets into free cholesterol) and protein responsible for forming the cholesterol esters (Soat2) were flattened in 24-month group. The majority of examined clock genes displayed circadian behavior in expression but only a few of them (Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3 and Rev-Erba) were reduced in 24-month-old group. Furthermore, aging reduced oscillatory expression pattern of Sirt1 and Nampt, genes encoding key enzymes that connect cellular metabolism and circadian network.

     "abstract": "For unknown reasons a woman's risk for developing Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) increases dramatically with age and/or loss of ovarian function. The MetS is characterized by hepatic insulin resistance (IR), which is strongly associated with intrahepatic lipid (IHL) accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Although circumstantial evidence suggests that the endocrine function of the ovary can directly impact hepatic mitochondrial function, this hypothesis remains untested. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the influence of age and secretory function of the ovary on mechanisms that regulate hepatic mitochondrial function.Adult (10\u00a0week-old) and aged (88\u00a0week-old) female C57BL/6 mice were separated into two groups to undergo bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) or control surgery (SHAM). Eight weeks after surgery hepatic tissue was removed for measurements of total IHL and fatty acid species within hepatic triglycerides, mitochondrial function, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.Hepatic IHL content was not affected by OVX, but was increased by age. OVX had no effect on mitochondrial respiration, however, hepatic mitochondria from aged mice had lower O2 consumption, lower complex IV and higher complex I content. Mitochondrial H2O2 production was highest in OVX groups and exacerbated by age, while mitochondrial lipid peroxidation was highest in the aged mice and exacerbated by OVX. Regardless of age, OVX resulted in lower mitochondrial content of antioxidant glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1). Isolated liver tissue from a sub-set of animals were acutely treated with conditioned ovarian media which increased Gpx1 mRNA expression compared to vehicle treated liver tissue.Ovarian secretory function is necessary for the maintenance of hepatic ROS buffering capacity in the mitochondria, while age significantly influences mitochondrial respiration. These data suggest that when age is coupled with loss of ovarian function there is an increased risk for developing hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction, which may influence the onset of metabolic disease. Thus, in females there is critical organ cross-talk occurring between hepatic tissue and the ovary that impacts hepatic mitochondrial function.",

Pooled samples from the different groups were subjected to proteomics and bioinformatics analysis to identify age-related changes in protein expression and associated pathways. We isolated 5072 proteins, and found that 67 proteins were downregulated and 109 proteins were upregulated in one or more groups during the aging process. Western blotting assays were performed to verify the proteomic results. Bioinformatic analysis identified proteins involved in neuronal degeneration, including proteins involved in neuronal firing, myelin sheath damage, and cell structure stability. We also observed the accumulation of extracellular matrix and lysosomal proteins which imply the occurrence of fibrosis and autophagy. Our results suggest a series of changes across a wide range of proteins in the human temporal lobe that may relate to aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders.",

BV2 microglia and primary microglia isolated from young adult and aged mice were treated with SFN and LPS. Changes in Nrf2 activity, expression of Nrf2 target genes, and levels of proinflammatory markers were assessed by quantitative PCR and immunoassay. SFN increased Nrf2 DNA-binding activity and upregulated Nrf2 target genes in BV2 microglia, while reducing LPS-induced interleukin (IL-)1\u03b2, IL-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

     "abstract": "A common manifestation of age-related bone loss and resultant osteoporosis are fractures of the hip. Age-related osteoporosis is thought to be determined by a number of intrinsic factors including genetics, hormonal changes, changes in levels of oxidative stress, or an inflammatory status associated with the aging process. The aim of this study was to investigate gene expression and bone architecture in bone samples derived from elderly osteoporotic women with hip fractures (OP) in comparison to bone samples from age matched women with osteoarthritis of the hip (OA). Femoral heads and adjacent neck tissue were collected from 10 women with low-trauma hip fractures (mean age 83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06) and consecutive surgical hip replacement. Ten bone samples from patients undergoing hip replacement due to osteoarthritis (mean age 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05) served as controls. One half of each bone sample was subjected to gene expression analysis. The second half of each bone sample was analyzed by microcomputed tomography. From each half, samples from four different regions, the central and subcortical region of the femoral head and neck, were analyzed. We could show a significantly decreased expression of the osteoblast related genes RUNX2, Osterix, Sclerostin, WNT10B, and Osteocalcin, a significantly increased ratio of RANKL to Osteoprotegerin, and a significantly increased expression of the enzymes superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase GPX3, and of the inflammatory cytokine IL6 in bone samples from hip fracture patients compared to controls. Major microstructural changes in OP bone were seen in the neck and were characterized by a significant decrease of bone volume, trabecular number, and connectivity density and a significant increase of trabecular separation. In conclusion, our data give evidence for a decreased expression of osteoblast related genes and increased expression of osteoclast related genes. Furthermore, increased expression of SOD2 and GPX3 suggest increased antioxidative activity in bone samples from elderly osteoporotic women with hip fractures.",

Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was measured as an index of arterial stiffness. Cerebrovascular reactivity was determined by measuring changes in mean blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery under normocapnic, hypocapnic and hypercapnic conditions. Mean baPWV was greater (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in older compared with young adults. At baseline, mean cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebrovascular conductance index were lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in older compared with young adults under normocapnic, hypocapnic and hypercapnic conditions. There were no significant group differences in cerebrovascular reactivity when they were adjusted for stimuli (i.e., end-tidal CO2 concentrations) in most perturbation conditions except for the normocapnia to hypercapnia condition. baPWV was negatively associated with cerebrovascular conductance index at all conditions (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

     "abstract": "When humans voluntarily activate a muscle, intracortical inhibition decreases. Such a decrease also occurs in the presence of a postural challenge and more so with increasing age. Here, we examined age-related changes in motor cortical activity during postural and non-postural contractions with varying levels of postural challenge. Fourteen young (age 22) and twelve old adults (age 70) performed three conditions: (1) voluntary contraction of the soleus muscle in sitting and (2) leaning forward while standing with and (3) without being supported. Subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the soleus motor area suppressing ongoing EMG, as an index of motor cortical activity. The area of EMG suppression was ~\u00a060% smaller (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in unsupported vs. supported leaning and sitting, with no difference between these latter two conditions (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Even though in absolute terms young compared with old adults leaned farther (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018), there was no age effect or an age by condition interaction in EMG suppression. Leaning closer to the maximum without support correlated with less EMG suppression (rho\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.44, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034). We conclude that the critical factor in modulating motor cortical activity was postural challenge and not contraction aim or posture. Age did not affect the motor control strategy as quantified by the modulation of motor cortical activity, but the modulation appeared at a lower task difficulty with increasing age.",

Whether the effects are beneficial or detrimental to vascular function appear to be dependent on the integrity of the vascular endothelium and whether the responses are short-term or chronic. Acute modulation of MR activation has resulted in conflicting outcomes on vascular function in young healthy adults. Little is known about the vascular role of aldosterone and MR activation in healthy human aging. The primary objective of this study was to examine whether acute inhibition of MR by the selective antagonist eplerenone, influences vascular function in healthy older adults. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 22 adults (61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE, 53\u201379\u00a0years) who were free from overt clinical cardiovascular disease. We measured brachial artery flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation and endothelium-independent dilation to sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4\u00a0mg) following eplerenone (100\u00a0mg/dose, 2 doses, 24\u00a0h between doses) or placebo. In response to acute MR antagonism, flow-mediated dilation decreased by 19% (from 6.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 to 5.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02; placebo vs. eplerenone). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity also decreased following MR antagonism based on the ratio of phosphorylated eNOSSer1177 to total eNOS (1.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 vs. 1.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

Despite old age and frailty being associated with extensive and long-term utilization of acetaminophen and a high prevalence of adverse drug reactions, there is limited information on the risks of toxicity from acetaminophen in old age and frailty. This study aimed to assess changes in the risk and mechanisms of hepatotoxicity from acute, chronic and sub-acute acetaminophen exposure with old age and frailty in mice. Young and old male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to either acute (300\u00a0mg/kg via oral gavage), chronic (100\u00a0mg/kg/day in diet for six weeks) or sub-acute (250\u00a0mg/kg, t.i.d., for three days) acetaminophen, or saline control. Pre-dosing mice were scored for the mouse clinical frailty index, and after dosing serum and liver tissue were collected for assessment of toxicity and mechanisms. There were no differences with old age or frailty in the degree of hepatotoxicity induced by acute, chronic or subacute acetaminophen exposure as assessed by serum liver enzymes and histology. Age-related changes in the acetaminophen toxicity pathways included increased liver GSH concentrations, increased NQO1 activity and an increased pro- and anti-inflammatory response to acetaminophen in old age. Frailty-related changes included a negative correlation between frailty index and serum protein, albumin and ALP concentrations for some mouse groups. In conclusion, although there were changes in some pathways that would be expected to influence susceptibility to acetaminophen toxicity, there was no overall increase in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity with old age or frailty in mice.",

Moreover, in the past decade, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have been increasingly utilized in clinical practice. Both cognitive and CSF markers can be used to differentiate between AD patients and healthy seniors with high diagnostic accuracy. However, the extent to which performance on specific mnemonic or executive tasks enables reliable estimations of the concentrations of different CSF markers and their ratios remains unclear.To address the above issues, we examined the association between neuropsychological data and CSF biomarkers in 51 AD patients using hierarchical multiple regression analyses. In the first step of these analyses, age, education and sex were entered as predictors to control for possible confounding effects. In the second step, data from a neuropsychological test battery assessing episodic memory, semantic memory and executive functioning were included to determine whether these variables significantly increased (compared to step 1) the explained variance in A\u03b242 concentration, p-tau concentration, t-tau concentration, A\u03b242/t-tau ratio, and A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio.The different models explained 52% of the variance in A\u03b242/t-tau ratio, 27% of the variance in A\u03b242 concentration, and 28% of the variance in t-tau concentration. In particular, A\u03b242/t-tau ratio was associated with verbal recognition and code shifting, with A\u03b242 being related to verbal recognition and t-tau being related to code shifting. By contrast, the inclusion of neuropsychological data did not allow reliable estimations of A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio or p-tau concentration.Our results showed that strong associations exist between the cognitive key symptoms of AD and the concentrations and ratios of specific CSF markers. In addition, we revealed a specific combination of neuropsychological tests that may facilitate reliable estimations of CSF concentrations, thereby providing important diagnostic information for non-invasive early AD detection.",

In addition, the translocation of some isoforms of NFkB from cytosol to nuclei (NFkBp65, p50, p52) and ATP level content was studied. In addition we investigated the effect of the chronic administration of growth hormone (GH) on these age-related parameters.

Our results supported the relation of NFkB activation with enhanced apoptosis and pro-inflammatory status in old SAMP8 mice and suggested a selective beneficial effect of the GH treatment, which was able to partially reduce the incidence of some deleterious changes in the heart of those mice.",

     "abstract": "Cellular senescence has been proposed to play critical roles in tumor suppression and organismal aging, but the molecular mechanism of senescence remains incompletely understood. Here we report that a putative lysosomal carbohydrate efflux transporter, Spinster, induces cellular senescence in human primary fibroblasts. Administration of d-galactose synergistically enhanced Spinster-induced senescence and this synergism required the transporter activity of Spinster. Intracellular d-galactose is metabolized to galactose-1-phosphate by galactokinase. Galactokinase-deficient fibroblasts, which accumulate intracellular d-galactose, displayed increased baseline senescence. Senescence of galactokinase-deficient fibroblasts was further enhanced by d-galactose administration and was diminished by restoration of wild-type galactokinase expression. Silencing galactokinase in normal fibroblasts also induced senescence. These results suggest a role for intracellular galactose in the induction of cellular senescence.",

The combined effect of aging and chronic inflammation on mitochondrial degradation by autophagy is understudied. In interleukin 10 null mouse (IL-10tm/tm), a rodent model of chronic inflammation, we studied the effects of aging and inflammation on mitochondrial clearance. We show that aging in IL-10tm/tm is associated with reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial death signaling and altered formation of autophagosomes, compared to age-matched C57BL/6 controls. Moreover, skeletal muscles of old IL-10tm/tm mice have the highest levels of damaged mitochondria with disrupted mitochondrial ultrastructure and autophagosomes compared to all other groups. These observations highlight the interface between chronic inflammation and aging on altered mitochondrial biology in skeletal muscles.",

     "abstract": "Aging is a long-standing problem that people are always interested in. Thus, it is critical to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms in aging and explore the most efficient method to extend life expectancy. To achieve this goal, a wide range of systems including cells, rodent models, budding yeast, worms and flies have been employed for decades. In recent years, the effect of dietary restriction (DR) on lifespan is in the prime focus. Although we have confirmed that reduced insulin and/or insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling can increase Drosophila lifespan; the precise molecular mechanisms and nutritional response landscape of diet-mediated aging is ambiguous. Epigenetic events have been considered as the major contributors to lifespan extension with response to DR. The role of DNA methylation in aging is well acknowledged in mammals and rodents where it has been shown to impact aging by regulating the transcription, though the mechanism of regulation is not limited to only transcription. In Drosophila, the contribution of methylation during DR in aging is definitely less explored. In this review, we will update the advances in mechanisms of DR, with a particular focus on methylation as an upcoming target for aging studies and discuss Drosophila as a powerful model to understand mechanisms of aging with response to diet.",

In a previous study, we reported that a new generation of Leydig cells can be restored in both young and old rat testes after a single injection of ethane dimethanesulfonate (EDS), and that the abilities of the new Leydig cells in young and old rats to produce T were equivalent. Our objective herein was to compare the steroidogenic fate of the new Leydig cells over time. Young (3\u00a0month-old) and old (18\u00a0month-old) rats were injected with EDS to eliminate the existing Leydig cells. Ten weeks after EDS, Leydig cells had been restored and T production by the new Leydig cells isolated from young and old rat testes was equivalent. Thirty weeks after EDS treatment of young rats, the ability of the new Leydig cells to produce T had not diminished from 10\u00a0weeks post-EDS. In contrast, at 30\u00a0weeks post-EDS, T production by new cells in old rat testes was reduced significantly from the 10-week level. Serum T levels at 10 and 30\u00a0weeks were consistent with Leydig cell T production. Serum LH levels did not differ in any group. Thus, although the Leydig cells restored to both young and old rats after EDS initially produced T at high, equivalent levels, the cells in the old testes did not maintain this ability. These results suggest that: 1) the cells from which new populations of Leydig cells are derived may differ depending upon the age of the rat; and/or 2) factors extrinsic to the new Leydig cells in young and old testes differ, and it is these differences that are responsible for reductions in T by the newly formed Leydig cells in the testes of old rats.",

There were sex differences in peak RTD (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), with greater RTD in men, but no group by sex interaction effects for any variables. The lower RTD in OA versus controls was not explained by variation between groups in the fiber type admixture of the muscle, and was mitigated when RTD was normalized to peak torque (PT). In knee OA volunteers, we found strong correlations between the RTD expressed relative to PT and the velocity of contraction of single myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIA/X muscle fibers (r\u00a0=\u00a00.652 and 0.862; both P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and power output of MHC I fibers (r\u00a0=\u00a00.642; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Here I examine life history data recently analyzed by Le Bourg and Moreau (2014) and show that non-linearity in the cohort trajectory of fecundity is largely explained by heterogeneity in the duration of reproductive life spans. A model specifying linear post-peak decline of fecundity in individual flies provides a better fit to the data than one that combines linear decline with late-life fecundity plateaus. Using repeated measures analysis of variance, I show that age-dependent trends in individual fecundity are mostly linear, while among the most longevous individuals up to 20% of the variation in trends is non-linear. Plateaus in individual trajectories might be explained by evolutionary processes or by random environmental variation. The dominant role of environmental variation is supported by several observations, including the high variability of late-life fecundity, the occurrence of occasional individual plateaus in inbred lines, and the observation of plateaus in only a fraction of the population. Plateau and non-plateau flies identified by Le Bourg and Moreau (2014) have, on average, the same total fecundity and the same fecundity trajectories. The available evidence suggests that the environmental variance for late-life fecundity is sufficiently large to produce occasional individual trajectories that resemble plateaus but are not heritable.",

There is no comprehensive, cellular and tissue-level, pathophysiological theory.

There has been relatively little research about melatonin in delirium, and there has been no such study done in the group of elderly patients of a general medicine ward yet.The aim of our study was to compare melatonin hormone concentration in relation to the presence of delirium in elderly patients hospitalized in the general medicine ward.Blood samples were collected four times a day for two days (at 12:00, 18:00, 00:00 and 6:00), on the day when delirium was diagnosed and 72\u00a0h after the delirium resolution. Delirium was diagnosed with the Confusion Assessment Method and the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Revision.The mean age of 30 patients (73.3% women) was 86.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0years. Delirium was diagnosed most often on the second and third day of hospitalization. A lot of predisposing and precipitating factors for delirium were identified.

In this work, with the objective of identifying signatures of age-related progressive change at the transcriptomic level, we have performed a whole-genome gene expression analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes in a group of healthy individuals with ages ranging from 14 to 93\u00a0years. A set of genes with progressively changing gene expression (either increase or decrease with age) has been identified and contextualized in a coexpression network. A modularity analysis has been performed on this network and biological-term and pathway enrichment analyses have been used for biological interpretation of each module.In summary, the results of the present work reveal the existence of a transcriptomic component that shows progressive expression changes associated to age in peripheral blood leukocytes, highlighting both the dynamic nature of the process and the need to complement young vs. elder studies with longitudinal studies that include middle aged individuals. From the transcriptional point of view, immunosenescence seems to be occurring from a relatively early age, at least from the late 20s/early 30s, and the 49\u201356\u00a0year old age-range appears to be critical. In general, the genes that, according to our results, show progressive expression changes with aging are involved in pathogenic/cellular processes that have classically been linked to aging in humans: cancer, immune processes and cellular growth vs. maintenance.",

We aimed to examine the associations between objectively measured breaks in sedentary time with ADL impairments and physical independence. Cross-sectional assessments were carried out in 371 participants (131 male) aged 65\u2013103\u00a0years from the Portuguese surveillance system of physical activity. Physical activity (PA) and sedentary time (ST) were assessed with accelerometry, and ADL impairments and physical independence with the self-reported 12-item composite physical function scale. Using ROC analyses a cut-off of 7 hourly breaks in sedentary time was identified which maximized the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing physical dependence. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that, independently of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), participants performing \u2264\u00a07 hourly breaks in sedentary time had 2 to 7 fold increased odds for impairment in 10 of the 12 ADL. When stratifying ADL into basic, instrumental and advanced ADL we verified that less than 7 hourly breaks in sedentary time was associated with a 2 to 5 fold increased odds for impairments and physical dependence, independent of MVPA. No associations were observed between meeting PA guidelines and basic, instrumental, and advanced ADL impairment although time in MVPA was lower in participants showing impairments. In conclusion, the frequency of breaks in sedentary time in older ages is independently associated with lower risk for ADL impairments and physical dependence. Our findings support interventions to encourage older adults to increase overall PA by interrupting sedentary time.",

     "abstract": "To expand the understanding of aging in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, global quantification of metabolite and protein levels in young and aged nematodes was performed using mass spectrometry. With age, there was a decreased abundance of proteins functioning in transcription termination, mRNA degradation, mRNA stability, protein synthesis, and proteasomal function. Furthermore, there was altered S-adenosyl methionine metabolism as well as a decreased abundance of the S-adenosyl methionine synthetase (SAMS-1) protein. Other aging-related changes included alterations in free fatty acid levels and composition, decreased levels of ribosomal proteins, decreased levels of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1), a shift in the cellular redox state, an increase in sorbitol content, alterations in free amino acid levels, and indications of altered muscle function and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2\u00a0+ homeostasis. There were also decreases in pyrimidine and purine metabolite levels, most markedly nitrogenous bases. Supplementing the culture medium with cytidine (a pyrimidine nucleoside) or hypoxanthine (a purine base) increased lifespan slightly, suggesting that aging-induced alterations in ribonucleotide metabolism affect lifespan. An age-related increase in body size, lipotoxicity from ectopic yolk lipoprotein accumulation, a decline in NAD+ levels, and mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction may explain many of these changes. In addition, dietary restriction in aged worms resulting from sarcopenia of the pharyngeal pump likely decreases the abundance of SAMS-1, possibly leading to decreased phosphatidylcholine levels, larger lipid droplets, and ER and mitochondrial stress. The complementary use of proteomics and metabolomics yielded unique insights into the molecular processes altered with age in C. elegans.",

Memantine is a low-affinity voltage-dependent noncompetitive antagonist at glutamatergic NMDA receptors. Here, we investigated whether memantine protects against glutamate-induced senescence. In PC12 cells, treatment with glutamate induced senescent phenotypes as judged by the cell appearance and senescence-associated \u00df-galactosidase (SA-\u00dfgal) in parallel with decreased SIRT1 and increased p53 expression. However, treatment with memantine decreased glutamate-induced senescent PC12 cells and reversed the changes in SIRT1 and p53 expression. Glutamate is known to stimulate the production of NO and O2\u2212 and has the capacity to generate ONOO\u2212 in the CNS. Therefore, we investigated whether glutamate activates nNOS and memantine reverses it. Treatment with glutamate increased nNOS expression, activity, and production of NO, whereas memantine blocked them. Next, the in vivo effects of memantine on cognitive function in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8), as a model of AD, were investigated. In the Morris water maze test, SAMP8 showed a marked decline in performance, but memantine administration improved it. Moreover, neuronal senescence and the level of oxidative stress in the hippocampus were decreased by memantine. Finally, the effects of combination treatment with memantine and donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, were investigated. We observed additive effects of memantine and donepezil on the senescent phenotype of PC12 cells and the hippocampus of SAMP8. These results indicate that inhibition of the NMDA receptor by memantine leads to a decrease in nNOS activity and results in a reduction of glutamate-induced senescence. Thus, our present study suggests a critical role of memantine in the prevention of neuronal aging, and supports that donepezil has a combined effect with memantine.",

     "abstract": "Age, gender and systemic diseases all influence cardiac function and remodelling. In cats, age and gender associated myocardial remodelling and the effect of systemic diseases on the myocardium have so far not been studied. The aim of the study was therefore to investigate whether relevant cytokines and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling enzymes are expressed in the myocardium of cats with non-cardiac diseases and whether transcription levels are influenced by age and gender.The study was performed on myocardial samples from 26 cats aged between 2 and 19\u00a0years that had died with non-cardiac diseases. Seventeen cats were female (2 entire) and nine were male (1 entire). Of these, nine cats were diagnosed with diseases unlikely to affect the myocardium (control cats). The remaining 17 cats suffered from diseases with likely systemic effects. All hearts were assessed for any pathological changes, and the myocardium was analysed for interleukin (IL)-1, -2, -4, -6, -18, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -3, -13, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1, -2 and -3 transcriptions using quantitative RT-PCR assays.Despite the absence of any histological evidence of myocardial damage, inflammation and fibrosis, the myocardium of all the cats was found to constitutively transcribe cytokines and ECM remodelling enzymes, with generally higher mRNA concentrations in the atria than in the ventricles. The young and male cats exhibited higher transcription levels throughout the myocardium in comparison to the older and female cats. Furthermore, age-associated transcription pattern differed between male and female cats.The constitutive transcription of ECM remodelling enzymes suggests continuous myocardial remodelling throughout the entire life of a cat. The myocardium of young and male cats appears to be in a pro-inflammatory state, whereas in older and female cats the myocardium exhibits a reduced inflammatory reaction to systemic disease. Age-associated cardiac remodelling seems to be influenced by non-hormonal factors in male and female cats.",

     "abstract": "Recovery from contraction-induced injury is impaired with aging. At a young age, the secondary response several days following contraction-induced injury consists of edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and segmental muscle fiber degeneration to aid in the clearance of damaged tissue and repair. This morphological response has not been wholly established at advanced age. Our aim was to characterize muscle fiber morphology 3 and 10\u00a0days following stretch-shortening contractions (SSCs) varying in repetition number (i.e. 0, 30, 80, and 150) for young and old rats. For muscles of young rats, muscle fiber degeneration was overt at 3\u00a0days exclusively after 80 or 150 SSCs and returned significantly closer to control values by 10\u00a0days. For muscles of old rats, no such responses were observed. Transcriptional microarray analysis at 3\u00a0days demonstrated that muscles of young rats differentially expressed up to 2144 genes while muscles of old rats differentially expressed 47 genes. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that cellular movement was a major biological process over-represented with genes that were significantly altered by SSCs especially for young rats. Protein levels in muscle for various cytokines and chemokines, key inflammatory factors for cell movement, increased 3- to 50-fold following high-repetition SSCs for young rats with no change for old rats. This age-related differential response was insightful given that for control (i.e. 0 SSCs) conditions, protein levels of circulatory cytokines/chemokines were increased with age. The results demonstrate ongoing systemic low-grade inflammatory signaling and subsequent desensitization of the cytokine/chemokine and morphological response to contraction-induced injury with aging \u2014 features which accompany age-related impairment in muscle recovery.",

Emerging evidence proposes a link between immune changes and pain, which is consistent with the inflammation theory of aging and the increased incidence of age-related diseases. This study tested the hypothesis that older adults show greater immune responses to experimental pain compared to younger individuals. Study subjects (8 younger and 9 older healthy adults) underwent 3 experimental sessions using well-validated human experimental pain models: the cold pressor task (CPT), focal heat pain (FHP), and a non-painful thermal control. Blood was collected through an indwelling catheter at baseline and 3, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90\u00a0min post-stimuli administration. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 IL-6 and IL-8) peaked at the same time points for both groups, with greater elevations among older subjects for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 in both pain models and elevations in IL-6 only for CPT. Anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) generally peaked later for the older subjects, with increased elevations for FHP but not the CPT. These data are consistent with the assertion that age-related immune system dysregulation may account for the increased prevalence of pain in older adults.",

Both are present in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who have a very high cardiovascular risk. We investigated whether CKD duration is associated with relative telomere length (RTL) in 4802 patients from the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study. We measured RTL in each sample in quadruplicates using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We observed a U-shaped association of RTL with CKD duration: the longest RTL was found in those 339 patients who reported the shortest disease duration (<\u00a06\u00a0months) and shorter RTL in 2108 patients with duration between 6\u00a0months and less than 5\u00a0years. Most importantly, those 2331 patients who reported a CKD duration of 5\u00a0years and more had significantly longer RTL compared to those with intermediate CKD duration (6\u00a0months to less than 5\u00a0years): mean 0.954, 95%CI 0.946\u20130.961 versus 0.937, 95%CI 0.929\u20130.944, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study these surprising results have to be considered with caution and as hypothesis-generating. Whether the longer RTL in patients with long-lasting disease is caused by an activation of telomerase to counteract the shortening of RTL due to oxidative stress and inflammation or whether they are caused by a survival bias needs to be investigated in longitudinal studies. Our data are in support of a higher plasticity of shortening and elongations of RTL as until recently anticipated.",

Recent studies suggest ameliorating effects of vitamin D on metabolic and oxidative stress in the liver tissue in an experimental model of DM. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and 1\u03b1-hydroxylase, the key enzyme for the production of active vitamin D form (calcitriol) in the liver during long-term diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) in aging rats. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of liver expression of 1\u03b1-hydroxylase and VDRs during aging in long-term streptozotocin-induced DM1. 1\u03b1-Hydroxylase was identified in the monocyte/macrophage system of the liver. In addition to the nuclear expression, we also observed the expression of VDR in membranes of lipid droplets within hepatocytes. Aging and long-term DM1 resulted in significant increases in the number of 1\u03b1-hydroxylase immunoreactive cells, as well as the percentage of strongly positive VDR hepatocytes. In conclusion, the liver has the capacity for active vitamin D synthesis in its monocyte/macrophage system that is substantially increased in aging and long-term diabetes mellitus. These conditions are also characterized by significant increases in vitamin D receptor expression in hepatocytes. The present study suggests that VDR signaling system could be a potential target in prevention of liver complications caused by diabetes and aging.",

The phospholipid profile of adult flies developed under larval crowding contained a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, lower proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids, and greater risk of peroxidation. There was also a negative correlation between the peroxidation index (PI) and longevity. The longevity-selected females showed a lower PI compared with control lines under both densities.

We hypothesize that disrupting BDNF/TrkB signaling in early old age will reveal a period of susceptibility evident by morphological changes at neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). Adult, male TrkBF616A mice (n\u00a0=\u00a025) at 6 and 18\u00a0months of age, were used to examine the structural properties of diaphragm muscle NMJs (n\u00a0=\u00a01097). Confocal microscopy was used to compare pre- and post-synaptic morphology and denervation following a 7\u00a0day treatment with the phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 derivative 1NMPP1, which inhibits TrkB kinase activity in TrkBF616A mice vs. vehicle treatment. In early old age (18\u00a0months), presynaptic terminal volume decreased compared to 6\u00a0month old diaphragm NMJs (~\u00a020%). Inhibition of TrkB kinase activity significantly decreased the presynaptic terminal volume (~\u00a020%) and motor end-plate 2D planar area (~\u00a010%), independent of age group. Inhibition of TrkB kinase activity in early old age significantly reduced overlap of pre- and post-synaptic structures and increased the proportion of denervated NMJs (to ~\u00a020%).

Mice lacking the helicase domain of this protein exhibit metabolic abnormalities that are reversed by vitamin C. In this study, we used a targeted metabolomic approach to identify serum metabolites significantly altered in young mutant mice treated with or without vitamin C. We also measured several serum inflammatory and cardiometabolic factors. We show that young mutant mice exhibit an increase in serum hydroxyproline and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), markers of cardiovascular diseases and inflammation, before they exhibit morphological anomalies in different tissues. We also observed an increase in three very long chain lysophosphatidylcholines underlying peroxisome perturbation. Vitamin C reversed the concentrations of these metabolites and PAI-1 to wild type values. Transcriptomic analyses on the liver of mutant mice revealed a decrease in the expression of genes involved in fatty acid degradation compared to wild type animals. Vitamin C treatment increased the expression of genes involved in glutathione metabolism and the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in these mice. These results show that changes at the transcriptomic level concord with the alterations of several serum metabolites in these mice. Finally, we found that a mislocalization of the Wrn mutant protein in the liver endoplasmic reticulum fraction increased oxidative stress in that cellular compartment. Vitamin C reversed this oxidative stress. To conclude, this study provides novel potential predictive cardiometabolic biomarkers in WS that will allow the assessment of the impact of vitamin C on patients with WS.",

Young adult HRLF rats showed enhanced radial bone growth (e.g., increased trabecular bone volume, osteoblast numbers, bone formation rate, and mid-diaphyseal periosteal perimeter), compared to age-matched controls. Mature HRLF rats showed several indices of radial bone loss (e.g., decreased trabecular bone volume, and increased cortical bone thinning, porosity, resorptive spaces and woven bone formation), increased osteoclast numbers and inflammatory cytokines, compared to age-matched controls and young adult HRLF rats. Mature rats weighed more yet had lower maximum reflexive grip strength, than young adult rats, although each age group was able to pull at the required reach rate (4\u00a0reaches/min) and required submaximal pulling force (30\u00a0force-grams) for a food reward. Serum estrogen levels and flexor digitorum muscle size were similar in each age group.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic galantamine treatment on cognitive performance, A\u03b2 deposition and astrocyte activation in the transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Galantamine (5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) or 0.9% saline was administrated twice daily for eight weeks in 10-month-old APP/PS1 mice. In addition a separate group of 10-month old male C57BL/6 wild type mice was included as a reference control. Compared with saline treated APP/PS1 mice, galantamine treated mice exhibited significantly improved escape latencies on Days 6 and 7 of testing (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and significantly decreased numbers of platform crossings (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) as assessed in the Morris water maze. Galantamine reduced the total area of amyloid load within the hippocampus of transgenic APP/PS1 mice, inhibited astrocyte activation as assessed by immunohistochemistry and decreased intracellular TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression as determined by immunofluorescence. Galantamine failed to alter hippocampal levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 as assayed by ELISA. Galantamine may be involved in modifying AD pathophysiological mechanisms by alleviating A\u03b2 deposition and neuroinflammation. The results from this study provide new evidence for use of galantamine in the treatment of AD.",

In this study, we investigate the effect of intermittent bout and single bout exercise training on inflammatory molecules in young (3\u00a0months) and old (22\u00a0months) male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. The rats were divided into 6 groups. Young and old rats were randomly assigned for control and two exercise training groups, single bout (S type): 30\u00a0min/day, 5\u00a0days/week for 6\u00a0weeks and intermittent bout (I type): three times for 10\u00a0min/day, 5\u00a0days/week for 6\u00a0weeks respectively. The exercise training was carried out by a treadmill at a speed of 15\u00a0m/min (young) or 10\u00a0m/min (old) with a slope of 5\u00b0. After 48\u00a0h of the final exercise bout, muscle samples were collected for biochemical assay. I type exercise training reduced the serum levels of inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in old rats. By contrast, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were elevated. Consequently in skeletal muscles, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were decreased significantly in the old group of I type. However, the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) level had no positive effects. Also, phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) and myogenic differentiation (MyoD) were increased markedly in S and I types of old rats. These results suggest that I type exercise training appears more effective to reduce age-associated inflammatory molecules, and may recommend in regulating against chronic complicated disease induced by aging.",

This study investigated whether leucine supplementation in old rats could improve muscle regenerative capacity. Young and old male Wistar rats were supplemented with leucine; then, the muscles were cryolesioned and examined after 3 and 10\u00a0days. Leucine supplementation attenuated the decrease in the expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in young and old muscles on day 3 post-injury and promoted an increase in the cross-sectional area of regenerating myofibers from both young and old soleus muscles on day 10 post-injury. This supplementation decreased the levels of ubiquitinated proteins and increased the proteasome activity in young regenerating muscles, but the opposite effect was observed in old regenerating muscles. Moreover, leucine decreased the inflammation area and induced an increase in the number of proliferating satellite cells in both young and old muscles. Our results suggest that leucine supplementation improves the regeneration of skeletal muscles from old rats, through the preservation of certain biological responses upon leucine supplementation. Such responses comprise the decrease in the inflammation area, increase in the number of proliferating satellite cells and size of regenerating myofibers, combined with the modulation of components of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt-protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome system.",

Therefore, we examined the activity of neurons of the AVPV and measure the noradrenaline (NE) of acyclic rats, in constant estrus, and compared it with that of cyclic rats in estrus. Female cyclic (4\u20135\u00a0months) and acyclic (17\u201318\u00a0months) rats were euthanized at 10, 14, and 18\u00a0h in estrus. Brains were processed for immunoreactivity to antigens related to Fos (FRA) in AVPV, and the NE was determined by HPLC-ED. Plasma concentrations of LH, FSH, E2 and P4 were determined. In the acyclic animals, plasma LH was higher but the FSH was lower. There was decreasing P4 at different times, while the E2 was constant and lower in acyclic rats. FRA-ir expression in AVPV neurons of acyclic rats as well as turnover of NE was higher when compared with cyclic group. The preliminary findings showed increased activity in AVPV neurons in aging contribute to changes in the temporal pattern of neuroendocrine signaling, compromising the accuracy of inhibitory and stimulatory effects, causing irregularity in the estrous cycle and determining reproductive senescence.",

It has recently been shown that aging is associated with profound changes in DNAm. Several of these methylation changes take place in a clock-like fashion, i.e. correlating with the calendar age of an individual. Thus, the epigenetic clock based on these kind of DNAm changes could provide a new biomarker for human aging process, i.e. being able to separate the calendar and biological age. Information about the correlation of the time indicated by this clock to the various aspects of immunosenescence is still missing. As chronic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is probably one of the major driving forces of immunosenescence, we now have analyzed the correlation of CMV seropositivity with the epigenetic age in the Vitality 90\u00a0+ cohort 1920 (122 nonagenarians and 21 young controls, CMV seropositivity rates 95% and 57%, respectively). The data showed that CMV seropositivity was associated with a higher epigenetic age in both of these age groups (median 26.5 vs. 24.0 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.02, Mann\u2013Whitney U-test) in the young controls and 76.0 vs. 70.0 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the nonagenarians).

     "abstract": "Aging evolved because the strength of natural selection declines over the lifetime of most organisms. Weak natural selection late in life allows the accumulation of deleterious mutations and may favor alleles that have positive effects on fitness early in life, but costly pleiotropic effects expressed later on. While this decline in natural selection is central to longstanding evolutionary explanations for aging, a role for sexual selection and sexual conflict in the evolution of lifespan and aging has only been identified recently. Testing how sexual selection and sexual conflict affect lifespan and aging is challenging as it requires quantifying male age-dependent reproductive success. This is difficult in the invertebrate model organisms traditionally used in aging research. Research using crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), where reproductive investment can be easily measured in both sexes, has offered exciting and novel insights into how sexual selection and sexual conflict affect the evolution of aging, both in the laboratory and in the wild. Here we discuss how sexual selection and sexual conflict can be integrated alongside evolutionary and mechanistic theories of aging using crickets as a model. We then highlight the potential for research using crickets to further advance our understanding of lifespan and aging.",

The domestic dog unsurprisingly fits each criterion mentioned. The dog has already become a key model system in which to evaluate surgical techniques and novel medications because of the remarkable similarity between human and canine conditions, treatments, and response to therapy. The dog naturally serves as a disease model for study, obviating the need to construct artificial genetically modified examples of disease. Just as the dog offers a natural model for human conditions and diseases, simple observation leads to the conclusion that the canine aging phenotype also mimics that of the human. Genotype information, biochemical information pertaining to the GH/IGF-1 pathway, and some limited longitudinal investigations have begun the establishment of the domestic dog as a model of aging. Although we find that dogs indeed are a model to study aging and there are many independent pieces of canine aging data, there are many more \u201copen\u201d areas, ripe for investigation.",

     "publication date": "11-2015",
     "abstract": "Long-lived mutants of model organisms have brought remarkable progress in our understanding of aging mechanisms. However, long-lived mutants are usually maintained in optimal standardized laboratory environments (SLEs), and it is not obvious to what extent insights from long-lived mutants in SLEs can be generalized to more natural environments. To address this question, we reviewed experiments that compared the fitness and lifespan advantage of long-lived mutants relative to wild type controls in SLEs and more challenging environments in various model organisms such as yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the mouse Mus musculus. In competition experiments over multiple generations, the long-lived mutants had a lower fitness relative to wild type controls, and this disadvantage was the clearest when the environment included natural challenges such as limited food (N\u00a0=\u00a06 studies). It is well known that most long-lived mutants have impaired reproduction, which provides one reason for the fitness disadvantage. However, based on 12 experiments, we found that the lifespan advantage of long-lived mutants is diminished in more challenging environments, often to the extent that the wild type controls outlive the long-lived mutants. Thus, it appears that information on aging mechanisms obtained from long-lived mutants in SLEs may be specific to such environments, because those same mechanisms do not extend lifespan in more natural environments. This suggests that different mechanisms cause variation in aging and lifespan in SLEs compared to natural populations.",

     "abstract": "Research on the physiological causes of senescence aim to identify common physiological mechanisms that explain age-related declines in fitness across taxonomic groups. Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences found on the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Past research indicates that telomere attrition is strongly correlated with inter-specific rates of aging, though these studies cannot distinguish whether telomere attrition is a cause or consequence of the aging process. We extend previous research on this topic by incorporating recent studies to test the hypothesis that telomeres shorten more slowly with age in slow-aging animals than in fast-aging ones. We assembled all studies that have quantified cross-sectional (i.e. between-individual) telomere rates of change (TROC) over the lifespans of wild animals. This included 22 estimates reflecting absolute TROC (TROCabs, bp/yr, primarily measured using the terminal restriction fragment length method), and 10 estimates reflecting relative TROC (TROCrel, relative telomere length/yr, measured using qPCR), from five classes (Aves, Mammalia, Bivalvia, Reptilia, and Actinopterygii). In 14 bird species, we correlated between-individual (i.e. cross-sectional) TROCabs estimates with both maximum lifespan and a phylogenetically-corrected principle component axis (pcPC1) that reflected the slow-fast axis of life-history variation. Bird species characterized by faster life-histories and shorter maximum lifespans had faster TROCabs. In nine studies, both between-individual and within-individual TROC estimates were available (n\u00a0=\u00a08 for TROCabs, n\u00a0=\u00a01 for TROCrel). Within-individual TROC estimates were generally greater than between-individual TROC estimates, which is indicative of selective disappearance of individuals with shorter telomeres. However, the difference between within- and between-individual TROC estimates was only significant in two out of nine studies. The relationship between within-individual TROCabs and maximum lifespan did not differ from the relationship of between-individual TROCabs and maximum lifespan. Overall, our results provide additional support for the hypothesis that TROC is correlated with inter-specific rates of aging and complement the intra-specific research that also find relationships between telomere attrition and components of fitness.",

We collected from the literature data on tooth wear in the wild (measured as the slope of the regression of log-transformed M1 crown height on age), longevity (measured as the age at which 90% of individuals are dead) and two metrics of actuarial senescence in captive populations (rate of senescence between 6 and 12\u00a0years of age and Gompertz rate of senescence). Between-species differences and variation in tooth height accounted for most of the observed variation in tooth wear among large herbivores: tooth height and tooth wear were positively correlated. In contrast, tooth wear was little influenced by sex, body mass, or taxonomy. No marked between-sex differences in longevity occurred. Males senesced faster than females when tooth wear was low (for both senescence metrics), while between-sex differences in actuarial senescence when tooth wear was high depended on the metric used to measure actuarial senescence. While longevity was mostly independent of the intensity of tooth wear, we found general support for a positive relationship between both measures of actuarial senescence and tooth wear. These patterns were consistent whether hypsodonty was controlled for or not. Although varying according to sex and to the metric used for assessing actuarial senescence, our findings suggest overall that tooth wear could be positively associated with actuarial senescence among large herbivores. Further longitudinal studies focusing on changes within individuals will be required to test whether a mechanistic link between tooth wear and actuarial senescence occurs in large herbivores.",

     "abstract": "The degree to which changes in lifespan are coupled to changes in senescence in different physiological systems and phenotypic traits is a central question in biogerontology. It is underpinned by deeper biological questions about whether or not senescence is a synchronised process, or whether levels of synchrony depend on species or environmental context. Understanding how natural selection shapes patterns of synchrony in senescence across physiological systems and phenotypic traits demands the longitudinal study of many phenotypes under natural conditions. Here, we examine the patterns of age-related variation in late adulthood in a wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) that have been the subject of individual-based monitoring for thirty years. We examined twenty different phenotypic traits in both males and females, encompassing vital rates (survival and fecundity), maternal reproductive performance (offspring birth weight, birth date and survival), male rutting behaviour, home range measures, parasite burdens, and body mass. We initially quantified age-related variation in each trait having controlled for annual variation in the environment, among-individual variation and selective disappearance effects. We then standardised our age-specific trait means and tested whether age trajectories could be meaningfully grouped according to sex or the type of trait. Whilst most traits showed age-related declines in later life, we found striking levels of asynchrony both within and between the sexes. Of particular note, female fecundity and reproductive performance declined with age, but male annual reproductive success did not. We also discovered that whilst home range size and quality decline with age in females, home range size increases with age in males. Our findings highlight the complexity of phenotypic ageing under natural conditions and, along with emerging data from other wild populations and laboratory models, suggest that the long-standing hypothesis within evolutionary biology that fitness-related traits should senesce in a synchronous manner is seriously flawed.",

Long-term longitudinal studies on wild animals are extremely well-suited to studying the impact of environmental and individual characteristics (and the interaction between the two) on senescence, and can help us to understand the mechanisms that shape the evolution of senescence. In this review, we summarize and discuss the insights gained from our comprehensive long-term individual-based study of the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis). This species provides an excellent model system in which to investigate the evolution of senescence in the wild. We found that Seychelles warblers show senescent declines in survival and reproduction, and discuss how individual characteristics (body condition, body size) and environmental effects (low- versus high-quality environments) may affect the onset and rate of senescence. Further, we highlight the evidence for trade-offs between early-life investment and senescence. We describe how key cellular and physiological processes (oxidative stress and telomere shortening) underpinning senescence are affected by individual and environmental characteristics in the Seychelles warbler (e.g. food availability, reproductive investment, disease) and we discuss how such physiological variation may mediate the relationship between environmental characteristics and senescence.

     "abstract": "Free-living organisms are exposed to a wide range of stressors, all of which can disrupt components of stress-related and detoxification physiology. The subsequent accumulation of somatic damage is widely believed to play a major role in the evolution of senescence. Organisms have evolved sophisticated physiological regulatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis in response to environmental perturbations, but these systems are likely to be constrained in their ability to optimise robustness to multiple stressors due to functional correlations among related traits. While evolutionary change can accelerate due to human ecological impacts, it remains to be understood how exposure to multiple environmental stressors could affect senescence rates and subsequently population dynamics and fitness. We used a theoretical evolutionary framework to quantify the potential consequences for the evolution of actuarial senescence in response to exposure to simultaneous physiological stressors \u2013 one versus multiple and additive versus synergistic \u2013 in a hypothetical population of avian \u201curban adapters\u201d. In a model in which multiple stressors have additive effects on physiology, species may retain greater capacity to recover, or respond adaptively, to environmental challenges. However, in the presence of high synergy, physiological dysregulation suddenly occurs, leading to a rapid increase in age-dependent mortality and subsequent population collapse. Our results suggest that, if the synergistic model is correct, population crashes in environmentally-stressed species could happen quickly and with little warning, as physiological thresholds of stress resistance are overcome.",

     "abstract": "Human lifespan has risen dramatically over the last 150\u00a0years, leading to a significant increase in the fraction of aged people in the population. Until recently it was believed that this contrasted strongly with the situation in wild populations of animals, where the likelihood of encountering demonstrably senescent individuals was believed to be negligible. Over the recent years, however, a series of field studies has appeared that shows ageing can also be observed for many species in the wild. We discuss here the relevance of this finding for the different evolutionary theories of ageing, since it has been claimed that ageing in the wild is incompatible with the so-called non-adaptive (non-programmed) theories, i.e. those in which ageing is presumed not to offer a direct selection benefit. We show that a certain proportion of aged individuals in the population is fully compatible with the antagonistic pleiotropy and the disposable soma theories, while it is difficult to reconcile with the mutation accumulation theory. We also quantify the costs of ageing using life history data from recent field studies and a range of possible metrics. We discuss the merits and problems of the different metrics and also introduce a new metric, yearly death toll, that aims directly at quantifying the deaths caused by the ageing process.",

     "abstract": "Molecular studies of aging aim to unravel the cause(s) of aging bottom-up, but linking these mechanisms to organismal level processes remains a challenge. We propose that complementary top-down data-directed modelling of organismal level empirical findings may contribute to developing these links. To this end, we explore the heuristic value of redundancy models of aging to develop a deeper insight into the mechanisms causing variation in senescence and lifespan. We start by showing (i) how different redundancy model parameters affect projected aging and mortality, and (ii) how variation in redundancy model parameters relates to variation in parameters of the Gompertz equation. Lifestyle changes or medical interventions during life can modify mortality rate, and we investigate (iii) how interventions that change specific redundancy parameters within the model affect subsequent mortality and actuarial senescence. Lastly, as an example of data-directed modelling and the insights that can be gained from this, (iv) we fit a redundancy model to mortality patterns observed by Mair et al. (2003; Science 301: 1731\u20131733) in Drosophila that were subjected to dietary restriction and temperature manipulations. Mair et al. found that dietary restriction instantaneously reduced mortality rate without affecting aging, while temperature manipulations had more transient effects on mortality rate and did affect aging. We show that after adjusting model parameters the redundancy model describes both effects well, and a comparison of the parameter values yields a deeper insight in the mechanisms causing these contrasting effects. We see replacement of the redundancy model parameters by more detailed sub-models of these parameters as a next step in linking demographic patterns to underlying molecular mechanisms.",

Here we study the atypical localization of the egg-yolk protein vitellogenin (Vg) in the brain of the honey bee. Vg is known to influence honey bee social regulation and aging rate. Our findings suggest that Vg immunoreactivity in the brain is specifically localized within the class of non-neuronal glial cells.

     "abstract": "Due to the extreme variation in life spans among species, using a comparative approach to address fundamental questions about the aging process has much to offer. For example, maximum life span can vary by as much as several orders of magnitude among taxa. In recent years, using primary cell lines cultured from species with disparate life spans and aging rates has gained considerable momentum as a means to dissect the mechanisms underlying the variation in aging rates among animals. In this review, we reiterate the strengths of comparative cellular biogerontology, as well as provide a survey of the current state of the field. By and large this work sprang from early studies using cell lines derived from long-lived mutant mice. Specifically, they suggested that an enhanced resistance to cellular stress was strongly associated with increased longevity of select laboratory models. Since then, we and others have shown that the degree of stress resistance and species longevity is also correlated among cell lines derived from free-living populations of both mammals and birds, and more recent studies have begun to reveal the biochemical and physiological underpinnings to these differences. The continued study of cultured cell lines from vertebrates with disparate life spans is likely to provide considerable insight toward unifying mechanisms of longevity assurance.",

     "abstract": "Ageing is characterized by a progressive deterioration of multiple physiological and molecular pathways, which impair organismal performance and increase risks of death with advancing age. Hence, ageing studies must identify physiological and molecular pathways that show signs of age-related deterioration, and test their association with the risk of death and longevity. This approach necessitates longitudinal sampling of the same individuals, and therefore requires a minimally invasive sampling technique that provides access to the larger spectrum of physiological and molecular pathways that are putatively associated with ageing. The present paper underlines the interest in using red blood cells (RBCs) as a promising target for longitudinal studies of ageing in vertebrates. RBCs provide valuable information on the following six pathways: cell maintenance and turnover (RBC number, size, and heterogeneity), glucose homeostasis (RBC glycated haemoglobin), oxidative stress parameters, membrane composition and integrity, mitochondrial functioning, and telomere dynamics. The last two pathways are specific to RBCs of non-mammalian species, which possess a nucleus and functional mitochondria. We present the current knowledge about RBCs and age-dependent changes in these pathways in non-model and wild species that are especially suitable to address questions related to ageing using longitudinal studies. We discuss how the different pathways relate with survival and lifespan and give information on their genetic and environmental determinants to appraise their evolutionary potential.",

Yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of mitochondrial genotypes and phenotypes across diverse animal models, particularly in species that have extremely labile physiology. Here, we measure mitochondrial genome-types and transcription in ecotypes of garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) that are adapted to disparate habitats and have diverged in aging rates and lifespans despite residing in close proximity. Using two RNA-seq datasets, we (1) reconstruct the garter snake mitochondrial genome sequence and bioinformatically identify regulatory elements, (2) test for divergence of mitochondrial gene expression between the ecotypes and in response to heat stress, and (3) test for sequence divergence in mitochondrial protein-coding regions in these slow-aging (SA) and fast-aging (FA) naturally occurring ecotypes. At the nucleotide sequence level, we confirmed two (duplicated) mitochondrial control regions one of which contains a glucocorticoid response element (GRE). Gene expression of protein-coding genes was higher in FA snakes relative to SA snakes for most genes, but was neither affected by heat stress nor an interaction between heat stress and ecotype. SA and FA ecotypes had unique mitochondrial haplotypes with amino acid substitutions in both CYTB and ND5. The CYTB amino acid change (Isoleucine\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Threonine) was highly segregated between ecotypes. This divergence of mitochondrial haplotypes between SA and FA snakes contrasts with nuclear gene-flow estimates, but correlates with previously reported divergence in mitochondrial function (mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ATP production, and reactive oxygen species consequences).",

     "abstract": "Frailty has been identified as a promising condition for distinguishing different degrees of vulnerability among older persons. Several operational definitions have proposed fatigue as one of the features characterizing the frailty syndrome. However, such a subjective symptom is still not yet sufficiently explored and understood.Fatigue is a common and distressing self-reported symptom perceived by the person while performing usual mental and physical activities, highly prevalent in older people, and strongly associated with negative health-related events. The understanding of fatigue is hampered by several issues, including the difficulty at objectively operationalizing, the controversial estimates of its prevalence, and the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying its manifestation. Despite such barriers, the study of fatigue is important and might be encouraged. Fatigue may be the marker of the depletion of the body's homeostatic reserves to a threshold leading to its psycho-physical functional impairment, mirroring the concept of frailty. Its subjective and symptomatic nature resembles that of other conditions (e.g., pain, depression), which equally affect the individual's quality of life, expose to negative outcomes, and severely burden healthcare expenditures.In the present paper, we present an overview of the current knowledge on fatigue in older persons in order to increase awareness about its clinical and research relevance. Future research on this topic should be encouraged and developed because it could potentially lead to novel interventions against this symptom as well as against frailty and age-related conditions.",

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess supraspinal fatigue (an increase in the superimposed twitch, SIT) and the peak rate of muscle relaxation. Time to failure was briefer for the men than the women (6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 vs. 9.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5\u00a0min, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) with no difference between young and old adults (7.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 vs. 8.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0min, respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a00.45) and no interaction (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).

Supraspinal fatigue increased for all groups and was associated with the time to failure (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Regression analysis however, indicated that the time to failure was best predicted by the peak relaxation rate (baseline values and slowing with fatigability) (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.55). Rate-limiting contractile mechanisms (e.g. excitation\u2013contraction coupling) were responsible for the increased fatigability of the elbow flexors of men compared with women for a dynamic fatiguing task of slow angular velocity, and this sex difference was maintained with aging.

Participants were old adults, aged\u00a0\u2265\u00a060\u00a0years (61 women and 34 men) who were all capable of performing basic daily activities by themselves and lived on their own. To describe physical activity we used objective data measured by accelerometers which record active and sedentary periods during everyday life for five days. Determination of oxidative stress was conducted from three perspectives: determination plasma total antioxidant status (TAS), plasma antioxidant enzyme activities, i.e., glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and membrane lipid peroxidation (TBARS). In the group of women, those who met physical activity recommendations (WR) had lower level of TAS. In addition, the moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was negatively correlated with TAS. Simultaneously, MVPA was correlated with increase in the GPx antioxidant enzyme activity, and the counts per minute were positively correlated with CAT activity. In the group of men, the cpm and the MVPA were negatively correlated with lipid peroxidation while lifestyle physical activity was positively correlated with CAT activity.These findings suggest that MVPA in the elderly although it is related to a decrease in the TAS in women, induces adaptive increase in antioxidant enzyme activity and decreases lipid peroxidation in both women and men. These results suggest that at this time of life, it is not only the amount of physical activity performed that is important but also its intensity.",

OAB has been extensively studied in healthy subjects. However, to our knowledge, no article has been published on elder adults suffering from Alzheimer Disease (AD).

Participants performed an age estimation task followed by a face recognition task. Indeed, for each photograph, subjects were asked to say if the face looked young or old and to give a yes/no judgment of familiarity (after an encoding phase). Participants also completed a questionnaire assessing their frequency of contact with young and old adults.Although estimates of sensitivity indicated no age bias in AD patients, when memory bias was corrected according to their performance we found evidence in favor of an OAB in this group. Both healthy groups presented an OAB, in particular when the corrected memory bias was considered. However, no significant correlations were found between their frequency of contact with young/older people and the number of correctly identified faces, false alarms, sensitivity and corrected memory bias. Therefore, although AD patients present a deficit in face-memory, they still present memory bias towards same-age group faces when their difficulties in face memory are controlled.",

Linear regression confirmed the significant impact of age on these NMR parameters whereas physical activity impact was not systematic.NMR imaging provided a comprehensive assessment of the aging process impact on skeletal muscle composition. Water T2 increase might be related to changes in fiber typology while increased T2 heterogeneities might correlate with some degree of tissue disorganization, like the development of interstitial fibrosis. Fat fraction and water T2 heterogeneity increase was partly slowed down by physical activity. These changes were not gender dependent.",

     "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) to prevent the accumulation of proteins in an aberrant conformation. The UPR can restore homeostasis by upregulating ER chaperones, such as glucose-regulated protein 78\u00a0kD (GRP78), to refold the incorrectly handled protein, and by degrading the misfolded proteins via the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome and autophagy\u2013lysosome system. ER stress was recently demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases. In this study, we measured the expression levels of GRP78 and ubiquitinated proteins in the cochleae of young C57BL/6 mice and aged mice to assess the capacity of the UPR. The lower expression of GRP78 and the increased number of ubiquitinated proteins observed in the cochleae of aged mice suggested that the capacity of the UPR was impaired and that the cell death pathway was activated. We found a markedly increased expression of the ER-related pro-apoptotic factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in the cochleae of aged mice, whereas the level of cleaved caspase-12 did not differ between the two groups. In addition, the cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 was significantly increased in the aged cochleae, suggesting the activation of apoptosis in the cochleae resulting from the cross-talk between the ER and mitochondria through CHOP. These results indicated that impaired UPR in the cochleae of aged C57BL/6 mice resulting in ER stress may lead to apoptosis that is dependent on the mitochondrial pathway and that ER stress induced apoptosis may not be mediated by caspase-12.",

     "abstract": "Physical function and strength decline with age and lead to limited mobility and independence in older adults. Alterations in mitochondrial function are thought to underlie numerous age-related changes, including declining physical ability. Recent studies suggest that systemic changes in bioenergetic capacity may be reported by analyzing mitochondrial function in circulating cells. The objective of this study was to determine whether the bioenergetic capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is related to differences in physical function among older, overweight/obese, adults. To address this, we tested the hypothesis that greater PBMC respirometric capacity would be associated with better physical function, muscular strength, leg lean mass, and muscle quality. Furthermore, we tested whether the respirometric capacity of PBMCs is related to cellular composition and inflammatory status reported by interleukin-6 (IL-6).Fasted PBMC respiration (pmol/min/500,000 cells), expanded short physical performance battery (Ex-SPPB), peak knee extensor (KE) strength (Nm), grip strength (kg), leg lean mass (kg, via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]), muscle quality (Nm/kg), and plasma IL-6 (pg/mL) were analyzed in 15 well-functioning, community-dwelling, sedentary overweight/obese older men (n\u00a0=\u00a09) and women (n\u00a0=\u00a06) aged 65 to 78 (mean 68.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0years). Pearson and partial correlations were calculated to determine associations between PBMC respiration and these variables.Higher maximal respiration of PBMCs was associated with better Ex-SPPB (r\u00a0=\u00a00.58, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), greater KE strength (r\u00a0=\u00a00.60, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), greater grip strength (r\u00a0=\u00a00.52, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and lower IL-6 (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.58, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Higher spare respiratory capacity was associated with better Ex-SPPB (r\u00a0=\u00a00.59, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), greater KE strength (r\u00a0=\u00a00.60, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), greater grip strength (r\u00a0=\u00a00.54, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), greater leg muscle quality (r\u00a0=\u00a00.56, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), and lower IL-6 (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.55, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Monocyte and lymphocyte counts were not related to PBMC respiratory capacity.Our results indicate that respirometric profiles of readily obtainable blood cells are associated with physical function and strength.

Postmenopausal osteopenic women were randomly allocated (1:1) into creatine (n\u00a0=\u00a056; 1\u00a0g/d) or placebo group (n\u00a0=\u00a053; dextrose at same dose). At baseline and after one year of intervention, we assessed parameters of bone health, body composition, and muscle function. Blood parameters were also assessed before and after the intervention and adverse events were recorded throughout the trial. Possible differences in dietary intake were assessed by three 24-h dietary recalls.Bone mineral density at lumbar spine, femoral neck, total femur, and whole body did not differ within- or between-groups. No significant changes in body weight, BMI, absolute and relative body fat, and body lean mass were observed. Muscle function, as assessed by timed-up-and-go and timed-stands tests, were not significantly changed within- or between-groups. Safety laboratory parameters remained unaltered.A one-year low-dose creatine supplementation (1\u00a0g/d) was free of adverse effects, but did not affect bone health parameters, lean mass, or muscle function in older women.

The participants were randomly divided into the four following groups: Resistance Group (RG; n\u00a0=\u00a020), involved in high intensity strength training; Cardiovascular Group (CVG; n\u00a0=\u00a020), involved in high intensity cardiovascular training; Postural Group (PG; n\u00a0=\u00a020) involved in low intensity training, based on postural and balance exercises; and Control Group (CG; n\u00a0=\u00a020). Exercises were performed over the course of 12\u00a0weeks. All participants were tested for their cognitive functions pre- and post-intervention using the following neurocognitive tests: the Attentive Matrices Test, Raven's Progressive Matrices, Stroop Color and Word Interference Test, Trail Making Test and Drawing Copy Test. Statistical analysis showed that the CVG group improved significantly in the Attentive Matrices Test and Raven's Progressive Matrices (both p\u00a0=\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas the RG group improved in Drawing Copy Test time (p\u00a0=\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Cardiovascular training is effective in improving performance attentive and analytic tasks, whereas resistance training is effective in improving praxis.

Twelve older adults (6 men, mean age, 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0years) and twelve young adults (6 men, mean age, 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0years) were studied. MU properties of the tibialis anterior (TA) and vastus medialis (VM) muscles were determined electrophysiologically using decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered averaging (DE-STA). Motor unit number estimates (MUNEs) of the TA were significantly reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in older adults (102\u00a0\u00b1\u00a076) compared to young adults (234\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0109), primarily as a result of significantly larger surface-detected motor unit potentials (S-MUPs) in older adults (63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029\u00a0\u03bcV) compared to young adults (27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014\u00a0\u03bcV).

Maximal isometric strength was significantly larger in both the TA and knee extensors of young adults (TA: 0.56\u00a0Nm/kg, KE: 2.2\u00a0Nm/kg) compared to old (TA: 0.4\u00a0Nm/kg, KE: 1.3\u00a0Nm/kg). Similar reductions in peak muscle power were observed between young (TA: 33\u00a0W, KE: 357\u00a0W) and old adults (TA: 26\u00a0W, KE: 224\u00a0W). The greatest deficit between young and old subjects in peak power output occurred at 20% MVC for the TA and 40% MVC for the knee extensors. Results from this study indicate that there are changes in MU properties with age, and that this effect may be greater in the more distal TA muscle. Further, this study demonstrates that muscle power may be a sensitive marker of changes in neuromuscular function with aging.",

The negative relationship between wave reflection and lean mass (LM) has been inconsistent. We investigated the impact of age and LM on aortic hemodynamic responses to metaboreflex activation in post-menopausal women. Post-menopausal women, younger and older (n\u00a0=\u00a020 per group) than 60\u00a0years, performed 2-min isometric handgrip at 30% of maximal force followed by 3-min post-exercise muscle ischemia (PEMI). We measured carotid\u2013femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and femoral-ankle PWV (faPWV) at rest, and aortic systolic blood pressure (aSBP), pulse pressure (aPP), AP, AIx, and AIx-adjusted for heart rate (AIx@75) at rest and during PEMI using tonometry. Arm and leg LM were measured by DEXA. Resting cfPWV, aSBP, and aPP were higher, while AIx@75 and leg LM were lower in older than younger women. aSBP and aPP increased similarly during PEMI in both groups. Increases in AP (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), AIx (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and AIx@75 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) during PEMI were greater in older than younger women. From these responses, only AP during PEMI was correlated (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) positively with aSBP and aPP responses, and negatively with leg LM. Resting faPWV, but not cfPWV, was correlated (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) with AP, aSBP, and aPP during PEMI. Therefore, PEMI induces greater wave reflection responses in older than younger post-menopausal women.

Biceps (antagonist muscle) & Triceps (agonist muscle) Brachii activation time by sEMG in 60 young (26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0years) and 64 older (80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0years) community-dwelling subjects during a simple point-to-point RT-test (moving a finger using standardized elbow-extension from one pushbutton to another following a visual stimulus). RT was divided in pre-movement-time (PMT, time for stimulus processing) and movement-time (MT, time for motor response completion). Muscle activation time 1) following stimulus onset (PMAT) and 2) before movement onset (MAT) was calculated. PMAT for both muscles was significantly longer for the older subjects compared to the young (258\u00a0\u00b1\u00a053\u00a0ms versus 224\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037\u00a0ms, p\u00a0=\u00a00.042 for Biceps and 280\u00a0\u00b1\u00a070\u00a0ms versus 218\u00a0\u00b1\u00a043\u00a0ms for Triceps, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

In addition, data for humans is extremely rare in this area. Here we present the first shotgun lipidomics analysis of mitochondrial membranes and the peroxidation index of skeletal muscle, liver, and brain in three mammals that span the range of mammalian longevity. The species compared were mice (MLS of 4\u00a0years), pigs (MLS of 27\u00a0years), and humans (MLS of 122\u00a0years). Mouse mitochondria contained highly unsaturated PUFA in all phospholipid classes. Human mitochondria had lower PUFA content and a lower degree of unsaturation of PUFA. Pig mitochondria shared characteristics of both mice and humans. We found that membrane susceptibility to peroxidation was primarily determined by a limited number of phospholipid molecules that differed between both tissues and species.",

The younger drivers generally demonstrated 15.6\u00b0 greater functional ROM (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), were nearly twice as successful in target detection due to target location (p\u00a0=\u00a0.008), and had 0.46\u00a0s less target detection time (p\u00a0=\u00a0.016) than the older drivers.Assessing older driver functional ROM may provide more comprehensive assessment of driving ability than neck ROM. Target detection success and time to detection may also be part of the aging process as these measures differed between driver groups.",

A major challenge in the treatment of elderly patients with chronically elevated blood glucose is the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. Molecular mechanisms of hypoglycemia remain unclear, but are associated with premature onset of age-related-diseases. Here we report a mitochondrial metabolic profile assessing short-term (up to six hours) and longer-term (12\u201324\u00a0h) durations of low-glucose stress. We observed that the anti-diabetic biguanide and mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, metformin, can lower and restore the elevated oxygen consumption rate during shorter-term glucose stress to levels similar to that of cells cultured in normal glucose. This effect appears, in part, to involve activation of the 5\u2032 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).",

Previously, we demonstrated that exercise-induced reduction of collagen I in the aging heart was linked to a suppression of oxidative stress and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u00df). The renin\u2013angiotensin II system (RAS) increases oxidative stress via NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2) and thus elevates TGF-\u00df and collagen accumulation. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that exercise training would alleviate age-related upregulation of the angiotensin II receptor I (AT1R) and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2), concomitant with suppression of TGF-\u03b2 and fibrosis. Young (3\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a020) and old (31\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a020) Fischer 344\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Brown Norway F1 (FBNF1) hybrid rats were assigned into sedentary and exercise groups, with exercise training rats training on a treadmill 45\u00a0min/day, 5\u00a0days/week for the next 12\u00a0weeks. Exercise training mitigated age-related upregulation of AT1R, Nox2 activity, and Nox2 subunits gp91phox and p47phox. Exercise training also attenuated TGF-\u00df positive staining and downstream effectors of fibrosis in the aging heart: connective tissue growth factor, phosphorylation of Smad2 at Ser423, myofibroblast proliferation, and collagen I-positive staining. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise training protects against age-dependent cardiac fibrosis by suppressing AT1R and Nox2 as part of a RAS\u2013Nox2\u2013TGF-\u03b2 pathway.",

     "abstract": "Muscle- and liver-derived IGF-1 play important roles in muscle anabolism throughout growth and aging. Yet, prolonged food restriction is thought to increase longevity in part by lowering levels of IGF-1, which in turn reduces the risk for developing various cancers. The dietary factors that modulate IGF-1 levels are, however, poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that the adipokine leptin, which is elevated with food intake and suppressed during fasting, is a key mediator of IGF-1 levels with aging and food restriction. First, leptin levels in peripheral tissues were measured in young mice fed ad libitum, aged mice fed ad libitum, and aged calorie-restricted (CR) mice. A group of aged CR mice were also treated with recombinant leptin for 10\u00a0days. Later, aged mice fed ad libitum were treated with saline (VEH) or with a novel leptin receptor antagonist peptide (Allo-aca) and tissue-specific levels of IGF-1 were determined. On one hand, recombinant leptin induced a three-fold increase in liver-derived IGF-1 and a two-fold increase in muscle-derived IGF-1 in aged, CR mice. Leptin also significantly increased serum growth hormone levels in the aged, CR mice. On the other, the leptin receptor antagonist Allo-aca did not alter body weight or muscle mass in treated mice compared to VEH mice. Allo-aca did, however, produce a significant (20%) decline in liver-derived IGF-1 as well as an even more pronounced (>\u00a050%) decrease in muscle-derived IGF-1 compared to VEH-treated mice. The reduced IGF-1 levels in Allo-aca treated mice were not accompanied by any significant change in growth hormone levels compared to VEH mice. These findings suggest that leptin receptor antagonists may represent novel therapeutic agents for attenuating IGF-1 signaling associated with aging, and could potentially mimic some of the positive effects of calorie restriction on longevity.",

Various dietary restriction regimens have been shown to extend healthy lifespan in a variety of species. However, identification of alternative approaches that could be more acceptable to humans is actively being pursued. We have shown previously that mice deficient in pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) have an extended healthy lifespan on a regular chow diet. In this study, we determined the lifespan of PAPP-A knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) littermates fed a high fat diet (HFD) starting at 12\u00a0months of age. PAPP-A KO and WT mice had equivalent weight gain as measured over 25\u00a0weeks on HFD. However, PAPP-A KO mice on HFD had a significant increase in lifespan (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Body composition and tissue pathology were assessed in a separate cohort of mice after 30\u00a0weeks on HFD. Percent body fat was equivalent in the two groups. However, there was a decrease in visceral fat depot weights and an increase in serum adiponectin levels in PAPP-A KO compared to WT mice. Major pathological differences were seen in kidney, heart and testes, with PAPP-A KO mice having little, if any, evidence of inflammation, mineralization, or degeneration in these tissues compared to WT mice. Thus, PAPP-A is a novel drug target with the potential to promote healthy longevity without a need for dietary restriction.",

In addition, current data indicate an increase in DM cases in the population between 40 and 59\u00a0years of age. Diabetes is associated with the development of micro- and macro-vascular complications, derived from chronic hyperglycemia on the endothelium. Some reports demonstrate that people in a prediabetic state have a major risk of developing early endothelial dysfunction (ED). Today, it is accepted that individuals considered as prediabetic patients are in a pro-inflammatory state associated with endothelial and mitochondrial dysfunction. It is important to mention that impaired mitochondrial functionality has been linked to endothelial apoptosis and release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in patients with sepsis, cardiac disease, or atherosclerosis. This free mtDNA could promote ED, as well as other side effects on the vascular system through the activation of the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). TLR9 is expressed in different cell types (e.g., T or B lymphocytes, mastocytes, and epithelial and endothelial cells). It is localized intracellularly and recognizes non-methylated dinucleotides of viral, bacterial, and mitochondrial DNA. Recently, it has been reported that TLR9 is associated with the pathogenesis of lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diabetes. In this work, it is hypothesized that the increase in the levels of circulating mtDNA is the trigger of early ED in the prediabetic patient, and later on in the older patient with diabetes, through activation of the TLR9 present in the endothelium.",

     "abstract": "Predation is an important selection pressure which shapes aging patterns in natural populations, and it is also a significant factor in the life history decisions of individuals. Exposure to the perceived threat of size-dependent fish predation has been shown to trigger adaptive responses in animal life history including an increase in early reproductive output. In water fleas, this response to perceived predation risk appears to have a cost, as a lifespan in an environment free of predation cues is 20% longer. The aim of this study is to establish the biodemographic basis of phenotypic differences in the water flea lifespan which are induced by the cues of fish predation. We examined mortality by fitting the Gompertz\u2013Makeham model of mortality to large cohorts of two cladoceran species, Daphnia longispina and Diaphanosoma brachyurum. Our findings indicate that perceived exposure to the threat of fish predation (induced through chemical cues) only accelerated the rate of aging in Diaphanosoma, and not in Daphnia where the treatment led to an earlier onset of aging. The second of these two phenotypic responses is consistent with the genetically based differences between Daphnia from habitats that differ with respect to predation risk. In contrast, the response of Diaphanosoma demonstrates that the cue of extrinsic mortality\u2014in this case, fish predation\u2014is a key factor in shaping these cladoceran life histories in the wild, and is one of the few interventions which has been shown to induce a plastic change in the rate of aging.",

Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which fat is accumulated in the liver during aging remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we investigated potential alterations that might contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis with aging. To this end, we analyzed the expression and the subcellular localization of key transcriptional factors involved in lipid metabolism such as ChREBP, Foxo1, Foxa2 and SREBP-1c in the liver of 3- and 24-month old Wistar rats. In addition, we studied the intracellular redistribution of ChREBP in response to fasting/refeeding transition. Old rats were characterized by hepatic steatosis, low serum ketone body levels and postprandial hyperinsulinemia. These observations were paralleled by the cytoplasmic localization and decreased expression of Foxa2, while ChREBP expression was markedly up-regulated and mainly localized in the nucleus. Consequently, the expression of lipogenic and \u03b2-oxidation genes was up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively. Besides, the intracellular redistribution of ChREBP in response to fasting/refeeding transition was also impaired in old animals. Additionally, a negative correlation between serum ketone body levels and the nuclear localization of ChREBP was observed only in adult but not in old rats. Taken together, these data suggest that an age-related dysfunctional adaptation of ChREBP, in response to changes in the nutritional state, might contribute to the development of liver steatosis with aging.",

All subjects followed an isoenergetic, protein-controlled diet for 6\u00a0days preceding the clamp. The net protein anabolic response to hyperinsulinemia was similarly blunted in obese (0.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06) and obese type 2 diabetic women (0.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04) compared to healthy women (0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00b7kg fat free mass\u2212\u00a01\u00b7min\u2212\u00a01; ANOVA p\u00a0=\u00a00.018).

Endogenous glucose production was not completely suppressed during the clamp only in diabetic women. Thus, the glucose infusion rate was the lowest in this group. Obese elderly women with and without type 2 diabetes have a similar degree of insulin resistance of protein anabolism, despite worse glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes. Similar to previous findings in middle-aged women, obesity exerted a blunting effect on protein anabolism, which may contribute to the development of sarcopenic obesity.

The present study was set to explore age-related SBDP120 formation and its relevance to AD-type hallmark lesions in the human brains.

In cultured rat retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5), SBDP120 elevation occurred with caspase-3 activation following oxygen as well as serum deprivation, suggestive of SBDP120 formation in stressful conditions with and without apparent neuronal death. These results confirm an age-related intraneuronal SBDP120 accumulation in the human cerebrum that is enhanced in AD.

Kaplan\u2013Meier, Cox proportional hazards and CART analyses determined the overall prognostic value of these markers for predicting all-cause, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality as well as hospitalization.Serum IL-6 and usCRP levels were strongly associated with time of survival, independent of cause of death. Serum IL-6 levels had the most robust dose\u2013response relationship with mortality. To a lesser extent, IL-10 and IL-1\u03b2 were associated with all-cause mortality but were restricted to non-cardiovascular or cardiovascular mortality, respectively. Having a low IL-6 at baseline (<\u00a01.77\u00a0pg/ml) could predict 90% of those who were not at risk for all-cause mortality after 3\u00a0years, even after adjusting for confounders. Similarly, we observed an 83.6% chance of identifying those cases with 0 or 1 hospitalization using low IL-6 serum levels.The results suggest that a single measurement of low IL-6 serum levels is the first choice to guide clinical practice in the oldest old and could summarize the short-term risk of death and hospitalization.",

     "abstract": "Frail older people are at high risk for fractures and falls increasing the rates of institutionalization and mortality. Bone markers have been related to both aging and fractures. However, no previous reports have shown a potential relationship between serum bone markers such as N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (\u03b2-CTX) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) with frailty in elderly female populations. This study is aimed at examining the associations of bone metabolism markers and frailty in older Spanish women through a descriptive cross-sectional analysis based on a cohort of the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA). The levels of serum PINP, \u03b2-CTX, PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were assessed in 592 participants (median age 74\u00a0years) who were defined as robust, prefrail and frail according to Fried's approach. Frail subjects had significantly high levels of PINP, \u03b2-CTX and PTH and low production of 25(OH)D. After adjustment for confounders, high PINP levels (defined by the upper quartile) and low levels of 25(OH)D (lower quartile) remained significantly associated to frailty [OR for PINP: 2.19 (95% CI, 1.15\u20134.18; P\u00a0=\u00a00.017); OR for 25(OH)D: 1.65 (95% CI, 1.02\u20132.67; P\u00a0=\u00a00.042)]. Women with both high PINP levels and low 25(OH)D levels presented a 5.85-fold increased frailty risk (95% CI, 1.64\u201320.93; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). The main contribution of this paper is the novel definition of PINP and 25(OH)D markers as potential biomarkers of frailty and targets for intervention.",

     "abstract": "During the aging process, the body's systems change structurally and loss of function can occur. Ingesting a smaller amount of food has been considered a plausible proposal for increased longevity with the quality of life. However, the effects of dietary restriction (DR) during aging are still poorly understood, especially for organs of the digestive system. This study aimed to describe the body weight, oxidative status and possible morphological changes of the intestinal wall of rats submitted to DR during the aging process (7 to 18\u00a0months old). Twelve 7-month-old male Wistar rats fed ad libitum since birth were assigned to two groups: control group (CG, n\u00a0=\u00a06) fed ad libitum from 7 to 18\u00a0months old; and dietary restriction group (DRG, n\u00a0=\u00a06) fed 50% of the amount of chow consumed by the CG from 7 to 18\u00a0months old. The body weight, feed and water intake were monitored throughout the experiment. Blood, periepididymal adipose tissue (PAT) and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RAT), and the small intestine were collected at 18\u00a0months old. The blood was collected to evaluate its components and oxidative status. Sections from the duodenum and ileum were stained with HE, PAS and AB pH\u00a02.5 for morphometric analyses of the intestinal wall components, and to count intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), goblet cells and cells in mitosis in the epithelium. DR rats showed a reduction in weight, naso-anal length, PAT, RAT and intestinal length; however, they consumed more water. Blood parameters indicate that the DR rats remained well nourished. In addition, they showed lower lipid peroxidation. Hypertrophy of the duodenal mucosa and atrophy of the ileal mucosa were observed. The number of goblet cells and IELs was reduced, but the mitotic index remained unaltered in both duodenum and ileum. In conclusion, 50% dietary restriction for rats from 7 to 18\u00a0months old contributed to improving their nutritional parameters but, to achieve this, adjustments were required in the structure of the body weight and morphology of the small intestine.",

Therefore regulating oxidative defense mechanisms might be an ideal approach in improving male sexual dysfunctions. In the present study, the effect of Korean red ginseng aqueous extract (KRG) on age-induced testicular dysfunction in rats was investigated. KRG (200\u00a0mg/kg) mixed with regular pellet diet was administered orally for six months and the morphological, spermatogenic and antioxidant enzyme status in testis of aged rats (18\u00a0months) were evaluated. Data indicated a significant change in morphology and decrease in spermatogenesis-related parameters in aged rats (AC) compared with young rats (YC). Sperm number, germ cell count, Sertoli cell count and Sertoli cell index were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) restored in KRG-treated aged rat groups (G-AC). Further the increased lipid peroxidation as measured by malondialdehyde (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and altered enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and catalase) and non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione, ascorbic acid and \u03b1-tocopherol) antioxidants (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were attenuated by KRG treatment in aged rats to near normal levels as in YC groups. Furthermore, proteomic analysis demonstrated differential expression of selected proteins such as phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, fatty acid binding protein-9, triosephosphate isomerase-1 and aldehyde (aldose) reductase-1in aged rats was significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) protected by KRG treatment.

The sarcopenia diagnosis algorithm developed by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and used in the present study needs further validation through cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The aim of the present study is to assess, using this algorithm, the prevalence of sarcopenia and the clinical components linked to this geriatric syndrome.Participants were community dwelling subjects aged 65\u00a0years or older. To diagnose sarcopenia, we applied the definition of the EWGSOP. Muscle mass was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength by a hydraulic dynamometer and physical performance by the SPPB test. Large amounts of socio-demographic, anamnestic and clinical data were collected in all subjects.534 subjects were recruited for this study (60.5% of women, mean age of 73.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.16\u00a0years), among whom 73 subjects were diagnosed sarcopenic, which represents a global prevalence of 13.7%. Prevalence was 11.8% in men and 14.9% in women. Sarcopenic subjects were older; had a lower Body Mass Index, lower calf, waist, wrist and arm circumferences; presented more cognitive impairments (Mini-Mental State Examination), more comorbidities; were more often malnourished; and consumed more drugs. After adjustment for age, BMI, cognitive status, nutritional status, number of comorbidities and number of drugs, sarcopenic subjects had a worse physical health-related quality of life (SF-36) for the domain of physical functioning, were at higher risk of falls (Timed Up and Go test), were more frail (Fried), presented more often tiredness for the achievement of activities of daily living (Mobility-test), presented less fat mass and obviously less lean mass. Sarcopenic women were also more dependent for housekeeping and handling finances (Lawton scale) than non-sarcopenic ones.Sarcopenia seems to be associated with many harmful clinical components making this geriatric syndrome a real public health burden. Follow-up data of the SarcoPhAge study will be helpful to assess the outcomes of sarcopenia based on the EWGSOP diagnosis algorithm and its different proposed cut-offs.",

     "abstract": "Apoptosis plays an important role in atrophy and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CR and WR with CR would ameliorate age-induced elevation of EndoG and AIF while protecting HSP27 and HSP70 levels in the plantaris. Male Fischer-344 rats were divided into 4 groups at 11\u00a0weeks: ad libitum feeding until 6\u00a0months (YAL); fed ad libitum until 24\u00a0months old (OAL); 8%CR to 24\u00a0months (OCR); WR\u00a0+\u00a08%CR to 24\u00a0months (OExCR). Nuclear EndoG levels were significantly higher in OAL (+\u00a0153%) than in YAL, while CR (\u2212\u00a038%) and WR with CR (\u2212\u00a046%) significantly attenuated age-induced increment in nuclear EndoG. HSP27 (\u2212\u00a063%) protein content and phosphorylation at Ser82 (\u2212\u00a049%) were significantly lower in OAL than in YAL, while HSP27 protein content was significantly higher in OCR (+\u00a0136%) and OExCR (+\u00a0155%) and p-HSP27 (+\u00a0254%) was significantly higher in OExCR compared with OAL, respectively. In contrast, AIF and HSP70 were unaltered by CR or WR with CR in aging muscle. These data indicate that CR and WR with CR attenuate age-associated upregulation of EndoG translocation in the nucleus, potentially involved with HSP27 signaling.",

Within subgroups Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests were also used to examine differences in GFI-scores across age groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations between individual characteristics and frailty.The GFI discriminated between subgroups: statistically significantly higher GFI-median scores (interquartile range) were found in e.g. males (1 [0\u20132]), the oldest old (2 [1\u20133]), in elderly who were single (1 [0\u20132]), with lower socio economic status (1 [0\u20133]), with increasing co-morbidity (2 [1\u20133]), who were obese (2 [1\u20133]), and used more healthcare (2 [1\u20134]). Overall age had an independent and statistically significant association with GFI scores. Compared with the non-frail, frail elderly persons experienced statistically significantly more chronic stress and more social/psychological related problems. In the multivariate logistic regression model, psychological morbidity had the strongest association with frailty.The present study supports the construct validity of the GFI and provides an insight in the characteristics of (non)frail community-dwelling elderly persons participating in LifeLines.",

This study further showed that RT may have acute effect on T production and clearance rates, while the exercise-induced increases in serum T appeared to be induced by decreased metabolic clearance rate of T.

     "abstract": "There is considerable support for the view that aerobic exercise may confer cognitive benefits to mild cognitively impaired elderly persons. However, the biological mechanisms mediating these effects are not entirely clear. As a preliminary step towards informing this gap in knowledge, we enrolled older adults confirmed to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a 6-month exercise program. Male and female subjects were randomized into a 6-month program of either aerobic or stretch (control) exercise. Data collected from the first 10 completers, aerobic exercise (n\u00a0=\u00a05) or stretch (control) exercise (n\u00a0=\u00a05), were used to determine intervention-induced changes in the global gene expression profiles of the aerobic and stretch groups. Using microarray, we identified genes with altered expression (relative to baseline values) in response to the 6-month exercise intervention. Genes whose expression were altered by at least two-fold, and met the p-value cutoff of 0.01 were inputted into the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base Library to generate gene-interaction networks. After a 6-month aerobic exercise-training, genes promoting inflammation became down-regulated, whereas genes having anti-inflammatory properties and those modulating immune function or promoting neuron survival and axon growth, became up-regulated (all fold change\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). These changes were not observed in the stretch group. Importantly, the differences in the expression profiles correlated with significant improvement in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in the aerobic program as opposed to the stretch group. We conclude that three distinct cellular pathways may collectively influence the training effects of aerobic exercise in MCI subjects. We plan to confirm these effects using rt-PCR and correlate such changes with the cognitive phenotype.",

However, growing lines of evidence suggest that the effects of environmental stressors on survival and longevity depend on a multitude of factors and, under some circumstances, might be positive rather than negative. Here, using the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), we show that repeated exposure to stressful conditions (i.e. unpredictable food availability), which induced no changes in body mass, was associated with a decrease in mortality rate and an increase in the age of death. As expected, the treated birds responded to the unpredictable food supply by increasing baseline glucocorticoid stress hormone secretion and there were no signs of habituation of this hormonal response to the treatment across time. Importantly, and consistent with previous literature, the magnitude of hormone increase induced by the treatment was significant, but relatively mild, since the baseline glucocorticoid concentrations in the treated birds were substantially lower than the peak levels that occur during an acute stress response in this species. Taken together, these data demonstrate that protracted exposure to relatively mild stressful circumstances can have beneficial lifespan effects.",

     "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid protein in the brain (in both soluble and insoluble forms) and by the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), leading to neurotoxicity. The exact mechanisms whereby A\u03b2 triggers brain alterations are unclear. However, accumulating evidence suggests that a deregulation of Ca2\u00a0+ signaling may play a major role in disease progression. Calcium-buffering proteins, including calbindin-D28K (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV), may offer neuroprotection by maintaining calcium homeostasis. Although marked reductions in these proteins have been observed in the brains of mice and humans with AD, their contribution to AD pathology remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyze distribution patterns of CB+, CR+ and PV+ interneurons in different areas of the hippocampus, a brain region that is severely affected in AD. A transgenic knock-in APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of familial AD was used. The data were obtained from the brains of 3- and 12-month-old animals. These ages roughly correspond to an early mature adult (prior to clinical manifestations) and a late middle-age (clinical symptoms readily detectable) phase in human AD patients. Immunostaining revealed increases in CB and PV immunoreactivity (IR) in the hippocampus of 3-month-old transgenic mice, compared to wild-type animals. Possibly, these proteins are upregulated in an attempt to control cellular homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. However, the pattern of CB-IR was reversed in 12-month-old animals, potentially indicating a loss of cellular capacity to respond to pathophysiological processes. In addition, at this age, a noticeable increase in PV-IR was observed, suggesting the presence of hippocampal network hyperactivity in older AD-like mice. Our results indicate that CaBP+ neuronal subpopulations play a role in adult neurogenesis and in AD pathology, particularly at early disease stages, suggesting that these neurons may serve as potential predictors of future AD in non-demented individuals.",

The present study investigated the effect of cranberry anthocyanin (CrA) extract on the lifespan of fruit flies with focus on its interaction with aging-related genes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), methuselah (MTH), insulin receptor (InR), target of rapamycin (TOR), hemipterus (Hep), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Results showed that diet containing 20\u00a0mg/mL CrA could significantly prolong the mean lifespan of fruit flies by 10% compared with the control diet. This was accompanied by up-regulation of SOD1 and down-regulation of MTH, InR, TOR and PEPCK. The stress resistance test demonstrated that CrA could reduce the mortality rate induced by H2O2 but not by paraquat. It was therefore concluded that the lifespan-prolonging activity of CrA was most likely mediated by modulating the genes of SOD1, MTH, InR, TOR and PEPCK.",

The genetic determinants of dysphagia are still being explored and have largely been studied through candidate gene analysis approaches. The aim of the study was to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of common genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and self-reported swallowing impairments in a longitudinal cohort of community dwelling older adults.We performed a case\u2013control genome-wide association study of self-reported swallowing symptoms using the Sydney Swallow Questionnaire. The analysis included 555 community dwelling, unrelated, older adults (mean years of age\u00a0=\u00a081.4; SD\u00a0=\u00a05.349) with known phenotype and genetic information consisting of 512,806 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Gene-based association analysis of these traits was also conducted.Analysis of the cohort confirmed European ancestry with no major population stratification. Further analysis for association with swallowing impairment identified one SNP rs17601696 which achieved genome-wide significance (P-value\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a08) within a non-coding region of chromosome 10. Gene-based analysis did not result in any genome-wide significant association.SNP rs17601696 may have an impact on swallowing impairment among elderly individuals.

The present study tested whether feeding flies with frozen yeast rather than with fresh yeast could have some effect on these traits, the other components of the food being similar in the two groups. Freezing altered live yeast quality and flies feeding on frozen yeast lived slightly less (males), were less fecund at older ages, and poorly resisted to some severe stresses (cold and starvation), no negative effect being observed on resistance to heat.

     "abstract": "Age-dependent decline in melatonin level induces nitro-oxidative stress that compromises physiological homeostasis including reproduction. However, less information exist regarding the age-dependent variation in local melatonin (lMel) concentration and MT1R expression in testis and its interaction with testicular steroidogenesis and nitro-oxidative stress in golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus. Therefore, we evaluated lMel level along with MT1R expression and its possible interaction with steroidogenesis and nitro-oxidative stress in testes of young (6\u00a0weeks), adult (15\u00a0weeks) and old (2\u00a0years) aged hamsters. Further, we injected the old hamsters with melatonin to address whether age-related decline in lMel and MT1R is responsible for the reduction in testicular steroidogenesis and antioxidant status. Increased expression of steroidogenic markers suggests increased testicular steroidogenesis in adult hamsters that declined in old hamsters. An age-dependent elevation in the level of NOX, TBARS, corticosterone and the expression of iNOS and GR with a concomitant decrease in enzyme activities for SOD, CAT, GSH-PX indicate increased nitro-oxidative stress in testes. Data suggest that reproductive senescence in male hamsters might be a consequence of declined lMel concentration with MT1R expression inducing nitro-oxidative stress resulting in diminished testicular steroidogenesis. However, administration of Mel in old-aged hamsters significantly increased steroidogenesis and antioxidant status without a significant variation in lMel concentration and MT1R expression in testes. Therefore, decreased lMel and MT1R might not be the causative factor underlying the age-associated decrease in antioxidant defence and steroidogenesis in testes. In conclusion, Mel induced amelioration of testicular oxidative insult and elevation of steroidogenic activity suggests a potential role of increased nitro-oxidative stress underlying the age-dependent decrease in steroidogenesis.",

Senescent cells accumulate with age in a variety of human and mouse tissues where they express a complex \u2018senescence-associated secretory phenotype\u2019 (SASP). The SASP includes many pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and proteases that have the potential to cause or exacerbate age-related pathology, both degenerative and hyperplastic. While cellular senescence in peripheral tissues has recently been linked to a number of age-related pathologies, its involvement in brain aging is just beginning to be explored. Recent data generated by several laboratories suggest that both aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by an increase in SASP-expressing senescent cells of non-neuronal origin in the brain. Moreover, this increase correlates with neurodegeneration. Senescent cells in the brain could therefore constitute novel therapeutic targets for treating age-related neuropathologies.",

Epigenetics, in turn, can cause and is associated with several neurodegenerative and aging-dependent human diseases. Alzheimer's disease certainly represents one of the most relevant neurodegenerative disorders due to its incidence and its huge socio-economic impact. Therefore, it is easy to understand why recent literature focuses on the epigenetic modifications associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.One of the most intriguing and, at the same time, worrying evidence is that even \u201cmild\u201d environmental factors (such as behavioral or physical stress) as well as the under-threshold exposure to pollutants and chemicals, can be effective. Finally, even mild nutrients disequilibria can result in long-lasting and functional alterations of many epigenetic markers, although they don't have an immediate acute effect. Therefore, we will probably have to re-define the current risk threshold for many factors, molecules and stresses.Among the many different environmental factors affecting the epigenome, nutrition represents one of the most investigated fields; the reasons are probably that each person interacts with nutrients and that, in turn, nutrients can modulate at molecular level the epigenetic biochemical pathways. The role that nutrition can exert in modulating epigenetic modifications in Alzheimer's disease will be discussed with particular emphasis on the role of B vitamins and DNA methylation.",

Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder, is characterized by the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein protein in Lewy body inclusions and the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Based on their pathological signatures, AD and PD can be considered as two different disease entities. However, a subpopulation of PD patients also exhibit A\u03b2 plaques, and AD patients exhibit \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. This overlap between PD and AD suggests that common pathological pathways exist for the two diseases. Identification of factors and cellular mechanisms by which these factors can trigger pathological hallmarks for AD/PD overlap may help in designing disease-modifying therapies that can reverse or stop the progression of AD and PD.For the last decade, work in our laboratory has shown that fluctuations in the levels of cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) may correlate with the onset of AD and PD. In this review, we will provide results from our laboratory and data from literature that converge to strongly suggest the involvement of cholesterol and cholesterol oxidation products in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. We will specifically delineate the role of and the underlying mechanisms by which increased levels of the oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and AD/PD overlap.",

Although environmental exposure to H2S has been viewed alternately as therapeutic or toxic through the centuries, H2S has recently regained recognition for its numerous beneficial biological effects. Most experiments documenting such benefits, including improved glucose tolerance, increased stress resistance, and even lifespan extension, are based on exposure of experimental organisms to exogenous sources of H2S. However, appreciation is growing for the importance of H2S produced endogenously by the evolutionary conserved transsulfuration pathway (TSP) in health and longevity. Recent data implicate H2S produced by the TSP in pleiotropic benefits of dietary restriction (DR), or reduced nutrient/energy intake without malnutrition. DR, best known as the most reliable way to extend lifespan in a wide range of experimental organisms, includes various regimens aimed at either reducing overall calorie intake (calorie restriction, intermittent/every-other-day fasting) or reducing particular nutrients such as protein or the essential amino acid, methionine (methionine restriction), with overlapping functional benefits on stress resistance, metabolic fitness and lifespan. Here we will review the small but growing body of literature linking the TSP to the functional benefits of DR in part through the production of endogenous H2S, with an emphasis on regulation of the TSP and H2S production by diet and mechanisms of beneficial H2S action.",

While logical, this is extremely challenging as the molecular mechanisms that drive aging are still unknown. Furthermore, clinical trials to treat aging are impractical. Even in preclinical models, testing interventions to extend healthspan in old age are lengthy and therefore costly. One approach to expedite aging studies is to take advantage of mouse strains that are engineered to age rapidly. These strains are genetically and phenotypically quite diverse.

     "abstract": "The human epidermis provides a very effective barrier function against chemical, physical and microbial insults from the environment. This is only possible as the epidermis renews itself constantly. Stem cells located at the basal lamina which forms the dermoepidermal junction provide an almost inexhaustible source of keratinocytes which differentiate and die during their journey to the surface where they are shed off as scales. Despite the continuous renewal of the epidermis it nevertheless succumbs to aging as the turnover rate of the keratinocytes is slowing down dramatically. Aging is associated with such hallmarks as thinning of the epidermis, elastosis, loss of melanocytes associated with an increased paleness and lucency of the skin and a decreased barrier function. As the differentiation of keratinocytes is strictly calcium dependent, calcium also plays an important role in the aging epidermis.Just recently it was shown that the epidermal calcium gradient in the skin that facilitates the proliferation of keratinocytes in the stratum basale and enables differentiation in the stratum granulosum is lost in the process of skin aging. In the course of this review we try to explain how this calcium gradient is built up on the one hand and is lost during aging on the other hand. How this disturbed calcium homeostasis is affecting the gene expression in aged skin and is leading to dramatic changes in the composition of the cornified envelope will also be discussed. This loss of the epidermal calcium gradient is not only specific for skin aging but can also be found in skin diseases such as Darier disease, Hailey\u2013Hailey disease, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, which might be very helpful to get a deeper insight in skin aging.",

Furthermore, we address several potential mechanisms through which the age-related reductions in GH and IGF-1 affect cognition. Together, the studies reviewed here highlight the importance of maintaining GH and IGF-1 signaling in order to sustain proper brain function throughout the lifespan.",

     "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is the characteristic pathology in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the nature and molecular mechanism leading to the degeneration are not clarified. Given that only the neurons filled with neurofibrillary tangles survive to the end stage of the disease and the major component of the tangles is the hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, it is conceivable that tau hyperphosphorylation must play a crucial role in AD neurodegeneration. We have demonstrated that tau hyperphosphorylation renders the cells more resistant to the acute apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms involve substrate competition of tau and \u03b2-catenin for glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2); activation of Akt; preservation of Bcl-2 and suppression of Bax, cytosolic cytochrome-c, and caspase-3 activity; and upregulation of unfolded protein response (UPR), i.e., up-regulating phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2 and IRE1 with an increased cleavage of ATF6 and ATF4. On the other hand, tau hyperphosphorylation promotes its intracellular accumulation and disrupts axonal transport; hyperphosphorylated tau also impairs cholinergic function and inhibits proteasome activity. These findings indicate that tau hyperphosphorylation and its intracellular accumulation play dual role in the evolution of AD. We speculate that transient tau phosphorylation helps cells abort from an acute apoptosis, while persistent tau hyperphosphorylation/accumulation may trigger cell senescence that eventually causes a chronic neurodegeneration. Therefore, the nature of \u201cAD neurodegeneration\u201d may represent a new type of tau-regulated chronic neuron death; and the stage of cell senescence may provide a broad window for the intervention of AD.",

     "abstract": "Leydig cell testosterone (T) production is reduced with age, resulting in reduced serum T levels (hypogonadism). A number of cellular changes have been identified in the steroidogenic pathway of aged Leydig cells that are associated with reduced T formation, including reductions in luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated cAMP production, the cholesterol transport proteins steroidogenic acute regulatory (STAR) protein and translocator protein (TSPO), and downstream steroidogenic enzymes of the mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Many of the changes in steroid formation that characterize aged Leydig cells can be elicited by the experimental alteration of the redox environment of young cells, suggesting that changes in the intracellular redox balance may cause reduced T production. Hypogonadism is estimated to affect about 5 million American men, including both aged and young. This condition has been linked to mood changes, worsening cognition, fatigue, depression, decreased lean body mass, reduced bone mineral density, increased visceral fat, metabolic syndrome, decreased libido, and sexual dysfunction. Exogenous T administration is now used widely to elevate serum T levels in hypogonadal men and thus to treat symptoms of hypogonadism. However, recent evidence suggests that men who take exogenous T may face increased risk of stroke, heart attack, and prostate tumorigenesis. Moreover, it is well established that administered T can have suppressive effects on LH, resulting in lower Leydig cell T production, reduced intratesticular T concentration, and reduced spermatogenesis. This makes exogenous T administration inappropriate for men who wish to father children. There are promising new approaches to increase serum T by directly stimulating Leydig cell T production rather than by exogenous T therapy, thus potentially avoiding some of its negative consequences.",

Intrinsic mortality is assumed to be a result of aging and to increase over age, whereas extrinsic mortality is assumed to be a result of environmental hazards and be constant over age. However, allegedly intrinsic and extrinsic mortality have an exponentially increasing age pattern in common. Theories of aging assert that a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic stressors underlies the increasing risk of death. Epidemiological and biological data support that the control of intrinsic as well as extrinsic stressors can alleviate the aging process. We argue that aging and death can be better explained by the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic stressors than by classifying mortality itself as being either intrinsic or extrinsic. Recognition of the tight interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic stressors in the causation of aging leads to the recognition that aging is not inevitable, but malleable through the environment.",

Despite the fact that a growing proportion of cardiac surgery patients are octogenarians, cardioplegic regimes remain comparable across patients of all ages. We compared the hemodynamic performance, metabolic parameters and ultrastructural changes in adult and senescent rat hearts after application of Buckberg's blood cardioplegia (BCP) to evaluate differences between the age groups regarding postischemic myocardial function and cellular ultrastructure.Hearts of adult (young adult group, 3\u20134\u00a0months) and senescent (old group, 24\u00a0months) male Wistar rats were excised and inserted into a blood perfused isolated heart apparatus (Langendorff perfusion). After a stabilization period of 30\u00a0min, in 16 adult and 16 senescent hearts, Buckberg BCP was administered antegradely and repeated every 20\u00a0min. Six young adult and 3 senescent hearts served as ischemia control. After an aortic clamping time of 90\u00a0min an antegrade hot shot was administered. During reperfusion ex vivo cardiac functional parameters were recorded, including coronary blood flow, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and velocity of myocardial contraction or relaxation (+/\u2212\u00a0dp/dt). Oxygen consumption and lactate production of the hearts were calculated. After perfusion fixation, the hearts of five rats in each BCP group and 3 rats in each ischemia group were investigated for cellular edema and mitochondrial damage by morphometry using transmission electron microscopy.While recovery of cardiac function after 90\u00a0min of unprotected ischemia was significantly impaired in senescent hearts, functional recovery after ischemia protected by BCP was similar in adult and senescent hearts. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was severely damaged in both age groups after 90\u00a0min ischemia, but well preserved in both BCP groups. The qualitative analysis was confirmed by the morphometric cellular edema index and the volume-to-surface ratio of the mitochondria. Myocardial oxygen consumption was highest and lactate production was lowest in senescent hearts.Senescent rat hearts were more susceptible to unprotected ischemia/reperfusion injury than young adult hearts. When protected by BCP, we found no difference in hemodynamic performance between adult and senescent hearts indicating preserved myocardial protection even in senescent individuals.",

In this study we investigated whether aerobic exercise training has the potential to alter anabolic and catabolic pathways in the skeletal muscle. Five and twenty eight month old rats were used in the study. Aging resulted in decreased levels of follistatin/mTOR/Akt/Erk activation and increased myostatin/Murf1/2, proteasome subunits, and protein ubiquitination levels. In addition, TNF-\u03b1, reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53, and Bax levels were increased while Bcl-2 levels were decreased in the skeletal muscle of aged rats. Six weeks of exercise training at 60% of VO2max reversed the age-associated activation of catabolic and apoptotic pathways and increased anabolic signaling. The results suggest that the age-associated loss of muscle mass and cachexia could be due to the orchestrated down-regulation of anabolic and up-regulation of catabolic and pro-apoptotic processes. These metabolic changes can be attenuated by exercise training.",

     "abstract": "A detailed knowledge of the mechanisms underlying brain aging is fundamental to understand its functional decline and the baseline upon which brain pathologies superimpose. Endogenous protective mechanisms must contribute to the adaptability and plasticity still present in the healthy aged brain. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is one of the few genes with a consistent and evolutionarily conserved up-regulation in the aged brain. ApoD protecting roles upon stress or injury are well known, but a study of the effects of ApoD expression in the normal aging process is still missing.Using an ApoD-knockout mouse we analyze the effects of ApoD on factors contributing to the functional maintenance of the aged brain. We focused our cellular and molecular analyses in the cortex and hippocampus at an age representing the onset of senescence where mortality risks are below 25%, avoiding bias towards long-lived animals. Lack of ApoD causes a prematurely aged brain without altering lifespan. Age-dependent hyperkinesia and memory deficits are accompanied by differential molecular effects in the cortex and hippocampus. Transcriptome analyses reveal distinct effects of ApoD loss on the molecular age-dependent patterns of the cortex and hippocampus, with different cell-type contributions to age-regulated gene expression. Markers of glial reactivity, proteostasis, and oxidative and inflammatory damage reveal early signs of aging and enhanced brain deterioration in the ApoD-knockout brain. The lack of ApoD results in an age-enhanced significant reduction in neuronal calcium-dependent functionality markers and signs of early reduction of neuronal numbers in the cortex, thus impinging upon parameters clearly differentiating neurodegenerative conditions from healthy brain aging. Our data support the hypothesis that the physiological increased brain expression of ApoD represents a homeostatic anti-aging mechanism.",

The inhibition of ROS signal by antioxidants reduced rBTI-mediated longevity by up to 65%. Moreover, it was shown that the disruption of daf-2 abolished the extension of the lifespan and the increased ROS.

     "abstract": "The cornea protects the anterior eye and accounts for two thirds of the eyes refractive capacity. The homeostasis of corneal epithelium is thought to be maintained by putative stem cells residing in the epithelial basal layer. As a tissue constantly exposed to environmental stress, the cornea is hypothesised to accumulate persistent DNA damage events with time in stem cell populations. Recently, telomere associated DNA damage foci (TAFs) have been suggested as a marker for persistent DNA damage which can be used to detect senescent cells during ageing. Dietary restriction (DR) is the only known non-genetic intervention that is able to increase both life and health span among various animal species. The aim of this study was to analyse changes in corneal properties with age and under 16\u00a0months of DR. We employed immunofluorescence staining for \u0263H2A.X together with telomere fluorescence in situ hybridisation (immuno-FISH) on mouse corneas from young, old ad libitum (AL) fed as well as dietary restricted (DR) mice. Our data show that the central corneas of old mice had significantly more general and telomere-associated DNA damage compared to young mice while DR treatment was able to reduce the amount of DNA damage significantly. We also found that the thickness of the peripheral region of the cornea, where the putative stem cells may reside, decreased with age regardless of whether the animals underwent DR treatment or not. Number of bullae, which indicates corneal edema, accumulated in old corneas in the central area and DR treatment mitigated the formation of these bullae. Moreover, the protein levels of the stem cell marker TAp63 decreased with age only in the central but not the peripheral region of the cornea. This finding suggests that epithelial progenitors might be better maintained in the peripheral than the central cornea during ageing. Together with the finding that the peripheral corneal showed no increase in DNA damage during age, we speculate that in mice, like humans, the putative stem cells reside in the peripheral cornea.",

Administration of anti-tau antibodies to transgenic \u201ctauopathy mice\u201d has been shown to reduce their tau pathology but the mechanisms responsible are unclear. To examine the effects of anti-tau antibodies on tau phosphorylation, we used western blots to study the effects of three antibodies to phosphorylated tau (pTau), namely anti-pTau S199, T231, and S396, and three antibodies to non-phosphorylated tau on in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant human tau-441 at S199. Inclusion of an anti-pTau T231 antibody in the phosphorylation reaction reduced the intensity of monomeric pTau S199 in western blots of denaturing gels, but the other antibodies had no apparent effects on this process. Surprisingly, including all three anti-phospho-tau antibodies in the reaction did not reduce the intensity of the monomer band, possibly due to steric hindrance between the antibodies.These preliminary findings suggest that anti-tau antibodies may have minimal direct effects on tau phosphorylation. Limitations of using western blots to examine the effects of anti-tau antibodies on this process were found to include between-experiment variability in pTau band densities and poor resolution of high molecular weight pTau oligomers. The presence of bands representing immunoglobulins as well as pTau may also complicate interpretation of the western blots. Further studies are indicated to examine the effects of anti-pTau antibodies on phosphorylation of other tau amino acids in addition to S199.",

The present work demonstrates the protective effect of PQQ producing EcN against rotenone induced mitochondrial oxidative stress and consequence of mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction in naturally ageing rat model. PQQ is a potent antioxidant molecule also known to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function in mammals.Firstly, adult rats (16\u201318\u00a0weeks old) were treated with rotenone (2.5\u00a0mg/kg body weight; i.p.) daily for 28\u00a0days along with PQQ (10\u00a0mg/kg diet, daily) and modified probiotic EcN strains (108\u00a0CFU twice weekly). Secondly, ageing rats (48\u201350\u00a0weeks old) were gavaged with probiotic EcN strains (108\u00a0CFU twice weekly) and PQQ (10\u00a0mg/kg diet, daily) for 8\u00a0months.PQQ producing EcN-5 treatment prevented rotenone induced hepatic oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in rats as assessed by reduced lipid peroxidation (29%), elevated glutathione (GSH) content (43%), increased catalase (52%) and superoxide dismutase (52%) activities when compared to only rotenone treatment. Moreover, increased hepatic mitochondrial content (41%), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) mRNA (25%) and mitochondrial Superoxide Dismutase (Mit-SOD) activity (94%) were also observed in EcN-5 treated rats. Rotenone treated rats did not exhibit gain in body weight, whereas rats co-treated with EcN-5 showed significant restoration in body weight gain. Furthermore, weekly administration of EcN-5 to naturally ageing rats for eight months resulted in significant reduction of oxidative stress in hepatic and colonic tissues (assessed by lipid peroxidation, GSH content and catalase and SOD enzyme activities) along with increase in hepatic mitochondrial enzyme activities (Mit-SOD and succinate dehydrogenase) and biogenesis, when compared to untreated rats. Additionally, these rats also exhibited reduced expression of fatty acid synthase (50%) and increased expression of acyl coenzyme oxidase (225%) genes in liver in contrast to untreated rats resulting in lowered triglyceride (13% & 13.5%) and cholesterol (21% & 27%) levels in plasma and liver, respectively. Increased levels of butyrate (93%), propionate (45%) and acetate (18%) were also found in colonic content of these rats. PQQ administered daily (supplemented in diet) exhibited more or less similar effect as weekly gavaged EcN-5 in both the experiments, which substantiate that these effects are mediated by PQQ.These results suggest that genetically modified EcN-5 can be used as a nutritional supplement which can reduce age related oxidative stress and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, it also rejuvenates healthy mitochondria by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism.",

The age-adjusted estimates and CI were as follows: LS: \u2212\u00a00.10 (\u2212\u00a00.71; 0.52); right TH: \u2212\u00a00.13 (\u2212\u00a00.66; 0.41); left TH: \u2212\u00a00.13 (\u2212\u00a00.67; 0.42); right FN: \u2212\u00a00.03 (\u2212\u00a00.58; 0.52) and left FN: 0.09 (\u2212\u00a00.47; 0.66).In conclusion, we found no statistically significant associations between BMD and LTL, although the estimates of the crude associations were all positive, indicating hypothesis consistency; that shorter LTL predict lower BMD values. This positive association was no longer apparent after adjusting for age.As expected, age was statistically significantly associated with both telomere length and BMI adjusted BMD.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the joint trajectories of chronic multimorbidity among the Taiwanese elderly and to examine related factors and to predict later successful aging outcomes. The data used in this study were from a nation-representative panel survey conducted in Taiwan from 1993 to 2007. Those who participated in at least three waves of the survey were included in the analysis (in total 2584 persons and 57,012 observations). The chronic diseases included cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic non-specific lung disease (CNSLD), arthritis, cancer, gastrointestinal disease (GI), and kidney disease. The multiple group-based trajectories analysis approach was applied to identify the trajectory groups. Four trajectory groups of multimorbidity were identified: low risk (55.51%), CVD risk only (15.55%), GI & CNSLD risk (20.20%), and multiple risks (8.74%). Related factors included age, level of education, physical functioning, depressive symptoms, and undergoing health examinations. The multimorbidity trajectories affected later physical functioning, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and life satisfaction. Multiple trajectories of multimorbidity show the patterns of health burden and risks to successful aging among the elderly over time.",

     "abstract": "Falls are prevalent in older adults and are predicted by the maximum forward lean magnitude (MRLM) that can be recovered using a single step. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of selected neuromuscular and biomechanical variables associated with balance recovery to the MRLM. Forward loss of balance was induced by releasing participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0117 community-dwelling older adults) from a static forward lean angle. Participants were instructed to attempt to recover balance by taking a single step. A scalable anatomical model consisting of 36 degrees-of-freedom was used to compute kinematics and joint moments from motion capture and force plate data. Isometric muscle strength at the ankle, knee and hip joints was assessed using a dynamometer. A univariate analysis revealed that lower limb strength measures, step recovery kinematics, and stepping limb kinetics accounted for between 8 and 19%, 3 and 59%, and 3 and 61% of the variance in MRLM respectively. When all variables were entered into a stepwise multiple regression analysis, normalised step length, peak hip extension moment, trunk angle at foot contact, and peak hip flexion power during stepping together accounted for 69% of the variance in MRLM. These findings confirm that successful recovery from forward loss of balance is a whole body control task that requires adequate trunk control and generation of adequate lower limb moments and powers to generate a long and rapid step. Training programmes that specifically target these measures may be effective in improving balance recovery performance and thereby contribute to fall prevention amongst older adults.",

Telomere shortening and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be central to the cellular aging process. The present study examined the association between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and telomere length in a sample of medically healthy adults. Participants (total n\u00a0=\u00a0392) were divided into 4 groups based on the presence or absence of early life adversity and lifetime psychopathology: No Adversity/No Disorder, n\u00a0=\u00a0136; Adversity/No Disorder, n\u00a0=\u00a091; No Adversity/Disorder, n\u00a0=\u00a046; Adversity/Disorder, n\u00a0=\u00a0119. Telomere length and mtDNA copy number were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. There was a positive correlation between mtDNA and telomere length in the entire sample (r\u00a0=\u00a00.120, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and in each of the four groups of participants (No Adversity/No Disorder, r\u00a0=\u00a00.291, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001; Adversity/No Disorder r\u00a0=\u00a00.279, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007; No Adversity/Disorder r\u00a0=\u00a00.449, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; Adversity/Disorder, r\u00a0=\u00a00.558, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). These correlations remained significant when controlling for age, smoking, and body mass index and establish an association between mtDNA and telomere length in a large group of women and men both with and without early adversity and psychopathology, suggesting co-regulation of telomeres and mitochondrial function. The mechanisms underlying this association may be important in the pathophysiology of age-related medical conditions, such as heart disease and cancer, as well as for stress-associated psychiatric disorders.",

Protein content is a major determinant of skeletal muscle size. This study was designed to determine if age and sex differentially impact basal muscle protein synthesis and mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. We performed a secondary data analysis on a cohort of 215 healthy, non-obese (BMI\u00a0<\u00a030\u00a0kg\u00b7m\u2212\u00a02) young (18\u201340\u00a0y; 74 men, 52 women) and older (60\u201387\u00a0y; 57 men, 32 women) adults.

FSR and mTORC1 signaling were measured at rest and after an overnight fast. mTORC1 and S6K1 phosphorylation were higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in older subjects with no sex differences. However, there were no age or sex differences or interaction for muscle FSR (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Body mass index, fat free mass, or body fat was not a significant covariate and did not influence the results. We conclude that age and sex do not influence basal muscle protein synthesis.

Physical activity and an optimal status of micro- and macronutrients are known to reduce the incidence of MN, a marker for chromosomal instability and mutagenicity. Once older people reach a certain age they change from a home-living situation to an institutionalized situation, which is often accompanied by malnutrition, depression and inactivity. We conducted the current study to investigate the effect of a six month progressive resistance training (RT), with or without protein and vitamin supplementation (RTS) or cognitive training (CT) only, on chromosomal damage measured by the cytokinesis block micronucleus cytome assay in 97 Austrian institutionalized women and men (65\u201398\u00a0years). All three intervention groups demonstrated a tendency of a reduced frequency of cells with MN (\u2212\u00a015%) as well as for the total number of MN (\u2212\u00a020%), however no significant time-effect was observed. Besides a significant increase in plasma B12 and red blood cell folate status, the six month change of B12 was negatively correlated with the six month change of the MN frequency in the RTS group (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.584, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Our results suggest that in this age group either physical or cognitive training may result in similar biochemical changes and therefore enhance resistance against genomic instability.

Therefore, we compared morphology and function of skeletal muscles between different age groups. Changes in high-energy phosphate turnover (PCr, Pi and pH) and muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) parameters, including proton transverse relaxation time (T2), diffusion (D) and vascular volume fraction (f), were investigated in moderately exercised low back muscles of young and late-middle-aged healthy subjects with 31P-MR spectroscopy, T2- and diffusion-weighted MRI at 3\u00a0T. In addition, T1-weighted MRI data were acquired to determine muscle cross-sectional areas (CSA) and to assess fat infiltration into muscle tissue. Except for pH, both age groups showed similar load-induced MR changes and rates of perceived exertion (RPE), which indicates comparable behavior of muscle activation at moderate loads. Changes of mfMRI parameters were significantly associated with RPE in both cohorts. Age-related differences were observed, with lower pH and higher Pi/ATP ratios as well as lower D and f values in the late-middle-aged subjects. These findings are ascribed to age-related changes of fiber type composition, fiber size and vascularity. Interestingly, post exercise f was negatively associated with fat infiltration with the latter being significantly higher in late-middle-aged subjects. CSA of low back muscles remained unchanged, while CSA of inner back muscle as well as mean T2 at rest were associated with maximum force capacity. Overall, applying the proposed MR approach provides evidence of age-related changes in several muscle tissue characteristics and gives new insights into the physiological processes that take place during aging.",

     "abstract": "Dietary methionine restriction (MetR) has been reported to improve hepatocyte function in mammals. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study was conducted with a swine model to test the hypothesis that MetR decreases generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and attenuates oxidative damage in hepatic mitochondria. Twenty-four 35-day old pigs were fed a control diet or a Met-restricted diet for two weeks. Liver mitochondria were isolated to determine: 8-oxodG in mitochondrial DNA, oxidative-derived proteins markers, including glutamic semialdehyde (GSA), aminoadipic semialdehydes (AASA), carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL), carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and malondialdehyde lysine (MDAL), mitochondrial H2O2 generation rate; rates of oxygen consumption; free radical leak (FRL); anti-oxidative capacity, electron transport complex activity; and protein abundances of respiratory chain complex subunits (NDUFA9, SDHA, Core 2, and Cox 1), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Compared with the control, MetR decreased mitochondrial 8-oxodG content, H2O2 generation, FRL (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and increased rates of oxygen consumption. Abundances of markers for protein oxidative damage, including GSA, AASA, CEL, and CML, were decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) by 40%, 30%, 32%, and 28%, respectively, compared with the control. Western blot analysis revealed that MetR decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) the protein abundances of complex subunits, NDUFA9 and AIF without affecting expression of SDHA, Core 2, Cox 1 or MnSOD. The complex I activity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were lowered in MetR group as compared with that of control. Collectively, our findings indicate that dietary MetR decreases mitochondrial ROS generation primarily via inhibiting complex I activity and ROS generation rather than augmenting anti-oxidative capacity, thereby ameliorating oxidative damage to hepatic mitochondrial DNA and proteins.",

     "abstract": "Conventional invertebrate models of aging have provided striking examples for the influence of food- and nutrient-sensing on lifespan and stress resilience. On the other hand, studies in highly social insects, such as honey bees, have revealed how social context can shape very plastic life-history traits, for example flexible aging dynamics in the helper caste (workers). It is, however, not understood how food perception and stress resilience are connected in honey bee workers with different social task behaviors and aging dynamics.To explore this linkage, we tested if starvation resilience, which normally declines with age, depends on food responsiveness in honey bees. We studied two typically non-senesced groups of worker bees with different social task behaviors: mature nurses (caregivers) and mature foragers (food collectors). In addition, we included a group of old foragers for which functional senescence is well-established. Bees were individually scored for their food perception by measuring the gustatory response to different sucrose concentrations. Subsequently, individuals were tested for survival under starvation stress.We found that starvation stress resilience, but not gustatory responsiveness differed between workers with different social task behaviors (mature nurses vs. mature foragers). In addition starvation stress resilience differed between foragers with different aging progressions (mature foragers vs. old foragers). Control experiments confirmed that differences in starvation resilience between mature nurses and mature foragers were robust against changing experimental conditions, such as water provision and activity. For all worker groups we established that individuals with low gustatory responsiveness were more resilient to starvation stress. Finally, for the group of rapidly aging foragers we found that low food responsiveness was linked to a delayed age-related decline in starvation resilience.Our study highlights associations between reduced food perception, increased survival capacity and delayed aging in highly social honey bees. We discuss that these associations may involve canonical internal nutrient sensing pathways, which are shared between honey bees and animal models with less plastic aging dynamics.",

HF is an acute stress that triggers a state of inflammation which may affect immune responses and physical recovery.Longitudinal study of the impact of HF on the functions of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in elderly subjects. Data were recorded prior to surgery, 6\u00a0weeks and 6\u00a0months later.PMN functions were severely impaired shortly after HF (chemotaxis, phagocytosis, superoxide production) but there was a time-related recovery of some PMN functions (chemotaxis, phagocytosis) over time, except in the case of superoxide production. Whereas Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) expression remained unchanged, Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16) increased from low values before surgery to levels of controls 6\u00a0months post-surgery. This was also the case for the C5a complement receptor and CD11b. TLR2 and TLR4 expressions were unchanged. Cytokine and chemokine secretions by stimulated PMN were altered. TNF\u03b1 and IL-10 secretions were increased following HF but IL-8 secretion was decreased. Impaired PMN functions prior to surgery were related to alterations in PI3K and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Recovery of these functions paralleled increased PI3K activity, although superoxide production remained low. Sustained activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway by TNF\u03b1 has been reported to involve upregulation of IKK\u03b2 kinase activity. Activated IKK\u03b2 kinase inhibits ERK1/2 and results in concomitant downstream inhibition of NADPH oxidase complex which can account for sustained impaired production of ROS in HF patients.Our data showed that the stress caused by HF negatively affects initial PMN responses shortly after the event and that may negatively influence clinical outcomes such as resolving long-term inflammation and recovery, as well as explaining susceptibility to opportunistic infections.",

     "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurobiology could not be explained solely by an increase in \u03b2-amyloid levels. Recently, it has been proposed that alterations in brain cholesterol metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. In the present work, we focus on early changes in the hippocampal phenotypes of two mouse models in which cognitive impairments were previously described: a) the hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout (LDLr \u2212/\u2212) and b) the APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic model of familial AD. Our initial analysis, subsequent validation and additional experiments at the mRNA and protein levels demonstrate some parallels between the hippocampal phenotypes of these 2 mouse models, however our data suggest that the molecular mechanisms leading to cognitive decline are distinct in LDLr \u2212/\u2212 and APP/PS1 animals. Genes related to cytokine signaling were significantly down-regulated in LDLr \u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to both the wild-type and APP/PS1 mice, and these include prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthases 1 and 2 (ptgs1 and 2) and nerve grow factor (ngf). We have also detected reduced expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in LDLr \u2212/\u2212 mice: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (pparg), pro-opiomelanocortin-alpha (pomc) and of protein kinase, AMP-activated, alpha 1 catalytic subunit of AMPK (prkaa1). Our array data also indicate that transcriptional activity of early genes involved in memory process, such as FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos) and the activity regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) gene, are increased in the hippocampus of LDLr \u2212/\u2212 mice. Several proteins like insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), PGC-1\u03b1, OXPHOS 1, NMDAR1 and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) are up-regulated in the LDLr \u2212/\u2212 mice, while in the APP/PS1 mouse model only OXPHOS complexes 2, 3 and 5 are slightly downregulated.

Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded for the flexor and extensor carpi radialis during movement preparation of wrist flexion and extension as well as during rest. We found that MEPs were less specifically facilitated during planning in older as compared to younger adults, as indicated by an Age\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Condition\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Muscle interaction. Young participants showed significantly facilitated MEPs in the respective muscle needed for wrist flexion or extension. By contrast MEPs in older participants were less specifically modulated. We conclude that age relates to dedifferentiated activation of the primary motor cortex already during preparation of distinct movements which might contribute to less efficient motor control in older adults.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether intracerebroventricular injection of GalR1 agonist M617 would elevate GLUT4 expression in the cardiac muscle of type 2 diabetic rats. The rats tested were divided into four groups: rats from healthy and type 2 diabetic drug groups were injected with 10\u00a0nM/kg/d M617 in 5\u00a0\u03bcl artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 21\u00a0days, while control received 5\u00a0\u03bcl vehicle injections. The blood samples were analyzed for glucose and insulin concentration. Cardiac muscle was collected and processed for determination of GLUT4 mRNA expression and GLUT4 protein levels. The present findings showed that fasting blood glucose levels in both M617 treatment groups were lower compared with each control. The insulin levels in both M617 treatment groups were decreased compared with each control. Moreover, the GLUT4 content in the cardiac muscle in both drug groups was higher compared with each control. M617 treatment increased GLUT4 mRNA expression and GLUT4 protein levels compared with each control group. These observations suggest that GalR1 agonist M617, acting through its central GalR1, can promote GLUT4 expression and enhance GLUT4 content in the cardiac muscle of type 2 diabetic rats. Central GalR1 may play a significant role in regulation of glucose metabolic homeostasis in the cardiac muscle of type 2 diabetic rats.",

     "abstract": "A progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and force generating capacity occurs with aging. Mice are commonly used in the study of aging-associated changes in muscle size and strength, with most models of aging demonstrating 15\u201335% reductions in muscle mass, cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum isometric force production (Po) and specific force (sPo), which is Po/CSA. The lumbrical muscle of the mouse forepaw is exceptionally small, with corresponding short diffusion distances that make it ideal for in vitro pharmacological studies and measurements of contractile properties. However, the aging-associated changes in lumbrical function have not previously been reported. To address this, we tested the hypothesis that compared to adult (12\u00a0month old) mice, the forepaw lumbrical muscles of old (30\u00a0month old) mice exhibit aging-related declines in size and force production similar to those observed in larger limb muscles. We found that the forepaw lumbricals were composed exclusively of fibers with type II myosin heavy chain isoforms, and that the muscles accumulated connective tissue with aging. There were no differences in the number of fibers per whole-muscle cross-section or in muscle fiber CSA. The whole muscle CSA in old mice was increased by 17%, but the total CSA of all muscle fibers in a whole-muscle cross-section was not different. No difference in Po was observed, and while sPo normalized to total muscle CSA was decreased in old mice by 22%, normalizing Po by the total muscle fiber CSA resulted in no difference in sPo. Combined, these results indicate that forepaw lumbrical muscles from 30\u00a0month old mice are largely protected from the aging-associated declines in size and force production that are typically observed in larger limb muscles.",

     "abstract": "During aging the ability of organisms to maintain the protein homeostasis declines and damaged and misfolded proteins accumulate in cells. But whether the deterioration of protein homeostasis is the cause or consequence of aging is not clearly understood. Mitochondrial dysfunctions usually lead to increased longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans, the cause of which is believed to be the activation of protein homeostasis protective mechanisms including mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and GCN-2 kinase mediated nutrient-sensing pathway. However, we investigated four genes which encode well-defined mitochondrial proteins and found that: (i) UPRmt activation was associated with not only increased longevity by knockdown of mfn-1, cco-1, or nuo-6, but also decreased longevity by mev-1 RNAi; (ii) The blockage of UPRmt pathway did not repress mfn-1, cco-1, or nuo-6 RNAi induced lifespan extension; (iii) The activation of UPRmt did not increase longevity; (iv) Knockdown of mfn-1, cco-1, or nuo-6 increased longevity independently of GCN-2. The combined results indicate that two important kinds of the protein homeostasis protective mechanisms, namely UPRmt and GCN-2 pathways, are not responsible for mitochondrial deficiency induced lifespan extension. The enhanced protection of protein homeostasis may be insufficient to slow aging, and there may be other mechanisms that contribute to the increased longevity in response to mitochondrial dysfunctions.",

     "abstract": "In this perspective article, we review the effects of selected anabolic hormones on the motoric system and speculate on the role these hormones may have on influencing muscle and physical function via their impact on the nervous system. Both muscle strength and anabolic hormone levels decline around middle age into old age over a similar time period, and several animal and human studies indicate that exogenously increasing anabolic hormones (e.g., testosterone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)) in aged subjects is positively associated with improved muscle strength. While most studies in humans have focused on the effects of anabolic hormones on muscle growth, few have considered the impact these hormones have on the motoric system. However, data from animals demonstrate that administering either testosterone or IGF-1 to cells of the central and peripheral motor system can increase cell excitability, attenuate atrophic changes, and improve regenerative capacity of motor neurons. While these studies do not directly indicate that changes in anabolic hormones contribute to reduced human performance in the elderly (e.g., muscle weakness and physical limitations), they do suggest that additional research is warranted along these lines.",

Here, we investigate the progression of proinflammatory markers in liver during aging and the effect of RSV on inflammation markers in the liver of old male C57BL/6J mice. Young (2\u00a0months), mature (12\u00a0months) and old (18\u00a0months) mice were fed during 6\u00a0months with RSV. Levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 were evaluated by ELISA in mice liver. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 and also their respective mRNA increased in the liver from old mice. However, RSV decreased these levels in the case of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 but only in old mice showing no effect on young and mature animals. This reduction was also found at the mRNA level. Levels of mRNA of the components of NALP-3 inflammasome, ASC, CASP-1, NALP-1 and NALP-3, also showed an age-dependent increase that was reversed by RSV. Furthermore, cyclooxygenase 2 levels, a marker of proinflammatory innate immune activity, were also upregulated in aged liver and reversed again by RSV. In conclusion, our study confirms that aging is accompanied by an increase in the proinflammatory pattern in the liver and that RSV reduces this pattern in old mice liver.",

Male Brown Norway Fisher 344 rats at 6 (young) and 32 (old) months of age were subjected to normal ambulatory conditions (amb), hind limb suspension for 14\u00a0days (HS), and HS followed by reloading through normal ambulation for 14\u00a0days (RE); soleus muscles were used for analysis of intracellular signaling pathways and cellular processes. Soleus muscle regrowth was blunted in old compared to young rats which coincided with a recovery of serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels in young but not old. However, the response to reloading for p-Akt, p-p70s6k and p-GSK3\u03b2 protein abundance was similar between muscles from young and old rats, even though main effects for age indicate an increase in activation of this protein synthesis pathway in the aged. Similarly, MAFbx mRNA levels in soleus muscle from old rats recovered to the same extent as in the young, while Murf-1 was unchanged. mRNA abundance of autophagy markers Atg5 and Atg7 showed an identical response in muscle from old compared to young rats, but beclin did not. Autophagic flux was not changed at either age at the measured time point. Apoptosis was elevated in soleus muscle from old rats particularly with HS, but recovered in HSRE and these changes were not associated with differences in caspase-3, -8 or -9 activity in any group. Protein abundance of apoptosis repressor with caspase-recruitment domain (ARC), cytosolic EndoG, as well as cytosolic and nuclear apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) were lower in muscle from old rats, and there was no age-related difference in the response to atrophy or regrowth. Soleus muscles from old rats had a higher number of ED2 positive macrophages in all groups and these decreased with HS, but recovered in HSRE in the old, while no changes were observed in the young. Pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum did not show a differential response with age to different loading conditions. Results indicate that at the measured time point the impaired skeletal muscle regrowth after atrophy in aged animals is not associated with a general lack of responsiveness to changes in loading conditions.",

Additionally, elderly women were screened for sarcopenia using the algorithm of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (low muscle mass in addition to low PTE and/or low walking speed).IGF-1 levels were higher and GDF-15 levels were lower in young females in comparison to the elderly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), whereas members of the activin A/myostatin/follistatin axis showed similar levels across age groups.

FGF-2 (5\u00a0ng) and BMP-2 (2\u00a0\u03bcg) were administered by a controlled release two-phase biomaterial scaffold placed into the bone defect. FGF-2 released more rapidly and completely in vitro than BMP-2 (40% vs 2%).

The overall total volume of new bone was not statistically increased by the addition of FGF-2 to BMP-2 as measured by microCT, but the pattern of bone deposition was different. In old mice, but not young, there was enhanced bony fill in the central bone defect area when the BMP-2 was supplemented with FGF-2. Histological analysis of the center of the defect revealed an increased bone volume (%BV/TV (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004)) from the addition of FGF-2.

DXA was used to estimate abdominal fat mass (AFM) by placing the region of interest over the L1\u2013L4 region of the spine. Outcomes were assessed by ANCOVA, with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons. Baseline AFM values were used as the covariate. The ANCOVA indicated a significant difference (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013) between group means for the adjusted posttest AFM values (mean (kg)\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE: NT-PL\u00a0=\u00a02.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06; NT-HMB\u00a0=\u00a02.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61; RT-PL\u00a0=\u00a02.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62; RT-HMB\u00a0=\u00a02.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61).

Recently adiponectin protein has been reported in murine vascular endothelial cells, however, whether adiponectin is present in human vascular endothelial cells remains unexplored. We sought to examine 1) adiponectin protein in vascular endothelial cells collected from older adults free of overt cardiovascular disease; 2) the relation between endothelial cell adiponectin and in vivo vascular endothelial function; and 3) the relation between endothelial cell adiponectin, circulating (plasma) adiponectin and related factors. We measured vascular endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation using ultrasonography), vascular endothelial cell adiponectin (biopsy coupled with quantitative immunofluorescence) and circulating adiponectin (Mercodia, ELISA) in older, sedentary, non-smoking, men and women (55\u201379\u00a0years). We found that higher endothelial cell adiponectin was related with greater flow-mediated dilation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.43, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and greater flow-mediated dilation normalized for shear stress (r\u00a0=\u00a00.56, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but was not related with vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to nitric oxide (r\u00a0=\u00a00.04, P\u00a0=\u00a00.9). Vascular endothelial cell adiponectin was not related with circulating adiponectin (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.14, P\u00a0=\u00a00.6). Endothelial cell and circulating adiponectin were differentially associated with adiposity, metabolic and other factors, but both were inversely associated with renal function (r\u00a0=\u00a00.44 to 0.62, P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.04).

     "abstract": "For biological systems, balancing cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is of great importance because ROS are both, essential for cellular signaling and dangerous in causing molecular damage. Cellular ROS abundance is controlled by a delicate network of molecular pathways. Within this network, superoxide dismutases (SODs) are active in disproportion of the superoxide anion leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. The fungal aging model Podospora anserina encodes at least three SODs. One of these is the mitochondrial PaSOD3 isoform containing manganese as a cofactor. Previous work resulted in the selection of strains in which PaSod3 is strongly overexpressed. These strains display impairments in growth and lifespan. A computational model suggests a series of events to occur in Sod3 overexpressing strains leading to adverse effects due to elevated hydrogen peroxide levels. In an attempt to validate this model and to obtain more detailed information about the cellular responses involved in ROS balancing, we further investigated the PaSod3 overexpressing strains. Here we show that hydrogen peroxide levels are indeed strongly increased in the mutant strain. Surprisingly, this phenotype can be rescued by the addition of manganese to the growth medium. Strikingly, while we obtained no evidence for an antioxidant effect of manganese, we found that the metal is required for induction of components of the ROS scavenging network and lowers the hydrogen peroxide level of the mutant. A similar effect of manganese on lifespan reversion was obtained in wild-type strains challenged with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. It appears that manganese is limited under high hydrogen peroxide and suggests that a manganese-dependent activity leads to the induction of ROS scavenging components.",

Encapsulated SVF was implanted subcutaneously into young Rag1 mice for two or four weeks. Angiogenic function of age-dependent SVF was also extensively evaluated in vitro using standard assays.In vitro studies indicated no difference in angiogenic function between ySVF and oSVF (viability, proliferation, migration, and tube-formation). At two weeks post-implantation, there was no age-related difference in percent apoptosis in explanted constructs. By four weeks post-implantation, oSVF implants displayed 36% less total vessels/mm2, 43% less perfused vessels/mm2, and exhibited greater percent apoptosis compared to ySVF (n\u00a0\u2265\u00a012). Blocking thrombospondin-1 (Thbs-1), a protein found to be highly expressed in oSVF but not ySVF, increased the percent of perfused vascular volume and vessel diameters in oSVF constructs after two weeks compared to oSVF implants treated with control antibody.Advancing donor age reduces the potential of adipose-derived SVF to derive a mature microcirculation, but does not hinder initial angiogenesis. However, modulation of Thbs-1 may improve this outcome. This data suggests that greater pruning, dysfunctional structural adaptation and/or poor maturation with initiation of blood flow may occur in oSVF.",

WBVT consisted of four leg exercises three times weekly. Aortic (cfPWV) and leg (faPWV) PWV, leg LM index, leg strength, and body fat percentage (BF%) were measured before and after the interventions.

Fourier transform infrared imaging and high resolution synchrotron scanning small angle X-ray scattering were used to study how bone's microscale and nanoscale compositional properties were altered in the tibial midshaft of young, adult, and elderly female C57Bl/6J mice after two weeks of controlled in vivo compressive loading in comparison to physiological loading. The effect of controlled loading on bone composition varied with animal age, since it predominantly influenced the bone composition of elderly mice. Interestingly, controlled loading led to enhanced collagen maturity in elderly mice. In addition, although the rate of bone formation was increased by controlled loading based on histomorphometry, the newly formed tissue had similar material quality to the new bone tissue formed during physiological loading. Similar to previous studies, our data showed that bone composition was animal age- and tissue age-dependent during physiological loading. The findings that the new tissue formed in response to controlled loading and physiological loading had similar bone composition and that controlled loading enhanced bone composition in elderly mice further support the use of physical activity as a noninvasive treatment to enhance bone quality as well as maintain bone mass in individuals suffering from age-related bone loss.",

Recently, we suggested that CR for 6\u00a0months increased the expressions of proteins involved in de novo fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis in WAT of 9-month-old rats. Herein, we compared the CR-induced chronological alterations of the expression of mRNAs and/or proteins involved in FA biosynthesis in the WAT and liver of rats subjected to CR starting from 3\u00a0months of age and their age-matched controls fed ad libitum. The findings suggested that CR was more effective on FA biosynthesis in WAT than in liver. In WAT, CR markedly increased the expressions of mRNAs and/or proteins involved in FA biosynthesis, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), a master transcriptional regulator of FA biosynthesis, throughout the experimental period. Interestingly, the CR-enhanced upregulation was temporally attenuated at 5\u00a0months of age. CR markedly increased the nuclear phosphorylated form of Akt only at 3.5\u00a0months of age. In contrast, CR significantly reduced the expression of leptin at 9\u00a0months of age. The CR-induced upregulation was not observed in obese fa/fa Zucker rats homozygous for nonfunctional leptin receptor. Collectively, these data indicate that the V-shaped chronological alterations in WAT are regulated via SREBP1c, which is probably activated by CR duration-dependent modulation of both insulin and leptin signaling.",

The expression of anti-oxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) was suppressed whereas the pro-oxidative enzyme NADPH oxidase (NOX4) and mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK 1/2 and p38 were increased at different tissues. Treatment with soy (SIF, 150\u00a0mg/kg BW for 12\u00a0weeks) extract markedly reversed these metabolic changes and improved OS. Ovariectomized rats also displayed glucose intolerance (GI) and IR as evident from the impaired glucose tolerance test, and reduced expression of adipose and hepatic insulin receptor beta (IR\u03b2) and adipose tissue GLUT4. Treatment with SIF reversed the ovariectomy induced GI and IR. On the other hand, all these metabolic changes were further augmented when ovariectomy was followed by a high fat diet, and these changes were also reversed by SIF. Taken together, these findings emphasized the antioxidant property and anti-diabetic effects of soy isoflavones suggesting the use of this natural phytoestrogen as a strategy for relieving oxidative stress and insulin resistance in postmenopausal women.",

Subjects with severe WML were older, had lower mobility, and had greater brain atrophy than subjects with mild WML (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Identifying sensitive diagnostic biomarkers of responsiveness to RT may inform the design of a more efficient exercise regimen to improve muscle strength in older adults. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. We quantified six muscle specific miRNAs (miR-1, -133a, -133b, -206, -208b and -499) in both muscle tissue and blood plasma, and their relationship with knee extensor strength in seven older (age\u00a0=\u00a070.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0years) adults before and after 5\u00a0months of RT. MiRNAs differentially responded to RT; muscle miR-133b decreased, while all plasma miRNAs tended to increase. Percent changes in knee extensor strength with RT showed strong positive correlations with percent changes in muscle miR-133a, -133b, and -206 and with percent changes in plasma and plasma/muscle miR-499 ratio. Baseline level of plasma or plasma/muscle miR-499 ratio further predicts muscle response to RT, while changes in muscle miR-133a, -133b, and -206 may correlate with muscle TNNT1 gene alternative splicing in response to RT. Our results indicate that RT alters muscle specific miRNAs in muscle and plasma, and that these changes account for some of the variation in strength responses to RT in older adults.",

After treatment, whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and the Equation K value of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESRK) decreased significantly in the Yerba mate group. Meanwhile, shape, flow state and nailfold microcirculation appeared positively changed. Specifically, blood flow speeds accelerated gradually and nailfold weighted integral values decreased significantly. Moreover, the vasodilator 6-keto PGF1\u03b1 increased while the thromboxane TXB2 decreased in serum samples of subjects in the Yerba mate-receiving group. Overall, Yerba mate tea-receiving subjects saw nearly all measured values improve to levels comparable to those characteristic of patients with normal microcirculation.These results indicate the therapeutic capacity of Yerba mate tea in the treatment of high blood viscosity. Here, Yerba mate tea played a role in the regulation of various indexes of hemorheology, nailfold microcirculation, and the platelet aggregating factors 6-keto-PGF1a and TXB2. The regulation of these might be correlated with reduced blood viscosity and accelerating blood flow. Thus, Yerba mate tea may reduce some key risk-factors of cardiovascular disease. Daily consumption of Yerba mate tea may be a better-tolerated option for individuals with high blood viscosity and microcirculatory disturbance and as such, a novel preventative strategy for patients at-risk for vascular disease.",

Muscles from old mice had a lower SC density than adult muscles (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

Resveratrol did not rescue the hypertrophic response and even reduced, rather than increased, the number of SCs in hypertrophied muscles.",

     "abstract": "Elderly patients represent a high risk category among subjects with atherosclerosis, due to the presence of comorbidities and suboptimal response to antiplatelet drugs. Mean platelet volume (MPV) has been indicated as a marker of platelet reactivity, with contrasting data on its role on coronary artery disease. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of age on the MPV and its role on the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD).Our population is represented by a cohort of 3750 patients undergoing coronary angiography. Elderly were defined according to age\u00a0\u2265\u00a075\u00a0years. MPV was measured at admission. Significant coronary artery disease was defined as a stenosis >\u00a050% in at least 1 coronary vessel, while severe CAD was defined as left main and/or three-vessel disease.A total of 1170 out of 3750 (31.2%) patients were \u2265\u00a075\u00a0years old. Advanced age was associated with female gender (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), hypertension (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), renal failure (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), previous myocardial infarction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) coronary artery bypass grafting (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) indication to angiography (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), therapy with angiotension-receptor blockers, (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), nitrates, diuretics and calcium-antagonists (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), serum creatinine (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), fibrinogen (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and C reactive protein (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), but inversely to percutaneous coronary interventions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), dyslipidemia, family history of CAD and smoking (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively), use of statins (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and beta blockers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), haemoglobin, total cholesterol and triglycerides (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively), white blood cells (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) and platelet count (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).Elderly patients displayed a significantly larger platelet volume (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with a direct linear relationship between age and the MPV (r\u00a0=\u00a00.08, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with age being confirmed as an independent predictor of larger MPV (\u2265\u00a010.85\u00a0fl) at multivariate analysis (adjusted OR [95% CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.18 [1.01\u20131.40], p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).Among the elderly, MPV value above the median (\u2265\u00a010.85\u00a0fl) was not associated with a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (77.3 vs. 79.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.39, adjusted OR [95% CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.94 [0.66\u20131.33], p\u00a0=\u00a00.71), or higher prevalence of severe CAD (35.2 vs. 32.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.28, adjusted OR [95% CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.34 [0.99\u20131.82], p\u00a0=\u00a00.06).Advanced age was directly associated with larger mean platelet volume that, however, did not contribute to explain the higher prevalence and extent of coronary artery disease observed in elderly patients.",

However, its mechanism of action is not well understood. This study was conducted to identify the active fraction of Eclipta, its toxicity, its effect on hyperlipidemia, and its mechanism of action. The ethanol extract (EP) of Eclipta and fractions EPF1\u2013EPF4, obtained by eluting with different concentrations of ethanol from a HPD-450 macroporous resin column chromatography of the EP, were screened in hyperlipidemic mice for lipid-lowering activity, and EPF3 was the most active fraction. The LD50 of EPF3 was undetectable because no mice died with administration of EPF3 at 10.4\u00a0g/kg. Then, 48 male hamsters were used and randomly assigned to normal chow diet, high-fat diet, high-fat diet with Xuezhikang (positive control) or EPF3 (75, 150 and 250\u00a0mg/kg) groups. We evaluated the effects of EPF3 on body weight gain, liver weight gain, serum lipid concentration, antioxidant enzyme activity, and the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic hamsters. The results showed that EPF3 significantly decreased body-weight gain and liver-weight gain and reduced the serum lipid levels in hyperlipidemic hamsters. EPF3 also increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes; up-regulated the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), lecithin-cholesterol transferase (LCAT) and scavenger receptor class B type \u0399 receptor (SR-BI); and down-regulated the mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) in the liver. These results indicate that EPF3 ameliorates hyperlipidemia, in part, by reducing oxidative stress and modulating the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism.",

Considering this, the purpose of this study was to investigate how age and lifestyle may affect DNA damage, DNA repair capacity and endogenous biomarkers of oxidative stress. Sixty-one healthy men (40 to 89\u00a0yrs) were enrolled in this study. The results showed that DNA strand breaks (DNA SBs) and DNA repair capacity were greater in the older group (>\u00a0=\u00a065\u00a0yrs) compared to the younger group (<\u00a065\u00a0yrs) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). FPG-sensitive sites, total antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation (MDA) were not statistically different between groups. The correlation test showed that DNA damage variables were not correlated with any lifestyle variable excepting DNA SBs which was correlated with aerobic capacity (6MWT). DNA SBs and DNA repair were positively correlated with age. The multiple regression analysis revealed that the aerobic capacity (6MWT) and MDA were the predictors for the variation of DNA SBs (41.9%). In conclusion these results suggest that DNA SB damage increases with age but not FPG-sensitive sites. Moreover, base excision repair capacity increases with age without the increase of oxidative damage to DNA. The most predictable variables of DNA SBs were the aerobic capacity and MDA.",

Atherosclerosis is a disease in which frequency increases with age. The first lesions appear at the young subject during adolescence. Atherosclerosis lesions appear very precociously and worsen with age. They interest the levels chronologically aortic, coronary then carotid. Age is a risk factor in that it reflects the exposure time of individual to the other risk factors. The frequency of the atherosclerosis increases with age because of the aging of the cells. This study was undertaken to evaluate the hypolipidemic and anti-atherosclerotic properties of aqueous extract of the leaves of F. glumosa in rats with hypercholesterolemia (HC). 60 male rats were fed for 4\u00a0weeks with a high-cholesterol diet (1%) and 3 doses (225, 300 and 375\u00a0mg/kg) of extract of F. glumosa were used in these experiments. The experiments were conducted under the same conditions with atorvastatin (1\u00a0mg/kg), as pharmacological reference substance. The effects of F. glumosa on weight gain, water and food consumption, levels of serum lipids and lipoprotein lipid oxidation and stress markers in the blood and liver were examined. The administration of F. glumosa extract prevented significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) elevation in TC, LDL-c, VLDL-c, hepatic and aortic TG and TC. The atherogenic, triglyceride, and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) indexes were also decreased in the rats treated with the extract. F. glumosa favored the performance of fecal cholesterol. It also significantly inhibited the changes and the formation of aortic atherosclerotic plaques. These results revealed the hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerotic effects of F. glumosa extract and support the traditional use of the extract of this plant in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes.",

Ten femoral heads from female patients with femoral neck fractures were extracted during surgery (five for the Aged group, aged 65\u201366\u00a0years; five for the Advanced aged group, aged 85\u201395\u00a0years). The femoral head was divided into three equal layers (anterior, central, and posterior) in the coronal view, and each layer was segmented into five regions (superior, central, inferior, medial, and lateral). Nanoindentation testing and atomic force microscopy imaging were used to study the mechanical properties and surface morphology of the specimens. No statistical differences in grain size were found between age groups, which suggested that the nanostructure of trabeculae in the femoral heads of postmenopausal women cannot be used to predict age-related bone loss and fracture risk. Mechanical properties in the longitudinal direction deteriorated more quickly than those in the transverse direction for the whole femoral head. Comparisons between layers showed a higher deterioration rate with aging in the anterior layer than in other layers. In different regions, mechanical properties of the medial and lateral regions deteriorated more quickly than those in the three other regions, and deterioration in the longitudinal direction was more serious than that in the transverse direction. The regional deterioration patterns and material properties with aging observed in this study contribute to an understanding of the age-related fracture mechanism and provide a basis for predicting age-related fracture risk and decreasing early fixation failure in the proximal femur.",

     "abstract": "Blood thyroid function tests (TFT) are routinely used to screen for thyroid disorders in several clinical settings. TFT on hospital admission may also be useful prognostic predictors of acute IS: according to recent evidence, poststroke outcome is better in patients with lower thyroid function and worse in those with higher thyroid function. However, previous reports are few and mostly compared patients with thyroid disorders to euthyroid patients. Thyroid disorders are known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. However, hyperthyroidism is related to cardioembolic IS whereas hypothyroidism is related to atherosclerotic risk factors. Therefore, findings from available studies of TFT might just reflect the worse prognosis of cardioembolic IS compared to other IS subtypes. Another limitation of previous studies is the lack of information for older persons, who represent three quarters of all IS patients. In this paper, we investigated whether serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) measured on Stroke Unit (SU) admission are associated with early outcomes of acute IS in 775 euthyroid patients aged \u2265\u00a065\u00a0years (mean age 80.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7\u00a0years). Two composite outcomes were investigated: poor functional outcome (death during SU stay or disability at SU discharge), and unfavorable discharge setting (death during SU stay, transfer from SU to other acute hospital unit or transfer from SU to long-term care-facilities as opposed to direct discharge home). Analyses were performed using logistic regression models. Curvilinear associations were tested including TFT as polynomial terms. Models were adjusted for demographics, prestroke, and IS-related confounders. We found that lower TSH had a complex curvilinear association with poor functional outcome and that the shape of the associations changed with age. At age 65, the curve was U-shaped: outcome risk decreased with increasing TSH, reached its minimum at TSH near 3.00\u00a0mUI/L and then started to rise. Between ages 70 and 75, however, the shape of the curve straightened and, starting from age 80 took an inverted U-shape: outcome risk rose with increasing TSH, reached its maximum at TSH values that progressively shifted upward with increasing age (from 1.70\u00a0mU/L at age 80 to about 2.20\u00a0mUI/L at age 90), then started to decrease. A linear inverse association was found between FT3 and unfavorable discharge setting. Our study suggests that measurement of TFT on SU admission can provide independent prognostic information for early outcomes of acute IS in older euthyroid patients.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion mutations are proposed contributors to aging-related muscle fiber loss and atrophy, but evidence of a causal role for these mutations in muscle aging is lacking. Elucidating the etiology of in vivo mtDNA deletion mutations will help to better understand and test the possible roles of these mutations in aging. The implication of mtDNA mutations in aging is based on the susceptibility of mtDNA to oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to residing in mitochondria, the primary source of endogenous ROS. Cells possess many pathways for neutralizing ROSs, including a variety of superoxide dismutases (SOD). Mice lacking CuZnSOD (Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice) have high levels of oxidative damage in many tissues including skeletal muscle and are a model for testing the role of oxidative damage in the formation of mtDNA deletion mutations. The increased DNA oxidative damage in Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice is associated with increased mtDNA deletion mutations in a variety of tissues, but skeletal muscle mtDNA mutations have not been reported. We hypothesized that a life-long absence of mouse muscle CuZnSOD would increase mtDNA deletion mutation frequency and focal accumulation of these mutations in aging mouse skeletal muscle. Focal accumulations of mtDNA deletion mutations were detected by histochemical staining for cytochrome c oxidase (cytOX) activity and detection of cytOX-negative fibers, a marker of focal mtDNA mutation accumulation, within approximately 20,000 muscle fibers through a distance of 1000\u00a0\u03bcm. Total DNA was extracted from intervening unstained sections and mtDNA deletion mutation frequency was measured by a droplet digital PCR. Droplet digital PCR quantification of mtDNA deletion mutations showed no difference in mtDNA deletion mutation frequency in Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mouse muscle compared to wild-type mice and we observed no significant increase in the number of cytOX-negative muscle fibers, in Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that not all changes in cellular oxidative stress are linked to mtDNA deletion mutations and shift the focus to other etiologies for these mutations that need to be clarified to better test their possible role in aging.",

On the contrary, lower concentrations of ethanol (0.86\u201368\u00a0mM) have been shown to cause a two- to three-fold increase in the life span of animals in the stress resistant L1 larval stage in the absence of a food source. However, little is known about how gene and protein expression is altered by low concentrations of ethanol and the mechanism for the increased longevity. Therefore, we used biochemical assays and next generation mRNA sequencing to identify genes and biological pathways altered by ethanol. RNA-seq analysis of L1 larvae incubated in the presence of 17\u00a0mM ethanol resulted in the significant differential expression of 649 genes, 274 of which were downregulated and 375 were upregulated. Many of the genes significantly altered were associated with the conversion of ethanol and triglycerides to acetyl-CoA and glucose, suggesting that ethanol is serving as an energy source in the increased longevity of the L1 larvae as well as a signal for fat utilization. We also asked if L1 larvae could sense ethanol and respond by directed movement. Although we found that L1 larvae can chemotax to benzaldehyde, we observed little or no chemotaxis to ethanol. Understanding how low concentrations of ethanol increase the lifespan of L1 larvae may provide insight into not only the longevity pathways in C. elegans, but also in those of higher organisms.",

In this study, we compared the prevalence of sarcopenia assessed using different diagnostic tools.To measure muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance, we used for each outcome two different diagnostic tools. For muscle mass, we used Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA); for muscle strength, we used a hydraulic dynamometer and a pneumatic dynamometer; for physical performance we used the Short Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB test) and the walk speed. Eight diagnostic groups were hereby established.A total of 250 consecutive subjects were recruited in an outpatient clinic in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. Estimated prevalence of sarcopenia varied from 8.4% to 27.6% depending on the method of diagnosis used. Regarding muscle mass, BIA systematically overestimated muscle mass compared to DXA (mean estimated prevalence with BIA\u00a0=\u00a012.8%; mean prevalence with DXA\u00a0=\u00a021%). For muscle strength, the pneumatic dynamometer diagnosed twice more sarcopenic subjects than the hydraulic dynamometer (mean estimated prevalence with PD\u00a0=\u00a022.4%; mean estimated prevalence with HD\u00a0=\u00a011.4%). Finally, no difference in prevalence was observed when the walking speed or the SPPB test was used. A weak overall kappa coefficient was observed (0.53), suggesting that the 8 methods of diagnosis are moderately concordant.Within the same definition of sarcopenia, prevalence of sarcopenia is highly dependent on the diagnostic tools used.",

Maximal strength of lower leg muscles and centre of pressure (CoP) steadiness during upright stance in various sensory conditions were measured before and after training. The input\u2013output relation of motor evoked potential (MEP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation and H reflex was also assessed in soleus during upright standing. The maximal strength of the ankle plantar flexor muscles increased after training programmes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with a trend for greater gain in ST (+\u00a035.7%) compared with BT (+\u00a020.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.055). The gain in strength was positively correlated with the increase in voluntary activation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Both training programmes decreased maximal amplitude and mean fluctuations of CoP displacements recorded in the backward\u2013forward direction when standing on a foam mat (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but not on a rigid surface. The electromyographic activity of the ankle plantar flexor muscles during upright standing decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after training but not for the tibialis anterior. Results obtained for H reflex and MEP input\u2013output relations suggest an increased efficacy of Ia afferents to activate low-threshold motor neurones and a decrease in corticospinal excitability after training.

     "abstract": "Mosquitoes are one of the most important vectors of human disease. The ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease is dependent on the age structure of the population, as mosquitoes must survive long enough for the parasites to complete their development and infect another human. Age could have additional effects due to mortality rates and vector competence changing as mosquitoes senesce, but these are comparatively poorly understood. We have investigated these factors using the mosquito Aedes aegypti and the filarial nematode Brugia malayi. Rather than observing any effects of immune senescence, we found that older mosquitoes were more resistant, but this only occurred if they had previously been maintained on a nutrient-poor diet of fructose. Constant blood feeding reversed this decline in vector competence, meaning that the number of parasites remained relatively unchanged as mosquitoes aged. Old females that had been maintained on fructose also experienced a sharp spike in mortality after an infected blood meal (\u201crefeeding syndrome\u201d) and few survived long enough for the parasite to develop. Again, this effect was prevented by frequent blood meals. Our results indicate that old mosquitoes may be inefficient vectors due to low vector competence and high mortality, but that frequent blood meals can prevent these effects of age.",

Age-associated muscle deterioration causes loss of strength and may impair fitness of wild animals. However, the effects of age and life-history characteristics on muscle strength in wild animals are unknown. We investigated environment- and sex-specific patterns of physical functioning by measuring grip strength in wild and captive gray mouse lemurs. We expected more pronounced strength senescence in captivity due to condition-dependent, extrinsic mortality found in nature. Males were predicted to be stronger but potentially experience more severe senescence than females as predicted by life history theory. We found similar senescent declines in captive males and females as well as wild females, whereas wild males showed little decline, presumably due to their early mortality. Captive animals were generally weaker and showed earlier declines than wild animals. Unexpectedly, females tended to be stronger than males, especially in the reproductive season. Universal intrinsic mechanisms (e.g. sarcopenia) likely cause the similar patterns of strength loss across settings. The female advantage in muscle strength merits further study; it may follow higher reproductive investment by males, or be an adaptation associated with female social dominance.",

The incidence of and mortality from IPF increase with age, suggesting that advanced age is a major risk factor for IPF. The mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility of the elderly to IPF, however, is unknown. In this study, we show for the first time that the protein level of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a protease inhibitor which plays an essential role in the control of fibrinolysis, was significantly increased with age in mouse lung homogenate and lung fibroblasts. Upon bleomycin challenge, old mice experienced augmented PAI-1 induction and lung fibrosis as compared to young mice. Most interestingly, we show that fewer (myo)fibroblasts underwent apoptosis and more (myo)fibroblasts with increased level of PAI-1 accumulated in the lung of old than in young mice after bleomycin challenge. In vitro studies further demonstrate that fibroblasts isolated from lungs of old mice were resistant to H2O2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis and had augmented fibrotic responses to TGF-\u03b21, compared to fibroblasts isolated from young mice. Inhibition of PAI-1 activity with a PAI-1 inhibitor, on the other hand, eliminated the aging-related apoptosis resistance and TGF-\u03b21 sensitivity in isolated fibroblasts. Moreover, we show that knocking down PAI-1 in human lung fibroblasts with PAI-1 siRNA significantly increased their sensitivity to apoptosis and inhibited their responses to TGF-\u03b21. Together, the results suggest that increased PAI-1 expression may underlie the aging-related sensitivity to lung fibrosis in part by protecting fibroblasts from apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "Aging is generally accompanied by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and impairments in metabolic function. Even a few days of muscle disuse (such as that occurring during injury or illness) leads to considerable loss of muscle mass and strength. It has been speculated that short, successive periods of muscle disuse throughout the lifespan may be largely responsible for the age-related loss of muscle mass. However, it remains unknown whether such short periods of disuse also induce impairments in metabolic function within skeletal muscle. Here, we investigated the effects of a five day period of muscle disuse on intramyocellular triacylglycerol (IMTG) content, muscle oxidative capacity, and the expression of key genes that regulate oxidative metabolism in healthy young and elderly men. Muscle biopsies were collected from healthy, young (n\u00a0=\u00a012; 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0y) and elderly (n\u00a0=\u00a012; 70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0y) men prior to and immediately after a five day period of one-legged knee immobilization by way of a full leg cast. At baseline, elderly men had a greater IMTG content when compared with the young (56.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1 and 34.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00b7g\u2212\u00a01, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with no changes in either group following immobilization (53.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0 and 35.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00b7g\u2212\u00a01, respectively; P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In line, five days of disuse did not lower citrate synthase, \u03b2-HAD or cytochrome C oxidase activity in skeletal muscle tissue. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity increased following immobilization in the older subjects only, from 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 to 0.55 0.05\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00b7g\u2212\u00a01\u00b7min\u2212\u00a01 (71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The skeletal muscle mRNA expression of PGC1\u03b1 and citrate synthase both declined following immobilization in both the young and elderly subjects. We conclude that five days of muscle disuse does not increase intramuscular lipid deposition or reduce the maximal activity of key mitochondrial enzymes within the skeletal muscle of young or older men.",

However, the co-stimulatory molecules that exert a direct effect on MDSCs-mediated age-dependent tumor susceptibility and the regulatory mechanism of their expression remain unclear. In the present study, we found that accumulation of MDSCs in aged mice was closely correlated with age-dependent enhanced growth of lung cancer. Further analysis revealed that B7-H1 was highly expressed in the MDSCs of 18-month but not in 2-month old mice. Accordingly, inhibition of B7-H1 with B7-H1 specific antibody significantly reactivated T cells and reduced the tumor progression mediated by MDSCs. In addition, IL-10 released from 18-month old mice stimulated the expression of B7-H1 on MDSCs. These results suggest that B7-H1 expressed on MDSCs is a novel target for reducing lung cancer susceptibility as the age increases.",

The change in perceived fatigue was measured after a fast-pace 400\u00a0meter walk test. Adults that rated feeling more tired after walking (n\u00a0=\u00a010) had higher SFA stiffness (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but not carotid artery stiffness, than adults that reported feeling more energetic after walking (n\u00a0=\u00a022). The change in perceived fatigue rating was normalized to energy expenditure during walking to determine perceived fatigability. Adults were divided into lower and higher perceived fatigability groups (n\u00a0=\u00a022 per group). Carotid artery stiffness was not different between perceived fatigability groups after adjusting for age, sex, body fat, systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, daily physical activity levels, and resting diameter. However, SFA stiffness was significantly elevated in the higher as compared to lower perceived fatigability group (\u03b2-index: 20.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 vs. 15.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0U; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) after adjusting for the abovementioned variables. Moreover, stepwise regression identified SFA \u03b2-index to be an independent predictor of perceived fatigability (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.38, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). These results suggest that peripheral arterial stiffness is independently associated with perceived fatigue and fatigability in older adults.",

The present study aimed to examine the association of the hippocampal volume with mean values and coefficients of variation (CoV) of spatio-temporal gait parameters among cognitively healthy individuals (CHI) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).A total of 90 individuals (47 CHI with a mean age of 69.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0years and 48.9% women, and 43 MCI individuals with a mean age of 70.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0years and 62.8% women) were included in this cross-sectional study. The hippocampal volume was quantified from a three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI using semi-automated software.

     "abstract": "Honey bee workers display remarkable flexibility in the aging process. This plasticity is closely tied to behavioral maturation. Workers who initiate foraging behavior at earlier ages have shorter lifespans, and much of the variation in total lifespan can be explained by differences in pre-foraging lifespan. Vitellogenin (Vg), a yolk precursor protein, influences worker lifespan both as a regulator of behavioral maturation and through anti-oxidant and immune functions. Experimental reduction of Vg mRNA, and thus Vg protein levels, in wild-type bees results in precocious foraging behavior, decreased lifespan, and increased susceptibility to oxidative damage. We sought to separate the effects of Vg on lifespan due to behavioral maturation from those due to immune and antioxidant function using two selected strains of honey bees that differ in their phenotypic responsiveness to Vg gene knockdown. Surprisingly, we found that lifespans lengthen in the strain described as behaviorally and hormonally insensitive to Vg reduction. We then performed targeted gene expression analyses on genes hypothesized to mediate aging and lifespan: the insulin-like peptides (Ilp1 and 2) and manganese superoxide dismutase (mnSOD). The two honey bee Ilps are the most upstream components in the insulin-signaling pathway, which influences lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster and other organisms, while manganese superoxide dismutase encodes an enzyme with antioxidant functions in animals. We found expression differences in the llps in fat body related to behavior (llp1 and 2) and genetic background (Ilp2), but did not find strain by treatment effects. Expression of mnSOD was also affected by behavior and genetic background. Additionally, we observed a differential response to Vg knockdown in fat body expression of mnSOD, suggesting that antioxidant pathways may partially explain the strain-specific lifespan responses to Vg knockdown.",

These metabolic pathways are integrated by a key cytoplasmic organelle, the mitochondria, leading to production of many metabolic intermediates and harvest cellular energy in the form of ATP. Sirtuins are a highly conserved family of proteins that mediate cellular physiology and energy demands in response to metabolic inputs. Mitochondria inhabit three main types of sirtuins classified as Sirt3, Sirt4 and Sirt5. These sirtuins regulate mitochondrial metabolic functions mainly through controlling post-translational modifications of mitochondrial protein. However, the biological mechanism involved in controlling mitochondrial metabolic functions is not well understood at this stage. In this review the current knowledge on how mitochondrial sirtuins govern mitochondrial functions including energy production, metabolism, biogenesis and their involvement in different metabolic pathways are discussed. The identifications of potential pharmacological targets of sirtuins in the mitochondria and the bioactive compounds that target mitochondrial sirtuins will increase our understanding on regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in normal and disease state.",

The results showed that GA pretreatment significantly alleviated the macroscopic and histopathological damages in mice skin caused by UV. Meanwhile, the data also indicated that GA markedly up-regulated the activities of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH-Px), and increased the content of skin collagen, while obviously decreased malonaldehyde level and inhibited high expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and -3 (MMP-3), as well as down-regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10.

     "abstract": "In the primary visual cortex (V1), monocular deprivation (MD) induces a shift in the ocular dominance (OD) of binocular neurons towards the open eye (Wiesel and Hubel, 1963; Gordon and Stryker, 1996). In V1 of C57Bl/6J mice, this OD-plasticity is maximal in juveniles, declines in adults and is absent beyond postnatal day (PD) 110 (Lehmann and L\u00f6wel, 2008) if mice are raised in standard cages. Since it was recently shown that brief dark exposure (DE) restored OD-plasticity in young adult rats (PD70-100) (He et al., 2006), we wondered whether DE would restore OD-plasticity also in adult and old mice and after a cortical stroke. To this end, we raised mice in standard cages until adulthood and transferred them to a darkroom for 10\u201314\u00a0days. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging we demonstrate that short-term DE can restore OD-plasticity after MD in both adult (PD138) and old mice (PD535), and that OD-shifts were mediated by an increase of open eye responses in V1. Interestingly, restored OD-plasticity after DE was accompanied by a reduction of both parvalbumin expressing cells and perineuronal nets and was prevented by increasing intracortical inhibition with diazepam. DE also maintained OD-plasticity in adult mice (PD150) after a stroke in the primary somatosensory cortex. In contrast, short-term DE did not affect basic visual parameters as measured by optomotry. In conclusion, short-term DE was able to restore OD-plasticity in both adult and aging mice and even preserved plasticity after a cortical stroke, most likely mediated by reducing intracortical inhibition.",

     "abstract": "The widely-known Gompertz law of mortality states the exponential increase of mortality with age in human populations. Such an exponential increase is observed at the adulthood span, roughly after the reproductive period, while mortality data at young and extremely old ages deviate from it. The heterogeneity of human populations, i.e. the existence of subpopulations with different mortality dynamics, is a useful consideration that can explain age-dependent mortality patterns across the whole life-course. A simple mathematical model combining the heterogeneity of populations with an assumption that the mortality in each subpopulation grows exponentially with age has been proven to be capable of reproducing the entire mortality pattern in a human population including the observed peculiarities at early- and late-life intervals. In this work we fit this model to actual (Swedish) mortality data for consecutive periods and consequently describe the evolution of mortality dynamics in terms of the evolution of the model parameters over time. We have found that the evolution of the model parameters validates the applicability of the compensation law of mortality to each subpopulation separately. Furthermore, our study has indicated that the population structure changes so that the population tends to become more homogeneous over time. Finally, our analysis of the decrease of the overall mortality in a population over time has shown that this decrease is mainly due to a change in the population structure and to a lesser extent to a reduction of mortality in each of the subpopulations, the latter being represented by an alteration of the parameters that outline the exponential dynamics.",

Senescence was induced in HepG2 cells using sub-lethal concentrations of H2O2. Gene expression of control and senescent HepG2 cells were studied. Comparison was made with patients with cirrhosis and three public microarray datasets. H2O2-treated HepG2 cells demonstrated characteristic cellular senescence. There was differential expression of 354 genes in senescence. Up-regulated genes in HepG2 senescence were also up regulated in patients with cirrhosis. The senescent hepatocyte gene signature distinguished liver disease from normal by unsupervised clustering in the public chronic liver disease microarray datasets, with enrichment of the senescence gene signature in all three datasets. The senescent hepatocyte gene signature included changes in cell cycle regulation, morphology, inflammation, signal transduction, metabolism and stellate cell activation, which alongside impaired synthetic function in senescence in vitro were consistent with manifestations of clinical liver disease, suggesting a close relation between hepatocyte senescence and manifestations of chronic liver disease including fibrosis and impaired synthetic function.",

     "abstract": "There has been growing interest in the relation between anxiety disorders and physical conditions in the general adult population. However, little is known about the nature of this association in older adults. Understanding the complex relationship between these disorders can help to inform prevention and treatment strategies unique to this rapidly growing segment of the population.A total of 10,409 U.S. adults aged 55\u00a0+ participated in Wave 1 (2001\u20132002) and Wave 2 (2004\u20132005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Lifetime and past-year DSM-IV anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders, and lifetime personality disorders, were assessed in both waves. Participants self-reported on whether they had been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with a broad range of physical health conditions; this study focuses on cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease, and arthritis. Multivariable logistic regressions adjusted for sociodemographics, comorbid mental disorders, and number of physical health conditions assessed: (1) the relation between past-year physical conditions at Wave 1 and incident past-year anxiety disorders at Wave 2 and; (2) the relation between individual lifetime anxiety disorders at Wave 1 and incident physical conditions at Wave 2. A second set of adjusted multinomial logistic regressions examined Wave 1 sociodemographic and physical and mental health risk factors associated with incident physical condition alone, anxiety disorder alone, and comorbid anxiety and physical condition at Wave 2.Past-year arthritis at Wave 1 was significantly associated with increased odds of incident generalized anxiety disorder at Wave 2. Further, any lifetime anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder at Wave 1 were significantly associated with increased odds of incident gastrointestinal disease at Wave 2. Differential sociodemographic and physical and mental health predictors were significantly associated with increased odds of incident comorbid anxiety disorder and physical conditions.Results of the current study elucidate the longitudinal bidirectional relationships between anxiety disorders and physical health conditions in a large, nationally representative sample of older adults. These results have important implications for identifying at risk older adults, which will not only impact this growing segment of the population directly, but will also potentially lessen burden on the healthcare system as a whole.",

Although dietary habits have long been associated with aging, eating habits and behaviors have rarely been included in various proposed indices of successful aging. The aim of this work was to evaluate determinants of successful aging together with assessment of dietary habits in relation to healthcare facility use among elders living in the Mediterranean basin. During 2005\u20132011, 2663 elderly (aged 65\u2013100\u00a0years) individuals from 21 Mediterranean islands and rural Mani region (Peloponnesus) were voluntarily enrolled in the study. A successful aging index ranging from a score of 0 to a score of 10 was constructed using 10 attributes, i.e., education, financial status, physical activity, body mass index, depression, participation in social activities with friends and family, number of yearly excursions, number of cardiovascular disease risk factors and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The applied factor analysis on the components of the index extracted three main components for successful aging: psychosocial-economic, bioclinical and lifestyle; confirming the multiple dimensions of aging. After adjusting for confounders, a 1/10-unit increase in the successful aging index was associated with 0.8 less annual visits to healthcare centers (95% CI \u2212\u00a01.3 to\u00a0\u22120.2). Stratified analysis by gender revealed heterogeneity of factors predicting successful aging. These findings suggest that successful aging is a multidimensional and complex concept that exhibits gender heterogeneity. Annual use of health care services by the elders was found to be related to level of successful aging.",

Studies have shown sarcopenic obese adults to be at higher risk for declines in physical function. Despite this rising public health concern, no intervention studies currently exist in this population.A total of 21 sarcopenic obese adults, 60\u00a0years or older, were randomized into two groups, strength/hypertrophy (SH, n\u00a0=\u00a09) and high-speed circuit (HSC, n\u00a0=\u00a08) and were trained for 15\u00a0weeks.

     "abstract": "The decline in the plasma level of melatonin has been associated with increased oxidative stress in the physiological system while aging. The increased levels of oxidants are known to augment the nitro-oxidative stress, which induces the apoptotic factors in lymphoid organs leading to age dependent immunosenescence. There are no reports to date that can suggest how the age dependent nitro-oxidative stress can influence the melatonin membrane MT1/MT2R expression and immune status of any small ruminant. In the present study, we noted the expression of melatonin receptors MT1R and MT2R and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) along with the apoptotic markers (viz. Bcl-2, Bax and Pro-caspase-3) in the spleen of young, middle-aged and old-aged Indian goat Capra hircus. The lymphocyte proliferation was also recorded along with the total nitrite and nitrate ion concentration (NOx) in the spleen and plasma. An age dependent decline in MT1R and MT2R expressions and lymphocyte proliferation with increased level of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and iNOS expression was noted. An increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and a decreased Pro-caspase-3 expression were observed in the spleen of goat with an age dependent decline in the peripheral melatonin level. This decline in melatonin along with reduced melatonin receptor (MT1/MT2) expression and elevated RNS level in the spleen with aging might have an important role in the regulation of immune function of goats. Our observations suggest that the age-associated immunosenescence observed in goats can be a consequence of declining melatonin and its receptor expression and induction of apoptotic factors influenced by the increased RNS level that deteriorates the proper functioning of the spleen.",

Plasma PAI-1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in samples collected from 76 patients with MCI, 74 patients with AD, and 76 healthy controls. Our results show that plasma PAI-1 levels gradually increased as dementia progressed. The mean levels of plasma PAI-1 in patients with MCI and AD patients were significantly higher than those of in healthy controls. Consistently, neuropsychological examination (e.g., MMSE, CDR) also demonstrated significant correlations between the plasma PAI-1 levels and cognitive function.

Anandamide is synthesized on demand and its endogenous level is regulated through its degradation, where fatty acid amide hydrolase plays a major role. The aim of this study was to characterize anandamide breakdown in physiological and pathological aging and its regulation by CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists.Fatty acid amide hydrolase activity was analyzed in an independent cohort of human cortical membrane samples from control and Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients, and in membrane and synaptosomes from adult and aged rat cerebral cortex. Our results demonstrate that fatty acid amide hydrolase activity decreases in the frontal cortex from human patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and this effect is mimicked by A\u03b21-40 peptide. This activity increases and decreases in aged rat cerebrocortical membranes and synaptosomes, respectively. Also, while the presence of JWH-133, a CB2 selective agonist, slightly increases anandamide hydrolysis in human controls, it decreases this activity in adults and aged rat cerebrocortical membranes and synaptosomes. In the presence of WIN55,212-2, a mixed CB1/CB2 agonist, anandamide hydrolysis increases in Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients but decreases in human controls as well as in adult and aged rat cerebrocortical membranes and synaptosomes. Although a similar profile is observed in fatty acid amide hydrolase activity between aged rat synaptic endings and human Alzheimer\u2019s disease brains, it is differently modulated by CB1/CB2 agonists. This modulation leads to a reduced availability of anandamide in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and to an increased availability of this endocannabinoid in aging.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether vestibular control of standing balance is altered with adult aging. Eight old (~\u00a077\u00a0years) and eight young (~\u00a026\u00a0years) men stood without aids on a commercially available force plate with their head turned to the right, arms relaxed at their sides and eyes closed while receiving stochastic vestibular stimuli (0\u201325\u00a0Hz, root mean square amplitude\u00a0=\u00a00.85\u00a0mA). Surface electromyography signals were sampled from the left soleus, medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. Whole-body balance, as measured by the anteroposterior forces and muscle responses, was quantified using frequency (coherence and gain functions) and time (cumulant density function) domain correlations with the vestibular stimuli. Old men exhibited a compressed frequency response of the vestibular reflex with a greater relative gain at lower frequencies for the plantar flexors and anteroposterior forces than young. In the time domain, the peak amplitude of the short latency response was 45\u201364% lower for the plantar flexors and anteroposterior forces (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) in the old than young, but not for the tibialis anterior (p\u00a0=\u00a00.21). The old men had a 190% and 31% larger medium latency response for only the tibialis anterior and anteroposterior forces, respectively, than young (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). A strong correlation between the tibialis anterior and the force response was also detected (r\u00a0=\u00a00.80, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In conclusion, net vestibular-evoked muscle responses led to smaller short and larger medium latency peak amplitudes in anteroposterior forces for the old. The present results likely resulted from a compressed and lower operational frequency range of the vestibular reflexes and the activation of additional muscles (tibialis anterior) to maintain standing balance.",

For this purpose, a rat model for IDDM was established by streptozotocin application. The rats were randomly divided into four groups of 8 animals each: CON 6 (control group sacrificed after 6\u00a0months of the experiment), CON 12 (control group sacrificed after 12\u00a0months of the experiment), DM 6 (streptozotocin treated and sacrificed after 6\u00a0months of diabetes) and DM 12 (streptozotocin treated and sacrificed after 12\u00a0months of diabetes). The periods of 6 and 12\u00a0months were taken to observe the changes in lipid metabolism for chronic, long-term diabetes. Fatty acid profiles of the liver and skeletal muscle total lipids and phospholipids as well as desaturation indices for \u22066 desaturase (D6D), \u22065 desaturase (\u22066D), \u22069 desaturase (\u22069D) and de novo lipogenesis index (DNL) were estimated. Additionally the long-term effects (12\u00a0months) were tested in the brain, perirenal fat and bone marrow. The fatty acid composition of lipids was altered in IDDM rats in all tested tissues. The desaturation indices revealed the expected significant decrease in \u22069D and \u22065D indices in tested tissues, while indices for \u22066D were not influenced by diabetes. DNL revealed the strong inhibition of de novo lipogenesis in the liver tissue. Values for arachidonic C20:4n6 (arachidonic acid) significantly decreased in liver total lipids in DM 6 and DM 12 groups and in phospholipids in the DM 12 group. Surprisingly, values for C20:4n6 were also significantly lower in the brain tissue in the DM 12 group. Accumulation of C20:4n6 precursors (C18:2n6 and C20:3n6) was visible in all tissues. Docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n3) significantly decreased in liver total lipids, liver phospholipids and in the brain phospholipids of the DM 12 group. The present results show that age could exacerbate the expected decrease in the liver synthesis of C20:4n6 in IDDM. Moreover, long-term diabetes could impair C22:6n3 synthesis in the liver and muscle, and incorporation of both important fatty acids into brain phospholipids. In conclusion, numerous changes in fatty acid composition are caused by long-term diabetes in aged rats. These changes could be involved in the pathogenesis of senile and diabetes-induced damage. The results could have clinical significance due to the increasing age of diabetic patients.",

     "abstract": "C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) are recruited by a variety of transcription factors to mediate gene repression. Nematode CTBP-1 has previously been shown to play a role in the regulation of lifespan; Caenorhabditis elegans strains carrying a deletion in the ctbp-1 gene showed a 10\u201320% increase in mean and maximal lifespan compared with wild-type control strains. We set out to identify the tissues in which CTBP-1 functions to regulate lifespan in C. elegans. Our analysis of reporter genes shows that CTBP-1 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system with lower levels detectable in the hypodermis. Tissue-specific rescue experiments demonstrated that CTBP-1 functions in the nervous system to regulate lifespan. Previously, the lifespan extension in a ctbp-1 mutant was attributed, at least in part, to the misregulation of a lipase gene, lips-7. We therefore focussed on lips-7 and found that expressing CTBP-1 solely in the nervous system of a ctbp-1 mutant significantly reduced lips-7 transcription. In addition, we studied another ctbp-1 mutant allele that also displayed a long-lived phenotype. In this case, lips-7 expression was unaffected. This observation argues that, while lips-7 may play a role in lifespan, its de-repression is not essential for the extension of lifespan phenotype. We show that a prominent site of LIPS-7 expression is the hypodermis, one of the sites of fat storage in C. elegans. Interestingly, we did not observe co-localisation of CTBP-1 and lips-7 transcription in the nervous system, indicating that CTBP-1 may be acting indirectly, in a cell non-autonomous manner. In summary, our data confirm that CTBP-1 is involved in the regulation of lips-7 transcription but suggest that it may perform additional roles in the nervous system that contribute to the regulation of longevity.",

A proposed explanation of the evolution of species-specific senescence patterns is that increased levels of energy allocation to intra-male competition decrease the amount of energy available for somatic maintenance, leading to earlier or faster actuarial senescence. Previous studies did not provide support for such relationships, but did not focus on the intensity of allocation likely to shape inter-specific variation in actuarial senescence in males. Here, by analyzing data from 56 species of captive large herbivores, we tested whether actuarial senescence is more pronounced in species displaying a well-defined \u2018rut\u2019 period than in species with year-round reproduction. Using an original quantitative metric of the annual duration of reproductive activity, we demonstrated that the length of the mating season has no detectable effect on actuarial senescence. On the other hand, both diet and body mass are important factors shaping actuarial senescence patterns in male captive herbivores.",

The aim of this study is to analyze the role of endothelin-1 in the cardiac and coronary changes induced by age and whether these changes may be attenuated by a three-month caloric restriction.Hearts from young (3\u00a0months old), aged (24\u00a0months old) and aged rats after 3\u00a0months of caloric restriction were perfused according to the Langendorff technique. Coronary vasoconstriction to endothelin-1 was reduced in old rats, and endothelin-1 increased myocardial contractility (dP/dt) and heart rate in old but not in young rats. These changes observed in old rats were partly reversed by caloric restriction. Also, in the myocardial tissue of old rats the gene expression of endothelin-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) was increased, and the gene expression of endothelin ETB receptors and endothelial nitric oxide syntase (eNOS) was reduced, compared with young rats. Aging induced changes in the expression of ETB receptors and eNOS were reversed by caloric restriction.These results suggest that aging produces alterations in myocardial and coronary responses to endothelin-1, that may be related to changes in expression of nitric oxide synthases and/or endothelin receptor subtypes, with some of these changes being prevented by caloric restriction.",

Percentages of both naive Treg (nTreg; CD45RA+CD25intFOXP3low) and memory Treg (memTreg; CD45RA-CD25highFOXP3high) cells were determined by flow cytometry in peripheral blood samples of healthy individuals of various ages (20\u201384\u00a0years). Circulating Th1, Th2 and Th17 effector cells were identified by intracellular staining for IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-17, respectively, upon in vitro stimulation with PMA and calcium ionophore. Whereas proportions of nTreg cells declined with age, memTreg cells increased. Both Th1 and Th2 cells were largely maintained in the circulation of aged humans, whereas Th17 cells were decreased. Similar to memTreg cells, the 3 Teff subsets resided primarily in the memory CD4+ T cell compartment. Overall, Treg/Teff ratios were increased in the memory CD4+ T cell compartment of aged individuals when compared to that of young individuals. Finally, the relative increase of memTreg cells in elderly individuals was associated with poor responses to influenza vaccination.

All the subjects lived in Sardinia, an Italian island, that has the higher prevalence of centenarians than in other European countries. A comparison among the three classes of age showed a significant depletion of Ca, Co, Fe, Mn and Se (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in nonagenarians and centenarians with respect to controls. In particular, the geometric mean (GM) values of Ca, Co, Fe, Mn and Se were: 94.1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 0.46\u00a0ng/ml, 1314\u00a0ng/ml, 2.47\u00a0ng/ml and 111\u00a0ng/ml in controls; 87.6\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 0.22\u00a0ng/ml, 815\u00a0ng/ml, 1.07\u00a0ng/ml and 88.9\u00a0ng/ml in nonagenarians; 87.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 0.29\u00a0ng/ml, 713\u00a0ng/ml, 1.27\u00a0ng/ml and 81.9\u00a0ng/ml in centenarians.

Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of concurrent endurance and power-like strength training exercise sequence on muscular and functional adaptations of older participants. Thirty-six healthy older men not engaged in systematic exercise training programs for at least 6\u00a0months were divided into a control group (CON; 65.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0years), or in the training groups: endurance\u2013strength (ES; 63.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00a0years), or strength\u2013endurance (SE; 67.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0years). Training groups underwent 12\u00a0weeks of concurrent endurance and power-like strength training, starting every exercise session with either endurance (in ES) or strength (in SE) exercises. Measurements included knee extension one repetition maximum (1RM), knee extension power, 30\u00a0second sit-to-stand test (30SS), maximum vastus lateralis surface electromyographic activity, and rectus femoris echo intensity (RFEI). Significant increases in maximal strength (ES +\u00a018\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.3%; SE +\u00a014.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05), peak power (ES +\u00a022.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.4%; SE +\u00a026.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031.3%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05), and 30SS performance (ES +\u00a015.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2%; SE +\u00a013.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.8%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) were observed only in the training groups, with no differences between ES and SE.

These results demonstrate that concurrent strength and endurance training performed twice a week effectively increases muscular performance and functional capacity in older men, independent of the intra-session exercise sequence. Additionally, the RFEI decreases indicate an additional adaptation to concurrent training.",

Numerous health benefits have been attributed to its consumption, including the recent suggestion that it may decrease blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. Insulin signaling is an integral pathway regulating the lifespan of laboratory organisms, such as worms, flies, and mice. We posited that if cinnamon truly improved the clinical signs of diabetes in people that it would also act on insulin signaling in laboratory organisms and increase lifespan. We found that cinnamon did extend lifespan in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. However, it had no effect on the expression levels of the 3 aging-related Drosophila insulin-like peptides nor did it alter sugar, fat, or soluble protein levels, as would be predicted. In addition, cinnamon exhibited no protective effects in males against oxidative challenges. However, in females it did confer a protective effect against paraquat, but sensitized them to iron. Cinnamon provided no protective effect against desiccation and starvation in females, but sensitized males to both. Interestingly, cinnamon protected both sexes against cold, sensitized both to heat, and elevated HSP70 expression levels. We also found that cinnamon required the insulin receptor substrate to extend lifespan in males, but not females. We conclude that cinnamon does not extend lifespan by improving stress tolerance in general, though it does act, at least in part, through insulin signaling.",

This assay allows for the separation of individual nematodes based on their speed. We show that this phenotype could be used as a biomarker for aging because it is a better predictor of lifespan than chronological age. Fast nematodes have longer lifespans, fewer protein carbonyls, higher heat-shock resistance, and higher transcript levels of the daf-16 and hsf-1 genes, which code for the stress response transcription factors, than slow nematodes. High transcript levels of the genes coding for heat-shock proteins observed in slow nematodes correlate with lower heat-shock resistance, more protein carbonyls, and shorter lifespan. Taken together, our data suggests that shorter lifespan results from early-life damage accumulation that causes subsequent faster age-related deterioration.",

Royalactin plays a central role in this process by switching on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling pathway which ultimately leads to epigenetic changes and a long-lived queen phenotype. Recently it was shown that royalactin by itself also extends lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster. Yet, the mechanism by which royalactin promotes longevity remains largely unknown.We set out to characterize the effects of royalactin on Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan, and clarify the possible involvement of EGF signaling in this process. We demonstrate that royalactin extends lifespan of this nematode and that both EGF (LIN-3) and its receptor (LET-23) are essential to this process. To our knowledge, this is the first report of royalactin-mediated lifespan extension in a non-insect species. Additionally, we show that royalactin enhances locomotion in adult nematodes, implying that royalactin also influences healthspan.Our results suggest that royalactin is an important lifespan-extending factor in royal jelly and acts by promoting EGF signaling in C. elegans. Further work will now be needed to clarify which (secondary) signaling pathways are activated by royalactin, and how this ultimately translates into an extended health- and lifespan.",

While some studies have found that greater serum uric acid is associated with better cognition in older adults, it is also associated with numerous vascular risk factors that increase risk for dementia. Women may also be particularly vulnerable to the vascular effects of elevated uric acid. We previously found that mildly elevated serum uric acid is a biomarker of cognitive dysfunction in older adults, and that this likely is mediated by cerebral ischemic burden. Here we examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between serum uric acid and declines in cognition and functioning in 423 cognitively healthy community-dwelling older women in the Women's Health and Aging Study (WHAS II). We hypothesized that higher serum uric acid would be associated with poorer concurrent functioning and greater declines over 9\u00a0years. In linear regression analyses, higher baseline serum uric acid was associated with poorer working memory, with a trend toward slower manual speed and dexterity before and after adjusting for baseline serum uric acid, demographic and health/cardiovascular variables. However, there were no associations for global cognitive functioning, learning/memory, sequencing, verbal fluency, or visuoconstruction. Mixed effects models also revealed no association with subsequent cognitive declines.

     "abstract": "Melatonin, the main product synthesized by the pineal gland, modulates several brain functions through different mechanisms, some of them involving the activation or participation of calcium binding intracellular proteins, such as the alpha calcium dependent protein kinase C and calmodulin. Another calcium-binding protein is calretinin, which exerts an essential role for adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Melatonin favors calretinin-positive neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of young mice but hippocampal neurogenesis and plasma levels of melatonin decrease during aging. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the impact of exogenous supplementation with melatonin in calretinin-neurons and their distribution along the dorsal\u2013ventral DG in the hippocampus at three different time points (1, 3, or 6\u00a0months) after daily treatment with melatonin (8\u00a0mg/kg) in male Balb/C mice. We found an increase in the number of calretinin-positive neurons in the DG after treatment (>\u00a066%). Although a significant decline in the number of calretinin-neurons was found in both treated (~\u00a060.46\u201369.56%) and untreated mice (~\u00a068.81\u201370.34%) with respect to the youngest mice analyzed, melatonin still maintained higher number of cells in the DG. Also, the distribution of calretinin-neurons along the dorsal\u2013ventral DG significantly showed more cells in the ventral-DG of mice treated with melatonin. Together, the data suggest that melatonin also acts on calretinin in the DG, supporting it as a molecule connecting calcium signaling and neuronal development.",

     "abstract": "Increasing cellular damage during the aging process is considered to be one factor limiting the lifespan of organisms. Besides the DNA and lipids, proteins are frequent targets of non-enzymatic modifications by reactive substances including oxidants and glycating agents. Non-enzymatic protein modifications may alter the protein structure often leading to impaired functionality. Although proteolytic systems ensure the removal of modified proteins, the activity of these proteases was shown to decline during the aging process. The additional age-related increase of reactive compounds as a result of impaired antioxidant systems leads to the accumulation of damaged proteins and the formation of protein aggregates. Both, non-enzymatic modified proteins and protein aggregates impair cellular functions and tissue properties by a variety of mechanisms. This is increasingly important in aging and age-related diseases. In this review, we will give an overview on oxidation and glycation of proteins and the function of modified proteins in aggregate formation. Furthermore, their effects as well as their role in aging and age-related diseases will be highlighted.",

     "abstract": "Advanced glycation end product (AGE) accumulations as well as a high fat diet are associated with cardiovascular diseases. AGEs are recognized by several receptor molecules of which the receptor of AGEs (RAGE) is currently the most intensively studied. Activation of RAGE causes an unfavorable pro-inflammatory state. The hypothesis of this study was that metabolic stress due to a high fat diet results in the development of aortic valve stenosis and that knockout of RAGE should be protective.Six week old male C57BL/6N and C57BL/6N RAGE\u2212/\u2212 \u00a0mice (n\u00a0=\u00a028) were randomly assigned to 4 groups and fed with normal or high fat diet for 32\u00a0weeks. Weight gain was determined weekly. At the start of the experiment and after 2, 4 and 7\u00a0months, echocardiographic assessments of the aortic valve were made. At the end of the experiment, plasma lipid levels and histological changes of the valves were determined.The high fat diet resulted in accelerated weight gain. However, after 7\u00a0month, only C57BL/6 mice developed increased trans-aortic-valve velocities, leaflet thickness and reduced valve area index (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Immunohistochemistry of the aortic valves revealed in C57BL/6N mice on a high fat diet more calcification, AGE accumulation and RAGE expression when compared to normal fed control. Hearts and aortic valves of RAGE\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice showed less morphometric changes, calcification and AGE accumulation. After 7\u00a0months of high fat feeding C57BL/6 mice (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) as well as RAGE\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) had significantly increased cholesterol levels compared to normal fed control, however RAGE\u2212/\u2212 \u00a0mice were probably protected due to a better HDL/LDL ratio when compared to wild type animals (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).These data suggest that AGEs and RAGE are involved in the development of obesity, hypercholesterolemia and aortic valve changes due to metabolic stress from high fat intake.",

All vital organs begin to lose some function during aging with different rates, and the same happens on the lung. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs, which progresses very slowly and the majority of patients are therefore elderly. COPD is a major and increasing global health problem with enormous amount of expenditure of indirect/direct health care costs, and therefore, there is urgent need to clarify the molecular mechanism of COPD and develop novel treatments. We here hypothesize that environmental gases, such as cigarette smoke and kitchen pollutants, may accelerate the aging of lung or worsen aging-related events in the lung, leading to defective resolution of inflammation, reduced anti-oxidant capacity and defective disposal of abnormal proteins, and this consequently induces progression of COPD. Recent studies identified some anti-aging small molecules (geroprotectors) that may open up new avenues for the treatment of COPD.",

To investigate the biological age of the old rats in this rat strain (F344 BN hybrid), a second set of experiments comparing muscle fiber size and specific force (maximum force normalized to CSA) was investigated in fast- and slow-twitch distal hind limb muscles in 3 different age groups: young adults (6\u00a0months), middle aged (18\u00a0months) and old rats (28\u00a0months).This study shows an unexpected response of the diaphragm fibers to 5\u00a0days CMV, demonstrating an increased CSA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in both young and old animals. Furthermore, an observed decreased maximum force of 39.8\u201345.2% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in both young and old animals compared with controls resulted in a dramatic loss of specific force. We suggest that this increase in CSA and decrease in specific force observed in both the young and old diaphragm fibers is an ineffective compensatory hypertrophy in response to the CMV. These results demonstrate an important mechanism of significant importance for the weaning problems associated with mechanical ventilation.",

Previous research mostly suggests a robust causal impact of FA on PA. However, some research, drawing from Fredrickson's broaden-and-build theory, also points to the possibility of an inverse causality between FA and PA. We examine in this paper both of these causal directions in SI as well as UI individuals across a 4\u00a0year observation period. Additionally, we checked for the role of negative affect (NA). The T1\u2013T2 sample comprised 81 out of 237 SI individuals (visually or hearing impaired) assessed at T1, with a mean age at T1 of 81.8\u00a0years, and 87 UI individuals out of 150 assessed at T1, with a mean age at T1 of 81.5\u00a0years. Established scales were used to assess FA, PA, and NA. Using cross-lagged panel analysis to examine the direction of causality, our findings indicate that FA has significant impact on PA in both the SI and the UI group, whereas the alternative causal pathway was not confirmed. Both cross-lagged relationships between FA and NA were non-significant. No group differences in path strengths between SI and UI were present. Our study provides evidence that FA is a key competence for successful emotional aging in vulnerable groups of very old adults such as SI as well as in UI adults in advanced old age.",

We utilized measures of stressful life events (SLE) and hassles from 1989 to 2004, and men were followed for mortality until 2010. For life events and hassles, previous research identified three and four patterns of change over time, respectively, generally indicating low, moderate, and high trajectories, with one moderate, non-linear pattern for hassles (shallow U curve). Controlling for demographics and health behaviors, we found that those with moderate SLE trajectories (38%) more likely to die than those with low SLE trajectories, HR\u00a0=\u00a01.42, 95% CI [1.16, 3.45].

This essay critically assesses the understanding of this concept common among biogerontologists, and proposes a new definition. A current conception of anti-aging treatment imagines a primary cause of aging that is causally upstream of, and the cause of, all age-related pathology. Intervening in this aging process thus protects against the totality of age-related diseases. However, this underlying aging process remains an abstraction. By contrast, what is demonstrable is that interventions in model organisms can improve late-life health and extend lifespan. Furthermore, a safe deduction is that treatments that extend lifespan do so by reducing age-related pathology, both florid and subtle. What is currently identifiable about aging (i.e. senescence) is that it is a very complex disease syndrome, likely involving a number of biological mechanisms. Treatments that substantially extend lifespan must suppress multiple pathologies that otherwise limit lifespan, but whether they suppress the entire aging process remains undemonstrated. A more pragmatic and realistic definition of anti-aging treatment is any preventative approach to reduce late-life pathology, based on the understanding that senescence is a disease syndrome. This definition would encompass preventative approaches aimed at both broad and narrow spectra of age-related pathologies. Its adoption would facilitate translation, since it would shift the emphasis to medical practice, particularly the introduction of preventative approaches. Narrow spectrum anti-aging treatments (e.g. the cardiovascular polypill) could establish a practice that eventually extends to broader spectrum anti-aging treatments (e.g. dietary restriction mimetics).",

     "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer disease (AD); however, how DM favors evolution of AD is still insufficiently understood. Hyperglycemia in DM is associated to an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, as well as damage of hippocampal cells, reflected by changes in morphological and mitochondrial functionality. Similar mitochondrial damage has been observed when amyloid beta (A\u03b2) accumulates in the brain of AD patients. In DM, the excess of glucose in the brain induces higher activity of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), it synthesizes UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is used by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) to catalyze O-GlcNAcylation of numerous proteins. Although O-GlcNAcylation plays an important role in maintaining structure and cellular functionality, chronic activity of this pathway has been associated with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia-induced glucose toxicity. Three different forms of OGT are known: nucleocytoplasmic (ncOGT), short (sOGT), and mitochondrial (mOGT). Previous reports showed that overexpression of ncOGT is not toxic to the cell; in contrast, overexpression of mOGT is associated with cellular apoptosis. In this work, we suggest that hyperglycemia in the diabetic patient could induce greater expression and activity of mOGT, modifying the structure and functionality of mitochondria in hippocampal cells, accelerating neuronal damage, and favoring the start of AD. In consequence, mOGT activity could be a key point for AD development in patients with DM.",

     "abstract": "Age-related muscle weakness is only partially related to muscle atrophy, due to neuromuscular changes including reduced voluntary muscle activation and antagonist muscle co-activation. The respective contribution of these mechanisms in exercise-induced strength gains at higher age is unclear. Here the literature was systematically reviewed for studies reporting exercise-induced effects on voluntary muscle activation and antagonist muscle co-activation in elderly persons. Seventeen relevant studies were identified, 4 investigated voluntary muscle activation, 8 antagonist muscle co-activation and 5 studies investigated both. Meta-analysis showed an exercise-induced improvement in voluntary activation in plantar flexors (weighted mean difference (WMD) +\u00a08.8%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and knee extensors (WMD +\u00a01.8%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with greater gains in activation capacity obtained in subjects with lower voluntary activation level prior to the onset of training. We found no significant overall effect of strength training on antagonist co-activation during ankle plantar flexion (WMD +\u00a00.6%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.686) or knee extension (WMD \u2212\u00a01.1%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.699 for the RCT's and \u2212\u00a01.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.516 for the non-controlled trials). Based on our results we can conclude that there is evidence for exercise-induced increase in voluntary activation related to strength gains in the lower extremities in elderly persons. The results for exercise-induced effects on antagonist co-activation are inconsistent and more research is necessary to determine its contribution to strength gains following resistance training in elderly persons.",

However, the exact molecular mechanisms that govern protein metabolism that may lead to toxicity remain largely unclear. Originally targeted as the causative agent, it has since become evident that aggregation formation may not be necessary for disease progression and studies show that they may even serve functional and protective roles. Although the focus has since shifted to the toxicity of intermediate protein species preceding aggregation formation, many questions remain: Is the blame for the neural destruction to be put on one event alone, or rather on a state of cellular disequilibrium resulting from multiple events? If the cause is multifactorial, then what triggers the toxic cascade and how can this be targeted therapeutically? In order to understand the origin of toxicity, the exact underlying mechanism and impact of each contributing process must be assessed. Therefore, the structural properties, mechanism of formation, cytotoxic and/or protective effects, as well as the clinical impact of protein intermediates and aggregates will be reviewed here with the goal to establish a neurodegenerative disease model aimed at improving current therapeutics, which may ultimately contribute towards improved treatment modalities.",

     "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is an important cause of disability in activities of daily living (ADL) through its effect on physical functioning. However, it is unclear whether subclinical vascular abnormalities and rate of change in subclinical vascular abnormalities is also associated with an impaired physical ability and with ADL disability. In a longitudinal study, 490 middle-aged and older persons were included. Physical ability was measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery and ADL disability using a questionnaire on self-reported basic and instrumental ADL. Subclinical vascular abnormalities were measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT, in men only). Longitudinal associations between baseline markers of subclinical vascular abnormalities, their rate of change, and change in physical ability or ADL disability were assessed using generalized estimation equation models. After adjustment for confounders, higher baseline PWV, change in PWV, baseline CIMT (in men) and change in CIMT (in men) were associated with a higher rate of change in physical ability (regression coefficients 0.035, 95% CI [0.018; 0.052]; 0.047, 95% CI [0.024; 0.069]; 0.214, 95% CI [0.070; 0.358] and 0.148, 95% CI [0.019; 0.277], respectively). No relations were found for change in ADL disability. In subjects with incident cardiovascular disease, higher change in PWV was associated with a higher rate of change in ADL disability (regression coefficient 0.054, 95% CI [0.001; 0.106]). The present study showed that subclinical vascular abnormalities and rate of change were associated with higher rate of change in physical ability. The association between (change in) subclinical vascular abnormalities and ADL disability tended to be stronger in persons with incident and prevalent cardiovascular disease. These data may suggest that ADL decline is more a direct effect of experienced clinically manifest vascular events rather than the effect of progression of subclinical vascular abnormalities.",

Measurements were made using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Pb, Cd) and a single purpose spectrometer AMA 254 (Hg).Geometric means (GM) of whole blood lead (B-Pb), cadmium (B-Cd) and mercury (B-Hg) levels were 25.3\u00a0\u03bcg/l, 0.55\u00a0\u03bcg/l and 0.21\u00a0\u03bcg/l, respectively. No age-related differences were found for B-Pb and B-Cd levels but a negative correlation with age was observed for B-Hg levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). B-Pb levels in men were significantly higher than in women (GM 29.9\u00a0\u03bcg/l vs. 24.1\u00a0\u03bcg/l). B-Cd was significantly higher in women (GM 0.57\u00a0\u03bcg/l) than in men (0.50\u00a0\u03bcg/l) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and in smokers (GM 1.29\u00a0\u03bcg/l) than in nonsmokers (GM 0.53\u00a0\u03bcg/l) (p\u00a0=\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and in seniors from Prague (GM 0.60\u00a0\u03bcg/l) compared to those from Teplice (GM 0.43\u00a0\u03bcg/l) (p\u00a0=\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Seniors with a history of chronic kidney disease, stroke and those using psycho-pharmaceuticals had higher B-Pb levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008, 0.04 and 0.05, resp.), seniors diagnosed with atherosclerosis had higher B-Cd levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and seniors using psycho-pharmaceuticals had higher B-Hg levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). B-Hg levels were also positively correlated with blood albumin levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015).This study provides data on levels of heavy metals in a group of elderly people.

     "abstract": "Here, we chronologically analyzed age-associated changes of cAMP- and MAPK-signaling in Leydig cells (LCs) in relation with decreased testosterone (T) production. In Wistar rats, decreased serum T observed in 12 to 24-month-old rats was not related to decreased serum LH concentration but to reduced luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhr/LHR) and time-coordinated reduction of steroidogenic gene expression (decreased Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1 in 12-month-old rats followed by decreased Star/StAR, Hsd3b/HSD3B, Hsd17b4, and increased Cyp19a1 later in life). The predecessors of age-related changes noted in LCs from 6 to 12-month-old rats were increased level of soluble adenylate cyclase (Adcy/AC) 10, increased JNK phosphorylation but suppressed P38 MAPK. At approximately the same time changed mRNA abundance for transcription factors important for steroidogenesis was detected (increased Nur77 and decreased Sf1, Dax1). Aging caused biphasic expression pattern of ERK1/2 and Nur77: increased in 12-month but decreased in LCs from 24-month-old rats. Further, decreased basal cAMP level observed from 12 to 24th month coincidence with increased expression of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (Pde)4a, Pde4b and regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (Prkar/PKAR). Exposing of senescent LCs to permeable cAMP-analog improved transcription of Sf1, Nur77, Star, Cyp11a1,Cyp17a1, but without effect on aging pattern of Dax1, Pde4a/b, Prkar2a, Lhr and MAPK genes. Collectively, results indicated that age-related LC dysfunction is accompanied with changes in MAPK and cAMP signaling and coordinated reduction in the expression of many of the genes that participate in T synthesis. The predecessors of aged-related changes are increased ratio of pJNK/JNK, AC10 and decreased P38 level in LCs from 6-month-old rats.",

We tested the hypothesis that exercise training of the quadriceps muscle with low rate ECC and high rate ECC contractions in the form of stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs) but at equal total mechanical work would produce rate-specific adaptations in healthy old males age 60\u201370. Both training programs produced similar improvements in maximal voluntary isometric (6%) and ECC torque (23%) and stretch-shortening cycle function (reduced contraction duration [24%] and enhanced elastic energy storage [12%]) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The rate of torque development increased 30% only after SSC exercise (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Although the rate of muscle tension during the SSC vs. ECC contractions was about 4-fold greater, the total mechanical work seems to regulate the hypetrophic, hormonal, and most of the mechanical adaptations. However, SSC exercise was uniquely effective in improving a key deficiency of aging muscle, i.e., its ability to produce force rapidly.",

A rat model of dexamethasone (DEX) induced muscle atrophy and a human 56-day bed rest study with and without vibration therapy were used to assess biological and clinical relevance.A technically robust ELISA measuring the Titin fragment was developed against a Titin peptide fragment identified in human urine. The fragment was shown to be produced primarily by MMP-2 cleavage of Titin. In the rat muscle DEX induced atrophy model, Titin-MMP2 fragment was decreased in the beginning of DEX treatment, and then significantly increased later on during DEX administration. In the human bed rest study, the Titin-MMP2 fragment was initially decreased 11.9 (\u00b1\u00a03.7) % after 1\u00a0day of bed rest, and then gradually increased ending up at a 16.4 (\u00b1\u00a04.6) % increase at day 47.We developed a robust ELISA measuring a muscle derived MMP-2 generated Titin degradation fragment in rat and human serum. Importantly, the fragment can be measured in serum and that these levels are related to induction of skeletal muscle atrophy.",

The aim of this project is to compare the prevalence of age-related diseases and telomere length (TL), a marker of biological age and mortality, across five groups of subjects: semisupercentenarians (SSCENT) (105\u2013109\u00a0years old), centenarians (CENT) (100\u2013104\u00a0years old), centenarians' offspring (CO), age- and gender-matched offspring of parents who both died at an age in line with life expectancy (CT) and age- and gender-matched offspring of both non-long-lived parents (NLO). Information was collected on lifestyle, past and current diseases, medical history and medication use. SSCENT displayed a lower prevalence of acute myocardial infarction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027), angina (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) and depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021) relative to CENT. CO appeared to be healthier compared to CT who, in turn, displayed a lower prevalence of both arrhythmia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) and hypertension (p\u00a0=\u00a00.046) than NLO, characterized by the lowest parental longevity. Interestingly, CO and SSCENT exhibited the longest (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the shortest (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) telomeres respectively while CENT showed no difference in TL compared to the younger CT and NLO. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that the longevity of parents may influence the health status of their offspring. Moreover, our data also suggest that both CENT and their offspring may be characterized by a better TL maintenance which, in turn, may contribute to their longevity and healthy aging. The observation that SSCENT showed considerable shorter telomeres compared to CENT may suggest a progressive impairment of TL maintenance mechanisms over the transition from centenarian to semisupercentenarian age.",

Until recently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the DR-mediated lifespan extension were completely unknown but extensive efforts led to the identification of several key players in this process. Culture in sterile axenic medium is a method of DR (ADR), leading to an impressive doubling of lifespan. Earlier, we established that ADR-mediated longevity is independent of Ins/IGF signaling and eat-2. The only gene reported to be indispensable for the ADR lifespan effect is cbp-1 (Zhang et al., 2009) which was confirmed in this study. In an attempt to identify more genes involved in ADR-mediated longevity, we tested several candidate genes known to regulate lifespan extension in other DR regimens. We found that cup-4 is equally important as cbp-1 in ADR-mediated longevity and we identified some genes that may contribute to ADR-induced longevity, but are not required for the full lifespan effect.",

     "abstract": "Menopause leads to a decrease in estrogen production that increases central insulin resistance, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We have evaluated the influence of aging and estradiol or genistein treatments on some key stages of the insulin signaling pathway in the cerebral cortex. Young and aged female Wistar rats were ovariectomized and treated acutely with 17\u03b2-estradiol (1.4\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight), two doses of genistein (10 or 40\u00a0mg/kg body weight), or vehicle. The cortical expression of several key insulin signaling pathway components was analyzed by western blotting. Our results showed an age-related deterioration in the interactions between the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85\u03b1) and the activated form of insulin receptor substrate 1 (p-IRS1tyr612), as well as between p85\u03b1 and the 46\u00a0kDa isoform of the estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b146). Moreover, aging also decreased the translocation of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane. 17\u03b2-Estradiol but not genistein reduced the negative impact of aging on central insulin sensitivity by favoring this GLUT4 translocation, and therefore could be neuroprotective against the associated neurodegenerative diseases. However, protein kinase B (Akt) activation by genistein suggests that other possible mechanisms are involved in the neuroprotective effects of this phytoestrogen during the aging process.",

     "abstract": "Ageing is associated with an overall decline in the functional capacity of tissues and stem cells, including haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), as well as telomere dysfunction. Dietary restriction (DR) is a recognised anti-ageing intervention that extends lifespan and improves health in several organisms. To investigate the role of telomeres and telomerase in haematopoietic ageing, we compared the HSPC profile and clonogenic capacity of bone marrow cells from wild type with telomerase-deficient mice and the effect of DR on these parameters.Compared with young mice, aged wild type mice demonstrated a significant accumulation of HSPCs (1.3% vs 0.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and elevated numbers of granulocyte/macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM, 26.4 vs 17.3, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0037) consistent with myeloid \u201cskewing\u201d of haematopoiesis. DR was able to restrict the increase in HSPC number as well as the myeloid \u201cskewing\u201d in aged wild type mice. In order to analyse the influence of short telomeres on the ageing phenotype we examined mice lacking the RNA template for telomerase, TERC\u2212/\u2212. Telomere shortening resulted in a similar bone marrow phenotype to that seen in aged mice, with significantly increased HSPC numbers and an increased formation of all myeloid colony types but at a younger age than wild type mice. However, an additional increase in erythroid colonies (BFU-E) was also evident. Mice lacking telomerase reverse transcriptase without shortened telomeres, TERT\u2212/\u2212, also presented with augmented haematopoietic ageing which was ameliorated by DR, demonstrating that the effect of DR was not dependent on the presence of telomerase in HSPCs. We conclude that whilst shortened telomeres mimic some aspects of haematopoietic ageing, both shortened telomeres and the lack of telomerase produce specific phenotypes, some of which can be prevented by dietary restriction.",

The disruption of cell homeostasis, such as Ca2\u00a0+ signaling and mitochondrial respiration, contributes to the loss of viability and ultimately leads to cell death. However, the link between Ca2\u00a0+ signaling and p53 signaling remains unclear. During aging, there are alterations in cell physiology that are commonly associated with a reduced adaptive stress response, thus increasing cell vulnerability. In this work, we examined the effects of a cytoplasmic p53 inhibitor (pifithrin \u03bc) in the striatum of young and aged rats by evaluating Ca2\u00a0+ signaling, mitochondrial respiration, apoptotic protein expression, and tissue viability. Our results showed that pifithrin \u03bc differentially modulated cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2\u00a0+ in young and aged rats. Cytoplasmic p53 inhibition appeared to reduce the mitochondrial respiration rate in both groups. In addition, p53 phosphorylation and Bax protein levels were elevated upon cytoplasmic p53 inhibition and could contribute to the reduction of tissue viability. Following glutamate challenge, pifithrin \u03bc improved cell viability in aged tissue, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). Taken together, these results indicate that cytoplasmic p53 may have a special role in cell viability by influencing cellular Ca2\u00a0+ homeostasis and respiration and may produce differential effects in the striatum of young and aged rats.",

EPCs could have a potential for future therapies with the purpose of enhancing endothelial repair. However, due to the low amount of these cells in circulation they have to be expanded in vitro before administration into recipients. The purpose of this study was to analyse and evaluate possible changes in morphology and functionality as a result of in vitro ageing of a subtype of EPCs called endothelial outgrowth cells (EOCs), since such changes might compromise the cells' ability to participate in vasculogenesis.EOCs were isolated and grown from human umbilical cord blood using two methodologies with varying degree of cell purification. The changes between the two culture setups and the changes occurring in EOCs over time were traced by flow cytometry and assays for growth, tube formation, and beta-galactosidase production.The cells showed to be indistinguishable from each other during the first weeks of culture. The cells showed a changed morphology with bigger and more granular cells and the growth rate decreased with time. The cells also showed an increased Beta-galactosidase expression and decreased tube formation ability in late passage EOCs.Our data indicates that EOCs undergo senescence during long-term expansion and therefore time for cell harvest has to be validated in order to achieve functional cells still maintaining a therapeutic potential. A possible application in large animal or humans could be local injection of EOCs into affected areas and thereby reducing the need for long-term expansion of the cells.",

In this study, we identify and characterize miRNAs during cellular senescence in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Using previously reported miRNAs, expression profiling of 23 miRNAs was performed using real-time PCR analysis. Among these miRNAs, 19 miRNAs showed upregulated expression patterns in senescent MSCs compared with young MSCs, and 5 miRNAs were downregulated. These miRNAs have not been previously identified as being related to cellular senescence but seem to be related. miR-103-2*, miR-140-5p and miR-330-5p are highly upregulated, while miR-29b and miR-199b-5p are significantly downregulated in senescent MSCs. We identify unique functions of 5 miRNAs and predict putative target genes of 5 miRNAs using our previous report. Among them, miR-199b-5p directly suppressed LAMC1 expression, as shown in a luciferase assay. miR-199b-5p significantly regulates translational activity but does not control post-transcriptional activity. Likewise, miR-199b-5p modulates LAMC networks, which demonstrates the resulting phenomenon during cellular senescence, namely, that miR-199b-5p indirectly regulates cellular senescence in MSCs.",

Aged rats were less susceptible to EAE induction, and the neurological and histological picture was milder in those rats which developed the clinically manifested disease. At the peak of the disease, several times fewer mononuclear cells and T lymphocytes were isolated from the spinal cords of aged rats compared with the young ones. The frequency of CD4+ cells among TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ lymphocytes, as well as that of reactivated CD134(OX40)+ cells within its CD4+ T-lymphocyte subpopulation, was less in spinal cords of aged compared with young rats. Additionally, CD134 surface density on CD4+ lymphocytes was decreased in the spinal cord of aged rats. The changes in CD134 expression most likely reflected in part age-related intrinsic changes in CD4+ lymphocytes as the expression of this molecule was also impaired on in vitro stimulated na\u00efve CD4+ splenocytes from aged rats compared with young animals. In addition, greater frequency of CD8+ lymphocytes with regulatory phenotypes could also contribute to impaired CD4+ cell reactivation in aged rats. The increased apoptosis of CD4+ cells from aged rats was consistent with their impaired reactivation and it was accompanied by the greater frequency of CD4+CD11b+CD45int/high cells, which are supposed to be actively engaged in apoptotic cell phagocytosis and to have immunoregulatory properties. Compared with young rats, following short-term PMA and ionomycin stimulation in vitro, the frequency of IL-17+ and IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ T lymphocytes among the spinal cord mononuclear cells from aged rats and the cytokine expression density on a per lymphocyte basis were reduced. Additionally, the increase in the proportion of autoregulatory IL-17+IL-10+ cells on the account of proinflammatory IL-17+IFN-\u03b3+ cells within IL-17+ lymphocytes suggested their lower pathogenic capacity in aged rats. This most likely reflected alterations in the aged rat spinal cord cytokine milieu, which were mirrored in a diminished expression of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA followed by an enhanced expression of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA. Overall, the study points to age-related changes in T lymphocytes and other cells from the spinal cord infiltrate which could contribute to the decreased susceptibility of aged rats to the induction of EAE.",

     "abstract": "Disruption of the growth hormone (GH) axis promotes longevity and delays aging. In contrast, GH over-expression may lead to accelerated aging and shorter life. Calorie restriction (CR) improves insulin sensitivity and may extend lifespan. Long-lived Ames dwarf (df/df) mice have additional extension of longevity when subjected to 30% CR. The aim of the study was to assess effects of CR or GH replacement therapy separately and as a combined (CR\u00a0+\u00a0GH) treatment in GH-deficient df/df and normal mice, on selected metabolic parameters (e.g., insulin, glucose, cholesterol), insulin signaling components (e.g., insulin receptor [IR] \u03b2-subunit, phosphorylated form of IR [IR pY1158], protein kinase C \u03b6/\u03bb [p-PKC\u03b6/\u03bb] and mTOR [p-mTOR]), transcription factor p-CREB, and components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (p-ERK1/2, p-p38), responsible for cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. CR decreased plasma levels of insulin, glucose, cholesterol and leptin, and increased hepatic IR \u03b2-subunit and IR pY1158 levels as well as IR, IRS-1 and GLUT-2 gene expression compared to ad libitum feeding, showing a significant beneficial diet intervention effect. Moreover, hepatic protein levels of p-PKC\u03b6/\u03bb, p-mTOR and p-p38 decreased, and p-CREB increased in CR mice. On the contrary, GH increased levels of glucose, cholesterol and leptin in plasma, and p-mTOR or p-p38 in livers, and decreased plasma adiponectin and hepatic IR \u03b2-subunit compared to saline treatment. There were no GH effects on adiponectin in N mice. Moreover, GH replacement therapy did not affect IR, IRS-1 and GLUT-2 gene expression. GH treatment abolishes the beneficial effects of CR; it may suggest an important role of GH\u2013IGF1 axis in mediating the CR action. Suppressed somatotrophic signaling seems to predominate over GH replacement therapy in the context of the examined parameters and signaling pathways.",

This study compares the influence of some upper arm measurements and of Body Mass Index (BMI) on survival of the 77 subjects aged 98\u00a0years and over (98\u00a0+) recruited within the MALVA project, one of the first Italian population-based studies on extremely old people. Adopting methods for multiple imputation of missing values, Gompertz regression models adjusted for gender and age were estimated for each anthropometric character or combination of characters, i.e. BMI; mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)\u00a0+\u00a0elbow breadth (EB)\u00a0+\u00a0triceps skinfold thickness (TSF); corrected arm muscle area (CAMA). Being underweight and having a low CAMA and a low MUAC/high EB were positively associated with an increased risk of death, while no significant association was found with the condition of being overweight/obese and the triceps skinfold thickness. When anthropometric variables were included in regression models along with covariates relating to nutritional and functional status, BMI and MUAC, but not CAMA, emerged as protective factors.It is suggested that MUAC can be recommended in evaluating the health status of extremely old people and that measuring EB may help to estimate the non-boney component of the arm.",

     "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) represents one of the most common chronic health problems that faces an aging population. In the peripheral auditory system, aging is accompanied by functional loss or degeneration of sensory as well as non-sensory tissue. It has been recently described that besides the degeneration of cochlear structures, the central auditory system is also involved in ARHL. Although mechanisms of central presbycusis are not well understood, previous animal studies have reported some signs of central neurodegeneration in the lower auditory pathway. Moreover, changes in neurophysiology are indicated by alterations in synaptic transmission. In particular, neurotransmission and spontaneous neuronal activity appear to be affected in aging animals. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to determine the neuronal activity within the central auditory pathway in aging mice over their whole lifespan compared to a control group (young adult animals, ~\u00a03\u00a0months of age) using the non-invasive manganese-enhanced MRI technique. MRI signal strength showed a comparable pattern in most investigated auditory brain areas.An increase in activity was particularly pronounced in the middle-aged groups (13 or 18\u00a0months), with the largest effect in the dorsal and ventral cochlear nucleus. In higher auditory structures, namely the inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body and auditory cortex, the enhancement was much less expressed; while a decrease was detected in the superior olivary complex. Interestingly, calcium-dependent activity reduced to control levels in the oldest animals (22\u00a0months) in the cochlear nucleus and was significantly reduced in higher auditory structures. A similar finding was also found in the hippocampus. The observed changes might be related to central neuroplasticity (including hyperactivity) as well as neurodegenerative mechanisms and represent central nervous correlates of the age-related decline in auditory processing and perception.",

     "abstract": "Corn oil has been recommended as a replacement for saturated fats because of its high levels of poly- and mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In the present study, we tested whether very high levels of corn oil (58.6% fat-derived calories, FDC) intake improve health and longevity of aging mice. Twelve month old male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet (10% FDC of corn oil, N) or a high fat diet (58.6% FDC of corn oil, HF) for 13\u201315\u00a0months. Our results show that a HF diet significantly increased the longevity of the aged mice (at 25\u00a0months of age, 53.8% of mice died in the N group, whereas the mortality rate was only 23.2% in the HF group). High corn oil also reversed aging-increased blood lipids including triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL. Similarly, high corn oil intake overturned aging-raised pro-inflammatory markers including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the blood. In addition, corn oil intake reversed aging-damaged rotarod performance and liver function. Interestingly, the HF group was significantly heavier than the N group (53.6\u00a0g/mouse vs. 41.3\u00a0g/mouse); however, both HF and N groups had the same calorie intake (12.48\u00a0kcal/d/mouse vs. 12.24\u00a0kcal/d/mouse). Although, the HF group's food consumption was lower than that of the N group (2.4\u00a0g/d/mouse vs. 3.4\u00a0g/d/mouse). These results suggest that if total calorie consumption stays in the normal range, very high levels of corn oil intake improve health and longevity of aging mice.",

In this cross-sectional analysis of baseline data of 3537 community-dwelling adults aged 50 to 75\u00a0years of a large German cohort study, we assessed the hypothesis that shorter telomere length might be a biological marker for frailty. Using whole blood DNA we examined mean telomere repeat copy to single gene copy number (T/S ratio) using quantitative PCR. Construction of a frailty index (FI) was based on a deficit accumulation approach, which quantifies frailty as ratio of the deficits present divided by the total number of deficits considered. Mean FI was determined according to age by tertiles of T/S ratio. Furthermore, we used correlation analyses stratified for gender and age groups to examine the association of the T/S ratio with frailty. Mean FI value was similar across tertiles of the T/S ratio (0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14, 0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 and 0.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14, respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09)), and FI and the T/S ratio were uncorrelated in gender- and age-specific analyses. In conclusion, T/S ratio and frailty were unrelated in this large sample of older adults. T/S ratio may therefore not be a meaningful biological marker for frailty.",

     "abstract": "Normal aging is characteristic with the gradual decline in cognitive function associated with the progressive reduction of structural and functional plasticity in the hippocampus. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has developed into a novel neurological and psychiatric tool that can be used to investigate the neurobiology of cognitive function. Recent studies have demonstrated that low-frequency rTMS (\u2264\u00a01\u00a0Hz) affects synaptic plasticity in rats with vascular dementia (VaD), and it ameliorates the spatial cognitive ability in mice with A\u03b21\u201342-mediated memory deficits, but there are little concerns about the effects of rTMS on normal aging related cognition and synaptic plasticity changes. Thus, the current study investigated the effects of rTMS on spatial memory behavior, neuron and synapse morphology in the hippocampus, and synaptic protein markers and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) in normal aging mice, to illustrate the mechanisms of rTMS in regulating cognitive capacity. Relative to adult animals, aging caused hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment, simultaneously inhibited the activation of the BDNF\u2013TrkB signaling pathway, reduced the transcription and expression of synaptic protein markers: synaptophysin (SYN), growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) and post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), as well as decreased synapse density and PSD (post-synaptic density) thickness. Interestingly, rTMS with low intensity (110% average resting motor threshold intensity, 1\u00a0Hz, LIMS) triggered the activation of BDNF and TrkB, upregulated the level of synaptic protein markers, and increased synapse density and thickened PSD, and further reversed the spatial cognition dysfunction in aging mice. Conversely, high-intensity magnetic stimulation (150% average resting motor threshold intensity, 1\u00a0Hz, HIMS) appeared to be detrimental, inducing thinning of PSDs, disordered synaptic structure, and a large number of lipofuscin accumulations, as well as reducing the number of synapses and downregulating BDNF\u2013TrkB and synaptic proteins. Ultimately, HIMS further impaired the capacity for learning and memory. In conclusion, we infer that aging-induced cognitive deficits are closely associated with hippocampal structural synaptic plasticity, and low-frequency magnetic stimulation plays an important role in regulating cognitive behavior via changing structural synaptic plasticity, and BDNF signaling might participate in this event.",

This study investigates the effect of two weeks of immobilization followed by six weeks of supervised cycle training on muscle oxidative capacity in 17 young (23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years) and 15 elderly (68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years) healthy men. We applied high-resolution respirometry in permeabilized fibers from muscle biopsies at inclusion after immobilization and training. Furthermore, protein content of mitochondrial complexes I\u2013V, mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mtHSP70) and voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) were measured in skeletal muscle by Western blotting. The elderly men had lower content of complexes I\u2013V and mtHSP70 but similar respiratory capacity and content of VDAC compared to the young. In both groups the respiratory capacity and protein content of VDAC, mtHSP70 and complexes I, II, IV and V decreased with immobilization and increased with retraining. Moreover, there was no overall difference in the response between the groups. When the intrinsic mitochondrial capacity was evaluated by normalizing respiration to citrate synthase activity, the respiratory differences with immobilization and training disappeared. In conclusion, aging is not associated with a decrease in muscle respiratory capacity in spite of lower complexes I\u2013V and mtHSP70 protein content. Furthermore, immobilization decreased and aerobic training increased the respiratory capacity and protein contents of complexes I\u2013V, mtHSP70 and VDAC similarly in the two groups. This suggests that inactivity and training alter mitochondrial biogenesis equally in young and elderly men.",

The environmental enrichment (EE) was carried out 3\u00a0h/day over a period of two months and then, the rats were tested in the elevated zero-maze (EZM) and radial-arm water maze (RAWM). Behavioral results showed that, even at an advanced age, EE was able to reduce anxiety-related behaviors and improve the performance in the RAWM. Regarding the neurobiological data, Synapsin I expression in the dorsal CA3, but not in the ventral, was enhanced both in enriched and standard rats when they performed the behavioral testing. Interestingly, the EE exposure was enough to increase Synapsin I in the ventral CA3. The analysis of GR in the dorsal hippocampus showed an increase of this receptor in the dDG both in enriched and standard rats when they performed the behavioral testing, whereas in the dCA1 and dCA3, the effect of the testing depended on the previous housing condition. In the ventral region, we found that the effects of EE were higher because on the one hand, the GR expression induced by the behavioral testing was enhanced in the dSUB, vCA1 and vCA3 when the rats were previously enriched and on the other hand, EE, regardless of the behavioral testing, increased the GR expression in the vDG and vSUB. Therefore, our results suggest that the effect of the behavioral testing on the neurobiological mechanisms studied is different depending on the previous housing condition of aged rats.",

Cognitive and psycho-functional status was evaluated using mini-mental state examination (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL) scale, and geriatric depression scale (GDS). Mini-nutritional assessment (MNA) was applied. Anthropometric measurements were taken and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Body composition was assessed by means of specific bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA), using the references for the elderly. In comparison with the reference group, patients with AD showed similar BMI and MNA, but peculiar bioelectrical characteristics: lower phase angles and longer vectors (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). According to specific BIVA, this bioelectrical pattern is indicative of a reduction of lean tissue mass and an increase of percent fat mass (FM%). A more accentuated lean mass reduction (p < 0.05) was observed in women with worse cognitive status and a FM% increase (p < 0.01) in women with worse functional status.In conclusion, patients with AD had lower lean tissue mass and higher percent fat mass than healthy elderly individuals. In women, this pattern was associated with cognitive and functional decline, as indicated by MMSE and ADL values. Specific BIVA showed to be a suitable technique in the elderly, that could enhance BMI and MNA information in the evaluation of nutritional status.",

Instead, perhaps handgrip strength should only be used to describe upper body strength or functionality, which may compliment isokinetic assessments of lower body strength, which were reliable and related to balance.",

     "abstract": "Stiffening of large elastic arteries with age increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We investigated the role of mitochondrial quality control (QC, i.e., mitophagy and biogenesis) in arterial stiffening with aging. In C57BL6 mice, aging was associated with impaired aortic expression of mitochondrial QC mediators, greater activation of the mitochondrial redox/stress sensor p66shc, elevated superoxide production and increased arterial stiffness\u2014as indicated by ~\u00a025% higher aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV). In old mice, supplementation with trehalose, a nutraceutical reported to enhance mitophagy, normalized mitochondrial QC markers, p66shc activation and superoxide production, and reduced aPWV and aortic collagen I (a structural protein that confers stiffness). In vitro experiments suggested that mitochondrial QC processes were enhanced in the aortas from old trehalose-treated mice, and in aortic rings studied ex vivo, both aging and treatment with the mitochondrial stressor rotenone were associated with increases in p66shc activation and intrinsic mechanical stiffness, whereas co-incubation with trehalose prevented these effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that mitochondrial stress/dysfunction as a result of impaired mitochondrial QC contributes to large elastic artery stiffening with age. Enhancing mitochondrial QC with agents such as trehalose may be a novel strategy for reducing age-associated arterial stiffness and CVD.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of aging on maximal and rapid velocity characteristics of the leg extensor muscles. Twenty-three young (age\u00a0=\u00a025\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0yrs) and twenty-one old (72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0yrs) men performed three leg extension maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) at 240\u00b0\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01 and at maximum unloaded velocity (Vmax). Vmax was calculated as the highest velocity attained during the unloaded MVC and RVD was the linear slope of the velocity\u2013time curve for the 240\u00a0deg\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01 (RVD240) and maximum unloaded velocity (RVD\u2013Vmax) contractions. The old men exhibited lower (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) Vmax (10.1%), RVD240 (37.2%), and RVD\u2013Vmax (26.7%) compared to the young men. These lower velocity characteristics for the old men may contribute to the increased functional limitations often observed in older adults. Interestingly, the greater age-related declines observed for RVD240 and RVD\u2013Vmax compared to Vmax perhaps suggest an enhanced age-related impairment in the ability of the older adults' muscle to generate velocity rapidly versus the ability to generate maximal velocity. Such findings highlight the importance of time-dependent velocity measures when assessing the effects of aging on rapid velocity capacities.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia is an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function that is multifactorial in etiology. Age-related changes in the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS), increased oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation likely all contribute to its development. Losartan, an angiotensin II type I receptor blocker (ARB) decreases RAS activity and likely influences oxidative stress and inflammation. Given this, we hypothesized that losartan would improve activity levels and parameters related to inflammation and oxidative stress in older mice. We sought to test this hypothesis by comparing functional and molecular parameters between 18-month-old C57BL/6 mice treated with 50\u201370\u00a0mg/kg/day of losartan over a 4\u00a0month-period and age- and gender-matched mice receiving placebo. Losartan treatment significantly improved several activity measurements during treatment period compared to placebo controlled group, including increased time on treadmill, traveling activity, standing activity, and decreased grid contacts (p-values\u00a0<\u00a00.05, 0.001, 0.01; and 0.04 respectively). Grip strength did not improve in treatment group relative to control group over time. Serum IL-6 level in the treated group was significantly lower than that in the control group at the end of treatment (30.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.9 vs. 173.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a059.5\u00a0pg/ml, p\u00a0<\u00a00.04), and mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes catalase (3.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 vs. 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4) and glutathione peroxidase (4.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 vs. 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4) was significantly higher (p-value: 0.02, and 0.03 respectively) in quadriceps muscle after 4\u00a0months of treatment in treated and control groups. These results support the hypothesis that chronic losartan treatment improves skeletal muscle related activity measures in older mice, and that it is associated with more favorable relevant biological profiles in the treatment group. Additional studies are needed to 1) further quantify this functional improvement, 2) further identify mechanisms that influence this improvement, and 3) provide additional rationale for translating these findings into older adults.",

     "abstract": "A pharmaceutical intervention that has received great attention in recent years for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the use of antibodies targeting amyloid beta (A\u03b2) in the brain, as the formation of A\u03b2 plaques is considered as being the driving force for the development and progression of AD. Recently, a Phase III trial in patients with mild-to-moderate AD has provided ambivalent evidence for the efficacy of this intervention. In this trial, the intravenous administration of bapineuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting A\u03b2 in the brain, for 78\u00a0weeks led to a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid levels of phosphorylated tau and evidence for lower A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain of AD patients who carried APOE \u03b54. However, this treatment did not improve clinical outcomes (e.g. the rate of cognitive decline) in these patients. Similar null results with respect to the rate of cognitive decline were found in a separate Phase III clinical trial after treatment with solanezumab. Based on these findings, one conclusion could be that antibodies targeting A\u03b2 in the brain may unfold their highest efficacy when given before the development of clinical AD symptoms, i.e. during a period where neurodegeneration but not cognitive loss represents the major pathology. Another conclusion could be that antibody-based pharmaceutical interventions may fail to slow the progress of cognitive loss in patients who have AD because of their solely pharmaceutical therapeutic approach. Leisure activities that require patients' mental and physical abilities (e.g. exercise) are associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia. In the same manner, they may help to curb the progress of this devastating disease. Thus, combining the use of antibodies targeting A\u03b2 with therapeutic strategies that require patients' mental and physical abilities might help tackle the neurodegenerative dynamics and cognitive loss both in patients with AD, and its prodromal state, mild cognitive impairment.",

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that calf muscle-specific vasodilator responses are associated with walking performance fatigue in healthy older adults. Forty-five older (60\u201378\u00a0yrs) adults performed a fast-paced 400\u00a0m walk test. Twelve of these adults exhibited fatigue as defined by slowing of walking speed (\u2265\u00a00.02\u00a0m/s) measured during the first and last 100\u00a0m segments of the 400\u00a0m test. Peak calf vascular conductance was measured following 10\u00a0min of arterial occlusion using strain-gauge plethysmography. Superficial femoral artery (SFA) vascular conductance response to graded plantar-flexion exercise was measured using Doppler ultrasound. No difference was found for peak calf vascular conductance between adults that slowed walking speed and those that maintained walking speed (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05); however, older adults that slowed walking speed had a lower SFA vascular conductance response to calf exercise (at highest workload: slowed group, 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 vs. maintained group, 3.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0ml/kg/min/mm\u00a0Hg; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Moreover, the initial increase in SFA vascular conductance from rest to exercise was positively correlated with the change in walking speed for all adults (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.41, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). In conclusion, these results suggest that calf exercise hemodynamics are associated with walking performance fatigability in older adults.",

Data in both humans and mice suggest a role for PAPP-A in aging and age-related diseases. However, our knowledge of tissue-specific PAPP-A expression and possible changes in this expression with age is limited. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PAPP-A mRNA expression in multiple tissues with age in both male and female mice using real-time PCR. These included the heart, liver, kidney, bone, fat, skeletal muscle, gonads, brain, thymus and spleen. In young mice, PAPP-A mRNA was expressed at relatively high levels in all tissues examined except for liver. The only difference in expression between males and females was seen in the kidney, subcutaneous fat and gonads. The highest PAPP-A mRNA expression levels were found in visceral fat and these were 10-fold higher than in subcutaneous fat. PAPP-A expression significantly increased with age in kidney, brain and gonads. PAPP-A expression significantly deceased with age in bone and skeletal muscle. In the thymus, PAPP-A mRNA showed a biphasic response with age. There were no age-related changes in PAPP-A expression seen in any of the other tissues examined. Expression of IGFBP-5 mRNA, a marker of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) bioactivity known to be regulated by PAPP-A, paralleled the changes in PAPP-A expression with age in kidney, bone, skeletal muscle and thymus. Thus, tissue-specific PAPP-A expression in mice is differentially affected during aging, and may regulate local IGF-I bioactivity in certain tissues.",

All RTD values were normalized (nRTD) to peak torque, while RER values were normalized (nRER) to peak-to-peak M-wave amplitude (MPP). Absolute voluntary RTDs and RERs were 58\u2013122% and 70\u201376% greater (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) for the young men, respectively.

Normalizing RTD to peak torque and RER to M-wave amplitude eliminated the age-related differences and suggested that the age-related declines in RTD and RER were a result of reduced muscle strength and M-wave amplitude, respectively. Therefore, our findings questioned the value of RTD and RER measurements in the various time intervals for explaining sarcopenia and suggested that maximal strength and M-wave amplitude may be sufficient.",

This is accompanied by elevated phosphorylation of p38. Here, we further investigate whether aging affects activation of p38 signaling and the inflammatory reaction after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the lungs of mice in vivo and humans ex vivo. The data showed that activation of p38 peaked at 0.5\u00a0h and then rapidly declined in young (2-month-old) mouse lung, after intranasal inhalation challenge with LPS. In contract, activation of p38 peaked at 24\u00a0h and was sustained longer in aged (20-month-old) mice. As well as altered p38, activations of its upstream activator MKK and downstream substrate NF-\u03baB were also changed in the lungs of aged mice, which corresponded with the absence in the early phase but delayed increases in concentrations of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Consistent with the above observations in mice, similar patterns of p38 signaling also occurred in human lungs. Compared with younger lungs from adult\u2013middle aged subjects, the activation of p38, MKK and NF-\u03baB, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in the lungs of older subjects ex vivo. Exposure of human lung cells to LPS induced rapid activation of p38, MKK and NF-\u03baB in these cells from adult\u2013middle aged subjects, but not older subjects, with increases in the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. The LPS-induced rapid activation in the lung cells from adult\u2013middle aged subjects occurred as early as 0.25\u00a0h after exposure, and then declined. Compared with adult\u2013middle aged subjects, the LPS exposure did not induce marked changes in the early phase, either in the activation of p38, MKK and NF-\u03baB, or in the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or IL-6 in the lung cells from older subjects. In contrast, these changes occurred relatively late, peaked at 16\u00a0h and were sustained longer in the lungs of older subjects. These data support the hypothesis that the sustained activation of the p38 signaling pathway at baseline and the absence in the early phase but delayed of p38 signaling pathway response to LPS in the elderly may play important roles in increased susceptibility of aged lungs to inflammatory injury.",

     "abstract": "Gene variants found to associate with human longevity in one population rarely replicate in other populations. The lack of consistent findings may partly be explained by genetic heterogeneity among long-lived individuals due to cohort differences in survival probability. In most high-income countries the probability of reaching e.g. 100\u00a0years increases by 50\u2013100% per decade, i.e. there is far less selection in more recent cohorts. Here we investigate the cohort specificity of variants in the APOE and FOXO3A genes by comparing the frequencies of the APOE \u03b54 allele and the minor alleles of two variants in FOXO3A at age 95+ and 100+ in 2712 individuals from the genetically homogeneous Danish birth cohorts 1895\u201396, 1905, 1910\u201311, and 1915.Generally, we find a decrease in the allele frequencies of the investigated APOE and FOXO3A variants in individuals from more recent birth cohorts. Assuming a recessive model, this negative trend is significant in 95+ year old individuals homozygous for the APOE \u03b54 allele (P\u00a0=\u00a00.026) or for the FOXO3A rs7762395 minor allele (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048). For the APOE \u03b54 allele, the significance is further strengthened when restricting to women (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Supportive, but non-significant, trends are found for two of the three tested variants in individuals older than 100\u00a0years.Altogether, this indicates that cohort differences in selection pressure on survival to the highest ages are reflected in the prevalence of longevity gene variants. Although the effect seems to be moderate, our findings could have an impact on genetic studies of human longevity.",

This often is done through caloric restriction (CR) and a variety of CR mimics have been identified that produce life extending effects without adhering to the rigorous CR dietary regimen. Glycerol is a dietary supplement capable mimicking CR by shifting metabolism away from glycolysis and towards oxidative phosphorylation. Glycerol supplementation has a number of beneficial effects, including lifespan extension, improved stress resistance, and enhanced locomotory and mitochondria activity in older age classes. Using rotifers as a model, we show that supplements of 150\u2013300\u00a0mM glycerol produced 40\u201350% extension of mean lifespan. This effect was produced by raising glycerol concentration only three times higher than its baseline concentration in rotifer tissues. Glycerol supplementation decreased rotifer reliance on glycolysis and reduced the pro-aging effects of glucose. Glycerol also acted as a chemical chaperone, mitigating damage by protein aggregation. Glycerol treatment improved rotifer swimming performance in older age classes and maintained more mitochondrial activity. Glycerol treatment provided increased resistance to starvation, heat, oxidation, and osmotic stress, but not UV stress. When glycerol was co-administered with the hexokinase inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose, the lifespan extending effect of glycerol was enhanced. Co-administration of glycerol with inhibitors like 2-deoxyglucose can lower their efficacious doses, thereby reducing their toxic side effects.",

We previously reported that a midlife-initiated regimen of moderate running was able not only to prevent the age-related decay of antioxidative and detoxification functions in mouse brain cortex, but also to preserve neurotrophic support and molecular integrity. On this basis, this work investigated whether and how a 2-mo or 4-mo midlife-initiated running protocol could affect the activity of those systems involved in maintaining neuronal function and in preventing the onset of neurodegeneration within the brain cortex of middle-aged CD-1 mice. In particular, we analyzed the production of the peptide amyloid-\u03b2 and the expression of synapsin Ia, which is known to play a key role in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. In addition, we studied the expression of sirtuin 3, as a protein marker of neuroprotection against age-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as the pro-death pathway induced by proBDNF through the interaction with p75NTR and the co-receptor sortilin.The midlife-initiated 4-mo running program triggered multiple responses within the mouse brain cortex, through the activation of anti-amyloidogenic, pro-survival, synaptogenic and neuroprotective pathways. However, most of the beneficial actions of the exercise regimen appeared only after 4\u00a0months, since 2-mo-exercised mice showed marked impairments of the endpoints we considered.

     "abstract": "Aging alters the skeletal muscle response to overload-induced growth. The onset of functional overload is characterized by increased myoblast proliferation and an altered muscle metabolic profile. The onset of functional overload is associated with increased energy demands that are met through the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate via the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Testosterone targets many of the processes activated at the onset of functional overload. However, the effect of aging on this metabolic plasticity at the onset of functional overload and how anabolic steroid administration modulates this response is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to determine if aging would alter overload-induced LDH activity and expression at the onset of functional overload and whether anabolic steroid administration would modulate this response. Five-month and 25-month male Fischer 344\u00a0x\u00a0F1 BRN were given nandrolone decanoate (ND) or sham injections for 14\u00a0days and then the plantaris was functionally overloaded (OV) for 3\u00a0days by synergist ablation. Aging reduced muscle LDH-A & LDH-B activity 70% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Aging also reduced LDH-A mRNA abundance, however there was no age effect on LDH-B mRNA abundance. In 5-month muscle, both ND and OV decreased LDH-A and LDH-B activity. However, there was no synergistic or additive effect. In 5-month muscle, ND and OV decreased LDH-A mRNA expression with no change in LDH-B expression. In 25-month muscle, ND and OV increased LDH-A and LDH-B activity. LDH-A mRNA expression was not altered by ND or OV in aged muscle. However, there was a main effect of OV to decrease LDH-B mRNA expression. There was also an age-induced LDH isoform shift. ND and OV treatment increased the \u201cfast\u201d LDH isoforms in aged muscle, whereas ND and OV increased the \u201cslow\u201d isoforms in young muscle. Our study provides evidence that aging alters aspects of skeletal muscle metabolic plasticity normally induced by overload and anabolic steroid administration.",

It possesses a wide range of biological activities including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous and local anesthetic actions. We used the well established Caenorhabditis elegans model system to elucidate the stress modulatory and lifespan prolonging action of BCP. The present study for the first time reports the lifespan extension and stress modulation potential of BCP in C. elegans. Upon evaluation, it was found that 50\u00a0\u03bcM dose of BCP increased the lifespan of C. elegans by over 22% (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.0001) and significantly reduced intracellular free radical levels, maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Moreover, the results suggest that BCP modulates feeding behavior, pharyngeal pumping and body size effectively. Further, this compound also exhibited significant reduction in intestinal lipofuscin levels. In the present investigation, we have predicted possible biological molecular targets for BCP using molecular docking approaches and BCP was found to have interaction with SIR-2.1, SKN-1 and DAF-16. The prediction was further validated in vivo using mutants and transgenic strains unraveling underlying genetic mechanism. It was observed that BCP increased lifespan of mev-1 and daf-16 but failed to augment lifespan in eat-2, sir-2.1 and skn-1 mutants. Relative quantification of mRNA demonstrated that several genes regulating oxidative stress, xenobiotic detoxification and longevity were modulated by BCP treatment. The study unravels the involvement of multiple signaling pathways in BCP mediated lifespan extension.",

Hence, the current study was designed to find out the effect of EGCG on hepatic events that prelude atherosclerosis with special reference to macrophage infiltration.Male albino rats of Wistar strain were used in this study. Basic biochemical assays along with the protein expression of CAMs, NF-\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1 and NF-AT were assayed in the current study. EGCG supplementation significantly reverted the alterations in both biochemical and histological parameters and is shown to reduce the TNF-\u03b1 mediated NF-AT expression and thereby its downstream targets like ICAM-1 and E-selectin expression to a greater extent than NF-\u03baB mediated downstream targets like VCAM-1 and P-selectin in hypercholesterolemic rat liver.Our results suggest that EGCG influences the early events of atherosclerosis that occur; thereby modulating the NF-AT pathway and thereby mitigating the hypercholesterolemic stress.",

Patients received CPX at a dose of 200\u00a0mg every 12\u00a0h as a constant rate infusion over 0.5\u00a0h. Concentrations of CPX in serum were measured by HPLC with UV detection.Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that CPX concentration versus time data were best described by a one-compartment model. The mean values of volume of distribution and clearance of CPX in the patients above 65\u00a0years of age were 78.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.17\u00a0L and 18.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.15\u00a0L/h, respectively.

     "abstract": "Osteoporosis is extremely frequent in post-menopausal women; nevertheless, osteoporosis in men is also a severe and frequently occurring but often underestimated disease. Increasing evidence links bone loss in male idiopathic osteoporosis and age related osteoporosis to osteoblast dysfunction rather than increased osteoclast activity as seen in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate gene expression of osteoblast related genes and of bone architecture in bone samples derived from elderly osteoporotic men with hip fractures (OP) in comparison to bone samples from age matched men with osteoarthritis of the hip (OA). Femoral heads and adjacent neck tissue were collected from 12 men with low-trauma hip fractures and consecutive surgical hip replacement. Bone samples of age matched patients undergoing hip replacement due to osteoarthritis served as controls. One half of the bone samples was subjected to RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time polymerase chain reactions. The second half of the bone samples was analyzed by static histomorphometry. From each half samples from four different regions, the central and subcortical region of the femoral head and neck, were analyzed. OP patients displayed a significantly decreased RUNX2, Osterix and SOST expression compared to OA patients. Major microstructural changes in OP bone were seen in the subcortical region of the neck and were characterized by a significant decrease of bone volume, and a significant increase of trabecular separation. In conclusion, decreased local gene expression of RUNX2 and Osterix in men with hip fractures strongly supports the concept of osteoblast dysfunction in male osteoporosis. Major microstructural changes in the trabecular structure associated with osteoporotic hip fractures in men are localized in the subcortical region of the femoral neck.",

Besides the DNA and lipids, proteins are frequent targets of non-enzymatic modifications by reactive substances including oxidants and glycating agents. Non-enzymatic protein modifications may alter the protein structure often leading to impaired functionality. Although proteolytic systems ensure the removal of modified proteins, the activity of these proteases was shown to decline during the aging process. The additional age-related increase of reactive compounds as a result of impaired antioxidant systems leads to the accumulation of damaged proteins and the formation of protein aggregates. Both, non-enzymatic modified proteins and protein aggregates impair cellular functions and tissue properties by a variety of mechanisms. This is increasingly important in aging and age-related diseases. In this review, we will give an overview on oxidation and glycation of proteins and the function of modified proteins in aggregate formation.

The purpose of this study is to clarify the ambiguity raised in preliminary reports as to mimetic aging dependency of the type and magnitude of oxidative damage on constituents of plasma.In the current study, we investigated the interrelationship among various groups of the systemic oxidative damage markers such as protein oxidation products (protein carbonyl groups, protein hydroperoxides, advanced oxidation protein products, protein thiol groups), lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde, lipid hydroperoxides, conjugated dienes), glycoxidation adducts (advanced glycation end products), and antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing/antioxidant power, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, total thiol, non-protein thiol). All these markers were measured in plasma of mimetically aged (MA) rats (5-month-old rats subjected to d-galactose-induced experimental aging), naturally aged (NA) rats (24-month-old), and their corresponding young controls (YC) (5\u00a0months old).Our current results show that systemic oxidation markers of the MA group share significant similarities in terms of impaired redox homeostasis with the NA rats and may be considered as a reliable experimental aging model for intravascular aging. Additional methodological studies including d-galactose dosage and application time are warranted to clarify the potential involvement of all these systemic redox variations as mechanistic factors in the development of mimetic aging related intravascular deterioration. Reversing or preventing systemic oxidative damage in experimental and natural aging should therefore be considered the primary target for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat age-related vascular disorders.",

This study rated the effect of five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in C-reactive protein (CRP) gene on the serum CRP level and handgrip strength in elderly Taiwanese. Five SNPs (rs2794520, rs1205, rs1130864, rs1800947, and rs3093059) of CRP gene were utilized to genotype 472 unrelated elderly subjects (mean age 73.8\u00a0years). Handgrip strength was measured by handgrip dynamometer (TTM Dynamometer, Tsutsumi, Tokyo). Our study demonstrated that minor alleles of rs2794520 and rs1205 were C, whereas they were T in most ethnic groups. There exist significant associations of three CRP polymorphisms (rs2794520, rs1205 and rs3093059) with serum CRP level and handgrip strength. All three had simultaneous influence on raising CRP levels and reducing handgrip strength. Genotype and sex interactions emerged for rs2794520 and rs1205 in relation to CRP levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, haplotype C-C-C-C-C was associated with higher levels of CRP (exp(\u03b2)\u00a0=\u00a01.45; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and lower handgrip strength (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.00\u00a0kg, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We conclude that SNPs rs2794520, rs1205, and rs3093059 of CRP gene, as well as haplotype C-C-C-C-C may be important biomarkers for susceptibility to low handgrip strength and high serum CRP level in elders; further studies are required.",

Although the age-associated differences in motor output variability exacerbate with more difficult tasks, it remains unknown whether task difficulty during task acquisition influences motor learning in older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the difficulty of the practice task affects motor learning in older adults. Twenty four older (72.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4\u00a0years; 11 women) and 7 young (23.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years; 1 man) adults participated in this study. Participants were divided into four groups: 8 older adults who practiced an easy task (O-Easy), 8 older adults who practiced a harder task (O-Hard), 8 older adults who did not practice (O-None), and 7 young adults who did not practice (Y-None). The level of difficulty depended on the relative timing (i.e. phase) of abduction force generation between the index and little fingers to track a moving target on the monitor. The O-Easy group practiced the task with 0\u00b0, whereas the O-Hard group practiced the task with 90\u00b0 relative phase. Practice occurred within a single session for 80 trials. Motor learning was quantified as the ability to transfer the practiced tasks to 45\u00b0, 135\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 relative phases 24 and 168\u00a0h after acquisition. Only the O-Easy group was able to significantly transfer the practiced task, as it was indicated by significantly lower force variability and error during all transfer tasks compared with the O-None group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The O-Hard group was not significantly different from the O-None group (P\u00a0>\u00a00.2). In addition, during the transfer tasks the O-Easy group exhibited performance similar to that of the young adults who did not practice. These findings suggest that practice with easier tasks may be advantageous to practice with more difficult tasks to improve motor learning in older adults.",

Hypogonadism results in the reduction of the dendritic spines of central neurons which is believed to undermine memory and cognition and cause fatigue and poor concentration. In our previous studies, we have reported age-related regression in dendrite arbors along with loss of dendritic spines in the primary somatosensory cortical neurons in female rats. Furthermore, castration caused a reduction of dendritic spines in adult male rats. In light of this, it was surmised that dendritic structures might change in normal aging male rats with advancing age. Recently, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) has been reported to have memory-enhancing properties in aged rodents. In this study, normal aging male rats, with a reduced plasma testosterone level of 75\u201380%, were used to explore the changes in behavioral performance of neuronal dendritic arbor and spine density. Aging rats performed poorer in spatial learning memory (Morris water maze). Concomitantly, these rats showed regressed dendritic arbors and spine loss on the primary somatosensory cortical and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Exogenous DHEAS and testosterone treatment reversed the behavioral deficits and partially restored the spine loss of cortical neurons in aging male rats but had no effects on the dendritic arbor shrinkage of the affected neurons. It is concluded therefore that DHEAS, has the efficacy as testosterone, and that it can exert its effects on the central neuron level to effectively ameliorate aging symptoms.",

However, most existing indices are either circular or hard to interpret biologically. Recently, we showed that statistical distance of 14 common blood biomarkers (a measure of how strange an individual's biomarker profile is) was associated with age and mortality in the WHAS II data set, validating its use as a measure of physiological dysregulation. Here, we extend the analyses to other data sets (WHAS I and InCHIANTI) to assess the stability of the measure across populations. We found that the statistical criteria used to determine the original 14 biomarkers produced diverging results across populations; in other words, had we started with a different data set, we would have chosen a different set of markers. Nonetheless, the same 14 markers (or the subset of 12 available for InCHIANTI) produced highly similar predictions of age and mortality. We include analyses of all combinatorial subsets of the markers and show that results do not depend much on biomarker choice or data set, but that more markers produce a stronger signal. We conclude that statistical distance as a measure of physiological dysregulation is stable across populations in Europe and North America.",

The glands were routinely processed and semi-quantitatively analyzed for inflammation, acinar atrophy, fibrosis, and adipocyte infiltration. Sections of labial salivary gland tissue were stained with the panneuronal marker PGP 9.5. In a subsample of 51 participants, the autonomic innervation of the glands was analyzed quantitatively by use of stereology.Labial salivary gland tissue samples from 33% of all participants displayed moderate to severe acinar atrophy and fibrosis (31%). Xerostomia was not significantly associated with structural changes of labial salivary glands, but in the subsample it was inversely related to the total nerve length in the glandular connective tissue. Acinar atrophy and fibrosis were negatively correlated with the parenchymal innervation and positively related to diffuse inflammation.The results from the present study indicate that aspects of the autonomic innervation of labial salivary glands may play a role in the occurrence of xerostomia which in the present study group was not significantly associated with degenerative changes in these glands. The findings further indicate that the integrity of labial salivary gland acini is related to the parenchymal autonomic innervation, whereas inflammatory processes may compromise it by alternative mechanisms.",

Boston RISE was performed in an outpatient rehabilitation research center and evaluated Boston area primary care patients aged 65 to 96 (N\u00a0=\u00a0364) with self-reported difficulty or task-modification climbing a flight of stairs or walking 1/2 of a mile. The outcome measure was standing balance as measured by the FICSIT-4 balance assessment. Other measures included: self-efficacy, pain, depression, executive function, vision, sensory loss, reaction time, kyphosis, leg range of motion, trunk extensor muscle endurance, leg strength and leg velocity at peak power. Participants were 67% female, had an average age of 76.5 (\u00b1\u00a07.0) years, an average of 4.1 (\u00b1\u00a02.0) chronic conditions, and an average FICSIT-4 score of 6.7 (\u00b1\u00a02.2) out of 9. After adjusting for age and gender, attributes significantly associated with balance performance were falls self-efficacy, trunk extensor muscle endurance, sensory loss, and leg velocity at peak power. FICSIT-4 balance performance is associated with a number of behavioral and physiologic attributes, many of which are amenable to rehabilitative treatment. Our findings support a consideration of balance as multidimensional activity as proposed by the current International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) model.",

     "abstract": "The growing incidence of dementia in ageing societies is a major concern of health care organizations. Because of its detrimental influence on the mental and functional statuses of elderly people, it leads to increased economic burdens caused by the social and financial needs of patients with dementia and their caregivers. There has been no data concerning the prevalence of dementia in the elderly in the general Polish community so far.The main aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of cognitive impairment suspected of dementia among the Polish elderly and the relationships between cognitive performance and age, gender, place of residence and educational status.The presented data was the result of nationwide, multicentre PolSenior Study conducted from 2007 to 2011 in the Polish elderly population.Cognitive functions were evaluated using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) performed by pre-trained nurses. The result of MMSE lower than 24 points was classified as cognitive impairment suspected of dementia and divided according to its severity into three stages: mild, moderate and severe dementia. The results were analysed in two ways: raw MMSE and MMSE scores after Mungas adjustment (MMSEadj), that is, corrected for age and educational level, and these were compared. To verify the suspicion of dementia an assessment was complemented by an interview of carers for the occurrence and course of memory disorders, treatment of dementia and by functional status assessment. In order to assess the prevalence of suspicion of dementia in the general Polish population, statistical analyses based on weighting were done.The suspicion of dementia on the basis of raw MMSE was made in 20.4% of respondents aged 65\u00a0years and more, and after Mungas adjustment in 12.1% of older subjects.The prevalence of cognitive impairment grew with increasing age, as well as depending on the educational status of elderly respondents in both types of analyses; raw MMSE and MMSEadj.There was no significant difference in the prevalence of cognitive impairment according to gender in the general population (raw MMSE); however in analyses including MMSEadj results, the suspicion of dementia was made more often among men. Suspicion of dementia based on raw MMSE and MMSEadj results was made significantly more often among men than women at the age of 65\u201369\u00a0years, and significantly more often among the oldest women, aged 90\u00a0years and more.Suspicion of dementia was diagnosed more often in respondents living in rural communities (based on raw MMSE, but not on MMSEadj), which might be related to the differences in their educational status.",

     "abstract": "Age-related deficiencies in thermoregulation diminish the capacity to defend against heat loss under conditions often encountered during activities of daily living (ADL). A potential consequence of these deficiencies is that elderly individuals could have colder lower limbs, which would exacerbate the age-related decline in plantarflexor contractile properties and compromise recovery from a tripping incident. Moreover, a common self-perception among the elderly is that their limbs are cold. However, this impression has never been documented, especially under ADL conditions. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that elderly individuals have lower plantarflexor temperatures than their younger counterparts. Skin temperatures above the plantarflexors of elderly and young individuals were continuously recorded during ADL in the winter months and compared under three conditions: quiescent indoor temperature, during a cold challenge, and the recovery period subsequent to the cold challenge. For quiescent indoor periods, differences in skin temperature between the two groups were not statistically significant. During cold exposures, both age and exposure duration were statistically significant factors related to the decrease in skin temperature, with the elderly group maintaining warmer temperatures. In the recovery period following short duration cold exposures, a statistically significant difference between the two groups for the decrease in skin temperature persisted for the first 9\u00a0min of recovery. The results do not support the hypothesis that the lower limbs of elderly participants are colder. Higher limb temperatures observed in elderly participants were consistent with previous studies of age-related thermoregulatory changes, indicating that deficiencies in vasoconstriction are persistent in ADL.",

They also had larger middle portions of ventricular bodies than those with the intermediate tertile (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018).

     "abstract": "Following active muscle shortening, the steady-state isometric torque at the final muscle length is lower than the steady-state torque obtained for a purely isometric contraction at that same final muscle length. This well-documented property of skeletal muscle is termed shortening-induced torque depression (TD). Despite many investigations into the mechanisms of weakness and power loss in old age, the influence of muscle shortening on the history dependence of isometric torque production remains to be elucidated. Thus, it is unclear whether older adults are disadvantaged for torque and power production following a dynamic shortening contraction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate shortening-induced TD in older adults, and to determine whether shortening-induced TD is related to power loss. Maximal voluntary isometric dorsiflexion contractions (MVC; 10\u00a0s) in 8 young (25.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0years) and 9 old (76.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4\u00a0years) men were performed on a HUMAC NORM dynamometer as a reference, and then again following an active shortening of 40\u00b0 joint excursion (40\u00b0PF\u20130\u00b0PF) at angular velocities of 15\u00b0/s and 120\u00b0/s. Work and instantaneous power were derived during shortening. Shortening-induced TD was calculated and expressed as a percentage by determining the mean torque value over 1\u00a0s during the isometric steady state of the MVC following shortening, divided by the mean torque value for the same 1\u00a0s time period during the isometric reference MVC. To assess muscle activation, electromyography (root mean square; EMGRMS) of the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) was calculated at identical time points used in assessing shortening-induced TD, and voluntary activation (VA) was assessed using the interpolated twitch technique. Old were 18% weaker than young for MVC, and ~\u00a040% less powerful for 15\u00b0/s and 120\u00b0/s of shortening. Old produced 37% and 21% less work for 15\u00b0/s and 120\u00b0/s than young, respectively. Furthermore, old experienced 60% and 70% greater shortening-induced TD than young for 15\u00b0/s and 120\u00b0/s, respectively with similar EMGRMS and VA across all conditions. A significant relationship between shortening-induced TD and instantaneous power was found only at the fast angular velocity for both the old (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.32) and young (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.45) men. The older men experienced greater shortening-induced TD than young while maintaining similar levels of voluntary activation. This previously unaccounted for history-dependent property of muscle may provide insight into power loss in old age.",

     "abstract": "We recently reported that young (3 to 4\u00a0months old) mice lacking Exon 1 of the Smad7 gene (S7\u0394Ex1 mice) show enhanced proliferation of neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. It remained unclear, however, whether this phenotype would persist along aging, the latter typically being associated with a profound decrease in neurogenesis. Analysis of NPCs' proliferation based on the cell cycle marker PCNA in 12\u00a0month-old S7\u0394Ex1 mice revealed a reversal of the phenotype. Hence, in contrast to their younger counterparts, 12\u00a0month-old S7\u0394Ex1 mice had a reduced number of proliferating cells, compared to wildtype (WT) mice. At the same time, the survival of newly generated cells was enhanced in the aged transgenic animals. 12\u00a0month-old S7\u0394Ex1 mice further displayed a reduced level of neurogenesis based on the numbers of cells expressing doublecortin (DCX), a marker for newborn neurons. The reduced neurogenesis in aged S7\u0394Ex1 mice was not due to a stem cell depletion, which might have occurred as a consequence of hyperproliferation in the young mice, since the number of Nestin and Sox2 positive cells was similar in WT and S7\u0394Ex1 mice. Instead, Nestin positive cells in the DG as well as primary neurosphere cultures derived from 12\u00a0month-old S7\u0394Ex1 mice had a reduced capability to proliferate. However, after passaging, when released from their age- and niche-associated proliferative block, neurospheres from aged S7\u0394Ex1 mice regained the hyperproliferative property. Further, pSmad2 antibody staining intensity was elevated in the DG and SVZ of 12-month old transgenic compared to WT mice, indicating increased intracellular TGF-beta signaling in the aged S7\u0394Ex1 mice. In summary, this points toward differential effects of S7\u0394Ex1 on neurogenesis: (i) a hyperproliferation in young animals caused by a cell autonomous mechanism, and (ii) a TGF-beta dependent modulation of neurogenesis in aged S7\u0394Ex1 animals that abrogates the cell-intrinsic hyperproliferative properties and results in reduced proliferation, increased stem cell quiescence, and enhanced survival of newly generated cells.",

     "abstract": "Mechanical loading is considered to be a major parameter of the periodontal ligament (PDL) remodeling and differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms that translate these forces to cellular responses are not fully elucidated. Especially, although aging affects PDL homeostasis, the role of cellular senescence on the activation of signaling pathways in periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) in response to mechanical stimulation has not been studied yet. Here, we present evidence showing that cyclic mechanical stimulation activates ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK in young (early-passage) human PDLF, in a RhoK-dependent manner. This response was found to be independent of the substratum (i.e. fibronectin or collagen) on which these cells grow. Stretching up-regulates also c-fos, a classical cellular response to mechanical deformation. Inhibition of ERK and JNK reduces, while that of p38 enhances stress-mediated c-fos expression. In addition, cyclic stretching stimulates the expression and activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an early marker of osteoblastic differentiation. We have recently shown that senescent human PDLF have a significantly decreased expression of ALP, linked to an inability towards osteoblastic differentiation. Here, we found that senescent PDLF are able to respond to cyclic mechanical stretching by activating ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, with similar kinetics compared to young cells, and by up-regulating c-fos and ALP expression and activity. However, even after stimulation, ALP levels in senescent cells are still much lower compared to the basal levels of their young counterparts, suggesting that senescence impairs the differentiation of human PDLF when subjected to cyclic mechanical deformation.",

     "abstract": "Adipogenesis and lipid accumulation during aging have a great impact on the aging process and the pathogenesis of chronic, age-related diseases. However, little is known about the age-related molecular changes in lipid accumulation and the mechanisms underlying them. Here, using 5-month- and 25-month-old rats (young and old, respectively), we found that epididymal fat is the only tissue to accumulate during aging. By testing tissues rich with mitochondria in old and young animals, we found that the old animals had elevated levels of triglycerides in their muscle, heart and liver tissues but not in their kidneys, while, the mRNA level of fatty acid synthase remained unchanged among the four tissues. Regarding lipid catabolism, we determined that the activities of mitochondrial ETC. complexes changed in aged rats (muscle: decreased complex I and V activities; heart: decreased complex I activity; liver: increased complex I and III activities; kidney: decreased complex I and increased complex II activities), while changes in mitochondrial content were not observed in the muscle, heart nor in the liver tissue except increased complex IV and V subunits in aged kidneys. Furthermore, decreased mitochondrial fusion marker Mfn2 and decreased PGC-1\u03b1 level were observed in the aged muscle, heart and liver but remained unchanged in the kidneys. Down-regulation of Mfn2 with siRNA in 293T cells induced significant mitochondrial dysfunction including decreased oxygen consumption, decreased ATP production, and increased ROS production, followed by increased triglyceride content suggesting a contributing role of decreased mitochondrial fusion to lipid deposit. Meanwhile, judging from autophagy marker p62/SQSTM1 and LC3-II, autophagy was suppressed in the aged muscle, heart and liver but remained unchanged in the kidneys. Taken together, these data suggest that reduction in PGC-1\u03b1 expression and disruption of mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy might contribute to lipid accumulation during aging.",

Despite the broad coverage of the proteome, no substantial changes in known age-related pathways could be observed. For a more detailed analysis, a targeted proteome analysis was applied focusing on 15 proteins from respiratory, ROS-scavenging and quality control pathways. Analyzing six distinct age-stages from juvenile to senescent P. anserina cultures revealed low, but statistically significant changes for the mitochondrial respiratory complexes.A P. anserina PaSod3 over-expression mutant with a phenotype of mitochondrial ROS over-production was used for biological evaluation of changes observed during aging. LC\u2013MS analysis of the mutant revealed severe changes to the mitochondrial proteome \u2014 substantially larger than observed during senescence. Interestingly the amount of ATP synthase subunit g, involved in cristae formation is significantly decreased in the mutant implicating ROS-induced impairments in ATP synthase dimer and cristae formation. The difference between protein-profiles of aging wild type and ROS stressed mutant suggests that oxidative stress within the mitochondria is not the dominating mechanism for the aging process in P. anserina. Collectively, while our data do not exclude an effect of ROS on specific proteins and in signaling and control of pathways which are governing aging of P. anserina, it contradicts increasing ROS as a cause of a gross general and non-selective accumulation of damaged proteins during senescence. Instead, ROS may be effective by controlling specific regulators of mitochondrial function.",

The free radical theory of aging has suggested a pivotal role for mitochondria in the aging process and previous findings established that culture in axenic medium increases metabolic rate. We asked whether axenic culture induces changes in mitochondrial functionality of C. elegans. We show that ADR induces increased electron transport chain (ETC) capacity, enhanced coupling efficiency and reduced leakiness of the mitochondria of young adult worms but not a decrease of ROS production capacity and in vivo H2O2 levels. The age-dependent increase in leak respiration and decrease in coupling efficiency is repressed under ADR conditions. Although ADR mitochondria experience a decrease in ETC capacity with age, they succeed to maintain highly efficient and well-coupled function compared to fully fed controls. This might be mediated by combination of a limited increase in supercomplex abundance and decreased individual CIV abundance, facilitating electron transport and ultimately leading to increased mitochondrial efficiency.",

     "abstract": "Aging leads to large vessel arterial stiffening and endothelial dysfunction, which are important determinants of cardiovascular risk. The aim of present work was to assess the effects of chronic aerobic exercise training on aortic stiffening and endothelial dysfunction in aged rats and investigate the underlying mechanism about mitochondrial function. Chronic aerobic exercise training attenuated aortic stiffening with age marked by reduced collagen concentration, increased elastin concentration and reduced pulse wave velocity (PWV), and prevented aging-related endothelial dysfunction marked by improved endothelium-mediated vascular relaxation of aortas in response to acetylcholine. Chronic aerobic exercise training abated oxidative stress and nitrosative stress in aortas of aged rats. More importantly, we found that chronic aerobic exercise training in old rats preserved aortic mitochondrial function marked by reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and mitochondrial swelling, increased ATP formation and mitochondrial DNA content, and restored activities of complexes I and III and electron-coupling capacity between complexes I and III and between complexes II and III. In addition, it was found that chronic aerobic exercise training in old rats enhanced protein expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 co-activator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH-2), prohibitin (PHB) and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in aortas. In conclusion, chronic aerobic exercise training preserved mitochondrial function in aortas, which, at least in part, explained the aorta-protecting effects of exercise training in aging.",

     "abstract": "Environmental stressors as well as genetic modifications are known to enhance oxidative stress and aging processes. Mitochondrial and nuclear dysfunctions contribute to the onset of aging. One of the most important redox regulators in primary human endothelial cells is Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), a 12\u00a0kD protein with additional anti-apoptotic properties. Cellular generators of reactive oxygen species are NADPH oxidases (NOXs), of which NOX4 shows highest expression levels in endothelial cells. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate how Trx-1 and NOX4 are regulated during stress-induced premature senescence in endothelial cells. We treated primary human endothelial cells for two weeks with H2O2 to generate stress-induced premature senescence in these cells. In this model senescence-associated \u03b2-Galactosidase and nuclear p21 as senescence markers are increased. Moreover, total and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species formation is enhanced. An imbalanced redox homeostasis is detected by elevated NOX4 and decreased Trx-1 levels. This can be rescued by lentiviral expression of Trx-1. Moreover, the lysosomal protease Cathepsin D is over-activated, which results in reduced Trx-1 protein levels. Inhibition of \u201cover-active\u201d Cathepsin D by the specific, cell-permeable inhibitor pepstatin A abolishes the increase in nuclear p21 protein, ROS formation and degradation of Trx-1 protein, thus leading to blockade of stress-induced premature senescence by stabilizing the cellular redox homeostasis. Aortic Trx-1 levels are decreased and Cathepsin D activity is increased in NOX4 transgenic mice exclusively expressing NOX4 in the endothelium when compared to their wildtype littermates.Thus, loss of Trx-1 and upregulation of NOX4 importantly contribute to the imbalance in the redox-status of senescent endothelial cells ex vivo and in vivo.",

Among the potential explanations of animals' lifespan variations, mitochondria and mitochondrially encoded genes have drawn attention because of their importance in the aging process. To understand both the extent of lifespan variations and their dependence to genes and amino acid variations in mitochondrial genes and DNA (mtDNA), we analyze in a systematic way all 13 proteins encoded by mitochondria in all vertebrates for which we had information on weight, maximum lifespan and mtDNA sequence. This comparison allows us to visualize positions, and even specific amino acids, in these sequences that correlate with lifespan. With this approach, we draw a map of 356 amino acid residues, at 296 positions within the sequence, that correlate with longer or shorter lifespan.

We report on a systematic study of human dermal fibroblasts retrieved from female donors aged 20\u201367\u00a0years and analysed ex vivo at low population doubling precluding replicative senescence. According to gene set enrichment analysis of genome wide array data, the most prominent age-associated change of the transcriptome was decreased expression of mitochondrial genes. Consistent with that, mitochondrial content and cell proliferation declined with donor age. This was associated with upregulation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), increased mRNA levels of PPAR\u03b3-coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC1A) and decreased levels of NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1. In the old cells the PGC1A-mediated mito-biogenetic response to direct AMPK-stimulation by AICAR was undiminished, while the PGC1A-independent mito-biogenetic response to starvation was attenuated and accompanied by increased ROS-production. In summary, these observations suggest an age-associated decline in PGC1A-independent mito-biogenesis, which is insufficiently compensated by upregulation of the AMPK/PGC1A-axis leading under baseline conditions to decreased mitochondrial content and reductive overload of residual respiratory capacity.",

All somatic cells in the adult nematode are post-mitotic and therefore do not require nuclear DNA synthesis. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replicates independently of the cell cycle and thus represents a potential target for FUdR toxicity. Inhibition of mtDNA synthesis can lead to mtDNA depletion, which is linked to a number of diseases in humans. Furthermore, alterations in mitochondrial biology can affect lifespan in C. elegans. We characterized the effects of FUdR exposure on mtDNA and nuclear DNA (nucDNA) copy numbers, DNA damage, steady state ATP levels, nematode size, mitochondrial morphology, and lifespan in the germ line deficient JK1107 glp-1(q244) and PE255 glp-4(bn2) strains. Lifespan was increased very slightly by 25\u00a0\u03bcM FUdR, but was reduced by 400\u00a0\u03bcM. Both concentrations reduced mtDNA and nucDNA copy numbers, but did not change their ratio. There was no detectable effect of FUdR on mitochondrial morphology. Although both concentrations of FUdR resulted in smaller sized animals, changes to steady-state ATP levels were either not detected or restricted to the higher dose and/or later timepoints, depending on the method employed and strain tested. Finally, we determined the half-life of mtDNA in somatic cells of adult C. elegans to be between 8 and 13\u00a0days; this long half-life very likely explains the small or undetectable impact of FUdR on mitochondrial endpoints in our experiments. We discuss the relative pitfalls associated with using FUdR and germline deficient mutant strains as tools for the experimental elimination of progeny.",

Also, mean number of mitochondrial cristae and lengths were significantly higher in all CR groups compared with controls. Finally, CR had no remarkable effects on the expression levels of fission and fusion protein markers.

On the other hand, structural or functional alterations of specific sensory neurons extend lifespan in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Hormesis is a phenomenon by which the body benefits from moderate stress of various kinds which at high doses are harmful. Several studies indicate that different stressors can hormetically extend lifespan in C. elegans and suggest that hormetic effects could be exploited as a strategy to slow down aging and the development of age-associated (neuronal) diseases in humans. Mitochondria play a central role in the aging process and hormetic-like bimodal dose\u2013response effects on C. elegans lifespan have been observed following different levels of mitochondrial stress.Here we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial stress may hormetically extend C. elegans lifespan through subtle neuronal alterations. In support of our hypothesis we find that life-lengthening dose of mitochondrial stress reduces the functionality of a subset of ciliated sensory neurons in young animals. Notably, the same pro-longevity mitochondrial treatments rescue the sensory deficits in old animals. We also show that mitochondrial stress extends C. elegans lifespan acting in part through genes required for the functionality of those neurons. To our knowledge this is the first study describing a direct causal connection between sensory neuron dysfunction and extended longevity following mitochondrial stress. Our work supports the potential anti-aging effect of neuronal hormesis and open interesting possibility for the development of therapeutic strategy for age-associated neurodegenerative disorders.",

However, activation of large-conductance Ca2\u00a0+-sensitive K+ (BKCa) channels, a putative PKA downstream target, initiated cardioprotection also in the aged heart. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether 1) BKCa channels are critically involved in PKA activation induced cardioprotection and 2) the age-dependent loss of cardioprotection is caused by differences in PKA regulation.Using an in vivo rat model with regional myocardial ischemia, we treated young (2\u20134\u00a0months) and aged (22\u201324\u00a0months) Wistar rats with PKA activator forskolin, BKCa channel activator NS1619 and/or BKCa channel blocker iberiotoxin.Forskolin induced infarct size reduction was 1) age-dependent and 2) prevented by iberiotoxin. The effect of forskolin on myocardial PKA activity was comparable in young and aged animals. In addition, NS1619 initiated cardioprotection also in the aged heart both when administered before ischemia and during early reperfusion phase.Activation of BKCa channels is critically involved in forskolin induced cardioprotection. The age-dependency of forskolin induced cardioprotection is not caused by age-dependent differences in PKA activation.

The analysis of the impact of these interventions on specific tissues will contribute to a better understanding of their mechanisms of action. The physiological functions of subcutaneous white adipose tissues are mainly fulfilled by adipocytes arising out of adipose-derived stromal/progenitor cells (ASCs), which are crucial for adipose tissue homeostasis. In the present study we analyzed ASC from age-matched long-term calorically restricted formerly obese (CRD), obese (OD) and normal weight donors (NWDs). We demonstrate that ASC derived from CRD has a significant longer replicative lifespan than ASC isolated from OD and NWD. This correlated with strongly reduced DNA-damage and improved survival of the CRD ASC, both are hallmarks of CR. The adipogenic capacity was significantly lower in ASC derived from CRD than that from OD, as shown by reduced expression of the adipogenic key regulator PPAR\u03b32 and the differentiation marker FABP4. The adipogenic capacity of ASCs from CRD and NWD differed only slightly. In conclusion, we provide evidence that bariatric surgery and diet-induced long-term CR substantially reprogram ASCs in formerly obese humans, comprising reduced DNA-damage, improved viability, extended replicative lifespan and reduced adipogenic differentiation potential.",

The nematode C. elegans responds to nutritional deprivation or harsh environmental conditions with a multitude of developmental adaptations, among them a starvation-induced quiescence at early larval development (L1). daf-18, the C. elegans homolog of the human tumor suppressor gene PTEN, is essential for the maintenance of survival and germline stem cell arrest during the L1 diapause. We show here that daf-18 mutants, independently to their failure to maintain G2 arrest of the primordial germ cells, develop a gonad phenotype after refeeding. This highly penetrant gonadal phenotype is further enhanced by a mutation in shc-1, encoding a protein homologous to the human adaptor ShcA. Features of this phenotype are a tumor-like phenotype encompassing hyper-proliferation of germ cell nuclei and disruption/invasion of the basement membrane surrounding the gonad. The penetrance of this phenotype is reduced by decreasing starvation temperature. In addition, it is also ameliorated in a dose-dependent way by exposure to the antibiotic doxycyclin either during starvation or during subsequent refeeding. Since, in eukaryotic cells, doxycyclin specifically blocks mitochondrial translation, our results suggest that daf-18 and shc-1;daf-18 mutants fail to adapt mitochondrial activity to reduced nutritional availability during early larval developing.",

     "abstract": "Free (labile or chelatable) iron is extremely redox-active and only represents a small fraction of the total mitochondrial iron population. Several studies have shown that the proportion of free iron increases with age, leading to increased Fenton chemistry in later life. It is not clear why free iron accumulates in mitochondria, but it does so in parallel with an inability to degrade and recycle damaged proteins that causes loss of mitochondrial protein homeostasis (proteostasis). The increase in oxidative damage that has been shown to occur with age might be explained by these two processes. While this accumulation of oxidative damage has often been cited as causative to ageing there are examples of model organisms that possess high levels of oxidative damage throughout their lives with no effect on lifespan. Interestingly, these same animals are characterised by an outstanding ability to maintain correct proteostasis during their entire life. ROS can damage critical components of the iron homeostasis machinery, while the efficacy of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms will determine how detrimental that damage is. Here we review the interplay between iron and organellar quality control in mitochondrial dysfunction and we suggest that a decline in mitochondrial proteostasis with age leaves iron homeostasis (where several key stages are thought to be dependent on proteostasis machinery) vulnerable to oxidative damage and other age-related stress factors. This will have severe consequences for the electron transport chain and TCA cycle (among other processes) where several components are acutely dependent on correct assembly, insertion and maintenance of iron\u2013sulphur clusters, leading to energetic crisis and death.",

Topoisomerases play an ambivalent role in nuclear genome maintenance: Deficiency compromises gene transcription, replication and chromosome segregation, while the inherent DNA-cleavage activity of the enzymes endangers DNA integrity. Indeed, many DNA-damaging agents act through enhancing topoisomerase DNA cleavage. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clearly requires topoisomerase activity for transcription and replication, because it is a closed, double-stranded DNA molecule. Three topoisomerases have so far been found in mammalian mitochondria (I, II\u03b2, III\u03b1), but their precise role in mtDNA metabolism, mitochondrial maintenance and respiratory function remains mostly unclear. It is a reasonable surmise that these enzymes exhibit similar ambiguity with respect to genome maintenance and gene transcription as their nuclear counterparts. Here, we review what is known about the physiological roles of mitochondrial topoisomerases and draft three scenarios of how these enzymes possibly contribute to ageing-related mtDNA attrition and respiratory chain dysfunction. These scenarios are: mtDNA attrition by exogenously stimulated topoisomerase DNA cleavage, unbalancing of mitochondrial and nuclear transcription by direct effects on mitochondrial transcription, and contributions to enhanced mtDNA entanglement and recombination.",

Activation of this pathway has been proposed to underlie lifespan extension from knockdown or mutation of several nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes in Caenorhabditis elegans.

It also has yet to be demonstrated that induction of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response is sufficient to increase lifespan in the absence of overt mitochondrial dysfunction. In this perspective, we briefly review the evidence for and against a direct pro-longevity role of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and suggest important areas of investigation for experimentally addressing this question.",

A reciprocal interplay exists between mitochondria and autophagy, which is needed to constantly adjust cellular energy metabolism in different pathophysiological conditions.

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are intimately involved in the aging process. The decline of autophagic clearance during aging affects the equilibrium between mitochondrial fusion and fission, leading to a build-up of dysfunctional mitochondria, oxidative stress, chronic low-grade inflammation, and increased apoptosis rates, the main hallmarks of aging. Current research suggests that a large number of microRNAs (miRs or miRNAs) are differentially expressed during cell aging. Other lines of evidence indicate that several miRs likely share in \u201cinflamm-aging\u201d, an aging-related state characterized by systemic chronic inflammation that in turn provides a biological background favoring susceptibility to age-related diseases and disabilities. Interestingly, miRs can modulate mitochondrial activity, and a discrete miR set has recently been identified in mitochondria of different species and cell types (mitomiRs). Here we show that some mitomiRs (let7b, mir-146a, -133b, -106a, -19b, -20a, -34a, -181a and -221) are also among the miRs primarily involved in cell aging and in inflamm-aging. Of note, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of aging-related mitomiR targets has disclosed a number of resident mitochondrial proteins playing large roles in energy metabolism, mitochondrial transport and apoptosis. Among these, Bcl-2 family members \u2013 which are critically involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity \u2013 may play a role in controlling mitochondrial function and dysfunction during cellular aging, also considering that Bcl-2, the master member of the family, is an anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic factor and regulates mitochondrial fission/fusion and autophagy. This intriguing hypothesis is supported by several observations: i) in endothelial cells undergoing replicative senescence (HUVECs), a well-established model of cell senescence, miR-146a, miR-34a, and miR-181a are over-expressed whereas their target Bcl-2 is down-regulated; ii) IPA of the miR-146a, miR-34a and miR-181a network shows that they are closely linked to each other, to Bcl-2 and to mitochondria; and iii) miR-146a, miR-34a, and miR-181a are involved in important cell functions (growth, proliferation, death, survival, maintenance) and age-related diseases (cancer, skeletal and muscle disorders, neurological, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases). In conclusion several aging-related mitomiRs may play a direct role in controlling mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial protein expression. Their modulation could thus mediate the loss of mitochondrial integrity and function in aging cells, inducing or contributing to the inflammatory response and to age-related diseases.",

Helicobacter pylori and Enterococcus faecalis are bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract that have been demonstrated to affect these two hallmarks. These, and other bacteria, have been shown to decrease the transcription and translation of essential DNA repair subunits of major DNA repair pathways and increase production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

However, over the last years several studies demonstrated that TERT belongs to the group of dual-targeted proteins. It contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal as well as a mitochondrial targeting sequence and, under physiological conditions, is found in both organelles in several cell types including terminally differentiated, post-mitotic cells. The canonical function of TERT is to prevent telomere erosion and thereby the development of replicative senescence and genetic instability. Besides telomere extension, TERT exhibits other non-telomeric activities such as cell cycle regulation, modulation of cellular signaling and gene expression, augmentation of proliferative lifespan as well as DNA damage responses. Mitochondrial TERT is able to reduce reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial DNA damage and apoptosis. Because of the localization of TERT in the nucleus and in the mitochondria, it must have different functions in the two organelles as mitochondrial DNA does not contain telomeric structures. However, the organelle-specific functions are not completely understood. Strikingly, the regulation by phosphorylation of TERT seems to reveal multiple parallels. This review will summarize the current knowledge about the cellular functions and post-translational regulation of the dual-targeted protein TERT.",

This very large study allowed a reappraisal of the role of both the inherited and the somatic mtDNA variability in aging, as an association with longevity emerged only when mtDNA variants in OXPHOS complexes co-occurred. Moreover, the availability of data from both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes on a large number of subjects paves the way for an evaluation at a very large scale of the epistatic interactions at a higher level of complexity.This scenario is expected to be even more clarified in the next future with the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, which are becoming applicable to evaluate mtDNA variability and, then, new mathematical/bioinformatic analysis methods are urgently needed. Recent advances of association studies on age-related diseases and mtDNA variability will also be discussed in this review, taking into account the bias hidden by population stratification.

Recent advances in the biochemical methods for studying mitochondrial functions have extended the usefulness of C. elegans for deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which mitochondria determine lifespan. Defects of all complexes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain have been described and have varied effects on lifespan. The phenotypes of these mutants indicate that the locality, production rate, and/or steady-state level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a defining lifespan-determining factor in these mutants. Mutants of enzymes involved in ROS scavenging have also been described, such as mitochondrial superoxide dismutases, and reveal a complex connection between ROS and lifespan. Energy balance, transcriptional signaling pathways, stress tolerance, and metabolic restructuring are also tied to ROS, and may also play roles in the mutants' altered lifespans.

Food intake and type of diet have also been identified as determining factors in vascular remodeling. However, the interplay between senescence and diet in vascular remodeling is largely unknown. We aimed to analyze structure of large (aorta) and small (mesenteric; MA) arteries from seven-month-old SAM prone (SAMP8) and resistant (SAMR1) mice that received a Western-type high-fat diet (WD; 8\u00a0weeks). Aortic structure was assessed by morphometric analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained cross sections, and collagen content by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence and picrosirius red. In MAs, structural and mechanical properties were measured by pressure myography; elastin and collagen content by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence; nuclei distribution by confocal microscopy; and apoptosis by qRT-PCR and TUNEL assay. In aorta, wall thickness (WT), but not cross-sectional area (CSA), was increased by senescence, and WD only increased WT in SAMR1. WD intake, but not senescence, was associated with increased collagen deposition. In MAs, senescence diminished WT and CSA, without altering collagen and elastin deposition, reduced the number of MA wall cells, and increased pro apoptotic activation. WD consumption promoted in SAMR1 the same remodeling observed with senescence, while in SAMP8 the senescence-associated changes remained unaffected. The mechanisms involved in WD-induced MA remodeling in SAMR1 mimicked those observed in senescence per se. Our study reveals qualitatively different remodeling in aortas and MAs from senescent mice. Consumption of a WD induced remodeling of the SAMR1 vasculature similar to that induced by senescence, while it did not promote any further alteration in the latter. Therefore, we propose that increased consumption of fat-enriched diets could promote accelerated senescence of the non-senescent vasculature, although it does not exacerbate vascular remodeling during senescence.",

Mice in the stress and stress with chewing groups were placed in a ventilated restraint tube for 60\u00a0minutes, twice a day for 4\u00a0weeks. The restrained mice were simultaneously subjected daily to one of the following stressors: water immersion, physical shaking and flashing lights. Mice in the stress with chewing group were allowed to chew a wooden stick during the experimental period. After the experiment, the bone response was evaluated using quantitative micro computed tomography, bone histomorphometry, and biochemical markers. Exposure of SAMP8 mice to chronic stress resulted in significant increase of the blood corticosterone and noradrenaline levels, and adrenal weight. The bone resorption was activated and the bone formation was suppressed. Trabecular bone volume and trabecular number were decreased in both the vertebra and distal femur of the stress group. Chewing under chronic stress prevented the increase in the blood corticosterone and noradrenaline levels, attenuated the reduced bone formation and increased bone resorption, improved the trabecular bone loss and bone microstructural deterioration induced by chronic mild stress. These findings indicate that chewing can ameliorate chronic stress-induced bone loss in SAMP8 mice.

Our combined methodological approach encompassed atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization of cortical bone nano-structure, assessment of mineral content/distribution via quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI), measurement of bone material properties by reference point indentation, as well as evaluation of cortical micro-architecture and osteocyte lacunar density. Our findings revealed a wide range of differences between the fracture group and the controls, suggesting a number of detrimental changes at various levels of cortical bone hierarchical organization that may render bone fragile. Namely, mineral crystals at external cortical bone surfaces of the fracture group were larger (65.22\u00a0nm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041.21\u00a0nm vs. 36.75\u00a0nm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.49\u00a0nm, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and a shift to a higher mineral content and more homogenous mineralization profile as revealed via qBEI were found in the bone matrix of the fracture group. Fracture cases showed nearly 35% higher cortical porosity and showed significantly reduced osteocyte lacunar density compared to controls (226\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027 vs. 247\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032\u00a0#/mm2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Along with increased crystal size, a shift towards higher mineralization and a tendency to increased cortical porosity and reduced osteocyte lacunar number delineate that cortical bone of the superolateral femoral neck bears distinct signs of fragility at various levels of its structural organization.

     "abstract": "Contribute evidence towards the complex interrelationships of body composition, physical performance and physical activity (PA) in an older population to assist in decisions for maintaining functional capacity in older adults.This is a cross-sectional analysis of an existing dataset in which a literature-supported model linking together the variables of interest is tested using path analysis. A proposed model with age, sex, energy intake and chronic diseases as predictors associated with body composition components, while the latter associated with physical performance and with PA acting both as a predictor and as an outcome of physical performance.A sample of 847, community dwellers, non-diabetic older men and women from the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging (NuAge Study).Physical performance tests were reduced to two indices: strength and mobility. Muscle mass index (MMI; kg/height2) and % body fat were derived from DXA and bioimpedance analysis (BIA). PA was assessed by the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and energy intakes were calculated from 24-hour food recalls. Data from the NuAge dataset served to test the relationships. The proposed model was evaluated using indices of fit.Significant associations were found for MMI and % body fat with mobility (\u03b2 \u2212\u00a00.11 and \u2212\u00a00.02, respectively), and for MMI with strength (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.60). PA was associated with MMI (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and negatively with % body fat (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.16), while mobility associated with PA (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.65). Our hypothesized model, with some paths added, fit the data: chi-square\u00a0=\u00a04.64, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)\u00a0=\u00a00.PA has desirable associations with body composition in older adults and mobility is associated with PA. These results stress the importance of taking into account the prior level of mobility when recommending PA for this age group. This model could explain in part the complex interrelationships that occur with aging and the potential factors that could be targeted to assist older individuals in maintaining functional capacity.",

     "abstract": "Age-related impairment of neuromuscular activation has been shown to contribute to weakness in older adults. However, it is unclear to what extent impaired neuromuscular activation independently accounts for decline of mobility function. The hypothesis of this study is that the capability to produce rapid neuromuscular activation during maximal effort leg muscle contractions will be shown to be an independent predictor of mobility function in older men and women after accounting for muscle size and adiposity, body composition and age. Twenty six older men and eighteen older women (aged 70\u201385\u00a0years) participated in this study. Mobility function was assessed by the 400-m walk test. Neuromuscular activation of the quadriceps muscle group was assessed by surface electromyography (\u201crate of EMG rise\u201d). Thigh muscle cross sectional area and adiposity were assessed by computed tomography. In males, univariate regression analysis revealed strong associations between walking speed and a number of predictors including age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), muscle area (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), intermuscular adipose tissue area (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and rate of EMG rise (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Subsequent multiple regression analysis with all variables accounted for 72% of the variability in walking speed (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), with age and rate of EMG rise as the dominant variables in the model. In females, univariate analysis showed a significant association only between walking speed and subcutaneous adipose tissue area (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Multiple regression analysis accounted for only 44% of the variability in walking speed, and was not statistically significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.18). The present findings indicate that the capability to rapidly activate the quadriceps muscle group is an important factor accounting for inter-individual variability of walking speed among older men, but not among older women. This research is important for informing the design of assessments and interventions that seek to detect and prevent impairments that contribute to age-related mobility disability.",

The effect of DNJ on senescence of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) promoted under high glucose condition was determined. HUVECs were cultured in normal glucose (5.6\u00a0mmol/L, NG group), normal glucose plus DNJ (10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, DNJ group), high glucose (30\u00a0mmol/L, HG group), or high glucose plus DNJ (10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, HG\u00a0+\u00a0DNJ group) and passaged until they reached senescence. The proliferation rate was markedly decreased in the HG group compared with the NG group, and this phenomenon was reversed by DNJ. The frequency of senescent (SA-\u00df-Gal-positive) cells and the expression level of senescence genes (PAI-1 and p21) were significantly higher in the HG group compared with the NG group, and these changes were blocked by DNJ. Monocyte adhesion, NF-kB activity, and reactive oxygen species production, all of which promote cellular senescence, were significantly increased in the HG group compared with the NG group, and again these changes were blocked by DNJ. Therefore, these results show that DNJ delays cellular senescence that is promoted under high glucose condition.",

     "abstract": "Studies on the molecular clockwork during aging have been hitherto addressed to core clock genes. These previous investigations indicate that circadian profiles of core clock gene expression at an advanced age are relatively preserved in the master circadian pacemaker and the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and relatively impaired in peripheral tissues. It remains to be clarified whether the effects of aging are confined to the primary loop of core clock genes, or also involve secondary clock loop components, including Rev-erb\u03b1 and the clock-controlled genes Dbp and Dec1. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we here report a comparative analysis of the circadian expression of canonical core clock genes (Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2, Clock and Bmal1) and non-core clock genes (Rev-erb\u03b1, Dbp and Dec1) in the SCN, liver, and heart of 3\u00a0month-old vs 22\u00a0month-old mice. The results indicate that circadian clock gene expression is significantly modified in the SCN and peripheral oscillators of aged mice. These changes are not only highly tissue-specific, but also involve different clock gene loops. In particular, we here report changes of secondary clock loop components in the SCN, changes of the primary clock loop in the liver, and minor changes of clock gene expression in the heart of aged mice. The present findings outline a track to further understanding of the role of primary and secondary clock loop components and their crosstalk in the impairment of circadian output which characterizes aging.",

     "abstract": "Domination of cell proliferation over cell death is a driving force for carcinogenesis, whereas reduced cell proliferation and increased cell death are characteristic of ageing. We employed published data to estimate representative mean values of cell turnover times for 31 different organs and tissues in adult humans and animals (when data in humans were lacking) as well as functional mass loss for 5 organs, accounting for actual mass loss and tissue conversion to fat, in humans over the adult period, age 25 to 70. We found that greater actual and functional mass loss was significantly associated (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, respectively) with the log of shorter cell turnover times. We propose that this is characteristic of stem cell exhaustion and replicative senescence. In addition, we provide quantitative evidence that, in many organs, involution is evident even in young adults. On the basis of published mass measurements of major organs, by analysis of covariance, we identified examples of significant (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05), accelerated actual or functional mass loss and ageing from early to late adulthood. We hypothesise and quantitatively demonstrate that functional mass loss accelerates with ageing by incorporating the contribution of actual mass loss, tissue conversion to fatty or fibrous tissue, and the presence of apoptotic, necrotic and senescent cells. We propose that mass loss, linked to replicative senescence, is an evolutionary adaptation that effectively limits cancer in young adults, as mass loss is first apparent soon after the end of the growth period, accelerating in the more elderly as biological conditions deviate away from those prevailing in youth, when the selective pressure on pleiotropic genes is greatest.",

Paradoxically, older adults are less fatigable than young adults in some tasks. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of age on fatigability of the dorsiflexors and to evaluate the ecological validity of this test by comparing it to motor function subdomains known to decline with advancing age. The community-dwelling older adults (n\u00a0=\u00a052, 75.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0years) were more fatigable than young adults (n\u00a0=\u00a026, 22.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0years), as assessed by endurance time for supporting a submaximal load (20% of one-repetition maximum; 1-RM) with an isometric contraction of the dorsiflexor muscles (8.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0min and 15.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0min, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), including participants matched for 1-RM load and sex (Y: 13.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0min, O: 8.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0min, n\u00a0=\u00a011 pairs, 6 women, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). When the older adults were separated into two groups (65\u201375 and 76\u201390\u00a0years), however, only endurance time for the oldest group was less than that for the other two groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). All measures of motor function were significantly correlated (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with dorsiflexor endurance time for the older adults, and multiple regression analysis revealed that the variance in endurance time was most closely associated with age, steadiness, and knee flexor strength (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.50, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

In addition, we were interested in comparing the extent of correlation between questionnaire and accelerometer determined PA.636 community-dwelling older adults (66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0years) were studied. Adiposity was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and BMI was calculated. We measured minutes/day spent in sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous intensity activity using both questionnaires and Actigraph GT1M accelerometers.Participants spent a median of 583(IQR 522\u2013646), 225(176\u2013271), 27(12\u201345) and 0(0\u20130) minutes in sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous activities respectively. There was a non linear dose\u2013response inverse relationship between activity intensity and adiposity. After adjusting for age, sex and other levels of PA, for every 10\u00a0minute increase in activity, total body fat decreased by 169\u00a0g(95% CI 61\u2013277), 905\u00a0g(632\u20131178), and 2208\u00a0g(759\u20133657) for light, moderate and vigorous activities respectively. There was an interaction between age and activity; as age increased, the magnitude of the effects of light and moderate activities on adiposity decreased. Sedentary minutes were not associated with adiposity after adjusting for time spent at other PA intensities. Questionnaire measures of PA were weakly correlated with body fat measures when compared to accelerometer determined PA.Both the amount and intensity of PA, but not sedentary time, have an independent dose\u2013response association with adiposity. The association is much stronger using objective assessment compared to questionnaire. The magnitude of these associations decrease with age suggesting that physical activity programmes may need to be modified with increasing age.",

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as immunosenescence. However, this theory is still not well defined. Non-human primates serve as a favorable model to facilitate the study in aging of the immune system. Here, we investigated the phenotypic features of T- and B-cell aging in peripheral blood from Chinese rhesus macaques, which included (1) a decrease of CD4/CD8 ratio; (2) a loss of na\u00efve T cells accompanied with elevated proliferation and expansion of effector memory subset; (3) a reduction in B cell numbers and a shift from na\u00efve B cells towards memory phenotype; and (4) increased levels of PD-1 expression in T cells and CD95 expression in B cells. Moreover, an accelerated decline in CD4+ T cells and na\u00efve T cells was found in male macaques, giving them a more severe immune risk profile. These data indicated that Chinese rhesus macaques share a significant homology with humans in phenotypic aging of adaptive immunity, and may be an appropriate animal model for human aging research.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia is characterized by increased skeletal muscle atrophy due in part to alterations in muscle metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of skeletal muscle metabolic pathways which regulate many cellular processes that are disrupted in old-age. Functional AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits, and each subunit can be represented in the heterotrimer by one of two (\u03b11/\u03b12, \u03b21/\u03b22) or three (\u03b31/\u03b32/\u03b33) isoforms. Altered isoform composition affects AMPK localization and function. Previous work has shown that overall AMPK activation with endurance-type exercise is blunted in old vs. young skeletal muscle. However, details regarding the activation of the specific isoforms of AMPK, as well as the heterotrimeric composition of AMPK in old skeletal muscle, are unknown. Our purpose here, therefore, was to determine the effect of old-age on 1) the activation of the \u03b11 and \u03b12 catalytic subunits of AMPK in skeletal muscle by a continuous contraction bout, and 2) the heterotrimeric composition of skeletal muscle AMPK. We studied gastrocnemius (GAST) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles from young adult (YA; 8\u00a0months old) and old (O; 30\u00a0months old) male Fischer344\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats after an in situ bout of endurance-type contractions produced via electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve (STIM). AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation and AMPK\u03b11 and \u03b12 activities were unaffected by age at rest. However, AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation and AMPK\u03b12 protein content and activity were lower in O vs. YA after STIM. Conversely, AMPK\u03b11 content was greater in O vs. YA muscle, and \u03b11 activity increased with STIM in O but not YA muscles. AMPK\u03b33 overall concentration and its association with AMPK\u03b11 and \u03b12 were lower in O vs. YA GAST. We conclude that activation of AMPK\u03b11 is enhanced, while activation of \u03b12 is suppressed immediately after repeated skeletal muscle contractions in O vs. YA skeletal muscle. These changes are associated with changes in the AMPK heterotrimer composition. Given the known roles of AMPK \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b33, this may contribute to sarcopenia and associated muscle metabolic dysfunction.",

     "abstract": "2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is one of the principal endocannabinoids involved in the protection against neurodegenerative processes. Cannabinoids primarily interact with the seven-segment transmembrane cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), both of which are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). The level of 2-AG is controlled through key enzymes responsible for its synthesis or degradation. We have previously observed a deregulation of 2-AG metabolism in physiological aging. The aim of this study was to analyze how 2-AG metabolism is modulated by CB1/CB2 receptors during aging. To this end, both CB1 and CB2 receptor expression and the enzymatic activities (diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL), lysophosphatidate phosphohydrolase (LPAase) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL)) involved in 2-AG metabolism were analyzed in the presence of cannabinoid receptor (CBR) agonists (WIN and JWH) and/or antagonists (SR1 and SR2) in synaptosomes from adult and aged rat cerebral cortex (CC). Our results demonstrate that: (a) aging decreases the expression of both CBRs; (b) LPAase inhibition, due to the individual action of SR1 or SR2, is reverted in the presence of both antagonists together; (c) LPAase activity is regulated mainly by the CB1 receptor in adult and in aged synaptosomes while the CB2 receptor acquires importance when CB1 is blocked; (d) modulation via CBRs of DAGL and MAGL by both antagonists occurs only in aged synaptosomes, stimulating DAGL and inhibiting MAGL activities; (e) only DAGL stimulation is reverted by WIN. Taken together, the results of the present study show that CB1 and/or CB2 receptor antagonists trigger a significant modulation of 2-AG metabolism, underlining their relevance as therapeutic strategy for controlling endocannabinoid levels in physiological aging.",

Numbers and proliferative activity of dermal fibroblast-like cells were also examined. Blood vessels were viewed with immunohistochemical staining for von Willebrand factor or CD31.

Results showed that the numbers of fibroblast-like cells, PCNA positive fibroblast-like cells, von Willebrand factor positive or CD31 positive blood vessels in dermis are dramatically decreased with age. The intensity of immunohistochemical staining for VEGF or Jag-1 in blood vessels of dermis is increased from antenatal to deep old period.

Highly visible edge highlighters/friction strips (often set back from the tread edge) are sometimes used to improve stair safety, but there is no evidence for the usefulness of either.To determine whether an edge highlighter and its location relative to the tread edge affect foot placement/clearance and accidental foot contacts when descending stairs.Sixteen older adults (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0SD age; 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0years) with normal vision (experiment 1) and eight young adults (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0SD age; 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years) with visual impairment due to simulated age-related cataract (experiment 2) completed step descent trials during which a high contrast edge highlighter was either not present, placed flush with the tread edge, or set back from the edge by 10\u00a0mm or 30\u00a0mm. Foot placement/clearance and the number of accidental foot contacts were compared across conditions.In experiment 1, a highlighter set back by 30\u00a0mm led to a reduction in final foot placement (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and foot clearance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to a highlighter placed flush with the tread edge, and the percentage of foot clearances that were less than 5\u00a0mm increased from 2% (abutting) to 17% (away30). In experiment 2, a highlighter placed flush with the tread edge led to a decrease in within-subject variability in final foot placement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and horizontal foot clearance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022), a decrease in descent duration (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), and a decrease in the number of low clearances (<\u00a05\u00a0mm, from 8% to 0%) and the number of accidental foot contacts (15% to 3%) when compared to a tread edge with no highlighter present.Changes to foot clearance parameters as a result of highlighter presence and position suggest that stairs with high-contrast edge highlighters positioned flush with the tread edge will improve safety on stairs, particularly for those with age-related visual impairment.",

As aging is a key factor in the progression of this condition, it is hypothesized that animals may vary in their responses to ACLT according to their age. The histopathological features of young (2\u00a0month-old) and middle-aged (12\u00a0month-old) rats in the presence or absence of ACLT were compared. The results indicated that moderate degradative changes can be detected in the knee joints of sham-operated middle-aged rats compared with young animals. After ACLT, cartilage degradation was significantly higher in middle-aged rats in relation to young animals. An increase in interleukin(IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-17 suggests the presence of a local inflammatory response represented by synovitis in ACLT rats which is not dependent on age. Our study indicates that age is an important factor affecting the pathogenesis of OA changes after ACLT and it should be considered in studies using this experimental model.",

     "abstract": "The knowledge of dyslipidemia and its genetic contributors in oldest-old subjects is limited; in addition, the majority of oldest-old subjects are females. Evidence has accumulated that multiple genetic factors play important roles in determining susceptibility to dyslipidemia and extended life span. Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) are two plausible candidate genes for human longevity owing to their functionally related modulation of circulating lipid homeostasis; however, few studies have considered their interplay. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of CETP*V (rs5882) and APOE*4 (rs429358 and rs7412) in 372 oldest-old Chinese women (aged 80\u2013109) and 340 controls (aged 20\u201358). In addition to replicating the association of longevity, our main goal was to evaluate the contribution of CETP*V, APOE*4 and CETP*APOE interaction to the risk of dyslipidemia. Only APOE*4 conferred a risk against longevity and was associated with high-cholesterol (hTC) and mixed dyslipidemia for oldest-old females. Moreover, CETP*V was found to be associated with hypertriglyceridemia (hTG) independently from APOE*4, age, BMI, alcohol drinking, TC, TG, HDL-c, and LDL-c. The stratification test, multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, and nonparametric MDR analysis all suggested a significant CETP*APOE interaction associated with hTG. The unadjusted odds for hTG were more than 4-fold in subjects with CETP*V and APOE*4 than those without either (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.36, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). These results provide evidence of strong independent associations between hTG and CETP*V in oldest-old Chinese females, and APOE*4, as an independently non-significant variant, might interact with CETP*V resulting in an increased risk for hTG.",

Both innate and adaptive immunity are affected in a manner assumed to be deleterious, but often the clinical consequences of the assessed changes are unclear or not even investigated. The mechanisms accounting for these changes, and biomarkers of immunosenescence, are currently the subject of intensive research. Cross-sectional studies have established hallmark age-associated differences between adaptive immune factors in young and old people, particularly a lower number and percentage of na\u00efve T cells, especially CD8\u00a0+ T cells, and accumulations of late-differentiated CD8\u00a0+ T cells. The latter but not the former is strongly affected by infection with the persistent \u00df-herpesvirus HHV5 (cytomegalovirus, CMV). Only limited longitudinal studies have so far investigated whether these differences actually reflect age-associated changes at the individual level. The Swedish OCTO/NONA-Immune studies identified a set of immune parameters including infection with CMV which predicted survival in people over 85 at baseline. Moreover, the Leiden 85\u00a0+ study showed that T cell-mediated pro-inflammatory specific for CMV antigens was enriched in very old survivors, suggesting the overarching necessity of maintaining effective immunosurveillance of this virus.

     "abstract": "Centenarians are rare and exceptional individuals characterized by a peculiar phenotype. They are the best example of healthy aging in humans as most of them have escaped or substantially delayed the onset of major age-related diseases. Within this scenario, the purpose of the present work was to understand if immune status is associated with survival and health status in centenarians. To this aim, 116 centenarians were concomitantly characterized for their immunological, health and functional status, and followed-up for five-year survival. On the basis of previous knowledge we focused on a core of fundamental and basic immune parameters (number of leukocytes, monocytes, total lymphocytes, CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD4+ helper T lymphocytes, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD19+ B lymphocytes and plasma levels of IgM), and the most important findings can be summarized as follows: i. a hierarchical cluster analysis was able to define Cluster1 (88 centenarians) and Cluster2 (28 centenarians) characterized by low and high values of all these immune parameters, respectively; ii. centenarians of Cluster2 showed a statistically longer five-year survival and more favorable values of other important immune (na\u00efve, activated/memory and effector/memory T cells) and metabolic (glycemia, insulin and HOMA-IR) parameters, in accord with previous observations that centenarians have a peculiar immune profile, a preserved insulin pathway and a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes; and iii. unexpectedly, parameters related to frailty, as well as functional and cognitive status, did not show any significant correlation with the immune clustering, despite being capable per se of predicting survival. In conclusion, high values of basic immunological parameters and important T cell subsets correlate with five-year survival in centenarians, independent of other phenotypic characteristics. This unexpected biological scenario is compatible with the general hypothesis that in centenarians a progressive disconnection and loss of biological coherence among the different functions of the body occur, where survival/mortality result from the failure of any of these domains which apparently follow an independent age-related trajectory.",

     "abstract": "Influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are two major pathogens that lead to significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Since both pathogens enter the host via the mucosa, especially the upper respiratory tract (URT), it is essential to elicit pathogen-specific secretory IgA (SIgA) antibody (Ab) responses at mucosal surfaces for defense of the elderly. However, as aging occurs, alterations in the mucosal immune system of older individuals result in a failure to induce SIgA Abs for protection from these infections. To overcome mucosal immunosenescence, we have developed a mucosal dendritic cell targeting, novel double adjuvant system which we show to be an attractive and effective immunological modulator. This system induces a more balanced Th1- and Th2-type cytokine response which supports both mucosal SIgA and systemic IgG1 and IgG2a Ab responses. Thus, adaptation of this adjuvant system to nasal vaccines for influenza virus and S. pneumoniae could successfully provide protection by supporting pathogen-specific SIgA Ab responses in the URT in the mouse model of aging. In summary, a double adjuvant system is considered to be an attractive and potentially important strategy for the future development of mucosal vaccines for the elderly.",

We assessed immune function in 101 hip fracture patients (81 female) 6\u00a0weeks and 6\u00a0months after injury and 43 healthy age matched controls (28 females). Thirty-eight of the hip fracture group were found to be depressed at the 6\u00a0week sampling.

Here, we focus on the role of tissue-associated innate immune cells including antigen presenting cells (i.e. dendritic cells and macrophages), myeloid derived suppressor cells and neutrophils in healthy and cancer-bearing elderly hosts. Most cancers, including the cancers that we are interested in, i.e. lung carcinomas and mesothelioma, emerge in aging populations at a time when na\u00efve T cell function is declining. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes are critical anti-tumor effector cells, and their diminished function may contribute to cancer escape mechanisms in the elderly. Therefore, we compare the likely consequences of innate immune cell interactions with T cells in young versus elderly hosts. We examine data showing that elderly-derived innate cells are highly immunosuppressive and may provide a more tumorigenic milieu than their younger counterparts. Standard chemotherapy often only provides these patients a few extra months survival time. Recent evidence has shown that standard chemotherapy is not as effective in hosts devoid of T cells. Therefore, T cell dysfunction in the elderly may contribute to poor treatment outcomes. However, there is also evidence that T cell immunity can be rejuvenated via activated dendritic cells and/or macrophages. Combining \u2018rejuvenation\u2019 immunotherapy with standard chemotherapy may offer an improved outcome for elderly cancer patients. We explore this potential herein.",

     "abstract": "Advanced age is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation (i.e. inflamm-aging) and poor macrophage function that includes a weak pro-inflammatory cytokine response to bacteria and diminished phagocytosis (i.e. age-dependent macrophage dysfunction [ADMD]). One reason for this is that ADMD is associated with poor NF\u03baB and MAPK activation following Toll-like receptor stimulation. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that inflamm-aging induces production of A20, a cytosolic and homeostatic suppressor of the NF\u03baB and MAPK signaling cascades that deubiquitinates (i.e. inactivates) the common upstream signaling molecule TRAF6, and this is responsible for ADMD. Western blots and immunohistochemistry comparing tissues from young, mature, and aged C57BL/6 mice indicated that A20 was strongly elevated in the lungs of aged mice but not in other tissues. Elevated A20 was also detected in alveolar macrophages (AM) from aged mice. In contrast CYLD, a second deubiquitinase that also negatively regulates the NF\u03baB pathway was decreased with aging. Following co-incubation of AM with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, TRAF6 polyubiquitination was diminished in AM isolated from aged versus young mice. A20 production was inducible in the J774A.1 macrophage cell line and C57BL/6\u00a0AM by overnight incubation with TNF\u03b1 but not IL-6. Retrovirus-induced expression of A20 in J774A.1 cells resulted in their diminished production of IL-6 following exposure to S. pneumoniae but had no effect on levels of phagocytosis. Overnight incubation of AM from young mice with TNF\u03b1 also resulted in a dampened IL-6 response to S. pneumoniae. Finally, dietary supplementation of aged mice with anti-inflammatory n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the form of fish oil lowered lung A20 levels and enhanced resistance, including a 100-fold reduction in bacterial titers in the lungs, to experimental challenge with S. pneumoniae. We conclude that elevated A20 due to TNF\u03b1 partially explains the ADMD phenotype and that ADMD is potentially reversible.",

We find delayed and reduced development of CD4 T follicular help (Tfh) cells in aged mice in response to influenza infection with reduction of long-lived plasma cells.

In this review, we review the role of the thymus in the maintenance of T cell homeostasis throughout life and contrast the differences in mice and humans. We propose that in humans, lack of thymic T cell generation does not explain a decline in T cell receptor diversity nor would thymic rejuvenation restore diversity.

Macroautophagy has been shown to protect cells from unfavorable environmental conditions and extend lifespan of various cells and organisms. In this study, we investigated autophagy in CD8+CD28+ and CD8+CD28\u2212 T cells following T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. We demonstrate that TCR-mediated activation led to a potent induction of autophagy in CD8+CD28+ T cells which was accompanied by an increased activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). This was surprising, as mTORC1 is generally perceived as an inhibitor of autophagy. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin could still enhance activation-induced autophagy. In contrast, CD8+CD28\u2212 T cells induced autophagy to a significantly lower extent in response to TCR engagement compared to CD8+CD28+ T cells and failed to increase autophagy upon mTORC1 inhibition. In conclusion, we describe for the first time the induction of autophagy in human CD8+ T cells following TCR engagement and the decreased ability of CD8+CD28\u2212 T cells to induce autophagy, suggesting that they cannot meet the metabolic needs of antigen receptor-mediated activation and are therefore unlikely to survive when confronted by their specific antigens.",

Recent studies suggest detectable CMV DNA in peripheral monocytes as a better indicator for this persistent viral infection than anti-CMV IgG serology. Here, we conducted longitudinal comparisons of anti-CMV IgG titers, CMV DNA in the peripheral monocytes, serum IL-6 levels, and CMV pp65 (NLV)-specific CD8+ T-cell frequencies in fifteen community-dwelling older women with twelve year follow-up. The results showed that anti-CMV IgG titers did not change over twelve years. Women with detectable CMV DNA had significantly higher IL-6 levels than those without, both at baseline (3.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58 vs 1.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37\u00a0pg/ml, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and at the follow-up (3.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.66 versus 0.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37\u00a0pg/ml, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In addition, CMV pp65 (NLV)-specific CD8+ T cells were detected only in women who had CMV DNA with similar frequencies at both time points. These findings indicate that anti-CMV IgG serology is neither sensitive to change nor useful for monitoring chronic CMV infection over time. They also provide a basis for further investigation into chronic CMV infection as defined by detectable CMV DNA in the peripheral monocytes and its impact on immunity and health in the elderly.",

They represent therefore the primary source to mount an immune response against pathogens or tumors. Recent evidence of both quantitative and qualitative alterations of na\u00efve T cells has accumulated in aged mice, indicating that the successful generation of primary T cell responses from the na\u00efve T cell pool may be compromised with old age. However, the vast majority of the data supporting compromised na\u00efve T cell priming efficacy with old age have been produced in animal models, and the situation is much less clear in humans. In the elderly, the involution of the thymus and the associated decline in thymic output result in a decreased number of na\u00efve T cells, which is partially compensated by homeostatic proliferation. Emerging evidence suggest that alterations of the TCR repertoire diversity and intrinsic defects of old CD4+ na\u00efve T cells may impact on their responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. Increasing focus on the study of na\u00efve T cells (in particular CD8+) in old humans are needed to fill the gaps in our understanding of reduced cellular immunity with aging.",

     "abstract": "Infection with Cytomegalovirus is associated with accelerated immunosenescence. Expansions of CMV-specific T cell responses have previously been demonstrated to affect the ability of T cells to respond to other infections. Most people above 60\u00a0years of age display M. tuberculosis-specific immunity because of vaccination, exposure, or both. T-cell responses can be assessed by measuring intracellular IFN-\u03b3 in vitro after tuberculin stimulation. Here we investigated tuberculin-specific CD4 T-cell responses in independently living healthy older people in the South of England using flow-cytometry. Individuals were investigated for tuberculin and CMV-specific T-cell immunity using in vitro antigen stimulation followed by intracellular staining for IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL2, as well as degranulation and CD154 upregulation. We also examined a control group of younger individuals (20\u201335\u00a0years of age). There was no significant difference between older and young people in regards to tuberculin responsiveness of CD4 T-cells; however, older people seemed to show more outliers. Increased responsiveness to tuberculin was significantly correlated to CMV responsiveness but not age. In older donors, the memory phenotype of tuberculin-induced T-cells was significantly skewed towards a more terminal differentiation phenotype in CMV-infected compared to uninfected individuals and the degree of skewing correlated quantitatively with the size of the CMV-specific CD4 T-cell response. This is a fundamental advance over previous reports of changes of the tuberculin-specific CD4 T-cell response with CMV serostatus. Our results show that how the immune system responds to CMV has a fundamental impact on the phenotype and function of the immune response to mycobacterial antigens in older life.",

     "abstract": "Poor immune protection upon vaccination is a critical determinant of immunosenescence. Latent Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been associated with poor antibody responses to vaccination, but a causative role for CMV in the poor immune response requires experimental evidence and thus could not be confirmed in clinical studies. To test the hypothesis that latent CMV infection causes poor antibody responses, we infected young or adult mice with mouse CMV and challenged them with Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) at 15 or 18\u00a0months of age. Latent, but not primary infection with mouse CMV resulted in diminished neutralizing titers of the serum IgG fraction at day 7 post challenge, which recovered by day 14 post challenge. This phenomenon was specific for mice infected with mouse CMV, but not mice infected with other herpesviruses, like murine herpesvirus-68 or herpes simplex virus type 1, or mice infected with non-persistent viruses, such as influenza or Vaccinia virus. Hence, our data indicate a delay in IgG class-switch that was specific for the CMV infection. Herpesviral infections did not change the B-cell memory compartment, and increased the size of the effector-memory subset of blood CD4 T-cells only when administered in combination. Furthermore, CD4 T-cell response to VSV infection was maintained in latently infected mice. Therefore, our results argue that latent CMV infection impairs B-cell, but not T-cell responses to a challenge with VSV and delays antibody class-switch by a mechanism which may be independent of T-cell help.",

In aged mice, we observe significant reductions of high-affinity clones among GCB cells, but not nascent swBmem cells. The defect in GC affinity maturation was not overcome by providing excess carrier-specific T cells from young mice, as these cells still displayed compromised effector TFH differentiation in the aged animals. Our results suggest that B cells in aged animals have a reduced ability to prompt effector TFH differentiation, leading to a compromised GC response that results in reduced generation of high-affinity GCB and plasma cells; despite normal production of early swBmem cells.",

Based on our previous data in aged mice, we hypothesize that the inflammatory status of the individual and of B cells themselves would impact B cell function. We here show that the ability to generate a vaccine-specific antibody response is negatively correlated with levels of serum TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, human unstimulated B cells from elderly make higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 than those from young individuals, and these positively correlate with serum TNF-\u03b1 levels. These all negatively correlate with B cell function, measured by activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the enzyme of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. Only memory B cells (either IgM or switched), but not na\u00efve B cells, make appreciable levels of TNF-\u03b1 and more in elderly as compared to young individuals. Finally, an anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody can increase the response in cultured B cells from the elderly, suggesting that TNF-\u03b1 secreted by memory B cells affects IgM memory B cells and na\u00efve B cells in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner.

Age-associated changes in NK cell phenotype have been previously reported that can be responsible of functional NK cell deficiency. The aim of this work was to analyze the effect CMV seropositivity and aging on the distribution of NK cell subsets with a focus on the expression of cytotoxicity-related molecules and on the expression of CD94/NKG2 heterodimers and CD57 on these NK cell subsets. Our results show that CMV seropositivity in young individuals does not significantly affect peripheral blood NK cell percentage and NK cell subsets defined by the use of CD56 and CD16 markers. In contrast a significant increase in the percentage of NK cells is observed in elderly donors, all of them are CMV seropositive, when compared with young CMV seropositive subjects. A decrease in the percentage of CD56bright NK cells, either fully immature CD16 negative or CD16\u00a0+ and an increase in the CD56\u2212CD16\u00a0+ subset are also found in the elderly.

CD56\u2212CD16\u00a0+ NK cells, which are expanded in the elderly, show a decreased expression of granzymes A and B and an increased expression of CD94/NKG2C and CD57 in CMV seropositive young donors when compared with CMV seronegative young individuals.

Our main findings were twofold. First, the \u03b54-allele was negatively associated with EL in the three cohorts, with the following odds ratio (OR) values (adjusted by sex) having been found: 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33, 0.94), P\u00a0=\u00a00.030 (Spain); 0.41 (95%CI: 0.18, 0.99), P\u00a0=\u00a00.05 (Italy); and 0.35 (95%CI: 0.26, 0.57), P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 (Japan).

Notwithstanding the limitations of case\u2013control designs, our data suggest that the ApoE might be a candidate to influence EL. The \u03b54-allele appears to decrease the likelihood of reaching EL among individuals of different ethnic/geographic origins. An additional, novel finding of our study was that the \u03b52-allele might favor EL, at least in the Italian and Japanese cohorts.",

Total faecal output recorded over a 24\u00a0h period decreased with age due to a reduction in the number of pellets produced and their water content. These changes occurred in the absence of any significant change in food and water intake. There was an increase in the amount of faecal matter stored in the isolated colon with age which caused a proportional increase in colonic length. Analysis of colonic motility using an artificial pellet demonstrated that pellets moved in a stepwise fashion through the colon. There was an age-related increase in pellet transit time due to decreases in the step distance, velocity, and frequency of stepwise movements. These changes were reversed using the neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptor agonist neurokinin A. Addition of the NK2receptor antagonist GR159897 significantly increased transit time in the young animals by decreasing step distance, velocity and frequency, but was without effect in the aged colon. In summary, the ageing C57BL/6J mouse shows an impaired motility phenotype. These effects appear, at least in part, to be due to an attenuation of tachykinin signalling via NK2 receptors.",

Compared with the young group, the maximum grip force of the hands of the elderly group was significantly lower by 77.5% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 71.1% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the dominant and non-dominant hands, respectively. The elderly adults also displayed a significantly longer alternating time control in the dominant to non-dominant and non-dominant to dominant hands at the 20% MVC target force level (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Aging reduces the maximum hand grip force output and the performance of bimanual coordination control of two hands, which may lead to difficulty with the execution of daily activities requiring both hands.",

The arterial stiffness and limb blood flow responses to resistance training in young and older women have not been well-studied. The purpose of this study was to examine arterial stiffness and blood flow adaptations to high-intensity resistance exercise training in young and older women. Young (aged 18\u201325) and older (aged 50\u201364) women performed full-body high-intensity resistance exercise three times per week for eight weeks. The following measurements were performed twice prior to training and once following training: carotid to femoral and femoral to tibialis posterior pulse wave velocity (PWV), blood pressure, heart rate, resting forearm blood flow and forearm reactive hyperemia. Data was analyzed by ANOVAs with alpha set at 0.05. Correlations were also examined between changes in arterial stiffness and baseline arterial stiffness values. Older subjects had higher carotid\u2013femoral PWV than younger subjects. No significant effects were found for femoral-tibialis posterior PWV or for resting forearm blood flow. Changes in carotid\u2013femoral and femoral-tibialis posterior PWV correlated significantly with their respective baseline values. Older subjects increased peak forearm blood flow while young subjects showed no change. Total hyperemia increased significantly in both groups. In conclusion, in both young and older women, eight weeks of high-intensity resistance training appeared to improve microvascular forearm function while not changing carotid\u2013femoral or femoral-tibialis posterior arterial stiffness. However, a large degree of individual variation was found and arterial stiffness adaptations appeared positively related to the initial stiffness values.",

Number of sperm, Sertoli cells and germ cells, and the Sertoli Cell Index decrease in the testis of aged rats (AR) relative to young control rats (YCR). However, those parameters were completely restored in GINST-treated AR (GINST-AR). A proteomic analysis identified 14 proteins that were differentially expressed between vehicle-treated AR (V-AR) and GINST-AR. Out of these, the expression of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) mu5 and phospholipid hydroperoxide (PH) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was significantly up-regulated in GINST-AR compared to V-AR. The activity of GPx and GST, as well as the expression of glutathione, in the testis of GINST-AR was higher than that in V-AR. The levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) increased in AR compared with YCR, but this change was reversed by GINST-AR. These results suggest that the administration of GINST enhances testicular function by elevating GPx and GST activity, thus resulting in increased glutathione, which prevents LPO in the testis.",

The present findings showed that (PhSe)2-supplemented diet enhanced short-term memory, but not long-term memory, of middle-aged rats in the novel object recognition task. The (PhSe)2 supplemented diet associated with caffeine administration improved long-term memory, but did not alter short-term memory, impaired in middle-aged rats. Daily caffeine administration to middle-aged rats had no effect on the memory tasks. Diet supplemented with (PhSe)2 plus caffeine administration increased the number of crossings and rearings reduced in middle-aged rats. Caffeine administration plus (PhSe)2 diets were effective in increasing the number of rearings and crossings, respectively, in middle-aged rats, [3H] glutamate uptake was reduced in hippocampal slices of rats from (PhSe)2 and caffeine plus (PhSe)2 groups. In addition, animals supplemented with (PhSe)2 showed an increase in the pCREB/CREB ratio whereas pAkt/Akt ratio was not modified. These results suggest that the effects of (PhSe)2 on the short-term memory may be related to its ability to decrease the uptake of glutamate, influencing the increase of CREB phosphorylation.

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia is currently best described as an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function. However, no consensus exists as to how to best quantify muscle function in older adults. The muscle quality index (MQI) was recently recommended as an ideal evidence-based assessment of functional status in older adults. Nevertheless, the usefulness of MQI to assess physical function is limited by whether it is reflective of muscle qualitative changes to an intervention. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether MQI changes in response to resistance exercise training and detraining and how such changes correspond to other recommended measures of physical function proposed by suggested definitions of sarcopenia.Twenty-five older adults (70.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0y; BMI\u00a0=\u00a028.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4\u00a0kg\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0m\u2212\u00a02) completed a 6-week resistance training program in a wait-list controlled, cross-over design. MQI was determined as power output from timed sit to stand (STS), body mass, and leg length. Gait speed, hand grip strength, get-up-and-go and lean body mass (LBM) were evaluated before and after exercise training and detraining. MQI and functional changes to training and detraining were evaluated with repeated measures ANOVA and clinical interpretations of magnitude based inferences.Short term resistance training significantly and clinically improved MQI (203.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a064.31 to 244.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a082.92\u00a0W), gait time (1.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36 to 1.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27\u00a0s) and sit to stand performance (13.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.51 to 11.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.58\u00a0s).

Slow and moderate dynamic muscle strength were assessed using isokinetic dynamometry (60 and 180\u00b0\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01, respectively) along with isometric muscle strength and rapid muscle force capacity examined as contractile rate of force development (RFD), Impulse, and relative RFD (rRFD) during the initial phase of contraction (100\u00a0ms time interval relative to onset of contraction). Prior to disuse, marked age-related differences (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were observed in isometric and dynamic muscle strength (~\u00a035%) as well as in RFD and Impulse (~\u00a039%). Following disuse, young and old individuals experienced comparable decrements (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in isometric strength (~\u00a09%), slow dynamic strength (~\u00a013%), and RFD and Impulse (~\u00a019%), whereas old individuals only experienced decrements (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in moderate dynamic strength (12%) and rRFD (~\u00a017%). Following recovery, all measures of mechanical muscle function were restored in young individuals compared to pre-disuse values, while isometric, slow and moderate dynamic muscle strength remained suppressed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in old individuals (~\u00a08%) along with a tendency to suppressed RFD100\u00a0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.068). In conclusion, 4\u00a0days of lower limb disuse led to marked decrements in knee extensor mechanical muscle function in both young and old individuals, yet with greater decrements observed in moderate dynamic strength and rapid muscle force capacity in old individuals. While 7\u00a0days of recovery \u2013 including free ambulation, one test session and a single session of strength training \u2013 was sufficient to restore mechanical muscle function in young individuals, old individuals appeared to have an impaired ability to fully recover as evidenced by suppressed values of isometric and dynamic muscle strength and rapid muscle force capacity.",

We investigated whether long-term administration of atorvastatin affects endothelial dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms. Aortas from young (2\u00a0months), middle-aged (12\u00a0months), and old (20\u00a0months) control rats that had received a routine diet and from old rats (20\u00a0months) that had received a diet mixed with atorvastatin (5\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 8\u00a0months were investigated. Senescent phenotype, vascular reactivity, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), total NO, calcium-dependent and -independent NOS activity, and eNOS, iNOS, and sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) expression at the transcriptional and translational levels were assessed in rat aortas. Comparisons between young, middle, and old control rats showed that the senescent phenotype was enhanced in intima and media (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and that MDA, calcium-independent NOS activity, and iNOS increased with age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), whereas endothelium-dependent relaxation, SOD, NO, calcium-dependent NOS activity, eNOS, the eNOS/iNOS ratio, and SIRT1 declined with age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

     "abstract": "Preservation of functional ability is a well-recognized marker of longevity. At a molecular level, a major determinant of the physiological decline occurring with aging is the imbalance between production and accumulation of oxidative damage to macromolecules, together with a decreased efficiency of stress response to avoid or repair such damage. In this paper we investigated the association of 38 genes (311 SNPs) belonging to the pro\u2013antioxidant pathways with physical and cognitive performances, by analyzing single SNP and gene-based associations with Hand Grip strength (HG), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Walking Speed (WS), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Composite Cognitive Score (CCS) in a Cohort of 1089 Danish nonagenarians. Moreover, for each gene analyzed in the pro\u2013antioxidant pathway, we tested the influence on longitudinal survival.In the whole sample, nominal associations were found for TXNRD1 variability with ADL and WS, NDUFS1 and UCP3 with HG and WS, GCLC and UCP2 with WS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Stronger associations although not holding the multiple comparison correction, were observed between MMSE and NDUFV1, MT1A and GSTP1 variability (p\u00a0<\u00a00.009). Moreover, we found that association between genetic variability in the pro\u2013antioxidant pathway and functional status at old age is influenced by sex. In particular, most significant associations were observed in nonagenarian females, between HG scores and GLRX and UCP3 variability, between ADL levels and TXNRD1, MMSE and MT1A genetic variability. In males, a borderline statistically significant association with ADL level was found for UQCRFS1 gene.Nominally significant associations in relation to survival were found in the female sample only with SOD2, NDUFS1, UCP3 and TXNRD1 variability, the latter two confirming previous observations reported in the same cohort. Overall, our work supports the evidence that genes belonging to the pro\u2013anti-oxidant pathway are able to modulate physical and cognitive performance after the ninth decade of life, finally influencing extreme survival.",

     "abstract": "Knee pain is commonly seen in orthopedic and rehabilitation outpatient clinical settings, and in the aging population. Bursitis of the knee joint, especially when the volume of the synovial fluid is large enough, can compress and distend the nearby soft tissues, causing pain in the knee joint. Out of all the bursae surrounding the knee joint, supra-patellar bursitis is most often associated with knee pain. Treatment strategies in managing supra-patellar bursitis include the aspiration of joint synovial fluid and then followed by steroid injection into the bursa. When supra-patellar bursitis is caused by degenerative disorders, the concept of viscosupplementation treatment may be effective by injecting hyaluronic acid into the bursa. However, the rheology or the changes in the concentrations of proteins (biomarkers) that are related to the development of bursitis in the synovial fluid is virtually unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the concentration changes in the synovial fluid total protein amount and individual proteins associated with supra-patellar bursitis using the Bradford protein assay and western immunoglobulin methods. A total of 20 patients were divided into two groups with 10 patients in each group. One group received the high molecular weight hyaluronic acid product of Synvisc Hylan G-F 20 and the other group received the low molecular weight hyaluronic acid product of Hya-Joint Synovial Fluid Supplement once per week injection into the bursa for a total of 3\u00a0weeks. Significant decreases in the synovial fluid total protein concentrations were observed after the second dosage of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid injections. Apolipoprotein A-I, interleukin 1 beta, alpha 1 antitrypsin, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 proteins revealed a trend of decreasing western immunoblotting band densities after hyaluronic acid injections. The decreases in apolipoprotein A-I and interleukin 1 beta protein band densities were significant in the high molecular weight hyaluronic acid injection group. Transthyretin, complement 5, and matrilin 3 proteins revealed a trend of increasing western immunoblotting band densities after hyaluronic acid injections. Transthyretin revealed significant increases in protein band densities in both the high and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid injection groups. This study may provide the rationale for targeting several biomarkers associated with lipid transport, inflammation, and anti-aging as possible disease modifying therapies for the treatment of supra-patellar bursitis and even degenerative joint disorders.",

The effect of age on the efficacy of MSC transplantation on regeneration, however, has not been clearly demonstrated due to variable methods of isolation of MSCs and variations in stem cell populations. In this study, dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) subsets were isolated from young and aged dog teeth based on their migratory response to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (MDPSCs). In order to study the age-associated changes, their biological properties and stability were compared and the regenerative potential was examined in a pulpectomized tooth model in aged dogs. MDPSCs from aged dogs were efficiently enriched in stem cells, expressing trophic factors with high proliferation, migration and anti-apoptotic effects as in MDPSCs from young dogs. However, pulp regeneration was retarded 120\u00a0days after autologous transplantation of aged MDPSCs. We further demonstrated that isolated periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) from aged dogs, representative of migrating stem cells from outside of the tooth compartment to regenerate pulp tissue, had lower proliferation, migration and anti-apoptotic abilities. These results therefore provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the age-dependent decline in pulp regeneration, which are attributed to a decrease in the regenerative potential of resident stem cells.",

     "abstract": "The TOR kinase pathway is central in modulating aging in a variety of animal models. The target of rapamycin (TOR) integrates a complex network of signals from growth conditions, nutrient availability, energy status, and physiological stresses and matches an organism's growth rate to the resource environment. Important remaining problems are the identification of the pathways that interact with TOR and their characterization as additive or synergistic. One of the most versatile stress sensors in metazoans is the Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. JNK is an evolutionarily conserved stress-activated protein kinase that is induced by a range of stressors, including UV irradiation, reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, heat, and bacterial antigens. JNK is thought to interact with the TOR pathway, but its effects on TOR are poorly understood. We used the rotifer Brachionus manjavacas as a model animal to probe the regulation of TOR and JNK pathways and explore their interaction. The effect of various chemical inhibitors was examined in life table and stressor challenge experiments. A survey of 12 inhibitors revealed two, rapamycin and JNK inhibitor, that significantly extended lifespan of B. manjavacas. At 1\u00a0\u03bcM concentration, exposure to rapamycin or JNK inhibitor extended mean rotifer lifespan by 35% and maximum lifespan by 37%. Exposure to both rapamycin and JNK inhibitor simultaneously extended mean rotifer lifespan by 65% more than either alone. Exposure to a combination of rapamycin and JNK inhibitors conveyed greater protection to starvation, UV and osmotic stress than either inhibitor alone. RNAi knockdown of TOR and JNK gene expression was investigated for its ability to extend rotifer lifespan. RNAi knockdown of the TOR gene resulted in 29% extension of the mean lifespan compared to control and knockdown of the JNK gene resulted in 51% mean lifespan extension. In addition to the lifespan, we quantified mitochondria activity using the fluorescent marker MitoTracker and lysosome activity using LysoTracker. Treatment of rotifers with JNK inhibitor enhanced mitochondria activity nearly 3-fold, whereas rapamycin treatment had no significant effect. Treatment of rotifers with rapamycin or JNK inhibitor reduced lysosome activity in 1, 3 and 8\u00a0day old animals, but treatment with both inhibitors did not produce any additive effect. We conclude that inhibition of TOR and JNK pathways significantly extends the lifespan of B. manjavacas. These pathways interact so that inhibition of both simultaneously acts additively to extend rotifer lifespan more than the inhibition of either alone.",

     "abstract": "Human adult aging is associated with a loss of strength, contractile velocity and hence, power. The principal plantar flexors, consisting of the bi-articular gastrocnemeii and the mono-articular soleus, appear to be affected differently by the aging process. However, the age-related effect of knee joint angle on the torque\u2013angular velocity relationship and power production of this functionally important muscle group is unknown. The purpose was to determine whether flexing the knee, thereby reducing the gastrocnemius contribution to plantar flexion, would exacerbate the age-related decrements in plantar flexion power, or shift the torque\u2013angular velocity relationship differently in older compared with young men. Neuromuscular properties were recorded from 10 young (~\u00a025\u00a0y) and 10 old (~\u00a078\u00a0y) men with the knee extended (170\u00b0) and flexed (90\u00b0), in a randomized order. Participants performed maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVCs), followed by maximal velocity-dependent shortening contractions at pre-set loads, ranging from 15 to 75% MVC. The young men were ~\u00a020\u201325% stronger, ~\u00a012% faster and ~\u00a030% more powerful than the old for both knee angles (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In both age groups, isometric MVC torque was ~\u00a017% greater in the extended than flexed knee position, with no differences in voluntary activation (>\u00a095%). The young men produced 7\u201312% faster angular velocities in the extended knee position for loads \u2264\u00a030% MVC, but no differences at higher loads; whereas there were no detectable differences in angular velocity between knee positions in the old across all relative loads. For both knee angles, young men produced peak power at 43.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.0% MVC, whereas the old men produced peak power at 54.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9% MVC.

     "abstract": "The leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 3 (LRRTM3) has been defined as a positional and functional candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease. Recently, four novel variants (rs16923760, rs1925608, rs1925609 and rs10997477) within LRRTM3 were reported to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians. To evaluate the association of the LRRTM3 polymorphisms with LOAD in Asians, we performed a case\u2013control study of 2287 unrelated subjects (1129 cases and 1158 age- and gender-matched controls) in Han Chinese. The rs10997477 T allele was significantly associated with a decreased risk of LOAD in APOE \u03b54 allele noncarriers (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.750, PC\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Besides, the rs16923760 C allele significantly increased the risk of LOAD in APOE \u03b54 allele carriers (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.837, PC\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The genotype distribution of rs1925609 polymorphism also significantly differed in APOE \u03b54 allele noncarriers (PC\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Moreover, the association was further demonstrated in multivariate logistic regression analysis (rs10997477: Recessive model: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.156, PC\u00a0=\u00a00.004; Additive model: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.731, PC\u00a0<\u00a00.001; rs16923760: Dominant model: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.944, PC\u00a0=\u00a00.024; Additive model: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.885, PC\u00a0<\u00a00.001; Recessive model: OR\u00a0=\u00a03.565, PC\u00a0=\u00a00.010; rs1925609: Recessive model: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.421, PC\u00a0=\u00a00.024). As for rs1925608, we failed to detect any association with LOAD. This study firstly provides the independent evidence that the LRRTM3 polymorphisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of LOAD in a Northern Han Chinese population. However, additional independent replication groups are required to further validate this association.",

     "abstract": "Telomeres \u2013 the protective ends of linear chromosomes \u2013 reveal themselves not only as a good proxy in terms of longevity, but more recently also as a marker of healthy ageing in laboratory rodents. Telomere erosion is prevented by the activation of telomerase, an enzyme suspected to be also vital for tissue regeneration and which experimental activation improves health state in mice. One emerging hypothesis is that telomerase activity accounts for the frequently reported positive links between telomere lengths and individual quality in a wide range of organisms. Still, we lack an experimental approach testing the exact impact of inter-individual differences in telomere length on individual trait variability. In a first step study, we tested the impact of the TA-65, a plant-derived product stimulating the expression and the activity of telomerase, on telomere lengths and flight feather renewal capacity of captive zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata). Telomere length was longer in TA-65 treated finches while their feather grew faster than in controls. Our data support the idea that long telomeres could reflect high telomerase activity, and in so doing be a good predictor of greater telomerase-dependent tissue regeneration, which may ultimately explain variation in organism quality and longevity.",

HC exacerbated the decline in the brain levels of GSH and the increase in MPO, proinflammatory markers and hippocampal lesions in response to GCI/R. HC rats receiving rosiglitazone, PPAR-\u03b3 agonist, demonstrated preservation of cell viability of CA1 hippocampal region and attenuation of brain edema. They also showed elevated levels of GSH and low levels of the other parameters similar to non-HC rats subjected to GCI/R. In vitro, rosiglitazone dose-dependently inhibited ROS generation by neutrophils. The results suggest exacerbation of brain lesions by HC in response to GCI/R. The neuroprotective therapeutic potentials of rosiglitazone are comparable to non-HC animals. Mechanisms of protection are possibly due to anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory effects and scavenging properties of rosiglitazone. These results add to the beneficial therapeutic effects of rosiglitazone and its significance for age-associated diseases including hypercholesterolemia.",

However, there is a lack of information concerning SIRT1 expression in the cochlea and auditory cortex of C57BL/6 mice, a mouse model of age-related hearing loss. Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we show that SIRT1 is abundantly expressed in the inner hair cells, strial marginal cells, strial intermediate cells, type I and type IV fibrocytes of the spiral ligament and spiral ganglion neurons. In addition, moderate SIRT1 is also detected in the outer hair cells and neurons of the auditory cortex. Associated with elevated hearing thresholds and hair cells loss during aging, there is also a significant reduction of SIRT1 expression in the cochlea and auditory cortex. The expression pattern of SIRT1 in the peripheral and central auditory system suggests that SIRT1 may play an important role in auditory function and therefore may serve as a protective molecule against age-related hearing loss.",

Eligible observational studies measured telomeres for both females and males of any age, had a minimum sample size of 100 and included participants not part of a diseased group. We calculated summary estimates using random-effects meta-analyses. Heterogeneity between studies was investigated using sub-group analysis and meta-regression.Meta-analyses from 36 cohorts (36,230 participants) showed that on average females had longer telomeres than males (standardised difference in telomere length between females and males 0.090, 95% CI 0.015, 0.166; age-adjusted). There was little evidence that these associations varied by age group (p\u00a0=\u00a01.00) or cell type (p\u00a0=\u00a00.29). However, the size of this difference did vary by measurement methods, with only Southern blot but neither real-time PCR nor Flow-FISH showing a significant difference. This difference was not associated with random measurement error.Telomere length is longer in females than males, although this difference was not universally found in studies that did not use Southern blot methods.

To examine the intraspecific evolutionary conservation of lifespan extension by CR, we tested the effects of chronic caloric restriction (CCR) at multiple food levels and of intermittent fasting (IF) in twelve isolates from the Brachionus plicatilis species complex of monogonont rotifers. While CCR generally increased or did not change lifespan and total fecundity, IF caused increased, unchanged, or decreased lifespan, depending upon the isolate, and decreased total fecundity in all but one isolate. Lifespan under ad libitum (AL) feeding varied among isolates and predicted the lifespan response to CR: longer-lived isolates under AL were less likely to have a significant increase in lifespan under CCR and were more likely to have a significantly shortened lifespan under IF. Lifespan under AL conditions and the response to CR were not correlated with hydroperiodicity of native habitat or with time in culture. Lack of trade-off between lifespan and fecundity under CCR, and differences in lifespan and fecundity under CCR and IF, even when average food intake was similar, suggest that longevity changes are not always directly determined by energy intake and that CCR and IF regimens extend lifespan through diverse genetic mechanisms.",

Half of the hamsters had access to running wheels during their rapid growth phase (from 1 to 3\u00a0months of age). The hamsters were sacrificed at the ages of 1, 3, 12, and 15\u00a0months. The diaphysis of the mineralized humerus was analyzed with microCT and subjected to three-point-bending mechanical testing. The trabecular bone in the tibial metaphysis was also analyzed with microCT. The collagen matrix of the humerus bone was studied by tensile testing after decalcification.The weight of the hamsters as well as the length of the bone and the volumetric bone mineral density (BMDvol) of the humerus was higher in the running group at the early age (3\u00a0months). Moreover, the mineralized bone showed improved mechanical properties in humerus and had greater trabecular thickness in the subchondral bone of tibia in the runners. However, by the age of 12 and 15\u00a0months, these differences were equalized with the sedentary group. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of decalcified humerus were higher in the runners at early stage, indicating a stronger collagen network. In tibial metaphysis, trabecular thickness was significantly higher for the runners in the old age groups (12 and 15\u00a0months).Our study demonstrates that physical exercise during growth improves either directly or indirectly through weight gain bone properties of the hamsters.

Age negatively affected oxidative status in the animals, which also increased the levels of total cholesterol, protein, and globulins and increased the thickness of the muscle layer. Aging also reduced the number and hypertrophied glial cell bodies, HuC/D neurons, and nNOS-negative and -positive neurons. An improvement was observed in oxidative status and the levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides with food restriction, which also provided neuroprotection of the intrinsic innervation. However, food restriction accentuated the loss of enteric glia and caused hypertrophy in the muscle layer at 23\u00a0months. Food restriction improved oxidative and nutritional status in rats and protected HuC/D neurons and nNOS-negative and -positive neurons against neuronal loss. Nevertheless, food restriction caused morphoquantitative changes in glial cell populations, with possible interference with colonic neuromuscular control.",

In this study, we investigated whether AMPK-mediated Cx43 expression and premature senescence in diabetic nephropathy are associated with mTOR activation. From in vivo and in vitro studies, we found decreased expression of Cx43 and p-AMPK but increased expression of p21 both in the glomeruli of diabetic nephropathy and in primary GMCs cultured in high glucose. Activating AMPK or inhibiting mTOR prevented the downregulation of Cx43 and reversed GMC senescence. Dominant-negative AMPK expression both reduced Cx43 expression and induced GMC senescence. Furthermore, AMPK regulated Cx43 expression and GMC senescence mainly through the inhibition of mTOR, although other pathways cannot be ruled out. This study demonstrated that AMPK signaling pathways play an important role in the regulation of the Cx43 expression that accompanies GMC senescence under high-glucose conditions.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that coffee, one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, has potential pharmacological benefits such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. Since these effects may improve sarcopenia and the functions of satellite cells, we examined the effects of coffee on the skeletal muscles in an animal model using aged mice. In vivo, coffee treatment attenuated the decrease in the muscle weight and grip strength, increased the regenerating capacity of injured muscles, and decreased the serum pro-inflammatory mediator levels compared to controls. In vitro, using satellite cells isolated from aged mice, coffee treatment increased the cell proliferation rate, augmented the cell cycle, and increased the activation level of Akt intra-cellular signaling pathway compared to controls.

     "abstract": "Stair descent is a frequent daily activity that poses great risks for injury due to falling. Very little is understood about the attentional demands of stair descent and their changes with aging. The present study compared combined locomotor and cognitive functioning during different phases of stair descent between healthy young and older individuals.Sixteen young and sixteen healthy older subjects walked down a 5-step staircase, performing a simultaneous visual Stroop task (i.e., a dual task) during the approach, transition or steady-state descent phases in some trials. Three dimensional kinematics of trunk and foot motion were recorded along with the accuracy and dual task costs (DTCs) for responses to the Stroop stimuli.Dual tasking influenced both gait and cognitive performance for all subjects, and older adults generally walked slower with higher foot clearances and had greater DTCs. Specific age differences were found at stair transition where older adults showed more attentional effects.Healthy, active older adults showed changes to attention and planning due to normal aging specifically associated with a crucial point of fall risk during stair descent.",

This effect, which depends on the heat shock factor, decreases the log mortality rate weeks after the stress has ceased. To identify candidate genes that mediate this lifespan-prolonging effect late in life, we treated flies with mild heat stress (34\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h) 3 times early in life and compared the transcriptomic response in these flies versus non-heat-treated controls 10\u201351\u00a0days after the last heat treatment. We found significant transcriptomic changes in the heat-treated flies. Several hsp70 probe sets were up-regulated 1.7\u20132-fold in the mildly stressed flies weeks after the last heat treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). This result was unexpected as the major Drosophila heat shock protein, Hsp70, is reported to return to normal levels of expression shortly after heat stress. We conclude that the heat shock response, and Hsp70 in particular, may be central to the heat-induced increase in the average lifespan in flies that are exposed to mild heat stress early in life.",

We evaluated the effect of the aging process on selected parameters determining the NO level in rat liver subjected to IR.The animals were divided into the C-2 and the IR-2 group of young rats (2\u20134\u00a0months old) and the C-12 and the IR-12 group of older rats (12\u201314\u00a0months old). Livers belonging to the IR-2 and the IR-12 group were subjected to partial ischemia (60\u00a0min) and reperfusion (4\u00a0h). Blood samples were obtained after surgeries to estimate the activity of aminotransferases, as well as just before ischemia and during reperfusion (15, 120, and 240\u00a0min) to estimate concentration of arginine (Arg) and its derivatives: asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA, SDMA). After IR, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity and protein concentration of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were measured in liver homogenates.In the IR-2 group ADMA level increased the most between 15 and 120\u00a0min of reperfusion and was the highest of all the groups (0.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcmol/l). In the IR-12 group ADMA level decreased significantly and was lower compared to all the other groups at 15\u00a0min (0.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcmol/l) and to IR-2 at 120 (0.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u03bcmol/l) and 240\u00a0min (0.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u03bcmol/l) of reperfusion.

     "abstract": "Many nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals have been shown to promote healthspan and lifespan. However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of prolongevity interventions and the time points at which interventions should be implemented to achieve beneficial effects are not well characterized. We have previously shown that a cranberry-containing nutraceutical can promote lifespan in worms and flies and delay age-related functional decline of pancreatic cells in rats. Here we investigated the mechanism underlying lifespan extension induced by cranberry and the effects of short-term or life stage-specific interventions with cranberry on lifespan in Drosophila. We found that lifespan extension induced by cranberry was associated with reduced phosphorylation of ERK, a component of oxidative stress response MAPK signaling, and slightly increased phosphorylation of AKT, a component of insulin-like signaling. Lifespan extension was also associated with a reduced level of 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts, a biomarker of lipid oxidation. Moreover, lifespan extension induced by cranberry was partially suppressed by knockdown of SOD2, a major mitochondrial superoxide scavenger. Furthermore, cranberry supplementation was administered in three life stages of adult flies, health span (3\u201330\u00a0days), transition span (31\u201360\u00a0days) and senescence span (61\u00a0days to the end when all flies died). Cranberry supplementation during any of these life stages extended the remaining lifespan relative to the non-supplemented and life stage-matched controls. These findings suggest that cranberry supplementation is sufficient to promote longevity when implemented during any life stage, likely through reducing oxidative damage.",

     "abstract": "Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) are novel markers of oxidation-mediated protein damage, and accumulation of AOPPs is involved in many pathophysiological conditions. Our previous studies demonstrated that the serum level of AOPPs negatively correlated with the age-related change in bone mineral density (BMD) in rats and that AOPPs inhibited rat osteoblast-like cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro. However, whether AOPPs are involved in senile osteoporosis is still largely unknown. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that accumulation of AOPPs might accelerate bone deterioration in aged rats. Seventy 18-month-old male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomized to intravenous injection of vehicle, native rat serum albumin (RSA), AOPPs-modified RSA (AOPPs-RSA) with or without oral administration of apocynin (a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor), or apocynin alone. After treatment for 8\u00a0weeks or 16\u00a0weeks, seven rats in each group were sacrificed. Bone and blood samples were harvested for BMD measurement, micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT) imaging, and biochemical analysis of circulating bone biomarkers. Compared to RSA- or vehicle-treated rats, AOPPs-RSA-treated animals displayed significantly decreased total vertebral BMD and deteriorated microstructure in both the tibias and the lumbar vertebral bodies, which were associated with down-regulated plasma bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentration and up-regulated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b concentration. These AOPPs-induced perturbations in aged rats could be prevented by the oral administration of apocynin. However, no significant differences in BMD were detected in the femurs or the biomechanical parameters tested between the different treatment groups. These data suggest that accumulation of AOPPs accelerates bone deterioration in aged rats, likely via the activation of NADPH oxidase. This study provides new information toward understanding the pathogenic basis of senile osteoporosis and may provide targets for intervention.",

We tested whether age-dependent shifts in ischemia\u2013reperfusion (I\u2013R) tolerance in murine and human myocardium are associated with reduced efficacies and coupling of membrane, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial survival-signaling. Hormesis (exemplified in ischemic preconditioning; IPC) and expression of proteins influencing signaling/stress-resistance were also assessed in mice. Mouse hearts (18 vs. 2\u20134\u00a0mo) and human atrial tissue (75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 vs. 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0yrs) exhibited profound age-dependent reductions in I\u2013R tolerance. In mice aging negated cardioprotection via IPC, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) agonism (opioid, A1 and A3 adenosine receptors) and distal protein kinase c (PKC) activation (4\u00a0nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PMA). In contrast, p38-mitogen activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) activation (1\u00a0\u03bcM anisomycin), mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel (mKATP) opening (50\u00a0\u03bcM diazoxide) and permeability transition pore (mPTP) inhibition (0.2\u00a0\u03bcM cyclosporin A) retained protective efficacies in older hearts (though failed to eliminate I\u2013R tolerance differences). A similar pattern of change in protective efficacies was observed in human tissue. Murine hearts exhibited molecular changes consistent with altered membrane control (reduced caveolin-3, cholesterol and caveolae), kinase signaling (reduced p70 ribosomal s6 kinase; p70s6K) and stress-resistance (increased G-protein receptor kinase 2, GRK2; glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2, GSK3\u03b2; and cytosolic cytochrome c). In summary, myocardial I\u2013R tolerance declines with age in association with dysfunctional hormesis and transduction of survival signals from GPCRs/PKC to mitochondrial effectors.

In this study we investigated the potential that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg), an abundant catechin in green tea, would reduce signaling for apoptosis and promote skeletal muscle recovery in the fast plantaris muscle and the slow soleus muscle after hindlimb suspension (HLS) in senescent animals. Fischer 344\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Brown Norway inbred rats (age 34\u00a0months) received either EGCg (50\u00a0mg/kg body weight), or water daily by gavage. One group of animals received HLS for 14\u00a0days and a second group of rats received 14\u00a0days of HLS, then the HLS was removed and they recovered from this forced disuse for 2\u00a0weeks. Animals that received EGCg over the HLS followed by 14\u00a0days of recovery, had a 14% greater plantaris muscle weight (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as compared to the animals treated with the vehicle over this same period. Plantaris fiber area was greater after recovery in EGCg (2715.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0113.8\u00a0\u03bcm2) vs. vehicle treated animals (1953.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041.9\u00a0\u03bcm2). In addition, activation of myogenic progenitor cells was improved with EGCg over vehicle treatment (7.5% vs. 6.2%) in the recovery animals.

While EGCg did not prevent unloading-induced atrophy, it improved muscle recovery after the atrophic stimulus in fast plantaris muscles.

     "abstract": "Panax ginseng has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Among its various benefits is a pluripotent targeting of the various events involved in neuronal cell death. This includes anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. Indeed, ginseng extract and its individual ginsenosides have been demonstrated to influence a number of biochemical markers implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. We have reported previously that administration of the ginseng extract, G115, afforded robust neuroprotection in two rodent models of PD. However, these traditional rodent models are acute in nature and do accurately recapitulate the progressive nature of the disease. Chronic exposure to the dietary phytosterol glucoside, \u03b2-sitosterol \u03b2-d-glucoside (BSSG) triggers the progressive development of neurological deficits, with behavioral and cellular features that closely approximate those observed in PD patients. Clinical signs and histopathology continue to develop for several months following cessation of exposure to the neurotoxic insult. Here, we utilized this model to further characterize the neuroprotective effects of the ginseng extract, G115. Oral administration of this extract significantly reduced dopaminergic cell loss, microgliosis, and accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. Further, G115 administration fully prevented the development of locomotor deficits, in the form of reduced locomotor activity and coordination. These results suggest that ginseng extract may be a potential neuroprotective therapy for the treatment of PD.",

Zebrafish turning frequency, which is an indicator of routine activity, decreased with age but showed no change with exercise.

Western blotting revealed age related increases in Grp78, serinepalmitoyltransferase and neutral sphingomyelinase, suggesting that age increased the stress response and ceramide metabolism in the SR. In contrast Parkin, a protein associated with autophagic signaling, was reduced in the aged SR. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that age-related impairments of the SR, possibly due to impaired autophagy and/or altered membrane metabolism, contribute to age-related muscle weakness, independent of changes in muscle mass.",

R (\u03a9) and Xc (\u03a9) values were standardized for stature (H, m) to obtain the classic bioelectrical values. Specific values (resistivity [Rsp] and reactivity [Xcsp], \u03a9\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0cm) were obtained by multiplying R and Xc by a correction factor (A/L) that includes an estimate of the cross-sectional area of the body (A\u00a0=\u00a00.45 arm area\u00a0+\u00a00.10 waist area\u00a0+\u00a00.45 calf area), where L\u00a0=\u00a01.1\u00a0H.Descriptive statistics were: Rsp (391.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a057.9), Xcsp (42.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.9), Zsp (394.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058.2), phase angle (6.2\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2) in men; Rsp (462.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a080.1), Xcsp (47.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.2), Zsp (464.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a080.5), phase angle (5.9\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0) in women. The Xcsp and phase angle values showed a significant age-related decrease in both sexes, but especially in men, possibly relating to a gradual loss of muscle mass. Women's Rsp and Zsp values tended to drop, attributable to their declining proportion of fat mass. A declining sexual dimorphism was also apparent.Specific tolerance ellipses can be used for reference purposes for the Italian population when assessing body composition in gerontological practice and for epidemiological purposes.",

Quite unexpectedly, mtDNA from young bees showed more damage than mtDNA from older bees, but neither mtDNA integrity, nor mtDNA copy number nor mitochondrial gene expression correlated with learning performance. Although not statistically significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07) the level of L-rRNA increased with age in good learners whereas it decreased in poor learners.

Restoring Dystrophin expression in the heart by gene transfer is a promising avenue to explore as a therapy. Truncated Dystrophin gene constructs have been engineered and shown to alleviate dystrophic skeletal muscle disease, but their potential in preventing the development of cardiomyopathy is not fully understood. In the present study, we found that either the mechanical or the signaling functions of Dystrophin were able to reduce the dilated heart phenotype of Dystrophin mutants in a Drosophila model. Our data suggest that Dystrophin retains some function in fly cardiomyocytes in the absence of a predicted mechanical link to the cytoskeleton. Interestingly, cardiac-specific manipulation of nitric oxide synthase expression also modulates cardiac function, which can in part be reversed by loss of Dystrophin function, further implying a signaling role of Dystrophin in the heart. These findings suggest that the signaling functions of Dystrophin protein are able to ameliorate the dilated cardiomyopathy, and thus might help to improve heart muscle function in micro-Dystrophin-based gene therapy approaches.",

     "abstract": "Diabetic older adults are at a higher risk of muscle strength (MS) decline than their non-diabetic counterparts. Adequate protein and energy intakes and physical activity (PA) may preserve MS during aging. However, the role of diet quality (DQ) in MS maintenance is still unknown. This study aimed to determine the association between DQ \u2013 alone or combined with PA \u2013 and changes in MS over 3\u00a0years in diabetic participants aged 67 to 84\u00a0years at recruitment in a secondary analysis of the longitudinal observational NuAge study. Changes in handgrip, knee extensor and elbow flexor strengths were calculated as the difference between recruitment (T1) and after 3\u00a0years (T4) in 156 diabetic older adults. Baseline DQ was calculated from 3 non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls collected at T1 using the validated Canadian Healthy Eating Index (C-HEI). Change in PA was calculated from Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) as PASE T4\u00a0\u2212\u00a0PASE T1. Four combinations of variables were created: C-HEI\u00a0<\u00a070 with PASE change either < or > median and C-HEI\u00a0\u2265\u00a070 with PASE change either < or > median. The association between these four categories and MS maintenance was evaluated using General Linear Modeling (GLM). Analyses were stratified by sex and controlled for covariates. Baseline DQ alone was not associated with MS maintenance. Baseline DQ combined with PASE change showed associations with crude and baseline adjusted handgrip strength (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and crude and baseline adjusted elbow flexor change (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) in males only; no significant results were found for knee extensor strength in either males or females. While findings for females were inconclusive, results demonstrate that better adherence to dietary guidelines combined with a more active lifestyle may prevent MS decline among diabetic older males. Additional research is needed on a larger sample since generalization of these results is limited by the small sample size.",

One hundred thirty-three healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. MAIT cells, their subset, and cytokine levels were measured by flow cytometry. Circulating MAIT cell levels were found to vary widely (0.19% to 21.7%) in the study subjects and to be significantly lower in elderly subjects (age, 61\u201392\u00a0years) than in young subjects (age, 21\u201340\u00a0years) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005). No significant difference was found in the circulating MAIT cell levels between male and female subjects. A linear regression analysis revealed that circulating MAIT cell levels declined annually by 3.2% among men and 1.8% among women, respectively. Notably, the proportion of CD4\u00a0+ MAIT cells increased with age, whereas that of CD8\u00a0+ MAIT cells decreased with age. In addition, the production of interleukin (IL)-4 by MAIT cells was found to be significantly increased in elderly subjects and the ratio of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3/IL-4 was lower as compared with young subjects, showing a Th1 to Th2 shift in cytokine profile in elderly subjects.

     "abstract": "Aging has been reported to be associated with changes in immune function. Although frequent infection and the development of malignancy suggest the decline of immune function with aging, changes toward proinflammatory conditions also develop at the same time. Th17 cells are well known CD4+ T cell subpopulation closely linked to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. In this study, changes in the Th17 population were investigated to elucidate a possible mechanism for this response with aging.Splenocytes were isolated from 2-month-old (young) and 20-month-old (aged) mice. CD4+CD44+ memory T cells and CD4+CD62L+ na\u00efve T cells were isolated and sorted using magnetic beads and flow cytometry. The frequency of IL-17-producing cells was measured using flow cytometry. The expression of IL-17 and Th17-related factors at the mRNA level was measured with RT-PCR. IL-17 and Il-1\u03b2 expression in spleen tissues was additionally assessed using confocal microscopy.The proportion of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells was higher in the splenocytes among the old mice than those of the young mice. When splenocytes were cultured in Th17 polarizing conditions, the proportion of IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells was higher in aged mice as well. This was consistently observed when na\u00efve and memory cells were isolated and differentiated into Th17 respectively. In addition, the expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t (ROR\u03b3t) and other Th17-related factors (AhR, CCR6, and CCL20) increased in the splenocytes of aged mice compared to the young mice. The expression of IL-1\u03b2, showing to promote Th17 differentiation, was higher in the aged mice. Likewise, CD4+ T cell expression of IL-1R was higher in the aged mice, suggesting that the CD4+ T cells of the aged mice are readily prepared to differentiate into Th17 cells in response to IL-1\u03b2. Confocal microscopy showed that cells positive for IL-1R or IL-1\u03b2 were more frequent in the spleens of the aged mice. When an anti-IL-2 antibody was applied, the proportion of IL-17-producing cells increased more prominently in the young mice. We observed that IL-2 production and IL-2R expression were reduced in the aged mice, respectively, explaining the blunted response to the anti-IL-2 antibody treatment and the consequent minimal change in the Th17 population.We demonstrated that the proportion of Th17 cells increased in the aged mice both in na\u00efve and memory cell populations. Elevation of IL-1R and IL-1\u03b2 expression and the reduction in IL-2 and IL-2R expression in aged mice seemed to promote Th17 differentiation. Our results suggest that enhanced Th17 differentiation in aging may have a pathogenic role in the development of Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases.",

     "abstract": "Pineal melatonin is important not only for synchronization of biological rhythms, but also in the ageing process as a potential drug to relieve oxidative damage. During ageing, the nocturnal melatonin production decreases resulting in an increased incidence of disorders. Present in vivo experiments were performed to study the effects of exogenous melatonin chronically administered to old rats on the pineal biosynthesis of melatonin and the precursor serotonin (5-HT) mediated by tryptophan hydroxylase type 1 (TPH-1). Accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) after decarboxylase inhibition was used as a measure of the TPH-1 activity. 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA were also quantified by HPLC-ED. As expected, ageing resulted in worsening of different neurochemical parameters. However, chronic intake of melatonin (1\u00a0mg/kg/day, diluted in drinking water, 4\u00a0weeks) increased TPH-1 activity and significantly improved the age-induced deficits in nocturnal melatonin content in the pineal gland. Results suggest that melatonin intake (or melatonin rich foods) may contribute to recover the pineal function preventing the nocturnal descent of 5-HT and melatonin biosynthesis that normally occur in pineal gland as a consequence of ageing.",

For attentional assessment we used a version of the Attention Network Test (the ANTI-V) that provided not only a score of the orienting, the executive, and the alerting networks and their interactions, but also an independent measure of vigilance (tonic alerting). The results showed that all subtypes of MCI patients exhibited a selective impairment in the tonic component of alerting, as indexed by a decrease in the d\u2032 sensitivity index, and their performance in executive network increased up to the HC group level when phasic alerting was provided by a warning tone.

     "abstract": "Aging is associated with multiple changes in the proliferative and functional abilities of the immune system which are not related to any pathology but consequences in immunosenescence and inflammaging.T helper (TH) 17 cells have been implicated in the development of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases in humans. Additionally, a reciprocal relationship between these pro-inflammatory TH17 and the anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been described. Recent studies reported an increase of TH17 cells in aged humans and aged mice, but the role of TH17 cells and their relation to Tregs is poorly understood in human aging. This study investigated the proportion of TH17 (CD4\u00a0+ IL23 receptor(R)+) cells and Tregs (CD4\u00a0+ Foxp3\u00a0+) as well as Interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-10 production in four different age groups from human healthy donors. The data revealed a continual increase of basal CD4\u00a0+ IL23R\u00a0+ cell amounts in the different age groups. By analyzing the balance of both T-cell subsets it was observed that, on a basal resting level, TH17 cells were significantly increased in older individuals whereas Tregs were reduced. However, the TH17/Treg ratio decreased age-dependently after stimulation and was accompanied by elevated Foxp3 mRNA and IL-10 protein expressions.In conclusion, changes of the TH17/Treg ratios in combination with altered cytokine expression during aging may contribute to an imbalance between the pro-inflammatory and the anti-inflammatory immune response. This indicates a higher susceptibility to develop inflammatory diseases with increasing age.",

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are supposed to be major factors leading to age-related IR. Genipin, an extract from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis fruit, has been reported to stimulate insulin secretion in pancreatic islet cells by regulating mitochondrial function. In this study, we first investigated the effects of genipin on insulin sensitivity and the potential mitochondrial mechanisms in the liver of aging rats. The rats were randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal injections of either 25\u00a0mg/kg genipin or vehicle once daily for 12\u00a0days. The aging rats showed hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance as examined by the decreased glucose decay constant rate during insulin tolerance test (kITT). The hepatic tissues showed steatosis and reduced glycogen content. Hepatic malondialdehyde level and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were higher, and levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP were lower as compared with the normal control rats. Administration of genipin ameliorated systemic and hepatic insulin resistance, alleviated hyperinsulinemia, hyperglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis, relieved hepatic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in aging rats. Furthermore, genipin not only improved insulin sensitivity by promoting insulin-stimulated glucose consumption and glycogen synthesis, inhibited cellular ROS overproduction and alleviated the reduction of levels of MMP and ATP, but also reversed oxidative stress-associated JNK hyperactivation and reduced Akt phosphorylation in palmitate-treated L02 hepatocytes. In conclusion, genipin ameliorates age-related insulin resistance through inhibiting hepatic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

     "abstract": "Multi-morbidity is common among older adults; however, for many aging-related diseases there is no information for U.S. elderly population on how earlier-manifested disease affects the risk of another disease manifested later during patient's lifetime. Quantitative evaluation of risks of cancer and non-cancer diseases for older adults with pre-existing conditions is performed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry data linked to the Medicare Files of Service Use (MFSU). Using the SEER-Medicare data containing individual records for 2,154,598 individuals, we empirically evaluated age patterns of incidence of age-associated diseases diagnosed after the onset of earlier manifested disease and compared these patterns with those in general population. Individual medical histories were reconstructed using information on diagnoses coded in MFSU, dates of medical services/procedures, and Medicare enrollment/disenrollment. More than threefold increase of subsequent diseases risk was observed for 15 disease pairs, majority of them were i) diseases of the same organ and/or system (e.g., Parkinson disease for patients with Alzheimer disease, HR\u00a0=\u00a03.77, kidney cancer for patients with renal failure, HR\u00a0=\u00a03.28) or ii) disease pairs with primary diseases being fast-progressive cancers (i.e., lung, kidney, and pancreas), e.g., ulcer (HR\u00a0=\u00a04.68) and melanoma (HR\u00a0=\u00a04.15) for patients with pancreatic cancer. Lower risk of subsequent disease was registered for 20 disease pairs, mostly among patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, e.g., decreased lung cancer risk among patients with Alzheimer's (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.64) and Parkinson's (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.60) disease. Synergistic and antagonistic dependences in geriatric disease risks were observed among US elderly confirming known and detecting new associations of wide spectrum of age-associated diseases. The results can be used in optimization of screening, prevention and treatment strategies of chronic diseases among U.S. elderly population.",

Forty-eight well functioning older adults (70.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0years old; 20 men, 28 women) were included in this study. Two median splits were conducted based on each individual's performance for the 10MWT and TUG. Comparisons between groups of slower and faster individuals were made with regard to executive functions and physical fitness parameters. A correlational approach was used to assess the association between variables.Between groups comparisons revealed that faster individuals in mobility tests demonstrate better performances in measures of cognitive flexibility (0.68\u00a0<\u00a0g\u00a0<\u00a00.90). After including covariates from the medical/social domain, significant correlations were established between faster mobility tests and better cognitive flexibility (TUG: r\u00a0=\u00a00.565; 10MWT: r\u00a0=\u00a00.324). Between groups comparisons also revealed that faster individuals in mobility tests presented higher physical fitness levels (aerobic: 0.49\u00a0<\u00a0g\u00a0<\u00a00.77, strength: 0.34\u00a0<\u00a0g\u00a0<\u00a01.31).

Increased levels of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase staining were found in aortas of SAMP8 and SAMR1 with WD. In SAMR1, WD did not modify Phe contraction in spite of inducing major changes in the mechanisms of regulation of contractile responses. Although WD increased NAD(P)H-oxidase-derived O2\u2212 and augmented peroxynitrite formation, we found an increase of inducible NOS (iNOS)-derived NO production which may contribute to maintain Phe contraction in SAMR1 WD. On SAMP8, WD significantly decreased Phe-induced contractions when compared with SAMP8 under normal chow. This response was not dependent on changes of NOS expression, but rather as consequence of increased antioxidant capacity by superoxide dismutase (SOD1). A similar constrictor influence from cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway on Phe responses was found in SAMR1 and SAMP8 ND. However, WD removed that influence on SAMR1, and produced a switch in the balance from a vasoconstrictor to a vasodilator component in SAMP8. These results were associated to the increased COX-2 expression, suggesting that a COX-2-derived vasodilator prostaglandin may contribute to the vascular adaptations after WD intake. Taken together, our data suggest that WD plays a detrimental role in the vasculature of non-senescent mice by increasing pro-inflammatory (iNOS) and pro-oxidative signaling pathways and may contribute to increase vascular senescence. In senescent vessels, however, WD triggers different intrinsic compensatory alterations which include increase of antioxidant activity by SOD1 and vasodilator prostaglandin production via COX-2.",

     "abstract": "Aging results from an accumulation of damage to macromolecules inhibiting cellular replication, repair, and other necessary functions. Damage may be due to environmental stressors such as metal toxicity, oxidative stress caused by imperfections in electron transfer reactions, or other metabolic processes. In an effort to discover medical treatments that counteract this damage, we initiated a search for small molecule drugs from natural sources using life table experiments which, through their unbiased approach, present the opportunity to discover first-in-class molecules. We have identified marine red algae as a source of natural products that slow aging of the invertebrate rotifer Brachionus manjavacas. Rotifers are a promising model organism for life extension studies as they maintain a short, measurable lifespan while also having an extensive literature related to aging. Rotifer lifespan was increased 9\u201314% by exposure to three of a total of 200 screened red algal extracts. Bioassay guided fractionation led to semi-purified extracts composed primarily of lipids responsible for rotifer life extension. The life extending mixture from the red alga Acanthophora spicifera contained eicosanoic, octadecanoic, and hexadecanoic acids as well as several unidentified unsaturated fatty acids. The life extending effects of these small molecule mixtures are not a result of their direct antioxidant capacity; other unknown mechanisms of action are likely involved. An understanding of how these natural products interact with their molecular targets could lead to selective and effective treatments for slowing aging and reducing age related diseases.",

The association between baseline serum vitamin E and cognitive impairment was analyzed with multiple logistic regression after adjusting for several confounders.The risk of cognitive impairment was lower in subjects in the middle tertile of the \u03b3-tocopherol/cholesterol ratio than in those in the lowest tertile: the multiadjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was 0.27 (0.10\u20130.78). Higher incidence of cognitive impairment was found in the middle [OR (95% CI): 3.41 (1.29\u20139.06)] and highest [OR (95% CI): 2.89 (1.05\u20137.97)] tertiles of the 5-NO2-\u03b3-tocopherol/\u03b3-tocopherol ratio. Analyses of absolute serum levels of vitamin E showed lower risk of cognitive impairment in subjects with higher levels of \u03b3-tocopherol, \u03b2-tocotrienol, and total tocotrienols.Elevated levels of tocopherol and tocotrienol forms are associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment in older adults. The association is modulated by concurrent cholesterol concentration. Various vitamin E forms might play a role in cognitive impairment, and their evaluation can provide a more accurate measure of vitamin E status in humans.",

This study compares the thymic output and peripheral blood telomere length in \u2265\u00a070\u00a0year old cancer patients.Fifty-two elderly cancer patients and 39 age-matched controls without personal history of cancer were enrolled. All patients underwent a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), from which a multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) score was calculated. Peripheral blood samples were studied for na\u00efve and recent thymic emigrant (RTE) CD4+ and CD8+ cells by flow cytometry. T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circle (TREC) levels, telomere length and telomerase activity in peripheral blood cells were quantified by real-time PCR.The percentages of CD8+ na\u00efve and CD8+ RTE cells and TREC levels were significantly lower in cancer patients than in controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004, p\u00a0=\u00a00.031, respectively).

Neither unfitness on CGA nor MPI score were significantly related to thymic output or telomere length in either group.Immune senescence is significantly worse in elderly cancer patients than in age-matched controls. The low thymic output and the shorter telomeres in peripheral blood cells of cancer patients may reflect a pre-existing condition which facilitates the onset of malignancies in elderly people.",

     "abstract": "To examine the association between dietary habits, cognitive functioning and brain volumes in older individuals, data from 194 cognitively healthy individuals who participated in the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors cohort were used. At age 70, participants kept diaries of their food intake for 1\u00a0week. These records were used to calculate a Mediterranean diet (MeDi) score (comprising dietary habits traditionally found in Mediterranean countries, e.g. high intake of fruits and low intake of meat), with higher scores indicating more pronounced MeDi-like dietary habits. Five years later, participants' cognitive capabilities were examined by the seven minute screening (7MS) (a cognitive test battery used by clinicians to screen for dementia), and their brain volumes were measured by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate linear regression analyses were constructed to examine the association between the total MeDi score and cognitive functioning and brain volumes. In addition, possible associations between MeDi's eight dietary features and cognitive functioning and brain volumes were investigated. From the eight dietary features included in the MeDi score, pertaining to a low consumption of meat and meat products was linked to a better performance on the 7MS test (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and greater total brain volume (i.e. the sum of white and gray matter, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) when controlling for potential confounders (e.g. BMI) in the analysis. Integrating all dietary features into the total MeDi score explained less variance in cognitive functioning and brain volumes than its single dietary component meat intake. These observational findings suggest that keeping to a low meat intake could prove to be an impact-driven public health policy to support healthy cognitive aging, when confirmed by longitudinal studies. Further, they suggest that the MeDi score is a construct that may mask possible associations of single MeDi features with brain health domains in elderly populations.",

Although the effect of CR on lifespan extension has been investigated for nearly 80\u00a0years, the molecular mechanisms of CR are still elusive. Consequently, it is important to understand the fundamental mechanisms of when and how lifespan is affected by CR. In this study, we first identified the time-windows during which CR assured cellular longevity by switching cells from culture media containing 2% or 0.5% glucose to water, which allows us to observe CR and non-calorically-restricted cells under the same conditions. We also constructed time-dependent gene expression profiles and selected 646 genes that showed significant changes and correlations with the lifespan-extending effect of CR. The positively correlated genes participated in transcriptional regulation, ribosomal RNA processing and nuclear genome stability, while the negatively correlated genes were involved in the regulation of several metabolic pathways, endoplasmic reticulum function, stress response and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, we discovered major upstream regulators of those significantly changed genes, including AZF1 (YOR113W), HSF1 (YGL073W) and XBP1 (YIL101C). Deletions of two genes, AZF1 and XBP1 (HSF1 is essential and was thus not tested), were confirmed to lessen the lifespan extension mediated by CR. The absence of these genes in the tor1\u0394 and ras2\u0394 backgrounds did show non-overlapping effects with regard to CLS, suggesting differences between the CR mechanism for Tor and Ras signaling.",

After 2\u00a0weeks, 2\u00a0months, 6\u00a0months and 12\u00a0months, sections of their hearts were analyzed in five areas\u2014left ventricle, interventricular septum, right ventricle, anterior and posterior wall. Nerve fibers were visualized immunohistochemically, using antibody against a general neuronal marker, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5).Significant increase in total nerve fibers from all heart areas was observed 2\u00a0weeks and 2\u00a0months after diabetes induction, followed by a decrease at 6\u00a0months and again increase at 12\u00a0months was observed in both control and diabetic rats. Significant difference between control and diabetic rats was visible after 2\u00a0weeks and 2\u00a0months, with diabetic rats exhibiting significantly more nerve fibers. There were no consistent differences in quantity of nerve fibers in different areas of the heart within a particular age-related group of animals.In conclusion, cardiac innervation undergoes dynamic changes both in control and in diabetic rats, with a time-dependent significant increase in neuronal fiber density in diabetic animals.

The use of isoperformance curves is presented as a method for this determination. Baseline values from 107 healthy Caucasian men and women, over the age of 65\u00a0years old, who participated in a separate longitudinal study, were used for this investigation. Field-based measurements of age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and handgrip strength were recorded on an individual basis. Relative skeletal muscle index (RSMI) and body fat percentage (FAT%) were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for each participant. Sarcopenia cut-off values for RSMI of 7.26\u00a0kg\u00b7m\u2212\u00a02 for men and 5.45\u00a0kg\u00b7m\u2212\u00a02 for women and elderly obesity cut-off values for FAT% of 27% for men and 38% for women were used. Individuals above the RSMI cut-off and below the FAT% cut-off were classified in the normal phenotype category, while individuals below the RSMI cut-off and above the FAT% cut-off were classified in the sarcopenic-obese phenotype category. Prediction equations for RSMI and FAT% from sex, BMI, and handgrip strength values were developed using multiple regression analysis. The prediction equations were validated using double cross-validation. The final regression equation developed to predict FAT% from sex, BMI, and handgrip strength resulted in a strong relationship (adjusted R2\u00a0=\u00a00.741) to DXA values with a low standard error of the estimate (SEE\u00a0=\u00a03.994%).

Isoperformance curves were developed from the relationship between BMI and handgrip strength for men and women with the aforementioned clinical phenotype classification criteria.

Using resting-state fMRI and seed regions of interest in the left and right fronto-insular (FI) cortices, we explored the neurobiological substrate of temporal discounting in 123 non-demented older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. For the left FI cortex, temporal discounting was positively associated with functional connectivity to the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and middle temporal regions, and negatively associated with parahippocampal and right cerebellar regions. For the right FI cortex, temporal discounting was negatively associated with functional connectivity to a right cerebellar region. Connectivity maps of both left and right seed regions of interest overlapped in the right cerebellum.

When combined with the AGE-crosslink breaker Alagebrium, exercise training reverses cardiovascular aging in experimental animals. This study is the first to examine the effect of Alagebrium, with and without exercise training, on endothelial function, arterial stiffness and cardiovascular risk in older individuals. Forty-eight non-exercising individuals (mean age 70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years) without manifest diseases or use of medication were allocated into 4 groups for a 1-year intervention: Exercise training & Alagebrium (200\u00a0mg/day); exercise training & placebo; no exercise training & Alagebrium (200\u00a0mg/day); and no exercise training & placebo. We performed a maximal exercise test (VO2max) and measured endothelial function using venous occlusion plethysmography and intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and NG-monomethyl-l-arginine. Arterial stiffness was measured using pulse wave velocity. Cardiovascular risk was calculated using the Lifetime Risk Score (LRS). In the exercise training groups, LRS and VO2max improved significantly (23.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5 to 27.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6mLO2/min/kg, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Endothelial response to the vasoactive substances did not change, nor did arterial stiffness in any of the four groups. In conclusion, one year of exercise training significantly improved physical fitness and lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease without affecting endothelial function or arterial stiffness. The use of the AGE-crosslink breaker Alagebrium had no independent effect on vascular function, nor did it potentiate the effect of exercise training. Despite the clinical benefits of exercise training for older individuals, neither exercise training nor Alagebrium (alone or in combination) was able to reverse the vascular effects of decades of sedentary aging.",

Compared to the young animals, the primary hepatocytes from old rats showed a higher glucose output and a higher expression of the key gluconeogenesis-regulating enzyme, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). The primary hepatocytes from old rats showed a higher glucose output and a higher expression of the key gluconeogenesis-regulating enzyme, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), compared with those from the young animals. The in situ hybridization study showed increased PEPCK mRNA expression in the aged liver tissues. The livers from old rats showed loosened hexagonal hepatic lobular structures, increased collagen accumulation, and high expression of the hypoxia marker hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). Hypoxia increased the PEPCK mRNA and protein expression levels in accordance with the HIF1\u03b1 expression. PEPCK promoter luciferase reporter assay showed that hypoxia increased PEPCK through transcriptional activation. Furthermore, the hepatocyte nuclear factor \u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1) protein, but not the HNF4\u03b1 mRNA level, increased in parallel with the PEPCK mRNA expression under hypoxic conditions. Glucose production increased under hypoxic conditions, but this increment diminished by HNF4\u03b1 siRNA in young hepatocytes. Moreover, increased glucose production from old rat hepatocytes was reversed by the down-regulation of HNF4\u03b1 through a specific siRNA. This study suggests that the mild hypoxic conditions in response to aging-dependent hepatic structural changes may contribute to the induction of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK through HNF4\u03b1 protein stabilization.",

     "abstract": "Life-history theory maintains that organisms allocate limited resources to different traits to maximize fitness. Learning ability and memory are costly and known to trade-off with longevity in invertebrates. However, since the relationship between longevity and fitness often differs between the sexes, it is likely that sexes will differentially resolve the trade-off between learning and longevity. We used an established associative learning paradigm in the dioecious nematode Caenorhabditis remanei, which is sexually dimorphic for lifespan, to study age-related learning ability in males and females. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that females (the shorter-lived sex) show higher learning ability than males early in life but senesce faster. Indeed, young females outperformed young males in learning a novel association between an odour (butanone) and food (bacteria). However, while learning ability and offspring production declined rapidly with age in females, males maintained high levels of these traits until mid-age. These results not only demonstrate sexual dimorphism in age-related learning ability but also suggest that it conforms to predictions derived from the life-history theory.",

OGT attaches an O-GlcNAc moiety to proteins, while O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes O-GlcNAc removal. In skeletal muscle of experimental animals, prolonged increase in O-GlcNAcylation associates with age and muscle atrophy. Here we examined the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and power training (PT) on muscle OGT and OGA gene expression in postmenopausal women generally prone to age-related muscle weakness. In addition, the associations of OGT and OGA gene expressions with muscle phenotype were analyzed. Twenty-seven 50\u201357-year-old women participated in a yearlong randomized placebo-controlled trial: HRT (n\u00a0=\u00a010), PT (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and control (n\u00a0=\u00a09). OGT and OGA mRNA levels were measured from muscle samples obtained at baseline and after one year. Knee extensor muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), knee extension force, running speed and vertical jumping height were measured. During the yearlong intervention, HRT suppressed the aging-associated upregulation of OGT mRNA that occurred in the controls. The effects of PT were similar but weaker. HRT also tended to increase the OGA mRNA level compared to the controls. The change in the ratio of OGT to OGA gene expressions correlated negatively with the change in muscle CSA. Our results suggest that OGT and OGA gene expressions are associated with muscle size during the critical postmenopausal period. HRT and PT influence muscle OGT and OGA gene expression, which may be one of the mechanisms by which HRT and PT prevent aging-related loss of muscle mass.",

A correct diagnosis entails the choice of appropriate therapies. In this view the present study aimed to identify biomarkers that could improve the differential diagnosis. We recently found an overexpression of platelet amyloid precursor protein (APP) in AD; furthermore, recent studies have suggested the presence of changes in APP processing in FTLD. In this context, we analyzed the mRNA expression level of Total APP (TOT) and APP containing a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor domain (KPI) in platelets obtained from AD patients, subjects with FTLD, and healthy subjects. In addition, we evaluated the correlation between platelet APP mRNA expression levels and cognitive impairment.Differential gene expression measurements revealed a significant up-regulation of APP TOT and APP KPI in both AD and FTLD patients compared to the controls (being AD/Controls: 1.67 for APP TOT and 1.47 for APP KPI; FTLD/Controls: 1.62 for APP TOT and 1.51 for APP KPI; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), although it is interesting to note that in FTLD patients this expression did not correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment.This could be related to a reduced beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) formation, caused by an alteration of secretase enzymatic activity, even though a post-transcriptional regulation of APP mRNAs in FTLD cannot be excluded.",

The classification of respondents by physical activity was based on answers to the question if, in the past 12\u00a0months, they engaged in any pastimes which require physical activity. The systemic oxidative stress status was assessed by measuring plasma iso-PGF2\u03b1 and protein carbonyl concentration as well as erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes activity, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR). The concentration of plasma iso-PGF2\u03b1 and protein carbonyls (CP) was lower in groups of younger men and women compared to the respective older groups. In all examined groups, physical activity resulted in decrease of these oxidative stress markers and simultaneously caused adaptive increase in the erythrocyte SOD activity. Additionally, in active younger men CAT, GPx, and GR activities were higher than in sedentary ones. In conclusion, oxidative stress increase is age-related, but physical activity can reduce oxidative stress markers and induce adaptive increase in the erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activity, especially SOD, even in old and very old men and women.",

Ultrasound was used to measure medial gastrocnemius (MG) fascicle length during maximal voluntary isometric contractions and supra-maximal isometric twitch contractions at five ankle angles throughout the available range of motion, as well as isokinetic concentric and eccentric contractions at four ankle velocities. Maximum voluntary activation of the plantar flexors was assessed using the twitch interpolation technique. Peak plantar flexor torque was significantly lower in older adults compared to young participants by 42%, 28% and 43% during maximal voluntary isometric contractions, supra-maximal isometric twitch and concentric contractions respectively. No age-related differences in eccentric torque production were detected. When age-related differences in triceps surae muscle volume determined from MRI were taken into account, the age-related peak plantar flexor torque deficits for maximum voluntary isometric, supra-maximal twitch, and concentric contractions were 24%, 19% and 24% respectively. These age-related differences in torque were not explained by torque\u2013length\u2013velocity behaviour of the MG muscle fascicles, passive plantar flexor torque\u2013angle properties, decreased neural drive of the plantar flexor muscles or antagonistic co-activation of the tibialis anterior muscle. The residual deficit in isometric and concentric plantar flexor torques in healthy older adults may involve reduced muscle quality. A significant reduction in supra-maximal twitch torque at longer MG fascicle lengths as well as a lower MG fascicle velocity during eccentric contractions in older adults was detected, which could possibly be a function of the reported increased Achilles tendon compliance in older adults.",

     "abstract": "Although much is known about female reproductive aging, fairly little is known about the causes of male reproductive senescence. We developed a method that facilitates culture maintenance of Caenorhabditis elegans adult males, which enabled us to measure male fertility as populations age, without profound loss of males from the growth plate. We find that the ability of males to sire progeny declines rapidly in the first half of adult lifespan and we examined potential factors that contribute towards reproductive success, including physical vigor, sperm quality, mating apparatus morphology, and mating ability. Of these, we find little evidence of general physical decline in males or changes in sperm number, morphology, or capacity for activation, at time points when reproductive senescence is markedly evident. Rather, it is the loss of efficient mating ability that correlates most strongly with reproductive senescence. Low insulin signaling can extend male ability to sire progeny later in life, although insulin impact on individual facets of mating behavior is complex. Overall, we suggest that combined modest deficits, predominantly affecting the complex mating behavior rather than sperm quality, sum up to block effective C. elegans male reproduction in middle adult life.",

As expected, aged dietary restricted rats displayed about 20% higher survival rate than age-matched rats fed ad libitum. This difference was reflected also in the auditory system. In the dietary restricted group, 73% of the subjects had preserved auditory reflexes (Preyer), and only modest degeneration of the stria vascularis of the inner ear was observed. In contrast, aged ad libitum fed animals, of which only 15% had detectable Preyer reflexes, showed a marked thinning, cellular degeneration and loss of cell processes in the stria vascularis. The extent of loss of sensory hair cells (~\u00a024%) was similar in both the aged groups, and neither group showed a significant reduction in the number of spiral ganglion neurons across adult life-span. The observations thus demonstrate that dietary restriction delays age-related degradation of the auditory system. The results provide further insights into the mechanisms of strial presbycusis.",

     "abstract": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is anorexic, irrespective whether it is applied intraperitoneally (IP) or intracerebroventricularly (ICV) in male Wistar rats. The metabolic effects depend on the route of administration: by the IP route it elicits hypothermia (presumably by type-1 receptors, CCK1R-s), while ICV administration is followed by fever-like hypermetabolism and hyperthermia via activation of CCK2R-s, which latter response seems to be most important in the postprandial (compensatory) hypermetabolism. The efficacy of the IP injected CCK varies with age: it causes strong anorexia in young adult 4 and 6-months old and again in old rats (aged 18\u201324\u00a0months), but the middle-aged (12-month old) ones seem to be resistant to this effect. Such pattern of effects may contribute to the explanation of age-related obesity observed in middle-aged animals as well as to the aging anorexia and loss of body weight in old ones. Diet-induced obesity accelerates the appearance of CCK-resistance as well as the return of high sensitivity to CCK in further aging, while chronic calorie-restriction prevents the development of resistance, as if the speed of the age-related regulatory changes was altered by the nutritional state. The effects of ICV applied CCK also change with age: the characteristic anorexic and hypermetabolic/hyperthermic effects can be observed in young adult rats, but the effects gradually and monotonically decline with age and disappear by the old age of 24\u00a0months. These disparate age-related patterns of CCK efficacy upon peripheral or central administration routes may indicate that although both peripheral and central CCKR-s exert anorexic effects, they may have dissimilar roles in the regulation of overall energy balance.",

However, it is known that performance in a controlled laboratory setting is not necessarily representative of performance in nature. In this study the effect of ageing, environmental temperature and longevity selection on performance in the field was tested. Flies from longevity selected and control lines of different ages (2, 5, 10 and 15\u00a0days) were released in an environment free of natural food sources. Control flies were tested at low, intermediate and high temperatures, while longevity selected flies were tested at the intermediate temperature only. The ability of flies to locate and reach a food source was tested. Flies of intermediate age were generally better at locating resources than both younger and older flies, where hot and cold environments accelerate the senescent decline in performance. Control lines were better able to locate a resource compared to longevity selected lines of the same age, suggesting that longevity comes at a cost in early life field fitness, supporting the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of ageing.",

Mature adipocytes were isolated from liposuction samples of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue collected from both young (26.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3 (mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD); n\u00a0=\u00a07) and old (52.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7 (mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD); n\u00a0=\u00a07) obese individuals. Total protein extracts were then compared by two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE). Thirty differentially expressed protein spots (ANOVA test, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; fold-change \u2265\u00a01.8) were detected, of which, 15 were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. These were comprised of a total of thirteen unique protein sequences. Nine proteins were more abundant in the adipocytes isolated from old vs. young individuals. These proteins included prohibitin 1, protein disulphide isomerase A3, beta actin, profilin, aldo-ketoreductase 1 C2, alpha crystallin B and the annexins A1, A5 and A6. Four other proteins were less abundant in the adipocytes from old, obese subjects and these included keratin type 2 cytoskeletal 1, keratin type 2 cytoskeletal 10 and hemoglobins A and B. The differentially abundant proteins were investigated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to reveal their associations with known biological functions. This analysis identified signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 as the central molecule in the connectivity map and the apoptotic pathway as the pathway with the highest score. Differences in the abundances of several proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting: i.e., prohibitin 1, protein disulphide isomerase A3, beta actin, profilin and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 proteins. In conclusion, proteomic analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue reveals differences in the abundance of proteins in adipocytes isolated from young vs. old individuals. These differentially abundant proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, cellular senescence and inflammatory response. All these are common pathologic events in both obesity and aging.",

In separate experiments, the effects of anesthesia and the cytokine response (IL-6) following surgery were evaluated.Increased age was associated with changes in affective behavior, decreased cognitive flexibility and increased microglia activation as well as increased weight loss and plasma IL-6 following surgery. No effects of surgery on cognition were observed at either age. However, aged rats displayed long-term changes in affective behavior and had increased microgliosis in the CA1 hippocampal region following surgery. Microglia activation following surgery was positively correlated to parameters of behavior and spatial learning.These findings support the hypothesis that elderly patients have an increased behavioral and (neuro)inflammatory response to surgery and these factors may be related.",

Energy expenditure (EE) was examined by doubly labeled water (DLW; TEE) and respiratory chamber (24\u00a0h EE). Physical activity was assessed both by metabolic equivalent (MET) in a respiratory chamber and by an accelerometer. Metabolic cost of movements during 24\u00a0h was also calculated. Age and fat-free mass were included as covariates.Adjusted total and 24\u00a0h EE were not different between C and CR. Sleeping metabolic rate was significantly lower, and physical activity level was higher in CR than in C independent from the CR-induced changes in body composition. The duration of physical activity above 1.6 METs was significantly higher in CR than in C, and CR had significantly higher accelerometer activity counts than C. Metabolic cost of movements during 24\u00a0h was significantly lower in CR than in C. The accelerometer activity counts were significantly decreased after seven years in C animals, but not in CR animals.The results suggest that long-term CR decreases basal metabolic rate, but maintains higher physical activity with lower metabolic cost of movements compared with C.",

The interventions lasted 10\u00a0weeks and each group performed identical exercise intensity and volume per session. Before and after the exercise training, one maximum repetition test (1RM), isometric peak torque (PT), maximal surface electromyographic activity (EMG), as well as muscle thickness (MT) were examined. Additionally, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), maximum aerobic workload (Wmax), first and second ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2) were evaluated. There were significant increases in upper and lower-body 1RM, MT, VO2peak, VT1 and VT2, with no differences between groups. There were no changes after training in maximal EMG and isometric peak torque. Wmax was improved only in SE3. After 10\u00a0weeks of training, twice weekly combined strength and endurance training leads to similar neuromuscular and cardiovascular adaptations as three times per week, demonstrating the efficiency of lower frequency of concurrent training in previously trained elderly men.",

Furthermore, in female rats, aging is associated with the altered macrophage functioning and the increased estrogen level is followed by a decrease in that of progesterone. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the influence of estradiol/progesterone balance on rat macrophage function and phenotype throughout whole adult lifespan. We ovariectomized rats at the late prepubertal age or at the very end of reproductive lifespan, and examined the expression of ED2 (CD163, a marker of mature resident macrophages related to secretion of inflammatory mediators) on peritoneal macrophages and their ability to produce TNF-\u03b1 and NO upon LPS-stimulation at different age points. In addition, to delineate direct and indirect effects of estrogen, we assessed the in vitro influence of different concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol on LPS-induced macrophage TNF-\u03b1 and NO production. Results showed that: (a) the low frequency of ED2high cells amongst peritoneal macrophages of aged rats was accompanied with the reduced TNF-\u03b1, but not NO production; (b) estradiol level gradually increased following ovariectomy; (c) macrophage ED2 expression and TNF-\u03b1 production were dependent on estradiol/progesterone balance and they changed in the same direction; (d) changes in estradiol/progesterone balance differentially affected macrophages TNF-\u03b1 and NO production; and (e) estradiol exerted pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Overall, our study discloses that estradiol/progesterone balance contributes to the fine-tuning of rat macrophage secretory capacity, and adds to a better understanding of the ovarian steroid hormone role in the regulation of macrophage function, and its significance for the age-associated changes in innate immunity.",

Ninety women completed seven sets of ten repetitions (eccentric only) of an acute ERE session at 110% of the ten repetitions maximum (10RM). IL-6 genotypes displayed no difference at baseline. ERE induced changes in CK concentration over time occurred only in the GG group, F(2.619, 136.173)\u00a0=\u00a05.199, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, with CK activity increased from 106.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.9\u00a0U/l pre-intervention to 122.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.2\u00a0U/l at 24\u00a0h and 131.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.4\u00a0U/l at 48\u00a0h post-exercise.

We investigated whether individuals in the Nicoya region of Costa Rica, known for exceptional longevity, had longer telomere length than those in other parts of the country. After controlling for age, age squared, rurality, rainy season and gender, the mean leukocyte telomere length in Nicoya was substantially longer (81 base pairs, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than in other areas of Costa Rica, providing evidence of a biological pathway to which this notable longevity may be related. This relationship remains unchanged (79 base pairs, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after statistically controlling for nineteen potential biological, dietary and social and demographic mediators. Thus the difference in the mean leukocyte telomere length that characterizes this unique region does not appear to be explainable by traditional behavioral and biological risk factors. More detailed examination of mean leukocyte telomere length by age shows that the regional telomere length difference declines at older ages.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1\u03b1 in the potential beneficial effects of exercise training and/or resveratrol in the prevention of age-associated low-grade inflammation. To address this, a long-term voluntary exercise training and resveratrol supplementation study was conducted.Three month old whole body PGC-1\u03b1 KO and WT mice were randomly assigned to four groups: untrained chow-fed, untrained chow-fed supplemented with resveratrol, chow-fed voluntarily exercise trained and chow-fed supplemented with resveratrol and voluntarily exercise trained. The intervention lasted 12\u00a0months and three month old untrained chow-fed mice served as young controls.Voluntary exercise training prevented an age-associated increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in systemic IL-6 and adiposity in WT mice.

Independently of PGC-1\u03b1, both exercise training and resveratrol prevented an age-associated increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in skeletal muscle protein carbonylation.The present findings highlight that exercise training is a more effective intervention than resveratrol supplementation in reducing age-associated inflammation and that PGC-1\u03b1 in part is required for the exercise training-induced anti-inflammatory effects.",

     "abstract": "Chronic, low grade inflammation is a characteristic of old age. Innate immune system cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) from the elderly display a pro-inflammatory phenotype associated with increased reactivity to self. Lithium is a well-established anti-inflammatory agent used in the treatment of bipolar disorders. It has also been reported to reduce inflammation in DCs. Here, we investigated whether Lithium is effective in reducing the inflammatory responses in DCs from the elderly. The effect of Lithium Chloride (LiCl) was compared on the response of TLR4 agonist, LPS and TLR2 agonist, PAM3CSK4 stimulated aged and young DCs. LiCl enhanced the production of IL-10 in LPS stimulated young DCs. However, it did not affect TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production. In contrast, in aged DCs, LiCl reduced the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in LPS stimulated DCs but did not increase IL-10. LiCl had no significant effect on PAM3CSK4 responses in aged and young DCs. LiCl treated DCs also displayed differences at the level of CD4 T cell priming and polarization. LPS-stimulated young DCs reduced IFN-\u03b3 secretion and biased the Th cell response towards Th2/Treg while LiCl treated aged DCs only reduced IFN-\u03b3 secretion but did not bias the response towards Th2/Treg. In summary, our data suggests that LiCl reduces inflammation in aged and young DCs via different mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect of LiCl is different on LPS and PAM3CSK4 responses.",

     "abstract": "The rise in non-heme iron (NHI) concentration observed in skeletal muscle of aging rodents is thought to contribute to the development of sarcopenia. The source of the NHI has not been identified, nor have the physiological ramifications of elevated iron status in aged muscle been directly examined. Therefore, we assessed plantaris NHI and heme iron (HI) levels in addition to expression of proteins involved in iron uptake (transferrin receptor-1; TfR1), storage (ferritin), export (ferroportin; FPN), and regulation (iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) and -2 (IRP2)) of male F344xBN F1 rats (n\u00a0=\u00a010/group) of various ages (8, 18, 28, 32, and 36\u00a0months) to further understand iron regulation in aging muscle. In a separate experiment, iron chelator (pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone; PIH) or vehicle was administered to male F344xBN F1 rats (n\u00a0=\u00a08/group) beginning at 30\u00a0months of age to assess the impact on plantaris muscle mass and function at ~\u00a036\u00a0months of age. Principle findings revealed the increased NHI concentration in old age was consistent with concentrating effects of muscle atrophy and reduction in HI levels, with no change in the total iron content of the muscle. The greatest increase in muscle iron content occurred during the period of animal growth and was associated with downregulation of TfR1 and IRP2 expression. Ferritin upregulation did not occur until senescence and the protein remained undetectable during the period of muscle iron content elevation. Lastly, administration of PIH did not significantly (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) impact NHI or measures of muscle atrophy or contractile function. In summary, this study confirms that the elevated NHI concentration in old age is largely due to the loss in muscle mass. The increased muscle iron content during aging does not appear to associate with cytosolic ferritin storage, but the functional consequences of elevated iron status in old age remains to be determined.",

Both SAMR1 and SAMP8 were studied at three different ages: 3 (young), 6 (middle age) and 10 (old) months. Concentration\u2013response curves to phenylephrine (10\u2212\u00a08 to 10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0M) or acetylcholine (10\u2212\u00a09 to 10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0M) were performed in the aortic rings in the absence or in the presence of NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME (10\u2212\u00a04\u00a0M). Protein and gene expression for endothelial NOS (eNOS) was determined by immunofluorescence, Western blot and real-time PCR. Although we have not seen any difference in vascular responses when comparing both strains at 3\u00a0months old, we found a significant aging-associated impairment of vascular reactivity that follows a distinct time-course in SAMR1 and SAMP8. In SAMR1, increases in phenylephrine contraction and decreases in acetylcholine relaxation were only seen at 10\u00a0months old, while SAMP8 displays altered responses at 6\u00a0months that are further impaired at 10\u00a0months old. L-NAME treatment enhanced phenylephrine contractions and completely inhibited acetylcholine relaxations in all age groups of SAMR1 and SAMP8. However, the magnitude of increase in phenylephrine contraction by L-NAME was markedly reduced by aging and followed a faster pace in SAMP8. Similar pattern of responses was observed in the time course for changes of eNOS expression, suggesting an earlier and more pronounced aging-associated decrease of NO production and eNOS expression in SAMP8. These results reveal that aging enhances contractile responses to phenylephrine and decreases endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine in the aorta from female mice by a mechanism that involves a decrease of NO production. This process occurs earlier in the aorta from SAMP8 mice, establishing these mice as suitable model to study cardiovascular aging in a convenient and standard time course.",

     "abstract": "Population trajectories of age-specific fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster typically decline with increasing age and then exhibit an upward inflection, or \u201cplateau\u201d, at the oldest ages. This pattern has been interpreted as evidence of an evolved and physiologically distinct life history stage in late life. While low levels of fecundity are common in the last few days of life of individual flies, it is unclear that defining a single age as the beginning of a period of low fecundity for the entire cohort is useful, since reproductive life spans vary substantially from fly to fly. Here I analyze published data on survival and reproduction of individual female flies and show that non-linearities in late-life fecundity trajectories arise from a type of demographic selection that occurs when sub-groups with different reproductive life spans (RLS) are mixed. For groups of flies stratified by RLS late-life fecundity declines linearly with age. A simulation incorporating strictly linear decline of individual fecundities and realistic levels of variation in RLS produces late-life plateaus similar to those observed in experiments. Existing population heterogeneity is a sufficient explanation, and no special evolutionary argument is required. For these data survival and reproduction are governed by positive correlations.",

     "abstract": "Aged skeletal muscle demonstrates declines in muscle mass and deterioration of mitochondrial content and function. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 co-activator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) plays an important role in promoting muscle mitochondrial biogenesis in response to exercise training, but its role in senescent muscle is not clear. In the present study we hypothesize that a downregulation of the PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathway contributes to mitochondrial deterioration in aged muscle whereas endurance training ameliorates the deficits. Three groups of Fischer 344/BNF1 rats were used: young, sedentary (Y, 4\u00a0months); old, sedentary (O, 22\u00a0months); and old trained (OT, 22\u00a0months), subjected to treadmill running at 17.5\u00a0m/min, 10% grade for 45\u00a0min/day, 5\u00a0days/week for 12-weeks. PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA and nuclear PGC-1\u03b1 protein content in the soleus muscle were both decreased in O vs. Y rats, whereas OT rats showed a 2.3 and 1.8-fold higher PGC-1\u03b1 content than O and Y rats, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), cytochrome c (Cyt c) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA contents were significantly decreased in O vs. Y rats, but elevated by 2.2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), 1.4 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 2.4-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), respectively, in OT vs. O rats. In addition, Tfam and mtDNA showed 1.6 and 1.8-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) higher levels, respectively, in OT vs. Y rats. These adaptations were accompanied by significant increases in the expression of the phosphorylated form of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and silent mating type information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in OT rats. Furthermore, OT rats showed great levels of phosphorylation in cAMP responsive element binding protein (p-CREB) and DNA binding compared to O and Y rats. These data indicate that endurance training can attenuate aging-associated decline in mitochondrial protein synthesis in skeletal muscle partly due to upregulation of PGC-1\u03b1 signaling.",

Despite being potentially more suitable for older adults, low-resistance exercise protocols have been less investigated. We compared the effects of high- and low-resistance training on muscle volume, muscle strength, and force\u2013velocity characteristics. Fifty-six older adults were randomly assigned to 12\u00a0weeks of leg press and leg extension training at either HIGH (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u201315 repetitions at 80% of one repetition maximum (1RM)), LOW (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a080\u2013100 repetitions at 20% of 1RM), or LOW\u00a0+ (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060 repetitions at 20% of 1RM, followed by 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u201320 repetitions at 40% of 1RM). All protocols ended with muscle failure. Leg press and leg extension of 1RM were measured at baseline and post intervention and before the first training session in weeks 5 and 9. At baseline and post intervention, muscle volume (MV) was measured by CT-scan. A Biodex dynamometer evaluated knee extensor static peak torque in different knee angles (PTstat90\u00b0, PTstat120\u00b0, PTstat150\u00b0), dynamic peak torque at different speeds (PTdyn60\u00b0s\u2212\u00a01, PTdyn180\u00b0s\u2212\u00a01, PTdyn240\u00b0s\u2212\u00a01), and speed of movement at 20% (S20), 40% (S40), and 60% (S60) of PTstat90\u00b0. HIGH and LOW\u00a0+ resulted in greater improvements in 1RM strength than LOW (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These differences were already apparent after week 5. Similar gains were found between groups in MV, PTstat, PTdyn60\u00b0s\u2212\u00a01, and PTdyn180\u00b0s\u2212\u00a01. No changes were reported in speed of movement. HIGH tended to improve PTdyn240\u00b0s\u2212\u00a01 more than LOW or LOW\u00a0+ (p\u00a0=\u00a00.064). In conclusion, high- and low-resistance exercises ending with muscle failure may be similarly effective for hypertrophy. High-resistance training led to a higher increase in 1RM strength than low-resistance training (20% of 1RM), but this difference disappeared when using a mixed low-resistance protocol in which the resistance was intensified within a single exercise set (40% of 1RM). Our findings support the need for more research on low-resistance programs in older age, in particular long-term training studies and studies focusing on residual effects after training cessation.",

     "abstract": "Various compositions of fatty acids can produce cell membranes with disparate fluidity and propensity for oxidation. The latter characteristic, which can be evaluated via the peroxidation index (PI), has a fundamental role in the development of the \u201cmembrane-pacemaker theory\u201d of aging. This study tried to evaluate differences between the membrane phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profile of longevity-selected (L) and corresponding control (C) lines of Drosophila melanogaster with age (3, 9, 14 and 19\u00a0days) and its consequences on phase transition temperature as a function of membrane fluidity. Despite an equal proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, PI and double bond index over all ages in both experimental groups, monounsaturated fatty acids showed significant variation with advancement of age in both L and C lines. A significant age-associated elevation of the unsaturation vs. saturation index in parallel with a gradual reduction of the mean melting point was observed in longevous flies. PLFA composition of the L vs. C lines revealed a dissimilarity in 3-day old samples, which was based on the positive loading of C14:0 and C18:3 as well as negative loading of C18:0. The findings of this study are not in agreement with the principle of the \u201cmembrane pacemaker theory\u201d linking PI and longevity. However, the physiochemical properties of PLFAs in longevity lines may retard the cells' senescence by maintaining optimal membrane functionality over time. Identical susceptibility to peroxidation of both types of lines underlines the involvement of other mechanisms in protecting the bio-membrane against oxidation, such as the reduced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species or improvement of the antioxidant defense system in longer-lived phenotypes. Concurrent assessments of these mechanisms in relation to cell membrane PLFA composition may clarify the cellular basis of lifespan in this species.",

For the aging model, d-galactose (100\u00a0mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously to 6-week-old male mice for 10\u00a0weeks. At 13\u00a0weeks of age, valerian root extracts (100\u00a0mg/kg) or valerenic acid (340\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) was administered orally to control and d-galactose-treated mice for 3\u00a0weeks. The dosage of valerenic acid (340\u00a0\u03bcg/kg), which is the active ingredient of valerian root extract, was determined by the content of valerenic acid in valerian root extract (3.401\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.066\u00a0mg/g) measured by HPLC. The administration of valerian root extract and valerenic acid significantly improved the preferential exploration of new objects in novel object recognition test and the escape latency, swimming speeds, platform crossings, and spatial preference for the target quadrant in Morris water maze test compared to the d-galactose-treated mice. Cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation were significantly decreased, while serum corticosterone level and lipid peroxidation in hippocampus were significantly increased in the d-galactose-treated group compared to that in the control group. The administration of valerian root extract significantly ameliorated these changes in the dentate gyrus of both control and d-galactose-treated groups. In addition, valerenic acid also mitigated the d-galactose-induced reduction of these changes. These results indicate that valerian root extract and valerenic acid enhance cognitive function, promote cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation, and reduce serum corticosterone and lipid peroxidation in aged mice.",

However, the characteristics of sirtuins in the retina, where local energy expenditure changes dynamically in response to light stimuli, are largely unknown.

We then analyzed the sirtuin mRNA profiles in the retina over time, under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (LD condition) and in constant darkness (DD condition). All seven sirtuins showed significant daily variation under the LD condition, with all except Sirt6 being increased in the dark phase. The expression patterns were different under the DD condition, suggesting that sirtuin mRNA levels except Sirt6 are affected by light\u2013dark condition.

Incremental stiffness and endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) were measured in the carotid arteries of young (5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0mo, N\u00a0=\u00a020) and old (30.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mo, N\u00a0=\u00a019) male B6D2F1 mice fed normal chow (NC: 17% fat, 0% sucrose) or a western diet (40% fat, 19% sucrose) and housed in either standard cages or cages equipped with running wheels for 10\u201314\u00a0weeks. Incremental stiffness was higher in old NC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and both young (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and old (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) WD fed mice compared with young NC mice, but WD did not further increase stiffness in the old mice. In cage control mice, maximal EDD was 17% lower in both NC fed old mice and young WD fed mice (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Consumption of WD by old mice led to a further 20% reduction in maximal EDD (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Incremental stiffness was 28% lower and maximal EDD was 38% greater in old WD fed mice with access to running wheels vs. old WD fed control mice (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and not different from young NC fed controls. Wheel running also tended to improve maximal EDD (+\u00a09%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.11), but not incremental stiffness in young WD fed mice. Ex vivo treatment with the superoxide scavenger TEMPOL and NO inhibitor l-NAME abolished these respective effects of age, WD and voluntary running on EDD. Ingestion of a WD induces similar degrees of endothelial dysfunction in old and young adult B6D2F1 mice, and these effects are mediated by a superoxide-dependent impairment of NO bioavailability. However, the combination of old age and WD, a common occurrence in our aging society, results in a marked, additive reduction in endothelial function. Importantly, regular voluntary aerobic exercise reduces arterial stiffness and protects against the adverse influence of WD on endothelial function in old animals by preventing superoxide suppression of NO. These findings may have important implications for arterial aging and the prevention of age-associated cardiovascular diseases.",

We found that repeated exercise regimen did not strengthen circadian locomotor activity rhythms in aging flies and had no effect on their lifespan. We also tested the effects of exercise on mobility and determined that regular exercise lowered age-specific climbing ability in both wild type and clock mutant flies.

To date, prolonged caloric restriction (i.e., a reduction in caloric intake without malnutrition) is the only non-genetic intervention that has consistently been found to extend both mean and maximal life span across a variety of species. Most individuals have difficulty sustaining prolonged caloric restriction, which has led to a search for alternative approaches that can produce similar to benefits as caloric restriction. A growing body of evidence indicates that fasting periods and intermittent fasting regimens in particular can trigger similar biological pathways as caloric restriction. For this reason, there is increasing scientific interest in further exploring the biological and metabolic effects of intermittent fasting periods, as well as whether long-term compliance may be improved by this type of dietary approach. This special will highlight the latest scientific findings related to the effects of both caloric restriction and intermittent fasting across various species including yeast, fruit flies, worms, rodents, primates, and humans.

A major obstacle to understanding how DR modulates lifespan and aging-related dysfunction is the multiplicity of physiological and molecular changes associated with DR. Unraveling their importance to the longevity effect of DR remains a major challenge. In this perspective, we review the marked genetic variation in the response to DR of multiple recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains. We illustrate how this genetic variation can be exploited to probe the mechanisms mediating lifespan extension by DR, as well as uncover its limits as an intervention. RI strains exhibit marked variation in their lifespan as well as physiological responses to DR. Quantitative genetic and statistical tools can use this phenotypic variation to probe the importance of physiological and molecular changes that have been hypothesized to play roles in DR-mediated lifespan extension.",

     "abstract": "Comparative studies indicate that long-lived mammals have low rates of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production (mtROSp) and oxidative damage in their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Dietary restriction (DR), around 40%, extends the mean and maximum life span of a wide range of species and lowers mtROSp and oxidative damage to mtDNA, which supports the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging (MFRTA). Regarding the dietary factor responsible for the life extension effect of DR, neither carbohydrate nor lipid restriction seems to modify maximum longevity. However protein restriction (PR) and methionine restriction (at least 80% MetR) increase maximum lifespan in rats and mice. Interestingly, only 7\u00a0weeks of 40% PR (at least in liver) or 40% MetR (in all the studied organs, heart, brain, liver or kidney) is enough to decrease mtROSp and oxidative damage to mtDNA in rats, whereas neither carbohydrate nor lipid restriction changes these parameters. In addition, old rats also conserve the capacity to respond to 7\u00a0weeks of 40% MetR with these beneficial changes. Most importantly, 40% MetR, differing from what happens during both 40% DR and 80% MetR, does not decrease growth rate and body size of rats. All the available studies suggest that the decrease in methionine ingestion that occurs during DR is responsible for part of the aging-delaying effect of this intervention likely through the decrease of mtROSp and ensuing DNA damage that it exerts. We conclude that lowering mtROS generation is a conserved mechanism, shared by long-lived species and dietary, protein, and methionine restricted animals, that decreases damage to macromolecules situated near the complex I mtROS generator, especially mtDNA. This would decrease the accumulation rate of somatic mutations in mtDNA and maybe finally also in nuclear DNA.",

The diverse efficacy of CR to counteract aging effects and its experimental reproducibility has made it the gold standard of many aging intervention studies of recent years. Although CR originally was used as a tool to perturb the aging process of laboratory animals as to uncover clues of underlying mechanisms of aging processes, current CR research interests have shifted to the retardation of aging-related functional decline and the prevention of age-related diseases. Advances in CR research on non-human primates and recent endeavors using human subjects offer a promising outlook for CR's beneficial effects in healthy human aging.In this review, several major issues related to CR's anti-aging mechanisms are discussed by highlighting the importance of modulating deleterious chronic inflammation at molecular levels and the impact of epigenetic chromatin and histone modifications by CR at the ultimate control sites of gene expression.

However, treatment approaches for obesity in older adults remain controversial due to concerns surrounding the difficulty of behavior change with advancing age, exacerbating the age-related loss of skeletal muscle and bone, and the feasibility of long-term weight maintenance and related health consequences. This review serves to systematically examine the evidence regarding weight loss interventions with a focus on obese (body mass index 30\u00a0kg/m2 and above) older adults (aged 65\u00a0years and older) and some proposed mechanisms associated with exercise and caloric restriction (lifestyle intervention). Our findings indicate that healthy weight loss in this age group can be achieved through lifestyle interventions of up to a one-year period. Most interventions reviewed reported a loss of lean body mass and bone mineral density with weight loss. Paradoxically muscle quality and physical function improved. Inflammatory molecules and metabolic markers also improved, although the independent and additive effects of exercise and weight loss on these pathways are poorly understood. Using our review inclusion criteria, only one small pilot study investigating long-term weight maintenance and associated health implications was found in the literature. Future research on lifestyle interventions for obese older adults should address the loss of bone and lean body mass, inflammatory mechanisms, and include sufficient follow-up to assess long-term weight maintenance and health outcomes.",

Both preclinical and some clinical studies have provided evidence that food restriction may increase reward sensitivity, and while there are mixed findings regarding the effects of overeating on reward sensitivity, there is strong evidence linking this behavior with changes in reward-related brain regions. Evidence of these changes comes in part from findings that show that such eating patterns are associated with increased drug use. The data discussed here regarding the differential effects of various eating patterns on reward systems may be particularly relevant to the aging population, as this population has been shown to exhibit altered reward sensitivity and decreased caloric consumption. Moreover, members of this population appear to be increasingly affected by the current obesity epidemic. Food, like alcohol or drugs, can stimulate its own consumption and produce similar neurochemical changes in the brain. Age-related loss of appetite, decreased eating, and caloric restriction are hypothesized to be associated with changes in the prevalence of substance misuse, abuse, and dependence seen in this cohort.",

The present paper gives a brief outline of the basic disease processes that underlie metabolic pro-inflammation, including how one might go about devising the most potent and practical detoxification from such metabolic compromise. The role that dietary restriction plays in pro-inflammatory detoxification (detox), including how a modified fast (selective food abstinence) is incorporated into this process, is developed. The unique aspects of geriatric bariatric medicine are elucidated, including the concepts of sarcopenia and the obesity paradox. Important caveats involving the senior seeking weight loss are offered. By the end of the paper, the reader will have a greater appreciation for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for geriatric patients who wish to overcome food addiction and reverse pro-inflammatory states of ill-heath. This includes the toxic metabolic processes that create obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which collectively we call diabesity. In that regard, diabesity is often the central pathology that leads to the evolution of the metabolic syndrome. The paper also affords the reader a solid review of the neurometabolic processes that effectuate anorexigenic versus orexigenic inputs to obesity that drive food addiction. We argue that these processes lead to either weight gain or weight loss by a tripartite system involving metabolic, addictive and relational levels of organismal functioning. Recalibrating the way we negotiate these three levels of daily functioning often determines success or failure in terms of overcoming metabolic syndrome and food addiction.",

Furthermore, an increase in PGC-1\u03b1 protein and markers of mitochondrial content with CR is a highly variable observation between studies. On the other hand, deacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins by the sirtuin, Sirt3, is an increasingly reported observation and at least so far, this observation is consistent between studies. Notwithstanding this point, the controversies evident in the published literature underscore the significant questions that remain in our understanding of how CR impacts the mitochondrion and suggest we have yet to fully understand the complexities herein.",

     "abstract": "Reducing calorie intake extends the lifespan of a variety of experimental models and delays progression of age-related hearing loss (AHL). AHL is a common feature of aging and is characterized by age-related decline of hearing associated with loss of sensory hair cells, spiral ganglion neurons, and/or stria vascularis degeneration in the cochlea. Sirtuins are a family of NAD+-dependent enzymes that regulate lifespan in lower organisms and have emerged as broad regulators of cellular fate. Our recent study indicated that mitochondrial Sirt3, a member of the sirtuin family, mediates the anti-aging effects of calorie restriction (CR) on AHL in mice. Interestingly, we also found that weight loss alone may not be sufficient for maintaining normal hearing. How does CR slow the progression of AHL through regulation of Sirt3? Here we review the evidence that during CR, Sirt3 slows the progression of AHL by promoting the glutathione-mediated mitochondrial antioxidant defense system in mice. A significant reduction in food consumption in one's daily life may not be a desirable and realistic option for most people. Therefore, identification/discovery of compounds that induce the activation of SIRT3 or glutathione reductase, or that increase mitochondrial glutathione levels has potential for maintaining good hearing through mimicking the anti-aging effects of CR in human inner ear cells.",

Measures of muscle pain, resting elbow extension, upper arm girth, isometric strength, myoglobin (Mb), total nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 1beta (IL1b), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) were collected before and after eccentric contractions of the non-dominant elbow flexors were completed. The fasting group's loss of elbow extension was less than the post-prandial group ( p <\u00a0.05, eta2\u00a0=\u00a0.10), but the groups did not change differently across time for any other outcome measures.

Here we examine the requirements for autophagy during extension of chronological life span (CLS) by calorie restriction (CR). We find that autophagy is upregulated by two CR interventions that extend CLS: water wash CR and low glucose CR. Autophagy is required for full extension of CLS during water wash CR under all growth conditions tested. In contrast, autophagy was not uniformly required for full extension of CLS during low glucose CR, depending on the atg allele and strain genetic background. Leucine status influenced CLS during CR. Eliminating the leucine requirement in yeast strains or adding supplemental leucine to growth media extended CLS during CR. In addition, we observed that both water wash and low glucose CR promote mitochondrial respiration proficiency during aging of autophagy-deficient yeast. In general, the extension of CLS by water wash or low glucose CR was inversely related to respiration deficiency in autophagy-deficient cells. Also, autophagy is required for full extension of CLS under non-CR conditions in buffered media, suggesting that extension of CLS during CR is not solely due to reduced medium acidity. Thus, our findings show that autophagy is: (1) induced by CR, (2) required for full extension of CLS by CR in most cases (depending on atg allele, strain, and leucine availability) and, (3) promotes mitochondrial respiration proficiency during aging under CR conditions.",

     "abstract": "Short-term starvation (STS) protects normal cells while simultaneously sensitizing malignant cells to high-dose chemotherapeutic drugs in mice and possibly patients. The fasting-dependent protection of normal cells and sensitization of malignant cells depends, in part, on reduced levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and glucose. Calorie restricted diets with defined macronutrient (carbohydrate, protein, fat) ratios were evaluated for the effects on stress sensitization markers and protection in mice treated with high-dose chemotherapy. We show that short-term CR significantly reduced both glucose and IGF-1 levels, but when specific macronutrient deficiencies were tested, only the complete lack of proteins reduced IGF-1 levels. Short-term 50% CR combined with either severe protein-deficiency or ketogenic diets improved chemotoxicity resistance similarly to the standard 50% CR, but did not result in the high protection caused by STS. Notably, a high protein diet reversed the beneficial effects of short-term CR. In a subcutaneous mouse model of glioma, feeding a low protein (4% calories from protein) diet for more than 20\u00a0days did not delay tumor progression once the tumor became palpable. Also, cycles of short-term (3\u00a0days) 50% CR did not augment the chemotherapy efficacy of cisplatin in a murine breast cancer model. These results indicate that the protection from chemotoxicity and retardation of the progression of certain tumors achieved with fasting is not obtained with short-term calorie and/or macronutrient restriction.",

To elucidate the third factor in relation to aging and lifespan, we employed the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which can provide an ideal system for analyzing the mathematical and biophysical models. An amplification of ATP noise was clearly evident from around the onset of biodemographic aging (t0) as if the t0 was synchronized with or derived from the amplification of noise. Furthermore, the expression noise of the unc-54 gene, which encodes the myosin heavy chain, increased from around the t0. In contrast, the noise of genes related to the mitochondrial respiratory chain was almost constant with aging. There is a high energy barrier between life and death. Here we propose that the transition from living to dying may be facilitated by noise amplification. The finite value (or non-zero) of t0 is essential to the lifespan equation derived from the diffusion model.",

     "abstract": "Aging is associated with a loss in muscle known as sarcopenia that is partially attributed to apoptosis. In aging rodents, caloric restriction (CR) increases health and longevity by improving mitochondrial function and the polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) has been reported to have similar benefits. In the present study, we investigated the potential efficacy of using short-term (6\u00a0weeks) CR (20%), RSV (50\u00a0mg/kg/day), or combined CR\u00a0+\u00a0RSV (20% CR and 50\u00a0mg/kg/day RSV), initiated at late-life (27\u00a0months) to protect muscle against sarcopenia by altering mitochondrial function, biogenesis, content, and apoptotic signaling in both glycolytic white and oxidative red gastrocnemius muscle (WG and RG, respectively) of male Fischer 344\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Brown Norway rats. CR but not RSV attenuated the age-associated loss of muscle mass in both mixed gastrocnemius and soleus muscle, while combined treatment (CR\u00a0+\u00a0RSV) paradigms showed a protective effect in the soleus and plantaris muscle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Sirt1 protein content was increased by 2.6-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in WG but not RG muscle with RSV treatment, while CR or CR\u00a0+\u00a0RSV had no effect. PGC-1\u03b1 levels were higher (2-fold) in the WG from CR-treated animals (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) when compared to ad-libitum (AL) animals but no differences were observed in the RG with any treatment. Levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were significantly higher (1.6-fold) in the WG muscle of RSV and CR\u00a0+\u00a0RSV groups compared to AL (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but tended to occur coincident with elevations in the pro-apoptotic protein Bax so that the apoptotic susceptibility as indicated by the Bax to Bcl-2 ratio was unchanged. There were no alterations in DNA fragmentation with any treatment in muscle from older animals. Additionally, mitochondrial respiration measured in permeabilized muscle fibers was unchanged in any treatment group and this paralleled the lack of change in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity. These data suggest that short-term moderate CR, RSV, or CR\u00a0+\u00a0RSV tended to modestly alter key mitochondrial regulatory and apoptotic signaling pathways in glycolytic muscle and this might contribute to the moderate protective effects against aging-induced muscle loss observed in this study.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation have been implicated in the testicular aging process. Different types and moderate-intensity of regular exercise may reduce age-related physiological dysfunction associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, but such effects of moderate-intensity of exercise over different phases of life in testes have not been reported. In this study, male SAMP8 mice, a senescence-accelerated strain, were maintained as sedentary (sed) or subjected to daily 15-min periods of swimming exercise between ages of 2\u20137\u00a0months (lifelong), 2\u20134\u00a0months (earlier) or 5\u20137\u00a0months (late). Age-related changes, including serum testosterone levels and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress were analyzed at the end of the experiment. All exercise groups showed significantly greater serum testosterone levels and decreased age-related inflammation and oxidative stress compared with the sedentary group. Exercise also increased expression and activity of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), a transcriptional regulator of the cellular anti-oxidant system, and decreased expression and activity of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03baB), a mediator of inflammatory molecules, in the nucleus of testicular cells. However, lifelong and earlier groups generally showed significantly better protective effects than the late group against age-related physiological dysfunction in testes. Thus, lifelong exercise and earlier phase exercise were most effective in counteracting oxidative stress and inflammation and in preserving testes function through regulation of Nrf2 and NF-\u03baB. These results advocate the benefits of lifelong exercise and emphasize a greater protection against male aging by instituting exercise earlier rather than late in life.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia, defined as muscle weakness and fiber atrophy, of respiratory muscles such as the diaphragm (DIAm) has not been well characterized. The DIAm is the main inspiratory muscle and knowledge of DIAm sarcopenia is important for establishing the effects of aging on respiratory function. We hypothesized that aging is associated with a loss of DIAm force and reduced fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), and that these changes vary across fiber types. DIAm sarcopenia was assessed in young (5\u00a0month; n\u00a0=\u00a011) and old (23\u00a0month; n\u00a0=\u00a012) wild-type mice reflecting ~\u00a0100 and 75% survival, respectively. In addition, DIAm sarcopenia was evaluated in BubR1H/H mice (n\u00a0=\u00a04) that display accelerated aging (~\u00a060% survival at 5\u00a0months) as a result of expression of a hypomorphic allele (H) of the mitotic checkpoint protein BubR1. Maximum specific force (normalized for CSA) of the DIAm was 34% less in old mice and 57% lower in BubR1H/H mice compared to young mice. Mean CSA of type IIx and/or IIb DIAm fibers was 27% smaller in old wild-type mice and 47% smaller in BubR1H/H mice compared to young mice. Mean CSA of type I or IIa fibers was not different between groups. Collectively these results demonstrate sarcopenia of the DIAm in aging wild-type mice and in BubR1H/H mice displaying accelerated aging. Sarcopenia may limit the ability of the DIAm to accomplish expulsive, non-ventilatory behaviors essential for airway clearance. As a result, these changes in the DIAm may contribute to respiratory complications with aging.",

     "abstract": "Loss of muscle and bone mass with age are significant contributors to falls and fractures among the elderly. Myostatin deficiency is associated with increased muscle mass in mice, dogs, cows, sheep and humans, and mice lacking myostatin have been observed to show increased bone density in the limb, spine, and jaw. Transgenic overexpression of myostatin propeptide, which binds to and inhibits the active myostatin ligand, also increases muscle mass and bone density in mice. We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that in vivo inhibition of myostatin using an injectable myostatin propeptide (GDF8 propeptide-Fc) would increase both muscle mass and bone density in aged (24 mo) mice. Male mice were injected weekly (20\u00a0mg/kg body weight) with recombinant myostatin propeptide-Fc (PRO) or vehicle (VEH; saline) for four weeks. There was no difference in body weight between the two groups at the end of the treatment period, but PRO treatment significantly increased mass of the tibialis anterior muscle (+\u00a07%) and increased muscle fiber diameter of the extensor digitorum longus (+\u00a016%) and soleus (+\u00a06%) muscles compared to VEH treatment. Bone volume relative to total volume (BV/TV) of the femur calculated by microCT did not differ significantly between PRO- and VEH-treated mice, and ultimate force (Fu), stiffness (S), toughness (U) measured from three-point bending tests also did not differ significantly between groups. Histomorphometric assays also revealed no differences in bone formation or resorption in response to PRO treatment. These data suggest that while developmental perturbation of myostatin signaling through either gene knockout or transgenic inhibition may alter both muscle and bone mass in mice, pharmacological inhibition of myostatin in aged mice has a more pronounced effect on skeletal muscle than on bone.",

Every other day feeding (EOD) has been utilized in aging research and shown to mimic many of the positive outcomes consequent with dietary restriction. This study employed long living Ames dwarf mice subjected to EOD feeding to examine the adaptations of the oxidative phosphorylation and antioxidative defense systems to this feeding regimen. Every other day feeding lowered liver glutathione (GSH) concentrations in dwarf and wild type (WT) mice but altered GSH biosynthesis and degradation in WT mice only. The activities of liver OXPHOS enzymes and corresponding proteins declined in WT mice fed EOD while in dwarf animals, the levels were maintained or increased with this feeding regimen. Antioxidative enzymes were differentially affected depending on the tissue, whether proliferative or post-mitotic. Gene expression of components of liver methionine metabolism remained elevated in dwarf mice when compared to WT mice as previously reported however, enzymes responsible for recycling homocysteine to methionine were elevated in both genotypes in response to EOD feeding. The data suggest that the differences in anabolic hormone levels likely affect the sensitivity of long living and control mice to this dietary regimen, with dwarf mice exhibiting fewer responses in comparison to WT mice. These results provide further evidence that dwarf mice may be better protected against metabolic and environmental perturbations which may in turn, contribute to their extended longevity.",

     "abstract": "The interrelationship between muscle strength, motor unit (MU) number, and age is poorly understood, and in this study we sought to determine whether age-related differences in muscle strength are moderated by estimates of functioning MU number and size. Eighteen older adults (OA; 67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.20\u00a0years) and 24 young adults (YA; 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74\u00a0years) participated in this study. Maximum voluntary pinch\u2013grip strength of the nondominant hand was determined and estimates of MU number were obtained from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle using the noninvasive motor unit number index (MUNIX) technique. The MUNIX technique was also utilized to derive a motor unit size index (MUSIX). An analysis of covariance (Age Group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0MUNIX or MUSIX) was used to test heterogeneity of regression slopes, with body mass and gender serving as covariates. We observed that the slope of pinch\u2013grip strength on the estimated number of MUs between YA and OA differed, indicated by an Age Group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0MUNIX interaction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Specifically, after controlling for the effect of body mass and gender, the slope in OA was significantly positive (0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0N/MUs, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), whereas no such relationship was found in YA (\u2212\u00a00.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0N/MUs, p\u00a0=\u00a00.35). A significant Age Group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0MUSIX interaction was also observed for strength (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In contrast to MUNIX, the slope in younger adults was significantly positive (0.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0N/\u03bcV, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), whereas no such relationship was found in older adults (\u2212\u00a00.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0N/\u03bcV, p\u00a0=\u00a00.18). These findings indicate that there is an interrelationship between muscle strength, MU numbers, and aging, which suggests that a portion of muscle weakness in seniors may be attributable to the loss of functioning motor units.",

Fractal dimension as an indicator of cellular complexity, and lacunarity as indicator of tissue heterogeneity were determined based on the binarized SHT micrographs. Results indicate that fractal dimension of mice spleen hematopoietic tissue decreases with age, while lacunarity increases. These changes/trends have been detected in SHT stained both with toluidine blue and conventional hematoxylin/eosin. Fractal dimension was negatively correlated with lacunarity.

Treatments were consumed twice per day for 12 weeks. At pre- and post-supplementation period, participants performed a discontinuous, submaximal cycle ergometry test to determine physical working capacity at fatigue threshold (PWCFT). Fat mass, total body and arm lean soft tissue mass (ALSTM) were measured with DEXA while muscle strength was assessed with handgrip dynamometry (GRIP) and 30-s sit-to-stand (STS) was used to measure lower body functionality. Muscle quality (MQ) was calculated with GRIPmax and DEXA derived ALSTM [GRIP (kg)\u00b7ALSTM (kg)\u2212\u00a01]. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare pre- to post-supplementation measures and group differences. There were 16 dropouts over the duration of the study. Final group sizes were ONS\u00a0=\u00a016 (m\u00a0=\u00a011, w\u00a0=\u00a05), ONS800\u00a0=\u00a015 (m\u00a0=\u00a05, w\u00a0=\u00a010), and ONS1200\u00a0=\u00a013 (m\u00a0=\u00a06, w\u00a0=\u00a07). No significant changes were observed for body composition or GRIP values pre to post. Significant increases in PWCFT were seen in ONS1200 (13.6%) and ONS800 (17.8%) pre- to post-supplementation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These changes were significantly greater (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than the changes in ONS (\u2212\u00a06.3%). ONS1200 and ONS had significant increases in STS (22.2 and 10.7%, respectively). While ONS significantly increased in STS, no differences (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) in change scores were found between ONS and ONS800. ONS fortified with beta-alanine may improve physical working capacity, muscle quality and function in older men and women.

Mitochondrial dysfunction in aging is believed to cause these functional and phenotypic changes in the heart. Although precise understanding of alterations of mitochondrial respiration in aging is necessary to manage heart diseases in the elderly population conflicting data on the function of specific complex of electron transport chain of the heart mitochondria limits the intervention process. We have addressed these issues using the assay of mitochondrial coupling and electron flow to assess specific functional defects in mitochondria isolated from young or aged mice. Our results demonstrate that cardiac mitochondria from older mice utilize oxygen at a decreased rate via complex I, II or IV compared to younger mice. We further show that mitochondrial function decreases in young Sod2+/\u2212 mice heart compared to young wildtype mice. However, the mitochondrial function remains unchanged in older Sod2+/\u2212 mice heart compared to younger Sod2+/\u2212 mice heart. Further, the oxygen consumption remains similar in old wildtype mice and old Sod2+/\u2212 mice heart mitochondria. The expression and activity of Sod2 in young or old Sod2+/\u2212 mice heart remain unchanged. These data demonstrate that decreased oxygen utilization in older age could have resulted in decreased mitochondrial ROS-mediated oxidative damage requiring less Sod2 for protection against mitochondrial oxidative stress in older wildtype or older Sod2+/\u2212 mice.",

     "abstract": "Reduced diet or reduced reproduction each extends lifespan in many animals. It is often thought that reduced reproduction and reduced diet may act through the same mechanisms. In grasshoppers, ovariectomy extends lifespan and reduces feeding to a level similar to that used for life extension by dietary restriction, further suggesting mechanistic overlap. Here, we measure the feeding rate of ovariectomized grasshoppers and, by manipulating feeding levels, create a sham-operated & dietary restricted group with matched daily feeding. Both groups show ~\u00a025% increased survivorship near the median age of mortality for fully fed and reproductive controls. Ovariectomy results in a doubling of fat body mass and hemolymph volume in comparison to both a feeding-matched dietary restriction group and a sham-operated & fully fed control, which do not differ from each other. Total anti-oxidant activity in the hemolymph and the skeletal muscle was unchanged upon ovariectomy or dietary restriction, so it does not appear to be a major factor in lifespan extension. Next, we measured mitochondrial counts using qPCR to determine mitochondrial cytochrome-b concentrations relative to nuclear (genomic) beta-actin. Mitochondrial counts in the ovariectomized group were lower than sham-operated and fully fed controls but not than the dietary restriction group. Last, in the fat body, transcript levels of hexamerin-90 (a hemolymph storage protein) were affected by neither ovariectomy nor dietary restriction. Hence, ovariectomy resulted in large magnitude increases in organismal storage. The matched-fed dietary restricted group differed from the ovariectomized group only in organismal storage, and not in any of the cellular parameters measured here. This study suggests that longevity via ovariectomy has distinct physiological mechanisms from longevity via dietary restriction in grasshoppers that are independent of daily feeding rate, particularly for protein and fat storage.",

     "abstract": "Loss of myonuclei by apoptosis is thought to contribute to sarcopenia. We have previously shown, that the leucine metabolite, \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) suppresses apoptotic signaling and the apoptotic index (the ratio of apoptotic positive to apoptotic negative myonuclei) during muscle disuse and during reloading periods after disuse in aged rats. However, it was not clear if the apoptotic signaling indexes were due only to preservation of myonuclei or if perhaps the total myogenic pool increased as a result of HMB-mediated satellite cell proliferation as this would have also reduced the apoptotic index. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HMB would augment myogenic cells (satellite cells) proliferation during muscle recovery (growth) after a period of disuse in senescent animals. The hindlimb muscles of 34\u00a0month old Fisher 344\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Brown Norway rats were unloaded for 14\u00a0days by hindlimb suspension (HLS), and then reloaded for 14\u00a0days. The rats received either Ca-HMB (340\u00a0mg/kg body weight; n\u00a0=\u00a016), or the vehicle (n\u00a0=\u00a010) by gavage throughout the experimental period. HMB prevented the functional decline in maximal plantar flexion isometric force production during the reloading period, but not during HLS. HMB-treatment enhanced the proliferation of muscle stem cells as shown by a greater percentage of satellite cells that had proliferated (more BrdU positive, Pax-7 positive, and more Pax7/Ki67 positive nuclei) and as a result, more differentiated stem cells were present (more MyoD/myogenin positive myonuclei), relative to total myonuclei, in reloaded plantaris muscles as compared to reloaded muscles from vehicle-treated animals. Furthermore HMB increased the nuclear protein abundance of proliferation markers, inhibitor of differentiation-2 and cyclin A, as compared to vehicle treatment in reloaded muscles. Although HMB increased phosphorylated Akt during reloading, other mTOR related proteins were not altered by HMB treatment. These data show that HMB improved the proliferation of muscle stem cells in fast twitch plantaris muscles. Enhanced satellite cell proliferation leading to increased differentiated myonuclei should increase the transcriptional potential to support muscle hypertrophic changes and functional changes in sarcopenic muscles, and this could partly explain the reduced apoptotic index in HMB treated muscles. Indeed, muscle mass and fiber cross-sectional area were significantly greater in plantaris muscles from HMB-treated animal muscles after reloading as compared to vehicle-treated animals.",

     "abstract": "Since dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) cannot distinguish between different adipose tissue (AT) deposits, it remains unclear how DXA-derived body composition variables relate to anatomical tissue (sub)compartments. The aim of the present study was to compare and relate regional DXA variables with absolute tissue masses obtained by computer tomography (CT) scanning of the lower limbs in elderly persons.Eleven well-preserved white Caucasian adults (seven male and four female cadavers) with a median age of 79.0\u00a0years (ranging from 68 to 96\u00a0years) were fully scanned with DXA and CT. Separate densities of skin tissue, AT, muscle tissue and bone were obtained by hydrostatic weighing.The leg DXA-variables were significantly related (rho-values between 0.60 and 0.98, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) to CT-derived tissue counterparts, but showed significant systematic differences except for subcutaneous AT mass (P\u00a0=\u00a00.773). After controlling for other AT depots, fat as measured by DXA (fatDXA) related only to intermuscular AT (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.82, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in males and to subcutaneous AT (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.84, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in females.Although significantly interrelated, DXA and CT variables should not be used interchangeably since they have different quantitative and physiological significance. Our results suggest that fatDXA represents different parts of AT depots in elderly men and women. Since DXA is not appropriate for assessing tissue variability cautious clinical interpretation is warranted.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a key factor in the aging process and in the development of age-related diseases. Because nutritional interventions such as caloric restriction (CR) delay the onset of age-related diseases and increase the lifespan of many species, the impact of a moderate CR was tested on male grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), which have a median survival time of 5.7\u00a0years in captivity. The effects of CR on these lemurs were compared with a potential mimetic, resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol naturally found in grapes. We hypothesized that both CR and RSV impact oxidative DNA and RNA damage compared to standard-fed control (CTL) animals. Adult (3\u20134\u00a0years old) male mouse lemurs were assigned to three dietary groups: a CTL group, a CR group receiving 30% fewer calories than the CTL and a RSV group receiving the CTL diet supplemented with RSV (200\u00a0mg\u00b7day\u2212\u00a01\u00b7kg\u2212\u00a01). Oxidative stress was estimated after 3, 9, 15 and 21\u00a0months of treatment using the measurement of oxidized nucleosides in urine samples by mass spectrometry. The resting metabolic rate, adjusted for changes in body composition, was also measured to assess the potential relationship between oxygen consumption and oxidative damage markers. This study provides evidence for oxidative stress accumulation with age in grey mouse lemur. Dietary interventions resulted in a short-term increase in oxidative stress levels followed by reduced levels with increasing age. Moreover, in this photoperiod-dependent heterotherm primate, seasonal variations in oxidative stress were observed, which was likely due to a season-dependent, cost\u2013benefit trade-off between torpor use and oxidative stress.",

Fatty liver disease (FLD) was identified with ultrasound imaging. The risk factors measured were body mass index (BMI), and plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and serum uric acid (SUA). The probability of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis was predicted using a score based on BMI, age, ALT, and TG (BAAT),and using AST/ALT ratio (AAR).FLD was higher in the elderly (26.7%) than in the non-elderly (22.8%) and similar in the elderly between men and women (26.6% vs 27.0%, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). BMI, TC, TG, LDL, SUA, AST and ALT were all significantly higher in FLD, whereas the level of HDL was markedly lower. Multiple regression analyses showed that obesity, high TC, TG, SUA, low HDL, and elevated ALT, AAR\u00a0<\u00a01 were closely related to the elderly FLD, while male sex, obesity, high TC, TG, low HDL, elevated ALT, AST and AAR\u00a0<\u00a01 were closely related to the non-elderly FLD. The prevalence of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis estimated as BAAT index\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 was 2.4% in all subjects, and was higher in the elderly FLD patients than in the non-elderly FLD patients.The prevalence of FLD is higher in the elderly, and is broadly related to the same metabolic risk factors as in the non-elderly.

The LV group performed one-set of each exercise, while the HV group performed three-sets of each exercise, twice weekly for 13\u00a0weeks.

However, effects of altered Th1/Th2 commitment on lung senescence are largely unknown. To examine effects of altered Th1/Th2 balance on lung aging, we measured proportions of Th1 and Th2 cells and expression of cytokines, chemokines, collagen deposition and other relevant physiological and pathological parameters in 2- and 20-months-old (mo) CXCR3-deficient (CXCR3\u2212/\u2212) C57BL/6J mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. There was a significant weight-loss observed in 20-mo CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with the same aged WT group. Although lung function and structure changed with age in both groups, central airway resistance (Rn), tissue elastance (H) and damping (G) were significantly lower in 20-mo CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice than those of WT mice. In contrast, the whole lung volume (VL), the mean linear intercept length of alveolar (Lm), and the total lung collagen content were significantly elevated in 20-mo CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice. With aging, the lungs of WT mice had typical Th1-type status (increased population of Th1 cells and concentrations of cytokine IFN-\u03b3 and CXCR3 ligands) while CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice showed Th2-type polarization (decreased proportion of Th1 cells and concentrations of CXCR3 ligands but increased level of IL-4). Our data suggest that Immunosenescence is associated with lung aging, and that altered Th1/Th2 imbalance favors Th2 predominance in CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice, which contributes to the process of accelerated lung aging in this model.",

Both exercise training programs were moderate-to-vigorous intensity, three days/week for 9-months. Strength, aerobic endurance, body fat and blood pressure were measured on five different occasions. The data were analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA, and the independence between systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and group was tested.

The repeated eccentric exercise model was applied to produce long-lasting and extensive changes in redox biomarkers and to reveal more effectively the potential effects of aging on redox homeostasis. Ten young (20.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0years) and ten elderly men (64.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0years) underwent an isokinetic eccentric exercise session, which was repeated after three weeks. Muscle function/damage indices (torque, range of movement, muscle soreness and creatine kinase) and redox biomarkers (F2-isoprostanes, protein carbonyls, glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, uric acid, bilirubin and albumin) were assessed in plasma, erythrocytes or urine pre-exercise, immediately post-exercise and at 2 and 4\u00a0days post-exercise. As expected, the elderly group exhibited oxidative stress in baseline compared to the young group. Extensive muscle damage and extensive alterations in redox homeostasis appeared after the first bout of eccentric exercise. Noteworthy, the redox responses were similar between the age groups despite their differences in baseline values. Likewise, both age groups demonstrated blunted alterations in muscle damage and redox homeostasis after the second bout of eccentric exercise indicating adaptations from the first bout of exercise. Elderly individuals seem to be well fitted to participate in demanding physical activities without suffering detrimental effects on skeletal muscle and/or disturbances on redox homeostasis. The repeated eccentric exercise model may be a useful and practical physiological tool to study redox biology in humans.",

     "abstract": "Renal dysfunction is closely associated with endothelial damage leading to cardiovascular disease. However, the extent to which endothelial damage induced by uremia is modulated by aging is poorly known. Aging can render endothelial cells more susceptible to apoptosis through an oxidative stress-dependent pathway. We examined whether senescence-associated to oxidative stress determines the injury induced by the uremia in endothelial cells.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was incubated with human uremic serum and, in the animal model, endothelial cells were obtained from aortas of uremic and no uremic rats. Vitamin C was used to prevent oxidative stress. Senescence, assessed by telomere length and enzyme-betagalactosidase (\u03b2-gal), reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1 probe), caspase 3, and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. NF-\u03baB activity was determined by Western blot.Uremic serum increased ROS and NF-\u03baB in young and aging HUVEC. However only in aging cells, uremic serum induced apoptosis (vs young HUVEC, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The endothelial damage induced by uremia seems to be related with the increased oxidative stress, since in both HUVEC and in the experimental model of renal disease in rats, vitamin C prevents endothelial apoptosis. However, vitamin C did not decrease the oxidative stress associated to senescence.

In addition, the serum testosterone levels decrease quickly in the natural growth process of this model. This study investigated the effect of androgen deficiency on the synaptic plasticity of hippocampus in male SAMP8 mice after castration and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) administration. We observed the dendritic spines and synapses using Golgi staining and transmission electron microscope. Androgen deficiency after castration significantly reduced the number of apical dendritic thorns, and the abnormal ultrastructure of excitatory synapses was more obvious. Androgen replacement therapy reversed this change. To explore the protective mechanisms and neurological basis of DHT, we researched the changes of expression of GluN1 subunit-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and synaptophysin (SYN), which are closely related to synaptic plasticity. Comparisons were made among results observed with immunohistochemistry techniques, Western blots analysis and RT-PCR analysis. The GluN1 and SYN regulation at the protein and mRNA levels probably be related to the DHT-induced morphological synaptic plasticity. This study will be helpful for understanding the function of androgen, and it provides a valuable theoretical basis about the protective and therapeutic targets of androgen in AD.",

Invasive injection of exogenous neurotrophins into hippocampus reverses spatial memory deficits, but its clinical application is limited by traumatic brain injury during the injection procedure. Notably, recent studies have demonstrated that noninvasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) increases endogenous neurotrophins contents in the brain of normal rats. Whether low-frequency rTMS can reverse A\u03b21\u201342-mediated decrease in hippocampal neurotrophins contents and spatial memory impairment is still unclear. Here, we reported that severe deficit in long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory were observed in an A\u03b21\u201342-induced toxicity rat model. Furthermore, neurotrophins (NGF and BDNF) and NMDA-receptor levels were decreased after A\u03b2 injection. However, low-frequency rTMS markedly reversed the decrease in neurotrophins contents. And the rTMS-induced increment of neurotrophins up-regulated hippocampal NMDA-receptor expression. Moreover, low-frequency rTMS rescued deficits in LTP and spatial memory of rats with A\u03b2-injection. These results indicate that low-frequency rTMS noninvasively and effectively increases hippocampal neurotrophins and NMDA-receptor contents in A\u03b21\u201342-induced toxicity model rats, which helps to enhance hippocampal LTP and reverses A\u03b21\u201342-mediated memory deficits.",

     "abstract": "The mortality patterns in human populations reflect biological, social and medical factors affecting our lives, and mathematical modelling is an important tool for the analysis of these patterns. It is known that the mortality rate in all human populations increases with age after sexual maturity. This increase is predominantly exponential and satisfies the Gompertz equation. Although the exponential growth of mortality rates is observed over a wide range of ages, it excludes early- and late-life intervals. In this work we accept the fact that the mortality rate is an exponential function of age and analyse possible mechanisms underlying the deviations from the exponential law across the human lifespan. We consider the effect of heterogeneity as well as stochastic factors in altering the exponential law and compare our results to publicly available age-dependent mortality data for Swedish and US populations. In a model of heterogeneous populations we study how differences in parameters of the Gompertz equation describing different subpopulations account for mortality dynamics at different ages. Particularly, we show that the mortality data on Swedish populations can be reproduced fairly well by a model comprising four subpopulations. We then analyse the influence of stochastic effects on the mortality dynamics to show that they play a role only at early and late ages, when only a few individuals contribute to mortality. We conclude that the deviations from exponential law at young ages can be explained by heterogeneity, namely by the presence of a subpopulation with high initial mortality rate presumably due to congenital defects, while those for old ages can be viewed as fluctuations and explained by stochastic effects.",

Recent data highlighted aspirin as an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, however, it's unclear whether it affects cardiac proteasome functions.

Parallel experiments were performed in the hypoxia/reoxygenated human ventricular myocytes. Dose-related increases in heart and ventricular weight, and impaired cardiac functions, were found more exacerbated in the aspirin-treated MI rat hearts than the saline-treated MI counterparts. The activity of 26S, 20S and 19S declined by about 30%, or the 20S proteasome subunits \u03b25, \u03b22 and \u03b21 decreased by 40%, 20% and 30%, respectively, in the MI rats compared with the non-MI rats (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The cholinergic system modulates long-term potentiation and, therefore, memory processing. This study evaluated the spatial memory, the synaptic plasticity and the density of cholinergic markers in the hippocampi of mice submitted to cognitive stimulation during lifetime or during their aged phase. Male C57Bl/6 mice (2\u00a0months old) were exposed to enriched environment during 15\u00a0months (EE-15). An age-matched group was left in standard cages during the same period (SC-15). Spatial memory was evaluated using the Barnes maze at 2, 5, 11 and 17\u00a0months of age. At the 17-month-old time point, EE-15 mice showed better performance in the spatial memory task (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), when compared to C-15 mice. Other two groups of mice were left in regular cages until the age of 15\u00a0months, and then one of the groups was transferred to an enriched environment for two months (EE-2). The other group was kept in regular cages (C-2). After two months of stimulation, EE-2 showed a significant increase in spatial memory (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). At the end, brains were extracted and kept at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C. Slices were obtained from one hemisphere in a cryostat (20\u00a0\u03bcm, \u2212\u00a018\u00a0\u00b0C) and thaw-mounted on gelatin coated slides. Synaptic densities, cellular bodies, BDNF densities and \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChR) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Autoradiography for \u03b17 nAChR was conducted using [125I]-\u03b1-bungarotoxin. The other half of the brains was used for Western blotting analysis of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) density. There was no difference in synaptophysin or MAP-2 densities, but BDNF was increased in some hippocampal areas of EE-15 and EE-2, in comparison to control groups. In the same way, increases in ChAT and \u03b17 densities, but not in \u03b14\u03b22, were observed. Both cognitive stimuli during lifetime or during the aged phase improved spatial memory of mice. No difference in structural plasticity was observed, but the maintenance of memory can be due to improvement in long-term potentiation functionality in the hippocampus, modulated, at least, by BDNF and the cholinergic system.",

     "abstract": "It is now widely recognized that in order to optimize bone health in the later years, bone healthy behaviors should begin at a young age and continue throughout life. Prescribed orally to lower lipid levels in adults of all ages, statins have also been shown to stimulate bone formation in vitro by promoting bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) activity and to stimulate bone formation in vivo. Weight bearing exercise is well known to stimulate bone formation through a mechanism whereby mechanical loading is \u2018sensed\u2019 by the mechano-sensors leading to a cascade of events involving the activation of osteoblasts. For individuals with high cholesterol levels, both of these interventions are recommended throughout adult life. Since statins and exercise stimulate bone formation via different mechanisms, we hypothesized that exercise in combination with oral simvastatin synergistically increases bone mineral density and strength. Mature adult female, Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: control (n\u00a0=\u00a09), statin only (n\u00a0=\u00a08), exercise only (n\u00a0=\u00a011), and statin plus exercise (n\u00a0=\u00a011). Simvastatin was given to the two groups at a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg/day in standard rat chow for the entire 5\u00a0week period. All rats ate the same mass of food. The two exercise groups ran on a treadmill with progressively greater speeds and time, ending on week 5 at 30\u00a0m/min for 60\u00a0min. After 5\u00a0weeks, rats were euthanized, and excised femurs were scanned for areal bone mineral density (BMD) and tested by three point bending to obtain the following performance measures: maximum force (strength), stiffness, and work-to-fracture. Only the group treated with statins and exercise showed a positive effect on the biomechanical performance of the femurs. Compared to controls, this group had increased maximum force, stiffness, moment of inertia, and BMD. Linear regression analysis revealed that the increased performance was related to increased BMD. We conclude that the combination of oral statins and appropriate exercise increases bone strength better than either individual treatment and may provide optimal protection against osteoporosis.",

A major decrease in total number of cardiac spinal afferent neurons occurs in senescence.

     "abstract": "DNA methylation patterns change as individuals grow older, and DNA methylation appears susceptible to modification by the diet. Thus DNA methylation may be a mechanism through which diet can affect aging and longevity. We propose that effects on DNA methylation also contribute to the extension in lifespan observed in response to dietary restriction. Relationships between diet-induced changes in DNA methylation and parallel effects on aging and/or lifespan could, of course, be purely associative. Proof of these ideas requires experimental model systems in which it is possible to manipulate genome methylation status and to measure effects on aging and/or lifespan. Commonly-used short-lived and genetically-malleable metazoan species, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, are not suitable for such studies; the C. elegans genome is not methylated, and DNA methylation in Drosophila is dissimilar from mammalian DNA methylation, occurring at cytosines at sites other than in CpG sequences. The honeybee provides a potentially unique and tractable model for such studies. Female larval development into the long-lived queen phenotype or short-lived worker is determined purely by diet (royal jelly) through an effect on DNA methylation, and honeybee DNA methylation mirrors that of the mammalian genome. Mammalian cell lines and biochemical approaches offer complementary tools to address specific components of hypotheses relating to effects of diet on aging through DNA methylation in a more targeted manner. Our studies using mammalian cell lines are revealing effects of Sirt1 on DNA methylation, and indicate that Sirt1 and resveratrol affect the expression of different sets of genes.",

     "abstract": "Oxidatively modified proteins build-up with age results, at least in part, from the increase of reactive oxygen species and other toxic compounds originating from both cellular metabolism and external factors. Experimental evidence has also indicated that failure of protein maintenance is a major contributor to the age-associated accumulation of damaged proteins. We have previously shown that oxidized proteins as well as proteins modified by lipid peroxidation and glycoxidation adducts are accumulating in senescent human WI-38 fibroblasts and reported that proteins targeted by these modifications are mainly involved in protein maintenance, energy metabolism and cytoskeleton. Alterations in the proteome of human muscle adult stem cells upon oxidative stress have also been recently analyzed. The carbonylated proteins identified were also found to be involved in key cellular functions, such as carbohydrate metabolism, protein maintenance, cellular motility and protein homeostasis. More recently, we have built a database of proteins modified by carbonylation, glycation and lipid peroxidation products during aging and age-related diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases. Common pathways evidenced by enzymes involved in intermediate metabolism were found targeted by these modifications, although different tissues have been examined. These results underscore the implication of potential deleterious effects of protein irreversible oxidative modifications in key cellular pathways during aging and in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases.",

     "abstract": "Changes of factors circulating in the systemic environment during human aging have been investigated for a long time. Only recently however, miRNAs have been found to be secreted into the systemic and tissue environments where they are protected from RNAses by either carrier proteins or by being packaged into microvesicles. These miRNAs are then taken up by recipient cells, changing the cellular behavior by the classical miRNA induced silencing of target mRNAs. The origin of circulating miRNAs, however, is in most instances unclear, but senescent cells emerge as a possible source of such secreted miRNAs. Since differences in the circulating miRNAs have been found in a variety of age-associated diseases, and accumulation of senescent cells in the elderly emerges as a possible detrimental factor in aging, it is well conceivable that these miRNAs might contribute to the functional decline observed during aging of organisms.Therefore, we here give an overview on current knowledge on microvesicular secretion of miRNAs, changes of the systemic and tissue environments during aging of cells and organisms. Finally, we summarize current knowledge on miRNAs that are found to be specific for age-associated diseases.",

Provided they remain fit over lifetime, enduring stem cell activities avert the emergence of age-associated chronic degenerative diseases and pathologies.Although experimentally still unclear, it is assumed that stem cells reside in protected niches. Freshly isolated mesenchymal stem cells exhibit donor-specific aberrations, which cannot solely be ascribed to differences in genetic background. Besides inevitably accumulating intrinsic modifications, the systemic environment also impacts on basic properties of mesenchymal stem cells such as their inherent multi-lineage differentiation potential. Chronic systemic aberrations over time comprise unwholesome influences, in particular in terms of regeneration and repair when stem cells recapitulate distinct developmental programs. During or thereafter, stem cells can diversify either because of insufficiently silencing activated building cycles, or by acquiring epigenetic deviations.",

     "abstract": "The normal on and off switching of the PI3-K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt pathway, particularly by its major activators insulin and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1), is a powerful integrator of physiological responses rudimentary to successful aging. This is highlighted by extensive studies showing that reducing, but not obliterating, activation of the PI3-K/Akt/mTOR signal, at several levels, can extend healthy lifespan in organisms from yeast to mammals. Moreover, aberrant control of the PI3-K/Akt axis is emerging to be a primary causative node in all major diseases of aging: cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), heart disease and neurodegeneration. Aging is the major risk factor for AD, the most common dementia disorder. The integrated coordination of neuronal responses through the PI3-K/Akt pathway has significant functional impact on key events that go awry in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including: synaptic plasticity, neuronal polarity, neurotransmission, proteostasis, use-dependent translation, metabolic control and stress responses including DNA repair. Investigation of the status of the PI3-K/Akt system in brains of individuals who have had AD shows aberrant and sustained activation of neuronal PI3-K/Akt/mTOR signaling to be an early feature of the disease. This is mechanistically linked to progressive desensitization of normal brain insulin and IGF-1 responses, aberrant proteostasis of A\u03b2 and tau, synaptic loss and cognitive decline in the disease. Notably, concomitantly with feedback inhibition of insulin and IGF-1 responses, increased activation of the neuronal PI3-K/Akt/mTOR axis is a major candidate effector system for transmission of pathophysiological signals from A\u03b2 to tau in the context of defects in synaptic transmission that lead to cognitive decline. Therapeutic approaches targeted at normalizing signaling through either the neuronal PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway or its activation by insulin and IGF-1 have been shown to be protective against the development of AD pathology and cognitive decline in animal models of AD and some of these therapies are entering clinical trials in patients with the disease.",

     "abstract": "Cellular senescence is the state of permanent inhibition of cell proliferation. Replicative senescence occurs due to the end replication problem and shortening telomeres with each cell division leading to DNA damage response (DDR). The number of short telomeres increases with age and age-related pathologies. Stress induced senescence, although not accompanied by attrition of telomeres, is also attributed to the DDR induced by irreparable DNA lesions in telomeric DNA. Senescent cells characterized by the presence of \u03b3H2AX, the common marker of double DNA strand breaks, and other senescence markers including activity of SA-\u03b2-gal, accumulate in tissues of aged animals and humans as well as at sites of pathology. It is believed that cellular senescence evolved as a cancer barrier since non-proliferating senescent cells cannot be transformed to neoplastic cells. On the other hand senescent cells favor cancer development, just like other age-related pathologies, by creating a low grade inflammatory state due to senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Reversal/inhibition of cellular senescence could prolong healthy life span, thus many attempts have been undertaken to influence cellular senescence. The two main approaches are genetic and pharmacological/nutritional modifications of cell fate. The first one concerns cell reprogramming by induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which in vitro is effective even in cells undergoing senescence, or derived from very old or progeroid patients. The second approach concerns modification of senescence signaling pathways just like TOR-induced by pharmacological or with natural agents. However, knowing that aging is unavoidable we cannot expect its elimination, but prolonging healthy life span is a goal worth serious consideration.",

In many tissues, homeostasis and repair are supported by tissue-specific stem cells that induce to generate differentiated cells in accordance with physiological requirements. Heterochronic genes, initially described in worms, specify the timing of fate decisions in each cell type and thus ensure a synchronized program of development throughout the animal. The heterochronic let-7 microRNA plays an important role in development by repressing cell fate regulators to promote stage progression. Recent studies reveal a new role of let-7 which occurs much later in life and regulates aging of several tissues, across species. In this article I review the current knowledge on the fate mechanisms of tissue stem cells during aging that are modulate by let-7, as well as its co-partners and its target genes. I also discuss the therapeutic potential of controlling heterochronic events as a possible treatment for aging\u2010related disorders. Timing is a clear dimension of organisms' development that may be difficult to witness in aging stages that are not as defined as in embryonic development. Exploring the regulation of stem cell aging by let-7 may ultimately reveal novel timing mechanisms.",

Stress and aging have remarkably similar effects on brain. Both induce neuroinflammation and alter neuronal metabolism and activity, which to varying extents are causally-linked to the development of stress and aging pathology. As such, induction of one or more of these brain disturbances by either stress or aging could predispose for the development of dysfunction in the other. Notably, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) is expressed in brain regions that regulate both stress and aging (e.g., hippocampus) and can act to prevent the consequences of aging and stress on the brain. In addition, PPAR\u03b3 agonists reduce the physiological stress response itself.

As men grow older, their levels of testosterone decline while the prevalence of ill-health increases. Observational studies have linked lower testosterone levels with cardiovascular disease and mortality in middle-aged and older men. More recently, lower testosterone has been shown to predict reduced sexual activity and frailty in aging men. Additional studies are needed to determine whether lower testosterone is a biomarker or a potentially treatable risk factor for poorer health outcomes in older men. During aging, the response of the pituitary\u2013thyroid axis alters to manifest higher thyrotropin levels. The presences of subclinical hypo- and hyper-thyroidism predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Newer results indicate that in euthyroid older men, differences in free thyroxine levels within the normal range predict specific health outcomes including frailty.

     "abstract": "Adult dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are not well understood. Many DR studies have demonstrated that lifespan extension tends to be accompanied by a reduction in female fecundity \u2014 a correlation widely interpreted as evidence that DR triggers an adaptive re \u2013 allocation of resources from reproduction to somatic maintenance. Yet, recent evidence suggests that survival and fecundity need not always trade off under DR, calling the re-allocation hypothesis into question. Because the effects of DR on both survival and reproduction have rarely been tested in both sexes, or under a range of ecologically-relevant environments, the generality of this trade-off remains unclear. We examined the effects of DR on survival and reproduction in both sexes and across a range of environments (larval diet quality and adult sex ratio) in the neriid fly Telostylinus angusticollis. We found that the lifespan\u2013reproduction trade-off is both context- and sex-dependent. Although DR extended lifespan in both sexes by 65% and rendered females completely infertile, costs of DR on male fecundity were subtle and evident only in particular environmental combinations. Our findings suggest that a re-allocation of resources may not underlie the lifespan extension response to DR. Instead, full feeding may be associated with increased costs in comparison to DR, such that lifespan extension may be achieved without an increased resource investment to the soma.",

A number of waste macromolecules, including AGEs are taken up from the circulation by endocytosis mainly into liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs). However, AGEs still accumulate in different tissues with aging, despite the presence of this clearance mechanism. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the efficiency of LSECs and KCs for disposal of AGEs changes through aging.After intravenous administration of 14C-AGE-albumin in pre-pubertal, young adult, middle aged and old mice, more than 90% of total recovered 14C-AGE was liver associated, irrespective of age. LSECs and KCs represented the main site of uptake. A fraction of the 14C-AGE degradation products (14C-AGE-DPs) was stored for months in the lysosomes of these cells after uptake. The overall rate of elimination of 14C-AGE-DPs from the liver was markedly faster in pre-pubertal than in all post-pubertal age groups. The ability to eliminate 14C-AGE-DPs decreased to similar extents after puberty in LSECs and KCs. A rapid early removal phase was characteristic for all age groups except the old group, where this phase was absent.Removal of AGE-DPs from the liver scavenger cells is a very slow process that changes with age.

We have found in AD patients a significant decrease of APA activity in men but not in women, and of APN, APB and IRAP in both genders, when compared with control subjects. No changes were found in ASAP activity. Also, APN, APB and IRAP but not APA correlated with the Mini\u2013Mental test, but no relationship with APOE genotype was found.

     "abstract": "The senescence accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) strain of mice is an experimental model of accelerated senescence that also shares several pathological features with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, cognitive impairments and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau are ameliorated by the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil, possibly through the modulation of Cdk5/p25 and Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 pathways. Here we studied the implication of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the therapeutic effects of sildenafil. Results demonstrated that there were no differences in hippocampal PP2A protein levels or activity (measured by its inactive isoform phopho-PP2A Y307) when we compared 6-month old SAMP8 mice and age-matched control, SAMR1 mice, treated with saline or sildenafil (7.5\u00a0mg/kg i.p. for 4\u00a0weeks). However, this same treatment of sildenafil, that had been shown to reverse the cognitive impairment and tau hyperphosphorylation in this animal model, also reversed the increased levels of activated JNK (p-JNK) found in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice. Moreover, the administration of the JNK inhibitor, D-JNKI-1 (0.2\u00a0mg/kg i.p. for 3\u00a0weeks) also ameliorated the cognitive deficits shown by SAMP8 mice in the Morris water maze and decreased hippocampal levels of phospho-c-Jun(Ser73). When phosphorylated tau (AT8 epitope) was analyzed a significant reduction was observed in the hippocampus of D-JNKI-1 treated SAMP8 mice, providing a plausible explanation for the attenuation of cognitive decline shown by these animals. These findings suggest the involvement of the JNK pathway on tau pathology and cognitive deficits shown by 6-month old SAMP8 mice. They also point to the modulation of this kinase to be among the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects shown by sildenafil.",

This study was conducted to determine the effect of Mate on hyperlipidemia induced in hamsters by a high-fat diet, as well as its mechanism of action. Fifty male hamsters were randomly assigned to normal control, high-fat control, and high-fat with Mate tea aqueous extract (1%, 2% or 4% w/v) groups. We evaluated the effects of Mate aqueous extract on body weight, serum lipids, antioxidant enzyme activity, lipoprotein metabolism enzyme activity, and gene expression involved in lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic hamsters. Mate aqueous extract significantly decreased body-weight gain and lowered serum lipid levels in the hyperlipidemic hamster model. Meanwhile, Mate treatment increased antioxidant enzyme activity, improved lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities in serum and liver, upregulated mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 and low density lipoprotein receptor, and downregulated mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and acetyl CoA carboxylase in the liver. The results indicate that Mate tea ameliorates hyperlipidemia partly by reducing lipid peroxidation, improving endothelial function and LPL and HL activities, and modulating the expression levels of genes involved in lipid oxidation and lipogenesis.",

Although both intrinsic and extrinsic factors are hypothesized to impact this decreased T cell response, the direct evidence of an intrinsic deficiency in virus-specific CD8 T cells is limited. In this study, a TCR transgenic (Tg) P14 mouse model was utilized to compare the activation and proliferation of the Tg CD8 T cells of young and aged P14 mice upon stimulation with antigen or infection with virus. The proliferation of purified Tg CD8 T cells of aged mice was significantly lower than that of young mice when cultured in vitro with both the LCMV specific peptide and antigen presenting cells from young wild type mice. In addition, expression of the activation markers, CD69, CD25, and CD44, was delayed on Tg T cells of aged mice after stimulation. Importantly, while adoptive transfer of purified Tg CD8 T cells of young or aged mice into young wild type mice resulted in expansion of the Tg CD8 T cells of both ages after LCMV infection, the expansion of the Tg T cells from aged mice was significantly decreased compared with that of the Tg T cells from young mice. However, while the number of IFN-\u03b3 secreting Tg CD8 T cells from aged mice was significantly decreased compared to that of young mice, the percentages of Tg CD8 T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 were similar in young and aged mice, demonstrating that proliferation, but not function, of the Tg CD8 T cells of aged mice was impaired. Importantly, chronological age alone was not sufficient to predict an altered proliferative response; rather, expression of high levels of CD44 on CD8 T cells of aged mice reflected a decreased proliferative response. These results reveal that alterations intrinsic to CD8 T cells can contribute to the age-associated defects in the primary CD8 T cell response during viral infection.",

Survival time, the markers of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes, and resistance to hyperoxia were compared between SDR and SD rats, to investigate whether SDR, a dwarfism rat model, also extends lifespan and has an enhanced resistance to oxidative stress.SDRs lived 38% longer than SD rats on average. This is the first report to show that dwarf rats exhibit lifespan extensions similar to Ames and Snell mice. Decreased 8-oxo-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) content, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, indicated suppressed oxidative stress in the liver, kidney, and lung of SDRs. Increased glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity was consistent with decreased 8-oxodG content in the same tissues. The heart and brain showed a similar tendency, but this was not significant. However, the catalase and superoxide dismutase enzyme activities of SDRs were not different from those of SD rats in any tissue. This was not what the original null hypothesis predicted. SDRs had potent resistance to the toxicity associated with high O2 (85%) exposure. The mean survival time in SDRs was more than 147% that of SD rats with 168\u00a0h O2 exposure. These results suggest that the enhanced resistance to oxidative stress of SDRs associated with enhanced hydrogen peroxide elimination may support its potential role in lifespan extension.",

This search revealed that 19 genes were downregulated, and 43 genes were upregulated in S-hMSCs relative to Y-hMSCs. Among subtracted clones in Y-hMSCs, most of genes markedly were related to metabolic functions. These genes, PDIA3, WDR1, FSTL1, COPG1, LMAN1, and PDIA6, significantly downregulated. Conversely, genes for subtracted clones in S-hMSCs were mostly associated with cell adhesion.

Because of its central role in the pathogenesis of age-dependent and diabetes-mediated functional decline, we compared the levels of oxidatively modified protein markers, namely AGEs (Advanced Glycation End-protein adducts), 4-HNE (4-hydroxy-nonenal-histidine) and 3-NT (3-nitrotyrosine), in different tissues of young and old rats. Separately, these three oxidative stress parameters were explored in old rats subjected to experimentally induced diabetes and following a long-term treatment with a novel synthetic pyridoindole antioxidant derived from stobadine-SMe1EC2 (2-ethoxycarbonyl-8-methoxy-2,3,4,4a,5,9b-hexahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indolinium dichloride). Diabetes induced by streptozotocin injection in rats aged 13\u201315\u00a0months, and SMe1EC2 treatment was applied during 4\u00a0months to aged diabetic rats. AGEs and 4-HNE levels were significantly elevated in brain, ventricle and kidney, but not in lens and liver of aged rats when compared with young rats. Diabetes propagated ageing-induced increase in AGEs and 4-HNE in brain, ventricle and kidney, and raised significantly lens and liver AGEs and 4-HNE levels in aged rats. In aged diabetic rats, SMe1EC2 protected only the kidney against increase in AGEs, and inhibited significantly 4-HNE levels in brain, kidney, liver and lens that were observed more pronounced in lens. 3-NT was significantly increased in brain of aged rats and in kidney, lens and ventricle of aged diabetic rats, while SMe1EC2 has no protective effect on 3-NT increase. Results demonstrate that (1) the responsiveness of different tissue proteins to glyco-lipo-oxidative and nitrosative stress in the course of normal aging was miscellaneous. (2) Diabetes is a major factor contributing to accelerated aging. (3) SMe1EC2 selectively inhibited the generation of oxidatively modified proteins, only in a limited number of tissues.",

The rest-activity rhythm (RAR) in fish can be easily monitored and used to characterise the state of the CS, and it has also been proposed as a reliable model to study sleep-like periods in fish. As they aged, N. korthausae experienced a significant decrease in total daily activity and a progressive impairment of the RAR, accompanied by changes in the regularity, fragmentation and amplitude of the rhythm. The ability of the CS to oscillate autonomously when the two main synchronizers, photoperiod and feeding time, were absent (continuous darkness and random feeding), was also impaired with age, as the capacity to re-synchronise to the light\u2013dark (LD) cycle declined. Melatonin treatment improved the regularity, fragmentation and amplitude of the RAR in senescent fish, and it also improved sleep efficiency.

Using these ELISAs, 145 (73 female and 72 male) age-matched patients, aged 17 to 87\u00a0years, were tested.The results showed that the IgG1 and 3 subclass distribution was highly variable among individuals, and that female persons had significantly higher IgG3 titres than age-matched male persons (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0073). A correlation of the IgG3 subclass titres with age was found in female persons (Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a00.305, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0088).Thus the total HCMV specific IgG level appears to consist of a variable and gender associated distribution of IgG subclass ABs developed against persistent HCMV infection. The analysis of IgG subclass titres therefore could further be used to refine previously established clinical associations of aging with total HCMV specific IgG AB titres.",

     "abstract": "Sea urchins have a different life history from humans and traditional model organisms used to study the process of aging. Sea urchins grow indeterminately, reproduce throughout their life span and some species have been shown to exhibit negligible senescence with no increase in mortality rate at advanced ages. Despite these properties, different species of sea urchins are reported to have very different natural life spans providing a unique model to investigate cellular mechanisms underlying life span determination and negligible senescence. To gain insight into the biological changes that accompany aging in these animals, proteomic profiles were examined in coelomic fluid from young and old sea urchins of three species with different life spans: short-lived Lytechinus variegatus, long-lived Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus which has an intermediate life span. The proteomic profiles of cell-free coelomic fluid were complex with many proteins exhibiting different forms and extensive post-translational modifications. Approximately 20% of the protein spots on 2-D gels showed more than two-fold change with age in each of the species. Changes that are consistent with age in all three species may prove to be useful biomarkers for age-determination for these commercially fished marine invertebrates and also may provide clues to mechanisms of negligible senescence. Among the proteins that change with age, the ectodomain of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) was significantly increased in the coelomic fluid of all three sea urchin species suggesting that the Wnt signaling pathway should be further investigated for its role in negligible senescence.",

     "abstract": "Although the evolutionary theories of aging are quite well established, our knowledge about how we age is still very limited. The abundance and heterogeneity of available mechanistic theories of aging implicitly suggest that this phenomenon is overly complex and unlikely to be explained by a single pathway. Moreover, although aging remains a unique process, it is characterized by heterogeneous manifestations, not only determining inter-individual variations, but even intra-individual diversities. Such heterogeneity renders the inner nature of the aging process of difficult evaluation in older persons due to the potential biases introduced by multiple age-related social, biological, and clinical factors (and responsible for the evidence-based issue in geriatrics). Moving from the difficulties in translating anti-aging preclinical interventions into clinical trials, an alternative approach is illustrated. We encourage moving to a holistic evaluation of aging by adopting specific and consequent modifications in the design and conduction of clinical research. Such approach is today commonly applied in the clinical setting where the complexity of older patients often requires multidimensional interventions to adequately target the geriatric syndromes. Consistently, interventions targeting the aging process may result ineffective if too focused on a single underlying causal mechanism and/or failing to capture the complexity of the phenomenon. In this context, frailty (a geriatric syndrome characterized by age-related declines occurring across multiple physiologic systems) may indeed represent a clinically relevant threshold throughout the continuum of the aging process and a promising benchmark to test multidomain interventions against age-related conditions.",

This method was used to study the hypothenar muscle in the right hand of 27 sarcopenic patients.The mean MUNIX (111\u00a0\u00b1\u00a051) of all investigated sarcopenic patients lies between the mean MUNIX of healthy persons and the mean MUNIX of ALS patients. 25% of sarcopenic patients exhibit pathologic values for both MUNIX (<\u00a080) and MUSIX (>\u00a0100\u00a0\u03bcV). A strong correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.75, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) between MUSIX and the reciprocal value of MUNIX was identified.It was demonstrated for the first time by applying the MUNIX technique that loss of motoneurons plays a pathogenic role in the onset of sarcopenia. This was shown in 25% of sarcopenic participants who exhibited pathologic values for both MUNIX and MUSIX. Nerve sprouting seems to be an important mechanism of compensation for loss of motoneurons, reflected by the strong correlation between MUNIX and MUSIX. Use of MUNIX leads to the identification of a distinct subgroup of sarcopenic patients, which might have a major impact on future diagnostic and therapeutic concepts.",

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection may be particularly important for telomere and telomerase dynamics due to its dramatic impact on peripheral blood lymphocyte composition, i.e., increasing the number and proportions of highly differentiated T cells that are characterized by shorter telomere length (TL) and lowered telomerase activity (TA). However, the possible relationship between CMV infection and leukocyte TL and TA has not been well-examined in vivo. This study examined the associations of CMV seropositivity and CMV IgG antibodies with leukocyte (TL) and (TA) in a sample of 434 healthy individuals (ages 53\u201376) from the Whitehall II cohort. Positive CMV serostatus was significantly associated with lower TA among women, and higher CMV IgG antibody levels were associated with lower TA in the overall sample. However, neither CMV seropositivity nor CMV IgG antibody levels (reflecting subclinical reactivation) among the seropositive were significantly associated with TL. These associations were robust to adjustment for age, employment grade, BMI, and smoking status. The results demonstrate that CMV seropositivity and subclinical reactivation predict lower TA. Future longitudinal studies should test whether the association of CMV with lower TA contributes to accelerated telomere shortening over time.",

This study compares the health status and the functional status of three groups of subjects: 1. individuals with two long-lived parents (one of whom centenarian), 2. individuals with only one long-lived (centenarian) parent, and 3. individuals with no long-lived parents.The goal is to verify whether the centenarians' offspring display any advantage over the offspring of both non-long-lived parents and to evaluate whether the longevity of the non-centenarian parent provides a further advantage. A total of 374 subjects (mean age approximately 70\u00a0years) was examined. A threshold for longevity was established for non-centenarian parents through demographic data available for Italy (males surviving to at least 81\u00a0years of age and females to 87\u00a0years). The participants were assessed for their health and functional status by means of a standardized questionnaire and tests of physical performance. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression models adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors for age-related pathologies.The results of the study show that centenarians' offspring have a better functional status, a reduced risk for several age-related pathologies and reduced drug consumption than the offspring of non-long-lived parents. In addition, the health status of centenarians' offspring does not appear to be influenced by the longevity of the second parent. It therefore seems possible to conclude that at ages around 70\u00a0years the genetic contribution to health status deriving from having one centenarian parent is not substantially improved if the other parent is also long-lived.",

In the centenarian group, total adiponectin positively correlated with age and HDL-cholesterol, and HMW-adiponectin was negatively associated with insulin and triglycerides. The long-lived participants had a lower incidence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity, with lower concentrations of serum glucose and insulin, and reduced HOMA-IR.Our findings support the thesis that centenarians possess a different adiponectin isoform pattern and have a favorable metabolic phenotype in comparison with elderly individuals.

     "abstract": "Life history theory proposes that menopause is either an epiphenomenon or an adaptation. The most recent adaptive hypothesis proposes that menopause in humans has evolved because of conflict between reproducing generations (RCH). Overlapping reproduction between generations may impose fitness costs to older and younger females who co-breed. However, it has yet to be demonstrated by using a measure of evolutionary fitness (i.e. grandchildren). Here, we tested the RCH by using multigenerational life-history data of historical Norwegian women. Our results indicate that both generations seem to experience some fitness benefits with co-breeding (i.e. reproductive overlap and cohabit). This was because both younger and older females who co-bred had more grandchildren than those who did not co-breed. We suggest that younger females may partly had enhanced fitness because they copied behaviour of females of the older generation. Our results do not support the hypothesis that reproductive conflict between generations explains the evolution of menopause in women. Our results, taken together with the growing evidence against several assumptions of the RCH, indicate that 1) the decline in follicle number has no marked increase in women as they reach the age of 38\u00a0years; 2) humans do not have an abrupt decline in fertility at mean age of 38\u00a0years; 3) menopause is not unique to humans; and 4) there are not high numbers of individuals surviving to older adulthood during our evolutionary past. Finally, we discuss an alternative point of view suggesting that menopause might be understood in the light of both ageing in general as well as our increased lifespan.",

     "abstract": "Aging is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and impaired cerebral glucose homeostasis. These changes increase neural sensitivity to metabolic damage contributing to cognitive decline, being the decrease in plasma estrogen following menopause one of the main factors involved in aged females. Phytoestrogens as genistein are structurally similar to 17\u03b2-estradiol, bind to estrogen receptors, and can evoke both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects. Estrogens and phytoestrogens have neuroprotective potential, but the physiological mechanisms are not fully understood. Young and aged female Wistar rats were ovariectomized and treated acutely with 17\u03b2-estradiol (1.4\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight), genistein (10 or 40\u00a0mg/kg body weight), or vehicle. Cortical expression of glucose transporter-3 (GLUT-3) and -4 (GLUT-4), cytochrome c oxidase (CO), estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1) and -\u03b2 (ER\u03b2) was measured by Western blotting. There was an age-related decline in GLUT-4, CO and ER\u03b2 levels. Both drugs, estradiol and genistein, were able to reverse GLUT-3 downregulation in the cortex following late ovariectomy. However, genistein was the only treatment able to restore completely GLUT-4 levels in aged rats. In contrast, estradiol was more potent than genistein at increasing CO, a marker of cerebral oxidative metabolism. As regards ER levels, estradiol increased the ER\u03b167 quantity diminished by late ovariectomy, while genistein did the same with the other ER\u03b1 isoform, ER\u03b146, highlighting drug-specific differences in expression changes for both isoforms. On the other hand, no treatment-related differences were found regarding ER\u03b2 levels. Therefore, genistein like estradiol could be suitable treatments against cortical metabolic dysfunction caused by aging. These treatments may hold promise as neuroprotective strategies against diabetes and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

The results showed that 9\u00a0weeks of RET prevented the loss of muscle mass and improved muscle strength, accompanied by reduced LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, reduced p62 protein levels, and increased levels of autophagy regulatory proteins, including Beclin 1, Atg5/12, Atg7, and the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin L. RET also reduced cytochrome c level in the cytosol but increased its level in mitochondrial fraction, and inhibited cleaved caspase 3 production and apoptosis. Furthermore, RET upregulated the expression of IGF-1 and its receptors but downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. In addition, RET upregulated the expression of total AMPK, phosphorylated AMPK, and FOXO3a. Taken together, these results suggest that the benefits of RET are associated with increased autophagy activity and reduced apoptosis of muscle cells by modulating IGF-1 and its receptors, the Akt/mTOR and Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathways in aged skeletal muscles.",

     "abstract": "Aging is associated with a profound reduction of the immune capacity (i.e., immunosenescence), which is manifested as increased morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases in the elderly. The association of cytomegalovirus (CMV) with several aging-associated phenomena has been extensively characterized, e.g., the accumulation of CD8\u00a0+ nonproliferative, apoptosis-resistant memory cells that have lost the expression of the costimulatory molecule CD28. However, as the CMV seroprevalence is notably high in elderly individuals, the role of CMV-independent changes has been difficult to analyze. To address this question, we performed a transcriptomic analysis (Illumina Human HT12 microarray) of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a cohort of 90-year-old individuals (CMV seronegative, n\u00a0=\u00a06; CMV seropositive, n\u00a0=\u00a0140) using the PBMCs of young CMV-seronegative individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a011) as the controls. The cell type distribution (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD28 and CD14) was analyzed using FACS. The data showed that the gene expression profiles of the CMV\u00a0+ and CMV\u00a0\u2212 nonagenarians were different compared to the CMV\u00a0\u2212 controls. Compared to the CMV\u00a0\u2212 controls, 667 genes showed altered expression in the CMV\u00a0\u2212 nonagenarians, and 559 genes were altered in the CMV\u00a0+ nonagenarians. Of these, 337 genes were common. An analysis of the canonical pathways revealed that the number of affected pathways was also different (42 in CMV\u00a0\u2212, 13 in CMV\u00a0+; of these, 9 were common). Taken together, these results indicate that the CMV-dependent and CMV-independent changes in the aging of the immune system are fundamentally different.",

We therefore aimed to assess the relationship between circulating aldosterone levels and mortality in a population-based cohort study of female nursing home residents.Individuals aged 70\u00a0years and older were recruited from 95 nursing homes in Austria. Participants were enrolled and followed up by mobile study teams. All participants underwent an extensive health examination and were followed until death or end of the study. Serum aldosterone concentration (SAC) was measured at baseline after exclusion of twenty seven patients taking mineralocorticoid-receptor (MR) blockers.Median SAC was 171.1 (IQR: 103.2\u2013303.4) pg/mL (normal range: 30\u2013400) in 471 female individuals (mean age: 83.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2\u00a0years). After a median follow-up of 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0months, a total of 121 (25.7%) participants died. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, SAC levels stratified in quartiles were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Compared with the reference (first) SAC quartile, the Cox proportional hazard ratio (confidence interval 95%) for the fourth SAC quartiles was 1.94, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.08\u20133.46, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026.

     "abstract": "There are many evidences suggesting that oxidative stress is one of the earliest events in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis and plays a key role in the development of the AD pathology.The existence of substantial gender-related differences in the clinical features of AD has been recently confirmed (i.e. pathophysiologic features and epidemiologic trends). In addition, study results appear to indicate that the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of AD differ significantly in the 2 sexes. Based on previous results regarding changes in AD platelet plasma membrane, the purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of gender in the same model above reported. In particular we aimed at studying platelets from AD patients (M-AD and F-AD) and matched controls (M-C and F-C), divided into gender, by studying nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212) production, the intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ concentration ([Ca2\u00a0+]i), membrane Na+/K+-ATPase activity and fluidity.NO production was significantly elevated in platelets from both F-AD and M-AD compared to matched controls. M-AD showed NO production significantly higher than F-AD and it was the same between M-C and F-C. A similar trend was seen for ONOO\u2212.Platelets of both M-AD and F-AD had intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ concentrations significantly higher than F-C and M-C, while membrane Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed an opposite trend, but these differences are still significant.M-AD male subjects showed a significantly increased DPH fluorescence anisotropy (r) compared with controls, while for F-AD this discrepancy was not significant. The difference in DHP fluorescence anisotropy remained significant between M-AD and F-AD as well as between M-C and F-C.The TMA-DPH fluorescence anisotropy showed the same trend, but there were no significant differences between M-AD and F-AD, as well as between controls.The results of the current research support the conclusion that F-AD is not at greater risk than M-AD for oxidative stress injuries. Studies on gender differences could lead to a higher probability of improved health outcomes via better-targeted therapies.",

Thirty-seven healthy men and women (61.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0years) were randomly assigned to HRC (n\u00a0=\u00a016), TS (n\u00a0=\u00a014), or a control group (CG, n\u00a0=\u00a07). Training consisted of weight lifting twice a week for 12\u00a0weeks. Before and after the training, isokinetic peak torque in the upper and lower body, and body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry) were determined. In addition, cardiovascular parameters were evaluated during an incremental treadmill test. Both HRC and TS groups showed significant increases in isokinetic strength (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and the increase was significantly greater in the experimental groups than in CG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.03).

Several age-related cellular processes were evaluated, including telomere shortening, changes in p53 and p16 expression, changes in mitochondria DNA expression and DNA deletion, and alteration of mitochondria. We found that the aging of the B6 mice cardiac tissue is associated with the maintenance of telomere length, increased expression of p53 and p16, mild changes in mitochondrial DNA expression but widespread DNA deletion, and significant alterations of the mitochondrial ultrastructure within the cardiac tissue. The results of our studies suggest that mitochondrial DNA deletions, which affect the mitochondrial ultrastructure, cytochrome C oxidase activity, and p53 expression, are significantly associated with cardiac aging and may be a source of age-related heart failure.",

To determine whether increased longevity affects responses in other traits, we looked at several stress resistance traits (chill coma recovery, heat knockdown, desiccation and starvation), geotactic behaviour, egg-to-adult viability, body size, developmental time as well as metabolic rate. Longevity selected flies were more starvation resistant. However, in females longevity and fecundity were not negatively correlated with the other traits assayed. Males from longevity selected lines were slower at recovering from a chill induced coma and resting metabolic rate increased with age, but did not correlate with life span.",

     "abstract": "Maximum walking speed may offer an advantage over usual walking speed for clinical assessment of age-related declines in mobility function that are due to neuromuscular impairment. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which maximum walking speed is affected by neuromuscular function of the lower extremities in older adults. We recruited two groups of healthy, well functioning older adults who differed primarily on maximum walking speed. We hypothesized that individuals with slower maximum walking speed would exhibit reduced lower extremity muscle size and impaired plantarflexion force production and neuromuscular activation during a rapid contraction of the triceps surae muscle group (soleus (SO) and gastrocnemius (MG)).All participants were required to have usual 10-meter walking speed of >\u00a01.0\u00a0m/s. If the difference between usual and maximum 10\u00a0m walking speed was <\u00a00.6\u00a0m/s, the individual was assigned to the \u201cSlower\u201d group (n\u00a0=\u00a08). If the difference between usual and maximum 10-meter walking speed was >\u00a00.6\u00a0m/s, the individual was assigned to the \u201cFaster\u201d group (n\u00a0=\u00a012). Peak rate of force development (RFD) and rate of neuromuscular activation (rate of EMG rise) of the triceps surae muscle group were assessed during a rapid plantarflexion movement. Muscle cross sectional area of the right triceps surae, quadriceps and hamstrings muscle groups was determined by magnetic resonance imaging.Across participants, the difference between usual and maximal walking speed was predominantly dictated by maximum walking speed (r\u00a0=\u00a0.85). We therefore report maximum walking speed (1.76 and 2.17\u00a0m/s in Slower and Faster, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) rather than the difference between usual and maximal. Plantarflexion RFD was 38% lower (p\u00a0=\u00a0.002) in Slower compared to Faster. MG rate of EMG rise was 34% lower (p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) in Slower than Faster, but SO rate of EMG rise did not differ between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a0.73). Contrary to our hypothesis, muscle CSA was not lower in Slower than Faster for the muscle groups tested, which included triceps surae (p\u00a0=\u00a0.44), quadriceps (p\u00a0=\u00a0.76) and hamstrings (p\u00a0=\u00a0.98). MG rate of EMG rise was positively associated with RFD and maximum 10\u00a0m walking speed, but not the usual 10\u00a0m walking speed.These findings support the conclusion that maximum walking speed is limited by impaired neuromuscular force and activation of the triceps surae muscle group. Future research should further evaluate the utility of maximum walking speed for use in clinical assessment to detect and monitor age-related functional decline.",

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of different degrees of preoperative renal dysfunction on postoperative outcomes in patients older than 80\u00a0years of age.This is an observational study that included adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery in which data were collected prospectively. Patients were divided into groups according to their preoperative plasma creatinine and eGFR levels.From February 1997 to January 2010, 318 octogenarians underwent cardiac surgery. Of these, 140 patients (44%) had abnormal preoperative creatinine levels. A significantly higher incidence of postoperative sepsis (4% vs. 17%, p 0.03), CVA (1% vs. 6%, p 0.03), and prolonged hospital stay (16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 vs. 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016\u00a0days, p 0.04) were detected in patients with preoperative kidney dysfunction.

However, no significant increment in postoperative mortality with decreasing eGFR or increasing preoperative creatinine was demonstrated.A substantial increase in the risk of postoperative CVA and sepsis, but not mortality, was demonstrated in octogenarians with advanced but not mild degrees of preoperative CKD. Compared to younger patients, a high burden of comorbidities in octogenarians may have a greater influence on outcomes post cardiac surgery than impaired renal function. Our data may provide a rationale for modified risk stratification in octogenarian candidates for cardiac surgery.",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) not only contribute to oxidative stress and cell damage that lead to aging but also serve as signaling molecules. Sestrins are evolutionarily conserved in all multicellular organisms and are required for regenerating hyperoxidized forms of peroxiredoxins and ROS clearance. However, whether sestrins regulate longevity in metazoans is still unclear. Here, we demonstrated that SESN-1, the only sestrin ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans, is a positive regulator of lifespan. sesn-1 gene mutant worms had significantly shorter lifespans compared to wild-type animals, and overexpression of sesn-1 prolonged lifespan. Moreover, sesn-1 was found to play a key role in defense against several life stressors, including heat, hydrogen peroxide and the heavy metal copper; and sesn-1 mutants expressed higher levels of ROS and showed a decline in body muscle function. Surprisingly, loss of sesn-1 did not weaken the innate immune function of the worms. Together, these results suggest that SESN-1 is required for normal lifespan and its function in muscle cells prevents muscle degeneration over a lifetime.",

The objective of this study was to assess the independent association of WBC count and its individual components with mortality in an elderly population. We studied a total of 9996 participants (age\u00a0\u2265\u00a065\u00a0years) who underwent routine health examinations at the 2 healthcare centers affiliated with Seoul National University. Mortality data were obtained from the National Statistics Office of Korea. The mean age of the study population was 69.7 (SD 4.3) years, and 5491 of the subjects (54.9%) were male. The median length of follow-up was 44.9\u00a0months (range, 1.2\u201378.7\u00a0months). There were 118 deaths (1.2%) during the follow-up period. The leading cause of death was cancer. Compared with the survivors, the deceased subjects were older, predominantly male, had increased levels of inflammatory markers, and had poor nutritional status. A significant difference in mortality was identified among patients in different WBC and WBC subtype quartile groups. Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated that monocyte count (HR: 5.18, 95% CI: 2.44\u201311.02) was a strongest predictor of all-cause mortality than total WBC count (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 0.88\u20132.80), granulocyte count (HR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.15\u20133.88), and lymphocyte count (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.66\u20131.86), even after adjusting for possible confounding variables. Monocyte counts were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality in the elderly population.

In old rats, epinephrine is deficient at raising blood glucose levels and thus is only moderately effective at enhancing memory. In contrast, systemic glucose injections improve memory in old rats, with resulting memory performance equal to that of young rats. The diminished response of glucose to training in old rats may blunt downstream neurochemical and molecular mechanisms needed to upregulate memory processes. In the first experiment, young adult and old rats were trained on an inhibitory avoidance task with immediate post-training injections of aCSF or glucose into the dorsal hippocampus. Old rats had significant memory impairments compared to young rats 7\u00a0days after training. Intrahippocampal injections of glucose reversed age-related deficits, improving memory scores in old rats to values seen in young rats. A second experiment examined age-related changes in activation of the transcription factor CREB, which is widely implicated in memory formation and may act downstream of hormonal and metabolic signals. Activation was assessed in response to training with systemic injections of epinephrine and glucose at doses known to enhance memory. Young adult and old rats were trained on inhibitory avoidance with immediate post-training systemic injections of saline, epinephrine, or glucose. After training, old rats had significant impairments in CREB phosphorylation in area CA1 and the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus, and in the basolateral and lateral amygdala. Epinephrine and glucose attenuated age-related deficits in CREB phosphorylation, but were more effective in the amygdala and hippocampus, respectively. Together, these results support the view that age-related changes in blood glucose responses to epinephrine contribute to memory impairments, which may be related to alterations in regional patterns of CREB phosphorylation.",

     "abstract": "Cardiovascular dysfunction is a primary independent predictor of age-related morbidity and mortality. Frailty is associated with activation of inflammatory pathways and fatigue that commonly presents and progresses with age. Interleukin 10 (IL-10), the cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor, is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by immune and non-immune cells. Homozygous deletion of IL-10 in mice yields a phenotype that is consistent with human frailty, including age-related increases in serum inflammatory mediators, muscular weakness, higher levels of IGF-1 at midlife, and early mortality. While emerging evidence suggests a role for IL-10 in vascular protection, a clear mechanism has not yet been elucidated.In order to evaluate the role of IL-10 in maintenance of vascular function, force tension myography was utilized to access ex-vivo endothelium dependent vasorelaxation in vessels isolated from IL-10 knockout IL-10(tm/tm) and control mice. Pulse wave velocity ((PWV), index of stiffness) of vasculature was measured using ultrasound and blood pressure was measured using the tail cuff method. Echocardiography was used to elucidated structure and functional changes in the heart.Mean arterial pressures were significantly higher in IL-10(tm/tm) mice as compared to C57BL6/wild type (WT) controls. PWV was increased in IL-10(tm/tm) indicating stiffer vasculature. Endothelial intact aortic rings isolated from IL-10(tm/tm) mice demonstrated impaired vasodilation at low acetylcholine doses and vasoconstriction at higher doses whereas vasorelaxation responses were preserved in rings from WT mice. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2)/thromboxane A2 inhibitors improved endothelial dependent vasorelaxation and reversed vasoconstriction. Left ventricular end systolic diameter, left ventricular mass, isovolumic relaxation time, fractional shortening and ejection fraction were all significantly different in the aged IL-10(tm/tm) mice compared to WT mice.Aged IL-10(tm/tm) mice have stiffer vessels and decreased vascular relaxation due to an increase in eicosanoids, specifically COX-2 activity and resultant thromboxane A2 receptor activation. Our results also suggest that aging IL-10(tm/tm) mice have an increased heart size and impaired cardiac function compared to age-matched WT mice. While further studies will be necessary to determine if this age-related phenotype develops as a result of inflammatory pathway activation or lack of IL-10, it is essential for maintaining the vascular compliance and endothelial function during the aging process. Given that a similar cardiovascular phenotype is present in frail, older adults, these findings further support the utility of the IL-10(tm/tm) mouse as a model of frailty.",

     "abstract": "Falls are a geriatric syndrome which affects the physical and psychological well-being of the aged. So far, in Poland there have not been any population-based data on the prevalence of falls among the elderly.The aim of this analysis was to assess the prevalence of falls, their circumstances and consequences in the Polish population aged 65\u00a0years and older in comparison to younger respondents aged 55\u201359\u00a0years, and the relation of falls to visual and hearing deficits.Mean age of the 4920 elderly subjects (51.6% men) was 79.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7\u00a0years. Falls in the past year were reported by 10.4% of the younger and 19.1% of the older subjects. In both groups falls occurred more frequently in women (11.9% vs. 8.7%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03 in the younger and 22.7% vs. 13.2%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 in the older group). In the group of older subjects falls occurred most often during walking (66.7% vs. 50.7% in the group of 55\u201359\u00a0years old), p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), while the younger more often fell while practicing sports (5.48% vs. 0.8% in the group 65+, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and risky activities (respectively: 13.7% vs. 4.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). A similar percentage of younger and older fallers reported one (44.0% and 46.1% respectively) or more falls (56.1% and 53.9%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.6). The percentage of recurrent fallers grew with increasing age (Cc\u00a0=\u00a00.177; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The prevalence of injurious falls was similar in the younger and older groups (45.4% and 42.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.53). In both genders fall-related injuries were more frequent in younger elderly (65\u201374\u00a0years old) and in subjects 90\u00a0years old and older. In the non-standardized analysis and after adjustment for age and gender visual and hearing impairments and its degree were associated with falls but both relations lost statistical significance after adjustment for a set of explanatory variables.Despite somewhat lower estimates, falls in older Poles are no less an important factor influencing overall health than in other populations. The higher prevalence of multiple falls should draw attention of the health-care policy makers. Sensory impairment may add to the risk of falls and should be adequately taken care of, however the priority in the future fall prevention initiative should be given to stronger factors, such as age, type of activity, overall health, cognitive function and functional status.",

     "abstract": "We investigated and compared the effects of physiological menopause (PM) and early menopause (EM) and the adaptations promoted by physical training on the cardiovascular autonomic control of aged rats. Female Wistar rats (N\u00a0=\u00a072) were assigned to 3 groups: control (22\u00a0weeks old rats, undergoing sham surgery in the 10th week of life), PM (82\u00a0weeks old rats, undergoing sham surgery in the 10th week of life) and EM (82\u00a0weeks old rats, undergoing ovariectomy in the 10th week of life). In each group, half of the rats were subjected to swimming training over a period of 10\u00a0weeks. Sedentary PM and EM groups had higher basal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) and lower intrinsic HR compared to the sedentary control group. Physical training reduced MAP in PM group. All trained groups had lower basal HR; however, only control and PM-trained groups showed decreased intrinsic HR. The assessment of cardiac autonomic balance showed that PM and EM sedentary groups exhibited sympathetic predominance compared to control group. After physical training, only EM group presented sympathetic predominance. HR variability (pulse interval) was similar among all sedentary groups. However, control and PM-trained groups showed lower power in low frequency band (LF; 0.2\u20130.75\u00a0Hz) and higher power in high frequency band (HF; 0.75\u20133.0\u00a0Hz). The analysis of systolic arterial pressure variability revealed that PM and EM sedentary groups had higher LF power. However, PM group showed lower LF power following physical training. Finally, PM and EM groups had a reduction in spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity, that was attenuated by physical training. The overall results suggest that PM or EM promotes similar negative effects on MAP, HR and cardiovascular autonomic control. However, unlike the PM group, physical training was not able to mitigate all negative effects of EM on cardiovascular autonomic control.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of 4\u00a0days of disuse (knee brace) on contractile function of isolated vastus lateralis fibers (n\u00a0=\u00a0486) from 11 young (24.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0yrs) and 11 old (67.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0yrs) healthy men having comparable levels of physical activity. Prior to disuse single fiber specific force (maximal Ca2\u00a0+-activated force per cross-sectional area) was lower in MHC I vs. IIa fibers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) both in young (44%) and old (32%), and specific force of MHC IIa fibers was lower in old vs. young (19%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Further, Ca2\u00a0+ sensitivity was higher in MHC I vs. IIa fibers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in both age groups. Following disuse single fiber specific force decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in MHC I fibers in young (\u2212\u00a019%) and old (\u2212\u00a017%), and in MHC IIa fibers in young (\u2212\u00a021%) but not in old (\u2212\u00a011%; ns). The extent of these decreases did not differ between young and old. Ca2\u00a0+ sensitivity decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in MHC I fibers in old (\u2212\u00a00.11 pCa units) but not in young (\u2212\u00a00.08 pCa units; ns). The extent of these decreases was greater in old vs. young (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, 4\u00a0days of lower limb disuse led to marked impairments in single muscle fiber specific force independently of age, while changes in Ca2\u00a0+ sensitivity were dependent on age and MHC isoform composition. The present findings stress the importance of determining and implementing effective preventive and rehabilitative approaches for old individuals exposed to as little as 4\u00a0days of disuse.",

Here, we compared aging rates of 22 pairs of ruminant species living in captive and free-ranging conditions. Based on the recent suggestion that feeding niche is a key factor influencing aging in captivity, we also investigated whether a species' natural diet influences the aging rates of captive ruminants relative to their wild conspecifics. We found that aging rate in a given species was higher under free-ranging conditions than in captivity, which provides the first evidence of consistent aging rate variation within species. Additionally, our study clearly demonstrates that differences in aging rates between captive and free-ranging ruminants increased as species were more specialized on grass diets.",

Melatonin has been suggested as an effective free radical scavenger that might have a role during the process of aging. We observed, that melatonin administration (25\u00a0\u03bcg/100\u00a0g body weight for 30\u00a0days) significantly augments the activity of anti-oxidative enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the plasma, spleen and bone marrow (BM) of young (6\u00a0weeks), adult (30\u00a0weeks) and old aged (2.5\u00a0years) male golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus. A sharp decline in generation of ROS was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and splenocytes upon melatonin administration in different age group of hamsters. Reduction in the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and total nitrite and nitrate concentration as metabolites and indicators of nitric oxide (NO) in plasma, spleen and BM were observed along with night time (22:00\u00a0h) melatonin concentration in different age group of hamsters after administration of melatonin and compared to the control group (treated with 0.9% saline). General immune parameters like proliferation of splenocytes, PBMC and colony forming ability of GM-CFU were observed following melatonin treatment in different age group, although it was low only in aged hamsters compared to the young and adult. Our data indicates that the age related increase of oxidative load and simultaneously augments the general immunity in aged hamsters.",

     "abstract": "The prolonged effect of myostatin deficiency on muscle performance in knockout mice has as yet been only poorly investigated. We have demonstrated that absolute maximal force is increased in 6-month old female and male knockout mice and 2-year old female knockout mice as compared to age- and sex-matched wildtype mice. Similarly, absolute maximal power is increased by myostatin deficiency in 6-month old female and male knockout mice but not in 2-year old female knockout mice. The increases we observed were greater in 6-month old female than in male knockout mice and can primarily result from muscle hypertrophy. In contrast, fatigue resistance was decreased in 6-month old knockout mice of both sexes as compared to age- and sex-matched wildtype mice. Moreover, in contrast to 2-year old female wildtype mice, aging in 2-year old knockout mice reduced absolute maximal force and power of both sexes as compared to their younger counterparts, although muscle weight did not change. These age-related decreases were lower in 2-year old female than in 2-year old male knockout mice. Together these results suggest that the beneficial effect of myostatin deficiency on absolute maximal force and power is greater in young (versus old) mice and female (versus male) mice. Most of these effects of myostatin deficiency are related neither to changes in the concentration of myofibrillar proteins nor to the slow to fast fiber type transition.",

     "abstract": "Severe mitochondria deficiency leads to a number of devastating degenerative disorders, yet, mild mitochondrial dysfunction in different species, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, can have pro-longevity effects. This apparent paradox indicates that cellular adaptation to partial mitochondrial stress can induce beneficial responses, but how this is achieved is largely unknown. Complete absence of frataxin, the mitochondrial protein defective in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, is lethal in C. elegans, while its partial deficiency extends animal lifespan in a p53 dependent manner.In this paper we provide further insight into frataxin control of C. elegans longevity by showing that a substantial reduction of frataxin protein expression is required to extend lifespan, affect sensory neurons functionality, remodel lipid metabolism and trigger autophagy. We find that Beclin and p53 genes are required to induce autophagy and concurrently reduce lipid storages and extend animal lifespan in response to frataxin suppression. Reciprocally, frataxin expression modulates autophagy in the absence of p53. Human Friedreich ataxia-derived lymphoblasts also display increased autophagy, indicating an evolutionarily conserved response to reduced frataxin expression.In sum, we demonstrate a causal connection between induction of autophagy and lifespan extension following reduced frataxin expression, thus providing the rationale for investigating autophagy in the pathogenesis and treatment of Friedreich's ataxia and possibly other human mitochondria-associated disorders.",

     "abstract": "Resveratrol is reported as having neuroprotective properties, however, much of this reputation has come from research using disease and injury models of neurodegeneration and not neurodegenerative-ageing. The results published here pertain to the affect resveratrol has on neurodegenerative-ageing. Resveratrol had previously been used to extend the lifespan of Nothobranchius furzeri wherein it preserved cognition and reduced ageing-associated neurodegeneration. No cell-type specific antibodies were then identified which could be used to investigate the nature of the neurodegeneration or resveratrols effect on CNS cells. Using wholemounts stained with SMI31 anti-phospho-neurolament, GA-5 and DAKO Z0334 anti-GFAP antibodies, E587 antiserum against NCAMs and anti-Tenascin-R antibodies we determined what cellular changes occurred with age in the optic tectum of Nothobranchius guentheri. We show that resveratrol-treatment extended the lifespan of N. guentheri but did not preserve neuron density of the optic tectum stratum griseum superciale even though it did reduce the proportion of degenerate (SMI31 antigen accumulating) neurons in the optic tectum. Resveratrol-treatment did prevent the ageing-dependent loss of radial glia lining the optic tectum of N. guentheri. The ageing-related loss of NCAM expression and Tenascin-R expressing perineuronal nets was also prevented by resveratrol-treatment. Glial and perineuronal density as well as NCAM expression appear to correlate well with age. These results suggest that the anti-ageing properties of resveratrol in vertebrates may be unrelated to the protection of neurons.",

     "abstract": "The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is characterized by a high degree of phenotypic plasticity of senescence-related processes, and has therefore become a model organism of gerontological research. Sperm of honey bee drones can remain fertile for several years within the storage organ of queens. The reason for this longevity is unknown, but the suppression of lipid peroxidation seems to play a decisive role. Here, we examined the questions of whether spermatheca- and in vitro-stored honey bee sperm are indeed resistant to lipid peroxidation, and whether the nature of sperm lipids could explain this resistance. The lipid composition of bee sperm was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI\u2013TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) combined with thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The positive ion mass spectra of drone sperm lipids are dominated by two glycerophosphocholine (GPC) species, although small amounts of sphingomyelins (SM) and glycerophosphoethanolamines (GPE) are also detectable after TLC. Alkyl/acyl and alkenyl/acyl compounds of GPC, and alkyl/acyl as well as diacyl compounds of GPE were detected containing oleyl, oleoyl, palmityl and palmitoyl as the most abundant residues. Assignments of all compounds have been additionally verified by enzymatic digestion and exposition to HCl. During incubation of sperm in the presence of air, characteristic lipid oxidation products such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) appear. Inside the spermatheca, however, sperm lipids are obviously protected from oxidation and their composition does not change, even if they are stored over years. Our data support the view that the membrane composition of honey bee sperm could help to explain the extraordinary longevity of these cells.",

The study was performed to seek for a relationship between AGE and LF in cardiocytes of the failing hearts.Archived tissue samples from 136 hearts explanted before transplantation (in 14 pts. with ischemic cardiomyopathy (CM) and DM2; 8 pts. with dilated CM and DM2; 67 non-diabetic pts. with ischemic CM; 47 non-diabetic pts. with dilated CM), 14 autopsy cases with DM2, and 20 heart donors (control group) were involved in the study. Immunohistochemical localization of AGE was applied. The coexistence of lipofuscin and AGE was studied by LF autofluorescence in AGE-positive slides.LF granules inside AGE deposits were present in all studied groups with varying frequencies, but the differences were non-significant. LF granules joined significantly with dispersed patterns of AGE i.e. diffuse and mixed, whereas coincidence of LF and AGE forming granular pattern was rare.We demonstrate that LF may belong to the components of the AGE deposits. The frequency of this phenomenon is dependent on the AGE dispersion grade, but neither on diabetes nor cardiomyopathy presence.",

     "abstract": "Larval feeding with curcumin induces an extended health span with significantly increased median and maximum longevities in the adult fly. This phenotype is diet insensitive and shows no additive effect on longevity when combined with an adult dietary restriction (DR) diet, suggesting that curcumin and DR operate via the same or overlapping pathways for this trait. This treatment significantly slows the aging rate so that it is comparable with that of genetically selected long lived animals. The larval treatment also enhances the adult animal's geotactic activity in an additive manner with DR, suggesting that curcumin and DR may use different pathways for different traits. Feeding the drug to adults during only the health span also results in a significantly extended health span with increased median and maximum life span. This extended longevity phenotype is induced only during these stage-specific periods. Feeding adults with the drug over their whole life results in a weakly negative effect on median longevity with no increase in maximum life span. There are no negative effects on reproduction, although larval curcumin feeding increases development time, and also apparently accelerates the normal late-life neuromuscular degeneration seen in the legs. Gene expression data from curcumin-fed larvae shows that the TOR pathway is inhibited in the larvae and the young to midlife adults, although several other genes involved in longevity extension are also affected. These data support the hypothesis that curcumin acts as if it is a DR mimetic nutraceutical. These data also suggest that the search for DR mimetics may be enhanced by the use of stage-specific screening of candidate molecules.",

Mostly deleterious effects are noted when administered by either method to the long-lived La strain. Thus \"mid- to late-life\" drugs may have different stage-specific effects on different genomes of a model organism. A different HDAcI (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA) administered to the normal-lived strain showed similar late-life extending effects, suggesting that this is not an isolated effect of one drug. These data also show that the use of an HDAcI can significantly alter the mortality rate of the senescent span by decreasing its vulnerability, or short-term risk of death, in a manner similar to that of dietary restriction.

We compared elbow flexor fatigue of young (n\u00a0=\u00a010, 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0years) and old men (n\u00a0=\u00a016, 73.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0years) during and in recovery from a dynamic and an isometric postural fatiguing task. Each task was maintained until failure while supporting a load equivalent to 20% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess supraspinal fatigue (superimposed twitch, SIT) and muscle relaxation. Time to failure was longer for the old men than for the young men for the isometric task (9.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1 vs. 17.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.0\u00a0min, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) but similar for the dynamic task (6.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0min vs. 6.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0min, P\u00a0=\u00a00.73). Initial peak rate of relaxation was slower for the old men than for the young men, and was associated with a longer time to failure for both tasks (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Low initial power during elbow flexion was associated with the greatest difference (reduction) in time to failure between the isometric task and the dynamic task (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.54, P\u00a0=\u00a00.015). SIT declined after both fatigue tasks similarly with age, although the recovery of SIT was associated with MVIC recovery for the old (both sessions) but not for the young men. Biceps brachii and brachioradialis EMG activity (% MVIC) of the old men were greater than that of the young men during the dynamic fatiguing task (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but were similar during the isometric task. Muscular mechanisms and greater relative muscle activity (EMG activity) explain the greater fatigue during the dynamic task for the old men compared with the young men in the elbow flexor muscles. Recovery of MVC torque however relies more on the recovery of supraspinal fatigue among the old men than among the young men.",

The purpose of the present study was to examine the age-related differences in maximal and rapid torque characteristics of the leg extensor and flexor muscle groups in young, middle-aged, and old men. Sixty-five healthy men were categorized by age as young (n\u00a0=\u00a025; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD age\u00a0=\u00a024.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0years), middle-aged (n\u00a0=\u00a022; age\u00a0=\u00a050.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0years), and old (n\u00a0=\u00a018; age\u00a0=\u00a066.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0years). Participants performed maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the leg extensors and flexors and an estimated thigh cross sectional area (eThighCSA) assessment. Peak torque (PT), peak rate of torque development (RTDpeak), absolute RTD and the contractile impulse (IMPULSE) were calculated at time intervals of 30, 50, 100 and 200\u00a0ms from the torque\u2013time curve. Relative RTD was calculated at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% of MVC from the normalized torque\u2013time curves. PT, RTDpeak and later rapid torque variables (RTD100, RTD200, and IMPULSE200) were greater (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) in the young and middle-aged when compared to the old men for both muscle groups. Early (RTD30,50; IMPULSE30,50) and late (IMPULSE100) rapid torque variables were greater (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) for the young and middle-aged than the old men for the leg extensors but not the leg flexors, except for RTD30, in which there was no difference between young and old. There were no differences for all relative RTD variables between age groups (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). eThighCSA was lower in the old compared to the young (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and middle-aged (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016) men. Maximal and rapid torque characteristics were preserved in middle-aged men but greatly reduced in older men with differential effects at early and late portions of the torque\u2013time curve between the leg extensors and flexors. Significant decreases in absolute maximal and rapid torque production with no change in relative RTD across age groups and lower eThighCSA in old men may suggest that the loss of rapid torque producing capacities observed in older men may be largely a function of mechanisms associated with loss of muscle strength and muscle mass.",

     "publication date": "02-2013",
     "abstract": "When descending stairs bodyweight becomes supported on a single limb while the forwards-reaching contralateral limb is lowered in order to make contact with the step below. This is associated with lowering of the centre of mass (CoM), which in order to occur in a controlled manner, requires increased ankle and knee joint torque production relative to that in overground walking. We have previously shown that when descending steps or stairs older people operate at a higher proportion of their maximum eccentric capacity and at, or in excess of the maximum passive reference joint range of motion. This suggests they have reduced and/or altered control over their CoM and we hypothesised that this would be associated with alterations in muscle activity patterns and in the CoM vertical acceleration and velocity profiles during both the lowering and landing phases of stair descent. 15 older (mean age 75\u00a0years) and 17 young (mean age 25\u00a0years) healthy adults descended a 4-step staircase, leading with the right limb on each stair, during which CoM dynamics and electromyographic activity patterns for key lower-limb muscles were assessed. Maximum voluntary eccentric torque generation ability at the knee and ankle was also assessed. Older participants compared to young participants increased muscle co-contraction relative duration at the knee and ankle of the trailing limb so that the limb was stiffened for longer during descent. As a result older participants contacted the step below with a reduced downwards CoM velocity when compared to young participants. Peak downwards and peak upwards CoM acceleration during the descent and landing phases respectively, were also reduced in older adults compared to those in young participants. In contrast, young participants descended quickly onto the step below but arrested their downward CoM velocity sooner following landing; a strategy that was associated with longer relative duration lead-limb plantar flexor activity, increased peak upwards CoM acceleration, and a reduced landing duration. These results suggest that a reduced ability to generate high eccentric torque at the ankle in the forward reaching limb is a major factor for older participants adopting a cautious movement control strategy when descending stairs. The implications of this CoM control strategy on the incidences of falling on stairs are discussed.",

In addition, age-associated changes in the relative expression of these factors in musculoskeletal tissues have not been described. We therefore examined changes in protein levels of activin A, follistatin, and myostatin (GDF-8) in both muscle and bone with age in C57BL6 mice using ELISA. We then investigated the effects of activin A, myostatin and follistatin on the proliferation and differentiation of primary myoblasts and mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in vitro. Myostatin levels and the myostatin:follistatin ratio increased with age in the primarily slow-twitch mouse soleus muscle, whereas the pattern was reversed with age in the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus muscle. Myostatin levels and the myostatin:follistatin ratio increased significantly (+\u00a075%) in mouse bone marrow with age, as did activin A levels (+\u00a017%). Follistatin increased the proliferation of primary myoblasts from both young and aged mice, whereas myostatin increased proliferation of younger myoblasts but decreased proliferation of older myoblasts. Myostatin reduced proliferation of both young and aged BMSCs in a dose-dependent fashion, and activin A increased mineralization in both young and aged BMSCs. Together these data suggest that aging in mice is accompanied by changes in the expression of activin A and myostatin, as well as changes in the response of bone and muscle progenitor cells to these factors. Myostatin appears to play a particularly important role in the impaired proliferative capacity of muscle and bone progenitor cells from aged mice.",

In addition, we performed immunohistochemical staining for p53 and for ED-1-positive cells (macrophages/monocytes), together with Western blotting of kidney tissue for NKCC2, aquaporin 2 (AQP2), urea transporter A1 (UT-A1) and Klotho protein. At baseline, the two groups were similar in terms of creatinine clearance, proteinuria, cholesterol, and TBARS. At the end of the follow-up period, NAC-treated rats presented greater inulin clearance and reduced proteinuria, as well as lower serum cholesterol, serum TBARS, and urinary phosphate excretion, in comparison with untreated rats. In addition, NAC-treated rats showed upregulated expression of NKCC2, AQP2, and UT-A1; elevated Klotho protein expression, low p53 expression, and few ED-1 positive cells. In conclusion, we attribute these beneficial effects of NAC (the significant improvements in inulin clearance and in the expression of NKCC2, AQP2, and UT-A1) to its ability to decrease oxidative stress, inhibit p53 expression, minimize kidney inflammation, and stimulate Klotho expression.",

Although the mechanisms underlying CAA and SP formation remain largely unknown, evidence is mounting that local alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain vessel wall and/or parenchyma play an important role. Lysyl oxidase (LOX, E.C. 1.4.3.13) is an inducible amine oxidase that modulates the ECM by catalyzing the formation of molecular covalent cross-links in ECM proteins. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of LOX with CAA and with classic and diffuse SPs in both AD and HCHWA-D cases. We observed an association of LOX with A\u03b2 in CAA and with A\u03b2 in both classic and diffuse SPs in AD and HCHWA-D cases. In addition, LOX staining was observed in reactive astrocytes associated with these lesions. We conclude that the ECM modulating enzyme LOX is associated with the A\u03b2-related pathological hallmarks of both AD and HCHWA-D, and that our findings provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation of these lesions.",

The animals were submitted to two exercise protocols: single session or chronic treadmill protocol. DNMT1 and H3-K9 methylation levels were decreased in hippocampus from aged rats. The single exercise session decreased both DNMT3b and DNMT1 levels in young adult rats, without any effect in the aged group. Both exercise protocols reduced H3-K9 methylation levels in young adult rats, while the single session reversed the changes on H3-K9 methylation levels induced by aging.

     "abstract": "Diet and pollution are environmental factors known to compromise \u201chealthy aging\u201d of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The molecular consequences of this permanent burden in these cells are still unknown. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unhealthy diet on aging-related signaling pathways of human, primary cardiovascular cells and of airborne particles on lung epithelial and human endothelial cells. Nutrition health reports have shown that the diet in industrialized countries contains more than 100\u00a0mg/dl low density lipoprotein (LDL) and a high fraction of added sugars, especially fructose. Several studies demonstrated that ultrafine particles can enter the circulation and thus may interact with endothelial cells directly. Both, dietary compounds and pollution derived particles, have been shown to increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases. To simulate an unhealthy diet, we supplemented cell culture media of human primary endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes with LDL and replaced 1/3 of glucose with fructose. We observed hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes, enhanced proliferation in smooth muscle cells and increased senescence, loss of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and increased nuclear FoxO3A in endothelial cells. With respect to pollution we have used ultrafine carbon black particles (ufCB), one of the major constituents of industrial and exhaust emissions, in concentrations our lungs and vessels are constantly exposed to. These concentrations of ufCB increased reactive oxygen species in lung epithelial and vascular endothelial cells and reduced the S\u2013NO content, a marker for NO-bioavailability, in endothelial cells. NO increases activation of Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT), an enzyme essential for telomere maintenance. TERT is required for proper endothelial cell function and is inactivated by Src kinase under conditions of oxidative stress. ufCB significantly increased Src kinase activation and reduced Telomerase activity in endothelial and lung epithelial cells. As a consequence, ufCB increased senescence of endothelial cells. To investigate whether ufCB show also effects in vivo, we instilled ufCB in concentrations not inducing inflammation into mice. Indeed, eNOS expression was reduced in the abdominal aorta of animals treated with ufCB.Thus, a combination of fructose and LDL in the diet and ufCB, as a major constituent of air pollution, seem to accelerate respiratory and cardiovascular cellular changes, which may compromise \u201chealthy aging\u201d and can lead to cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases.",

     "abstract": "A major challenge in age research is the absence of short-lived vertebrate model organisms. The turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri has the shortest known lifespan of a vertebrate that can be bred in captivity. The short lived GRZ strain only reaches a maximum age of 3\u20134\u00a0months, whereas other strains (MZM) reach 6\u201310\u00a0months. Most importantly, the short lifespan is associated with typical signs of ageing. To find out more about possible cellular factors that might contribute to the short lifespan and to the difference in lifespan between strains, we analyzed the expression of markers for cellular senescence. Expression of Tp53, Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a/b in skin revealed no change in the short-lived GRZ but increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitors Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a/b in the long-lived MZM strain with age. This suggests that expression of distinct cell cycle inhibitors reflects rather chronological than biological age in N. furzeri. To study the relationship of organismal life span and in vitro life span of cells, we established a primary cell culture model. For both strains we demonstrate here the absence of replicative senescence as analysed by morphology, expression of Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a/b, population doubling times and \u03b3H2AFX in long-term and short-term cultured cells. We reason this to be on account of sustained telomerase activity and maintained telomeric length. Hence, we propose that differences in maximum life span of different N. furzeri strains is not reflected by differences in proliferation speed or replicative potential of the respective cultured cells.",

The enzymatic solubility of fibrillar collagens correlated inversely with the AGE load in the insoluble collagen as detected by the AGE-related fluorescence. While the intensity of the AGE-related fluorescence was increased in fibrillar collagens in response to age, the fluorescing AGE variant argpyrimidine was less affected.

     "abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) seem to be involved in aging as well as in the development of cardiovascular diseases. During aging, AGEs accumulate in extracellular matrix proteins like collagen and contribute to vessel stiffness. Whether non-invasive measurement of AGE accumulation in the skin may reflect vessel function and vessel protein modification is unknown. Herein we set out to analyze the AGE-modifications in the collagens extracted from residual bypass graft material, the skin autofluorescence reflecting the accumulation of AGEs in the body as well as the pulse wave velocity reflecting vessel stiffness.Collagen types I and III (pepsin digestible collagen fraction) were isolated from the veins of 52 patients by proteolysis. The residual collagen fraction was further extracted by collagenase digestion. Collagen was quantified by hydroxyproline assay and AGEs by the AGE intrinsic fluorescence. Skin autofluorescence was measured with an autofluorescence reader; pulse wave velocity with the VICORDER\u00ae.The collagen AGE autofluorescence in patient vein graft material increased with patient age. The pepsin digestible collagen fraction was significantly less modified in comparison to the collagenase digestible fraction. Decreasing amounts of extracted collagenase digestible collagen correspond with increasing AGE autofluorescence. Skin autofluorescence and vessel stiffness were significantly linked to the AGE autofluorescence of the collagenase digestible collagen fraction from graft material. In conclusion we have found that skin autofluorescence and pulse wave velocity as non-invasive parameters significantly correlate with the AGE contained in graft material and therefore are strong predictors of vessel AGE modifications in patients with coronary heart disease. Whether the analysis of the skin autofluorescence leads to an improvement of the risk stratification in patients suffering from cardiovascular disease has to be further tested.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the regulation of normal cellular function. When ROS are produced in excess they can have detrimental effects, a state known as oxidative stress. Thus ROS play both physiological and pathophysiological roles in the body. In clinical practice oxidative stress and its counterpart, antioxidant capacity can be measured and can guide remedial therapy. Oxidative stress can have a negative impact in all forms of major surgery including cardiac surgery, general surgery, trauma surgery, orthopedic surgery and plastic surgery; this is particularly marked in an ageing population. Many different therapies to reduce oxidative stress in surgery have been tried with variable results. We conclude that in surgical patients the assessment of oxidative stress, improvement of the understanding of its role, both positive and negative, and devising appropriate therapies represent fruitful fields for future research.",

     "abstract": "Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, heart failure, and premature cardiac aging. In the heart, intrinsic activation of the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) plays a pivotal role in the stress response to ischemia and hypertrophy. Furthermore, AMPK is an important regulator of cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of obesity and aging on the AMPK signaling pathway in human cardiac tissue.60 male cardiac surgery patients were included in the study and divided into 4 groups (old normal weight: ON; old obese: OO; young normal weight: YN, young obese: YO) according to their body mass index (18.5\u201325: normal weight or 30\u201335: obese) and age (<\u00a055\u00a0years: young or >\u00a070: old) with 15 patients each. Right atrial tissue (RA) was analyzed for the expression of the AMPK upstream kinases CAMKK and LKB1, activation of AMPK as well as phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream targets ACC, eEF2, mTOR and eNOS. Epicardial adipose tissue was analyzed for the expression of the endogenous AMPK activator adiponectin. The metabolic state of all patients was further characterized in fasting blood samples.Old patients (ON, OO) and young obese (YO) subjects displayed higher fasting glucose, insulin and leptin serum levels compared to the young, normal weight group, although HbA1c was below the threshold required for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Serum adiponectin as well as total adiponectin protein expression in epicardial adipose tissue was decreased in these three groups. Analyses of adiponectin isoforms by native gel electrophoresis revealed significant differences in the high molecular weight (HMW) isoforms between the groups. Despite the low total serum adiponectin and HMW adiponectin, AMPK activation was high in the RA of obese patients (YO, OO). Among the AMPK upstream kinases, LKB1 expression showed a strong positive correlation with AMPK activation. While the phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream targets mTOR, eEF-2 and ACC was not altered, phospho-eNOS was significantly lower in old patients (ON, OO). Despite strong AMPK activation, mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration were impaired in old (ON, OO) and young obese (YO) subjects.These data indicate that obesity and aging result in significant changes although many direct parameters in the AMPK signaling pathway are not changed in the same direction. LKB1 may represent a stronger activator of the AMPK pathway than adiponectin or the CAMKKs in human right atrial tissue.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a recently defined medical condition described as age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. Recently, a transgenic mouse model was described linking dispersal of the neuromuscular junction caused by elevated agrin degradation to the rapid onset of sarcopenia. These mice show a significant elevation of serum levels of a C-terminal agrin fragment (CAF) compared to wild-type littermates. A series of experiments was designed to ascertain the significance of elevated agrin degradation in the development of human sarcopenia. A quantitative Western blot method was devised to detect CAF in sera of humans. A first trial on consenting blood donors (n\u00a0=\u00a0169; age 19\u201374\u00a0years) detected CAF in the limited range of 2.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.95\u00a0ng/ml. In sarcopenia patients (diagnosed according to clinical and instrumental standards) mean CAF levels were significantly elevated (p\u00a0=\u00a09.8E10-9; n\u00a0=\u00a073; age 65\u201387\u00a0years) compared to aged matched controls. Of all sarcopenia patients, 40% had elevated, non-overlapping CAF levels compared to controls. Evidence is presented for a pathogenic role of the agrin/neurotrypsin system in a substantial subset of sarcopenia patients. These patients are characterized by elevated CAF blood levels compared to aged-matched healthy volunteers suggesting the identification of an agrin-dependent form of sarcopenia. Elevated CAF levels in a large subpopulation of sarcopenic patients suggest the existence of a specific form of sarcopenia for which CAF could become a biomarker and a new target for therapeutic interventions. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by the development of a small molecule capable of inhibiting neurotrypsin in vitro and in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia is considered to be an enormous burden for both the individuals affected and for society at large. A multifactorial aetiology of this geriatric syndrome has been discussed. Amongst other pathomechanisms, the degeneration of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) may be of major relevance. The intact balance between the pro-synaptic agent agrin and the anti-synaptic agent neurotrypsin ensures a structurally and functionally intact NMJ. Excessive cleavage of the native motoneuron-derived agrin by neurotrypsin into a C-terminal Agrin Fragment (CAF) leads to functional disintegration at the NMJ and may consecutively cause sarcopenia. The present study evaluates the hypothesis that CAF serum concentration is a potential marker for the loss of appendicular lean mass in older adults. It also explores how CAF concentration is influenced by vitamin D supplementation and physical exercise.Serum was taken from 69 (47 female) prefrail community-dwelling older adults participating in a training intervention study to measure the CAF concentration using the Western blot technique. All participants were supplemented orally with vitamin D3 before the training intervention period commenced. Appendicular lean mass (aLM) was evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Multiple linear regression models were used to identify factors significantly associated with CAF concentration.Appendicular lean mass, age and sex were identified as significant explanatory factors for CAF concentration. Gait speed and hand grip strength were not associated with CAF concentration. Male participants showed a strong correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.524) between CAF serum concentration and aLM, whereas this was not the case (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.219) in females. Vitamin D supplementation and physical exercise were significantly associated with a reduction in CAF concentration, especially in participants with initially high CAF concentrations.C-terminal Agrin Fragment could be a potential marker for identifying sarcopenia in a subgroup of affected individuals in the future. The decline of muscle mass seems to be a CAF-associated process in males, whereas the situation in females may be more complex and multifactorial. CAF concentration is reduced by vitamin D supplementation and physical exercise and therefore suggests a potentially positive effect on NMJs. Further prospective studies of sarcopenic patients in addition to muscle biopsy and electromyographical investigations are planned to verify the external validity of the CAF concept.",

Our aim was to investigate the associations between physical activity in midlife and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) measured in old age in the Helsinki Businessmen Study, Finland. At entry, in 1974, 782 men (mean age 47) completed a questionnaire about their physical activity and this was collapsed into 3 categories: low (n\u00a0=\u00a0148), moderate (n\u00a0=\u00a0398) and high physical activity (n\u00a0=\u00a0236, 7 of whom had a competitive activity level).

Adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol and smoking in 1974, the moderate physical activity group had longer mean LTL (8.27\u00a0kB, SE 0.05) than the low (8.10\u00a0kB, SE 0.07), or high (8.10\u00a0kB, SE 0.05) physical activity groups (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03 between groups).

     "abstract": "Aging is the progressive shrinkage of the homeodynamic space. A crucial component of the homeodynamic space is the stress response (SR), by virtue of which a living system senses disturbance and initiates a series of events for maintenance, repair, adaptation, remodeling and survival. Here we discuss the main intracellular SR pathways in human cells, and argue for the need to define and establish the immediate and delayed stress response profiles (SRP) during aging. Such SRP are required to be established at several age-points, which can be the molecular biomarkers of homeodynamic space and the health status of cells and organisms. SRP can also be useful for testing potential protectors and stimulators of homeodynamics, and can be a standard for monitoring the efficacy of potential pro-survival, health-promoting and aging-modulating conditions, food components and other compounds. An effective strategy, which makes use of SRP for achieving healthy aging and extending the healthspan, is that of strengthening the homeodynamics through repeated mild stress-induced hormesis by physical, biological and nutritional hormetins. Furthermore, SRP can also be the basis for defining health as a state of having adequate physical and mental independence of activities of daily living, by identifying a set of measurable parameters at the most fundamental level of biological organization.",

A series of recent investigations have demonstrated that the threshold and linear dose response model failed to make accurate predictions in the low dose zone. Such findings demonstrate a profound failure by the toxicology community on the central pillar of its discipline and one with profound public health, medical and economic implications. Ironically, the hormetic dose response, which was rejected by the toxicology community during the early decades of the 20th century, accurately predicted responses in the low dose zone in the same three large-scale validation assessments. Within the past two decades hormetic dose responses have been frequently reported in the experimental biogerontology literature, associated with endpoints associated enhancing healthy aging and longevity. The low dose stimulatory response of the hormetic dose response model represents the quantification of enhanced biological performance in the experimental facilitation of aging quality via multiple endpoints and mechanisms and in the extension of lifespan in such animal models research.",

While on average deficits accumulate with age, individual trajectories in the number of deficits is highly dynamic.

Previously, we found the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR) was increased in excitation by a dopamine receptor antagonist. If this airway-protective reflex is similarly affected by aging, it will interfere with volitional control in older adults. The current study tested whether the LAR was affected by aging, and whether such deficits were reversed by levodopa administration in aging rats. We recorded thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle activity at rest and during elicitation of LAR responses by stimulation of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (iSLN) in 6-, 18- and 30-month-old rats under alpha-chloralose anesthesia. Using paired stimuli at different inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs), LAR central conditioning, resting muscle activity, and reflex latency and amplitudes were quantified. Numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) were measured using tyrosine hydroxylase staining. We found: (1) increased resting TA muscle activity and LAR amplitude occurred with fewer dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc in 18- and 30-month-old rats; (2) decreases in LAR latency and increases in amplitude correlated with reduced numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc; (3) test responses were greater at 1000\u00a0ms ISI in 18-month-old rats compared with 6-month-old rats; and (4) levodopa administration further increased response latency but did not alter muscle activity, response amplitude, or central conditioning. In conclusion, increases in laryngeal muscle activity levels and reflex amplitudes accompanied age reductions in dopaminergic neurons but were not reversed with levodopa administration.",

Based on the individual scores for each fitness item, a Z-score was created.

A negative association was found between the composite Z-score for functional fitness and the sedentary time, even adjusting for MVPA and other confounders. On the other hand, MVPA was positively associated with the composite Z-score for functional fitness, independently of the sedentary time. In conclusion elderly who spend more time in physical activity or less time in sedentary behaviors exhibit improved functional fitness and other confounders.

     "abstract": "Although slow myofibers are considered less susceptible to atrophy with aging, slow fiber atrophy may have been underestimated previously. First, the marked atrophy of the aging rat soleus (Sol) muscle cannot be explained by the atrophy of only the fast fibers, due to their low abundance. Second, the increase in small fibers co-expressing both fast and slow myosin heavy chains (MHC) in the aging rat Sol is proportional to a decline in pure MHC slow fibers (Snow et al., 2005), suggesting that these MHC co-expressing fibers represent formerly pure slow fibers. Thus, we examined the size and proportion of MHC slow, MHC fast, and MHC fast-slow co-expressing fibers in the Sol and mixed region of the gastrocnemius (Gas) muscle in young adult (YA) and senescent (SEN) rats. Our results suggest that formerly pure MHC slow fibers are the source of MHC co-expressing fibers with aging in both muscle regions. Accounting for the atrophy of these fibers in calculating MHC slow fiber atrophy with aging revealed that MHC slow fibers atrophy on average by 40% in the Sol and by 38% in the mixed Gas, values which are similar to the 60% and 31% atrophy of pure MHC fast fibers in the Sol and mixed Gas, respectively. Probing for the atrophy-dependent ubiquitin ligase, MAFbx (atrogin 1), it was suggested that former slow fibers acquire atrophy potential via the up-regulation of MAFbx coincident with the co-expression of fast MHC. These results redefine the impact of aging on slow fiber atrophy, and emphasize the necessity of addressing the atrophy of fast and slow fibers in seeking treatments for aging muscle atrophy.",

Sirtuin 1 modulates mitochondrial biogenesis, primarily via its ability to deacetylate and activate proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), interacting with AMPK kinase. Redox cell status can also influence this regulatory axis and together they form an important convergence point in hormesis during the aging process. Here, we tested whether treadmill training (36\u00a0weeks), as a paradigm of long-term moderate exercise, modifies the AMPK\u2013sirtuin 1\u2013PGC-1\u03b1 axis and redox balance in rat gastrocnemius muscle, liver and heart. Physical activity induced increases in sirtuin 1 protein levels in all the aged rat tissues studied, as well as total PGC-1\u03b1 levels. However, no changes in AMPK activation or significant differences in mitochondrial biogenesis (by measuring electron transport chain protein content) were found after exercise training. Parallel to these changes, we observed an improvement of oxidative stress defenses, mainly in muscle, with modification of the antioxidant enzyme machinery resulting in a reduction in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation. Thus, we demonstrate that moderate long-term exercise promotes tissue adaptations, increasing muscle, liver and heart sirtuin 1 protein content and activity and increasing PGC-1\u03b1 protein expression. However, AMPK activation or mitochondrial biogenesis is not modified, but it cannot be discarded that its participation in the adaptive mechanism which prevents the development of the deleterious effects of age.",

     "abstract": "Aging research was hindered because of the long lifespan of available vertebrates. Annual fishes of Nothobranchius have become a new model organism for aging studies. Resveratrol, a natural plant-derived chemical, prolongs lifespan in many animals. Here we used the wild strain of N. guentheri, which has the mean lifespan of 12\u00a0months, to detect the effects of resveratrol on the longevity, cognitive ability and aging-related histological markers. Our results showed that the pharmaceutical treatment of resveratrol prolonged the lifespan of N. guentheri but did not affect their body size. Three behavioral assays for cognitive ability and locomotor activity demonstrated that the resveratrol-treated fish exhibited the higher rate of performances than the fish in the control group. Further data indicated that resveratrol not only had the property of protecting N. guentheri from neurodegeneration, but retarded the aging-related histological markers in lipofuscin formation and in the expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity.",

     "abstract": "The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the rise. CKD patients are at high risk of cardiovascular (CVD) and all-cause mortality. CKD patients have several endocrine disorders, including low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). In the general population, low levels of DHEA-S are associated with high CVD and all-cause mortality. The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of plasma DHEA-S on the survival of CKD patients on hemodialysis.This was a single-center prospective cohort study on two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis, which assessed the prognostic value of plasma DHEA-S on their survival.We found that plasma DHEA-S levels were negatively associated with age, and positively associated with dialysis duration and plasma creatinine, albumin, and phosphate levels in hemodialysis men. Elderly patients with co-morbidities (i.e. diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), poorer fluid control which was evaluated by higher cardiothoracic ratio, and low plasma creatinine and albumin levels seemed to have poor prognosis in hemodialysis men. Furthermore, low plasma DHEA-S levels were significantly associated with CVD-related [hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a03.877; P\u00a0=\u00a00.021], non-CVD-related (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.522; P\u00a0=\u00a00.016), and all-cause mortality (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.667; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) in hemodialysis men. But low plasma DHEA-S levels were not significantly associated with CVD-related, non-CVD-related, and all-cause mortality in hemodialysis women. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that low plasma DHEA-S levels are significantly and independently associated with all-cause mortality in hemodialysis men (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.933; P\u00a0=\u00a00.033).The study suggested that low plasma DHEA-S was independently and significantly associated with all-cause mortality in CKD hemodialysis men.",

     "publication date": "12-2012",
     "abstract": "Rapamycin, a potent immunomodulatory drug, has shown promise in the amelioration of numerous age-associated diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's disease and cardiac hypertrophy. Yet the elderly, the population most likely to receive therapeutic rapamycin, are already at increased risk for infectious disease; thus concern exists that rapamycin may exacerbate age-associated immune dysfunctions and worsen infection outcomes. Herein, we examined the impact of enteric delivered rapamycin monotherapy (eRapa) on the susceptibility of aged (22\u201324\u00a0month) C57BL/6 mice to Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Following challenge with S. pneumoniae, administration of eRapa conferred modest protection against mortality. Reduced mortality was the result of diminished lung damage rather than reduced bacterial burden. eRapa had no effect on basal levels of Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, KC, Interferon-\u03b3, Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in whole lung homogenates or during pneumococcal pneumonia. Previously we have demonstrated that cellular senescence enhances permissiveness for bacterial pneumonia through increased expression of the bacterial ligands Laminin receptor (LR), Platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFr) and Cytokeratin 10 (K10). These proteins are co-opted by S. pneumoniae and other respiratory tract pathogens for host cell attachment during lung infection. UM-HET3 mice on eRapa had reduced lung cellular senescence as determined by levels of the senescence markers p21 and pRB, but not mH2A.1. Mice on eRapa also had marked reductions in PAFr, LR, and K10. We conclude that eRapa protected aged mice against pneumonia through reduced lung cellular senescence, which in turn, lowered bacterial ligand expression.",

Hearing thresholds, the strength of the acoustic startle responses (ASRs) to noise and tonal stimuli, and the efficiency of the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of ASR were assessed in young-adult, middle-aged, and aged rats of both strains. Compared with LE rats, F344 rats showed larger age-related hearing threshold shifts, and the amplitudes of their startle responses were mostly lower. Both rat strains demonstrated a significant decrease of startle reactivity during aging. For tonal stimuli, this decrease occurred at an earlier age in the F344 rats: middle-aged F344 animals expressed similar startle reactivity as aged F344 animals, whereas middle-aged LE animals had similar startle reactivity as young-adult LE animals. For noise stimuli, on the other hand, a similar progression of age-related ASR changes was found in both strains. No significant relationship between the hearing thresholds and the ASR amplitudes was found within any age group. Auditory PPI was less efficient in F344 rats than in LE rats. An age-related reduction of the PPI of ASR was observed in rats of both strains; however, a significant reduction of PPI occurred only in aged rats. The results indicate that the ASR may serve as an indicator of central presbycusis.",

The erythrocyte membranes of the supplement group showed a significant increase in eicosapentenoic acid, docosapentenoic acid and DHA concentrations and a significant decrease in arachidonic acid, malondialdehyde and lipofuscin levels. These changes in membrane composition resulted in an increase in the unsaturation index, membrane fluidity and acetylcholine esterase activity. Moreover, a significant increase in the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione was observed in the erythrocyte of the supplement group.Although this study is a preliminary investigation, we believe these findings to be of great speculative and interpretative interest to better understand the complex and multi-factorial mechanisms behind the possible links between diets, their functional components and possible molecular processes that contribute to increasing the risk of developing MCI and Alzheimer's.",

Our investigation was focused on the effects of cordycepin (3\u2032-deoxyadenosine) on lipid peroxidation and antioxidation in aged rats. Age-associated decline in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C and vitamin E, and elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were observed in the liver, kidneys, heart and lungs of aged rats, when compared to young rats. Furthermore, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), urea, and creatinine were found to be significantly elevated in aged rats compared to young rats. Aged rats receiving cordycepin treatment show increased activity of SOD, CAT, GPx, GR and GST, and elevated levels of GSH, and vitamins C and E such that the values of most of these parameters did not differ significantly from those found in young rats. In addition, the levels of MDA, AST, ALT, urea and creatinine became reduced upon administration of cordycepin to aged rats. These results suggest that cordycepin is effective for restoring antioxidant status and decreasing lipid peroxidation in aged rats.",

     "abstract": "Insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) plays a crucial role in the regulation of insulin signaling. Several polymorphisms of the gene encoding IRS2 have been identified. The variant causing Gly1057Asp substitution is relatively frequent in humans and its impact on insulin sensitivity seems to be dependent on age and body weight. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationships between Gly1057Asp variant and insulin sensitivity assessed by HOMA, and adiposity evaluated by measurement of epicardial fat (EpiF) thickness in the elderly. We studied 87 subjects, 42 men and 45 women, mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 74.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.24\u00a0years.

Univariate linear regression analyses evidenced that HOMA index was correlated with BMI (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.152, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), fasting plasma glucose (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.018, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), LDL cholesterol (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.008, p\u00a0=\u00a00.024), total cholesterol (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.007, p\u00a0=\u00a00.039), weight (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.054, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), presence of Gly1057Asp variant (beta\u00a0=\u00a01.185, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and EpiF thickness (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.540, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In multivariate analysis HOMA index was still associated with the presence of the Gly1057Asp variant of the IRS-2 gene (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.568, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and with EpiF thickness (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.414, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Furthermore, a statistically significant positive correlation between EpiF thickness and HOMA was found (r\u00a0=\u00a00.773, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and this was not different between wild type control subjects and carriers of Gly1057Asp variant of the IRS2 gene (p\u00a0=\u00a00.718). Similar results were obtained in comparing subjects with normal fasting glucose levels. In conclusion, in our elderly subjects the presence of the allelic variant Gly1057Asp of IRS2 gene was associated to the degree of insulin resistance assessed by HOMA index and with EpiF thickness, independently from the extent of obesity, suggesting its contribution to global cardiometabolic risk.",

     "abstract": "The diagnosis of vascular dementia (VaD) describes a group of various vessel disorders with different types of vascular lesions that finally contribute to the development of dementia. Most common forms of VaD in the elderly brain are subcortical vascular encephalopathy, strategic infarct dementia, and the multi infarct encephalopathy. Hereditary forms of VaD are rare. Most common is the cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Sporadic forms of VaD are caused by degenerative vessel disorders such as atherosclerosis, small vessel disease (SVD) including small vessel arteriosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and lipohyalinosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Less frequently inflammatory vessel disorders and tumor-associated vessel lesions (e.g. angiocentric T-cell or angiotropic large cell lymphoma) can cause symptoms of dementia. Here, we review and discuss the impact of vessel disorders to distinct vascular brain tissue lesions and to the development of dementia in elderly individuals. The impact of coexisting neurodegenerative pathology in the elderly brain to VaD as well as the correlation between SVD and CAA expansion in the brain parenchyma with that of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology is highlighted. We conclude that \u201cpure\u201d VaD is rare and most frequently caused by infarctions. However, there is a significant contribution of vascular lesions and vessel pathology to the development of dementia that may go beyond tissue damage due to vascular lesions. Insufficient blood blow and alterations of the perivascular drainage mechanisms of the brain may also lead to a reduced protein clearance from extracellular space and subsequent increase of proteins in the brain parenchyma, such as the amyloid \u03b2-protein, and foster, thereby, the development of AD-related neurodegeneration. As such, it seems to be important for clinical practice to consider treatment of potentially coexisting AD pathology in cognitively impaired patients with vascular lesions.",

     "abstract": "Here, we summarise the results after carrying out a large survey regarding the assessment of vascular alterations, both vessel changes and vascular lesions in an inter-laboratory setting. In total, 32 neuropathologists from 22 centres, most being members of BrainNet Europe (BNE), participated by filling out a questionnaire with emphasis on assessment of common vascular alterations seen in the brains of aged subjects. A certain level of harmonisation has been reached among BNE members regarding sectioning of the brain, harvesting of brain tissue for histology and staining used when compared to the survey carried out in 2006 by Pantoni and colleagues. The most significant variability was seen regarding the assessment of severity and of clinical significance of vascular alterations. Two strategies have recently been recommended regarding the assessment of vascular alterations in aged and demented subjects. The National Institute on Aging \u2014 Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) recommends the assessment of hippocampal sclerosis, vascular brain injury and microvascular lesions in 12 regions. Although this strategy will be easy to follow, the recommendations do not inform how the load of observed alterations should be assessed and when the observed lesions are of significance. Deramecourt and his colleagues recommend an assessment and semiquantitative grading of various pathologies in 4 brain regions. This strategy yielded a total score of 0 to 20 as an estimate of pathology load. It is, however, not clear which score is considered to be of clinical significance. Furthermore, in several BNE trials the semiquantitative assessment has yielded poor agreement rates; an observation that might negatively influence the strategy proposed by Deramecourt and his colleagues. In line with NIA-AA, a dichotomised approach of easily recognisable lesions in a standardised set of brain regions harvested for neuropathological assessment and applying reproducible sampling and staining strategies is recommended by BNE. However, a simple strategy regarding assessment of load of alteration is urgently needed to yield reproducible, and at the same time, comparable results between centres.",

Meta-analyses have in general not found an association between blood pressure lowering and reduced dementia incidence, although the number of cases reported in the placebo controlled trials is invariably lower in the actively treated group.

The recent genomegenome wide association study on white matter lesions identified a novel locus on chromosome 17q25 harboring several genes such as TRIM65 and TRIM47 which pinpoints to possible novel mechanisms leading to these lesions.",

     "abstract": "Although the precise culprit in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is still obscure, defective mitochondria functioning has been proposed to be an upstream event in AD. Mitochondria fulfill a number of essential cellular functions, and it is recognized that the strict regulation of the structure, function and turnover of these organelles is an immutable control node for the maintenance of neuronal and vascular homeostasis. Extensive research in postmortem brain tissue from AD subjects, and AD animal and cellular models revealed that mitochondria undergo multiple malfunctions during the course of this disease. The present review summarizes the current views on how mitochondria are implicated in both AD-related neuronal and cerebrovascular degeneration. The understanding of the mitochondrial mechanisms underlying AD pathology is critical to design more effective strategies to halt or delay disease progression.",

     "abstract": "Many animals are characterized by declining brain function at advanced ages, including honeybees (Apis mellifera). Variation in honeybee social development, moreover, results in individual differences in the progression of aging that may be accelerated, delayed, and sometimes reversed by changes in behavior. Here, we combine manipulations of social development with a measurement of sensory sensitivity, Pavlovian (associative) learning, and a proteomic technique to study the brain of aged honeybees. First, we confirm that sensory sensitivity can remain intact during aging, and that age-associated learning deficits are specific to bees that forage, a behavior typically expressed after a period of nursing activity. These initial data go beyond previous findings by showing how foragers age in social groups of different age compositions and sizes. Thereafter, we establish that learning ability can recover in aged foragers that revert to nursing tasks. Finally, we use liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS2) to describe proteomic differences between central brains, from reverted former foragers that varied in recovery of learning performance, and from nurse bees that varied in learning ability but never foraged. We find that recovery is positively associated with levels of stress response/cellular maintenance proteins in the central brain, while variation in learning before aging is negatively associated with the amounts of metabolic enzymes in the brain tissue. Our work provides the strongest evidence, thus far, for reversibility of learning deficits in aged honeybees, and indicates that recovery-related brain plasticity is connected to cellular stress resilience, maintenance and repair processes.",

The design included multiple age groups with initially similar genetic structure, which made it possible to separate age effects from period effects and to identify the genetic component to variation in life span. During a period of stress, individuals of all ages showed parallel increases in mortality but different cohorts experienced this period of high mortality at different ages. This then influenced the distribution of life spans across cohorts. Age and size-age interactions influenced mortality during the period of stress. Smaller individuals died but only if they were old. Additionally, growth and age interacted with stress such that older individuals had negative growth and high mortality whereas younger individuals had positive growth and relatively lower mortality during stress. The results of this study show that it is not simply the environment that can have a major impact on demography in natural populations; rather, age, size and growth can interact with the environment to influence mortality and life span when the environment is stressful.",

How much of the variation is inherently related to some qualities of the individual, and how much is entirely random? How much of the randomness is cumulative, and how much is merely short-term flutter?We propose that recent lines of statistical inquiry in survival analysis could usefully grapple with these questions, all the more so if they were more explicitly linked to the relevant mathematical and biological models of aging. To this end, we describe points of contact among the various lines of mathematical and statistical research.

Although most primates are social, humans are highly cooperative and social in ways that likely co-evolved with the slow human life history. In this paper we highlight the role of resource transfers and non-material assistance within and across generations in shaping low human mortality rates. The use of complex cooperative strategies to minimize risk is a necessary precursor for selecting further reductions in mortality rate in late adulthood. In conjunction with changes in the age-profile of production, the impacts of resource transfers and other forms of cooperation on reducing mortality likely played an important role in selection on post-reproductive lifespan throughout human evolution. Using medical data and ethnographic interviews, we explore several types of common risks experienced by Tsimane forager\u2013horticulturalists, and quantify the types and targets of aid.

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of physical geographic factors and climate conditions on human longevity. The centenarian rate (CR) in 2005 was computed for Japan's 47 prefectures, whose geography and climate vary greatly. Several pathways, such as excess winter mortality, land use and agricultural production, possibly linking physical and climate factors with extreme longevity, were explored. The probability of becoming a centenarian varies significantly among the Japanese prefectures. In particular, the computation of CR70 demonstrated that the actual probability for individuals 70\u00a0years old in 1975 of becoming centenarians in 2005 was 3 times higher, on average, in Okinawa, both for males and females, than in Japan as a whole. About three quarters of the variance in CR70 for females and half for males is explained by the physical environment and land use, even when variations in the level of socio-economic status between prefectures are controlled. Our analysis highlighted two features which might have played an important role in the longevity observed in Okinawa. First, there is virtually no winter in Okinawa. For instance, the mean winter temperature observed in 2005 was 17.2\u00a0\u00b0C. Second, today, there is almost no rice production in Okinawa compared to other parts of Japan. In the past, however, production was higher in Okinawa. If we consider that long term effects of harsh winters can contribute to the mortality differential in old age and if we consider that food availability in the first part of the 20th century was mainly dependent on local production, early 20th century birth cohorts in Okinawa clearly had different experiences in terms of winter conditions and in terms of food availability compared to their counterparts in other parts of Japan. This work confirms the impact of climate conditions on human longevity, but it fails to demonstrate a strong association between longevity and mountainous regions and/or air quality.",

     "abstract": "Left ventricular (LV) relaxation is influenced by vascular loads imposed on the heart. The current study investigated the influence of the timing and magnitude of arterial wave reflection on LV isovolumic pressure relaxation, with a specific focus on the aging process. Fisher 344 rats aged 6, 18, and 24\u00a0months were anesthetized and thoracotomized. Arterial wave reflection was characterized by wave transit time (\u03c4w) and wave reflection factor (Rf) using the impulse response of the filtered aortic input impedance spectra. Indices of LV pressure relaxation included peak \u2013dPLV/dt and the isovolumic relaxation time constant (\u03c4e). The vascular dynamic condition in the rats was characterized by (1) a progressive increase in Rf and decrease in \u03c4w associated with age, especially at 24\u00a0months; and (2) a decline in aortic compliance (Cm). Changes in LV relaxation consisted of a fall in peak \u2013dPLV/dt and a rise in LV \u03c4e with age. Taking LV \u03c4e as the dependent variable and arterial Rf and \u03c4w as the two independent variables, multiple linear regression was employed to fit the data. The correlation among the three parameters reached significance (\u03c4e =\u00a011.885\u00a0+\u00a05.350\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Rf\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.213\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\u03c4w; r\u00a0=\u00a00.5823, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This finding indicated that as arterial \u03c4w shortened and arterial Rf was augmented with age, LV \u03c4e became more prolonged and late pressure relaxation slowed. Thus, the heavy reflection intensity with early return of the pulse wave reflection might account for the age-related deterioration in LV isovolumic pressure decay.",

Within each age category, 40 rats were divided into four treatment groups: 1) control, 2) hindlimb suspended (unloaded), 3) prehabilitative conditioning preceding hindlimb suspension, and 4) pre-habilitative conditioning alone. Cytofluorescent staining was used to visualize NMJs, and histochemical staining to assess myofiber profiles (size and type). Statistical analysis featured 2-way ANOVA with main effects for age and treatment, along with interaction. NMJs consistently revealed significant (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) main effects for age, but not treatment, or interaction. Typically, aged NMJs showed elongated nerve terminal branching, and more dispersed post-synaptic clusters of ACh receptors, resulting in reduced post-synaptic area per given length of pre-synaptic branching. Analysis of myofiber profiles showed significant main effects for age, treatment, and their interaction. Aged myofibers were smaller than the young ones and a higher percentage of them were Type I. Aged fibers experienced significantly greater unloading-induced atrophy than the young ones. Pre-habilitative conditioning significantly attenuated unloading-induced atrophy among aged, but not young myofibers. It was also observed that pre-habilitative conditioning alone increased myofiber size among aged, but not young adult muscles. In summary, myofibers were more sensitive than NMJs to the treatment interventions implemented. Although more sensitive to the negative effects of muscle unloading, aged myofibers were also more responsive to the hypertrophic effects of pre-habilitative conditioning.",

The extent to which these age changes differ by sex further contributes to this understanding but has not been well studied to date. We conducted a systematic examination of dynamics and heterogeneity of age changes in cancer mortality rates for the top 14 cancer sites using vital statistics from the NCHS and SEER between 1969 and 2007. We assessed patterns of age changes in site-specific mortality rates in terms of both increase (age slope) and acceleration (change in age slope) as measured by the log\u2013log acceleration rate (LLA). We assessed sex differences in mortality rates through sex mortality rate ratios and sex differences in age changes through comparisons of the LLA by sex. The logged male-to-female mortality ratios are positive but vary substantially with age in magnitude. And the age patterns of sex ratios also vary across sites. The LLA values show similar declines and hence slowdowns of mortality increment into or during old age for both sexes for most sites and periods. Post-reproductive changes in sex differences in cancer mortality are not entirely consistent with the estrogenic hypothesis about the anticarcinogenic effects of sex hormones and suggest the utility of the multistage model of disease progression for some tumor sites. Analysis of age dynamics and sex differences in cancer mortality may modify extant aging-related theories of carcinogenesis and frame future searches for specific explanatory factors.",

The antioxidative enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GRd) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) play a crucial role protecting the organism against the age-dependent oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is present in nearly all living cells. GSH is one of the main antioxidants in the cell and it serves several physiological functions. Our purpose was to evaluate the age-related changes in mitochondrial GPx, GRd and SOD activities, and mitochondrial GSH pool in the brains of young (3\u00a0months) and aged rats (24\u00a0months). We also investigated whether melatonin administration influences these brain mitochondrial enzyme activities and GSH levels in young and aged rats. The results showed that GPx activity increased with age, whereas melatonin treatment decreased GPx activity in the aged rats at levels similar to those in young and young\u00a0+\u00a0melatonin groups. The activities of GRd and SOD, however, did not change with age. But, melatonin treatment increased SOD activity in the aged rats. GSH levels, which also increased with age, were not modified by melatonin treatment. The reduction in the SOD/GPx and GR/GPx ratios with age was prevented by melatonin administration. Together, our results suggest that the age-related oxidative stress in rat brain mitochondria is more apparent when the antioxidant enzyme ratios are analyzed instead of their absolute values. The antioxidative effects of melatonin were also supported by the recovery of the enzyme ratios during aging.",

Consequently, a large number of putative antioxidant compounds are freely available in myriad formulations that are often not tested for their efficacy or regulated for quality control. Following the development of a Drosophila model of oxidative-stress dependent aging (p38 MAP K (p38K) mutants) in our laboratory, we attempted to test the protective effect of some of these commonly available formulations against oxidative stress, in the p38K model. As environmental exposure to oxidizing toxins has been linked to a variety of human diseases, we also tested the efficacy of these supplements on chemically-induced models of oxidative stress (paraquat and hydrogen peroxide exposure). Our results suggest that when added as a dietary supplement, some of these over-the-counter compounds, notably containing a\u00e7ai extracts, confer significant protection for both the p38K-dependent genetic model as well as the toxin-induced model. These products were also remarkably effective at dampening stress-induced expression of the detoxifying enzyme GSTD1 and eliminating paraquat induced circadian rhythm deficits. Overall, our results suggest potential benefits of dietary supplementation with some of these compounds, especially under conditions of elevated oxidative stress. These findings should be assessed in the context of other studies that seek to identify active principles in these extracts, determine their effective dosage for human consumption and evaluate the safety of long-term prophylactic applications.",

Twelve months later, implanted and unimplanted mice were assessed for long-term survival of NPC, for cognitive function, hippocampal cell density, and the presence of extracellular tau accumulation. Implantation of NPC in trisomic mice improved learning and memory as assessed by conditioned taste aversion testing, but not on the novel object recognition task. Trisomic mice given saline control injections improved performance on both cognitive tasks compared to unimplanted trisomic mice. In contrast, disomic mice, implanted with either saline or NPC, were impaired in both tasks. Long-term surviving NPC were found in 7 out of 11 disomic brains and 4 out of 5 trisomic brains, with an average survival rate of 3.1% and 5.9% respectively. Extracellular tau aggregations were elevated in trisomic mice, but implantation with NPC was associated with significantly fewer aggregations. This was also seen in disomic mice. Saline injections significantly elevated tau presence in both karyotypes. Based on these results, we conclude that the modest effects of a few surviving NPC cannot be distinguished from those induced by the implant procedure. However, the changes prompted by neonatal treatment were detectable in aged animals. Collectively, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that neonatal therapeutic intervention in DS has the potential to exert positive lasting effects in the later stages of life but that NPC or the implantation approach may not be the most effective strategy and alternative stem cell types or delivery systems merit further investigation.",

     "abstract": "Endothelial vasodilation in human vessels is impaired by aging and other cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) but the differential impact of aging and CVRF in human endothelial function is not completely elucidated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of aging on the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b1 and -\u03b3 subtype agonists on endothelium-dependent vasodilation of isolated human vessels from subjects with or without CVRF. Human mesenteric microarteries were dissected from omentum specimens obtained from subjects younger or older than 60\u00a0years having or not CVRF and mounted in wire myographs to evaluate endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin (BK). Aging and CVRF independently reduced endothelium-dependent relaxations. An additional impairment was produced when aging and CVRF co-existed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In vessels from adult subjects PPAR\u03b3 agonist, GW1929 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) improved BK-induced responses only in those obtained from subjects with CVRF. By contrast, GW1929 improved the responses in vessels from elderly subjects having or not CVRF. PPAR\u03b1 agonist, GW7647 (1\u00a0\u03bcM), enhanced endothelial vasodilation in adults with CVRF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but lack any effect in vessels from older subjects having or not CVRF. In vessels from subjects with CVRF, superoxide dismutase (SOD; 100\u00a0U/ml) improved BK-induced responses only in elderly subjects (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Vascular aging negatively impacts endothelial function independently of the presence of additional CVRF through specific molecular mechanisms involving superoxide generation. While PPAR\u03b3 activation remains effective, the improving effects of PPAR\u03b1 agonists on endothelial responses disappear in aged human vessels.",

The salivary (but not the serum derived) neutrophils of individuals with DS were found to have an increased expression of CD69 regardless of the age of the patient compared to patients without DS. However, these salivary neutrophils had a lower expression of CD66b and CD64. Expression of TLR2 was lower on the salivary- and serum-derived neutrophils from elderly individuals compared to the neutrophils of younger subjects, regardless of whether the individual had DS. Salivary interleukin (IL)-4 was elevated in both of the elderly subject groups (with or without DS). Only elderly DS patients were observed to have increased serum IL-4 levels and reduced salivary IL-12 levels. Younger DS patients showed an increase in salivary IL-10 levels, and both the saliva and the serum levels of IFN-\u03b3 were increased in all of the younger subjects.

     "abstract": "The immune system undergoes profound age-related changes, including a gradual increase in the production and circulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Despite the known capacity of fibroblasts to produce cytokines, little is known so far about the inflammatory response of fibroblasts to cellular stress such as viral and/or bacterial infection in the context of aging. Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze the levels of IL6 and IL8 secretion in supernatants of human skin fibroblasts from young and elderly persons. Cytokine and chemokine secretion was analyzed before and after in vitro infection of the cells with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and/or stimulation with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The exposure of fibroblasts to these agents caused inflammatory changes, reflected by the secretion of both the cytokine IL6 and the chemokine IL8 by fibroblasts from young as well as elderly persons. The cytokine/chemokine production induced by either agent alone could be further increased by co-stimulation of the cells with both stimuli. The level of protein secretion was dependent on the chronological age of the fibroblasts. Stimulated human skin fibroblasts from elderly donors produced higher amounts of IL6 as well as IL8 than fibroblasts from young donors. These differences were more pronounced for IL6 than for IL8. The inflammatory response of fibroblasts to stimulation differed among donors and did not correspond to the responsiveness of whole blood derived from the same person.In summary lifelong CMV-infection may act as an in vivo trigger for inflammatory changes by increasing the inflammatory response to bacterial products such as LPS. It may thus contribute to age-related inflammatory processes, referred to as \u2018inflamm-aging\u2019.",

     "abstract": "Regular exercise improves the age-related decline in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and is associated with improved cognitive function; however, less is known about the direct relationship between CBF and cognitive function. We examined the influence of healthy aging on the capability of acute exercise to improve cognition, and whether exercise-induced improvements in cognition are related to CBF and cortical hemodynamics. Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv; Doppler) and cortical hemodynamics (NIRS) were measured in 13 young (24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 y) and 9 older (62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 y) participants at rest and during cycling at 30% and 70% of heart rate range (HRR). Cognitive performance was assessed using a computer-adapted Stroop task (i.e., test of executive function cognition) at rest and during exercise. Average response times on the Stroop task were slower for the older compared to younger group for both simple and difficult tasks (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Independent of age, difficult-task response times improved during exercise (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), with the improvement greater at 70% HRR exercise (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04 vs. 30% HRR). Higher MCAv was correlated with faster response times for simple and difficult tasks at rest (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.47 and R2\u00a0=\u00a00.47, respectively), but this relation uncoupled progressively during exercise. Exercise-induced increases in MCAv were similar and unaltered during cognitive tasks for both age groups. In contrast, prefrontal cortical hemodynamic NIRS measures [oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and total hemoglobin (tHb)] were differentially affected by exercise intensity, age and cognitive task; e.g., there were smaller increases in [O2Hb] and [tHb] in the older group between exercise intensities (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These data indicate that: 1) Regardless of age, cognitive (executive) function is improved while exercising; 2) while MCAv is strongly related to cognition at rest, this relation becomes uncoupled during exercise, and 3) there is dissociation between global CBF and regional cortical oxygenation and NIRS blood volume markers during exercise and engagement of prefrontal cognition.",

     "abstract": "The prevalence of depression increases with aging. We hypothesized that like humans, old animals exhibit anhedonic-like behavior, along with signs of behavioral despair. In rodents, anhedonia, a reduced sensitivity to reward, which is listed as a core feature of major depression in the DSM-IVR, can be measured by a decrease in intake of and preference for sweet solutions. Here, sucrose intake, forced swimming, immobility in the modified tail suspension test, novelty exploration, grooming, anxiety and locomotor activity were compared in na\u00efve 3- and 18-month-old male C57BL/6 mice. The absolute amounts and the ratio of consumed 1% sucrose solution to water intake was significantly smaller in 18-month-old mice than in 3-month-old mice. The consumption of 5%-sucrose solution requiring high levels of drinking effort, novelty exploration in two setups and grooming behavior in the splash test were reduced in older animals. Analysis of other behaviors suggested that the above-mentioned signs of anhedonic-like traits were unlikely to be attributable to the potential effect of aging on metabolic needs for water, taste perception, motor capabilities or the induction of essential anxiety and neophobia. A 4-week treatment with the antidepressant imipramine (7\u00a0mg/kg/day) or dimebon, a compound with suggested neuroprotective proneurogenic properties (1\u00a0mg/kg/day) restored sucrose intake and preference in 18-month-old mice. Meanwhile, young and old mice showed no differences in the parameters of behavioral despair evaluated in the forced swim and modified tail suspension tests. Thus, the behavioral profile of aged mice parallels that of humans with elderly depression, in whom the symptoms of hedonic deficits typically outweigh affective disturbances. The assessment of anhedonic-like traits with the sucrose preference test in 18-month-old mice will be useful in preclinical studies of elderly depression.",

     "abstract": "Increased lifespan can be associated with greater resistance to many different stressors, most notably thermal stress. Such hormetic effects have also been found in C. elegans where short-term exposure to heat lengthens the lifespan. Genetic investigations have been carried out using mutation perturbations in a single genotype, the wild type Bristol N2. Yet, induced mutations do not yield insight regarding the natural genetic variation of thermal tolerance and lifespan. We investigated the genetic variation of heat-shock recovery, i.e. hormetic effects on lifespan and associated quantitative trait loci (QTL) in C. elegans. Heat-shock resulted in an 18% lifespan increase in wild type CB4856 whereas N2 did not show a lifespan elongation. Using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between wild types N2 and CB4856 we found natural variation in stress-response hormesis in lifespan. Approx. 28% of the RILs displayed a hormesis effect in lifespan. We did not find any hormesis effects for total offspring. Across the RILs there was no relation between lifespan and offspring. The ability to recover from heat-shock mapped to a significant QTL on chromosome II which overlapped with a QTL for offspring under heat-shock conditions. The QTL was confirmed by introgressing relatively small CB4856 regions into chromosome II of N2. Our observations show that there is natural variation in hormetic effects on C. elegans lifespan for heat-shock and that this variation is genetically determined.",

In the present study we examined the effects of age on vastus lateralis (VL) muscle fiber-type composition, fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), and MHC isoforms expressed in 4 young and 4 older adult vervet monkeys. Proteomics analysis, using a human and nonhuman primate protein database, showed five MHC isoforms (I, IIA, IIX, IIB, and IIB\u2032) expressed in female vervet VL muscle, which matched the human MHC isoforms. Fast type II fibers predominated and no pure type IIB or IIB\u2019 containing fibers were detected. Hybrid fibers containing IIB/IIB\u2019 MHC decreased in the old vervets. The CSA of both type I and type II fibers was significantly smaller in older vervet while type IIA fibers showed the most severity of atrophy. The decrease of fast MHC and atrophy of muscle fiber with aging recapitulate observations in human VL muscle. These findings, along with its homology of MHC between the vervet and human suggested that the vervet monkey may be a suitable preclinical model for understanding the cellular and molecular basis of sarcopenia and for developing new interventions to ameliorate the impact of disorders that affect skeletal muscle structure and function.",

The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was used to differentiate between healthy and mobility limited older adults. Functional task performance was assessed using multiple chair rise and stair climb tests. Leg extensor force (torque), but not maximal contraction velocity, was significantly associated with muscle power in MH. Both torque and velocity were significantly associated with muscle power in OH. Maximal velocity, but not torque, was associated with power in OML. Maximal velocity demonstrated an association with multiple chair rise time and stair climb time in OML, but not MH or OH. It is concluded that movement velocity is an increasingly important determinant of maximal power output with advancing age. Furthermore, movement velocity is also a critical component of functional task performance with aging and may contribute to functional deficits. These findings help to explain why the rate-dependent variable power has emerged as a critical component of both assessment and rehabilitation of muscular performance and physical function in older adults.",

Animal models are frequently used to investigate the underlying pathophysiology. Only scarce data regarding the effect of aging on calcifications in these animal models are available. The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence of cardiovascular calcifications in normal, aging rats.A mixed inbred/outbred population of 44 male Lewis/Wistar rats was studied. Group 1 of three-month-old rats, group 2 twelve-month-old, group 3 twenty-four-month-old and group 4 thirty-month-old rats. Calibrated integrated backscatter (cIB) values and blood parameters (creatinine, parathyroid hormone (PTH)) were measured, followed by ex-vivo micro-CT and histology as reference methods.Cardiovascular calcifications developed with age, as demonstrated by significantly increasing cIB values of the aortic valve and myocardium. This was confirmed by a significant increase in the calcified volume on ex-vivo micro-CT and in the histological calcium score. There was also a significantly higher level of creatinine and PTH with age.As in humans, cardiovascular calcifications progressively increase with age in the normal rat. Therefore the aging rat model could be used for studying calcifying cardiovascular disease. cIB might have a value in future studies for the early detection of subclinical calcifications in humans.",

We tested the hypothesis that the impact of 6\u00a0weeks of detraining (DT) subsequent to 12\u00a0weeks of high-speed power training on maximal strength (1RM) of the arm and leg muscles, power performance (counter movement jump and ball throwing) and functional task (sit-to-stand test) would decrease physical performance, and specifically power performance.Thirty-seven older women were divided into an experimental group and a control group [EG, n\u00a0=\u00a020, 65.8 (2.5) years; CG: n\u00a0=\u00a017, 64.8 (2.8) years]. Muscular strength, power and functional testings were conducted before the initiation of training (T1), after 12\u00a0weeks (T2) and after 6\u00a0weeks of DT (T3).During the 12\u00a0weeks of training, EG significantly increased their dynamic strength performance (range from 41.9 to 64.1%), muscle power output (range from 18.2 to 33.6%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and function (15.8%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the increases in CG. Short-term DT led to larger effects on maximal strength (18.1\u201323.8%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of both upper and lower extremity muscles than in muscle power (2\u20134.5%) and function (2.8%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, all measurements remained higher (12.6\u201336.4%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than in pre-training levels.These data indicated that DT may induce larger declines in muscle strength than in power output and preserved physical independence, mediated in part, by the effectiveness of high-speed power training particularly developed for older women.",

     "abstract": "It is well known that oxidative stress is one of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, indicating that may play a key role in this disease. In our study, we measured the levels of oxidative stress indicators (TBARS and protein carbonyls content) and the non-enzymatic (glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG)) and enzymatic (glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) defense systems in the plasma of 46 patients diagnosed of ATD and 46 age-matched controls. We found decreased levels in total GSH in ATD patients, although healthy control women showed lower levels of total GSH than healthy control men. On the contrary, we found increased levels of TBARS and carbonyl groups content in ATD patients in both genders. The activity of the plasma antioxidant enzymes showed no changes for SOD activity in ATD patients, independently of the gender, although western blot analysis showed an increase in SOD-1 protein. CAT activity was also decreased in ATD patients, although this decrease is mainly due to the decrease found in men but not in women. However, western blot analysis did not show differences in CAT protein between controls and ATD patients. Finally, a decrease of GPx activity was found in ATD patients in both genders. However, as with CAT protein, western blot analysis did not show differences in GPx protein between controls and ATD patients. Our results suggest that there is a defect in the antioxidant defense system that is incapable of responding to increased free radical production, which may lead to oxidative damage and the development of the pathological alterations that characterize the neurodegenerative disorder of patients with ATD. Thus, oxidative damage could be one important aspect for the onset of ATD and oxidative stress markers could be useful to diagnose the illness in their earliest stages through both non-invasive, reliable and cost-affordable methods.",

     "abstract": "In contrast to many other complex traits, the natural genetic architecture of life expectancy has not been intensely studied, particularly in non-model organisms, such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.). Multiple factors that determine honey bee worker lifespan have been identified and genetic analyses have been performed on some of those traits. Several of the traits are included in a suite of correlated traits that form the pollen hoarding syndrome, which was named after the behavior to store surplus pollen in the nest and is tied to social evolution. Here, seven quantitative trait loci that had previously been identified for their effects on different aspects of the pollen hoarding syndrome were studied for their genetic influence on the survival of adult honey bee workers. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of worker longevity, a panel of 280 additional SNP markers distributed across the genome was also tested. Allelic distributions were compared between young and old bees in two backcross populations of the bi-directionally selected high- and low-pollen hoarding strain. Our results suggest a pleiotropic effect of at least one of the behavioral quantitative trait loci on worker longevity and one significant and several other putative genetic effects in other genomic regions. At least one locus showed evidence for strong antagonistic pleiotropy and several others suggested genetic factors that influence pre-emergence survival of worker honey bees. Thus, the predicted association between worker lifespan and the pollen hoarding syndrome was supported at the genetic level and the magnitude of the identified effects also strengthened the view that naturally segregating genetic variation can have major effects on age-specific survival probability in the wild.",

The concept of frailty has not been well studied in Japan, which has the largest percentage of older patients (per capita) in the world. We created a 5-year prospective cohort study of community-dwelling older Japanese adults. Participants were not frail at baseline, based on our definition adapted from the Canadian Study for Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale. Participants underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) at baseline, and final assessments were either in person or via mailed survey. We enrolled 407 individuals (184 men, mean age 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years; 223 women, mean age 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years). Sixty-five participants met criteria for frailty by the end of the study. In univariate analyses, eighteen separate parameters were associated with frailty, some of which included: age, gender, handgrip, timed walk, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, cognitive status, living alone, and hearing deficits. In multivariate analyses, the following elements remained associated with frailty: timed walk, pulse pressure, cognition deficits and hearing deficits. We established cut-off points for timed walk (5\u00a0m/3\u00a0s) and pulse pressure (60\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg). We then created a simple additive score for these four factors (present = 1; absent = 0). A score of 0 had a 93% negative predictive value for frailty while a score of 4 had a 70% positive predictive value. While further study is needed, this work creates an easy-to-administer tool that may be generalizable to other populations.",

In WKY, body mass index significantly increased with age. Fat mass may operate as a confounding factor; therefore, WKY (WKY-FR) was pair-fed with SHR. Pair-feeding resulted in a 14% body weight reduction at the age of 52\u00a0weeks in WKY-FR. Renal oxidative stress was increased in aged WKY and SHR. Aged WKY and SHR had increased MR functionality, which correlated positively with increased plasma aldosterone levels, nuclear MR content and abundance of aldosterone effectors in the renal medulla. In contrast, decreases in nuclear MR content were observed in the renal cortex of both strains with aging. When compared to aged SHR, aged WKY-FR had decreased plasma aldosterone levels and decreased activation of the aldosterone/MR system in the renal medulla. Increases in renal oxidative stress and plasma aldosterone in aged WKY, to levels observed in SHR, were not sufficient to result in sustained increases in blood pressure. In conclusion, activation of the aldosterone/MR system is intensified by aging in SHR, whereas increases in body fat mass in WKY associate with hyperaldosteronism and oxidative stress.",

A significant age-related increase has been demonstrated for HCMV-specific serum antibody levels but so far, no information exists whether and to which extent the magnitude of the HCMV-specific memory B cell response develops with increasing age.We examined the size of the HCMV-specific memory B cell response and assessed whether there are quantitative differences in HCMV-specific memory B cell numbers and serum antibody titers against HCMV in young and older persons. The quantities of HCMV-specific memory B cells were determined in 20 young (20\u201331\u00a0years) and 21 older (60\u201380\u00a0years) healthy volunteers by limiting dilution analysis. HCMV-specific antibody levels were analyzed by ELISA.Our study demonstrates that higher HCMV-specific plasma antibody levels correlated well with the numbers of circulating HCMV-specific memory B cells and were not due to a generally higher antibody production in these individuals. The magnitude of HCMV-specific memory B cell responses was significantly higher in the group of older as compared to young subjects, but showed a high degree of individual variation in elderly persons.Together, the results of the present study indicate that the circulating memory B cell pool against HCMV increases during aging in humans. The expansion of HCMV-specific memory B cells and antibody titers possibly contribute to the sustained control of HCMV infection during old age.",

In the present study, we evaluate with immunohistochemistry and the western blot technique the effect that aging has on the calbindin- and calretinin-expressing system of neurons in the higher structures of the central auditory pathway, in the inferior colliculus (IC), medial geniculate body (MGB) and auditory cortex (AC) of two rat strains, the slowly aging Long-Evans and the fast aging Fischer 344. Interestingly, the age-related changes demonstrated a similar character regardless of the rat strain. In the IC of young animals, the majority of calbindin and calretinin immuno-reactive (CB and CR-ir) cells were found in the dorsal and external cortices and only sparse positive cells were present in the central nucleus of the IC. With aging, the number of CB-ir and CR-ir neurons decreased significantly in both the dorsal and external cortices. Furthermore, these declines were accompanied by an age-related reduction in the mean volumes of CB- and CR-ir neuronal somas. In the MGB of young rats, CB-ir neurons were present in abundant numbers in both the dorsal and ventral subdivisions, while CR-ir neurons were practically absent in this structure. With aging, the number and mean volume of CB-ir cells in the ventral subdivision of the MGB were significantly decreased. In comparison with the IC and MGB, age-related numerical and volumetric declines of both CB-ir and CR-ir neurons in the AC were less pronounced. Western blot protein analysis revealed a pronounced age-related decline in the levels of calbindin in both strains and in all examined brain regions. In contrast, the decline in calretinin levels with aging was less prominent, with a significant decline only in the IC of both strains. The observed age-related changes in the calbindin- and calretinin-expressing systems may contribute significantly to the deterioration of hearing function known as central presbycusis.",

We examined disease severity in young, mature, and aged BALB/cBy mice following intratracheal infection with the Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn). Both mature and aged mice failed to clear bacteria and as a result had increased mortality, tissue damage and vascular leakage. Early production of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 during pneumonia declined with age and was associated with an inability of isolated AMs to respond to pneumococcal cell wall (CW) and ethanol-killed Spn ex vivo. Total levels of TLR1 were unaffected by age and TLR2 surface expression was slightly yet significantly increased on aged AMs suggesting that intracellular TLR signaling defects were responsible for the age-related decline in cytokine responsiveness. Following infection of isolated AMs with live Spn, a significant age-related decline in TLR2-induced phosphorylation of p65 NF\u03baB, JNK and p38 MAPK, and an increase in ERK phosphorylation was observed by immunoblotting. These data are the first to demonstrate that TLR2-dependent recognition of Spn by aged AMs is impaired and is associated with a delayed pro-inflammatory cytokine response in vivo along with enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia.",

Nine young (21.3\u00a0years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0years, 4 men) and 9 older (73.1\u00a0years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0years, 5 men) were instructed to accurately match the center of a target with concurrent abduction of the index and little fingers (synergistic two-finger task). The target comprised of 20% MVC and 200\u00a0ms. Visual feedback of the force trajectory and target was provided 1\u00a0s after each trial. Subjects completed 40 trials and the last 10 were used for analysis. Endpoint accuracy was quantified as the normalized deviation from the target in terms of peak force (peak force error), time-to-peak force (time-to-peak force error), and a combination of the two (overall error). Motor output variability was quantified as the standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV) of peak force and time to peak force. The neural activation of the involved synergist muscles (first dorsal interosseus (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM)) was quantified with the electromyography (EMG) amplitude (root mean square) and its frequency structure (wavelet analysis). Older adults exhibited significantly greater peak force (46.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010% vs. 24.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2%) and overall endpoint error (68.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7% vs. 41.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3%), whereas the time to peak force error was similar for the two age groups. Older adults also exerted greater peak force variability than young adults, as quantified by the CV of peak force (34.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5% vs. 24.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3%). The greater peak force error in older adults was associated with changes in the activation of the ADM muscle but not the FDI. Specifically, greater peak force error was associated with greater power from 13\u201330\u00a0Hz and lesser power from 30\u201360\u00a0Hz. These results, therefore, suggest that older adults compared with young adults exhibit impaired endpoint force accuracy during a two finger task because of altered activation of one of the synergist muscles.",

This study aimed to analyze the relationship between CAR and hPER1 gene expression with respect to human aging.Salivary cortisol levels were determined in 20 older women (mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, 67.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.12\u00a0yrs) and 30 young women (24.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.13\u00a0yrs) at awakening (T0) and at 15\u00a0min, 30\u00a0min, 45\u00a0min, and 60\u00a0min after awakening (T15, T30, T45, T60) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. CAR was calculated as difference of the cortisol levels at T0 and T30. The expression of the hPER1 gene at 0800\u00a0h was determined from oral mucosa cells by relative quantification using h36B4 as house-keeping gene. Additional variables, which may affect the CAR, were assessed by questionnaire. Relationships between CAR and other variables were analyzed by correlation and regression analyses.Older women showed significantly lower mean cortisol levels than young women at all five time points (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 to P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The cortisol levels at T30, T45, and T60 correlated positively and significantly with hPER1 gene expression in older women (each, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but not in young women. In both older and young women, the CAR correlated positively with the hPER1 gene expression. This relationship was very strong in older women (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.90, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and non-significant in young women (r\u00a0=\u00a00.33, P\u00a0=\u00a00.390). Regression analysis showed that hPER1 gene expression was the only significant predictor of CAR (r\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.798, SEM\u00a0=\u00a00.07, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in older women.The present study documents the influence of cortisol secretion on hPER1 gene expression in older women. The morning cortisol increase as indicated by CAR correlated positively and significantly with hPER1 gene expression in older women suggesting that hPER1 expression increases in response to the morning cortisol increase in older women. The higher hPER1 response to cortisol increase in older women could be due to the finding that the hPER1 response to cortisol increase seems to be sensitive only at low cortisol levels, but not at higher cortisol levels. This would explain why the older women with low cortisol levels showed an increase of hPER1 expression with increasing cortisol level, whereas young women with higher cortisol levels did not.",

Here we employed a nutritional geometry approach to investigate the interplay among dietary fat, sugar, protein and antioxidant- and polyphenolic-rich freeze-dried a\u00e7ai pulp in modulating lifespan and reproductive output in the Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens (Loew). Individual flies were cultured on one of the 24 diets made from a combination of 1) sugar and yeast extract (SY) at four ratios, 2) palmitic acid, a saturated fat, at two concentrations and 3) freeze-dried a\u00e7ai pulp at three concentrations. Fat addition decreased lifespan in females on the sugar only diet and the diet with a low SY ratio, while decreasing lifetime reproductive output in flies on the diet with the low SY ratio when compared to SY ratio-matched low fat controls. A\u00e7ai supplementation promoted survival, while decreasing lifetime reproductive output, in flies on diets with high fat and high sugar but not other diets when compared to diet-matched non-supplemented controls. These findings reveal that the impact of fat and a\u00e7ai on lifespan and reproductive output depends on the dietary content of other macronutrients. Our results reveal the intricate interplay among macronutrients and nutraceuticals, and underscore the importance of taking macronutrient balance into consideration in designing dietary interventions for aging and health.",

The CAGE, SMAST-G, and AUDIT are the most common and validated questionnaires used to identify AUDs in the elderly, and some laboratory markers of alcohol abuse (AST, GGT, MCV, and CDT) may also be helpful. In particular, the sensitivity of MCV or GGT in detecting alcohol misuse is higher in older than in younger populations. The incidence of medical and neurological complications during alcohol withdrawal syndrome in elderly alcoholics is higher than in younger alcoholics. Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with tissue damage to several organs. Namely, an increased level of blood pressure is more frequent in the elderly than in younger adults, and a greater vulnerability to the onset of alcoholic liver disease, and an increasing risk of breast cancer in menopausal women have been described. In addition, the prevalence of dementia in elderly alcoholics is almost 5 times higher than in non-alcoholic elderly individuals, approximately 25% of elderly patients with dementia also present AUDs, and almost 20% of individuals aged 65 and over with a diagnosis of depression have a co-occurring AUD. Moreover, prevention of drinking relapse in older alcoholics is, in some cases, better than in younger patients; indeed, more than 20% of treated elderly alcohol-dependent patients remain abstinent after 4\u00a0years. Considering that the incidence of AUDs in the elderly is fairly high, and AUDs in the elderly are still underestimated, more studies in the fields of epidemiology, prevention and pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment of AUDs in the elderly are warranted.",

Physical activity attenuated the aging-associated decline in VO2 max (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Aging increased and a single exercise bout decreased the expression of nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1), while the transcription factor A (TFAM) expression showed a strong relationship with VO2max and increased significantly in the young physically active group. Mitochondrial fission representing FIS1 was induced by regular physical activity, while a bout of exercise decreased fusion-associated gene expression. The expression of polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) changed inversely in young and old groups and decreased with aging. The A2 subunit of cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was induced by a single bout of exercise in skeletal muscle samples of both young and old subjects (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Our data suggest that moderate levels of regular physical activity increases a larger number of mitochondrial biogenesis-related gene expressions in young individuals than in aged subjects.

     "abstract": "The widespread use of mobile phones raises the question of the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF, 900\u00a0MHz) on the brain. Previous studies reported increased levels of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the rat's brain after a single exposure to 900\u00a0MHz global system for mobile (GSM) signal, suggesting a potential inflammatory process. While this result was obtained in adult rats, no data is currently available in older animals. Since the transition from middle-age to senescence is highly dependent on environment and lifestyle, we studied the reactivity of middle-aged brains to EMF exposure. We assessed the effects of a single 15\u00a0min GSM exposure (900\u00a0MHz; specific absorption rate (SAR)\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0W/kg) on GFAP expression in young adults (6\u00a0week-old) and middle-aged rats (12\u00a0month-old). Brain interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6, plasmatic levels of corticosterone (CORT), and emotional memory were also assessed.Our data indicated that, in contrast to previously published work, acute GSM exposure did not induce astrocyte activation. Our results showed an IL-1\u03b2 increase in the olfactory bulb and enhanced contextual emotional memory in GSM-exposed middle-aged rats, and increased plasmatic levels of CORT in GSM-exposed young adults.Altogether, our data showed an age dependency of reactivity to GSM exposure in neuro-immunity, stress and behavioral parameters. Reproducing these effects and studying their mechanisms may allow a better understanding of mobile phone EMF effects on neurobiological parameters.",

Physical exercise has been therapeutically employed to ameliorate aging-associated deleterious neurological changes. The aging process, as well as the effects of treadmill exercise on brain excitability, can be influenced by nutritional demands during lactation. In this study we investigated whether physical exercise, lactation conditions, and aging interact and modulate brain electrophysiology as indexed by the excitability-related phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression (CSD). Wistar male rats were suckled in litters of 12 or 6 pups (constituting two groups named L12 and L6), with different lactation conditions. Each group was subdivided into exercised (treadmill) and sedentary. CSD was recorded immediately after the exercise period for young, adult, and aged groups (respectively 45\u201360, 120\u2013130, and 600\u2013700\u00a0days old). In L6 groups, the mean CSD velocity (in mm/min) ranged from 2.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24 in aged rats to 3.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 in young rats, indicating an aging-related CSD deceleration. The L12 condition accelerated CSD (velocities ranging from 3.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21 to 4.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 in aged and young rats, respectively) while treadmill exercise decelerated it in both L6 groups (range: 3.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 to 2.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24) and L12 groups (3.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 to 3.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21), with an observed interaction between factors in the aged group. Furthermore, aging led to a significant failure of CSD propagation. These results contribute to the understanding of underlying mechanisms by which exercise and aging influence brain electrophysiological functioning, previously associated with distinct lactation conditions during the period of brain development.",

The objective of this study is to determine whether or not an intra-articular injection of a single dose of autologous chondrogenic induced BMSC could retard the progressive destruction of cartilage in a surgically induced osteoarthritis in sheep. Sheep BMSCs were isolated and divided into two groups. One group was cultured in chondrogenic media containing (Ham's F12:DMEM, 1:1) FD\u00a0+\u00a01% FBS\u00a0+\u00a05\u00a0ng/ml TGF\u03b23\u00a0+\u00a050\u00a0ng/ml IGF-1 (CM), and the other group was cultured in the basal media, FD\u00a0+\u00a010% FBS (BM). The procedure for surgically induced osteoarthritis was performed on the donor sheep 6\u00a0weeks prior to intra-articular injection into the knee joint of a single dose of BMSC from either group, suspended in 5\u00a0ml FD at density of 2\u00a0million\u00a0cells/ml. The control groups were injected with basal media, without cells. Six weeks after injection, gross evidence of retardation of cartilage destruction was seen in the osteoarthritic knee joints treated with CM as well as BM. No significant ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) scoring was detected between the two groups with cells. However macroscopically, meniscus repair was observed in the knee joint treated with CM. Severe osteoarthritis and meniscal injury was observed in the control group. Interestingly, histologically the CM group demonstrated good cartilage histoarchitecture, thickness and quality, comparable to normal knee joint cartilage. As a conclusion, intra-articular injection of a single dose of BMSC either chondrogenically induced or not, could retard the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in a sheep model, but the induced cells indicated better results especially in meniscus regeneration.",

We studied the profiles of neutral and polar lipids of head, thorax and abdomen of standard populations kept at 23\u00a0\u00b0C, at different ages. Lipid classes were separated by thin layer chromatography, and the quantitative values were used to find patterns of change using a multivariate principal component analysis approach. The lipid-dependent principal components obtained correlated with age, and differences between sexes were consistent with differences in the shape of the survival curves and the mortality parameters. These same components were able to discriminate populations with a behavioral decline due to a mild 28\u00a0\u00b0C thermal stress. Thus, young populations at 28\u00a0\u00b0C showed similar lipid profiles than old populations at 23\u00a0\u00b0C.

Thirty-one healthy elderly men (65.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0) participated in this study. Echo intensity of rectus femoris and quadriceps femoris muscle thicknesses was determined by ultrasound images. Lower-body isometric and isokinetic peak torques (60, 180 and 360\u00b0.s\u22121), as well as rate of force development were evaluated as strength parameters. In addition, torque per unit of muscle mass was evaluated by the quotient between isometric peak torque of the knee extensors and the quadriceps femoris muscle thickness. The peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), maximum aerobic workload (Wm\u00e1x), absolute (VT1 and VT2) ventilatory thresholds, as well as workloads at VT1 and VT2 (WVT1 and WVT2) were evaluated during a maximal incremental test on a cycle ergometer. There were significant negative correlations between the individual values of echo intensity with the corresponding individual values of isometric and isokinetic peak torques (60, 180 and 360\u00b0.s\u22121) (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.48 to r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.64; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), as well as with WVT1 (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.46) and WVT2 (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.50) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

This study examined the relationships between diet quality (DQ) and cognition for over 3\u00a0years among 1488 older adults (52.6% female) from the NuAge study, aged 67 to 84\u00a0years at recruitment.Cognition was assessed at four annual visits using the modified mini-mental status examination (3MS); rate of cognitive decline was computed for each participant over the 3\u00a0years of follow-up using mixed model analyses and the individual-specific number of months between 3MS assessments. Dietary data were collected at recruitment using a validated 78-item, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). DQ was characterized as the Canadian Healthy Eating Index (C-HEI), a 9-component global DQ index (maximum score\u00a0=\u00a0100) computed from the FFQ output. Other variables were collected by questionnaire or direct measurement. Multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the association of DQ controlled for confounders on cognition.Total C-HEI was better in females (78.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.1 vs 75.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.4, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) as were C-HEI component subscores. Males, the less educated, smokers, those with poor social engagement, symptoms of depression, a higher waist:hip ratio and who reported financial insecurity had a poor quality diet that could contribute to chronic diseases associated with cognition. Along with functional autonomy, most of these variables emerged as covariates of baseline 3MS and predictors of cognitive decline. While certain C-HEI subscores and total C-HEI were positive univariate correlates of 3MS at recruitment, total DQ was not associated with cognition in multivariate analyses, either at baseline or over 3\u00a0years of follow-up.DQ was not independently associated with cognition. However, the study demonstrates relationships between diet quality and risk factors for chronic diseases associated with cognition. Consequently, older adults might benefit from a healthy diet to decrease risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases established as risk factors for cognitive decline.

     "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) without malnutrition is the only intervention to consistently increase lifespan in all species tested, and lower age-related pathologies in mammals including humans. It has been suggested that uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, using chemical uncouplers, mimics CR, and that overlapping mechanisms underlie the phenotypic changes induced by uncoupling and CR. We aimed to critically assess this using a unique mouse model of skeletal muscle-targeted UCP3-induced uncoupling (UCP3Tg), and focused our studies mainly on skeletal muscle mitochondria. Compared to ad libitum fed Wt mice, skeletal muscle mitochondria from ad libitum fed UCP3Tg mice showed higher basal uncoupling and lower H2O2 emission, with unchanged maximal oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial content. UCP3Tg CR mice showed some tendency for differential adaptation to CR, with lowered H+ leak conductance and evidence for higher H2O2 emission from skeletal muscle mitochondria following 2\u00a0weeks CR, and failure to lower H2O2 emission after 1\u00a0month CR. Differential adaptation was also apparent at the whole body level: while UCP3Tg CR mice lost as much weight as Wt CR mice, the proportion of muscle lost was higher in UCP3Tg mice. However, a striking outcome of our studies was the absence of change with CR in many of the parameters of mitochondrial function and content that we measured in mice of either genotype. Overall, our study raises the question of whether CR can consistently modify skeletal muscle mitochondria; alterations with CR may only be apparent under certain conditions such as during the 2\u00a0wk CR intervention in the UCP3Tg mice.",

The total cf-DNA concentration also remained as an independent predictor of 4-year all-cause mortality. A predominance of low-molecular-weight cf-DNA was observed in ANA-seropositive subjects but this cf-DNA pattern was not associated with mortality.

However, information on DL in other nematode species is limited. In this study, the survivorship, storage, energy consumption, and oxidative stress tolerance of Caenorhabditis japonica DL were examined. C. japonica is a close relative of C. elegans, but has species-specific phoretic associations with the shield bug Parastrachia japonensis. Also, its DL has a much longer lifespan than C. elegans in a biological setting. However, when C. japonica DLs were detached from their phoretic host, they did not survive more than 10\u00a0days while more than 80% of C. elegans survived under the same conditions. Also, C. japonica DL showed more active movement (swimming) and lower tolerance to oxidative stress than C. elegans DL. Because the concentration of triacylglycerol (TAG), the energy source of nematodes, did not decrease significantly during the experiment, exhaustion of the energy reservoir did not cause the low survivorship of C. japonica. Instead, low tolerance to oxidizing stress and increased production of reactive oxygen species in C. japonica were the main causes of the reduced survivorship. The fact that C. japonica DL cannot survive away from its insect host indicates that its longevity is increased by unknown factors derived from the host. Despite these significant differences between C. japonica and C. elegans, these two species are phylogenetically closely related (they are derived from a common ancestor). Therefore, C. japonica could be a good comparative system for C. elegans, and further physiological and molecular analyses of C. japonica DL may provide important information about the internal and external factors affecting the longevity of nematodes in general.",

We also checked for associations of cell expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase type-1 (GPx-1) antioxidative enzymes, with number of CD34+ progenitor cells and mortality. We found that in very old subjects the number of CD34+ cells at baseline were higher in subjects who reached older age at death or were still living at the end of observation period, with respect to subjects who died from all causes, including CV deaths. On the other hand, HDL-C plasma levels and, with the exception of diabetes, the classic CV risk factors (hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia) showed a loss of their predictive power. A significant association between the redox system of CD34+ cells and mortality was also observed. These data suggest that, even in the elderly, CD34+ cells maintain their role in predicting mortality. CD34+ cells could thus be considered as a biomarker of longevity.",

The underlying conditions may be either primarily pulmonary diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or non respiratory conditions secondarily affecting the lung, e. g. congestive heart failure, or else conditions affecting the lung expansion, e. g. obesity or rib cage deformity. The diagnosis is frequently based on the measurement of surrogate indexes such as the forced vital capacity (FVC) used as a proxy for total lung capacity (TLC). As a consequence, diagnosis of RLD is often characterized by poor specificity. In the elderly, worsening in the quality of life and poor prognosis are variably, but significantly, associated to RLD, being the underlying condition an important source of variability. Several causes of RLD are preventable and treatable conditions. A prompt identification of these conditions may allow to slow the decline of respiratory reserve and, thus, to preserve both personal independence and resistance to acute respiratory infections.This review gives an update on the latest evidence available on the prevalence and the prognosis of RLD in the elderly.

Unimpaired younger and older men and women (7/group, total n\u00a0=\u00a028) performed three maximal-effort trials for both directions of footplate motion (IN and OUT) at three speed profiles (knee rotation speeds of 15, 25, and 35\u00b0/s) on a motor-driven and computer-controlled leg press. Normalized forces were tested for effects of age group, sex, direction of footplate motion, and knee rotation speed. Peak forces were 57% greater for younger and 20% greater for IN. Trends of greater IN relative to OUT forces (IN overloading) were present in women, but this was due to an inverse correlation between strength and IN overloading that was independent of age group and sex. Leg press strength training on a device that is capable of overloading lengthening muscle fibers is a promising new training method that appears to have the greatest potential benefits for the weakest participants. Training target profiles on the device tested and others similar to it should be set based on participant-specific maximums across the ROM in both IN and OUT directions at a speed in the middle of the range to be trained.",

     "abstract": "The decline in muscular strength with age is disproportionate to the loss in total muscle mass that causes it. Knocking out JP45, an integral protein of the junctional face membrane of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), results in decreased expression of the voltage-gated Ca2\u00a0+ channel, Cav1.1; excitation\u2013contraction uncoupling (ECU); and loss of muscle force (Delbono et al., 2007). Here, we show that Cav1.1 expression, charge movement, SR Ca2\u00a0+ release, in vitro contractile force, and sustained forced running remain stable in male JP45KO mice at 12 and 18\u00a0months. They also exhibit the level of ECU reported for 3\u20134-month mice (Delbono et al., 2007). No further decline at later ages was recorded. Preserved ECC was not related to increased expression of any protein that directly or indirectly interacts with JP45 at the triad junction. However, maintained muscle force and physical performance were associated with ablation of JP45 expression in the brain, spontaneous and significantly diminished food intake and less tendency toward obesity when exposed to a high-fat diet compared to WT. We propose that (1) endogenously generated restriction in food intake overcomes the deleterious effects of JP45 ablation on ECC and skeletal muscle force mainly through downregulation of neuropeptide-Y expression in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus; and (2) the JP45KO mouse constitutes an invaluable model to examine the mechanisms controlling food intake as well as skeletal muscle function with aging.",

So far, little is known about the systemic bone microstructural changes that occur at the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae. In this study, we therefore investigated segmental variations of vertebral trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) and three-dimensional microstructure in SAMP6 and the normal control mouse (SAMR1) at 12\u00a0months of age using quantitative micro computed tomography (micro-CT) and image analysis software. The vertebral height and vertebral cross-sectional area (CSA) increased, while vertebral trabecular BMD and trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) decreased from the cervical to lumbar spine both in SAMR1 and SAMP6. As compared with SAMR1, the thoracic vertebral CSA had a tendency to be low and the lumbar vertebral CSA was significantly declined in SAMP6. The vertebral trabecular BMD, BV/TV, trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and trabecular number (Tb.N) significantly decreased in cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine of SAMP6. Trabecular bone pattern factor (TBPf) was higher at the lumbar spine and the structure model index (SMI) of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine was higher in SAMP6. These results indicate that vertebral trabecular bone microstructures are remarkably heterogeneous throughout the spine in both SAMR1 and SAMP6. The decrease of vertebral trabecular bone density in SAMP6 advanced faster caudally than cranially within the spine, similar phenomena were observed in humans. These findings highlight the relevance of SAMP6 for studies of vertebral fragility associated with senile osteoporosis.",

     "abstract": "Studies have shown that ageing alone can cause increases in the concentrations of many cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins. Therefore, CSF protein concentrations must be interpreted with caution before concluding that the increased concentrations of certain proteins can be used as disease-specific biomarkers. Age-related reduction in CSF turnover has been shown to have a significant concentrating effect on CSF proteins from young to old. As a result, CSF protein concentrations need to be corrected with age-specific turnovers first before performing any data comparisons between different ages. This study applied the concept of CSF/plasma concentration ratios of plasma-derived proteins that is frequently used in the investigation of brain barrier integrity to calculate the amount of protein that enters the CSF from the plasma side in different age groups. Based on our calculations, proteins with molecular weights greater than 91.92\u00a0kDa for the young, 109.51\u00a0kDa for the middle-aged and 120\u00a0kDa for the old should not be able to cross the brain barriers of the blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers to enter the CSF from the plasma side. For proteins that can be derived from the choroid plexus (CP), brain, and plasma, the amount that crosses the barriers to enter the CSF from the plasma side will contribute to their measured total protein concentrations in the CSF. CP and brain production of these proteins can be calculated when turnover corrected CSF protein concentrations are further corrected by the amount of protein that crosses the barriers. In this study, CP and brain produced concentrations of transthyretin, retinol binding protein, alpha-1-antitrypsin, gelsolin, and lactotransferrin were calculated. The production of these proteins decreased with age with alpha-1-antitrypsin protein revealing the most substantial decrease of 86% from young (0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mg.dL\u2212\u00a01) to old (0.02\u00a0mg.dL\u2212\u00a01). In conclusion, measured CSF protein concentrations for proteins that can be derived from the CP, brain, and plasma need to be corrected by age-specific CSF turnovers and by the amount of protein that crosses the brain barriers first before their concentrations can be compared logically between different ages.",

Increased synthesis and activity of the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun have been implicated in efficient motor axonal regeneration. In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that the impaired regenerative capacity in the aged is associated with impaired induction of c-Jun. In non-manipulated young adult or aged mice, no c-Jun and its phosphorylated form were detected in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Following nerve crush, significant c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun occurred in the injured motoneurons of young adult mice, but not in aged animals. In accord with the immunohistochemistry, Western blots also showed that sciatic nerve crush induced c-Jun and its phosphorylation expression in the ventral horn of young adult but not in aged mice. Changes in c-Jun mRNA level detected by in situ hybridization are congruent with that in c-Jun protein content, showing an increase at 5\u00a0days after crush in young adult but not aged. Moreover, compared with young adult mice, aged mice showed impaired motor axonal regeneration. These results demonstrate that the impaired motor axonal regeneration seen in aged mice is correlated with impaired c-Jun expression and phosphorylation following injury. These data provide a neurobiological explanation for the poor outcome associated with nerve repair in the aged.",

While reducing input from one eye through monocular deprivation induces a marked ocular dominance (OD) shift of neurons in the primary visual cortex during development, the same manipulation is totally ineffective after the closure of the critical period. We show that EE is able to reactivate OD plasticity in the visual cortex of aging rats, as assessed with both visual-evoked potentials and single-unit recordings. A marked reduction in intracortical GABAergic inhibition and a remodeling of extracellular matrix accompany this effect. The non-invasive nature of EE makes this paradigm eligible for human application.",

Insight into possible reasons for non-participation could help to improve trial designs and participation rates among this age-group. The aim of this study was to explore reasons why older people refuse to participate in falls prevention trials.A qualitative study.Community-dwelling adults aged \u2265\u00a065\u00a0years who attended the Emergency Department due to a fall and refused to participate in a falls prevention trial (IMPROveFALL-study).A structured interview guide was used, and interview transcripts were subjected to an independent content analysis by two researchers.15 interviews were conducted. A main reason to refuse trial participation was mobility impairment. In contrast, younger and more \u201cactive\u201d and mobile seniors considered themselves \u201ctoo healthy\u201d to participate. Persons with multiple comorbidities mentioned that they attended a hospital too often, or experienced adequate follow-up by their own physicians already. Transport problems, including distance to the hospital, parking facilities, and travel expenses were another issue. During the interviews it was emphasized by the patients, that they knew the reason for their fall. However, they were not familiar with the positive effects of falls prevention programmes.Older persons reported multiple reasons to refuse participation in a falls prevention study, such as health-related factors, several practical problems, and personal beliefs about the causes and preventability of falls. Anticipation of those issues might contribute to an improvement in participation rates of older fallers, shorter study duration, and a better generalizability of research findings.",

Here we report a comparison of mitochondrial ROS production in two short-living (quails) and three long-living bird species (parrots) that exhibit, on average, a 5-fold longevity difference. Mitochondrial ROS production was determined both in isolated mitochondria (heart, skeletal muscle and liver) as traditionally done and also in intact erythrocytes. In all four tissues, mitochondrial ROS production was similar in quails and parrots and showed no correspondence with known longevity differences. The lack of a consistent difference between quails and parrots was not due to differences in mitochondrial content as ROS production in relation to oxygen consumption (determined as the free radical leak) showed a similar pattern. These findings cast doubt on the robustness of the oxidative stress theory of aging.",

     "abstract": "The oxidative damage hypothesis of aging posits that the accumulation of oxidative damage is a determinant of an animal species' maximum lifespan potential (MLSP). Recent findings in extremely long-living mammal species such as naked mole-rats challenge this proposition. Among birds, parrots are exceptionally long-living with an average MLSP of 25\u00a0years, and with some species living more than 70\u00a0years. By contrast, quail are among the shortest living bird species, averaging about 5-fold lower MLSP than parrots. To test if parrots have correspondingly (i) superior antioxidant protection and (ii) lower levels of oxidative damage compared to similar-sized quail, we measured (i) total antioxidant capacity, uric acid and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, as well as the activities of enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase), and (ii) markers of mitochondrial DNA damage (8-OHdG), protein damage (protein carbonyls) and lipid peroxidation (lipid hydroperoxides and TBARS) in three species of long-living parrots and compared these results to corresponding measures in two species of short-living quails (average MLSP\u00a0=\u00a05.5\u00a0years). All birds were fed the same diet to exclude differences in dietary antioxidant levels. Tissue antioxidants and oxidative damage were determined both \u2018per mg protein\u2019 and \u2018per g tissue\u2019. Only glutathione peroxidase was consistently higher in tissues of the long-living parrots and suggests higher protection against the harmful effects of hydroperoxides, which might be important for parrot longevity. The levels of oxidative damage were mostly statistically indistinguishable between parrots and quails (67%), occasionally higher (25%), but rarely lower (8%) in the parrots. Despite indications of higher protection against some aspects of oxidative stress in the parrots, the pronounced longevity of parrots appears to be independent of their antioxidant mechanisms and their accumulation of oxidative damage.",

Preclinical and some clinical investigations support the protective role of selenium against prostate cancer possibly through the reduction of oxidative stress. While increased levels of oxidative stress together with decreases in selenium and the major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) are common in tissues of old animals, there is little data available on these parameters in the prostate. In the present study we have compared the levels of selenium, GSH and protein-bound GSH (GSSP) in blood and prostate tissues in young (4-month), mature (12-month), old (18\u00a0month), and very old (24\u00a0month) male F344 rats. Each prostate lobe (dorsolateral, DL; anterior, AL; ventral, VL) was analyzed separately based upon their differing potential for prostate cancer development. At all ages, selenium levels were lowest in DL\u00a0<\u00a0VL\u00a0<\u00a0AL. After 12\u00a0mo, an 85% reduction in selenium in the DL was observed (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while levels in other lobes were unchanged. In animals of all ages, levels of GSH were lowest in the VL\u00a0<\u00a0DL\u00a0=\u00a0AL and no significant changes were observed in GSH levels by 18 mo. However, GSSP, a marker of oxidative stress, was increased 90% after 18\u00a0mo in the DL only (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). These findings of age-related changes in GSSP and selenium in the DL prostate are consistent with the sensitivity of this lobe to carcinogenesis and, thus, may be playing a mechanistic role.",

In the present study we show the impact of long term (~17\u00a0years) calorie restriction (CR) on muscle aging in very old monkeys (27\u201333\u00a0yrs) compared to age-matched Control monkeys fed ad libitum, and describe these data in the context of the whole longitudinal study. Muscle mass was preserved in very old calorie restricted (CR) monkeys compared to age-matched Controls. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an age-associated increase in the proportion of Type I fibers in the VL from Control animals that was prevented with CR. The cross sectional area (CSA) of Type II fibers was reduced in old CR animals compared to earlier time points (16\u201322\u00a0years of age); however, the total loss in CSA was only 15% in CR animals compared to 36% in old Controls at ~27\u00a0years of age. Atrophy was not detected in Type I fibers from either group. Notably, Type I fiber CSA was ~1.6 fold greater in VL from CR animals compared to Control animals at ~27\u00a0years of age. The frequency of VL muscle fibers with defects in mitochondrial electron transport system enzymes (ETSab), the absence of cytochrome c oxidase and hyper-reactive succinate dehydrogenase, were identical between Control and CR. We describe changes in ETSab fiber CSA and determined that CR fibers respond differently to the challenge of mitochondrial deficiency. Fiber counts of intact rectus femoris muscles revealed that muscle fiber density was preserved in old CR animals. We suggest that muscle fibers from CR animals are better poised to endure and adapt to changes in muscle mass than those of Control animals.",

Lung cancer is the number one cause for cancer mortality and surgical resection is the treatment of choice whenever possible. This study investigates whether elderly patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are characterized by distinct clinical and pathologic features and different clinical course after resection. Special emphasis is placed on disease recurrence, which is an important, but rarely described parameter for biological tumor behavior.Sex, stage, histology, differentiation grade, smoking status, performance status, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, Ki-67 index, recurrent disease and overall survival were analyzed in 383 surgically resected NSCLC patients. Calculations were performed comparing patients <\u00a070 to \u2265\u00a070\u00a0years. A postoperative follow-up period of 15\u00a0years enabled detailed correlations.Rate of disease recurrence and disease-free survival did not differ between any age groups and was not influenced by clinico-pathologic parameters. Elderly patients with a Ki-67 index of >\u00a03% were associated with significantly decreased overall survival time when compared to younger patients (36.3 and 47.3\u00a0months respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029).The biological behavior of NSCLC as reflected by characteristics of disease recurrence is similar for surgically resected patients among different age groups and does not warrant specific recommendations for the elderly surgical patient. The Ki-67 index offers prognostic information for overall survival in the elderly.",

Two hundred healthy Tunisian subjects (30\u201385\u00a0years old) were recruited and separated into two subgroups: elderly (65\u201385\u00a0years old) and middle-aged (30\u201360\u00a0years old). The findings revealed that plasma zinc and calcium concentrations significantly decreased according to age. The prevalence of zinc deficiency was therefore shown to increase in old age (over 60% of elderly subjects were deficient or at risk of deficiency). No age-related changes were obtained for copper or magnesium status. The \u03946 desaturase, involved in the EFAs conversion, was shown to decrease according to age and to be associated with the plasma zinc level. Since elderly subjects were at risk of nutritional imbalance, it would be interesting to set optimal dietary proportion. This will help to prevent age-associated alterations and diseases for a better and healthy ageing.",

Cognitive decline also occurs in aged dogs, although the age-related changes that occur in the canine cerebral WM are yet to be studied, particularly with regard to their relevance to the WM alterations of elderly humans. The present study revealed age-dependent myelin loss in the frontal lobe WM of canine brains. The accumulation of ceroid-lipofuscin-laden phagocytes was observed in the perivascular spaces of the WM and was correlated with the decrease in myelination. Also, myelin basic protein was detected in some of the vacuoles of these phagocytes. In the WM, beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) was deposited focally in capillary walls, and colocalized with apolipoprotein E (Apo E). Note that the dog is homozygous for Apo E4, which genotype is related to capillary CAA in humans. These findings indicate that WM demyelination occurs in aged dogs as well as in aged humans, hence WM alterations may account for age-related behavioral changes of the dog.

It is predicted to be the homolog of human outer mitochondrial membrane protein 25 (OMP25 or synaptojanin-2-binding protein), which is a PDZ domain containing protein with a putative role in cellular stress response pathways. Here, we provide evidence that MICS-1 is an interacting partner of mitochondrial protein ATAD-3 (homologue of human ATAD3), which is essential for C. elegans development. We demonstrate that mics-1(RNAi) animals or mics-1 mutants display enhanced longevity with an increased mean lifespan of up to 54% compared to control animals. Of note, also atad-3(RNAi) promoted longevity, although to a lesser extend (29% compared to controls). In addition, thermal stress of mics-1 mutants induced low reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, whereas atad-3(RNAi) animals were highly sensitive to this assay, displaying drastically increased ROS levels. Further studies revealed that MICS-1 and ATAD-3 associated longevity was partially dependent on the presence of DAF-16. However, for both conditions, we also found a DAF-16 independent extension of lifespan. Finally, we observed an additional lifespan extension in mics-1 mutants when subjected to atad-3(RNAi) whereas heat induced ROS production was even aggravated under this condition. This suggests (partially) independent effects of MICS-1 and ATAD-3 on lifespan and ROS production in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Post-translational oxidative protein modifications which are more marked during aging and/or high-calorie (HC) diets affect protein function and metabolism. Protein function and metabolism are different according to the type of muscle proteins. Oxidative muscle protein modifications may thus be associated with age-related sarcopenia, and HC may be implicated in the development of sarcopenia by emphasizing protein modifications. Understanding the role of protein modifications in the process of sarcopenia and metabolism associated with a high fat diet may be elucidated by investigations with skeletal muscle protein subfractionations. To study this hypothesis, carbonylated protein (CP) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels were measured in mixed, sarcoplasmic, myofibrillar and mitochondrial protein fractions of quadriceps in rats aged 6\u00a0months (A) and 25\u00a0months (O) fed a normal calorie (NC) or HC diet for 3\u00a0months (AN, AH, ON, OH n\u00a0=\u00a07\u20138). Muscle weight was lower in the older rats (AN: 0.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0g, ON: 0.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0g, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but no HC effect was observed.

Hence cumulative 3-NT in skeletal muscle protein appears associated with the development of age-related muscle loss.

Eight weeks after the OVX, a tibial bone defect was created in all animals and they were randomly divided into 3 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a010): control bone defect group (CG): bone defects without any treatment; laser 60\u00a0J/cm2 group (L60): animals irradiated with LLLT, at 60\u00a0J/cm2 and laser 120\u00a0J/cm2 group (L120): animals irradiated with LLLT, at 120\u00a0J/cm2.In the laser treated groups, at both fluences, a higher amount of newly formed bone was evidenced as well as granulation tissue compared to control. Picrosirius analysis demonstrated that irradiated animals presented a higher deposition of collagen fibers and a better organization of these fibers when compared to other groups, mainly at 120\u00a0J/cm2. COX-2, Cbfa-1 or VEGF immunoreactivity was detected in a similar manner either 60\u00a0J/cm2 or 120\u00a0J/cm2 fluences. However, no differences were shown in the biomechanical analysis.Taken together, our results support the notion that LLLT improves bone repair in the tibia of osteoporotic rats as a result of stimulation of the newly formed bone, fibrovascularization and angiogenesis.",

In asymptomatic subjects, whether the inverse association between physical fitness and inflammatory biomarkers is dependent or is independent of fat mass, a significant source of inflammatory cytokines, and is independent of age, muscle mass and strength, endocrine, metabolic, and lifestyle factors is not known. Two hundred and twenty asymptomatic women aged 20 to 72\u00a0years with a C-reactive protein <\u00a05\u00a0mg/L were assessed for their mean speed over the 6-minute walking test (6MWS) and their serum IL-6, as well as body height, body weight, body lean and fat mass (measured by DXA), waist-to-hip ratio, grip and knee extension strength, physical activities (quantified by the QUANTAP questionnaire), tobacco consumption, serum 25(OH) vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), estradiol (E2), free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), calcium, albumin, and creatinine. In the stepwise multiple linear regression model, a 6MWS in the highest quartile (over 1.4\u00a0m/s) was associated with lower values of serum IL-6 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and with higher values of grip strength (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and creatinine (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). In conclusion, present results demonstrate that the relationship between lower levels of serum IL-6 and higher values of physical fitness in asymptomatic women is independent of age, body composition, and lifestyle, endocrine and metabolic confounders.

In this study, we analyzed the replicative life span of 73 yeast deletion mutants lacking the genes of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain system, and found that nine of these mutants (\u0394nde1, \u0394tcm62, \u0394rip1, \u0394cyt1, \u0394qrc8, \u0394pet117, \u0394cox11, \u0394atp11, \u0394fmc1) had significantly shorter life spans. These mutants had lower rates of respiration and were slightly sensitive to exogenous administration of hydrogen peroxide. However, only two of them, \u0394nde1 and \u0394fmc1, produced higher amounts of intrinsic superoxide radicals in the presence of glucose compared to that of wild type cells. Interestingly, there were no significant alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potentials of these mutants. We speculate that the shorter life spans of ETC mutants result from multiple mechanisms including the low respiration rate and low energy production rather than just a ROS-dependent path.",

In this study, atomic force microscopy was used for imaging and measuring the size of mineral grains, as well as nano-scale mechanical characterization (nanoindentation) of the bone mineralized matrix of trabeculae, with the aim to explore the age effects on bone elasticity and give new insight into age-related bone fragility.The bone samples in this study comprised trabecular bone specimens of the femoral neck region, collected from eight skeletal healthy women (five young adults: 27\u201338\u00a0yrs., three elderly: 83\u201394\u00a0yrs.) at autopsy.Bone trabeculae in the elderly displayed a higher modulus and nanohardness, signifying a decreased amount of energy that can be accommodated by the bone tissue during loading. Regression analysis revealed that nearly 65% of variability in the bone matrix elastic modulus can be statistically explained by the changes in size of the matrix mineral grains. This study revealed that the bone trabeculae of elderly women express less elastic behavior at the material level, which makes them more vulnerable to unusual impact loads originating from a fall.The observed age-related structural and mechanical alteration at the bone material level adds new evidence for understanding why hip fractures are more frequent in elderly women.",

Subjects trained strength and endurance training 3 times per week performing both exercise types in the same training session.

In addition, muscle quality (MQ) was evaluated by the quotient between maximal dynamic strength (one repetition maximum test) of the knee extensors and the quadriceps femoris muscle thickness determined by ultrasonography. There were no modifications after training in the VT1, VT2, VT1%, and VT2%. There was significant increase in the WVT1 only in SE (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), as well as significant increase in the WVT2 in both groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

The present study investigated the lifespan-prolonging activity of blueberry extracts in fruit flies and explored its underlying mechanism. Results revealed that blueberry extracts at 5\u00a0mg/ml in diet could significantly extend the mean lifespan of fruit flies by 10%, accompanied by up-regulating gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and Rpn11 and down-regulating Methuselah (MTH) gene. Intensive H2O2 and Paraquat challenge tests showed that lifespan was only extended in Oregon-R wild type flies but not in SODn108 or Catn1 mutant strains. Chronic Paraquat exposure shortened the maximum survival time from 73 to 35\u00a0days and decreased the climbing ability by 60% while blueberry extracts at 5\u00a0mg/ml in diet could significantly increase the survival rate and partially restore the climbing ability with up-regulating SOD, CAT, and Rpn11. Furthermore, gustatory assay demonstrated that those changes were not due to the variation of food intake between the control and the experimental diet containing 5\u00a0mg/ml blueberry extracts. It was therefore concluded that the lifespan-prolonging activity of blueberry extracts was at least partially associated with its interactions with MTH, Rpn11, and endogenous antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT.",

The associations between SNPs in ADARB1 and ADARB2 and clinical parameters related to risk factors of atherosclerosis were analyzed.On uni- and multivariate analyses, rs2805533 in ADARB2 was significantly associated with the abdominal circumference, body mass index, serum triglyceride level, and serum adiponectin level. The subjects with the AA genotype of rs2805533 had a greater abdominal circumference, higher body mass index, higher triglyceride level, and lower adiponectin level than those with AG and GG genotypes.The SNP in ADARB2 related to longevity is associated with metabolic disorders.

The AD model, manifesting A\u03b2 proteotoxicity, in C. elegans is well established and has provided valuable insights. Earlier, we have reported that Reserpine, an FDA-approved antihypertensive drug, increases C. elegans lifespan with a high quality of life and ameliorates A\u03b2 toxicity in C. elegans. But reserpine does not seem to act through the known lifespan extension pathways or inhibition of its known target, vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT. Reserpine's mode of action and the pathways it activates are not known. Here, we have evaluated the presynaptic neurotransmitter(s) release pathway and identified acetylcholine (ACh) as the crucial player for reserpine's action. The corroborating evidences are: i) lack of lifespan extension in the ACh loss of function (hypomorphic) \u2013 synthesis (cha-1) and transport (unc-17) mutants; ii) mitigation of chronic aldicarb effect; iii) lifespan extension in dopamine (cat-2) and dopamine and serotonin (bas-1) biosynthetic mutants; iv) no rescue from exogenous serotonin induced paralysis in the AD model worms; upon reserpine treatment. Thus, modulation of acetylcholine is essential for reserpine's action.",

Not only does the incidence of MI increase with age, but the heart becomes more susceptible to MI induced damage and protective interventions such as ischemic preconditioning (IPC) become less effective. Therefore, any rational therapeutic strategy must be built around the ability to combat the detrimental effects of ischemia in aged individuals. To accomplish this, we need to develop a better understanding of how ischemic damage, protection, and aging are linked. In this regard, mitochondria have emerged as a common theme. First, mitochondria contribute to cell damage during ischemia\u2013reperfusion (IR) and are central to cell death. Second, the protective signaling pathways activated by IPC converge on mitochondria, and the opening of mitochondrial ion channels alone is sufficient to elicit protection. Finally, mitochondria clearly influence the aging process, and specific defects in mitochondrial activity are associated with age-related functional decline. This review will summarize the effects of aging on myocardial IR injury and discuss relevant and emerging strategies to protect against MI with an emphasis on mitochondrial function.",

Furthermore, it is unclear whether exercise training initiated late in life affects myocyte anabolic signaling in a dose-dependent manner. Hence, we sought to investigate the effects of treadmill exercise and training frequency on anabolic pathways, including insulin signaling, in the skeletal muscle of old rats. Aged (14\u201316-month-old) male Wistar rats were trained on a treadmill for 3 (EX3) or 5\u00a0days/week (EX5) during 8\u00a0weeks and compared with age-matched sedentary controls (SED). Four-month-old rats were used as young controls (YC). Protein expression levels of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), activated (phosphorylated) mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) and glucose transporter GLUT4 were determined in quadriceps muscle extracts via immunoblotting. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity was assessed by histochemical staining, while electron microscopy was employed to quantify the sarcomere volume (Vsrc). Body weight (BW) increased, whereas muscle weight (MW) and Vsrc decreased with age. EX5, but not EX3 increased MW and Vsrc, without affecting BW. The expression of IR and GLUT4 was higher in SED rats relative to the YC group. Conversely, protein levels of IRS-1 and p-mTOR as well as COX activity were reduced in advanced age. Compared with SED rats, EX3 animals displayed reduced IR expression and increased IRS-1 levels and COX activity. The expression of GLUT 4 and p-mTOR was unaffected by EX3. EX5 up-regulated IRS-1 and p-mTOR expression and COX activity, while decreasing GLUT4 levels, with no effect on IR expression. In summary, substantial impairments in muscle anabolic pathways, including insulin signaling, were detected in aged sedentary rats. These changes were ameliorated by exercise training, concomitant with improvements in muscle trophism. Benefits were more evident in rats trained for 5\u00a0days/week, suggesting that physical exercise initiated late in life affects anabolic signaling in a dose-dependent manner.",

     "abstract": "While the mechanisms of cellular aging remain controversial, a leading hypothesis is that mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction play a critical role in this process. Here, we provide data in aging rhesus macaques supporting the hypothesis that increased oxidative stress is a major characteristic of aging and may be responsible for the age-associated increase in mitochondrial dysfunction. We measured mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage by quantitative PCR in liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of young, middle age, and old monkeys and show that older monkeys have increases in the number of mtDNA lesions. There was a direct correlation between the amount of mtDNA lesions and age, supporting the role of mtDNA damage in the process of aging. Liver from older monkeys showed significant increases in lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylations and reduced antioxidant enzyme activity. Similarly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the middle age group showed increased levels in carbonylated proteins, indicative of high levels of oxidative stress. Together, these results suggest that the aging process is associated with defective mitochondria, where increased production of reactive oxygen species results in extensive damage at the mtDNA and protein levels. This study provides valuable data based on the rhesus macaque model further validating age-related mitochondrial functional decline with increasing age and suggesting that mtDNA damage might be a good biomarker of aging.",

     "abstract": "The lower extremities are important to performing physical activities of daily life. This study investigated lower extremity tissue composition, i.e. muscle and fat volumes, in young and older adults and the relative importance of individual tissue compartments to the physical function of older adults. A total of 43 older (age 78.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6\u00a0years) and 20 younger (age 23.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9\u00a0years) healthy men and women participated in the study. Older participants were further classified as either high- (HF) or low-functioning (LF) according to the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Magnetic resonance images were used to determine the volumes of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous fat (SAT), and intermuscular fat (IMAT) in the thigh (femoral) and calf (tibiofibular) regions. After adjusting for the sex of participants, younger participants had more femoral muscle mass than older adults (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for between group differences) as well as less femoral IMAT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and tibiofibular IMAT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Femoral muscle was the only tissue compartment demonstrating a significant difference between the two older groups, with HF participants having 31% more femoral muscle mass than LF participants (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a0103.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034.0\u00a0cm3; p\u00a0=\u00a00.011).

     "abstract": "A senescent phenotype in endothelial cells is associated with increased apoptosis, reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inflammation, which are implicated in arterial dysfunction and disease in humans. We tested the hypothesis that changes in microRNAs are associated with a senescent phenotype in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Compared with early-passage HAEC, late-passage HAEC had a reduced proliferation rate and increased staining for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase and the tumor suppressor p16INK4a. Late-passage senescent HAEC had reduced expression of proliferation-stimulating/apoptosis-suppressing miR-21, miR-214 and miR-92 and increased expression of tumor suppressors and apoptotic markers. eNOS-suppressing miR-221 and miR-222 were increased and eNOS protein and eNOS activation (phosphorylation at serine1177) were lower in senescent HAEC. Caveolin-1 inhibiting miR-133a was reduced and caveolin-1, a negative regulator of eNOS activity, was elevated in senescent HAEC. Inflammation-repressing miR-126 was reduced and inflammation-stimulating miR-125b was increased, whereas inflammatory proteins were greater in senescent HAEC. Development of a senescent arterial endothelial cell phenotype featuring reduced cell proliferation, enhanced apoptosis and inflammation and reduced eNOS is associated with changes in miRNAs linked to the regulation of these processes. Our results support the hypothesis that miRNAs could play a critical role in arterial endothelial cell senescence.",

Moreover, the pesticide induces an imbalance in glutamate, calcium and NO in hippocampus. Low calcium concentrations in leukocytes and in plasma were observed, while increased NO and decreased SOD plasma levels were measured.The results suggest that permethrin intake at a dose close to the NOAEL (25\u00a0mg/kg) during the perinatal period can interact with Nurr1 by reducing its expression on striatum nucleus. Consequently, the maintenance of dopaminergic neurons as well as Nurr1 inhibitory effect on the production of proinflammatory mediators fails.The changes in biological markers found in our animal model could represent the basis to study neurodegenerative diseases whose development depends on individual gene signature and life style.",

Thus, in the present study, the open field motor behavior and adhesive tape removal motor performance as well as the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) of NSDA system were examined in aged male rats following chronic subcutaneous injections of testosterone propionate (TP). Aged rats showed significantly reduced open field motor behavior and adhesive tape removal motor performance compared to adult rats. Chronic TP supplement significantly ameliorated the age-related motor deficits. The expression of TH and DAT of NSDA system was significantly enhanced in TP-treated aged rats revealed by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis respectively.

     "abstract": "The intracellular levels of oxidant and antioxidant balances are gradually distorted during the aging process. An age associated elevation of oxidative stress occurring throughout the lifetime is hypothesized to be the major cause of aging. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the putative antioxidant activity of the fermented Panax ginseng extract (GINST) on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status of major organs of aged rats compared to young rats. Increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), urea and creatinine were observed in the serum of aged rats. Increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and significantly lowered activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were observed in the liver, kidneys, heart and lungs of aged rats, when compared with those in young rats. Quantitative analysis of the non-enzymatic antioxidants such as reduced glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid and \u03b1-tocopherol levels showed significantly lower values in the liver, kidneys, heart and lungs of aged rats. On the other hand, administration of the fermented Panax ginseng extract (GINST) to aged rats resulted in increased activities of SOD, CAT, GPx, GR and GST as well as elevation in GSH, ascorbic acid and \u03b1-tocopherol levels. Besides, the level of MDA, AST, ALT, urea and creatinine were reduced on administration of GINST to aged rats. These results suggested that treatment of GINST can improve the antioxidant status during aging, thereby minimizing the oxidative stress and occurrence of age-related disorders associated with free radicals.",

     "abstract": "Older adults are less fatigable than young during isometric tasks, but this apparent ability to resist fatigue is often abolished when dynamic actions are performed. These findings could indicate that the velocity component of dynamic contractions or the task performed is an important factor in explaining fatigability of older adults. However, it has not been evaluated systematically. The purpose was to investigate the differences in age-related fatigue of the knee extensors in 8 older (73.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0years) and 8 younger (25.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0years) men. Neuromuscular measures were collected at baseline, during and immediately following task termination of three different maximal effort knee extension tasks. On three separate days, participants performed either 30 slow (1.05\u00a0rad\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01, 60\u00b0\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01) or 30 moderate (3.14\u00a0rad\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01, 180\u00b0\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01) isovelocity contractions, or 30 fast unconstrained velocity contractions with a fixed resistance (i.e., 20% maximal voluntary isometric contraction). At baseline, the older men were 25% and 35% less powerful than the younger men for the slow and moderate isovelocity tasks, respectively, but 42% less for the fast unconstrained velocity protocol. At task termination for the slow (old: 53%, young: 53%) and moderate (old: 45%, young: 38%) isovelocity fatigue tasks, power was reduced similarly in both age groups. However, for the fast unconstrained velocity task, power was reduced by a greater extent in older (35%) than the younger men (23%) at task termination. These results highlight that age-related impairments in voluntary shortening velocity exacerbate reductions in power production during repetitive dynamic tasks. Furthermore, the importance of this factor is masked when velocity is constrained (isovelocity) and fatigue is dependent primarily upon slow torque generation.",

Our results demonstrated that old rats had lower muscle mass, higher levels of total non-heme iron and oxidative damage in skeletal muscle in comparison with young rats. Non-heme iron concentrations and total non-heme iron amounts were 3.4- and 2.3-fold higher in aged rats as compared with their young counterparts, respectively. Seven and 14\u00a0days of re-loading was associated with higher muscle weights in young animals as compared with age-matched HS rats, but there was no difference in muscle weights among aged HS, 7 and 14\u00a0days of re-loading rats, indicating that aged rats may have a lower adaptability to muscle disuse and a lower capacity to recover from muscle atrophy. Protein levels of cellular iron transporters, such as divalent metal transport-1 (DMT1), transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), Zip14, and ferroportin (FPN), and their mRNA abundance were determined. TfR1 protein and mRNA levels were significantly lower in aged muscle. Seven and 14\u00a0days of re-loading were associated with higher TfR1 mRNA and protein levels in young animals in comparison with their age-matched HS counterparts, but there was no difference between cohorts in aged animals, suggesting adaptive responses in the old to cope with iron deregulation. The extremely low expression of FPN in skeletal muscle might lead to inefficient iron export in the presence of iron overload and play a critical role in age-related iron accumulation in skeletal muscle. Moreover, oxidative stress was much greater in the muscles of the older animals measured as 4-hydroxy-2-nonhenal (HNE)-modified proteins and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine levels. These markers remained fairly constant with either HS or re-loading in young rats. In old rats, HNE-modified proteins and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine levels were markedly higher in HS and were lower after 7\u00a0days of recovery. However, no difference was observed following 14\u00a0days of recovery between control and re-loading animals. In conclusion, advanced age is associated with disruption of muscle iron metabolism which is further perturbed by disuse and persists over a longer time period.",

In this study we investigated the associations between inflammatory markers, candidate polymorphisms and physical performance in elderly people. Plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, sICAM-1 and candidate polymorphisms were measured in 600 twin individuals aged 73\u00a0years and older participating in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. Physical performance was assessed using a self-reported measure. The inclusion of twins allowed both traditional and within-twin-pair analysis which permitted control for shared environment and genetic factors. Higher levels of inflammatory markers were generally associated with a lower level of physical performance. The TNF\u03b1-238G/A polymorphism was significantly associated with physical performance in men, with A allele carriers having significantly better performance than GG homozygotes. However, this gene variation seems to have only a minor role in explaining the associations between the levels of inflammatory markers and physical performance. When using twin pair analysis to test whether genetic factors in general account for this association, results showed that the association between the level of fibrinogen and physical performance could be caused by genetic factors. Also the association between the level of TNF-\u03b1 and physical performance in males could be caused by genetic factors.

Both, the upstream signalling pathway of He-PC and the underlying mechanisms for an age-related loss of preconditioning are unknown. A possible candidate as upstream regulator of mKCa channels is protein kinase A (PKA).We investigated whether 1) regulation of PKA is involved in He-PC and 2) regulation of PKA is age-dependent.Young (2\u20133\u00a0months) and aged (22\u201324\u00a0months) Wistar rats were randomised to eight groups (each n\u00a0=\u00a08). All animals underwent 25\u00a0min regional myocardial ischemia and 120\u00a0min reperfusion. Control (Con, Age Con) animals were not further treated. Young rats inhaled 70% helium for 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05min (He-PC). The PKA-blocker H-89 (10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) was administered with and without helium (He-PC\u00a0+\u00a0H-89, H-89). Furthermore, we tested the effect of direct activation of mKCa channels with NS1619. The adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (For) was administered in young (300\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) and aged animals (300 and 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/kg).He-PC reduced infarct size from 60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04% (Con) to 37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Infarct size reduction was completely abolished by H-89 (58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but H-89 alone had no effect (57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02%).

Vitamin D in baseline samples was measured by chemiluminescence methods. Additional information was obtained by standardised questionnaires.In multiple linear regression adjusted for important confounders, women in the lowest sex-specific quintile of vitamin D showed an on average 2.1 (95% confidence interval: 0.4 to 3.9) units lower COGTEL score than women in the highest quintile. A similar, albeit slightly weaker, association was seen in males (difference of 1.7 [\u2212\u00a00.4 to 3.8] units). Spline regression suggested non-linearity with a distinct decline in cognitive performance in the lower range of vitamin D levels.Our findings support suggestions that low levels of vitamin D may be associated with reduced cognitive functioning in the elderly.",

     "abstract": "Muscle aging is a key component of the increase in frailty in human populations. The generation of critical levels of power is a prerequisite to perform simple tasks of daily living, such as rising from a chair or climbing stairs. There is great scientific and social interest to determine which behaviors can lead to the maintenance of the muscle mass in young immobilized subjects and in the elderly. Several hormonal treatments have been proposed for the treatment of sarcopenia. However, the side effects associated to these treatments emphasize the need of finding non-toxic and non-hormonal treatments that help increase muscle strength, improve muscle function, and decrease the degree of dependency in the old population. Recently, several studies have shed new light on this topic. Any medical efforts to develop treatments to prevent muscle dysfunction leading to sarcopenia, and eventually frailty, will be a major breakthrough in the public health in advances countries. Moreover, any significant improvement in the loss of muscle function will be a major breakthrough in the health and welfare of the population.",

     "abstract": "The life cycle of Nothobranchius korthausae, a Cyprinodontiformes fish, was studied in our laboratory to characterise the ageing process. Some morphological changes, such as spine curvature, skin colour, and fin and eye appearance are described. Growth and survival curves reflected a fast life cycle with rapid initial growth until 4\u00a0weeks of age, after which the fish grew more slowly before reaching their final size in week 40. Senescence onset was established at week 48 with a decrease in spawn size and viability and a general decline in the animal's appearance (weight and colouration losses, caudal fin degradation, and cataractogenesis). The fatty acid composition changed with age, with high unsaturation in the adult stage as reflected by a high peroxidation index, a condition that is associated with high susceptibility to oxidative damage if elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production occurs. Senescent fish had an increase in monounsaturated fatty acid proportions and a lower peroxidation index (226.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.7 in adults versus 120.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.1 in senescent fish, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The circadian system, as reflected by locomotor activity rhythms, showed noticeable changes with age. Twenty-four-week-old fish (adults) had a robust diurnal rhythm that showed a decrease in total activity, an increase in rhythm fragmentation, and a fall in amplitude and regularity with age. Changes were clearly reflected in the Circadian Function Index variations (0.56, 0.47 and 0.25 at 24, 48 and 72\u00a0weeks of age, respectively). In conclusion, N. korthausae appears to be a species with appropriate characteristics for ageing studies because it manifests clear signs of progressive ageing. Comparing species of Nothobranchius genus with different lifespans may be useful for increasing our understanding of the ageing process.",

I focus on the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants to explore whether the phenomenon of inter-chromosomal LD can be caused by non-stochastic bio-genetic mechanisms in the human genome and be associated with complex, polygenic phenotypes. This paper documents remarkably strong and extensive LD among SNPs at loci on multiple non-homologous chromosomes genotyped using two independent (Affymetrix 50\u00a0K and 500\u00a0K) arrays. The analyses provided compelling evidences that the observed inter-chromosomal LD was unlikely generated by stochasticity, population or family structure, or mis-genotyping. The analyses show that this LD is associated with complex heritable phenotypes characterizing poor health. The inter-chromosomal LD was observed in parental and offspring generations of the FHS participants. These findings suggest that inter-chromosomal LD can be caused by bio-genetic mechanisms possibly associated with favorable or unfavorable epistatic evolution. This phenomenon can challenge our understanding of the role of genes and gene networks in regulating complex, polygenic phenotypes in humans.",

Expression levels of tPA mRNA were significantly decreased and those of TF were significantly elevated throughout the day in the brain of aged mice. Expression levels of PAI-1 in the heart of aged mice were continuously elevated over 2-fold the peak levels of young mice throughout the day. However, day/night fluctuations in plasma PAI-1 levels were unaffected by aging. Aging tissue- and time-dependently affects the mRNA expression of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors.

However, in Poland and other Central\u2013Eastern European countries, such comprehensive, nationally representative, multidimensional studies were never performed in the past in elderly population. The present paper describes the PolSenior project including its objectives, sample selection and structure, methods, fieldwork procedures and study flow. The aim of the project was to examine medical, psychological and socioeconomic aspects of aging in Poland. The research sample included 5695 respondents (2899 males and 2796 females) split into six equally sized age groups of elderly individuals (65\u201369 years, 70\u201374 years, 75\u201379 years, 80\u201384 years, 85\u201389\u00a0years, 90\u00a0+\u00a0years) and one group of subjects just about to enter old age (55-59 years). Subjects were recruited using three stage stratified, proportional draw. The response rate was 42% and ranged from 32% to 61% between provinces. The study consisted of three visits performed by trained nurses including questionnaire survey, comprehensive geriatric assessment and blood and urine sampling. The questionnaire consisted of medical and specific socioeconomic questions. The comprehensive geriatric assessment included blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, as well as selected scales and tests routinely used in the examination of elderly subjects. Blood and urine samples were collected from 4737 and 4526 individuals, respectively. More than 50 biochemical parameters were measured, and DNA was isolated and banked. In a selected group of 1018 subjects, a medical examination by a physician was performed. The self-rated health was lower in females than in males in age groups 70\u201384, but similar in individuals of both sexes aged 65-69 and \uf0b3 85 years. Besides providing data on health and functioning of elderly population, the PolSenior project aims to analyze interrelationships between different elements of health and social status, and between genetics and health status in advanced age. The results of the PolSenior project will facilitate prioritizing the state's public health and social policies in elderly population. Such a program provides also an excellent starting point for longitudinal studies and a basis for comparative analysis between Poland and other European countries or regions.",

Study of genetic variants in the IL1 genes has been mostly limited to diseases such as Alzheimer's, however, there may be benefit to studying a continuous measure of cognition. Using data from the Cardiovascular Health Study, we evaluate genetic variation in the genes encoding inflammatory agonists IL1A and IL1B, and the antagonist IL1RN, with repeated measures of global cognition (3MS) and processing speed (DSST), using mixed effects models. We found statistically significant minor allele SNP associations with baseline performance on the 3MS in the IL1RN gene for Caucasians (rs17042917: beta\u00a0=\u00a00.47, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.09, 0.85, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016; rs4251961: beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.36, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.13,\u22120.60, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0027; rs931471: beta\u00a0=\u00a00.39, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.13, 0.65, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0032), and the IL1B gene for African Americans (rs1143627: beta\u00a0=\u00a01.6, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.48, 2.8; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006 and rs1143634: beta\u00a0=\u00a02.09, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.39, 3.8; p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). Associations appear to be weaker in a subgroup with higher education level. Upon removing those diagnosed with dementia, effect sizes and statistical significance attenuated.

We performed an [11C]-DASB microPET study to evaluate the effects of aging on 5-HTT availability in the rat brain. To generate binding potential estimates, quantitative tracer kinetic modeling was applied using the simplified reference tissue model. A global increase in whole-brain [11C]-DASB binding potential was observed in the aged rats in comparison to the control group. More specifically, regional analyses revealed a highly significant increase in 5-HTT binding in the medial frontal cortex, and more modest increments in the midbrain/thalamus. Our results suggest that the frontal cortex represents a site of robust age-related alterations in the rat serotonergic system, and stress the need for further research assessing this topic in the human frontal cortex.

The change in spatial memory was assessed with Morris Water Maze (MWM), and the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was detected, and the levels of hippocampal glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (p-GSK-3\u03b2) phosphorylation at serine 9 and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) were measured. The MWM detection showed that both swimming latency and distance were considerably prolonged by the surgeries, but these changes could be markedly shortened by prophylactic lithium administration. Meanwhile, the changes in the hippocampal PI3K cascades and p-GSK-3\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 expression displayed corresponding changes that were parallel to the alterations of spatial memory, and inhibition of PI3K and GSK-3\u03b2 suggested upstream PI3K activation leads to downstream change in p-GSK-3\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2. These results indicate, at least in part, that prophylactic lithium can alleviate surgery-associated impairment of the spatial memory in aged rats which is strongly associated with the reduced levels of hippocampal p-GSK-3\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 resulted from the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTORC2 pathway.",

Recent discoveries support the notion that an altered mitochondrial proteome induces mitohormesis. Mitohormesis involves a variety of ROS during several growth stages and extends lifespan in yeast and other organisms. Here we recap recent advances in understanding of ROS as signals that decelerate chronological aging in yeast. We also discuss parallels between yeast and worm hypoxic signaling.

In Drosophila, expression of a variety of immune-related genes elevates during ageing; however how this is linked to increasing pathogen susceptibility in older flies has remained unclear. We investigated whether changes in the Drosophila cellular immune response might contribute to immunosenescence. Experiments studied fly cohorts of different ages and compared the numbers and activity of the circulating haemocytes involved in pathogen defence. In female wildtype Samarkand and Oregon R flies the haemocyte population fell by 31.8% and 10.2% respectively during the first four weeks of adulthood. Interestingly we detected no such decline in male flies. The impact of ageing on the phagocytic activity of haemocytes was investigated by injecting flies with fluorescently labelled microbes or latex beads and assessing the ability of haemocytes to engulf them. For all immune challenges the proportion of actively phagocytosing haemocytes decreased as flies aged. Whilst 24.3%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.15% of haemocytes in one-week-old flies phagocytosed Escherichia coli bacteria or Beauveria bassiana fungal spores, this decreased to 16.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.99% in four-week-old flies.

In addition, we examined the mechanisms by which H2O2 induces autophagy in WI38 cells. Our results revealed that H2O2 increases autophagy independent of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) negative feedback pathway.

     "abstract": "The objective of this study is to clarify whether age-related oxidative stress enhances hepatic vulnerability via increased interaction of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) with their receptor RAGE. To further address the role of uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 wild-type (UCP2+/+) and knock out (UCP2\u2212/\u2212) mice were used and studied at an age of 8 (young), 38 (adult) and 76\u00a0weeks (senescent). First, we could show that UCP2 protein expression increased with age in UCP2+/+ mice. Second, in both mouse strains oxidative stress, as measured by malondialdehyde concentrations and the ratio of glutathione to glutathione disulfide, as well as hepatic RAGE expression and highly modified AGE accumulation significantly increased with age. This, however, was far more pronounced in UCP2\u2212/\u2212 mice, in particular at the young age of 8\u00a0wk. In addition, the hepatic activity of the AGE precursor detoxifying enzyme glyoxalase-I was significantly decreased in 8\u00a0wk old UCP2\u2212/\u2212 animals and concomitantly caused 2-fold higher levels of methylglyoxal-modified AGE in these animals. We further showed that the numbers of hepatic cells expressing sRAGE which acts as a decoy for RAGE ligands decreased with age and were markedly lower in the UCP2\u2212/\u2212 than the UCP2+/+ mice. As a consequence, young 8\u00a0wk old UCP2\u2212/\u2212 mice benefited from treatment with recombinant mouse RAGE to block the RAGE/AGE interaction, when challenged with galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide for the induction of acute liver injury. They showed less pronounced tissue damage and slightly lower mortality rate, while older UCP2+/+ and UCP2\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed comparably high mortality rates and extent of liver injury, irrespective of their treatment with rRAGE. Taken together, the present study underlines the role of UCP2 in the age-related increase of oxidative stress and the oxidative stress-related RAGE/AGE interaction. In young animals, blockade of the RAGE/AGE interaction is of benefit, while in older animals, this protective effect is lost, supposedly due to the fact that with age other factors than enhanced hepatic glycation products predominantly determine liver injury and injury-related mortality rate.",

     "abstract": "Aging is associated to a decline in immune functions that are in part related to a defective protein kinase C dependent signal transduction machinery. RACK-1 (Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1) is a scaffold protein for different kinases and membrane receptors. We have previously demonstrated, in the elderly, a defective PCK\u03b2II (Protein Kinase C \u03b2II) translocation related to a decrease in RACK-1 protein expression, which is correlated to the age-associated decline in DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) levels. As a consequence of this signal transduction impairment, a significant decrease in immune cells functionality was observed. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that in vivo and in vitro DHEA administration restored RACK-1 level and immune functions, indicating that this hormone behaved as a positive RACK-1 regulator.We have most recently characterized the human GNB2L1 promoter region, coding for RACK-1 protein. Although no direct DHEA responsive elements were found, a glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE) was identified.The purpose of this work was to investigate, in the human pro-myelocytic cell line THP-1, whether physiological cortisol concentrations were able to modulate GNB2L1 promoter activity, RACK-1 transcription as well as cytokine production. As DHEA is endowed of anti-glucocorticoid properties in several cellular systems, and as cortisol:DHEA ratio imbalance is relevant in aging, we also investigated their possible interaction at the RACK-1 expression level.We could demonstrate that cortisol acted in a dose-related manner as a GNB2L1 promoter repressor, reducing RACK-1 mRNA expression and protein level. Probably by interfering with glucocorticoid receptor binding to GRE sequence, prolonged DHEA exposure counteracted cortisol effects, restoring RACK-1 levels and cytokine production, as assessed by LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 release.",

Thereafter participants undertook a supervised program of RET (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015 MVCs 3\u00d7 wk/12\u00a0wk). We measured knee extensor muscle volume, fatty infiltration, and mechanical muscle quality before and after RET.Before RET, older women were ~\u00a030% weaker (MVC 208 vs. 297\u00a0N) and had ~\u00a040% less quadriceps muscle (0.97 vs. 1.54\u00a0L) with greater fatty infiltration (14% vs. 10%). The most notable difference in mRNA expression after RE was for regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) (an endogenous suppressor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling), which was depressed (\u2212\u00a080%), but only in young women. Moreover, adaptive responses to RET were blunted in older women with respect to increases in muscle volume (+\u00a02.5% (old) vs. +\u00a06.2% (young)) and strength (+\u00a016% (old) vs. +\u00a027% (young)).Adaptations to RET are markedly blunted in older women, perhaps in-part due to the inability to downregulate REDD1 and thus upregulate mTOR signaling after RE.",

Age-dependent decline of NHEJ activity was apparent in the lung, liver, and kidney and appeared to be slightly decreased in spleen. CR reduced age-dependent decline of NHEJ activity in all tissues, even though the extent of recovery was variable among tissues. Moreover, CR appeared to reduce age-dependent decline of XRCC4 protein level. These results suggest that CR could reduce age-dependent decline of NHEJ activity in various tissues of rats possibly through up-regulation of XRCC4.",

Thermogenesis has potential implications for body mass control and cellular fat metabolism. In fact, in humans, the variability of the UCP1 gene is associated with obesity, fat gain and metabolism. Since regulation of metabolism is one of the key-pathways in lifespan extension, we tested the possible effects of UCP1 variability on survival.Two polymorphisms (A-3826G and C-3740A), falling in the upstream promoter region of UCP1, were analyzed in a sample of 910 subjects from southern Italy (475 women and 435 men; age range 40\u2013109). By analyzing haplotype specific survival functions we found that the A-C haplotype favors survival in the elderly. Consistently, transfection experiments showed that the luciferase activity of the construct containing the A-C haplotype was significantly higher than that containing the G-A haplotype. Interestingly, the different UCP1 haplotypes responded differently to hormonal stimuli. The results we present suggest a correlation between the activity of UCP1 and human survival, indicating once again the intricacy of mechanisms involved in energy production, storage and consumption as the key to understanding human aging and longevity.",

We and others have shown previously that adenosine signalling via A1 receptors is involved in cochlear protection from noise-induced cochlear injury. Here we demonstrate that enhanced adenosine signalling in the cochlea provides partial protection from ARHL in C57BL/6J mice. We targeted adenosine kinase (ADK), the key enzyme in adenosine metabolism, using a treatment regime with the selective ADK inhibitor ABT-702 (1.5\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneally twice a week) commencing at the age of three months or six months. This treatment, intended to increase free adenosine levels in the cochlea, was maintained until the age of nine months and hearing thresholds were evaluated monthly using auditory brainstem responses (ABR). At nine months, when C57BL/6J mice normally exhibit significant ARHL, both groups treated with ABT-702 showed lower ABR threshold shifts at 10 and 16\u00a0kHz compared to control animals receiving the vehicle solution. The better thresholds of the ABT-702-treated mice at these frequencies were supported by increased survival of hair cells in the apical region of the cochlea. This study provides the first evidence that ARHL can be mitigated by enhancing adenosine signalling in the cochlea.",

Male and female rat brain from four different age groups (6, 12, 18 and 24\u00a0months old) were analyzed. Oxidative damage accumulates in rat brain throughout aging, related to the increasing activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) and failure of several antioxidant defenses. The aging effect was less marked in females, which accumulated less oxidative damage than males due in part to their greater antioxidant capacity, such as higher GPx activity and higher UCP5 level. This sexual dimorphism gradually increased during aging.",

A biological sample, preferably a blood sample, was collected from each participant, and basic physical and cognitive measures were obtained together with information about health, life style, and family composition.From 2004 to 2008 a total of 2535 families comprising 5319 nonagenarian siblings were identified and included in the project. In addition, 2548 younger control persons aged 50\u201375\u00a0years were recruited. A total of 2249 complete trios with blood samples from at least two old siblings and the younger control were formed and are available for genetic analyses (e.g. linkage studies and genome-wide association studies).Mortality follow-up improves the possibility of identifying families with the most extreme longevity phenotypes. With a mean follow-up time of 3.7\u00a0years the number of families with all participating siblings aged 95\u00a0years or more has increased by a factor of 5 to 750 families compared to when interviews were conducted.

Female Wistar rats of 3- and 12-months of age received a daily oral supplement of GSPE until they attained 6- and 15-months of age. During this period, rats were tested for their cognitive ability. At the end of this period, blood glucose and markers of OS were assessed in the hippocampus. GSPE lowered blood glucose, lipid peroxidation, hydrogen peroxide level, and increased protein sulphydryl (P-SH) content in the hippocampus. In addition, GSPE significantly improved cognitive performance in the two age groups. These results demonstrate that the extent of OS-related LF accumulation is reducible by GSPE. They also suggest a critical role for GSPE as a neuroprotectant in the hippocampus and in preventing cognitive loss with aging.",

We performed a comprehensive examination of oxidative stress in the kidneys of male rats with (experienced) or without (na\u00efve) reproductive activity during aging. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase, and by measuring protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, nitrite and nitrate levels, vitamin C levels, and glutathione (total, reduced, and oxidized forms) levels, and metabolism was accessed by aconitase activity in kidney tissue, as well as testosterone and estradiol levels in serum. Reproductively active animals exhibited increased testosterone levels and altered metabolism. Aging affects tissues and organs and contributes to their functional decline. Elderly na\u00efve rats showed high nitrite and nitrate levels. The experienced rats had less damage in elderly ages, probably because they had higher antioxidant amount and antioxidant enzyme activities at earlier ages, which would have avoided oxidative damage seen in na\u00efve group, and because of the metabolism decline. Glutathione increase in na\u00efve elder rats probably was induced for direct protection against oxidative damage and indirect protection by higher glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase activities. Linear regression shows that lipid peroxidation levels explained vitamin C levels (B standardized value of 0.42), indicating that vitamin C was properly produced or recruited into kidneys to combat lipid peroxidation. Catalase activity reflected the protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation levels (B standardized values of 0.28 and 0.48).

Females undergoing DR typically experience a reduction in their fecundity, which raises the question of whether the two treatments are actually extending life span in overlapping ways. Life span in lubber grasshoppers has been shown to be increased by DR, and separately by ovariectomy (OVX). Here, we test the combination of these on life span. If life extension by the two treatments are additive, it would suggest that they likely act through separate pathways. The experimental groups were: fully reproductive and fully fed (ShamFD); ovariectomized and fully fed (OVX\u00a0FD); fully reproductive and restricted diet (ShamDR); and ovariectomized and restricted diet (OVX\u00a0DR).

In addition, hemolymph total anti-oxidant activity (per \u03bcg protein) was significantly reduced by OVX, but was not affected by DR. We show that OVX and DR produce different physiological responses in grasshoppers, despite life extensions and feeding levels that were not significantly different.

Sixteen SAMP8 male mice (aged 8\u00a0months) were randomly divided into model group and acupuncture treatment group while the later group received EA treatment for 21\u00a0days. Eight senescence-resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice were used as the control group. Morris water maze was used to evaluate the effects of EA. All mice plasma samples obtained from different groups were analyzed by using 600\u00a0MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonances (1H NMR) spectroscopy. The data sets were analyzed by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) to discriminate the key plasma metabolites among different groups. Results indicated that both the escape and probe tasks of SAMP8 could be improved by EA treatment. Metabonomic study showed that SAMR1 and SAMP8 were separated clearly in both CPMG_OSC_PLS and LED _OSC_PLS score plots. Interestingly, samples obtained from EA group were distributed closely to SAMR1 group in CPMG_OSC_PLS score plot, but away from SAMP8 group in LED_OSC_PLS score plot. Corresponding loading plots showed that much less lactate was seen in SAMP8 mice plasma. Other changes including higher levels of dimethylamine (DMA) Choline and \u03b1-glucose but lower levels of leucine/isoleucine, HDL, LDL/VLDL, 3-Hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), and Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) were observed in the SAMP8 mice plasma than in the SAMR1. After EA treatment, the levels of lactate, DMA, choline and TMAO were improved. Results of this work can provide valuable clues to the understanding of the metabolic changes in the senile impairment of mice. It is also hoped that the methodology can be used in evaluating the effects of EA and understanding the underlying acupuncture mechanism in treating neurodegenerative diseases.",

     "abstract": "Variation in life history can reflect genetic differences, and may be caused by environmental effects on phenotypes. Understanding how these two sources of life history variation interact to express an optimal allocation of resources in a changing environment is central to life history theory. This study addresses variation in the allocation of resources to asexual reproduction and to maintenance of Hydra magnipapillata in relation to differences in temperature and food availability. Hydra is a non-senescent, persistent species with primarily clonal reproduction. We recorded changes in budding rate and mean survival under starvation, which indicate changes in the allocation of resources to asexual reproduction and maintenance. In constant conditions we observed a clear trade-off between asexual reproduction and maintenance, where budding increased linearly with food intake while starvation survival stayed rather constant. In contrast, an environment with fluctuations in temperature or food availability promotes maintenance and increases the survival chances of hydra under starvation. Surprisingly, asexual reproduction also tends to be positively affected by fluctuating environmental conditions, which suggests that in this case there is no clear trade-off between asexual reproduction and maintenance in hydra. Environmental stresses have a beneficial impact on the fitness-related phenotypical traits of the basal metazoan hydra. The results indicate that, if the stress occurs in hormetic doses, variable stressful and fluctuating environments can be salutary for hydra. A closer examination of this dynamic can therefore enable us to develop a deeper understanding of the evolution of aging and longevity.",

The purpose of this study was to determine if SR protein content and rates of Ca2+ release and uptake and ATPase activity are lower in the senescent (34\u201336\u00a0mo) Fisher 344\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Brown-Norway F1 hybrid rat heart and if a long-term exercise training program could maintain SR function. Late middle aged (29\u00a0mo) male rats underwent 5\u20137\u00a0mo of treadmill training. Aging resulted in a decrease in SERCA activity and modest decrease in the rate of Ca2+ uptake but no change in Ca2+ release rate. SERCA2a content was not decreased with age but nitrotyrosine accumulation was increased and Ser16 phosphorylated phospholamban (PLN) was decreased. Ryanodine receptor content was not decreased with age but dihydropyridine receptor content was decreased in the senescent heart. Treadmill training had no significant effect on any of the SR properties or protein contents in the senescent rat heart. These results suggest that decreases in Ca2+ uptake and SERCA activity in the senescent F344BN rat heart are due to increased SERCA2a damage from nitrotyrosine accumulation and inhibition by PLN and that exercise training initiated at late middle age is unable to prevent these age-related changes in cardiac SR function.",

Repetitive DNA elements were hypermethylated in the brains of old mice. Histone hypoacetylation and altered histone trimethylation at repetitive sequences were detected in brain tissues during aging. The expression of repeat-derived transcripts (RDTs) was then measured to explore any correlations with the observed epigenetic alterations. Large numbers of RDTs investigated were down-regulated along with age. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that CpG dinucleotide methylation patterns at the repeats of the RDT promoter region were mostly well maintained during aging. ChIP assay showed that histones were deacetylated at the promoter region of RDTs in aged mice brain. The observations indicate that the transcriptional repression of RDTs appears to be related to histone hypoacetylation, but not to DNA hypermethylation at repeat DNA elements in the brains of aged mice.",

We now show that copper's effect on life span is through Fet3p, a copper containing enzyme responsible for high affinity transport of iron into yeast cells. Life span extensions can also be obtained by supplementing the growth medium with 1\u00a0mM ferric chloride. Extension by high iron levels is still dependent on the presence of Fet3p. Life span extension by iron or copper requires growth on media containing glycerol as the sole carbon source, which forces yeast to respire. Yeast grown on glucose containing media supplemented with iron show no extension of life span. The iron associated with cells grown in media supplemented with copper or iron is 1.4\u20131.8 times that of cells grown without copper or iron supplementation. As with copper supplementation, iron supplementation partially rescues the life span of superoxide dismutase mutants.

This process is especially evident in the immune cells, which use free radicals in their functions and suffer a senescent deterioration probably linked to oxygen stress. We hypothesize that oxidative damage and antioxidant imbalance may play a critical role in the immune dysfunction in aging. In the present study, we investigated this hypothesis in aged rats by treatment with alpha-lipoic acid (\u03b1-LA). We studied the effect of \u03b1-LA on immune function by examining immunomodulating factors in the plasma. Then we examined oxidative damage and antioxidant defense systems in the plasma. We found out that immune dysfunction in aged animals is associated with increased oxidative damage and decreased antioxidant status and treatment with \u03b1-LA effectively elevated immune function, decreased oxidative insult and enhanced antioxidant status. These results suggest that \u03b1-LA may be effective in improving immune function in aging through decreasing oxidative damage and revitalizing antioxidants in blood.",

The auditory brainstem response was used as a measure of hearing threshold, and cognitive behavior was evaluated using the Morris water maze. The ultrastructure of synapses was observed with transmission electron microscopy, and the quantity and distribution of the synaptic markers synaptophysin and PSD-95 were observed with immunohistochemistry. The hearing threshold of C57BL/6J mice was significantly higher at 24\u201326\u00a0weeks than at 6\u20138\u00a0weeks, and hearing loss was profound at 42\u201344\u00a0weeks. This was accompanied by progressive degeneration of synapses within the auditory cortex. In contrast, the hearing threshold of CBA/CaJ mice was relatively unchanged at 24\u201326\u00a0weeks of age, and these mice developed only mild hearing loss at 42\u201344\u00a0weeks of age. Interestingly, C57BL/6J, but not CBA/CaJ mice clearly exhibited both decreased performance in the Morris water maze and degeneration of synapses within the hippocampus. We therefore conclude that age-related hearing loss is accompanied by the degeneration of synapses in the hippocampal CA3 region of C57BL/6J mice.",

     "publication date": "09-2011",
     "abstract": "Brain aging is associated to several morphological and functional alterations that influence the evolution and outcome of CNS damage. Acute brain injury such as an excitotoxic insult induces initial tissue damage followed by associated inflammation and oxidative stress, partly attributed to neutrophil recruitment and the expression of oxidative enzymes such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), among others. However, to date, very few studies have focused on how age can influence neutrophil infiltration after acute brain damage. Therefore, to evaluate the age-dependent pattern of neutrophil cell infiltration following an excitotoxic injury, intrastriatal injection of N-methyl-d-aspartate was performed in young and aged male Wistar rats. Animals were sacrificed at different times between 12\u00a0h post-lesion (hpl) to 14\u00a0days post-lesion (dpl). Cryostat sections were processed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) immunohistochemistry, and double labeling for either neuronal cells (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP), perivascular macrophages (ED-2), or microglia/macrophages (tomato lectin histochemistry). Our observations showed that MPO\u00a0+\u00a0cells were observed in the injured striatum from 12 hpl (when maximum values were found) until 7 dpl, when cell density was strongly diminished. However, at all survival times analyzed, the overall density of MPO\u00a0+\u00a0cells was lower in the aged versus the adult injured striatum. MPO\u00a0+\u00a0cells were mainly identified as neutrophils (especially at 12 hpl and 1 dpl), but it should be noted that MPO\u00a0+\u00a0neurons and microglia/macrophages were also found. MPO\u00a0+\u00a0neurons were most commonly observed at 12 hpl and reduced in the aged. MPO\u00a0+\u00a0microglia/macrophages were the main population expressing MPO from 3 dpl, when density was also reduced in aged subjects.These results point to neutrophil infiltration as another important factor contributing to the different responses of the adult and aged brain to damage, highlighting the need of using aged animals for the study of acute age-related brain insults.",

Cardiovascular diseases can be related to various factors including environmental toxicants.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of early life permethrin treatment (1/50 LD50, from 6th to 21st day of life) on heart of adult rats. Increased DNA damage, decreased heart cell membrane fluidity, increased cholesterol content, protein and lipid oxidation were measured in heart cells from adult rats treated with permethrin during the neonatal period with respect to control rats. Moreover, the same group showed higher levels of cholesterol, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, rat-Rantes and IL-10 cytokines and decreased albumin content in plasma. Lower cholesterol levels and perturbation in the phospholipid lateral diffusion together with decreased GSH levels and increased GPx activity were measured in heart mitochondria of the treated group.Our findings support the evidence that the neonatal period has a critical role in the development of heart disease in adulthood. We hypothesize that the alterations observed in adult rats could depend on epigenetic changes that occurred during this period which influence gene expression throughout the rat's life, leading to alterations of certain parameters related to cardiac function.",

In this study we assessed the age-related changes in the temporal processing of acoustical signals in the auditory system of pigmented rats (Long Evans strain). The temporal resolution was investigated in young adult (3\u20134\u00a0months) and old (30\u201334\u00a0months) rats by behavioral and electrophysiological methods: the rats' ability to detect and discriminate gaps in a continuous noise was examined behaviorally, and the amplitude-rate function was assessed for the middle latency response (MLR) to clicks. A worsening of the temporal resolution with aging was observed in the results of all tests. The values of the gap detection threshold (GDT) and the gap duration difference limen (GDDL) in old rats increased about two-fold in comparison with young adult rats. The MLR to a click train in old rats exhibited a significantly faster reduction in amplitude with an increasing stimulation rate in comparison with young adult rats. None of the age-related changes in the parameters characterizing temporal resolution (GDT, GDDL and MLR to a click train) correlated with the degree of the age-related hearing loss. However, the age-related changes in MLR amplitude-rate function correlated with the age-related changes in GDDL, but not with the changes in GDT. The behavioral and electrophysiological data clearly show that aging in rats is accompanied with a pronounced deficit in the temporal processing of acoustical signals that is associated with the deteriorated function of the central auditory system.",

Despite the recent awareness of such public health problems, integrative studies investigating the effects of age on the physiological responses to heat wave thermal conditions remain scarce. Daily rhythmicity of core temperature (Tc) and locomotor activity (LA), as well as parameters representative of energy balance and IGF-1 levels which are involved in the aging process and stress resistance, were monitored in a non-human primate species, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Adult and aged animals, acclimated to long days (LD) or short days (SD), were monitored during 8-day periods of exposure to 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 34\u00a0\u00b0C.Adult animals displayed efficient coping with heat exposure, regardless of the photoperiod. Hence, efficient responses resulted in decrease of energy intake, energy expenditure, IGF-1 levels and LA levels, promoting hyperthermia avoidance. Positive energy balance was maintained and water turnover did not change significantly after heat exposure.In contrast, while aged animals acclimated to LD responded similarly to adults, aged mouse lemurs acclimated to SD showed great difficulties coping with heat exposure. Indeed, in this group, normothermia impairment was associated with increased Tc levels, alterations in daily rhythmicity, negative energy balance and increased IGF-1 levels.Impaired responses to heat exposure were seen in aged mouse lemurs acclimated to SD only. The main effects were observed during diurnal resting periods, suggesting decreased capacities with age to dissipate excess body heat. Taken together, these data highlight daily rhythmicity and IGF-1 pathway as main targets in the impaired response to heat exposure in the elderly.",

It is often suggested that they are able to rejuvenate during fission, regeneration and starvation. These features, together with the rapidly expanding molecular toolset, make planarians such as Schmidtea polychroa and S. mediterranea interesting for ageing research. Yet, the basic demographic and physiological data are lacking or still based on fragmentary observations of one century ago.Here, we present the first longitudinal physiological study of the species S. polychroa. Survival, size and metabolic rate, measured by microcalorimetry, of a cohort of 28 individuals were followed over a period of three years. Sexual maturity was reached during the second month after which the worms continued growing up to 5\u00a0months. This initial growth phase was followed by alternating periods of synchronised growth and degrowth. Although mass-specific metabolic rates declined during the initial growth phase, no changes were found later in life. The absence of metabolic ageing may be explained by the very high rate of cell renewal during homeostasis and alternating phases of degrowth and growth during which tissues are renewed.Surprisingly, all deaths occurred in pairs of worms that were housed in the same culture recipient, suggesting that worms did not die from ageing. Taking into account the metabolic and demographic data, we suggest that S. polychroa shows negligible ageing.Detailed analyses of size and metabolic rate revealed a remarkable biphasic allometric scaling relation. During the initial growth phase (months 1\u20135) the allometric scaling exponent b was 0.86 while later in life, it increased to an unusually large value of 1.17, indicating that mass-specific metabolic rate increases with size in adult S. polychroa.",

To test our hypothesis, we determined the expression and products of PP enzymes aldose reductase (AR) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) in hearts from Fischer 344 aged (26\u00a0months) and young (4\u00a0months) rats subjected to global ischemia followed by reperfusion in the presence or absence of blockers of PP and the measures of ischemic injury and functional recovery were determined. Expression and activities of AR and SDH were significantly higher in aged vs. young hearts, and induction of ischemia further increased AR and SDH activity in the aged hearts. Myocardial ischemic injury was significantly greater in aged vs. young hearts, and blockade of AR reduced ischemic injury and improved cardiac functional recovery on reperfusion in aged hearts. These data indicate that innate increases in activity of the PP enzymes augment myocardial vulnerability to I/R injury in aging, and that blockers of PP protect the vulnerable aging hearts.",

Results on other measures of cortical reactivity, e.g. intracortical inhibition (ICI), are more divergent. Acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors and dopaminergic drugs may increase SAI and ICI in AD. Motor cortical plasticity and connectivity are impaired in AD. TMS/tDCS can induce acute and short-duration beneficial effects on cognitive function, but the therapeutic clinical significance in AD is unclear. Safety of TMS/tDCS is supported by studies to date.TMS/tDCS appears safe in AD, but longer-term risks have been insufficiently considered. TMS holds promise as a physiologic biomarker in AD to identify therapeutic targets and monitor pharmacologic effects. In addition, TMS/tDCS may have therapeutic utility in AD, though the evidence is still very preliminary and cautious interpretation is warranted.",

However the underlying mechanism remains to be explored. The effects of the aqueous extract of FZS on the cognitive functions of the aged mice and the pharmacological basis for its therapeutic efficacy were investigated. The results showed that FZS improved impaired cognitive ability of aged SAMP-8 mice. FZS (2.4, 4.8\u00a0g/kg/d) increased hippocampal neurogenesis and the long-term survival of BrdU-labeled cells without affecting the proportion of BrdU-positive neurons and glial cells. FZS also increased the number of BrdU-positive cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles of 8-month-old SAMP-8 mice. These studies suggest that FZS upregulates neurogenesis by increasing proliferation of neural progenitor cells and prolonging survival of the newborn cells in the hippocampal DG. FZS may be beneficial for the treatment of senile dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease.",

RT was divided in pre-movement-time (PMT, time for stimulus processing) and movement-time (MT, time for motor response completion). RT-performance was significantly worse in elderly compared to young; the slowing was more pronounced for MT than PMT (respectively 101\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0ms and 41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0ms slower, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

During the MT-phase, antagonist muscle co-activation was similar for both groups. It can be concluded that increased antagonist muscle co-activation in elderly persons occurs in an early phase, already before the start of the movement.

Based on the human aging literature, we hypothesized that this constellation of age-related changes is mediated by the medial prefrontal cortex and that it would be observed in aging mice. Toward this end, we performed detailed assessments of cognition, motivation, and motoric behavior in aging mice. We assessed behavioral and cognitive performance in C57Bl/6 mice aged 6, 18, and 24\u00a0months, and followed this with microarray analysis of tissue from the medial prefrontal cortex and analysis of serum cytokine levels. Multivariate modeling of these data suggested that the age-related changes in cognition, motivation, motor performance, and prefrontal immune gene expression were highly correlated. Peripheral cytokine levels were also correlated with these variables, but less strongly than measures of prefrontal immune gene upregulation. To determine whether the observed immune gene expression changes were due to prefrontal microglial cells, we isolated CD11b-positive cells from the prefrontal cortex and subject them to next-generation RNA sequencing. Many of the immune changes present in whole medial prefrontal cortex were enriched in this cell population. These data suggest that, as in humans, cognition, motivation, and motoric performance in the mouse change together with age and are strongly associated with CNS immune gene upregulation.",

     "abstract": "The age-related decline in muscle mass, known as sarcopenia, exhibits a marked acceleration in advanced age. Although many studies have remarked upon the accumulation of very small myofibers, particularly at advanced stages of sarcopenia, the significance of this phenomenon in the acceleration of sarcopenia has never been examined. Furthermore, although mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by a lack of cytochrome oxidase (COX) activity has been implicated in myofiber atrophy in sarcopenia, the contribution of this phenotype to the accumulation of severely atrophied fibers in aged muscles has never been determined. To this end, we examined the fiber size distribution in the slow twitch soleus (Sol) and fast twitch gastrocnemius (Gas) muscles between young adulthood (YA) and senescence (SEN). We also quantified the abundance of COX deficient myocytes and their size attributes to gain insight into the contribution of this phenotype to myofiber atrophy with aging. Our data showed that the progression of muscle atrophy, particularly its striking acceleration between late middle age and SEN, was paralleled by an accumulation of severely atrophic myofibers (\u2264\u00a01000\u00a0\u03bcm2 in size) in both Sol and Gas. On the other hand, we observed no COX deficient myofibers in Sol, despite nearly 20% of the myofibers being severely atrophic. Similarly, only 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06% of all fibers in Gas were COX deficient, and their size was generally larger (2375\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0319\u00a0\u03bcm2) than the severely atrophied myofibers noted above. Collectively, our results suggest that similar processes likely contribute to the acceleration of sarcopenia in both slow twitch and fast twitch muscles, and that COX deficiency is not a major contributor to this phenomenon.",

To investigate this, lifelong endurance trained elderly (ET; n\u00a0=\u00a08) aged 71.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4\u00a0years and untrained elderly subjects (UT; n\u00a0=\u00a07) aged 71.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years, performed a cycling exercise bout at 75% VO2max with vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained before (Pre), immediately after exercise (0h) and at 2\u00a0h of recovery. Capillarization was detected histochemically and oxidative enzyme activities were determined on isolated mitochondria. GLUT4, HKII, Cyt c and VEGF protein expression was measured on muscle lysates from Pre-biopsies, phosphorylation of AMPK and P38 on lysates from Pre and 0h biopsies, while PGC-1\u03b1, VEGF, HKII and TFAM mRNA content was determined at all time points. ET had ~\u00a040% higher PDH, CS, SDH, \u03b1-KG-DH and ATP synthase activities and 27% higher capillarization than UT, reflecting increased skeletal muscle oxidative capacity with lifelong endurance exercise training. In addition, acute exercise increased in UT PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA 11-fold and VEGF mRNA 4-fold at 2\u00a0h of recovery, and AMPK phosphorylation ~\u00a05-fold immediately after exercise, relative to Pre, indicating an ability to adapt metabolically and angiogenically to endurance exercise. However, in ET PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA only increased 5 fold and AMPK phosphorylation ~\u00a02-fold, while VEGF mRNA remained unchanged after the acute exercise bout. P38 increased similarly in ET and UT after exercise.

In a study of 71 community-dwelling older adults, we assessed CMV viral DNA in peripheral monocytes by nested PCR and compared the relationships of detectable CMV DNA and IgG serology with serum levels of neopterin, a marker for monocyte/macrophage-mediated immune activation. The results showed that 52 (73.2%) participants were CMV seropositive, of whom 30 (57.5%) had detectable CMV DNA.

Here we test the hypothesis that E2 treatment improves muscle function and physical activity in aged, ovarian-senescent mice. Plasma E2 levels and vaginal cytology confirmed ovarian senescence in 20-month-old C57BL/6 mice. Mice were then randomly divided into activity groups, having access to a running wheel or not, and further into those receiving E2 or placebo. Placebo-treated mice wheel ran more than E2-treated mice (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), with no difference between treatment groups in cage activities such as time spent being active and ambulation distance (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.55). Soleus muscles from aged mice that wheel ran adapted by getting larger and stronger, irrespective of E2 status (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.02). Soleus muscle fatigue resistance was greater in mice treated with E2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), but maximal isometric tetanic force was not affected (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.79). Because E2 treatment did not improve physical activity or overall muscle function in the aged, ovarian-senescent mice as predicted, a second study was initiated to examine E2 treatment of young adult mice prematurely ovarian senescent from exposure to the chemical, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD). Four-month-old C57BL/6 female mice were dosed with oil (control) or VCD. Vaginal cytology confirmed ovarian senescence in all mice treated with VCD 63\u00a0days after the onset of dosing, and then a subset of the VCD mice received E2 (VCD\u00a0+\u00a0E2). Wheel running distance did not differ among control, VCD, and VCD\u00a0+\u00a0E2 mice (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.34). Soleus muscle concentric, isometric, and eccentric in vitro forces were greater in VCD\u00a0+\u00a0E2 than in VCD mice (P\u00a0<\u00a00.04), indicating beneficial estrogenic effects on muscle function. In general, aged and young mice with senescent ovaries were less responsive to E2 treatment, in terms of physical activities and muscle function, than what has previously been shown for young, ovariectomized mice. These results bring forth the possibility that some component of the residual, follicle-depleted ovarian tissue influences physical activity in mice or that aging diminishes the responsiveness of skeletal muscle and related tissues to E2 treatment.",

In addition, the elevated protein levels of phosphorylated active form of p38 MAPK (phospho-p38 MAPK) with age are tissue-specific.To test this hypothesis, protein levels of phospho-p38 MAPK were determined using Western blot analysis in isolated lung, brain, heart, spleen, kidney and muscle of young (2-month-old) and aged (20-month-old) male C57BL/6J mice. Results show that phospho-p38 MAPK protein levels, not total-p38 MAPK, increased significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, n\u00a0=\u00a08) in lung and brain of 20-month-old mice. The activation of p38 MAPK in other tissues was not altered with age. Immunostaining showed that epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in lung parenchyma were the major cellular sources of phospho-p38 MAPK immunity. As measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in lung homogenates were elevated significantly with age, but there were no differences with age in serum levels except for IL-6. In addition, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were increased notably while TNF-\u03b1 was not different with age in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Furthermore, the oxidant-antioxidant status was evaluated by measuring pro-oxidant malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the activity of reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes (i.e. superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH)) in lung homogenates. The results showed that SOD and GSH decreased with age, while MDA did not change.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that p38 MAPK is activated during lung aging with a corresponding increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and decrease in antioxidant capacity.",

However, little was known about the age-related changes of autophagy in the brain of SAMP8 mice. To better understand the precise relationship between aging, autophagy and neurodegeneration, we explored the time course of cognitive ability, ubiquitin-positive inclusions, ultrastructure of neurons and detected the expression of LC3 and Beclin 1 protein in different brain regions of 2, 7 and 12-month-old SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice. We found that 7 and 12-month-old SAMP8 mice presented cognitive decline and ubiquitinated proteins enhanced. In the hippocampal neurons of 12-month-old SAMP8 mice, lots of dense clumps and autophagic vacuoles were found in the cytoplasm and axons. The LC3-II expression showed an increase in hippocampus and cortex of 7 and 12-month-old SAMP8 mice. The expression of Beclin 1 displayed a significant increase in 7\u00a0months old and a decline in 12\u00a0months old mice.

The activity of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB, and gene expression of proteins in upstream signaling cascades were measured by electro-mobility shift assay (EMSA) and Western blotting. Enalapril and losartan differentially attenuated redox imbalance and the redox-sensitive transcription factor, the NF-\u03baB pathway. Furthermore, stimulation of the NF-\u03baB activation pathway by phosphorylation of p65 was attenuated by both compounds. Moreover, mediation of phosphorylation of p65 by phosphorylation of I\u03baB kinase \u03b1\u03b2 (IKK\u03b1\u03b2) and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK-1), were also inhibited by enalapril and losartan. Finally, both compounds also lowered expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammatory genes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Only losartan lowered levels of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX).

Differences in strain, age and technique of measuring cardiac function differ between experiments, confounding the interpretation of these studies. Additionally, the structural and genetic profile at the onset of heart failure has not been extensively studied. We therefore performed serial echocardiography, which allows repeated assessment of left ventricular (LV) function, on a cohort of the same mice every 3\u00a0months as they aged and demonstrated that LV systolic dysfunction becomes apparent at 18\u00a0months of age. These aging animals had left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, but did not have inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Gene expression profiling of left ventricular tissue demonstrated 40 differentially expressed probesets and 36 differentially expressed gene ontology terms, largely related to inflammation and immunity. At this early stage of cardiac dysfunction, we observed increased cardiomyocyte expression of the pro-apoptotic activated caspase-3, but no actual increase in apoptosis. The aging hearts also have higher levels of anti-apoptotic and autophagic factors, which may have rendered protection from apoptosis. In conclusion, we describe the functional, structural and genetic changes in murine hearts as they first develop cardiomyopathy of aging.",

     "abstract": "Various studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy tends to increase with age and that the observed frequency of heteroplasmy among populations mostly depends on the way it is measured. Therefore, we investigated age-related association on the presence of mtDNA heteroplasmy within the hypervariable segment 1 (HVS-I) in a selected study group. The study group consisted of 300 maternally unrelated Latvians ranging in age from 18 to over 90\u00a0years. To determine the optimal method for mtDNA heteroplasmy detection, three approaches were used: (i) SURVEYOR Mutation Detection Kit, (ii) sequencing and (iii) denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Among the studied individuals, 30.3% were found to be heteroplasmic. The distribution of heteroplasmy statistically significantly increased with individuals' age (17%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.095\u20130.244 in the 18\u201340\u00a0year age group vs. 39%; [CI] 0.294\u20130.487 in the >\u00a090\u00a0year age group). Heteroplasmy occurred in a total of 21 different positions within HVS-I, and was the most frequent at fast-mutated positions 16189, 16304 and 16311. The results indicate that heteroplasmy in HVS-I is relatively common and occurs in a broad spectrum of sites. The above is supported by evidence to eventual increase of the probability of heteroplasmy with age due to specific mitochondrial haplogroup background.",

     "abstract": "We previously proposed a rate theory of chemical reaction as well as a lifespan equation derived by a stochastic fluctuation theory. Both were applied to biodemographic data by C. elegans to quantitatively explain that respiratory activity declines exponentially with age and that it has a physiological decline rate and a finite value (threshold) in advanced age. In this work, using the poikilothermic nature of Caenorhabditis elegans, we demonstrate the further validity of the rate theory of chemical reaction as well as the lifespan equation by changing two methods. First, to test the appropriateness of the lifespan equation from another aspect, lifespan assays were conducted by varying the time interval of observation employing the egl-1 mutant. The results indicate that, as the time interval is reduced, mortality rates gradually approach the force of mortality expected from the fitting equation of the survival curve. Second, based on the dependence of lifespan on the temperature of the culture, the physiological decline rate, and the onset of biodemographic aging, we show that the effective activation energy or energy barrier for aging and lifespan may be closely related to the standard free-energy change of ATP or ADP for a wild type and some lifespan-related mutants of C. elegans.",

     "abstract": "Apolipoprotein D (ApoD), a member of the Lipocalin family, is the gene most up-regulated with age in the mammalian brain. Its expression strongly correlates with aging-associated neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Two homologues of ApoD expressed in the Drosophila brain, Glial Lazarillo (GLaz) and Neural Lazarillo (NLaz), are known to alter longevity in male flies. However, sex differences in the aging process have not been explored so far for these genes. Here we demonstrate that NLaz alters lifespan in both sexes, but unexpectedly the lack of GLaz influences longevity in a sex-specific way, reducing longevity in males but not in females. While NLaz has metabolic functions similar to ApoD, the regulation of GLaz expression upon aging is the closest to ApoD in the aging brain. A multivariate analysis of physiological parameters relevant to lifespan modulation uncovers both common and specialized functions for the two Lipocalins, and reveals that changes in protein homeostasis account for the observed sex-specific patterns of longevity. The response to oxidative stress and accumulation of lipid peroxides are among their common functions, while the transcriptional and behavioral response to starvation, the pattern of daily locomotor activity, storage of fat along aging, fertility, and courtship behavior differentiate NLaz from GLaz mutants. We also demonstrate that food composition is an important environmental parameter influencing stress resistance and reproductive phenotypes of both Lipocalin mutants. Since ApoD shares many properties with the common ancestor of invertebrate Lipocalins, we must benefit from this global comparison with both GLaz and NLaz to understand the complex functions of ApoD in mammalian aging and neurodegeneration.",

In particular, there is evidence that canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) in aged dogs is accompanied by cortical deposition of A\u03b2 peptides and neurodegeneration. Plasma A\u03b2 levels have been examined in humans as putative biomarkers for AD, but to date, no similar studies have been conducted for canine dementia. The aim of the present study was to assess plasma A\u03b21-42 and A\u03b21-40 levels in a blind study using pet dogs that were either successfully aging or exhibiting CDS. The severity of cognitive impairment was assessed using an owner-based questionnaire. On average, young dogs presented significantly higher plasma levels of A\u03b21-42 and A\u03b21-40 than aged, cognitively unimpaired dogs. Notably, among aged dogs, the levels of A\u03b21-42 and the A\u03b242/40 ratio were significantly higher in those showing mild cognitive impairment than in either cognitively unimpaired or severely affected dogs. These results suggest that increased plasma A\u03b21-42 levels and A\u03b242/40 ratio could be a biomarker for canine cognitive dysfunction, which is considered an excellent natural model of early AD.",

The results obtained in the present work revealed that normal aging was associated with significant increases in the activity of monoamine oxidase, lipid peroxidation levels and lipofuscin accumulation in the brains of aging female rats, and a decrease in glucose transporter-4 level and membrane fluidity. Our data showed that estradiol treatment significantly decreased monoamine oxidase activity, lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin accumulation in brain regions of aging rats, and a reversal of glucose transporter-4 levels and membrane fluidity was achieved, therefore it can be concluded from the present findings that estradiol's beneficial effects seemed to arise from its antilipofuscin, antioxidant and antilipidperoxidative effects, implying an overall anti-aging action. The results of this study will be useful for pharmacological modification of the aging process and applying new strategies for control of age related disorders.",

Histologically, the aged cochlea shows degeneration of the stria vascularis, the sensorineural epithelium, and neurons of the central auditory pathways.

     "abstract": "Candidate genes for the regulation of lifespan have emerged from studies that use mutants and genetically manipulated model organisms. However, it is rarely addressed whether these genes contribute to lifespan variation in populations of these species that capture natural standing genetic variation. Here, we explore expression variation in three candidate ageing genes, Indy, sod2, and catalase, in Bicyclus anynana, a butterfly with well understood ecology.We used lines established from natural populations and artificially selected for increased adult starvation resistance. They show a considerable increase in adult lifespan under both starvation and optimal food conditions. We measured adult butterflies of various ages, under a range of optimal and starvation diets, from two selected populations and one unselected control population.In all lines, Indy and catalase are up-regulated in response to starvation while this is not evident for sod2. Under starvation, Indy and catalase are up-regulated in, while this is not evident for sod2. Under optimal food conditions, Indy is down-regulated at a later age, with Indy expression showing relatively high inter-individual variation. We find differences between the selected lines and the unselected line. Under starvation conditions, expression is higher for catalase in one, and for sod2 in both selected lines. Importantly, sod2 expression is also higher in the selected populations under optimal food conditions.We conclude that sod2, but not Indy, is involved in the response to artificial selection for increased starvation resistance. The role of catalase is less clear because of the differences between the two selected lines. Moreover, sod2 appears to be a candidate gene that underpins the genetic correlation between starvation resistance and longevity. Our study indicates that some, but not all, genes identified through mutant screens in other organisms may underpin standing genetic variation for ageing-related traits in stocks of Bicyclus butterflies established from natural populations. Clearly, this needs to be investigated in other organisms as well, especially in the organisms to which mutants screens were applied. This information will narrow down the list of genes that underpin variation in lifespan and ageing in extant populations of organisms, and which may serve as candidate genes in humans.",

Fat volume (FV) and bone volume (BV) of distal femora of young (4\u00a0months) and old (27\u00a0months) Louvain/c (LOU) rats (n\u00a0=\u00a022) were quantified by histology and compared with \u03bcCT images analyzed by an image analysis software (SliceOMatic).We found that for SliceOMatic/\u03bcCT the intra-rater reliability for duplicate measurements was 0.94 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the inter-rater reliability for FV/BV ratio in young and old rats was 98% and 99% respectively. Both methods showed a significant increase (~\u00a02 fold) in the FV/BV ratio in the old rats as compared with their young counterparts (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A significantly higher correlation (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.85) in the old rats was found between our noninvasive method and histology. Furthermore, our noninvasive method showed good agreement with histology.In conclusion, noninvasive quantification of FV/BV ratio using an image analysis software is as reliable as histology for identifying age related marrow fat changes with high inter and intra-rater reliability. These findings provide a new noninvasive method for quantifying marrow fat, which is useful and can be tested not only in animals but also in human studies.",

We now demonstrate that garlic constituent diallyl trisulfide (DATS) increases longevity of Caenorhabditis elegans by affecting the skn-1 pathway. Treatment of worms with 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM DATS increased worm mean lifespan even when treatment is started during young adulthood. To explore the mechanisms involved in the DATS-mediated increase in longevity, we treated daf-2, daf-16, and eat-2 mutants and found that DATS increased the lifespan of daf-2 and daf-16 mutants, but not the eat-2 mutants. Microarray experiments demonstrated that a number of genes regulated by oxidative stress and the skn-1 transcription factor were also changed by DATS treatment. Consistently, DATS treatment leads to the induction of the skn-1 target gene gst-4, and this induction was dependent on skn-1. We also found that the effects of DATS on worm lifespan depend on skn-1 activity in both in the intestine and ASI neurons. Together our data suggest that DATS is able to increase worm lifespan by enhancing the function of the pro-longevity transcription factor skn-1.",

     "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging techniques have allowed for investigations into the mechanisms of age-related deterioration in motor control. This study used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to investigate age related differences in the control of grip force magnitude. Using an event-related design, fMRI scans were completed on 13 older adults, and 13 gender matched younger adults, while using their dominant hand to squeeze a rubber bulb for 4\u00a0s at 10%, 40% or 70% of their maximum voluntary contraction. Both groups were able to match the relative force targets, however the older adults produced significantly lower levels of absolute force. fMRI analysis consisted of a 1) region of interest (ROI) approach to detect differences in selected motor areas within brain and 2) a voxel-wise whole brain comparison to find areas of differential activation that were not defined a priori between the older and younger group. The ROI analysis revealed that despite producing lower levels of absolute force, the older adults showed higher levels of activity predominantly in subcortical structures (putamen, thalamus and cerebellum) when compared to the younger group. The older adults also showed higher levels of activity in the ipsilateral ventral premotor cortex. A total of 19 of the 22 ROIs analyzed showed a significant main effect of the required force-level. In the majority of the ROIs that showed a significant force effect there were no significant differences in the magnitude of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal between the 10% and 40% conditions but a significantly higher BOLD signal in the 70% condition, suggesting that the modulation of brain activation with grip force may not be controlled in a linear fashion. It was also found that the older adult group demonstrate higher levels of activation in 7 areas during a force production task at higher force levels using a voxel-wise analysis. The 7 clusters that showed significant differences tended to be areas that are involved in visual\u2013spatial and executive processing. The results of this study revealed that older adults require significantly higher activation of several areas to perform the same motor task as younger adults. Higher magnitudes of the BOLD signal in older adults may represent a compensatory pattern to counter age related deterioration in motor control systems.",

In the renal cortex of 3-month old SHR increases in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were accompanied by augmented expression of NADPH oxidase subunit Nox4 and decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes SOD1 and SOD3. A further increase in renal H2O2 production and urinary TBARS was observed in 12-month old WKY and SHR as compared with 3-month old rats. Similarly, expressions of NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox, SOD2 and SOD3 were markedly elevated with age in both strains. When compared with age-matched WKY, catalase expression was increased in 3-month old SHR, but unchanged in 12-month old SHR. Body weight increased with aging in both rat strains, but this increase was more pronounced in WKY.

     "abstract": "An increase in oxidative chemical modifications of tissue proteins by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs) has been implicated in normal aging. Pyridoxamine (PM), one of the three natural forms of vitamin B6, has been identified as an inhibitor of AGE/ALE products formed during the autoxidation of carbohydrates and peroxidation of lipids. The current study seeks to determine whether PM intervention could prevent the age-related aortic stiffening and vascular resistance through its ability to inhibit the pathogenic cross-linking of glycated collagen. Male Fisher 344 rats at 15\u00a0months were treated daily with PM (1\u00a0g\u00a0l\u2212\u00a01 in drinking water) for 5\u00a0months and compared with the age-matched, untreated controls at 20\u00a0months. Pulsatile aortic pressure and flow signals were measured to perform the vascular impedance analysis. The anti-AGE antibody 6D12 was used to detect glycation-derived modification of aortic collagen, using protein blotting analysis. PM therapy attenuated the age-related increase in total peripheral resistance. An increase in wave transit time and aortic compliance by PM indicated that the drug improved aortic distensibility of the aged vasculature. This paralleled its reduction of AGE-collagen cross-links on aortas.

However, in addition to atherosclerosis, apoE-KO mice develop extensive cutaneous xanthomatosis, accelerated skin aging and frailty when fed a high fat diet. Granzyme B (GrB) is a pro-apoptotic serine protease that has recently been shown to exhibit extracellular proteolytic activity in certain pathologies. In the present study, the role of GrB in skin aging and pathology was assessed using the apoE-KO model of skin aging. Male C57BL/6 wild type and apoE-KO mice were grown for 0, 5, 15 or 30\u00a0weeks on either a high fat (21.2% fat, 0.2% cholesterol) or regular chow diet (7% fat). ApoE/GrB double knockout (DKO) mice were also generated and assessed after being fed either diet for 30\u00a0weeks. Skin was removed from the mid to lower back and examined for age-related changes such as hair loss, skin thinning and collagen remodeling and disorganization. ApoE-KO mice exhibited signs of frailty, hair graying, hair loss, skin thinning, loss of collagen density and increased skin pathologies featuring collagen remodeling and reduced decorin compared to wild type controls. These phenotypes occurred earlier and were more severe when fed a high fat diet. In addition, we also observed increased GrB expression in proximity to areas of decorin degradation and reduced collagen density in the skin of apoE-KO mice. DKO mice exhibited protection against skin thinning, ECM degradation and loss of dermal collagen density. In summary, our results provide novel insights into the effects of a high fat diet and apoE deficiency on skin aging and pathology and suggest a role for GrB in age-related skin thinning and frailty.",

Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) exhibit limited proliferative potential in vitro, the so-called Hayflick limit. According to the free-radical theory, reactive oxygen species (ROS) might be the candidates responsible for senescence and age-related diseases. H2O2 may be responsible for the production of high levels of ROS, in which the redox balance is disturbed and the cells shift into a state of oxidative stress, which subsequently leads to premature senescence with shortening telomeres. H2O2 has been the most commonly used inducer of SIPS, which shares features of replicative senescence (RS) including a similar morphology, senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity, cell cycle regulation, etc. Therefore, in this study, the senescence of hMSC during SIPS was confirmed using a range of different analytical methods.

Also, proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) was used to elucidate the difference between metabolites in the control and hMSCs treated with H2O2.

Age-related declines in function undermine many aspects of normal youthful physiology including behavior. Age-related behavioral declines are quite telling because they presumably reflect primary functional defects in the nervous system or musculature. Consequently, a more detailed understanding of behavioral declines that occur with age, including mechanisms that impinge on them, could ultimately lead to improved treatment or diagnosis of age-related defects in physiological processes that depend on normal function of the nervous system or musculature. Such advances in diagnosis or treatment would translate into tremendous gains in quality of life for elderly populations.

In addition, a subset of Hsps is induced by oxidative stress through the JNK signaling pathway and the transcription factor Foxo. The Hsps counteract the toxicity of abnormal proteins by facilitating protein refolding and turnover, and through other mechanisms including inhibition of apoptosis. The Hsps are up-regulated in tissue-specific patterns during aging, and their expression correlates with, and sometimes predicts, life span, making them ideal biomarkers of aging.

     "abstract": "It has been almost two decades since dietary restriction was first shown to increase Drosophila lifespan. Since then, understanding this phenomenon advanced as groups worked to identify what quality of restricted diet matters: calories or a specific nutrient. The problem is complex because is it difficult to measure what a fly actually consumes. A powerful solution uses the geometric framework of nutrition where diets in many combinations can be tested for their effects on lifespan and reproduction while measuring intake. Applied to Drosophila, it is now clear that specific nutrients, not calories, mediate longevity. The geometric framework also reveals a nutritional basis for the trade-off between reproduction and lifespan. This complements a stable-isotope analysis that tracked the allocation of nitrogen, carbon and essential amino acids into eggs versus reproduction. Together, these studies show that it is not possible to explain how DR extends lifespan through a mechanism were resources are simply reallocated to somatic maintenance away from reproduction. Although promising in principle, genetic analysis of DR mechanisms has had limited success. To be productive, studies must include enough diets at appropriate concentrations. In reviewing the best data, there is little evidence to date for any gene to be required for DR to increase Drosophila lifespan, including insulin signaling or 4eBP. Strong analyses of genes required for DR should be a priority in future research with Drosophila and this may be made most robust by considering the effect of mutants in the context of the geometric framework.",

Here I review what evolutionary and molecular biologists have learned about such \"costs of reproduction\" in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) since Maynard Smith's (1958) seminal discovery that sterile mutants in D. subobscura live substantially longer than fertile wildtype flies. Together with observations from the nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and other organisms, the data from Drosophila suggest that there are at least four general principles that underlie trade-offs between reproduction and lifespan: (1) trade-offs between survival and reproduction are widespread; (2) the relationship between increased lifespan and decreased fecundity can be uncoupled under certain conditions; (3) while survival costs of reproduction might not necessarily be due to competitive resource allocation, we lack robust alternative explanations for their occurrence; and (4) physiological trade-offs between reproduction and longevity do not always translate into evolutionary genetic trade-offs. I conclude that \u2013 despite much recent progress \u2013 our current understanding of the proximate basis of survival costs of reproduction remains very limited; much future work on the genetics and physiology of such trade-offs will be required to uncover their mechanistic basis.",

     "abstract": "A remarkable discovery of recent years is that, despite the complexity of ageing, simple genetic interventions can increase lifespan and improve health during ageing in laboratory animals. The pathways involved have often proved to sense nutrients and to match costly activities of organisms, such as growth, metabolism and reproduction, to nutrient status. For instance, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor and Target of Rapamycin signalling network has proved to play a function in ageing, from yeast to mammals, seemingly including humans. In the fruit fly Drosophila, altered activity of several components of this network can increase lifespan and improve locomotor and cardiac function during ageing. The fly brain, fat body (equivalent of mammalian liver and white adipose tissue) and the germ line are important in determination of lifespan, with considerable communication between different tissues. Cellular detoxification pathways, increased autophagy and altered protein synthesis have all been implicated in increased lifespan from reduced IIS/TOR activity, with the role of defence against oxidative stress unresolved. Reduced IIS/TOR signalling can alter or block the response of lifespan to dietary restriction. Reduced IIS can act acutely to lower death rate, implying that it may ameliorate the effects of ageing-related damage, rather than preventing it.",

     "abstract": "Extensive studies in model organisms in the last few decades have revealed that aging is subject to profound genetic influence. The conserved nutrient sensing TOR (Target of Rapamycin) pathway is emerging as a key regulator of lifespan and healthspan in various species from yeast to mammals. The TOR signaling pathway plays a critical role in determining how a eukaryotic cell or a cellular system co-ordinates its growth, development and aging in response to constant changes in its surrounding environment? TOR integrates signals originating from changes in growth factors, nutrient availability, energy status and various physiological stresses. Each of these inputs is specialized to sense particular signal(s), and conveys it to the TOR complex which in turn relays the signal to downstream outputs to appropriately respond to the environmental changes. These outputs include mRNA translation, autophagy, transcription, metabolism, cell survival, proliferation and growth amongst a number of other cellular processes, some of which influence organismal lifespan. Here we review the contribution of the model organism Drosophila in the understanding of TOR signaling and the various biological processes it modulates that may impact on aging. Drosophila was the first organism where the nutrient dependent effects of the TOR pathway on lifespan were first uncovered. We also discuss how the nutrient-sensing TOR pathway appears to be critically important for mediating the longevity effects of dietary restriction (DR), a potent environmental method of lifespan extension by nutrient limitation. Identifying the molecular mechanisms that modulate lifespan downstream of TOR is being intensely investigated and there is hope that these are likely to serve as potential targets for amelioration of age-related diseases and enhance healthful lifespan extension in humans.",

Over a course of days to weeks, these early glycation products undergo further reactions and rearrangements to become irreversibly crossed-linked, fluorescent protein derivatives termed advanced glycation end products (AGEs).

A cascade of subsequent downstream events may lead to disturbed metabolic changes, and neuroinflammation and tau pathology. The role of NGF on the cell death of cholinergic neurons is discussed. Additional risk factors (e.g. acidosis, metals) contribute to plaque development.",

     "abstract": "Trophocytes and fat cells are distributed around the abdominal segments in honeybees (Apis mellifera). Whether these cells are a good model for cellular senescence studies is unknown. Here we used histochemical, biochemical, and genetic techniques to investigate the fluctuation of age-related molecules in trophocytes and fat cells of newly emerged and old worker bees. Histochemical studies revealed that old worker trophocytes and fat cells exhibited more senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase, lipofuscin granules, and non-homogeneous cellular morphology compared to the same cells in newly emerged workers. Biochemical assays demonstrated that trophocytes and fat cells of old workers expressed more lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation than those of newly emerged workers. Molecular genetic analyses detected no difference in telomerase activity or telomere length in trophocytes and fat cells between newly emerged and old workers, showing that these cells do not divide in adulthood. These results suggest that the expression of age-related molecules in trophocytes and fat cells is associated with the senescence of the cells and that honeybee trophocytes and fat cells can serve as a mode for cellular senescence.",

We performed a comprehensive study to examine oxidative stress in the brains of male rats with (experienced) or without (na\u00efve) reproductive activity during aging. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, aconitase, and aconitase reactivated, and by measuring lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, nitrite and nitrate levels, vitamin C levels, and glutathione (total, reduced, oxidized forms) levels in brain tissue, as well as testosterone and estradiol levels in serum. Reproductively active animals exhibited increased testosterone levels and aconitase activity, suggesting an increased metabolism. Increased antioxidant enzyme activities and increased levels of antioxidant compounds were observed, yet damage to biomolecules was also observed in experienced rats. During aging changes in oxidative stress were observed. We found higher activities of antioxidant enzymes, higher amounts of antioxidants, and more damage at six months of age among experienced animals than among na\u00efve animals. Similar antioxidant activities and levels, and damage were found between the groups at twenty-four months of age. These results add comprehensive data regarding changes in oxidative stress during aging, and suggest an explanation for the costs of reproduction.",

Post-mortem analysis revealed lesions in liver (~\u00a090%), kidney (~\u00a075%), heart (~\u00a070%) and gonads (~\u00a040%) which are similar to those previously described in the small teleost Poecilia reticulata. In addition, a high incidence of neoplasias was observed in liver (~\u00a035%) and kidney (~\u00a025%).Different laboratory strains of N. furzeri show large genetic differences in longevity. Cross-sectional analysis revealed a clear age-dependent increase in the incidence of liver neoplasias which was accelerated in a short-lived strain. Cross-sectional analysis of gonads revealed sex-specific differences in the occurrence of lesions, with males being more severely affected than females.In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that short life span in N. furzeri is a consequence of a typical teleost aging process which determines systemic failure of homeostasis functions rather than of a single organ or apparatus. Unlike other teleosts, however, this scenario is reinforced by high incidence of age-dependent neoplasias, making this species a promising model to analyze the molecular pathways of age-dependent spontaneous tumorigenesis.",

In this study, young (6\u00a0mo) and old (24\u201328\u00a0mo) mice were subjected to 2\u00a0h of TK-induced ischemia of the hindlimb followed by 1, 3, 5, or 7\u00a0days of reperfusion.

At the basis of these effects lie molecular mechanisms which include nitric oxide metabolic pathway, whose involvement in the occurrence of morphological modifications related to such neurodegenerative process is suggested. Current evidences show that the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen posses a protective effect against the development of the disease, substantially delaying its onset; furthermore (R)-\u03b1-lipoic acid seems to have an antioxidant ameliorating effect on disease progression. Starting from these data, a new lipophilic codrug 1, obtained by joining an antioxidant molecule with an NSAID, has been previously synthesized. Our aim has been to investigate the possible therapeutical effects of codrug 1, compared to ibuprofen, on the molecular events at the basis of behavioural and morphological modifications occurring in A\u03b2 (1-40) infused rat brains.Ibuprofen and codrug 1 seem to protect the subject against memory performance impairment and against behavioural detriment, induced by administration of A\u03b2 (1-40) peptide. Such evidences are supported by morphological and biochemical findings showing A\u03b2 (1-40) to determine cell disorganization, increased number of \u03b2-amyloid plaques and capillary vessels dilatation in parallel to increased total and specific NOS activity and to apoptosis occurrence, partly prevented by ibuprofen, more broadly by codrug 1.

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia coincides with declines in several systemic processes that signal through the MAP kinase and Akt-mTOR-p70S6k cascades typically associated with muscle growth. Effects of aging on these pathways have primarily been examined in limb muscles, which experience substantial activity and neural changes in addition to systemic hormonal and metabolic changes. Head and neck muscles are reported to undergo reduced sarcopenia and disuse with age relative to limb muscles, suggesting muscle activity may contribute to maintaining mass with age. However many head and neck muscles derive from embryonic branchial arches, rather than the somites from which limb muscles originate, suggesting that developmental origin may be important. This study compares the expression and phosphorylation of MAP kinase and mTOR networks in head, neck, tongue, and limb muscles from 8- and 26-month old F344 rats to test the hypothesis that physical activity and developmental origin contribute to preservation of muscle mass with age. Phosphorylation of p38 was exaggerated in aged branchial arch muscles. Phosphorylation of ERK and p70S6k T421/S424 declined with age only in the biceps brachii. Expression of p70S6k declined in all head and neck, tongue and limb muscles although no change in phosphorylation of p70S6k on T389 could be resolved. A systemic change that results in a loss of p70S6k protein expression may reduce the capacity to respond to acute hypertrophic stimuli, while the exaggerated p38 signaling in branchial arch muscles may reflect more active muscle remodeling.",

The association between R577X and loss in muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) has previously been investigated in a number of studies in elderly humans. The majority of studies report loss of ACTN3 genotype association with muscle traits in the elderly, however, there is some indication that the XX genotype may be associated with faster muscle function decline. To further explore these potential age-related effects and the underlying mechanisms, we examined the effect of \u03b1-actinin-3 deficiency in aging male and female Actn3 knockout (KO) mice (2, 6, 12, and 18\u00a0months). Our findings support previous reports of a diminished influence of ACTN3 genotype on muscle performance in the elderly: genotype differences in intrinsic exercise performance, fast muscle force generation and male muscle mass were lost in aged mice, but were maintained for other muscle function traits such as grip strength. The loss of genotype difference in exercise performance occurred despite the maintenance of some \u201cslower\u201d muscle characteristics in KO muscles, such as increased oxidative metabolism and greater force recovery after fatigue. Interestingly, muscle mass decline in aged 18\u00a0month old male KO mice was greater compared to wild-type controls (WT) (\u2212\u00a012.2% in KO; \u2212\u00a06.5% in WT).

Basal production and transient increases during stress of glucocorticoids and its hypothalamic regulators are essential for neuronal plasticity and normal brain function. While activation of the HPA axis is essential for survival during stress, chronic exposure to stress hormones can predispose to psychological, metabolic and immune alterations. Thus, prompt termination of the stress response is essential to prevent negative effects of inappropriate levels of CRH and glucocorticoids. This review addresses the regulation of HPA axis activity with emphasis on the mechanisms of termination of CRH transcription, which is a critical step in this process.

These growth factors are widely viewed as detrimental for long life by reducing tissue resistance to oxidative stress. However, IGF-I has been consistently shown to be a potent neuroprotective factor in mammals, and as such, a deterrent of brain aging. Conversely, recent data suggest that IGF-I may contribute to amyloid neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease. These opposing observations underline an incomplete understanding of the significance of this ancestral hormone pathway in relation to brain aging. It is possible that these opposite results are the consequence of using different experimental approaches. Thus, brain amyloid injury is reduced in mutant mice partially defective in IGF-I receptor function, whereas IGF-I is neuroprotective when administered to animal models of neurodegenerative disease or normal brain aging. This approach-dependent effect of IGF-I highlights a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the relationship between peripheral and brain IGF-I function and the actual biological impact of experimental modulation of brain IGF-I function.

Since reproduction is the most important function of an organism from the perspective of the survival of the species, if reproductive-cell cycle signaling factors determine the rate of growth, determine the rate of development, determine the rate of reproduction, and determine the rate of senescence, then by definition they determine the rate of aging and thus lifespan. The theory is able to explain: 1) the simultaneous regulation of the rate of aging and reproduction as evidenced by the fact that environmental conditions and experimental interventions known to extend longevity are associated with decreased reproductive-cell cycle signaling factors, thereby slowing aging and preserving fertility in a hostile reproductive environment; 2) two phenomena that are closely related to species lifespan\u2014the rate of growth and development and the ultimate size of the animal; 3). the apparent paradox that size is directly proportional to lifespan and inversely proportional to fertility between species but vice versa within a species; 4). how differing rates of reproduction between species is associated with differences in their lifespan; 5). why we develop aging-related diseases; and 6). an evolutionarily credible reason for why and how aging occurs\u2014these hormones act in an antagonistic pleiotrophic manner via cell cycle signaling; promoting growth and development early in life in order to achieve reproduction, but later in life, in a futile attempt to maintain reproduction, become dysregulated and drive senescence (dyosis).

     "abstract": "The brain is a major target of circulating insulin. Enhancing central nervous insulin action has been shown to improve memory functions in animals as well as in humans, benefitting in particular hippocampus-dependent (declarative) memory. As Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with reduced central nervous insulin signaling and attenuated permeation of blood-borne insulin across the blood-brain-barrier, the cognitive decline in AD patients may at least in part be derived from impaired brain insulin signaling. Thus, therapeutic strategies to overcome central nervous system insulin deficiency and resistance might be an attractive option in the treatment of cognitive impairments like AD. Insulin can be effectively delivered directly to the brain via the intranasal route that enables the hormone to bypass the blood-brain barrier and modulate central nervous functions. This review summarizes a series of studies demonstrating beneficial effects of intranasal insulin on memory functions both in healthy humans and in patients with cognitive impairments such as AD. These experiments in humans consistently indicate that enhancing brain insulin signaling by intranasal administration of the hormone improves hippocampus-dependent memory in the absence of adverse side effects. Considering that insulin also acts as a neuroprotective signal, up-regulating brain insulin levels by intranasal insulin administration appears to be a promising approach in the treatment and prevention of central nervous system insulin deficiency and resistance as found in AD.",

     "abstract": "More than 400 genes have been noted to modulate Caenorhabditis elegans longevity. Recent studies testing the role of proposed secreted insulin-binding proteins unexpectedly revealed a potent role for the EGF signaling pathway in promoting healthy aging and longevity in C. elegans. Activation of EGF receptor LET-23 is associated with increased mean and maximum lifespan, maintained pharyngeal pumping, extended locomotory function, and low lipofuscin and advanced glycation end product accumulation. Conversely, reducing the activity of the EGF pathway is associated with system-wide evidence of progeria. The EGF pathway appears to work in a manner largely independent of the insulin/IGF-like pathway, in that effects are additive with reduction of DAF-2/InsR activity and are not affected by DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor deficiency. Two novel regulators of EGF signaling, called HPA-1 and HPA-2 (for the h igh p erformance in a dvanced a ge locomotory phenotypes that their disruption confers), negatively regulate EGF action, possibly by binding and sequestering EGF. Interestingly, whereas HPA-1 appears to control aging of the animal overall, HPA-2 exerts an effect primarily on locomotory aging. As such, HPA-2 is an example of a protein with an effect on healthspan but not lifespan, a gene class that may have been missed in screens focused on longevity endpoint. To date, roles for EGF signaling in adult maintenance (particularly in non-dividing tissues) have not been addressed in other organisms\u2014should EGF signaling exert a conserved impact on healthy aging, testing this hypothesis could hold implications for anti-aging therapies.",

     "abstract": "Aging of the immune system is a major factor responsible for the increased severity of infections, reduced responses to vaccines, and higher cancer incidence in the elderly. A major category of stressors that contribute to the alterations within the T lymphocyte compartment is the family of herpes viruses. These viruses, usually acquired early in life, persist for many decades and drive certain T cells to the end stage of replicative senescence, which is characterized by a variety of phenotypic and functional changes, including altered cytokine profile, resistance to apoptosis, and shortened telomeres. Indeed, high proportions of senescent CD8 (cytotoxic) T lymphocytess are associated with latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in the elderly, and are part of a cluster of immune biomarkers that are associated with early mortality. Similar cells accumulate at younger ages in persons chronically infected with HIV-1. In addition to persistent viral infection, psychological stress as well as oxidative stress can also contribute to the generation of senescent dysfunctional T lymphocytes. Strategies such as cell culture manipulation of replicative senescence, as well as lifestyle and stress reduction techniques are discussed in terms of possible approaches to enhance immune function in older persons. This review highlights the importance of using humans in studies on immunosenescence and telomere/telomerase dynamics, since model organisms employed in other facets of aging research are not subject to the particular factors that cause the striking age-related reconfiguration of the human immune system.",

Here we review how steroid hormones, a particular group of lipophilic hormones, affect life history traits in the nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), with a particular focus on longevity.

     "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) remains the most robust environmental intervention for altering aging processes and increasing healthspan and lifespan. Emerging from progress made in many nonhuman models, current research has expanded to formal, controlled human studies of CR. Since long-term CR requires a major commitment of will power and long-term negative consequences remain to be determined, the concept of a calorie restriction mimetic (CRM) has become a new area of investigation within gerontology. We have proposed that a CRM is a compound that mimics metabolic, hormonal, and physiological effects of CR, activates stress response pathways observed in CR and enhances stress protection, produces CR-like effects on longevity, reduces age-related disease, and maintains more youthful function, all without significantly reducing food intake. Over 12\u00a0years ago, we introduced the concept of glycolytic inhibition as a strategy for developing mimetics of CR. We have argued that inhibiting energy utilization as far upstream as possible might offer a broader range of CR-like effects as opposed to targeting a singular molecular target downstream. As the first candidate CRM, 2-deoxyglucose, a known anti-glycolytic, provided a remarkable phenotype of CR, but turned out to produce cardiotoxicity in rats. Since the introduction of 2DG as a candidate CRM, many different targets for development have now been proposed at more downstream sites, including insulin receptor sensitizers, sirtuin activators, and inhibitors of mTOR. This review discusses these various strategies to assess their current status and future potential for this emerging research field.",

     "abstract": "The identification of longevity-related structural adaptations in biological macromolecules may yield relevant insights into the molecular mechanisms of aging. In screening fully sequenced animal proteomes for signals associated with longevity, it was found that cysteine depletion in respiratory chain complexes was the by far strongest predictor on the amino acid usage level to co-vary with lifespan. This association was though restricted to aerobic animals, whereas anaerobic animals showed variable cysteine accumulation. By contrast, methionine accumulation, a prominent feature of mitochondrially encoded proteins affording competitive antioxidant protection, was not predictive of longevity, but rather paralleled aerobic metabolic capacity. Hence, the easily oxidized sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine (a thiol) and methionine (a thioether) show doubly diametrical behaviour in two central paradigms of respiratory oxidative stress. From this comparison, it is concluded that only the one\u2013electron oxidation of thiols to thiyl radicals contributes to aging, whereas other forms of sulfur oxidation, especially even-electron oxidation of both thiols and thioethers, are less critically involved, presumably as their consequences may be much more easily repaired. Thiyl radicals may yet act as chain-transfer agents to entail an irreversible intramembrane cross-linking (\u201cplastination\u201d) of some of the a priori most hydrophobic and insoluble proteins known, the respiratory chain complexes.",

Stress accelerates, whereas positive lifestyle factors such as physical and mental exercise, slow the progression of AD symptoms and neuropathological hallmarks in humans and genetic mouse models of the condition. Positive lifestyle factors are thought to improve brain function and delay ageing through the induction of a mild stress response as opposed to excessive stress reactions causing the harmful effects of adverse stressors. This suggests that stress mediators can be targeted for the development of improved treatment for AD. This review discussed the involvement of glucocorticoids, corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and cholinergic stress reactions, through the induction of a protective splice variant of synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R), in the progression of AD symptoms and neuropathological hallmarks and the impact of lifestyle factors. It is concluded that CRH is likely to play a critical, dose-dependent role in AD progression, protective at low doses but harmful at high doses, whereas an excess of glucocorticoids may only exacerbate some aspects of the disease. AChE-R shows a promising therapeutic potential which needs to be further investigated.",

Thus, the signaling mechanisms within mitochondria and between the organelle and its environment have gained interest as potential drug targets. Emerging mitochondrial signaling systems with potential for exploiting them for therapeutic intervention include, among others, the NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases of the Sirtuin family, the redox enzyme p66Shc, and enzymes of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways.

     "abstract": "Our hypothesis is that there is \u2018wear and tear\u2019 in the brain, which is the basis of the process of aging, but that stimulation of brain function may slow down brain aging and diminish the risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), possibly by activating repair mechanisms. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is presented in this review.During normal aging and in AD, cell loss is not as prominent a phenomenon as is often presumed. In fact, unaltered neuronal numbers have been reported in many brain areas in AD, e.g. in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) where the number of large neurons decreases while that of small neurons increases. Decreased neuronal activity is an essential characteristic of AD, and a substantial decrease of cerebral glucose metabolism may even precede cognitive impairments.Some hypothalamic neurons remain intact and active during the process of aging, others become even hyperactive, which may lead to disorders. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels were found to be higher in the elderly than in young subjects. There is an age-related, sex-dependent activation of the AVP neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which may be the basis of analogous changes in the prevalence of hypertension and hyponatraemia in the elderly. No significant functional loss of magnocellular hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons were found in the SON or PVN in AD.The activity of the corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the hypothalamic PVN is the basis for the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is activated during aging in a sex-dependent way, and even more activated in AD. The activated HPA axis is a risk for depression.Environmental stimulation increases brain reserve. An increase in time spent on intellectual activities was associated with a significant decrease in probability to get AD, and occupation has even a stronger indication of diminished risk for dementia.A series of observations showed that a dysfunctional clock may underlie the disordered rhythms in AD. Additional bright light improved the rest\u2013activity rhythms, while giving bright light and/or melatonin to AD patients ameliorated the progression of cognitive and noncognitive symptoms. This implies that neurons affected by AD can still be reactivated if the right stimuli are applied. Unknown diffusible factors from the neural stem cells improve the survival of aged and degenerating neurons in postmortem human brain slice cultures. Gene therapy with nerve growth factor aimed at the NBM showed metabolic activation of various brain regions. A microarray study of the prefrontal cortex in the course of AD revealed an increased expression of genes related to synaptic activity and changes in plasticity during the very early pre-symptomatic stages, which is proposed to represent a coping mechanism against increased soluble \u03b2-amyloid levels.In brief, these examples of the \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 principle during the course of aging or AD now provide novel targets for the development of therapeutic strategies aiming at the prevention and treatment of AD.",

Notably, vascular aging and cardiovascular disease are both associated with endothelial dysfunction, or a marked decrease in production and bioavailability the vasodilator of nitric oxide (NO). As a result of decreased nitric oxide availability, aging vessels often exhibit endothelial cell senescence and increased oxidative stress. One of the most potent activators of NO production is fluid shear stress produced by blood flow. Interestingly, age-related decrease in NO production partially results from endothelial insensitivity to shear stress. While the endothelial cell response to fluid shear stress has been well characterized in recent years, the exact mechanisms of how the mechanical force of fluid shear stress is converted into intracellular biochemical signals are relatively unknown. Therefore, gaining a better knowledge of mechanosignaling events in endothelial cells may prove to be beneficial for developing potential therapies for cardiovascular diseases.",

     "abstract": "Age-related loss of muscle mass and function greatly affects quality of life in the elderly population. Several hypotheses have been proposed but accumulating evidence point to alterations in neuromuscular system during aging as a key event that leads to functional denervation, muscle wasting, and weakness. Over the past few decades, age-associated degeneration of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and its components have been well documented. With advancing age, pre-terminal portions of motor axons exhibit regions of abnormal thinning, distension, and sprouting whereas postsynaptic endplates decrease in size and reduce in number, length, and density of postsynaptic folds. Although the exact underlying mechanisms are still lacking, recent studies provided direct evidence that age-associated increase in oxidative stress plays a crucial role in NMJ degeneration and progression of sarcopenia. Homozygous deletion of an important antioxidant enzyme, Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD, SOD1) leads to acceleration of age-dependent muscle atrophy, with a significant NMJ degeneration similar to that seen in old wild-type sarcopenic animals. In this short review, we briefly summarize the current understanding of some of the cellular and molecular changes in the NMJ during aging and suggest a role for oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related changes in the maintenance of neuromuscular innervation.",

The studies were originally designed to explore the potential of this agent for reducing the rate of onset of some genetic indices of brain aging. When these animals were sacrificed they were routinely examined for overt evidence of tumors and when these were found, a note was made of their occurrence, and of their size. Tumors are commonly found during senescence of several strains of mice. Since tumorigenesis was not the original intent of the study, these observations were recorded but not pursued in greater detail. In this report, these data have now been collated and summarized. This analysis has the disadvantage that tumor origin and morphology were not recorded. However, the study also has the advantage of being conducted over an extended period of time with many groups of animals. In consequence, many extraneous factors, which could be potential confounders, such as seasonal or dietary variations, are unlikely to have interfered with the analysis. The use of more than one mouse strain strengthens the possibility that the findings may have general relevance.

SAD cybrids had increased apoptosis and increased accumulation of ROS that was inhibited by puerarin.

At present there are no reliable diagnostic biomarkers of AD in the blood. Therefore, specific products of lipid peroxidation in the blood of AD patients were investigated. Lipophilic extracts of erythrocytes in the group of patients with AD (n\u00a0=\u00a044) and age-matched controls (n\u00a0=\u00a016) were studied. The end-products of lipid peroxidation, so called lipofuscin-like pigments (LFP), were analysed by fluorescence spectroscopy. It was found that the level of these products is significantly increased in erythrocytes of AD patients compared to controls. LFP were further separated by means of HPLC into individual fractions to study their composition in AD and controls. The specific fraction of LFP in AD patients, which was isolated, might represent a disease-specific product in the blood.",

     "abstract": "Clinical evidence indicates that fat is inversely proportional to bone mass in elderly obese women. However, it remains unclear whether obesity accelerates bone loss. In this report we present evidence that increased visceral fat leads to inflammation and subsequent bone loss in 12-month-old C57BL/6J mice that were fed 10% corn oil (CO)-based diet and a control lab chow (LC) for 6\u00a0months. As expected from our previous work, CO-fed mice demonstrated increased visceral fat and enhanced total body fat mass compared to LC. The adipocyte-specific PPAR\u03b3 and bone marrow (BM) adiposity were increased in CO-fed mice. In correlation with those modifications, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) were significantly elevated in CO-fed mice compared to LC-fed mice. This inflammatory BM microenvironment resulted in increased superoxide production in osteoclasts and undifferentiated BM cells. In CO-fed mice, the increased number of osteoclasts per trabecular bone length and the increased osteoclastogenesis assessed ex-vivo suggest that CO diet induces bone resorption. Additionally, the up-regulation of osteoclast-specific cathepsin k and RANKL expression and down-regulation of osteoblast-specific RUNX2/Cbfa1 supports this bone resorption in CO-fed mice. Also, CO-fed mice exhibited lower trabecular bone volume in the distal femoral metaphysis and had reduced OPG expression. Collectively, our results suggest that increased bone resorption in mice fed a CO-enriched diet is possibly due to increased inflammation mediated by the accumulation of adipocytes in the BM microenvironment. This inflammation may consequently increase osteoclastogenesis, while reducing osteoblast development in CO-fed mice.",

It is unknown if stress facilitates or impairs learning in an aged animal. In this study, the effect of mild stress on learning and task retention (1\u00a0week later) was assessed in young and aged mice. In addition, because exercise can counteract negative effects of stress and facilitate learning, the effect of 1 week of voluntary exercise on task retention was assessed. Regulation of the learning/memory related genes BDNF exon VI, synapsin, MAPK, and CRFR1 were also examined in the hippocampus using real-time PCR. Results of this study demonstrate that mild stress 24\u00a0h prior to the learning test improved performance in aged, but not young animals. However, exercise for 1 week between tests improved the performance of both groups of animals in the retention task. In aged, but not young animals, all four genes increased significantly after exercise. Thus, in aged animals mild stress facilitates learning and the retention of this task is improved by voluntary exercise.",

     "abstract": "Laminins are large heterotrimeric glycoproteins found in basement membranes where they play an essential role in cell-matrix adhesion, migration, growth, and differentiation of various cell types. Previous work reported that a genetic variant located within the intron 1 of LAMA5 (rs659822) was associated with anthropometric traits and HDL-cholesterol levels in a cohort of premenopausal women. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of LAMA5 rs659822 on anthropometric traits, lipid profile, and fasting glucose levels in an Italian cohort of 667 healthy elderly subjects (aged 64\u2013107\u00a0years). We also tested for association between these traits and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs13043313, which was previously shown to control variation in LAMA5 transcript abundance in the liver of Caucasians. In age- and gender-adjusted linear regression analyses, we did not find association of rs13043313 with any of the traits. However, under an additive model, the minor C-allele of LAMA5 rs659822 was associated with shorter stature (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and higher fasting glucose levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Moreover, subjects homozygous for the C-allele showed on average 6% and 10% lower total cholesterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) and LDL-cholesterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) levels, respectively, than those carrying at least one T allele, assuming a recessive model. Finally, in analyses stratified by age groups (age range 64\u201389 and 90\u2013107\u00a0years), we found that the C-allele was additively associated with increased body weight (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) in the age group 64\u201389\u00a0years, whereas no association was found in the age group 90\u2013107\u00a0years. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that LAMA5 rs659822 regulates anthropometric and metabolic traits in elderly people. Future studies are warranted to replicate these findings in independent and larger populations and to investigate whether rs659822 is the causal variant responsible for the observed associations.",

Here, we use a preclinical model (male Brown Norway X F344 rats aged 12, 18, 24, and 30\u00a0months) to describe the outcome of chronic fentanyl administration (1.0\u00a0mg/kg/day) on various physiological and behavioral measures. Continuous fentanyl administration resulted in an initial decrease in food consumption, followed by the development of tolerance to this effect over a 4-week period and a subsequent increase in food consumption during withdrawal. This change in food consumption was associated with decreases in body weight (predominantly due to a loss of fat mass) that was maintained through early withdrawal. After 1 month of withdrawal, only the 12-month old animals had fully regained body weight. Fentanyl administration resulted in a decrease in grip strength and an increase in locomotor activity that did not differ across age groups. There was no effect of fentanyl administration on rotarod performance. These results demonstrate that while there is a delayed recovery of body mass with age, the observed changes in behavioral responses are uniform across ages.",

Meal-induced insulin sensitization (MIS) occurs as a result of insulin-mediated release of hepatic insulin sensitizing substance (HISS) that increases glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. HISS release decreases with age, and exercise causes metabolic improvements in aging, therefore it is important to analyze the effect of exercise on age-associated decline in HISS-action.The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that improved insulin sensitivity, by voluntary running-wheel exercise in aging rats, is attained by preserving the HISS response. We also investigate the possible association of exercise-mediated beneficial changes in metabolic conditions and body composition with improved HISS-action.We measured insulin- and HISS-sensitivity in 9, 14 and 21-week old rats with/without exercise. Metabolic markers were also determined in age-matched control and exercised rats.Exercise significantly improved HISS-dependent glucose uptake in all age groups. The direct action of insulin was minimally altered by age or exercise. Body composition and metabolic conditions were beneficially changed with exercise-induced improvements in the HISS response.The therapeutic efficacy of voluntary exercise against insulin resistance in aging rats is achieved mainly through restoration of HISS-action.",

The purpose of this study was to measure daily muscle activity and quiescence in non-frail, pre-frail, and frail older women using portable electromyography (EMG). Thirty-three community-dwelling older Greek women were categorized as non-frail (n\u00a0=\u00a010, 74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years), pre-frail (n\u00a0=\u00a011, 75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years), and frail (n\u00a0=\u00a012, 81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0years) based upon the frailty phenotype. Surface EMG over a 9-hour typical day was recorded from the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, vastus lateralis, and biceps femoris of the dominant side. Burst and gap analysis was used to quantify muscle activity and quiescence. The total duration of the muscles that were active (~\u00a02.5\u00a0h) and quiescent (~\u00a04\u00a0h) did not differ across frailty groups. However, the number of bursts was 28% fewer and the mean burst duration was 26% longer in frail women compared with the non-frail women. In addition, muscle activity was greater in the arm muscles than the thigh muscles across all groups (e.g. ~\u00a060% greater burst percentage). Burst number and duration indicate that muscle activity differs across stages of frailty in older women and is greater in the upper compared with lower limbs.",

     "abstract": "Alpha1-adrenoceptors (\u03b11-ARs) are involved in neuro-thymic and thymic intercellular communications, and consequently modulation of T-cell development. Ageing is associated with a number of changes in noradrenergic neuro-effector transmission, and possibly intercellular noradrenaline (NA)-mediated communication resulting in altered responses of target cells to NA. Thus, in old animals an altered NA modulation of thymopoiesis via \u03b11-ARs may be expected. To test this hypothesis, in old and young adult Wistar rats we examined: 1) thymic NA levels, density of noradrenergic innervation and NA synthesizing cells, as well as \u03b11-AR expression, and 2) then the effects of 14-day-long treatment with the \u03b11-AR blocker, urapidil, on thymocyte development. Overall, the first part of study suggested augmented NA signalling to thymic cells via \u03b11-ARs due to increased NA availability and \u03b11-AR thymocyte surface density in old rats. The second part of study supported this assumption. Namely, although in rats of both ages urapidil affected the same thymocyte developmental steps ultimately leading to changes in the relative number of the most mature single positive TCR\u03b1\u03b2high thymocytes, its effects were generally more prominent in old animals. Following urapidil treatment, the percentages of CD4\u00a0+\u00a0CD8\u2212 cells, including those showing a regulatory CD4\u00a0+\u00a0CD25\u00a0+\u00a0RT6.1\u2212 phenotype, were increased, while CD4\u00a0\u2212\u00a0CD8+ cells decreased. In old rats, an augmented thymic escape of immature CD4\u00a0+\u00a0CD8+ cells was also registered. In rats of both ages the thymic changes were accompanied by alterations in the proportions of major cell populations in the T-lymphocyte compartment of both peripheral blood and spleen, leading to an increase in the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio. These alterations were also more pronounced in old rats. Moreover, in old rats following urapidil treatment the proportion of TCR\u03b1\u03b2\u00a0+\u00a0cells in the periphery was slightly greater reflecting, most likely, partly enhanced thymic production of regulatory CD161\u00a0+\u00a0TCR\u03b1\u03b2\u00a0+\u00a0cells. Thus, the study indirectly suggests an age-associated increase in the basal \u03b11-AR-mediated inhibitory influence of NA on thymopoiesis.",

We have evidence that long-living GH-deficient Ames dwarf mice have enhanced antioxidant protection in the periphery but the protection in the central nervous system is less clear.In the present study, we evaluated the antioxidative defense enzyme status in the hippocampus of Ames dwarf and wild type mice at 3, 12 and 24\u00a0months of age and examined the ability of each genotype to resist kainic acid-induced (KA) oxidative stress. An equiseizure concentration of KA was administered such that both genotypes responded with similar seizure scores and lipid peroxidation.We found that GH-sufficient wild type mice showed an increase in oxidative stress as indicated by the reduced ratio of glutathione: glutathione disulfide following KA injection while this ratio was maintained in GH-deficient Ames dwarf mice. In addition, glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx) as well as GPx1 mRNA expression was enhanced in KA-injected Ames dwarf mice but decreased in wild type mice. There was no induction of Nrf-2 (an oxidative stress-induced transcription factor) gene expression in Ames dwarf mice following KA further suggesting maintenance of antioxidant defense in GH-deficiency under oxidative stress conditions.Therefore, based on equiseizure administration of KA, Ames dwarf mice have an enhanced antioxidant defense capacity in the hippocampus similar to that observed in the periphery. This improved defense capability in the brain is likely due to increased GPx availability in Ames mice and may contribute to their enhanced longevity.",

Methods: we studied 21 female Wistar rats aged 12\u201314\u00a0months, divided into three groups: sham-operated control (SHAM), ovariectomized (OVX), and ovariectomized rats supplemented with extravirgin olive oil (Olive\u2013OVX) orally for 12\u00a0weeks; 4\u00a0weeks before ovariectomy and 8\u00a0weeks after. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected for lipid profile assays. Malondialdehyde (MDA) in soleus muscles was assayed. The diaphragms were collected for determination of glucose uptake by the muscles. Soleus muscles and pancreas were processed for histological examination. Results: ovariectomy impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by diaphragm of female rats, induced abnormalities of lipid metabolism, and increased the oxidative stress marker, MDA level in soleus muscles. Olive oil supplementation to ovariectomized rats resulted in an enhancement of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by diaphragm and a better lipid profile, as well as a decrease in the MDA level in soleus muscles. Histological study in OVX rats revealed a decrease in the size and number of islets of Langerhans in the pancreatic tissue, and decreases in both glycogen content, and in mitochondrial density in the soleus muscles. In Olive\u2013OVX rats the size of islets of Langerhans was normal, and muscle glycogen, and muscle mitochondrial density were increased as compared to OVX rats. Conclusion: ovariectomy impaired in vitro insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by diaphragm. The improvement of this impairment by olive oil supplementation could be attributed to its antioxidant properties, its high content of monounsaturated fatty acids, as well as, its enhancement effect on mitochondrial density in skeletal muscles.",

Experimentations were carried out utilizing Sprague\u2013Dawley rats at 6 and 24\u00a0months of age. The histological analysis showed a significant loss in thickness of the intestinal mucosa during aging, which was accompanied by higher reactive species. Molecular analysis revealed the mitochondrial translocation of Bax showed a significant increase with aging. However, the expression of cyclophilin D, adenine nucleotide translocator, and the voltage-dependent anion channel that regulates the mitochondria permeability transition pore decreased or remained unchanged. Furthermore, the expression of caspase 3 was enhanced in aged ileum with increased DNA fragmentation, while nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G were decreased with aging.In conclusion, our findings indicate that the mitochondrial translocation of Bax by increased oxidative stress may result in cell death through caspase-dependent apoptosis in aged ileum, thereby leading to a decrease in intestinal mucosal thickness during aging.",

Creatinine clearance, proteinuria, urinary excretion of Na+ and K+ and fractional excretion of Na+ were also determined.The results show that at 91\u00a0weeks old WKY rats had increased creatinine clearance and did not have proteinuria. Despite aging having had no effect on urinary Na+ excretion, urinary K+ excretion was increased and fractional Na+ excretion was decreased with age. In renal proximal tubules and isolated renal cortical cells, 91\u00a0week old rats had decreased Na+,K+-ATPase activity when compared to 13 and 52\u00a0week old rats. In renal medulla, 91\u00a0week old rats had increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity, paralleled by an increase in protein expression of \u03b11-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase. In addition, renal H2O2 production increased with age and at 91\u00a0weeks of age renal medulla H2O2 production was significantly higher than renal cortex production.The present work demonstrates that although at 91\u00a0weeks of age WKY rats were able to maintain Na+ homeostasis, aging was accompanied by alterations in renal Na+,K+-ATPase function.

To better understand what influences the lifespan of an adult fruit fly, we tested whether developmental temperature could affect stress responses used as surrogate markers for the aging process. When 2-day-old adult flies developed at two representative temperatures (18\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C) were challenged with three stresses (starvation, oxidation, and heat), both male and female flies developed at 18\u00a0\u00b0C exhibited stronger resistance to all three stresses compared to those developed at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Nutrient composition analyses showed that fat, protein, and glycogen levels increased when male flies were developed at 18\u00a0\u00b0C. These differences in stress resistance by developmental temperature were sustained even between 30-day-old male flies of two groups aged at the same temperature. We also showed that development at a lower temperature represented by 18\u00a0\u00b0C significantly downregulates anti-microbial peptide genes, AttA and DptB, of Imd pathway.",

     "abstract": "The accumulation of senescent cells within tissues can potentially lead to biological dysfunction and manifestation of disease associated with ageing. The majority of senescent cells display a commonly altered secretome similar to a wound healing response (termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype or SASP), which could have deleterious implications on the tissue microenvironment. However, senescent cells also appear to have a cell-type (or even cell-strain) exclusive senescent phenotype (CESP), an area of research that is underexplored. One such CESP is the pro-calcificatory phenotype recently reported in senescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Senescent VSMCs have been shown to overexpress genes and proteins (including RUNX-2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), type I collagen and BMP-2) associated with osteoblasts, leading to partial osteoblastic transdifferentiation. As such, it has been suggested that senescent VSMCs contribute to cardiovascular dysfunction through induction of vascular calcification. This review discusses recent findings on VSMC senescence and their potential role in the pathophysiology of vascular calcification.",

     "abstract": "The mammalian MRG15 gene encodes a chromodomain protein predicted to bind to chromatin via methylated histone tails. Human MORF4 encodes a related but truncated protein that is capable of promoting cellular senescence in a subset of human tumor cell lines. Drosophila contains a single homolog of human MRG15, called DmMRG15. Null mutation of MRG15 is embryonic-lethal in mice and Drosophila, making the study of MRG15 requirements in adults difficult. In these studies the DmMRG15 gene was over-expressed in Drosophila, during developmental stages and in adults, using a doxycycline-regulated system (Tet-on). In addition an inverted-repeated construct was designed to inactivate DmMRG15 via the RNAi pathway, and RNAi constructs were expressed using both the Tet-on system and Geneswitch system. The DmMRG15 protein was readily expressed in adult flies in a doxycycline-dependent manner. A truncated form of DmMRG15 (called DmMT1) was designed to mimic the structure of human MORF4, and expression of this mutant protein or the inverted-repeat constructs inhibited fertility in females. Conditional expression of the DmMRG15 inverted-repeat constructs during larval development or in adults caused reductions in survival. These experiments indicate that Drosophila DmMRG15 gene function is required for female fertility, larval survival and adult life span, and provide reagents that should be useful for further dissecting the role of DmMRG15 in cell proliferation and aging.",

DC-derived TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12p70 production and expression of DC co-stimulatory molecules did not vary significantly by age indicating that TLR expression, function and signal transduction were intact in aged DC. There were relatively minor age-related changes in TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 which promote Th17 differentiation, but IL-23, a Th17-suvival cytokine, increased more than 40-fold across the lifespan. DC-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) also increased with age and the up-regulation of IL-23 expression by aged DC was blocked by indomethacin that prevents PGE2 production, and by antagonists of PGE2 receptors. Exogenous PGE2 added to DC cultures further enhanced IL-23 production from aged but not young DCs. These data indicate that age-related changes in DC PGE2 production are necessary, but not sufficient to induce DC IL-23 production.

However the effect of Gal on amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) release and \u03b2-site cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression is still unknown. Consequently, we investigated the effect of Gal on the level of A\u03b2 and BACE1. In a differentiated human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), Gal (0.3\u00a0\u03bcM) was found to significantly decrease A\u03b2 release and BACE1 expression following treatment for 6, 12, and 24\u00a0h. Increasing Gal to 0.9\u00a0\u03bcM or 10\u00a0\u03bcM had no further effect. The effect of Gal (0.3\u00a0\u03bcM for 18\u00a0h) was maximal on BACE1 expression but not on A\u03b2 secretion. At higher concentration (0.9\u00a0\u03bcM and 10\u00a0\u03bcM), Gal had no effect on the level of full-length APP but could still stimulate further decrease in A\u03b2 secretion and release of sAPP\u03b1. These observations suggested that 0.3\u00a0\u03bcM Gal exerts its effect on A\u03b2 production by inhibiting BACE1 expression, while 0.9\u00a0\u03bcM or 10\u00a0\u03bcM Gal mainly reduces A\u03b2 production by stimulating the non-amyloidogenic pathway to decrease the amount of APP substrate available for \u03b2-secretase cleavage. In addition, \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR) and multiple second messengers (including PKC, MEK, and p38MAPK) were found to be involved in the regulation of Gal-inhibited A\u03b2 release and BACE1 expression.",

Aortas from young (YC, 6\u00a0months of age) and old (OC, 24\u00a0months of age) rats ad-libitum fed and from old rats caloric-restricted for 3-weeks (OR, 26%) were investigated.

Plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were elevated in OC as well as aortic nitrotyrosine (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and total SOD activity were impaired in OC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs. YC), whereas copper-zinc (CuZn) SOD expression was similar in OC and YC. CR restored endothelial dysfunction in old rats, reduced iNOS expression, total nitrite and calcium-independent NOS activity in aorta (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) without changes in eNOS expression and calcium-dependent NOS activity. Sirtuin-1 expression did not differ among groups. Plasma TBARS and aortic nitrotyrosine were reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in OR compared with OC.

Male Fisher 344 \u00d7 Brown Norway F1-hybrid rats underwent 5\u20137\u00a0mo of treadmill training beginning at late middle age (29\u00a0mo). A 7\u00a0mo sedentary adult group was used to investigate age-related changes. Aging caused an increase in antioxidant enzyme activities; however, only SOD activity was further increased with exercise training. Exercise training did not attenuate the decrease in twitch or tetanic tension of the GAS/Plan or SOL. It did, however, prevent the increase in twitch half relaxation time of the SOL muscle only. Oxidative damage, as reflected in carbonyl content, was increased with age and even further with exercise training in the GAS muscle. Muscle fibre cross sectional area was decreased with age and even further with exercise training. Interestingly, small muscle fibres showed the highest accumulation of carbonyls. Overall, despite an augmentation of select antioxidant enzyme activities, exercise training from late middle age through to senescence had minimal benefits for muscle contractile properties, perhaps in part due to exacerbated oxidation.",

Contractile responses to KCl (60\u00a0mM) and thromboxane A2 were greater in aorta from SAMP8 mice compared with SAMR1 in all groups. Neither ovariectomy nor estrogen replacement modified the contractile responses from SAMR1 mice. Conversely, in Ovx SAMP8 the increased maximal contractions were reversed by estrogen treatment. Rings with endothelium from all SAMR1 groups showed a greater relaxation to acetylcholine than SAMP8 groups. In SAMR1, endothelium-dependent relaxation was not altered in Ovx or Ovx\u00a0+\u00a0E2 groups. Rings from Ovx SAMP8 showed a decreased maximal response to acetylcholine compared to Sham SAMP8. Estrogen replacement restored the response to acetylcholine altered by ovariectomy. Nitric oxide inhibition by L-NAME markedly reduced acetylcholine responses in all groups, but this effect was less pronounced in SAMP8 and Ovx groups (determined by area under the curve reduction). These results indicate that SAMP8 exhibit a significant decreased endothelium-dependent and NO-mediated relaxation and increased vasoconstrictor responses that are potentiated by the lack of estrogen. Because these responses are closely in agreement with vascular dysfunction observed in menopausal women, we propose SAMP8 Ovx as a new model to concomitantly study the effects of aging and menopause in female mice.",

Repetitive loading exercise increased maximal isometric force, negative work and positive work in the dorsiflexors of young adult rats. Only positive work increased in the aged animals that were supplemented with Vitamin E and C. Markers of oxidative stress (H2O2, total GSH, GSH/GSSG ratio, malondialdehyde and 8-OHdG) increased in the tibialis anterior muscles from aged and young adult animals with repetitive loading, but Vitamin E and C supplements attenuated this increase. MnSOD activity increased with supplementation in the young adult animals. CuZnSOD and catalase activity increased with supplementation in young adult and aged animals and GPx activity increased with exercise in the non-supplemented young adult and aged animals. The increased levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes after Vitamin E and C supplementation appear to be regulated by post-transcriptional modifications that are affected differently by age, exercise, and supplementation.

To validate the shift in serum N-glycan profile during ageing, we studied serum N-glycan profiles in different age groups of healthy volunteers, patients with dementia, and patients with Cockayne syndrome, a genetic DNA repair disorder involving neurodegeneration and premature ageing. We found that the log of the ratio of two glycans (NGA2F and NA2F), named GlycoAgeTest, remained steady up to the age of 40\u00a0years and thereafter gradually increased to reach its highest level in nonagenarians. Patients with dementia or Cockayne syndrome had a higher GlycoAgeTest level than age-matched healthy individuals. We thus demonstrate that the value of GlycoAgeTest is better than chronological age for estimating the physiological age of a human individual, and that it could be used as an ageing biomarker for healthy humans.

     "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common dementing disorder of late life. Although there might be various different triggering events in the early stages of the disease, they seem to converge on a few characteristic final pathways in the late stages, characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. In this review, we put forward the hypothesis that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their precursors, including methylglyoxal, are both biomarkers and causative agents (\u201cgerontotoxins\u201d) characteristic for this disorder. Accumulation of AGEs is a normal feature of aging, but is accelerated in AD, where AGEs can be detected in amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. AGE modification may explain many of the neuropathological and biochemical features of AD such as extensive protein cross-linking, inflammation, oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. We suggest that methylglyoxal is one of the major carbonyl species responsible for the formation of AGEs. We propose that one promising pharmacological approach to prevent the formation of AGEs would be to lower the methylglyoxal concentration. This can be achieved, for example, by decreasing the concentration of methylglyoxal precursors such as d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by allowing a higher flux through the pentose phosphate pathway or by increasing methylglyoxal detoxification through the glyoxalase system. Alternatively, methylglyoxal could be scavenged by various types of carbonyl scavengers.",

Besides endogenous formation, significant amounts of AGEs are taken up with food. Although nutritional AGEs are considered as undesirable, proinflammatory agents, they may also enclose potentially beneficial antioxidants. We used rodent cardiac cells to evaluate if food AGEs, present in bread crust, can modify the cellular antioxidant defence. Mice were fed with bread crust containing diet to prove the in-vivo relevance for the heart. In mouse cardiac fibroblasts, bread crust extract induced a moderate elevation of ROS production causing an activation of p42/p44MAPK, p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB, followed by increased expression of antioxidative enzymes. Preconditioning studies demonstrated that this was sufficient to protect cardiac fibroblasts and rat adult cardiac myocytes against severe oxidative stress. Furthermore, mice, fed a bread crust containing diet, exhibited a similarly improved cardiac expression of antioxidative defence genes. The consumption of AGEs can therefore contribute to an improved antioxidant status of the heart, thus exhibiting cardioprotective effects in case of severe oxidative stress as in ischemia reperfusion injury. Also, these data show that the exclusive interpretation of circulating AGEs as pathophysiological biomarkers of ageing might be misleading.",

In this study, we have identified quercetin (QUER) and its derivative, namely quercetin caprylate (QU-CAP) as a proteasome activator with anti-oxidant properties that consequently influence cellular lifespan, survival and viability of HFL-1 primary human fibroblasts. Moreover, when these compounds are supplemented to already senescent fibroblasts, a rejuvenating effect is observed. Finally, we show that these compounds promote physiological alterations when applied to cells (i.e. whitening effect). In summary, these data demonstrate the existence of naturally occurring anti-ageing products that can be effectively used through topical application.",

The absence of quantitative tests for reliability of candidate markers for senescent cells is a major drawback in cell population studies. Fibroblasts in culture constitute mixed populations of proliferation-competent and senescent cells, with transition between these with increasing population doublings (PD). We estimated senescent fraction in human and mouse fibroblasts with high precision from easily observed growth curves using a dynamic simulation model. We also determined senescent fractions, at various PD (over a wide range of senescent cell frequencies) using candidate senescence markers: Ki67, p21 (CDKN1A), \u03b3H2AX, SAHF and Sen-\u03b2-Gal either alone or in combination, and compared with those derived from growth curves. This comparison allowed ranking of candidate markers. High rankings were obtained for Sen-\u03b2-Gal, SAHFs and the combination of Ki67 negativity with high (>5 per nucleus) \u03b3H2A.X foci density in MRC5 fibroblasts. We demonstrate that this latter marker combination, which can easily be performed in paraffin-embedded tissue, gives quantitative senescent cell frequency estimates in mouse embryonic fibroblast cultures and in mouse intestinal sections. The technique presented is a framework for quantitative assessment of markers for senescence.",

Micro- and macrovascular endothelial cells were serially passaged until replicative senescence and their ability to form tube-like structures when cultured on Matrigel was assessed throughout their lifespan. For both cell types low passage cultures adopted a homogeneous cobblestone morphology, while senescent cultures were extremely heterogeneous. Furthermore, both cell types showed a reduction in tube formation ability with in vitro ageing, which is in accordance with the reduction in angiogenic potential observed with ageing in vivo. Examination of senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity revealed an increased activity in cells forming tubes as compared to cells cultured on plastic, which could be attributed to an increased lysosomal content of cells undergoing tube formation. As this increased senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity was unrelated to the replicative age of the cells, senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity may not be a relevant senescence marker for differentiating endothelial cells. The age-related reduction in tube formation ability suggested that long-term culture of endothelial cells may be a valid model system of vascular ageing, which makes it an ideal platform for high throughput screening of compounds influencing angiogenesis.",

We analyzed sarcomere shortening and calcium transients (Indo-1 fluorescence) of voltage clamped ventricular myocytes and myofilament ATPase activity (malachite green assay). Expression of calcium handling proteins (Western blots) and NADPH oxidase subunits (real-time PCR) was quantified, as well as NADPH oxidase activity (lucigenin chemiluminescence).We found that aged myocytes showed decelerated shortening/relengthening without changes in fractional shortening. Calcium transient decay was similarly decelerated, but the amplitude of calcium transients was increased with aging. Calcium sensitivity of myofilaments of aged myocytes was reduced. These age-dependent changes occurred without altered calcium handling protein expression but were reversed by the superoxide scavenger tiron.Aged myocytes showed increased NADPH oxidase expression and activity. Pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium; apocynin) normalized age-dependent deceleration of shortening/relengthening.In summary, we show that increased superoxide formation by upregulated NADPH oxidase contributes significantly to age-dependent alterations in calcium handling and contractility of murine ventricular myocytes.",

In the absence of such precipitating factors old age induces a reduction of renal functional reserve. It is well known that even modest declines in renal excretory function enhance the cardiovascular risk of the patient by means of myocardial remodelling, arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis. An important non-traditional risk factor for vascular disease is chronic inflammation. Patients with renal dysfunction tend to have systemic inflammatory activation even in the absence of infection. Subclinical inflammation might be related to cellular senescence mechanisms in leukocytes that are fostered by renal insufficiency. This effect as well as enhanced oxidative stress resemble typical characteristics of both advanced ageing and renal failure.

Changes in endocrine pathways accompany healthy ageing, these include the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-I axis (somatopause) and that of sexual hormones, namely estradiol (menopause), testosterone (andropause), and dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulphate (adrenopause). The clinical significance of these changes is variable and results in morphological and functional alterations of all organ systems including the skin and the central nervous system. Moreover, the pathogenesis of age-associated diseases such as epithelial skin cancer and neurodegenerative diseases has been partly attributed to the lack of hormones. Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to reverse the ageing process and clinical signs by substitution of the serum hormone levels in older individuals, however the benefits of hormone replacement therapy, if any, are still controversial. On the other hand, recent data suggest that skin is a window to the human organism and represents an adequate model for ageing research, also implying the use of skin samples for evaluating the ageing status of the central nervous system.",

     "abstract": "Although most literature suggests a relative protection of slow twitch muscle with aging, there is limited data in senescence when muscle atrophy and functional decline markedly accelerate. To address this issue we examined age-related changes in muscle mass, contractile function, mitochondrial enzyme activities, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression in the slow twitch soleus (Sol) and fast twitch gastrocnemius (Gas) muscle of young adult (YA) and senescent (SEN) rats. Muscle mass declined between YA and SEN in the Sol by 35% compared to 55% in the Gas muscle. After normalizing for muscle mass, tetanic force per g of muscle declined by 58% in Sol and by 36% in Gas muscle. Time-to-peak tension was increased only in the Gas (30%), whereas time-to-half relaxation was increased by 70% in Sol and 51% in Gas. Citrate synthase and complex IV activity declined in homogenates of Sol (30\u201336%) and red oxidative region of Gas (46\u201351%), but not white glycolytic region of Gas. Strikingly, the shift away from the dominant adult MHC isoform with aging was much greater in Sol (fibers positive for MHC fast: 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% in YA versus 36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% in SEN) than in Gas (fibers positive for MHC slow: 12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% in YA versus 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% in SEN) muscle. Collectively, these results show that the slow twitch Sol muscle undergoes large phenotypic alterations in very old age and for several measures (tetanic tension per g, time-to-half relaxation and shift in adult MHC expression) that is of greater magnitude than fast twitch muscle, underscoring the importance of including age-related changes in slow twitch muscle in seeking potential treatments for sarcopenia.",

Another hypothesis is that the maintenance with aging of both appendicular muscle and bone mass may be determined by factors independent of all these previous factors, including genetic factors. In 160 healthy men aged 20 to 72\u00a0years, we recorded femoral neck bone mineral density (FN BMD), relative appendicular skeletal muscle mass [RASM; appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)\u00a0/\u00a0height (cm)], age, body mass, maximum grip and knee extension strength, lifetime physical activities, calcium intake, tobacco smoking, and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), estradiol (E2), free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D, albumin, and creatinine clearance. The correlation between FN BMD and RASM (that includes upper and lower limb muscle mass) was of slightly greater magnitude than that between FN BMD and the relative upper limb muscle mass and between FN BMD and the relative leg muscle mass (r\u00a0=\u00a00.39; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001 versus r\u00a0=\u00a00.36; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001 and r\u00a0=\u00a00.34; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001, respectively). The stepwise multiple linear regression model showed that FN BMD was significantly associated with RASM (15% of FN BMD variance, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), age (10% of FN BMD variance, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), physical activities from age 11\u201320\u00a0years (5% of FN BMD variance, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and blood PTH, IGF-I, and creatinine clearance, (2%, 2%, and 1% of FN BMD variance, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These results show that RASM, with ASM measured by DXA, is the strongest factor associated with FN BMD in men. It remains to be determined whether assessing RASM by anthropometric methods would help screening adult men at risk of low FN BMD. Furthermore, since RASM is associated with FN BMD independently of appendicular skeletal loads and other lifestyle, nutritional, and hormonal factors, this suggests that common factors, possibly genetic factors, might also influence the coupled maintenance of appendicular muscle mass and FN BMD in adult men.",

     "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) has been used for decades to retard aging in rodents, but its mechanism of action remains an enigma. A principal roadblock has been that DR affects many different processes, making it difficult to distinguish cause and effect. To address this problem, we applied a quantitative genetics approach utilizing the ILSXISS series of mouse recombinant inbred strains. Across 42 strains, mean female lifespan ranged from 380 to 1070\u00a0days on DR (fed 60% of ad libitum [AL]) and from 490 to 1020\u00a0days on an AL diet. Longevity under DR and AL is under genetic control, showing 34% and 36% heritability, respectively. There was no correlation between lifespans on DR and AL; thus different genes modulate longevity under the two regimens. DR lifespans are significantly correlated with female fertility after return to an AL diet after various periods of DR (R\u00a0=\u00a00.44, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). We assessed fuel efficiency (FE, ability to maintain growth and body weight independent of absolute food intake) using a multivariate approach and found it to be correlated with longevity and female fertility, suggesting possible causality. We found several quantitative trait loci responsible for these traits, mapping to chromosomes 7, 9, and 15. We present a metabolic model in which the anti-aging effects of DR are consistent with the ability to efficiently utilize dietary resources.",

Glucose uptake in whole body and skeletal muscle was reduced with aging in both wild-type and iNOS knockout mice and there was no difference between two groups.

Present investigation was aimed to validate this trend. An analysis of 510 subjects aged 75\u2013103\u00a0years revealed 205 (40%) CASP5 Ala90Thr heterozygotes as compared to 254 (50%) expected from the minor allele frequency 0.470 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000014). This deviation was not observed in 549 middle-aged (18\u201350\u00a0years) controls (270 (49%) heterozygotes observed vs. 274 (50%) expected; minor allele frequency 0.475; p\u00a0=\u00a00.743).

Seven major sites of superoxide production in mammalian mitochondria are known and widely accepted. In descending order of maximum capacity they are the ubiquinone-binding sites in complex I (site IQ) and complex III (site IIIQo), glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the flavin in complex I (site IF), the electron transferring flavoprotein:Q oxidoreductase (ETFQOR) of fatty acid beta-oxidation, and pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases. None of these sites is fully characterized and for some we only have sketchy information. The topology of the sites is important because it determines whether or not a site will produce superoxide in the mitochondrial matrix and be able to damage mitochondrial DNA. All sites produce superoxide in the matrix; site IIIQo and glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase also produce superoxide to the intermembrane space. The relative contribution of each site to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation in the absence of electron transport inhibitors is unknown in isolated mitochondria, in cells or in vivo, and may vary considerably with species, tissue, substrate, energy demand and oxygen tension.",

In contrast, oocytes appear to have the ability to select against deleterious mutations in mtDNA, at least in mice. This fundamental difference suggests that oocytes may be better able to detect and remove defective mtDNA genomes than somatic cells, possibly due in part to the simpler organization of the mtDNA in smaller nucleoids.

Thus, DNA repair is an important mechanism for maintenance of genomic integrity. Despite the importance of mitochondria in the aging process, it was thought for many years that mitochondria lacked an enzymatic DNA repair system comparable to that in the nuclear compartment.

Furthermore, genetic alterations of mitochondrial function may either shorten or extend life span.

This process must be viewed as cooperating with the cellular degradation processes like autophagy, proteasomal degradation and others. Together, these two mechanisms guarantee survival of the species and prevent clonal senescence of unicellular organisms, like yeast. It is widely believed that oxidative damage to proteins is primarily caused by oxygen radicals and their follow-up products produced in the mitochondria. As we have shown previously, old yeast mother cells in contrast to young cells contain reactive oxygen species and undergo programmed cell death. Here we show that aconitase of the mitochondrial matrix is readily inactivated by oxidative stress, but even in its inactive form is relatively long-lived and retains fluorescence in the Aco1p-eGFP form. The fluorescent protein is distributed between old mothers and their daughters approximately corresponding to the different sizes of mother and daughter cells. However, the remaining active enzyme is primarily inherited by the daughter cells. This indicates that asymmetric distribution of the still active enzyme takes place and a mechanism for discrimination between active and inactive enzyme must exist. As the aconitase remains mitochondrial during aging and cell division, our findings could indicate discrimination between active and no longer active mitochondria during the process.",

Knock out of the cytochrome respiratory pathway induces the expression of an alternative oxidase and is associated with a reduction in free radical production. The question of the links between mtDNA stability, ROS generation and lifespan is therefore clearly raised in this organism. NADPH lies at the heart of many anti-oxidant defenses of the cell. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mitochondrial NADPH is largely provided by the Pos5 NADH kinase. We show here that disruption of PaNdk1 encoding the potential mitochondrial NADH kinase of P. anserina leads to severe somatic and sexual defects and to hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. Surprisingly, it also leads to a spectacular increase of mtDNA stability and lifespan.

Therefore, preventing damage accumulation may delay aging and help to prevent degenerative disorders, especially those associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans a mild mitochondrial dysfunction prolongs the lifespan. We previously proposed that, following a mild mitochondrial dysfunction, protective stress responses are activated in a hormetic-like fashion, and ultimately account for extended animal\u2019s lifespan. We recently showed that in C. elegans, lifespan extension induced by reduced expression of different mitochondrial proteins involved in electron transport chain functionality requires p53/cep-1. In this paper we find that reducing the expression of frataxin, the protein defective in patients with Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, triggers a complex stress response, and that the associated induction of the antioxidant glutathione-S-transferase is regulated by cep-1. Given the high percentage of homology between human and nematode genes and the conservation of fundamental intracellular pathways between the two species, identification of molecular mechanisms activated in response to frataxin suppression in C. elegans may suggest novel therapeutic approaches to prevent the accumulation of irreversible damage and the consequent appearance of symptoms in Friedreich\u2019s ataxia and possibly other human mitochondrial-associated diseases.

This regulation of mitochondrial TERT is reminiscent of the situation in the nucleus from where TERT is exported under conditions of oxidative stress in a Src kinase dependent manner.

Complex I was present solely in supercomplexes and those lacking complex IV were least stable in aged animals (2.4-fold decline).

Transcriptomes obtained at 45\u00a0days, 90% and 50% survival were then compared between them to focus more on genes up- or down-regulated in presence of higher levels of hsp22 mRNA. Hsp22+ flies display an up-regulation of genes mainly related to mitochondrial energy production and protein biosynthesis, two functions normally down-regulated during aging. Interestingly, among the 26 genes up-regulated in Hsp22+ flies, 7 genes encode for mitochondrial proteins, 5 of which being involved in OXPHOS complexes. Other genes that could influence aging such as CG5002, dGCC185 and GstS1 also displayed a regulation linked to Hsp22 expression. The up-regulation of genes of the OXPHOS system in Hsp22+ flies suggest that mitochondrial homeostasis is at the center of Hsp22 beneficial effects on lifespan.",

However, the limited gene expression studies to date are not informative, because they have been conducted using cells grown in batch culture which markedly departs from the conditions under which yeasts are grown during life span determinations. In this study, we have examined the gene expression changes that occur during either glucose limitation or elimination of nonessential-amino acids, both of which enhance yeast longevity, culturing cells in a chemostat at equilibrium, which closely mimicks conditions they encounter during life span determinations. Expression of 59 genes was examined quantitatively by real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the physiological state of the cultures was monitored. Extensive gene expression changes were detected, some of which were common to both CR regimes. The most striking of these was the induction of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and retrograde response target genes, which appears to be at least partially due to the up-regulation of the HAP4 gene. These gene regulatory events portend an increase in the generation of biosynthetic intermediates necessary for the production of daughter cells, which is the measure of yeast replicative life span.",

A re-examination of data from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (with normal and chemically accelerated in vitro ageing), revealed similar age-dependent alterations of voltage-dependent anion channel isoforms.Building on these results, we examined the expression of VDAC-1 in an in vitro model of excitotoxicity.

     "abstract": "Mitotic cells in culture show a limited replicative potential and after extended subculturing undergo a terminal growth arrest termed cellular senescence. When cells reach the senescent phenotype, this is accompanied by a significant change in the cellular phenotype and massive changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of secreted factors. In human fibroblasts, senescent cells also acquire resistance to apoptosis. In contrary, in human endothelial cells, both replicative and stress-induced premature senescence is accompanied by increased cell death; however mechanisms of cell death are poorly explored. In this communication, we addressed the role of endonuclease G (EndoG), a mitochondrial mediator of caspase-independent cell death, in senescence-associated cell death of human endothelial cells. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found, that EndoG is localized in the mitochondria in young cells, but relocalizes to the nucleus upon senescence. When EndoG gene expression was downregulated by lentiviral shRNA vectors, we found a significant reduction in the replicative life span and a corresponding increase in cell death. We also observed a slight shift in the cell death phenotype from necrosis to apoptosis. Together these observations suggest an important role of EndoG in the senescence program of human endothelial cells.",

While many studies have shown that NAD+ is important when lifespan is modulated by dietary means, it is uncertain whether or how NAD+ affects either formation or elimination of altered proteins. It is suggested here that changes in NAD+ availability can affect generation of methylglyoxal (MG) from glycolytic intermediates, which in turn can damage proteins, promote generation of reactive oxygen species and induce mitochondrial dysfunction. The proposal can also help to explain how, by altering NAD+ regeneration from NADH, dietary supplementation with glycerol or glucose, which decreases lifespan in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, could cause MG generation to increase, whereas oxaloacetate supplementation, which increases lifespan, could lower the potential for MG formation. The proposal also suggests how upregulation of mitogenesis and mitochondrial activity, and increased aerobic activity, help to decrease the potential for MG formation and resultant proteotoxicity, with consequential beneficial effects with respect to aging.",

     "abstract": "Overall reductions in muscle strength typically accompany the aging process. However, older adults show a relatively preserved capacity of producing eccentric strength. The preservation of eccentric strength in older adults is a well-established phenomenon, occurring indiscriminately across different muscle groups, independent of age-related architectural changes in muscle structure and velocity of movement.The mechanisms for the preservation of eccentric strength appear to be mechanical and cellular in origin and include both passive and active elements regulating muscle stiffness. The age-related accumulation of non-contractile material in the muscle-tendon unit increases passive stiffness, which might offer mechanical advantage during eccentric contractions. In addition, the preserved muscle tension and increased instantaneous stiffness of old muscle fibers during stretch increase active stiffness, which might enhance eccentric strength.The fact that the preservation of eccentric strength is present in people with chronic conditions when compared to age-matched healthy controls indicates that the aging process per se does not exclusively mediate the preservation of eccentric strength. Physical inactivity, which is common in elderly and people with chronic conditions, is a potential factor regulating the preservation of eccentric strength.When compared to concentric strength, the magnitude of preservation of eccentric strength in older adults ranges from 2% to 48% with a mean value of 21.6% from all studies. This functional reserve of eccentric strength might be clinically relevant, especially to initiate resistance training and rehabilitation programs in individuals with low levels of strength.",

     "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that calorie restriction and specifically reduced glucose metabolism induces mitochondrial metabolism to extend life span in various model organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and possibly mice. In conflict with Harman\u2019s free radical theory of aging (FRTA), these effects may be due to increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the mitochondria causing an adaptive response that culminates in subsequently increased stress resistance assumed to ultimately cause a long-term reduction of oxidative stress. This type of retrograde response has been named mitochondrial hormesis or mitohormesis, and may in addition be applicable to the health-promoting effects of physical exercise in humans and, hypothetically, impaired insulin/IGF-1-signaling in model organisms. Consistently, abrogation of this mitochondrial ROS signal by antioxidants impairs the lifespan-extending and health-promoting capabilities of glucose restriction and physical exercise, respectively. In summary, the findings discussed in this review indicate that ROS are essential signaling molecules which are required to promote health and longevity. Hence, the concept of mitohormesis provides a common mechanistic denominator for the physiological effects of physical exercise, reduced calorie uptake, glucose restriction, and possibly beyond.",

In recent studies, we examined molecular mechanism of zingerone treatment on pro-inflammatory NF-\u03baB activation via the redox-related NIK/IKK and MAPK pathways. Action mechanism of zingerone on NF-\u03baB signaling was investigated in aged rat kidney and endothelial cells. The results showed that zingerone had not only the antioxidant effect by constitutive suppression of ROS, but also anti-inflammatory effects by suppression of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activation in aged rat. In addition, zingerone treatment suppressed gene activation of pro-inflammatory enzymes, COX-2 and iNOS, which were upregulated with aging through NF-\u03baB activation and IKK/MAPK signaling pathway. These experiments strongly indicate that zingerone treatment exerts a beneficial efficacy by suppressing both oxidative stress and age-related inflammation through the modulation of several key pro-inflammatory genes and transcription factors. Thus, the significance of our findings is that the zingerone treatment may provide some preventive measure against chronic inflammatory conditions that underlie many age-related inflammatory diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, dementia, arthritis, diabetes, osteoprosis, and cancers.",

Twenty-two older adults were assigned to either a training group (TG; n\u00a0=\u00a012, 73.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9\u00a0yr) or a non-training control group (CG; n\u00a0=\u00a010, 70.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6\u00a0yr). TG participated in a 7-week individualized walking interval training at intensities progressing from 50 to 100% of ventilatory threshold ( T \u02d9 VE ). Aerobic fitness [maximal oxygen uptake ( V \u02d9 O 2 max ) and T \u02d9 VE ], preferred walking speed (PWS), gross and net Cw (GCw and NCw, respectively) and relative effort (% V \u02d9 O 2 max ) at PWS measured before training (PWS1) were assessed prior and following the intervention. All outcomes were measured on a treadmill. Significant improvements in GCw (\u22128%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007), NCw (\u221212%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), relative effort (% V \u02d9 O 2 max : \u221212%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and PWS (+12%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were observed in TG but not in CG (P\u00a0>\u00a00.71).

The decreased Cw at PWS1, with no concomitant improvement in aerobic fitness, represents the main contributing factor for the reduction of the relative effort at this speed. This also allows elderly people to increase their PWS post training. Therefore, the present walking training may be an effective way to improve walking performance and delay mobility impairment in older adults.",

Also, the pharmacological activation of NST revealed similar increased levels of O2 consumption in adult and aged animals, confirming that no age effect could be evidenced on NST activation at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. However, preliminary histological data revealed a lack of lipid resources in one aged individual during cold exposure. Surprisingly, the pharmacological activation of NST revealed an impaired evacuation of the excess body heat in aged animals, associated with increased energy expenditure.Thus, aging seems to be related to decreased capacities in the maintenance of NST rather than in its activation.

In order to reach this objective, we analyzed the phenotype of spinal curvature and expression of genes related to the anti-oxidant defense system and myogenesis in muscle of 8 and 30\u00a0months old GH-transgenic males.

Retention test sessions were performed 1.5 and 24\u00a0h after training, in order to assess short-term and long-term memory, respectively. Results indicated that aged animals that received iron in the neonatal period showed more severe memory deficits than vehicle-treated ones, suggesting that iron potentiates age-associated memory impairments. Rosuvastatin improved recognition memory deficits associated with iron loading and aging, providing evidence that statins may be considered for the treatment of age-associated cognitive decline.",

Neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus continues throughout life, but steadily declines from early adulthood. Apoptosis occurs under various pathologic and physiologic conditions, and excessive apoptotic cell death can cause a number of functional disorders in humans. Apoptosis in the hippocampus also disturbs cognitive functions. In this study, we examined the effect of treadmill exercise on memory in relation to neurogensis and apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of old-aged rats. The present results showed that loss of memory by aging was associated with a decrease in neurogenesis and an increase in apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Treadmill exercise improved short-term and spatial memories by enhancing neurogenesis and suppressing apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of old-aged rats. In the present study, we showed that treadmill exercise is a very useful strategy for preventing failure of memory in the elderly.",

Across a panel of 21 tissues, we used RT-PCR to evaluate the effects of the PappA(\u2212/\u2212) mutation on expression of Igfbp5, which served as an in vivo indicator of IGF-1 signaling. Among these tissues, expression of Igfbp5 was significantly reduced by PappA(\u2212/\u2212) only in kidney. A broader survey of IGF-associated genes in six organs identified five other genes responsive to PappA(\u2212/\u2212) in kidney, with stronger effects in this organ relative to other tissues. Renal expression of Irs1 and Mt1 was increased by PappA(\u2212/\u2212) as well as by mutations that reduce IGF-1 in serum (i.e., Ghr(\u2212/\u2212), Pit1(dw/dw) and Prop1(df/df)), and we demonstrate that expression of these genes is regulated by growth hormone-treatment and calorie restriction.

Less is known regarding the effect of aging-associated oxidative stress on the inflammatory response in injured skeletal muscle. The purpose of this project was to assess the level of oxidative stress in skeletal muscles of young, adult, and old rats and determine its effect on the acute inflammatory response to a contusion injury. Inherent oxidative stress in the muscle was determined by measuring the glutathione:glutathione disulfide ratio, and levels of GP91phox. Elevated oxidative stress was observed in uninjured muscles of adult and old rats and was accompanied by increased levels of lipid peroxidation and neutrophil chemoattractant CINC-1. After injury, the acute inflammatory response (8\u00a0h, 3 d) was determined from markers of neutrophil (myeloperoxidase) and macrophage (CD68) content and by expression of NF\u03baB, CINC-1 and TGF-\u03b21. Compared to injured muscles of young rats, NF\u03baB, myeloperoxidase activity (8\u00a0h), macrophage content (3 d), and TGF-\u03b21 (8\u00a0h and 3 d) were significantly greater in injured muscles of old rats. We conclude that aging-associated oxidative stress in muscles of old rats exacerbated the inflammatory response to contusion injury and leads to increased TGF-\u03b21-induced collagen content.",

The aim of this study was to determine if signs of denervation were apparent at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) before fiber atrophy, or fiber type conversion could be documented, and to reveal if a muscle\u2019s activity level impacts its sensitivity to age-related denervation. Plantaris and soleus muscles were obtained from young adult (10\u00a0months) and early aged (21\u00a0months) rats. Pre- and post-synaptic NMJ morphology was quantified with cytofluorescent staining of nerve terminal branches and endplate regions, respectively. Myofiber profiles (fiber size and fiber type composition) were assessed with histochemical procedures. Results show that in the lightly recruited plantaris, significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) signs of denervation were noted in aged rats, while the same muscles displayed no change in myofiber profile. In the heavily recruited soleus, however, there was little evidence of denervation, and again no alterations in myofiber profile. These results indicate that age-related denervation occurs before myofiber atrophy, and that high amounts of neuromuscular activity may delay the onset of age-related denervation and sarcopenia.",

Thus gene expression can be repressed through post-transcriptional regulation, implemented as a \u2018dimmer switch\u2019, in contrast to the all-or-none mode of suppression. Work from our laboratory and others shows that during aging, dysregulated expression of microRNAs generally occurs in groups, suggesting that their actions may be functionally coordinated as a \u2018pack\u2019 by common transcriptional regulators; the accumulation of these \u2018pack\u2019 disorganizations may be the underlying culprit contributing to the pathoetiology of many age-dependent disease states. The fact that many microRNAs are coordinated in their expression, due to either the close proximity of their genomic locations or sharing the same transcriptional regulation, suggests that future strategies for correcting age-dependent microRNA disorganization may need to involve a system biology, rather than a reductionist, approach. Therefore, understanding age-dependent changes of microRNA expression in \u2018packs\u2019 may open an entirely new frontier, i.e. how particular groups of non-coding RNAs, functioning together, contribute to mechanisms regulating aging and longevity.",

Examination of gene expression changes in aged HSCs has provided a link between aging and genomic instability. Furthermore, studies on the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on HSC aging has given more insight into the reasons for HSC failure.

     "abstract": "The neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the 6th leading cause of death in the USA. In addition to neurological and psychiatric symptoms, AD is characterized by deficiencies in S-adenylmethionine (SAM), vitamin B12, and folate. Deficiency in these nutrients has been shown to result in gene promoter methylation with upregulation of AD-associated genes. While some cases of AD are due to specific mutations in genes such as presenilin 1 (PSEN) and the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide precursor protein (APP), these familial AD (FAD) cases account for a minority of cases. The majority of genetic contribution consists of risk factors with incomplete penetrance. Several environmental risk factors, such as cholesterol and diet, head trauma, and reduced levels of exercise, have also been determined for AD. Nevertheless, the majority of risk for AD appears to be established early in life. We propose to explain this via the LEARn (Latent Early-life Associated Regulation) model. LEARn-AD (LAD) would be a \u201ctwo-hit\u201d disorder, wherein the first hit would occur due to environmental stress within the regulatory sequences of AD-associated genes, maintained by epigenetic changes such as in DNA methylation. This hit would most likely come in early childhood. The second hit could consist of further stress, such as head trauma, poor mid-life diet, or even general changes in expression of genes that occur later in life independent of any pathogenesis. Given that the primary risk for LAD would be maintained by DNA (hypo)methylation, we propose that long-term nutritional remediation based on the LEARn model, or LEARn-based nutritional gain (LEARnING), beginning early in life, would significantly reduce risk for AD late in life.",

     "abstract": "During the last decade evidence has accumulated that the aging process is driven by limited allocation of energy to somatic maintenance resulting in accumulation of stochastic damage. This damage, affecting molecules, cells, and tissues, is counteracted by genetically programmed repair, the efficiency of which thus importantly determines the life and \u2018health span\u2019 of organisms. Therefore, understanding the regulation of gene expression during cellular and organismal aging as well as upon exposure to various damaging events is important to understand the biology of aging and to positively influence the health span. The recent identification of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), has added an additional layer of complexity to the regulation of gene expression with the classes of endogenous small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), QDE1-interacting RNAs (qiRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Some of these ncRNAs have not yet been identified in mammalian cells and are dependent on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The first mammalian enzyme with such activity has only now emerged and surprisingly consists of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) together with RMPR, an alternative RNA component. The so far most studied small non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, however, are now increasingly found to operate in the complex network of cellular aging. Recent findings show that (i) miRNAs are regulated during cellular senescence in vitro, (ii) they contribute to tissue regeneration by regulation of stem cell function, and (iii) at least one miRNA modulates the life span of the model organism C. elegans. Additionally, (iv) they act as inhibitors of proteins mediating the insulin/IGF1 and target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling, both of which are conserved modulators of organism life span. Here we will give an overview on the current status of these topics. Since little is so far known on the functions of small ncRNAs in the context of aging and longevity, the entry of the RNA world into the field of biogerontology certainly holds additional surprises and promises. Even more so, as miRNAs are implicated in many age-associated pathologies, and as RNAi and miRNA based therapeutics are on their way to clinics.",

The mechanisms causing age-dependent DNA demethylation are unclear. Maintenance of DNA methylation depends on DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels, and is inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAM levels depend on dietary micronutrients including folate and methionine. SAH levels depend on serum homocysteine concentrations. T cell Dnmt1 levels also decline with age. We hypothesized that age-dependent Dnmt1 decreases synergize with low folate, low methionine or high homocysteine levels to demethylate and activate methylation-sensitive genes. T cells from healthy adults ages 22\u201381, stimulated and cultured with low folate, low methionine, or high homocysteine concentrations showed demethylation and overexpression of KIR and CD70 beginning at age \u223c50 and increased further with age. The effects were reproduced by Dnmt1 knockdowns in T cells from young subjects. These results indicate that maintenance of T cell DNA methylation patterns is more sensitive to low folate and methionine levels in older than younger individuals, due to low Dnmt1 levels, and that homocysteine further increases aberrant gene expression. Thus, attention to proper nutrition may be particularly important in the elderly.",

     "abstract": "Harman\u2019s free radical theory of aging posits that oxidized macromolecules accumulate with age to decrease function and shorten life-span. However, nutritional and genetic interventions to boost anti-oxidants have generally failed to increase life-span. Furthermore, the free radical theory fails to explain why exercise causes higher levels of oxyradical damage, but generally promotes healthy aging. The separate anti-aging paradigms of genetic or caloric reductions in the insulin signaling pathway is thought to slow the rate of living to reduce metabolism, but recent evidence from Westbrook and Bartke suggests metabolism actually increases in long-lived mice. To unify these disparate theories and data, here, we propose the epigenetic oxidative redox shift (EORS) theory of aging. According to EORS, sedentary behavior associated with age triggers an oxidized redox shift and impaired mitochondrial function. In order to maintain resting energy levels, aerobic glycolysis is upregulated by redox-sensitive transcription factors. As emphasized by DeGrey, the need to supply NAD+ for glucose oxidation and maintain redox balance with impaired mitochondrial NADH oxidoreductase requires the upregulation of other oxidoreductases. In contrast to the 2% inefficiency of mitochondrial reduction of oxygen to the oxyradical, these other oxidoreductases enable glycolytic energy production with a deleterious 100% efficiency in generating oxyradicals. To avoid this catastrophic cycle, lactate dehydrogenase is upregulated at the expense of lactic acid acidosis. This metabolic shift is epigenetically enforced, as is insulin resistance to reduce mitochondrial turnover. The low mitochondrial capacity for efficient production of energy reinforces a downward spiral of more sedentary behavior leading to accelerated aging, increased organ failure with stress, impaired immune and vascular functions and brain aging. Several steps in the pathway are amenable to reversal for exit from the vicious cycle of EORS. Examples from our work in the aging rodent brain as well as other aging models are provided.",

The former is proposed effectively to set a \u2018program\u2019 for the increase of mortality risk with age, and may be a better measure of the \u2018rate of ageing\u2019 which has previously been assumed to determine the slope of semi-logarithmic mortality curves.Entire human mortality curves are shown here to be compatible with this single distribution given the assumption that individuals vary only with respect to the interactive risk parameter (k). Historical Swedish cohort data are modelled here exclusively through changes in k values, clustered increasingly toward the higher end of their range, while redundancy values are held constant. This pattern is compatible with the hypothesis that historical changes in human mortality may be explained purely in terms of interactive risks and without changes in the underlying pattern or rate of ageing.",

All these effects much more evident for the dose of 20\u00a0mg/kg sitagliptin. The long-term inhibition of the endogenous DPP-4 enzymes with sitagliptin can significantly delay some forms of AD pathology, including amyloid deposition, when administered early in the disease course of a transgenic mouse model of AD.",

Because Western analysis of APE, DNA polymerase \u03b2 and DNA ligase III levels in the F/PCTX of both CR and AL rats remained unchanged with age, this suggests that the increased APE activity in CR rats is the result of differential post-translational modification of APE.",

It therefore becomes imperative to elucidate the components and function of novel therapeutic strategies against oxidative stress to further clinical diagnosis and care. In particular, both the growth factor and cytokine erythropoietin (EPO) and members of the mammalian forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FoxOs) may offer the greatest promise for new treatment regimens since these agents and the cellular pathways they oversee cover a range of critical functions that directly influence progenitor cell development, cell survival and degeneration, metabolism, immune function, and cancer cell invasion. Furthermore, both EPO and FoxOs function not only as therapeutic targets, but also as biomarkers of disease onset and progression, since their cellular pathways are closely linked and overlap with several unique signal transduction pathways. However, biological outcome with EPO and FoxOs may sometimes be both unexpected and undesirable that can raise caution for these agents and warrant further investigations. Here we present the exciting as well as complicated role EPO and FoxOs possess to uncover the benefits as well as the risks of these agents for cell biology and clinical care in processes that range from stem cell development to uncontrolled cellular proliferation.",

Therefore, examining the molecular mechanisms that control cell and replicative senescence is of great interest for biology and medicine. Several discoveries strongly support telomere shortening as the main molecular mechanism that limits the growth of normal cells. Although cultures gradually approach their growth limit, appearance of individual senescent cells is sudden and stochastic. A theoretical model of abrupt telomere shortening has been proposed in order to explain this phenomenon, but until now there was no reliable experimental evidence supporting this idea. Here, we have employed novel methodology to provide evidence for the generation of extrachromosomal circular telomeric DNA as a result of abrupt telomere shortening in normal human fibroblasts. This mechanism ensures heterogeneity in growth potential among individual cells, which is crucial for gradual progression of the aging process.",

However, little is known about its potential anti-aging properties especially at the organismal level. Here we evaluated the effect of a\u00e7ai pulp on modulating lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that a\u00e7ai supplementation at 2% in the food increased the lifespan of female flies fed a high fat diet compared to the non-supplemented control. We measured transcript changes induced by a\u00e7ai for age-related genes. Although transcript levels of most genes tested were not altered, a\u00e7ai increased the transcript level of l(2)efl, a small heat-shock-related protein, and two detoxification genes, GstD1 and MtnA, while decreasing the transcript level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck), a key gene involved in gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, a\u00e7ai increased the lifespan of oxidative stressed females caused by sod1 RNAi. This suggests that a\u00e7ai improves survival of flies fed a high fat diet through activation of stress response pathways and suppression of Pepck expression. A\u00e7ai has the potential to antagonize the detrimental effect of fat in the diet and alleviate oxidative stress in aging.",

F. tularensis is a Gram-negative intracellular pathogen that can cause a severe pneumonia. In this study both young (8\u201312\u00a0week old) and aged (20\u201324\u00a0month old) mice were infected intranasally with LVS. Lung tissues from young and aged mice were used to assess pathology, recruitment of immune cell types and cytokine expression levels at various times post infection. Bacterial burdens were also assessed. Interestingly, the lungs of aged animals harbored fewer organisms at early time points of infection (day 1, day 3) compared with their younger counterparts. In addition, only aged animals displayed small perivascular aggregates at these early time points that appeared mostly mononuclear in nature. However, the kinetics of infiltrating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and increased cytokine levels measured in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were delayed in infected aged animals relative to young infected animals with neutrophils appearing at day 5 post infection (PI) in the aged animals as opposed to day 3 PI in the young infected animals. Also evident were alterations in the ratios of mononuclear to PMNs at distinct post infection times. The above evidence indicates that aged mice elicit an altered immune response in the lung to respiratory F. tularensis LVS infections compared to their younger counterparts.",

Modulation of IL-15 levels has been suggested as a treatment for sarcopenia and age-associated increases in adiposity. However, it is unclear whether IL-15 levels change during aging, as measurement of IL-15 at physiological concentrations in mice has been technically difficult, and translational regulation of IL-15 is complex. Moreover, the IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15R\u03b1) can comprise part of a membrane-associated receptor complex, or appear as a soluble form which stabilizes IL-15 and facilitates IL-15 secretion. Here, we report measurement of physiological levels of murine IL-15, and determine that muscle and serum IL-15 levels decline progressively with age. However, expression of IL-15 mRNA and membrane-associated subunits of the IL-15 receptor did not change with age in muscle. Expression of soluble IL-15R\u03b1 (sIL-15R\u03b1) mRNA declined 5-fold with age, and serum IL-15 levels correlated highly with muscle sIL-15 mRNA expression, suggesting declines in sIL-15R\u03b1 expression lead to decreased circulating IL-15 levels during aging. These findings complement studies which described several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human IL-15R\u03b1 gene which impact muscularity and adiposity, and provide a technical basis for further investigation of IL-15 and the sIL-15R\u03b1 in determining body composition in aging mice, as a model for humans.",

     "abstract": "Recent studies have indicated that flies respond to dilute food solutions by compensatory feeding. The existence of compensation mechanisms calls for a reconsideration of the relationships between diet, feeding behaviour and longevity. This study shows that flies fed on liquid diets, sense sucrose and yeast nutrients and adapt to changes in the quantity and presentation of the two nutrients. They have a marked preference for sucrose and regulate their sucrose intake more tightly than their yeast intake. These preferences are not modified as fly age from 1 to 30\u00a0days. Compensatory feeding suppresses the beneficial action of dietary restriction on longevity when flies are fed on liquid diets supplemented with yeast extracts. Flies which are given the choice to feed on separate yeast and sucrose food sources were longer lived than flies fed on nutrient mixtures. We conclude that flies sense and respond to specific nutrients and that food presentation is a major factor which determines the sensitivity of flies to dietary restriction.",

The rise of cholesterolemia is one of the main risk factors for coronary disease. Since 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, it plays a pivotal role in cholesterol homeostasis maintenance. Aim of this study is to investigate whether HMGR is involved in the cholesterolemia increase that occurs during aging, and to consider its potential role as a target for estrogen protective effects. \u201cIn vivo\u201d studies have been performed using the livers of 12-month-old female rats (whose estrogen level decrease is comparable to the one detected at the occurrence of human menopause), 12-month-old female rats treated with 17-\u03b2-estradiol, and 3-month-old untreated male and female rats. The results indicated hypercholesterolemic status and a significant increase of HMGR activity according to a reduced activation of AMPK detected in treated rats compared to controls. Furthermore, 17-\u03b2 estradiol treatment reduced HMGR activity restoring AMPK activation. These findings highlight the correlation between estrogen and HMGR short-term regulation, and suggest the presence of another mechanism underlying the protective role of estrogen in age-related diseases.",

Therefore we compared the effects of a 3\u00a0months lasting oral administration of estradiol 17\u03b2 (E2) with those of the phytoestrogens equol, genistein and puerarin. They were ovariectomized, fed with test substance containing food and then anaesthetized and catheterized with a biluminal catheter having one outlet in the bladder and another in the urethra at the level of the urethral sphincter.

We investigated the effect of age on autophagy and apoptosis in plantaris muscle of male Fischer 344 rats that were either fed ad libitum, or mild, life-long calorie restricted (CR) alone or combined with life-long voluntary exercise. Upstream autophagy-regulatory proteins were either upregulated with age (Beclin-1) or unchanged (Atg7 and 9). LC3 gene and protein expression pattern as well as LAMP-2 gene expression, both downstream regulators of autophagy, however, suggested an age-related decline in autophagic degradation. Atg protein expression and LC3 and LAMP-2 gene expression were improved in CR rats with or without exercise. The age-related increase in oxidative damage and apoptosis were attenuated by the treatments. Both, oxidative damage and apoptosis correlated negatively with autophagy.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that apolipoprotein E (apoE) has a major impact on longevity, but its mechanisms are still not fully understood. ApoE-deficient (Eo) mice have proved to be a very popular model for studying spontaneous hypercholesterolemia and the subsequent development of atherosclerotic lesions, but only limited data are available with regard to aging and aging changes. We used this murine model to better characterize the involvement of apoE in aging and to evaluate its role in the maintenance of normal organ morphology. Our results show that E0 mice at different ages (6, 12, 20\u00a0weeks old) developed age-dependent morphological and biochemical alterations, including fibrosis (newly formed collagen), pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and iNOS), lipofuscin accumulation, and decrease of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) in several organs (kidney, liver and heart). It is significant that the observed degenerative findings in E0 mice at different ages (6, 12, 20\u00a0weeks old) were not identified in control mice (C57BL), at 6, 12 and 20\u00a0weeks of age. Consequently, since these mice showed enzymatic and structural alterations, normally linked to the age, such as increase of lipofuscin, pro-inflammatory cytokines and decrease of antioxidant enzymes, we can conclude that apoE is a useful player in studies of longevity and age-related diseases, such as inflammatory status and atherosclerosis that are known risk factors for functional decline and early mortality. Moreover, it is possible that apoE may also play a role in other pathological conditions including, for example, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and macular degeneration.",

Plasmacytoid DC from aged mice had similar IFN\u03b1 production upon CpG stimulation compared to young mice, and the ability of splenic DC to stimulate T cells was not affected by age.

Reduced splenic DC activation in aged mice was not due to altered TLR4 expression, but was associated with reduced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 proteins.

Core CSF biomarkers include secreted A\u03b2 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) isoforms, A\u03b2 oligomers and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). This article reviews recent research advances on CSF and plasma A\u03b2-related biomarkers for AD and how they may reflect pathogenic changes in AD-affected neuronal networks. We also consider their usefulness in clinical practice and in clinical trials.",

Immunoassays were developed detecting total (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated at specific epitopes (p-tauX) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), methods to analyse tau in blood are at the experimental beginning. Clinical research consistently demonstrated CSF t- and p-tau increased in AD compared to controls. Measuring these tau species proved informative for classifying AD from relevant differential diagnoses. Tau phosphorylated at threonine 231 (p-tau231) differentiated between AD and frontotemporal dementia, tau phosphorylated at serine 181 (p-tau181) enhanced classification between AD and dementia with Lewy bodies. T- and p-tau are considered \u201ccore\u201d AD biomarkers that have been successfully validated by controlled large-scale multi-center studies. Tau biomarkers are implemented in clinical trials to reflect biological activity, mechanisms of action of compounds, support enrichment of target populations, provide endpoints for proof-of-concept and confirmatory trials on disease modification. World-wide quality control initiatives are underway to set required methodological and protocol standards. Discussions with regulatory authorities gain momentum defining the role of tau biomarkers for trial designs and how they may be further qualified for surrogate marker status.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a severe chronic neurodegenerative disorder of the brain. A probable diagnosis of AD can be obtained by cerebrospinal fluid levels of 3 biomarkers: beta-amyloid (1\u201342), total tau and phospho-tau181. Researchers are interested in finding additional biomarkers in CSF to improve the specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis, including also other forms of dementia, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition, less invasive diagnostic methods using blood or blood-derived cells are being investigated. This mini-review (in concert with the other reviews of this special issue) summarizes the usefulness of growth factors and cytokines/chemokines as putative surrogate biomarkers for diagnosing AD and MCI in CSF and blood. Briefly, the expression levels of growth factors and cytokines/chemokines are very heterogenous, indicating the pathological diversity of these diseases. At present, no single growth factor or cytokine alone stands out as a useful biomarker for diagnosing AD or MCI. However, the combined \u201cpatients profile signature\u201d of several selected growth factors and/or cytokines/chemokines may allow to diagnose AD and MCI with higher selectively and specificity.",

     "abstract": "With an ever growing population of aged individuals who are at risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD), there is an urgent need for a sensitive, specific, and preferably non-invasive diagnostic standard of disease progression. Mainstream thinking suggests that early intervention is key to maximizing the opportunity for a successful treatment regimen in AD and, as such, an early and accurate means of diagnosis is essential. In this study, we applied a recently described antibody\u2013antigen dissociation technique to samples obtained as part of a population-based analysis of the prevalence of AD. Stratified sampling and random selection strategies were combined to obtain a representative population for screening of individuals older than 55\u00a0years. Serum antibodies to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)1\u201342 were measured before and after antigen dissociation. The difference between the two measurements was indicated as the dissociation delta (\u0394). Our analyses showed that the levels of dissociated antibody in AD patients were always significantly different from controls and that levels of A\u03b2 antibody after dissociation, but not those of non-dissociated antibody, correlated negatively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with both duration of the disease and age in the AD patients. Moreover, the change in concentration of A\u03b2 antibody from pre- to post-dissociation (i.e., the dissociation \u0394) directly reflected the progression of AD in terms of both time since diagnosis and age of the patients, with a lower dissociation \u0394 indicating a more advanced stage of AD. Ultimately, these data suggest that dissociated A\u03b2 antibody levels are of significant diagnostic value at the onset of the neurodegenerative process and, thereafter, may be a useful biomarker for disease progression.",

APP is the key player in AD pathogenesis, and platelets contain all the enzymatic machinery to its processing, thus being the ideal candidate where to study AD pathogenetic mechanisms.In this review, we summarise the published data regarding the usefulness of platelet APP form ratio in the diagnosis of early AD. Approaches combining APP form ratio along with neuroimaging markers show the promise to accurately identify AD, even in the pre-symptomatic stage.",

     "abstract": "The ultimate goal of diagnostic research is a blood test detecting the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) before neuronal damage develops. Current amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) tests do not detect the process leading to neurodegeneration. Novel immunologic and proteomics tests are based on aberrant appearance of inflammatory cytokines in the CSF and other protein biomarkers in the CSF or blood, and immune biomarkers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC\u2019s). Cytokines, chemokines, complement factors, serum amyloid P component, and signaling proteins in the CSF or blood may be a rich source of diagnostic biomarkers, but the power of these tests will need to be examined in prospective studies. Recently-described flow cytometric test of defective A\u03b2 phagocytosis detects patients with AD with a high sensitivity and specificity in distinct populations (confirmed AD patients vs. active University professors), but further experience is necessary for its use in general population at risk of AD. The analysis of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells \u201cstressed\u201d by A\u03b2 is beginning to unravel the relations between specific pathways and AD. Thus novel diagnostic tests may provide biomarkers for pre-clinical detection, clarification of progression from MCI to AD, and follow-up of patients in clinical trials of immunostimulating therapies.",

The alteration of PKC activity stimulates amyloid-beta peptides production and protein tau hyperphosphorylation. This recently led to consider PKC as a potential therapeutic target for disease modifying drugs. Moreover PKC alterations were also observed in peripheral cells including blood cells. This short review recalls the main findings on the role of PKC in the disease process and focuses on its use as an AD biomarker in blood cells. Using fluorescent probes specific for PKC, it is possible to detect the conformational changes of the enzyme in living cells. Such probes can be used to detect PKC alterations in red blood cells and thus to distinguish AD patients from healthy controls with unmatched specificity and sensitivity.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic neuropathological features that are accompanied by inflammatory processes and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. There is evidence that microglial cells are a key mediator of damage in AD. The microglial compartment may arise to a greater part from activation and transmigration of circulating monocytes. The aim of the present pilot study was to explore, if different cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and -3, PECAM-1, VCAM-1, P-, L- and E-selectins, E-cadherin), RAGE and CD14 are affected in monocytes of healthy subjects compared to patients suffering from AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Monocytes were isolated by negative magnetic selection (MACS) from EDTA blood samples, and extracts were analyzed by Searchlight Multiplex ELISAs. When compared to healthy subjects, the ratio of monocytic ICAM-3/CD14 was significantly decreased in MCI and AD patients and the ratio of the monocytic P-selectin/CD14 was specifically decreased in AD patients. In conclusion, our data show that monocytic cell adhesion molecules are decreased in AD and MCI patients. Further larger longitudinal studies should then clarify whether any of these parameters may be useful as a diagnostic biomarker.",

     "abstract": "Sporadic Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a genetically complex and chronically progressive neurodegenerative disorder with molecular mechanisms and neuropathologies centering around the amyloidogenic pathway, hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau protein, and neurofibrillary degeneration. While cerebrovascular changes have not been traditionally considered to be a central part of AD pathology, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that they may, in fact, be a characteristic feature of the AD brain as well. In particular, microvascular abnormalities within the brain have been associated with pathological AD hallmarks and may precede neurodegeneration. In vivo assessment of microvascular pathology provides a promising approach to develop useful biological markers for early detection and pathological characterization of AD. This review focuses on established blood-based biological marker candidates of microvascular pathology in AD. These candidates include plasma concentration of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) that are increased in AD. Measures of endothelial vasodilatory function including endothelin (ET-1), adrenomedullin (ADM), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), as well as sphingolipids are significantly altered in mild AD or during the predementia stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), suggesting sensitivity of these biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis. In conclusion, the emerging clinical diagnostic evidence for the value of blood-based microvascular biomarkers in AD is promising, however, still requires validation in phase II and III diagnostic trials. Moreover, it is still unclear whether the described protein dysbalances are early or downstream pathological events and how the detected systemic microvascular alterations relate to cerebrovascular and neuronal pathologies in the AD brain.",
