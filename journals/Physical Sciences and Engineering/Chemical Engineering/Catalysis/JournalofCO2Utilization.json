     "abstract": "Wollastonite (CaSiO3) is considered as one of the most suitable naturally occurring minerals for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration because of its high Calcium (Ca) content, which has an enormous potential to form stable carbonates. However, carbonation of CaSiO3 is a complex three\u2013phase reaction involving CaSiO3, an aqueous solution, and gaseous CO2. The reaction mechanism gets complicated further due to the formation of undissolved silica and product layers on the surface of CaSiO3 particles. The formation of these layers is caused by incongruent dissolution of CaSiO3 and precipitation of the carbonate occurring simultaneously. In this study, a mathematical model was developed to understand the mechanism of dissolution and precipitation of the mineral components. The model functioned under various temperatures, pressures, S/L ratios and particle size fractions. The model was then validated using experimental data obtained by conducting experiments on the carbonation of CaSiO3. It utilized the experimental results to eventually calculate the Damkohler number (Da) to understand the rate controlling mechanism of the reaction.",

     "abstract": "Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to a hydrocarbon fuel can reduce greenhouse emissions and lead to economic profits. Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are potential candidates for decreasing CO2 emission due to their low electrical energy consumption properties for CO2 reduction. However, their fuel electrode, which is nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ), shows critical durability issues. This study aimed to find an SOEC fuel electrode material among perovskite catalysts. The selected catalysts should satisfy the following properties: high catalytic performance in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, low carbon deposition rate after the RWGS reaction, high electrical conductivity, and long-term durability in a co-electrolysis environment. Ni-YSZ and perovskite catalysts were fabricated. Their performance was investigated by considering the four properties. In this study, we found La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O\u03b4-3 (LSCM) to be a promising SOEC fuel electrode. The LSCM electrode showed comparably good catalytic performance and electrical conductivity. A 1,200\u2009h co-electrolysis test showed that the electrode had a stable performance.",

In this report, a series of CuO/ZnO photocatalysts were developed by varying the Cu contents. The developed photocatalysts provided solar driven CO2 reduction efficiencies comparable to those obtained for water splitting in similar devices without using reductant and Pt as co-catalyst.

The triacylglycerols (TAGs) composition of the a\u00e7ai oil samples were predicted based on the fatty acid profile. The main TAGs predicted, representing more than 85% of the total composition, are OOO, POO, OLiO, PLiO and POP. The solubility values of a\u00e7a\u00ed oil predicted applying the Peng-Robinson equation of state at the same operating conditions of global yield experiments showed the same behavior of the global yields that increases as pressure and temperature increases.

In this review, we emphasize the recent progress in the pyrolysis of waste feedstocks in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2-assisted pyrolysis is compared to typical pyrolysis (i.e., pyrolysis under inert environment, such as nitrogen). It has been shown that CO2 plays a crucial role in increasing the yield of combustible permanent gas (e.g., carbon monoxide) while decreasing tar yield. CO2-assisted pyrolysis is also an attractive technique to treat waste (municipal solid waste, plastic waste, etc.) because CO2 enhances the thermal cracking of volatile species, thereby suppressing the formation of harmful chemical compounds, such as benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition to highlighting the recent achievements in the CO2-assisted pyrolysis processes, we discuss the points that should be considered for future research.",

     "abstract": "In this paper X2PCC (Calcium containing material X to Precipitated Calcium Carbonate) process wherein a steelmaking slag is used as a source of Ca for mineral carbonation of CO2 was studied. Mineral carbonation refers to binding of CO2 into mineral carbonates, here CaCO3. In the process, we first dissolve Ca selectively from the slag, then separate the solid phase and finally, bubble CO2 into the solution to make precipitated calcium carbonate CaCO3. Based on our current understanding, the extraction step limits the process feasibility. In the experiments, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) water solution was used as an extracting solvent with varying concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1 and 2\u2009mol/L using slag to solvent ratio of 100\u2009g/L. The main objective of this study was to determine the optimal concentrations of solvent and particle size for leaching out calcium from the slag. Tests were performed at room temperature with varying particle size and solvent concentration. The extraction behaviors of different size fractions of the slag, 0\u201350\u2009\u03bcm, 50\u201374\u2009\u03bcm and 74\u2013125\u2009\u03bcm were studied. Dissolution results showed that with high solvent concentrations calcium extraction efficiency increases but at the same time, other elements are leached, such as vanadium, silicon and magnesium that act as impurities in the subsequent carbonation stage. It was found that with the largest particles, Ca extraction becomes limited by mass transfer and the availability of Ca from the particle. Our hypothesis is that the surface layer of the particles gets blocked by reaction products and stops the reaction. With the smallest particle size, before the surface gets blocked, more calcium could be extracted and the maximum extraction efficiency was not reached.",

     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "The fabrication and hydroxylation of surface defects on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are performed through a single or combined method involving hydrothermal, ultrasonic and ball-milling treatments. These treatments cannot change the tubular morphology of the graphite structure in MWCNTs but they can alter the surface defect structure on MWCNTs. Surface defects on MWCNTs can promote the hydroxylation of the MWCNTs to produce hydroxyl groups. However, these defects are difficult to hydroxylate when occupied by other functional groups, such as carboxyl groups, even though the hydroxylation processes are the same. After hydroxylation, the MWCNTs with surface defects can be employed as metal-free catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using CO2 as soft oxidants. The inherent disorder or artificial skeleton defects on MWCNTs cannot directly act as catalytic active sites, but they can be hydroxylated to enhance the catalytic activity of the MWCNTs. For the same type of MWCNT defects formed after hydroxylation, the catalytic activity is closely related to the defect density. If the disorder or skeleton defects cause a higher defect density on the hydroxylated MWCNTs, the MWCNTs will exhibit a higher catalytic activity. Due to the different structures and positions of the MWCNT defect carbons, the artificial skeleton defects on MWCNTs more efficiently promote the hydroxylation of MWCNTs compared to the disorder defects, decreasing their defect density and enhancing their catalytic activity. Therefore, MWCNTs-BOH36 with skeleton defects has a catalytic activity that is twice as high as that of MWCNTs-CS-120 with disorder defects.",

     "abstract": "Coupling Chemical Looping Reforming of methane with CO2-splitting reactions represents an attractive route to achieve continuous syngas and CO productivities with reduced carbon footprint in a cyclic two-steps process. Both reactions are performed in the presence of a metal oxide, which switches from reduced to oxidized in successive stages. In this work, La1-xSrxFeO3 perovskites were selected, because the Sr/La ratio can be varied to tune the redox capacity of the system. Reactivity of these materials were tested in isothermal cycles at 850\u2009\u00b0C with the aim of simultaneously maximize the conversion of CH4 and ensure the re-oxidation of the solid. Although the highest redox capacity is observed for the material with higher Sr-content (x\u2009=\u20090.9), the best performance is obtained for La0.9Sr0.1FeO3, which exhibits notable overall syngas yields per cycle: 12.8\u2009mmol H2\u2009g\u22121 and 15.9\u2009mmol CO g\u22121. Analyses of the reactivity of these perovskites reveal the important contribution of both methane cracking and Boudouard reaction on the production of syngas, particularly for materials with low Sr/La ratio. These two processes operate, respectively, in the reduction and oxidation stages, in such a way that a significant deactivation of the perovskites by carbon deposition is avoided. These findings highlight the influence of aspects other than redox properties on the high temperature reactivity of La1-xSrxFeO3 perovskites in cycles alternating CH4 and CO2. On the other hand, materials with high La/Sr ratio experienced significant changes in the phase composition after prolonged reduction in CH4. Nevertheless, these transformations are reversible and, after re-oxidation, the recovered perovskite remains highly active, emphasizing the stability of these reactive solids.",

Box and whisker plots were applied (as a part of exploratory data analysis) to determine how various input variables influence the performance variables. Moreover, decision tree classification was used to determine the relative significance of the input variables and the possible combinations of these variables leading to high performance (to deduce heuristics for high CO2 uptake). It was found from the exploratory data analysis that amine density was the most significant variable affecting the adsorption capacity whereas remaining pore volume and adsorption temperature were the most influential variables in case of amine efficiency. Furthermore, various combinations of input variables leading to high CO2 capture performance were revealed through the decision tree analysis, all of which may be used as guidelines for future studies in this area.",

[C2mim][acac] chemically absorbed CO2 as well as [C2mim][AcO] at atmospheric pressure, although the CO2 solubility of the former was lower than the latter. On the other hand, [C2mim][Tf2N], [C2mim][TFA], [C2mim][tfacac], and [C2mim][hfacac] absorbed only a negligible amount of CO2 under the same conditions. The smaller chemisorption of [C2mim][acac] is attributable to the weaker interactions of the H2c atom with the oxygen atoms of [acac]\u2013. The stronger interaction between the cation and anion in the ionic liquids allows to draw the H2c atom at the initial stage of CO2 chemisorption.",

Different characterization techniques were used to analyze the chemical structure and surface functional groups of the adsorbents. The adsorption behavior of CO2 on the adsorbent was evaluated in a fixed-bed adsorption system equipped with gas chromatography. It was found that a high temperature had a negative impact on CO2 adsorption due to the CO2/amine groups reaction was exothermic. The existence of water had a growth-promoting effect on CO2 adsorption capacity because of its improvement of the amine utilization efficiency. Highest adsorption amount of 3.15\u2009mmol/g for PNIPAAm@PEIs was obtained at 10\u2009\u00b0C under wet condition. Moreover, the CO2 adsorption (25\u2009\u00b0C) and desorption (60 \u00b0C) behavior showed that PNIPAAm@PEIs could desorb CO2 more efficiently at 60 \u00b0C than that of polyethyleneimine sphere (PEIs) due to the temperature-responsive property of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). This study revealed that introduction of thermosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) into solid amine could effectively reduce the energy consumption when regeneration of adsorbents.",

The regular spherical pores of 14\u201315\u2009nm diameter with a large pore volume of 3.4 cm3\u2009g\u22121 provided a very high CO2 adsorption capacity exceeding the compared carbon materials at high gas pressures (\u22654\u2009MPa and room temperature).

DFM is composed of a catalytic metal intimately in contact with alkaline metal oxides supported on high surface area carriers. The catalyst is required to methanate the adsorbed CO2 after the capture step is carried out in an O2-and steam-containing flue gas. Ruthenium, Rhodium and Nickel are known CO2 methanation catalysts provided they are in the reduced state. Ni is a preferred methanation catalyst based on price and activity, however, its inability to be reduced to its active state during the DFM process (capture and hydrogenation at 320\u2009\u00b0C) was compared with Ru and Rh as methanation candidates. The performance of a variety of alkaline adsorbents was also studied and the strengths and weaknesses of candidate catalysts and adsorbents were evaluated. All samples were tested in a fixed bed reactor to quantify the extent and rate of methane generation.Complementing fixed bed testing, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to evaluate the extent of CO2 adsorption and rate of catalytic methanation. Pre-reduced (at 650\u2009\u00b0C) Ni-containing DFM is highly active for CO2 methanation. However, the hydrogenation with 15% H2/N2 is completely inactive after exposure to O2 and steam, in a flue gas simulation, during the CO2 capture step at 320\u2009\u00b0C. Rh and Ru DFMs were effective methanation catalysts with Ru being superior based on capture capacity, hydrogenation rate and price. In contrast to Ni \u2013 containing DFM, Ru remained active towards methanation even after exposure to flue gas simulation. Alkaline adsorbents (\u201cNa2O\u201d, CaO, \u201cK2O\u201d and MgO) in combination with reduced Ru were tested for adsorption and methanation. Ru \u2013 \u201cNa2O\u201d/Al2O3 DFMs showed the highest rates for methanation although CaO is also a reasonable candidate.

The objective of this study is to develop the nanoemulsion absorbents that can be operated at room temperature. The nanoemulsion absorbents are prepared by the ultrasonication method. Based on the chemical properties, Span 60 and Tween 60 are added to maintain a good dispersion stability. CO2 absorption experiments using a porous nozzle absorber are conducted for various dodecane concentration (0.005\u20130.5\u2009vol%) and CO2 flow rate (0.06\u20130.12\u2009g/s). It is found that the CO2 absorption performance of 0.05\u2009vol% nanoemulsion absorbents is 10% higher than that of pure methanol. Through the single CO2 bubble absorption visualization experiments, it is confirmed that the nanoemulsion absorbents cause faster bubble absorption than pure methanol does. The turbidity index (Nephelometry turbidity unit) of nanoemulsion absorbents is kept constant for seven days, which means a good dispersion stability. The enhancement mechanism of CO2 absorption is explained based on the Einstein-Stokes\u2019 equation, cryogenic transmission electron images, and droplet size measurements. The key idea is that nano-sized dodecane (64\u2009nm) absorbs the CO2 molecules and transports it to the bulk region by the Brownian diffusion. A random walk model is used to investigate the droplet size prediction and CO2 absorption performance enhancement.",

Up to date, the reported CO2-responsive materials are mainly referred to switchable-hydrophilicity solvents, switchable surfactants, switchable water additives, switchable ionic liquids and CO2-responsive polymers. These CO2-responsive materials can be switched by CO2 trigger at moderate conditions, showing switchable properties, such as hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity conversion, switching \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d surface-activity and switchable change in ionic strength. These switchable properties can be applied in separations, especially in oil-solid separation, oil-water separation, wastewater treatment and acid gas capture. In this review, the recent advances of CO2-responsive materials in separation fields above have been overviewed. Additionally, the present challenges and future engineering considerations have been touched to provide potential insights and theoretical fundamentals for developing CO2-responsive materials.",

Three feedstocks (goat excreta, rice straw, and corncob) were compared to verify whether goat excreta is a promising feedstock of furfural. The furfural concentration from goat excreta (3.2\u2009g L\u22121) via acid-catalyzed dehydration was comparable to that from rice straw or corncob. To maximize energy recovery from goat excreta via pyrolysis, CO2 was employed as a reactive medium (compared with typical pyrolysis with N2). This study experimentally proved that CO2 plays a pivotal role in shifting carbon distribution from pyrolytic oil to pyrolytic gas, thereby enhancing the generation of CO (the main component of pyrolytic gas). Based on the experimental results, it is suggested that goat excreta can be a promising initial feedstock for the production of furfural and energy recovery.",

The dissolution rate of magnesium ions (Mg2+) from thermally activated serpentine and the factors influencing the rate and extent of dissolution have been studied in our research group. The current contribution focuses on the effect of temperature and pH on the dissolution of heat activated lizardite (a polymorph of serpentine).

Today, more than 30\u2009Gt of CO2 is emitted each year, with an increasing tendency. Of this, the main share results from the burning of fossil fuels; only a small fraction derives from renewable fuels. In this study the renewable sources of CO2 are examined in terms of their current, near-term (2030) and long-term (2050) potential. Current and potential future market output is based on a literature review concerning the future energy market and policy frameworks. As a reference for the utilization of CO2, three promising fuel options (methanol, methane and future Fischer-Tropsch fuels) are investigated. Along with the production capacities, H2 demand for the conversion was calculated on the basis of chemical process simulations. One aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the expected range of CO2 recycling from non-fossil sources. It was found that quantities of non-fossil CO2 lie far behind fossil CO2 quantities (6.8% of fossil CO2 provision in 2015). However, with rising demand for CO2-based products and a concurrent decrease in the amount and willingness to use fossil CO2, in the future non-fossil CO2 will grow in importance (reaching up to 23% of fossil CO2 provision in 2050). The study shows that CO2 from non-fossil sources is a reliable and available source of carbon.",

It uses existing facilities and on-going breakthrough technological advancements from CO2 transportation to H2O/CO2 solar co-splitting for syngas formation to further conversion to either methanol or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) products. A full scale simulation of the overall chemical process is established, considering its subsections with respect to all relevant cost elements and operating expenses using appropriate cost correlations. Eight spanning routes of the CO2 superstructure are assessed for a real case of transporting compressed pure or mixtures of CO2 with a 130\u2009kg/s capacity over a distance of 120\u2009km from a power plant in Ptolemaida, Greece, operating with either natural gas or coal, and combining with water from an existing wastewater treatment facility in Thessaloniki, Greece.

The results confirmed that no toxins were present in the water used; in addition, we confirmed that fertilizers could be utilised as the nutrient source instead of pure chemicals. Secondly, the strains were evaluated in terms of growth rate, biomass productivity and photosynthetic efficiency concluding that Scenedesmus almeriensis, Neochloris oleoabundans and bloom from the River Seine were the most productive, above 1.0\u2009g\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7day\u22121. Thirdly, we determined the biochemical composition of the biomass with the results showing that most of the strains mainly accumulate carbohydrates in the stationary phase, over 60% d.wt.; the exceptions were Neochloris oleoabundans and Chlorella vulgaris, which accumulate lipids, above 20% d.wt. In any case, the performance of the microalgae strains was better than that of cyanobacteria both in terms of biomass productivity and the biochemical composition; consequently, using these types of microorganisms is recommended. By considering a fixed value for the main biomass components, we concluded that the most promising strains were Scenedesmus almeriensis, Neochloris oleoabundans and bloom from the River Seine, yielding a biomass value above 0.6 \u20ac\u00b7kg\u22121 and an economic value higher than 0.7 \u20ac\u00b7m-3\u00b7day\u22121.

Moreover, using microalgae for atmospheric CO2 mitigation to combat climate change is promising as waste sources and atmospheric CO2 can be utilized to produce useful products. The challenge is developing technologies, processes, and strategies that utilize carbon efficiently such that the overall system is sustainable. Through engineering system modeling combined with techno-economic and life-cycle assessments, this study examined the implications of various delivery methods of carbon to a production-scale algal biorefinery. Five primary carbon sources were considered: atmospheric CO2; CO2 from direct chemical or power plant waste emissions; CO2 that has been concentrated from waste sources and compressed; inorganic carbon in the form of hydrogen carbonate; and organic carbon in the form of cellulosic sugars derived from corn stover. Each source was evaluated assuming co-location as well as pipeline transportation up to 100\u202fkm. Sustainability results indicate that economics are more prohibitive than energy and emissions. Of the scenarios evaluated, only two met both the economic and environmental criteria of contributing less than 0.50\u202fUS-$\u202fGGE\u22121 and 20\u202fg\u202fCO2-eq\u202fMJ\u22121 to the overall system, respectively: uncompressed, pure sources of gaseous CO2 with pipeline transportation of 40\u202fkm or less; and compressed, supercritical CO2 from pure sources for pipeline transportation up to 100\u202fkm.

A high concentration of NaHCO3 (source of CO2) is utilized to promote H2 generation from olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4) hydration, and then CO2 is reduced to formic acid (HCOOH) or sequestrated in magnesite (MgCO3) in a hydrothermal system. The effects of NaHCO3 concentration (0\u20131.0\u2009mol/L) and initial pH (8\u201311) on H2 production and CO2 storage were experimentally lab-scale tested at 300\u2009\u00b0C. Both reaction pathways and reaction rates changed with variation of the reaction conditions. Under CO2-rich conditions, olivine consumption was promoted with the absence of Fe(II)-bearing brucite (Mg,Fe(OH)2), by which more Mg and Fe ions were released. Thus, the production of H2 and carbonation processes were significantly accelerated. The highest H2 generation rate reached 3.13\u2009mmol/kgolivine\u00b7h, which is more than 15 times higher than previously reported. The HCOOH yield was 129.1\u2009mmol/kgolivine and magnesite ((Mg,Fe)CO3) generation reached a maximum of 19.2\u2009wt% in 72\u2009h. The enhancement of H2 production at lower pH is primarily attributed to the presence of HCO3\u2212, rather than the pH changes caused by NaHCO3 addition. The system proposed here has significant potential to be applied at the field-scale.",

Faradaic efficiency (FE) of carbonaceous products in GDE cell was more than 3-folds higher than the 2C cell due to improved CO2 mass transfer. From the investigation of alkaline catholyte in GDE cell, the higher catholyte alkalinity led to higher current density and higher FE of carbonaceous products with a better selectivity of C2 (ethanol and ethylene). The reason lies in the OH groups around catalyst surface which improve the reaction kinetics and moreover stabilize the catalyst surface oxygen during the reduction process.

Such assessment is necessary in the light of practical applications of adsorbents in numerous adsorption-desorption cycles in a large-scale DR-VPSA adsorption unit. This is due to the fact that the useful life of an adsorbent has an effect of its costs and, as a consequence, the viability of the adsorption plant and its advantage over the absorption method of CO2 capture using amine solutions. The assessment of the stability and regenerability of adsorbents was based on the analysis of activated carbon derived from a pilot DR-VPSA unit operating on real combustion gas for a period of 808\u2009h. The pilot plant was set up under the Strategic Project in Tauron Wytwarzanie S.A. \u2013 The \u0141agisza Power Plant in Poland. The stability of activated carbon was determined by performing the full analysis of the physicochemical properties on a samples taken from the adsorption column after many working cycles in the DR-VPSA plant under real flue gas conditions. The regenerability of activated carbon was verified by assessing their sorption capacity prior to, and after prolonged use in numerous adsorption-desorption cycles in the DR-VPSA plant. The obtained information provide new knowledge of the CO2 adsorption behaviour of the activated carbon in response to flue gas exposure in pilot DR-VPSA adsorption units.",

     "abstract": "This paper mainly focuses the effect of high incorporation ratios of fly ash (FA) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) on the carbonation resistance of concrete. The aim of using high volumes of these non-traditional materials is to decrease the use of natural resources and capture CO2. For that purpose, the carbonation resistance of low- and high-strength concrete mixes produced with various incorporation ratios of FA, fine RCA and coarse RCA, jointly and individually, is obtained and related with compressive strength, water absorption and chloride ion penetration. The results show that the carbonation depth of concrete increased up to 3 and 6 times when incorporating 30% and 60% of FA, respectively, and 100% of RCA led to up to 2.7 times increment. Therefore, the concrete cover for mixes made with FA and/or RCA should be increased in order to obtain an equivalent service life to that of conventional concrete. In spite of this fact, it is recommended to incorporate FA in RCA concrete because, in most concrete mixes, the carbonation depth due to the combined effect of both RCA and FA was lower than the sum of the values due to each effect. Additionally, the results show that, although the carbonation rate of concrete mixes containing high volumes of FA and RCA is high, their service life is also relatively high and the concrete reinforcement can be protected for up to 50 years.",

CO2 had an effect on reducing the process efficiency as well as pH and EC in the SSL-derived biochars. Changes in the elemental composition (H and O content) were also noted after change of carrier gases. In the biochars obtained in a CO2, a negative correlation was found between EC and pyrolysis temperature. In the biochars produced from SSL and willow, apart from similar changes to those observed for the biochars made from SSL in the presence of CO2, changes in the surface properties were additionally noted.

CO2 which is known as a greenhouse gas has thermodynamically turned into stable CaCO3 after having been used for leaching of boric acid (H3BO3). Optimization of dissolution of colemanite obtianed from Bursa Kestelek under CO2 pressure has been investigated by using Taguchi Method. The parameters and their ranges used in the experiments were chosen as in the following: solid-to-liquid ratio (0.24\u20130.171\u2009g/ml), gas pressure (15\u201330\u2009bar), temperature (80\u2013140\u2009\u00b0C), time (90\u2013150\u2009min) and particle size (0.250-0.125\u2009mm).

The derived boric acid product has been characterized through the use of XRD, XPS, SEM, TGA and BET instruments. Dissolution rate under optimum conditions has been found to be 95.33%.

     "abstract": "The stability of Fe2O3-MgAl2O4 oxygen storage materials (OSMs) was investigated over 1000 redox cycles using H2 as reductant and CO2 as oxidant. Three different materials, with a nominal Fe2O3 amount of 10\u2009wt%, 30\u2009wt% and 50\u2009wt%, were evaluated. Characterization techniques such as N2 adsorption, XRD and STEM-EDX were applied to study the evolution of morphological and crystallographic properties. XRD results show that Fe is incorporated in the MgAl2O4 lattice of the as prepared materials, yielding a Mg-Fe-Al-O spinel structure. After redox cycling, part of Fe still remains within the spinel. The results of redox cycling reveal superior properties for 10Fe2O3-MgAl2O4, exhibiting stability in terms of morphology and, with an average space-time yield of 700 mmolCO s\u22121 kgFe\u22121, the highest activity among the OSMs studied. However, 50Fe2O3-MgAl2O4 performs best in terms of overall CO yield, i.e. 0.6\u2009mol CO kgOSM\u22121, more than twofold higher compared to 10Fe2O3-MgAl2O4 and 30Fe2O3-MgAl2O4 even after 1000 cycles. Deactivation through sintering occurs in all three materials, though to a lesser extent for 10Fe2O3-MgAl2O4.

The free ion concentration was also studied to compare the enzymatic activity and changes in electrical conductivity. Additionally both enzymes, untreated or treated using either Sc-CO2 or HPP, were used as additives in the CuCl2 crystallization method. The resulting additive-specific CuCl2 patterns were characterized based on different structural features. Sc-CO2 was found to have a significant influence on PPO and POD activities, and an increased reduction in the residual activity of both enzymes was observed when the Sc-CO2 pressure was increased. However, PPO was more resistant to temperature and pressure than POD. The D-value calculated for POD was in the range of 38.3 and 592.0\u2009min, and 60.6 and 291.5\u2009min, for HPP and Sc-CO2 treatments, respectively; whereas for PPO varied from 103.1 to 284.3\u2009min under HPP and from 83.4 to 303.0\u2009min using the Sc-CO2 treatment. It can be concluded that the application of Sc-CO2 could be an effective tool for inactivating PPO and POD enzymes.

From characterization results, CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 nanoparticles were formed and were uniformly dispersed and attached to the surface of LDH. BET surface area and copper dispersion of the catalysts were significantly improved by 4.3 times and 2.9 times, respectively, compared with a reference catalyst without the support. In a catalytic reaction, the catalyst showed dramatic methanol selectivity of 78.3% at 523 K and 3.0 MPa, which is 14.4% higher than the commercial catalyst measured in this investigation and about 50% higher than conventional copper-based catalysts in literatures. It also showed over twice the space time yield based on active metal sites compared to a commercial catalyst in the temperature range 473\u2009K\u2013573\u2009K.

This necessitates the development of new pathways for its utilization as a means of diverting it from landfills where it poses a significant threat to the environment. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage presents opportunities to utilize fly ash in various ways; as a capture material, as a medium for permanent CO2 storage via mineralization, and as a catalyst or catalyst support for CO2 utilization processes.

In the present study, in-situ CO2 gasification of direct-coal fueled CLC experiments are conducted using a fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure in a batch-wise mode of operation. The low cost metal oxide, Fe2O3, is used as the oxygen carrier particles for the CLC of a low ash based North East Indian coal. Pyrolysis and CO2 gasification experiments are performed with and without the presence of metal oxides for estimating the CO2 yield. The results show that the CO2 yield is increased from 17.5% (without metal oxides) to 88.7% (with metal oxides) under the N2 atmosphere. A highest CO2 yield of 96% is observed under in-situ CO2 gasification incorporated CLC conditions. Further, thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) is conducted to study the conversion and instantaneous reactivity between the coal and metal oxides. It is estimated that 83% conversion of the coal-Fe2O3 mixture is attained under the CO2 atmosphere, while it is 57% in the N2 atmosphere. The kinetic parameters are estimated using the TGA data for the reaction between coal and metal oxide under N2 and CO2 atmosphere using reaction order models. It is found that the first and third order models show the best fit for the non-CLC and CLC process, respectively.",

The experimental results indicate that the Venturi tube had a strong effect on the reaction time and properties of PCC particles. The use of a Venturi tube resulted in a decrease in the time required for producing PCC particles, which were smooth, well-crystallized, and nano-sized cubic crystals. However, when no Venturi tube was used, hollow spherical crystals formed along with cubic crystals.

Cyclic carbonates from limonene are bio-renewable monomers for the production of fully bio-based polymers from citrus waste; however, there are currently very few reports on their synthesis. This work reports the synthesis of five-membered cyclic carbonates from bio-based limonene oxide (LO) and CO2 catalysed by commercially available inexpensive, tetrabutylammonium halides (TBAX). The cycloaddition of CO2 with commercial LO mixture of cis/trans-isomers (40:60) is highly stereoselective and the trans-isomer exhibits considerably higher conversion than the cis-isomer. Therefore, a stereoselective method of (R)-(+)-limonene epoxidation was performed to achieve a significantly higher yield of the trans-isomer (87 \u00b1 2%) than cis-isomer, which leads to high conversion and yield to the corresponding cyclic carbonates. The catalytic effect of halide anions (X\u00af) and the influence of operational reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst amount were studied. High conversion (87%) was obtained after 20 h at 120 \u00b0C, 40\u2009bar CO2 using 6 mol% tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) catalyst. A detailed study of the reaction kinetics revealed the reaction to be first-order in epoxide (LO), CO2 and catalyst (TBAC) concentrations. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the reaction was studied using Arrhenius and Eyring equations. The activation energy (Ea) of the reaction was calculated to be 64 kJ mol\u20131. The high positive value of Gibbs free energy (\u0394G\u2021 = 102.6 kJ mol\u20131) and negative value of activation entropy (\u0394S\u2021 = \u2013103.6 J mol\u20131) obtained as result of the thermodynamic study, indicate that the reaction was endergonic and kinetically controlled in nature.",

The constructive strategy integrated nano-octahedral BFW and hierarchical IS by growing IS ultrathin nanosheet subunits on surface of BFW. The proposed in site synthesis route resulted in a high dispersion of BFW nanocrystals and the tight interaction between BFW and IS. The obtained core-shell heterostructure boosted separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, evidenced by electrochemical measurement. The hierarchical structure on the surface of BFW@IS-x catalyst enhanced light harvest and provided ample active sites for surface redox reactions. Profiting from these extraordinary chemical and physical characteristics owing to the interaction between BFW and IS, the efficiency of photo-conversion of CO2 to CH4 and CO over BFW@IS-1 heterostructures with optimal proportion was 49.9\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009h\u22121\u2009g\u22121 and 28.9\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009h\u22121\u2009g\u22121, respectively, under visible light irradiation. The CH4 generated rate was about 3.5 and 6.4 times higher than that of pure IS and BFW, and CO generated rates was 4.9 times higher than that of pure IS, respectively. The possible mechanism for the CO2 reduction over BFW@IS-1 composite was discussed.",

Various Fe-M bimetallic surfaces were constructed with varied surface atomic ratios of Fe/(Fe\u2009+\u2009M), based on which CO2 and atomic H* adsorptions were systematically examined. The H* was found to be energetically favorable adsorbed at the 4-fold hollow site of Fe-M catalysts and the adsorption stability was slightly impacted by the surface content of the introduced transition metal. For CO2 adsorption, stable bent structures adsorbed on the 4-fold hollow sites were identified on Fe-Ni and Fe-Co surfaces, no matter at which Fe-M formulations. However, on Fe-Pd surfaces, CO2 adsorption configurations were found to be sensitive to surface Pd content, resulting in large distinctions in adsorption stabilities of CO2 as compared to Fe-Co and Fe-Ni surfaces. CO2 dissociation and initial hydrogenation were comparatively investigated on Fe-M bimetallic surfaces, and the calculation results demonstrated that CO2 conversion properties are similar over Fe-Ni and Fe-Co catalysts, with CO* and HCOO* as the preferred intermediates but the barriers are still above 0.8\u2009eV. While on Fe-Pd bimetallic surfaces, CO2 reactions exhibit significant distinctions with varying the surface Pd content, showing a dramatic preference (Eact around 0.3\u223c0.4\u2009eV) towards HCOO* and CO* formation at surface Pd/(Pd\u2009+\u2009Fe) atomic ratios of 4/9 and 5/9.

The overall efficiency of photo-reduction of CO2 to fuels can be improved through the development of highly efficient catalyst and suitable photoreactor configuration.

In this perspective, this review presents state of the art accomplishments in photocatalytic CO2 reduction through engineering approach towards reactor configuration and design aspects. In the main stream, the perspectives of different types of photo-reactors employed for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 has been discussed. Slurry, fixed bed and membrane photo-reactors have been identified as the main categories that are critically discussed based on their operational mode, type of bed, number of phases involved, membrane used and type of light source. Comparative analysis of photo-reactors is also being employed to improve selectivity and photo-conversion rates of these photo-reactors. The influence of the factors such as light position and distribution, material of construction, temperature and pressure on the production of fuels has also been explicated.

The catalysts were substantially exposed to different characterisation techniques both before and after the reaction to get an insight into the structure-activity relationship. Characterisation results and activity study confirmed, homogeneous dispersion of nanosized ruthenium particles over a high surface area of modified silica possess strong metal support interaction, which restricts metal sintering and enables coke free CO2 reforming of methane (DRM). Introduction of ceria and magnesia strongly enhanced the surface oxygen storage capacity (OSC) that readily oxidise the deposited coke over the active metal during the activity analysis. An in-detailed study was carried out to evaluate the effect of reaction parameters and long-term activity analysis on the material. The catalyst systems with lower Ru loading performs a better activity in comparison to higher loading. At a higher Ruthenium loading, the metal particle size gets increase and remains mainly over the surface rather than in the pores which enhances the rate of coke deposition and hence decreases the catalyst activity.",

Firstly, pH and 1HNMR were used to demonstrate that N,N-diethylethanolamine (DEEA) with the excellent CO2 response could be treated as potential switchable water. In addition, N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) was chosen as a suitable hydrophobic tertiary amine, because DMA is a more steady molecular state than DEEA at the same pH. Then, the composite switchable water (DMA\u2009+\u2009DEEA(aq)) was prepared with DMA and DEEA solutions. There was the possible presence of inductive effect between DMA and DEEA detected by 1HNRM and it was also found that DEEA reduced the surface tension. Next, the CO2-triggered switchable behavior of the composite switchable water has been demonstrated by pH and conductivity. Finally, a practical application of washing oil sands with the composite switchable water was accomplished. The results showed that the residual oil content of oil sands was reduced to 0.872\u2009wt% from the original 4.64\u2009wt% heavy hydrocarbons (the ratio of DMA in gram to DEEA solutions in mL was 4:15) and both DMA and DEEA solutions also were recycled during the process.

     "abstract": "In this paper, a gliding arc discharge (GAD) is investigated for CO2 decomposition, with particular efforts directed toward improving the performance by optimizing the reactor design. The effects of various parameters, e.g., gas flow rate, configuration of the injector nozzle, and structure of the quartz cover, on the CO2 conversion and energy efficiency are investigated. The results indicate that the variation profiles of CO2 conversion upon rising flow rate can be clearly be divided into two patterns: Pattern A with outlet gas temperature > 440\u2009\u00b0C and Pattern B with outlet gas temperature < 440\u2009\u00b0C. The CO2 conversion rises in Pattern A but decreases in Pattern B with the increase in flow rate. The relatively high temperature in Pattern A is negatively correlated with CO2 conversion because it can stimulate the recombination of CO and O, which leads to the increase in CO2 conversion with increasing flow rate (and decreasing gas temperature). A smaller injector nozzle diameter (1.0\u2009mm) exhibits a better performance in terms of both CO2 conversion and energy efficiency under most of the conditions studied, and a longer distance between the injector nozzle and electrodes is beneficial to the CO2 conversion at relatively high flow rates (\u2265 4\u2009L/min). A quadrangular reactor cover was proved to have a better space utilization and a higher fraction of gas treatment by plasma, which can ensure a more adequate contact between the injected gas and plasma, and thus a better performance. The optimum conditions are: flow rate\u2009=\u20093\u2009L/min, nozzle diameter\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009mm, distance between injector nozzle and electrodes\u2009=\u20095.0\u2009mm, and a quadrangular cover, under which CO2 conversion and energy efficiency up to 11.1% and 20.7% can be achieved.

Theoretically, a mathematical model including Fick\u2019s diffusion equation and Peng\u2013Robinson Equation of State (PR EOS) is proposed to evaluate the mass transfer of CO2 in the cores with different permeabilities. Experimentally, the pressure-decay method is employed by monitoring the CO2 pressure in the diffusion cell during diffusion experiments. The CO2 diffusion coefficients in the cores with different permeabilities are determined when the discrepancy of the calculated and measured pressure-decay curves has been minimized. The diffusion coefficient of supercritical CO2 increases gradually with rising permeability at the range of 0.1\u201310 mD, and then it reaches a plateau at the permeability range of 10\u2013300 mD. The impact of the permeability on the CO2 diffusion coefficient is attributed to the pore radius and pore structure of the cores. The Pore radius of the core whose permeability is less than 10 mD is less than 1\u2009\u03bcm, and pore walls restrict CO2 mass transfer under such condition, which accounts for the relative low diffusion coefficient. When the permeability exceeds 10 mD, the pore radius is larger than 1\u2009\u03bcm, and the influence of the solid boundary is negligible. Moreover, the textural coefficients of cores decrease with the permeability, which shows that the less tortuous pore structure facilitates the mass transfer process. Diffusive tortuosities for the cores with different permeabilities are determined by using the CO2 diffusion coefficients in porous media and bulk phase, which show the same trend with the pore radius distribution.",

The morphological, crystalline, band alignment and optical properties of the samples are investigated intensively. Photocatalytic performance is evaluated by measuring the ability of the photocatalysts to convert CO2 into CO and hydrocarbon fuels, primarily CH4. The composites exhibit more efficient photocatalytic activity than CdS and BiVO4, and the yields of CH4 and CO vary depending on the thickness of BiVO4 substrate.

Several methods were applied to investigate the alteration of rock properties by CO2-water-carbonate minerals interactions: 1) Core flooding to measure overall changes, 2) MICP and X-ray CT to analyze small pores and large pores, respectively, 3) SEM, PCM, and ICP to verify physical and chemical reactions.Oil recovery was higher in Edwards white than in Indiana limestone, since characteristic of Edwards white contributes to sufficient contact time and stable displacement between oil and CO2. From the analysis of the alteration of rock properties in homogenous sample, dissolution facilitates the enlargement of pore sizes. Therefore, fluid flow becomes more favorable. The precipitation is not critical determinant of alteration process, despite the high proportion of small pores. For heterogeneous sample, both dissolution and precipitation significantly affect to alteration of pore structure. Particularly, the precipitation seriously damaged to the main flow channels. These undesirable effects on fluid flow appeared at injection point, which was exposed to fresh CO2 for a long time.This study suggests that pore structure analysis allows a more exact interpretation and judgment of the alteration of pore structure by dissolution and precipitation and can assist in designing injection plans, particularly near the injection area or in complex pore structure.",

     "abstract": "Contrary to conventional methane dry reforming on metallic catalyst using electric heating, dry reforming catalyzed by biomass-derived char with microwave heating was studied in this work. The results showed bio-char catalytic activity could be affected by raw material for char preparation, since it was greatly connected to the remained metal after char preparation. As a whole, cotton stalk char presented better activity than others. Bio-char with a particle size in 0.25\u20130.83\u2009mm was suitable for being served as the catalyst. Supporting an appropriate additive on bio-char, particularly for Ni, was effective to improve bio-char catalytic ability. Original bio-char could only maintain its catalytic effect at an acceptable level in 70\u2009min, due to an unavoidable carbon gasification reaction. Nevertheless, carbon gasification meanwhile generated part of CO production and it was a contributor to total syngas production. When applying original bio-char for the reforming reaction, the contribution of char-derived CO production to total syngas production was finally up to 10.2%. Deposited bio-char obtained from methane decomposition could be self-regenerated, when further using for dry reforming. No matter original bio-char or deposited bio-char was adopted, a noticeable decrease of H2/CO ratio passed through the test. For example, the ratio achieved on original bio-char reduced from 0.88 to 0.71. Through carbon balance and direct weight measurement, it was obtained a loss by 8.3% was occurred on original bio-char after the test.",

     "abstract": "Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have shown good catalytic activity for electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, they are typically stabilized by poorly conductive organic ligands which partially block their activity for electrocatalysis. In this work, we report a one-pot organic ligand-free synthesis of AuNPs on mesoporous carbon (MC). The size of the AuNPs is controlled by the micro- and mesoporosity of the carbon support and the mass ratio employed of the gold precursor/MC. The produced AuNPs-MC hybrid material, with the largest amount of small AuNPs (1\u20133\u2009nm), shows good catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in aqueous electrolyte. The optimized selectivity is recorded to be, on average, 80% with a mass activity of 12.8\u2009A g\u20131 at an overpotential of 550\u2009mV. The catalyst stability of the material is investigated to give insight into the irreversible deactivation mechanism occurring at the surface of AuNPs. Using 6-mercapto-1-hexanol as the ligand on AuNPs shows a dual effect in terms of an improved stability but a lowered activity.",

     "abstract": "abrasive supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) jet perforation is the key procedure in the SC-CO2 fracturing, which will directly affect the exploitation of oil and gas. The properties of the SC-CO2 fluid, such as density, viscosity, diffusivity and so on, change greatly with the variation of temperature and pressure, which directly affect the particle-carrying ability and perforation performance. This paper investigates the influence of key parameters, such as ambient pressure, fluid temperature, jet standoff distance and jet pressure, on the perforation ability of abrasive SC-CO2 jet. The results indicate that the ambient pressure has no significant effect on perforation under the condition of a fixed jet differential pressure. When the confining pressure increases from 5 to 15 MPa, the hole depth and diameter decrease by 5.7% and 18.6% respectively. The hole depth increases slightly with the rising of jet temperature. In addition, with the jet temperature rising per 20\u2103 within the range from 40 to 100\u2103 and the standoff distances being 4 to 10 mm, the hole depths increase by 3.8% and 12.0% in average, respectively. Furthermore, the hole depths keep unchanged at first and then decrease rapidly with the increasing standoff distance. However, the hole diameters and effectively impinged areas increase with the standoff distance. The influences of SC-CO2 jet pressure on the perforation performance are similar to that of the conventional jet. Additonally, both effective hole depths and volumes increase linearly in general with the increasing of jet pressure. The hole depths averagely increase by 36.6% when the SC-CO2 jet pressure rising by 5 MPa. Furthermore, the research also shows that perforation performance of pre-mixed jet is better than the post-mixed jet, the volume ratio of the two kinds of perforating holes is 12.02 under these experimental conditions. All the above merits have provided a theoretical foundation and experimental proven for the field application of SC-CO2 jet perforation technology.",

Two AHA-ILs with remarkably different behavior as CO2 chemical absorbent were considered: triethyl(octyl)-phosphonium indazole, [P2228][Inda], and triethyl(octyl)-phosphonium 2-cyanopyrrol-1-ide [P2228][2-CNPyr]. The structure and energy of reaction intermediates were predicted by Density Functional Theory (DFT) method, observing that CO2 and AHA-IL reaction form an anionic carbamate that promotes a nucleophilic attack on the propylene oxide, causing the ring opening with negligible energy barrier. Later intramolecular cyclization occurs, followed by the AHA-IL regeneration and propylene carbonate production, both requiring appreciable activation energy. The proposed reaction mechanism were experimentally validated by ATR-FTIR measurements, identifying the characteristic signals of reactants, products and intermediate species. Finally, the reaction using the AHA-ILs [P2228][Inda] and [P2228][2-CNPyr] was followed over time using operando ATR-FTIR technique at different operating conditions (temperature and catalyst concentration). A close relationship between the performance of AHA-IL as CO2 chemical absorbent and CO2 conversion catalyst is revealed, opening opportunities for the efficient application of AHA-ILs in intensified process of CO2 capture and utilization.",

Therefore, investigations on gas adsorption in shales are of great importance. Recent researches evidenced that organic matter (OM) in shale is the major control on its adsorption behavior, but in some cases, mineral components (MC) may also play a role. Herein, we focus on the alteration of porosity due to the presence of OM-MC interface and their influence on gas adsorption, these cannot be simply attributed to either OM or MC as frequently reported in the previous publications. In this context, OM from a shale sample was purified following reported methodology, while a universal procedure for extraction of MC was established. Further studies on the porosity and adsorption behavior were carried out on OM, MC, and shale, which were then compared with a hypothetic mixture (HM) from OM and MC bearing the same composition of shale. For the first time, we demonstrate experimentally the profound effect of porosity at the OM-MC interface on gas adsorption of shales particularly at temperatures more relevant to reservoir conditions. The current work deepened the understanding on gas adsorption of shale, and thus shed meaningful lights on related areas such as gas-in-place (GIP) estimation, CO2 sequestration in shales, and particularly the utilization of CO2 for enhanced shale gas recovery.",

Firstly, the database was examined by exploratory data analysis using box and whiskers plots. Then, decision tree analysis was applied to determine the significance of the variables and to reveal the conditions leading to higher faradaic efficiency, production rate and product selectivity. It was found that Cu content smaller than 71% resulted high faradaic efficiencies depending on the amount of Sn, catholyte type, applied potential and pH of electrolyte. In this case, applied potential and Cu content were found to have the highest significance among all the input variables. On the other hand, the most generalizable combination of variables leading to high level of rate occurred when the Cu content being less than 13%, using a membrane other than Selemion AMV, employing a backing layer such as TGP-H-60 and keeping the applied potential between \u22121.5 and \u22122.6\u2009V; for which the applied potential and CO2 flow rate were determined as the highest significant variables. Finally, the most generalizable path for the case of selectivity was obtained with Sn content higher than 15% and Cu content less than 52%, which leaded to formic acid production having the highest production rates. It was then concluded that, exploratory data analysis and decision trees can provide useful information to determine the conditions leading to higher CO2\u2212 electroreduction performance that may guide the future studies in this area.",

The effects of reaction temperature, CO2 pressure, reaction time and the loading of catalyst on the synthesis of propylene carbonate (PC) from CO2 and propylene oxide were investigated. Under the optimized reaction conditions, PNPs-Im2ZnBr2I2-1 showed the highest catalytic activity, and PC was yielded to 95.5% with 99.5% of selectivity and 1910\u2009h\u20131 of TOF. In the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxides, the catalysts shows good chemical stability, and can be separated conveniently from the products after reaction and reused for five runs without significant loss of activity. It is suggested that the superior catalytic performance of the as-fabricated catalysts may be attributed to the synergistic effects of zinc atom, imidazolium cation, and halide anion on the activation of epoxide and CO2, respectively.

The effects of intermolecular interactions on the copolymer properties in SC-CO2 were identified.

The fabricated EPSNF were modified by a multistage procedure including acid treatment, silanization followed by activation with glutaraldehyde. The effects of regenerated NADH concentration and time of enzymatic reaction on the formate production in the both systems were studied. The results indicated that the EPSNF immobilized FDH had a desirable activity, long-term storage stability (41% after 20 days) and reusability after eight cycles of successive reactions (53% of the initial activity). Moreover, it was revealed that the increase of cofactor concentration at the early times of reaction was favorable to the formate production.

     "abstract": "In this study, hollow-structured Bi decorated g-C3N4 hybrids were successfully fabricated by a simple solvothermal method and applied for the first time to the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Remarkably, the composites exhibited excellent CO2 conversion efficiencies in the presence of H2O under visible light irradiation compared to unmodified g-C3N4, especially for the production of CH4. The optimum photocatalyst 30-Bi/g-C3N4 presented the best production of CO and CH4, approximately 3 times and 9 times as high as those of unmodified g-C3N4, respectively. A series of characterizations were conducted to explore the essence behind such an enhancement; we found that enhanced light harvesting, quick separation of photoinduced carriers and more negative conduction band, due to the formation of a Schottky junction between g-C3N4 and Bi metal and the solvothermal process, co-contributed for the enhanced CO2 conversion; A more important finding was that the surprising improvement of CH4 yield stem primarily from the introduction of the hollow-structured Bi, which enabled the accumulation of electrons on its surface exhibiting the metal-like property. The CO2 photocatalytic conversion process was also investigated by in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) spectroscopy and we found that HCO3\u2212 and CO2\u2212 were active intermediates over 30-Bi/g-C3N4 and Bi doping could promote the activation of CO2.

     "abstract": "The Province of Siena (Tuscany, Italy) is characterized by two features: 1) the carbon neutrality of its territory and 2) the great production of quality wine. The GHG balance of the Province of Siena, realized in time series according to the IPCC guidelines and validated ISO 14064-1 under the REGES Project, testifies the carbon neutrality of the territory (the percentage abatement of gross emissions passed from 72% in 2006 to 106% in 2015). This ambitious goal was achieved in 2011 after the activation of specific environmental policies (concerning energy and waste sectors, forests, transport and education) with local benefits in the short run. This paper presents a systemic investigation of the effects of the application of technologies for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture/storage on the GHG balance of the provincial area; in particular, recovery of biogenic CO2 from alcoholic fermentation of grapes could be seen as a new strategy to consolidate the status of carbon neutrality. The hypothetical installation of recovery plants in Siena wine farms could approximately capture more than 6000\u2009t CO2, corresponding to an improvement of the GHG balance of the territory (i.e. increase of net absorption of almost 8%). CO2 can be captured and stocked in high-pressure containers and reused in production activities, both within and outside the area, avoiding the use of gas obtained in chemical industries by fossil fuel-driven production processes. The economic evaluation confirms good performances obtained by the environmental assessment. These results can inspire policies at the farm level for reducing impacts on GHG emissions from a life cycle thinking viewpoint and at the territorial (or producer consortia) level, in order to decrease impacts by means of dedicated projects, generating positive effects on the local carbon balance and relevant consequences at global scale.",

In this study, two marine shale samples and two terrestrial shale samples were prepared and treated with subcritical CO2 (30 \u2103 and 5\u2009MPa) and supercritical CO2 (80 \u2103 and 20\u2009MPa) in a geochemical reactor. Various methods, including low-pressure carbon dioxide adsorption (LP-CO2A), low-pressure nitrogen adsorption (LP-N2A), high-pressure mercury intrusion porosimetry (HP-MIP) and fractal theory, were used to gain insights into the changes in the shale pore structure after 14 days of CO2 saturation. According to the results, the phase states of CO2 obviously affected the variations of pore structure parameters during the physical and chemical reactions in shales. Interactions of supercritical CO2 with shales created a more obvious effect on the pore structure compared to those of subcritical CO2, which was attributed to the greater dissolution and expansion effect as well as the extraction mechanism associated with supercritical CO2. After exposing the shale samples to subcritical CO2, the pore size distributions (PSDs) of the treated shale samples were lower than those of the raw samples at all diameter scales, indicating that the number of pores decreased due to the reactions. Furthermore, it was found that after supercritical CO2 treatment, the micropore and mesopore structure parameters of the marine shale samples obviously decreased with an increase in macropore structure parameters, leading to the reduction in fractal dimensions in smaller pores, while the terrestrial shale samples appeared to represent a contrary trend. These findings will provide experimental evidence for further assessment of the mechanisms for CO2 geological sequestration with enhanced shale gas recovery.",

Alkaline synthesis conditions (pH\u2009=\u20098) positively affected CO2 conversion and CH3OH yield (< 250\u2009\u00b0C), as CuO and Cu2O phases were present, since Cu2+ was only partially reduced.

The XPS profiles of fresh, pre-treated and spent heterogeneous catalysts indicated that the dispersed copper moieties were reduced (to Cu0 or Cu+) during CO2 hydrogenation.

Recent experimental studies have revealed that the MIL-101(Cr) can effectively catalyze the cycloaddition conversion of CO2 with the aid of the tetrabutylammonium bromide(TBAB). However, the mechanistic details remain largely unraveled. In this work, we undertook a detailed DFT study on the cycloaddition reaction catalyzed by the binary system MIL-101/TBAB in comparison with the non-catalyzed, MIL-101-catalyzed alone and TBAB-catalyzed alone reactions. The three-step route involving the consecutive ring-opening of PO (propylene oxide), insertion of carbon dioxide, and ring-closure of cyclic carbonate was found to be kinetically more favorable than the two-step route (ring-opening of PO and ring-closure of cyclic carbonate). Based on the rate-determining activation energy barrier, the cycloaddition of CO2 to PO proceeds in a much easier way in the presence of MIL-101/TBAB (18.11\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121) than the non-catalyzed (57.67\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121), MIL-101-catalyzed (46.89\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121) and TBAB-catalyzed (26.86\u2009kcal\u2009mol\u22121) alone reactions. The computational findings can satisfactorily explain the available experimental observations, enabling a molecular-level understanding of congener catalysts for organic carbonate production as well as the rational design of more powerful MOF-orientated catalysts.",

     "abstract": "The design of a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) system requires the development of a complex model that can describe the dynamics of adsorption in a fixed-bed, which means a labor intensive and time consuming work, especially when several adsorbents are going to be compared. Therefore, it would be very useful to establish a simple procedure to quickly assess the performance during the early stages of PSA systems design. The aim of this work is to develop a simplistic approach that drives the decision-making process on the adsorbent in a shorter time. A combined experimental and numerical study of CO2/CH4 adsorption is presented. Thus, three commercial activated carbons are compared in their performance to separate CO2 from biogas under PSA conditions by means of equilibrium adsorption data. A straightaway model, developed to approach PSA systems in a very simple way, where the only input is equilibrium of adsorption data, has been adopted. The Adsorption Figure of Merit (AFM), CO2 purity and CO2 recovery were selected as performance indicators and they have pointed out one of the activated carbons, MC27, as the most promising adsorbent candidate to separate CO2/CH4 by means of PSA. A sensitivity analysis of the process performance as a function of the bed dimensions has been addressed using the developed short-cut model.",

     "abstract": "The specific interaction (i.e., Lewis acid-base interaction) between CO2 and the ether group in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is expected to significantly affect the mutual solubility in CO2/PEG systems. Therefore, in order to understand the liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) phase behavior under supercritical CO2, the specific intermolecular interaction between CO2 and PEG should be involved in the theoretical modeling of LLE phase behavior for the PEG/CO2 system. In this work, this interaction (i.e., CO2-PEG complex due to the Lewis acid-base interaction) is treated by the perturbed-chain SAFT (PC-SAFT) model as a cross-association between CO2 and PEG. The cross-association energy parameter is estimated from the experimental enthalpy by the Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectroscopy method for CO2 and the ether group in PEG. The correlated pressure and temperature (P-T) isopleth curve with the cross-association between CO2 and PEG is much closer to the experimental data. The degree of cross-association decreases as the temperature increases. This strong cross-association leads to a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) phase behavior, even at supercritical conditions.",

Moreover, 0.5\u2009wt%Pd-0.1\u2009wt%Au/TiO2-WO3 exhibited a 43-fold higher CH4 production rate than did TiO2 alone.

     "abstract": "In this manuscript, we present the results of a systematic approach to investigate the impact of core scale heterogeneity on the efficiency of miscible CO2 water-alternating-gas (WAG) flooding performance. Both vertical (by layering two axially-cut half plugs with differing permeability) and horizontal (stacking two smaller core samples with differing permeability in series) heterogeneities are explored. In the layered or vertically heterogeneous sample, the permeability ratio (PR) defines the ratio between the permeability values of each half plug. Our special sample construction technique using either a thin impermeable Teflon sheet to prevent flow communication or a thin tissue to promote flow communication has enabled us to investigate the effect of crossflow between half plug on the performance of the WAG flood. For the stacked composite or the horizontally heterogeneous core samples, short cylindrical core segments were used each with a different permeability value. We have also investigated the effect of the EOR injection mode (i.e. secondary vs. tertiary) on our results. For this study, core flooding experiments were performed using n-C10, brine and CO2 at a temperature of 343\u2009K and a pressure of 12.4\u2009MPa.The results obtained for homogeneous, layered and composite samples indicate that CO2 WAG flood performs better in all cases and achieves the highest recovery factor (RF) when conducted under the secondary mode (e.g. homogeneous: 93.4%, layered: 74.0%, and composite: 90.9%) compared with the tertiary mode (e.g. homogeneous: 74.2%, layered: 64.1%, and composite: 71.3%). For the layered samples, it was found that the oil recovery decreases noticeably with an increase in the permeability ratio (PR). For instance, RFs of 93.4%, 90.1%, 78.8%, and 74.0% correspond to PRs of 1, 2.5, 5, and 12.5, respectively. In contrast to our previous findings with continuous CO2 flooding which showed that crossflow enhances recovery in layered samples, for this study using WAG, crossflow was found to negatively affect the RF. Such an outcome may be attributed to the conformance control achieved by WAG flooding which would be more pronounced in the case of non-communication layers (i.e. no cross flow). In other words, the higher oil recovery of WAG flooding in a non-communicating system may be due to the dominance of viscous forces and, to a lesser extent, the vanishing effect of gravity forces that tend to reduce sweep efficiency. The effect of composite heterogeneity on the RF was also investigated with the results showing that the permeability sequence along the length of a composite sample has a noticeable but more subtle impact on RF.",

All experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure with a concentration of 10% molar CO2 in the feed gas. The operational variables were temperature (15\u201355\u2009\u00b0C), input solvent flow rate (0\u20130.04\u2009l\u2009min\u22121), inlet gas flow rate (1\u20139\u2009l.min\u22121), and MEA concentration in the solvent (0\u201340\u2009wt.%). The results showed that by increasing the concentration of MEA in the solvent, and increasing the solvent flow rate, a significant increase occurred in the absorption percentage and overall gas-based volumetric mass transfer coefficient. Increasing the gas flow rate also caused a reduction in the absorption percentage and an increase in the overall gas-based volumetric mass transfer coefficient. However, the operating temperature within a range of 15\u201355\u2009\u00b0C did not have a significant impact on absorption rate. In optimal operating conditions, the absorption percentage was 100%, and the overall gas-based volumetric mass transfer coefficient of 2685 (kmol\u2009h\u22121\u2009m-3\u2009kPa\u22121) was reached. The overall gas-based volumetric mass transfer coefficient indicates that, compared with other mass transfer devices, the use of a microchannel-reactor resulted in a higher level of increase in absorption efficiency.",

However, the efficiency of conversion from electrical energy to thermal energy for the reactant is not sufficiently high, resulting in challenges in practical applications of the arc in various chemical processes. In this study, a method is introduced to enhance the energy usage efficiency for the reactant. The enhancement is based on the control of the arc length elongation. An increase in the arc length results in an enhanced heat transfer from the arc column to the reactant, followed by the reduction of the conductive heat loss to the reactor body. The existing DC arc technologies cannot easily extend the arc length because of the arc instability. However, in this study, a novel AC arc technology was adopted that can support a stable arc with a sufficiently elongated length. Correspondingly, a comparative study on different arc lengths was conducted for the dry reforming (as a model reaction). The increased arc length results in an enhanced heat transfer to the gas or a higher gas temperature. This is followed by the enhancement of the conversions of the reactants for the same supplied electric power. The results provide a firm physical basis for further optimizations of the arc process for chemical reactions.",

To this end, batch and continuous experiments were carried out in an experimental plant constituted by four high rate algal ponds (500\u2009L each) treating urban wastewater with and without pH regulation.

Moreover, a positive effect on microalgal biomass concentration was observed, reducing the effect of the variation in influent wastewater characteristics. Concerning the microalgal populations, the variation of inorganic carbon availability induced a shift in the dominant microalgae species. In spite of this, no variations were observed in terms of wastewater treatment efficiency. Taking together, this study highlighted the positive effect of CO2 addition to increase biomass production and control microalgae species in high rate algal ponds treating wastewater.",

Here, the photoautotrophic metabolism is described as an integrated production process, in which fixated CO2 and N2 are essential raw materials processed through primary and secondary metabolic reactions powered by light-derived chemical energy. Large scale application of cyanobacterial biofactories is still a technical challenge due to low yields and commoditization of biotechnological products. However, the development of feasible cyanobacterial biofactories can be enhanced through synthetic biology efforts relying on the natural ability of cyanobacteria to synthesize carbohydrates and peptides.

To avoid any complexities arising from the heterogeneous matrix of soil, heavy oil contaminated soil was artificially mimicked by means of homogenizing sand and bunker C (the mass ratio of sand to oil was adjusted as 10). The TGA (thermo-gravimetric analysis)/DTG (differential thermogram)/DSC (differential scanning calorimeter) tests of bunker C oil in N2 and CO2 revealed that all physical aspects ruling mass loss, thermal degradation rate, and energy input were not affected by reaction medium (CO2). However, all pyrogenic products were noticeably modified in the thermal degradation of bunker C oil contaminated soil in the CO2 environment under the ambient pressure. In detail, shifting carbon distribution from the liquid products to the gaseous products (syngas) in the presence of CO2 was observed. Also, the thermal degradation of bunker C oil contaminated soil led to carbon fixation onto soil, but the surface morphologies of charring material was modified in the presence of CO2. Considering that no leaching of any chemical species from charring material, pyrolysis of heavy oil could be a viable option to remediate and stabilize heavy oil contaminated soil while recovering energy.

     "abstract": "In this work, the multicycle activity of natural CaO precursors (limestone and dolomite) and Ca-based composites (Ca3Al2O6/CaCO3 and ZrO2/CaCO3 mixtures) has been studied for Thermochemical Energy Storage (TCES) in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants by means of the Calcium-Looping process (CaL), using two integration schemes proposed elsewhere that differ in the calcination stages. Under CSP-He conditions, calcination for CaO regeneration is performed under pure He at low temperatures (725\u2009\u00b0C) while under CPS-CO2 conditions calcination is carried out under pure CO2 at high temperatures (950\u2009\u00b0C). The latter avoids the use of selective membranes to separate He from CO2 even though it requires the use of more expensive materials for solar receptors. Carbonation/calcination conditions drastically affect the multicycle CO2 uptake of the materials tested. Effective multicycle conversion is higher in CSP-He tests due to the mild conditions employed for calcination, which mitigates CaO sintering. On the other hand, the harsh calcination conditions used in CSP-CO2 tests enhance sintering of CaO derived from limestone and the Ca3Al2O6/CaCO3 composite due to the low Tammann temperature of Ca3Al2O6. CaO sintering is hindered by the presence of inert oxides with high Tammann temperatures, such as ZrO2 in the ZrO2/CaCO3 composite and MgO in dolomite. Dolomite derived CaO shows high effective conversion values along the carbonation/calcination cycles when tested under both types of conditions, as compared to limestone and the composites, which suggests that the integration scheme based on CSP-CO2 conditions would be a feasible alternative to CSP-He if natural dolomite were used as CaO precursor.",

NAPs are synthesized using metal-catalyst free polycondensations in basic medium. These are thermally stable, microporous (Type-I isotherms in N2 adsorption\u2013desorption measurements at 77\u2009K) and have moderately high surface areas (SABET\u2009=\u20091095 and 923\u2009m2\u2009g\u22121). NAPs show enhanced surface areas relative to either triptycene networks with azo-linkages or porphyrinic polymers having azo bridges. NAPs register high CO2 uptake (upto 3.93\u2009mmol\u2009g\u22121 at 1\u2009bar and 273\u2009K) with good CO2/N2 selectivity (upto 64:1 at 273\u2009K) for CO2 capture from flue gas. Incorporation of CO2-philic porphyrin rings and N2-phobic azo groups results in improved CO2/N2 selectivity in these triptycene based microporous polymers. Performance of NAPs as nanoporous polymer (in terms of gas sorption properties such as surface areas, low pressure gas uptake and gas selectivity) is also better than several non-triptycene/porphyrin but azo based porous organic polymers (POPs).

Measures to recover this permeability reduction are of significant importance for the field projects. Many studies to date have established the responses of the coal matrix upon the adsorption of CO2 under various laboratory conditions, and some have revealed that the injection of N2 into swelled coal can recover coal permeability to some extent. This study therefore examines the effect of various N2 saturation durations on the permeability alteration of the swelled coals subjected to the adsorption of sub- and super-critical CO2 at different reservoir depths. A series of permeability tests was performed on a tri-axial test rig, and the results show that high adsorption of super-critical CO2 in coal produces greater permeability reduction; the average CO2 permeability recovery rates are 25.08% and 37.31% for 6\u2009MPa and 14\u2009MPa N2 saturation, respectively, as the higher N2 permeating pressure favours greater permeability recovery; longer N2 saturation duration also produces higher permeability recovery, but the permeability recovery process eases with the saturation duration; coal permeability is very susceptible to the poro-elastic effect in high confining environments and the effect of matrix responses on the interaction with gas sorption is therefore negligible.",

However, due to the massive diversity in mineralogy and physicochemistry of different reservoirs, the current data base is not yet sufficient to conclusively determine the alterations of geochemical prosperities when CO2 is injected especially for tight reservoirs. The attention of this work was given to a tight sandstone reservoir in Lucaogou formation of Jimsar sag (China). The interactions of reservoir rocks, formation brine and supercritical CO2 were extensively investigated under reservoir conditions (75\u2009\u00b0C and 32\u2009MPa) aiming to reveal possible mechanisms behind. The results showed that the dissolution of supercritical CO2 in the brine created an acidic environment (solubility\u2009=\u20090.94\u2009mol/Kg), which induced the dissolution of minerals into the brine and their subsequent precipitation. The primary precipitants in this work were found to be iron minerals and kaolinite, as evidenced by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersion Spectrum (SEM-EDS) analyses. Moreover, the SEM-EDS observations have shown clear signs of mineralogical changes of the rocks with the preferred dissolution of K-feldspar, albite and ankerite. Kaolinitation due to the corrosion of K-feldspar and albite occurred during the CO2-exposure experiments. The mineral surface after exposure to CO2 was altered to be more water-wet as a result of mineral dissolution, kaolinite formation and surface corrosion.",

     "abstract": "CO2 reforming of methane is an effective route for carbon dioxide recycling to valuable syngas. However conventional catalysts based on Ni fail to overcome the stability requisites in terms of resistance to coking and sintering. In this scenario, the use of Sn as promoter of Ni leads to more powerful bimetallic catalysts with enhanced stability which could result in a viable implementation of the reforming technology at commercial scale. This paper uses a combined computational (DFT) and experimental approach, to address the fundamental aspects of mitigation of coke formation on the catalyst\u2019s surface during dry reforming of methane (DRM). The DFT calculation provides fundamental insights into the DRM mechanism over the mono and bimetallic periodic model surfaces. Such information is then used to guide the design of real powder catalysts. The behaviour of the real catalysts mirrors the trends predicted by DFT. Overall the bimetallic catalysts are superior to the monometallic one in terms of long-term stability and carbon tolerance. In particular, low Sn concentration on Ni surface effectively mitigate carbon formation without compromising the CO2 conversion and the syngas production thus leading to excellent DRM catalysts. The bimetallic systems also presents higher selectivity towards syngas as reflected by both DFT and experimental data. However, Sn loading has to be carefully optimized since a relatively high amount of Sn can severely deter the catalytic performance.",

It is aimed at determining an optimum gasification condition for enhancing the production of syngas with a flexible H2 to CO molar ratio (H2/CO), which is essential in many petrochemical processes. The research is performed by simulation in ASPEN Plus, where steam and CO2 are fed as co-gasifying agents. The equilibrium concentrations of the product gas are obtained, and the H2/CO as well as the heating value of the resulting syngas are quantified. It is found that the inclusion of CO2 as a co-gasifying agent promotes CO evolution through the Boudouard reaction. However, it reduces H2 concentration, and consequently decreases the H2/CO. Furthermore, the effects of some process parameters have been studied in this work. It is observed that H2/CO reduces with a rise in temperature, increases with increasing CO2 to biomass ratio (CBR), and shows no significant change with pressure. Results further show that methanol synthesis from syngas can be achieved at temperatures close to 660\u202f\u00b0C, while oxo-synthesis requires a higher temperature. A CBR of around 0.6 in the present work would be an optimum value for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to achieve a H2/CO of 2:1, but the CBR should be lower for processes requiring a lower H2/CO like acetic acid formation and oxo-synthesis.",

The study was conducted by aging two types of specimens (i.e. cement cores and SBS samples made of steel pipe and cement). After curing, the specimens were aged for 14 days in an autoclave. The autoclave was 80% filled with brine saturated with mixed gas containing CO2 and CH4. Aging pressure (21\u201362\u202fMPa), temperature (38\u2013221\u202f\u00b0C) and CO2 concentration (10\u2013100% CO2) were varied.

The analysis showed that temperature has a more prominent effect on the carbonation process than pressure and CO2 concentration. Furthermore, results showed strong interaction effect among the main influential factors (pressure, temperature and CO2 concentration). SBS increased with the carbonation. Medium-range temperatures (107 and 177\u202f\u00b0C) caused high levels of carbonation as manifested by huge improvement in SBS and a significant reduction in porosity after exposure to a carbonic acid environment.",

     "abstract": "An organic-inorganic hybrid catalyst was synthesized by silylation of silanol (SiOH) groups with ammonium bromide group on the mesopore wall of mesoporous zeolite having a hierarchically nanoporous architecture, conferring both electrophilic and nucleophilic functions due to the acid sites of the zeolite and bromide in the functional group, respectively. In the coupling of carbon dioxide and propylene oxide for production of propylene carbonate, the hybrid catalyst exhibited a synergistic enhancement in activity leading to a two-fold higher product yield than the catalysts having a single catalytic function. Comprehensive reaction studies revealed that the catalytic synergy could only be obtained by achieving close proximity between the ammonium bromide group and acid sites on the zeolite surface. The acidity was also crucial, where no synergy was observed for a similarly designed organic-inorganic hybrid catalyst constructed on weakly acidic ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15. Comparison of the activation energy of the catalysts supported the observation that the zeolite-based hybrid catalyst with stronger acidity gave rise to a lower activation energy (37.3\u202fkJ\u202fmol\u22121) than the SBA-15-based hybrid catalyst with weaker acidity (51.3\u202fkJ\u202fmol\u22121). The mesoporous zeolite-based hybrid catalyst was very active under neat conditions without additional organic solvent, and showed good recyclability without significant loss of the initial activity for up to five runs.",

This study presents a solution of using CO2 curing to mitigate the concrete surface salt scaling induced by the freeze-thaw exposure. A laboratory freeze-thaw cyclic test was performed on the concrete made with Portland cement and fly ash. To understand the underlying mechanism, the pore structure of cement paste was evaluated by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption (NAD). It was found that the total pore volume and pore size were noticeably reduced in the CO2-cured samples. CO2 curing leads to a dramatic refinement of the capillary pores, hence lessening the available microporous space for the ice formation. The densified concrete surface accounts for the enhanced resistance to the surface scaling.",

     "abstract": "In this article we report an easy synthetic way towards hyperbranched polyglycerols containing primary amine groups (A-HBPGs). A-HBPGs were synthesized in a two-step procedure including an anionic ring opening copolymerization of the phthalimide-epoxy monomer with glycidol followed by hydrazinolysis of phthalimide groups. Polymeric products of both synthetic steps were characterized using NMR, MALDI-TOF, FTIR, viscosimetry and elemental analysis techniques. The maximum amount of the amine containing units in the products was estimated to be 31\u2009mol%. Introduction of higher amounts of these units was limited by the reactivity (sterical) and viscosity reasons. A-HBPGs showed to be effective in CO2 capture from the ambient air. Adsorbents consisting of A-HBPGs and fumed silica in the 1 to 1\u2009wt ratio were capable of adsorbing up to 85.6\u2009mg of CO2, representing 0.82\u2009mmol CO2 per gram or 36.3\u2009mg CO2 per gram of adsorbent. The measurements confirmed that the amount of adsorbed carbon dioxide was proportional to the number of amine sites in a polymer. The obtained CO2 adsorbents could be regenerated upon by heating. Desorption took place above 80\u2009\u00b0C, but the optimum temperature seemed to be at least 100\u2009\u00b0C. The effect of easier CO2 desorption in presence of HBPG structures reported in the literature in case of our materials has not been confirmed.",

Although there are a large number of CCU alternatives, only a few are able to propose routes for the massive production of marketable CO2 based products with a negative or neutral carbon footprint in the long term. In this work, a conceptual design of a process aimed to produce a cementitious construction material, based on magnesium carbonate trihydrate, also known as nesquehonite, is discussed and experimentally tested. Desalination brines are proposed as the source of aqueous magnesium. However, these brines contain a non-negligible amount of calcium, which interferes in the development of cementitious properties from nesquehonite. In order to avoid this interference, a multi-stage precipitation is proposed, where calcium carbonate precipitates in a first stage, and pure nesquehonite can be obtained in a second stage. A thermodynamic model, based on empirical observations from the precipitation system, is proposed and the technical feasibility of three process alternatives are evaluated against the outcomes from the model. The preferred alternative, from the technical and economic point of view, is to conduct a full absorption of CO2 as aqueous carbonate, which is then split in two streams for both precipitation stages. The advantage of this alternative is the applicability to different types of brines, the probably faster and more economic absorption stage, and the easier control of the reaction conditions, as pH and temperature.",

     "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) could be used as carbon source for chemical production. Compared with the environmental assessment, the economic assessment is related with several open questions. Particularly, it still remains unclear when and under which conditions the CO2-based production might become profitable.Besides production costs, the cost drivers and options to stimulate the CO2-based production of methane, methanol and polyoxymethylene (POM) in Germany are analyzed. In order to consider the CO2-based production in a realistic way, various options of operation and give an outlook for a potentially cost-effective development in the next decades are analyzed. The approach is based on life cycle costing. Raw biogas, waste gases of a cement plant, and flue gases of a waste incineration plant are considered as CO2-sources. The energy needed to convert CO2 into hydrocarbons via electrolysis is assumed to be supplied by wind power from negative residual load, a dedicated wind park, or by power from the grid based on a low-price deal at the electricity exchange. Economic data originates from both industrial processes and process simulations.The results indicate that CO2-based production technologies are not competitive with conventional production methods under present conditions. This is mainly due to high electricity generation costs, high investment costs for electrolysis, and regulative factors like the German Renewable Energy Act (EEG) in case of energy supply from grid. A CO2-based polymer would closer to economic competitiveness than CO2-based platform chemicals. While the decrease in production costs of CO2-based chemicals may be limited in the next decades, a modification of relevant regulative factors could potentially promote an earlier commercialization. Relatively low prices for renewable energy supply may lead to commercialization options of CO2-based products until 2030.",

The as-prepared material NaTaO3-C was annealed at temperatures of 500, 550, 600, 650, and 700\u2009\u00b0C in an air atmosphere, in order to study the crystalline phases present in these samples, and to relate the morphological, physical and chemical properties of the carbon-doped perovskites to the photocatalytic activity to perform the CO2 reduction in aqueous medium. The formation of a composite between the carbon and the perovskite, and the presence of a second phase, Na2Ta4O11, was confirmed through XRD measurements. While it is true that both formations improved the photocatalytic activity of the NaTaO3-C, an optimal carbon amount is a key parameter to reduce the band gap value and diminish the charge transference resistance by an improvement in the electrical conductivity of the sample. It is worth to mention that the optimal ratio between the surface area and crystallinity of the sample was achieved by the NaTaO3-C annealed al 650\u2009\u00b0C. These parameters play an important role to explain an improved photocatalytic activity caused by a higher reactive surface and lower recombination of the charges photogenerated onto larger crystals. The photoelectrochemical tests revealed that the material annealed a 650\u2009\u00b0C is the only sample with a conduction band value more negative than the potential required to perform the generation of formaldehyde from the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

The pH-swing method is a promising process for commercialization of the slag carbonation process among the other indirect carbonation methods due to the high selectivity of calcium extraction and production of high quality PCC. In this study, ligand-based solvents, such as acetic acid, gluconic acid, and citric acid, were examined as new leachates for the extraction step in the pH-swing process. Citric acid showed the highest efficiency, and the extraction efficiencies were estimated based on particle size distribution, concentration of solvent, solid-to-liquid ratio, stirring speed, and temperature. The calcium extraction rate increased with decreasing particle size and S/L ratio and with increasing concentration of solvent and stirring speed. However, extraction efficiency decreased significantly at high temperature because calcium-citrate complexes were precipitated. Along with the experiments, a kinetic study based on the shrinking core model was carried out at temperatures lower than 30\u2009\u00b0C.

     "abstract": "This work proposed a new method for one step fabrication of carbon supported (biochar) Co9S8 composite via the thermo-chemical process of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) and lignin under CO2 atmosphere. A series of pyrolysis were conducted in N2 and CO2 environment, and their thermal degradation behaviors were characterized. The thermogravimetric analysis tests revealed that CO2 did not affect physical aspects of the thermal degradation. However, the influence of CO2 on chemical aspects governing the thermal degradation mechanisms was apparent. As an example of it, carbon supported (biochar) Co9S8 composite was only generated in CO2 environment. The surface morphology and structural matrix of biochar generated from CO2 environment was characterized using various spectroscopic instruments, which confirmed the formation of Co9S8. The formation of Co9S8 was highly affected by the pyrolytic parameters such as temperature and duration for isothermal run. Furthermore, use of CO2 as the reaction medium provided an effective way for modifying pore structure of biochar. More importantly, the formation of highly porous structure and Co9S8 in the presence of CO2 imparted strong catalytic capability. The reaction kinetics of p-nitrophenol (PNP) reduction using CO2-700\u2009\u00b0C and CO2-760\u2009\u00b0C biochar was 9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 and 18\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009s\u22121, respectively, of which performance was superior to other catalytic materials in the literature. Lastly, the successive PNP reduction tests revealed the invulnerable catalytic capability up to 10 PNP reduction cycles. Thus, all experimental findings in this study suggests that Co9S8 could be synthesize from the waste materials and CO2. Moreover, Co9S8 could be employed as an effective catalyst in the environmental applications.",

SEM observations revealed more and more pleat-like wrinkles appeared on the surface of aramid, accompanied by the notable fiber swelling in the supercritical CO2-ionic liquid systems. In addition, XRD and TG analysis indicated that the crystallinity and the maximum decomposition temperatures of aramids were decreased gradually with ionic liquid treatment while those of aramids were increased with the temperature rising by adding ionic liquid in supercritical CO2. Overall, this proves to be an more effective and ecofriendly approach for aramid modification by supercritical CO2-ionic liquid systems.",

     "abstract": "Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is an important reaction to prepare syngas (CO and H2) and green hydrogen energy (H2) and to use two abundant greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4); the process is used in solar thermal-chemical storage and other kinds of high-temperature energy storage. However, the sintering and coking of the Ni-based catalysts represent two serious obstacles for the use of DRM in industrial applications. Herein, a novel core-shell catalyst with zirconia-modified nickel nanoparticles (NPs, Ni-ZrO2) as the cores and microporous silica as the shell (denoted as Ni-ZrO2@SiO2) was successfully designed and prepared via a one-pot facile strategy and used for the DRM reaction. The Ni-ZrO2@SiO2 catalyst showed the best time stability (240\u2009h) under harsh reaction conditions (pure CH4 and CO2 as a feed gas, 800\u2009\u00b0C, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)\u2009=\u200918,000\u2009ml gcat.\u22121\u2009h\u22121) among the recently reported core-shell structured DRM catalysts and most importantly, no coking occurred. The catalyst also efficiently inhibited the sintering of the Ni NPs and thus greatly improved the resistance to coking due to the modification of the ZrO2 providing abundance of activated oxygen (Ni and ZrO2 was highly dispersed with each other, therefore, much amount of Ni-ZrO2 interface and perimeter was formed) and the special core-shell structure. Thanks to its ultra-high anti-sintering ability and resistance to carbon deposition, the Ni-ZrO2@SiO2 catalyst might have great potential for industrial applications.",

     "abstract": "The conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals or fuels has attracted much attention over the past years. Plasma technology represents a highly promising alternative due to its non-equilibrium nature, deemed crucial for CO2 dissociation reactions. Gaining a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms involved under plasma conditions is essential to improve the performance of such processes. Among other theoretical calculations, plasma chemical kinetic modelling constitutes a very suitable approach to address this challenge. In this work, a zero-dimensional model of a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor is applied to CO2 splitting, providing a novel approach for including experimental parameters as discharge power and flow rate based on the analysis of the different scales involved. The model choices is extensively discussed as regards experimental parameters, cross-sectional data and the chemical reactions considered. The predictions of the model are in good agreement with existing experimental data and therefore the model is considered valid to analyse the CO2 splitting reaction mechanism based on its results. It is concluded that the electron impact dissociation is the dominant process towards CO2 conversion, which could explain the low energy efficiency achieved since only \u223c10% of the electron energy is consumed by mechanism. The remaining energy would be lost towards vibrational excitation not leading to CO2 dissociation in DBD reactors.",

However, methanol dimethyl ether and syngas have the lower value of lost hydrogen during the reaction, equal to 0.33, 0.25 and 0, respectively. Then, these compounds are analyzed in this review.

For the capture of carbon dioxide adsorption, absorption, membranes, cryogenic systems can be developed. An important role will have ionic liquids, under study by many researchers.

Pre and post-ERC analysis of the catalyst in different environment shows that same crystal facet is formed at the end of ERC, indicating that the crystal rearrangement occurred during ERC is independent of the environment and does not promote any particular reaction. Nanorods form intercalated layers with an extended surface giving maximum faradaic efficiency of 26% at a lower cell voltage of \u22122.75\u2009V. Dendrites forms porous layers, which are filled by the gas formed during ERC and thus decreases the active surface.

Element analysis by ICP-OES also revealed that the RG consists of three major constitutions: CaO (32.2%), SO3 (31.6%), and Fe2O3 (28.99%). To understand the reaction progress of RG in the carbonation process, the reaction model code PHREEQC-2.18 was found to be a very useful tool since it allows the exposure of all dissolved species of RG and presents its mineral phases at each time step. Furthermore, the mineral carbonation of RG delivered the reaction progress changes with Ca phases and, therefore, dissolved calcium (hydr)oxide starts to control the pH and the CO2 uptake.

This study invstigates the effect of barium (Ba) as a typical impurity on the carbonation characteristics of \u03b3-C2S. Results on the calcined \u03b3-C2S powders indicate that Ba doping has little effect on the crystal form of \u03b3-C2S, but substantially alters its morphology that is characterized by the increasing presence of wrinkles on the surface. Heat evolution during carbonation of the compacted \u03b3-C2S mortar mixtures shows the suppression of maximum temperature and the delay in reaching the peak in the very early age. This may be associated with the hindering of calcium dissociation as a result of the barium presence. The measured degree of carbonation and compressive strength development of the mortar samples are lower in the early stage but exceed the control in the later stage with a higher barium hydroxide (BH) doping amount. This can be attributed to the reduced thickness of moisture film coating the \u03b3-C2S particles. This retards the initial carbonation reaction, which may be beneficial for the penetration of CO2 into the sample interior, thus promoting the universal degree of carbonation in the long term. Analysis on the carbonation products reveals aragonite is the preferable metastable calcium carbonate at a low BH doping amount while vaterite is exclusively found as the metastable phase at a high BH amount.",

Numerous studies have used ZVI to stimulate the anaerobic digestion of waste and wastewater. Up to date however, little research has been done on the use of ZVI and anaerobic granular sludge for the conversion of CO2 as a sole carbon substrate to CH4. The results showed that 75\u2009g L\u22121 ZVI, 2 gVS L\u22121 anaerobic granular sludge at initial pH of 6 under daily pH regulation contributed to substantial CH4 production. It was pointed out that the initial ZVI (50\u2009g L\u22121), with anaerobic granular sludge, was sufficient for the production of the same amount of CH4 over 2 CO2 re-feedings for a total of 67 days. To identify the microbial pathways for CO2 conversion to CH4, the following inhibitors were independently added: antibiotics for bacteria inhibition, 2-Bromoethanesulphonate (BES) for methanogens inhibition and Trichloromethane (CHCl3) for inhibition of bacteria and methanogens. Results showed that when antibiotics were added, they did not have any negative effect on CO2 conversion to CH4. This demonstrates that CO2 is converted to CH4 mainly through hydrogenotrophic methanogens and the contribution of homoacetogens was minor. Under these conditions of anaerobic granular sludge and ZVI the addition of BES and CHCl3 resulted in a high generation of H2, no production of CH4 and generation of 1110\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121 and 730\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121 in 8 days respectively.",

More CO is generated for the pyrolysis of brown coal in CO2 than that in N2. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) experiments show that the pyrolysis of brown coal in CO2 is more exothermic than that in N2. This may indicate that the enhanced generation of CO is attributed to an enhanced thermal cracking induced by CO2. The more generation of CO for the reaction in CO2 (4.2\u2009mol.% at 700\u2009\u00b0C) than in N2 (0.5\u2009mol.% at 700\u2009\u00b0C) is a result of shifting carbon distribution from condensable hydrocarbons (e.g., tar) to CO.

The connectivity analysis is employed to rapidly approximate CO2 plume evolution through estimating the arrival time of CO2. This analysis uses the geostatistical realization of permeability fields as input. The geologic criteria algorithm is used to estimate the potential local capillary traps from a given capillary entry pressure field. This field, through the Leverett j-function, is correlated to the permeability field used in the connectivity analysis. We then quantify the total volume of local capillary traps identified within the capillary entry pressure field that can be filled during CO2 migration. We conduct several simulations in the reservoirs with different levels of heterogeneity under various injection scenarios. We demonstrate the reservoir heterogeneity affects the optimal injection rate in maximizing LCT during CO2 injection.

The effect of feed flow rate, applied voltage, arc current, and the addition of N2 or Ar on the reaction performance has been investigated. The results show two variation patterns of CO2 conversion and energy efficiency, depending on the specific energy input (SEI): In Pattern A with SEI\u2009>\u20093.5\u2009kJ/L, the CO2 conversion and energy efficiency decrease simultaneously with increasing SEI, while in Pattern B with SEI\u2009\u2264\u20093.5\u2009kJ/L, the energy efficiency and the CO2 conversion show an opposite trend. The recombination of CO and O at high temperatures could be responsible for the decrease of CO2 conversion with rising SEI due to the increased retention time or gas temperature. A CO2 conversion of 4.0-4.4% and energy efficiency of 16-17% can be achieved. Compared to other non-thermal plasmas, the RGA plasma exhibits a lower CO2 conversion but higher energy efficiency, whilst maintaining a flow rate (e.g, 6-7\u2009L/min) that is significantly higher than that of typical non-thermal plasmas (e.g., 20-125\u2009ml/min in dielectric barrier and corona discharges). Increasing the fraction of N2 or Ar promotes the conversion of CO2 but lowers the energy efficiency. N2 is clearly more beneficial for enhancing the CO2 conversion in comparison to Ar. Further enhancement of the reaction performance can be expected by cooling the plasma area to lower the gas temperature, to limit the recombination of CO and O.",

A coupled wellbore-reservoir system was simulated considering the flow of pure sCO2 in an injection well, the interaction of sCO2 and water in a permeable reservoir, and the flow of the two-phase mixture of sCO2 and water in a production well. Results of simulations indicate that this CO2 application is capable of providing a good source of renewable energy. It was found that for a reservoir with a 0.08\u2009km3 volume, about 8\u20139 MWth could be extracted in a steady state fashion for a 30-year lifetime operation. This is approximately equivalent to 100 MWth/km3. A sensitivity analysis provided information on the impact of certain parameters on the performance of the integrated system. The injection flowrate, the distance between the production and injection wellbores and the penetrating depth of the production wellbore into the reservoir have a first order impact on the pressure management of the reservoir. Additionally, CO2 injection temperature has a large effect on the thermosiphon characteristics of the system.",

The traditional methods require large organic solvent quantities and long processing times. Antisolvent fractionation with supercritical carbon dioxide offers intensified processing by drastically reducing the time requirement of the diastereomeric salt precipitation. A novel optical resolution of ibuprofen was developed and optimized with phenylglycinol as a resolving agent and gas antisolvent fractionation as the separation method. Above the critical values of certain operational parameters (carbon dioxide to methanol ratio, apparent diastereomeric salt concentration, equilibration time, the relative volume of the extracting fluid) the selectivity was roughly constant, the optical resolution is robust. The scalemic mixtures were purified by repeated resolution and enantiomeric purities above 99% were reached in three consecutive steps.",

     "abstract": "Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) is presently the most efficient fossil fuel power plant but with no carbon capture. The efficiency penalty resulting from the integration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is, however, a major challenge. The present study proposes an oxyfuel NGCC integrated with Chemical looping (CL) syngas production (OXY-CC-CL), for power generation with CCS. The chemical looping CO2/H2O dissociation would produce syngas (CO and H2 with methane reduction step in redox cycle) from recycled exhaust gas for additional power generation within the power plant. This integration of CL unit with the existing conventional oxy fuel power plant would be expected to decrease the efficiency penalty. Therefore, the thermodynamic (both energetic and exergetic), economic and environmental performance of the integrated chemical looping unit oxyfuel NGCC power plant with carbon capture were assessed. A 500\u2009MW scale plant was modelled and compared with a conventional NGCC and oxyfuel NGCC plant with carbon capture (OXY-CC). The net efficiency penalty of the proposed OXY-CC-CL unit was 4.2% compared to an efficiency penalty of 11.8% of the OXY-CC unit with a 100% carbon capture. The energetic efficiency obtained hence was 50.7%, together with an exergetic efficiency of 47.1%. Heat integration via pinch analysis revealed the possibility to increase the system energetic efficiency up to 61%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify relative impacts of system operational parameters. The specific capital cost of the proposed OXY-CC-CL was obtained as 2455 $/kW, with a corresponding LCOE of 128 $/MWh without carbon credits.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this work was to study the efficiency of a fluidized plasma reactor (FPR) coupled to a photovoltaic system to reduce CO2 to CO at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures. The major products of this reaction were CO and O2, which suggests that the stoichiometric conversion of CO2 into CO and O2 was achieved. The results indicate that increasing the number of discharge points in the anode, voltage and frequency, the conversion of CO2 to CO increased due to the a higher number of random non-thermal plasma (NTP) discharges generated in the FPR. An increase of the gap between the electrodes resulted also in higher conversions. At higher CO2 flowrate, the CO2 conversion decreased but the energy efficiency increased. The addition of low concentration of copper in the alumina fluidized bed resulted in a slight improvement of the CO2 conversion and energy efficiency. The maximum CO2 conversion and energy efficiency obtained in this study were 41% and 2.1% respectively. From a life cycle assessment approach, it was concluded that the use of photovoltaic energy coupled to the FPR technology improve the sustainability of the process. It was estimated that with the optimal conditions obtained in this work, it would be possible to compensate 67% of the CO2 emissions associated to the process.",

The miscibility and molecular interaction between PES and Extem for blend compositions 80/20, 50/50 and 20/80\u2009w/w were evaluated. Differential Scanning Calorimetry showed that of all the blend compositions, only the 20/80 blend is miscible as a single glass transition temperature was observed, lying between the glass transition temperatures of PES and Extem. FTIR spectra revealed shifts in functional group frequencies of the polymer blends, suggesting inter-molecular interactions between the polymer chains of Extem and PES. XRD patterns of the 20/80 blend showed a much lower characteristic peak intensity compared to other blend compositions, which indicates strong inter-molecular interactions. The density of the polymer blends was lower than that of the pure polymers, which is related to a decrease in fractional free volume. The separation performance of membranes synthesized with these blends was investigated for a gas mixture containing 15% vol. CO2. Blend membranes were limited by the tradeoff between permeability and selectivity, except for the 20/80 blend, which interstingly had a permeability and selectivity more than threefold that of other membranes, as the values hovered around the Robeson\u2019s upper bound. The miscibility of Extem/PES therefore resulted in a new polymer material, which is a potential candidate for carbon capture applications.",

A porous network dominated by \u223c40\u201346% of ultramicropores below 0.5\u202fnm and no significant presence of pores above 0.7\u202fnm boosts the CO2 uptake at 1\u202fbar and 298\u202fK around 40% compared to materials with similar micropore volume. A slight ultramicropore widening causes the drop to a standard pattern that depends mainly on the micropore volume.The detailed analysis of the CO2 isotherms within the Dubinin\u00b4s theory provides simple clues for the optimization of carbons for CO2 capture at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Thus, a general pattern of around 7.2\u202fmmol of CO2 captured per cm3 of ultramicropores is found for a variety of activated carbons and carbide derived-carbons with characteristic energy Eo of 29\u201322\u202fkJ/mol.

Three pathways, including CO2 dissociation into CO* followed by CO* hydrogenation, CO2 reduction through the HCOO* and COOH* intermediates, were analyzed based on the results from the density functional theory calculations. The results indicate that the presence of Re significantly lowers the activation barrier of CO bond cleavage due to the strong affinity of Re to O but has no significant effect on the hydrogenation steps. Microkinetic analysis showed that the presence of Re greatly increases the selectivity toward CH4. Analysis of surface coverage of the adsorbed species showed that CO* and H* were the most abundant species on the Ni(111) surface whereas appreciable amount of O adatoms were present on Re@Ni(111) in addition to CO* and H*, with the O adatoms on the Re sites. On both surfaces, increasing H2 partial pressure resulted in an increase in H* coverage but decreased CO* coverage.

The macro-microporous structure is achieved by the incorporation of microporous, biomass-derived activated carbon particles in the liquid foam enclosed by a cationic surfactant as stabilizer. This method yields crack-free monoliths (solid foams) with a compressive strength of the order of 20\u202fkPa. The microstructure and the textural properties of the final solid foams have been investigated by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and gas adsorption. The behavior as selective CO2 adsorbents at 25\u202f\u00b0C has been evaluated using breakthrough experiments under simulated post-combustion conditions (16% V/V CO2/N2), resulting in a selectivity factor of 13 over N2.

The Ce/Zr co-doped catalyst, possessing a molar ratio of 0.01:0.01, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and long-term stability.",

The absorption of the gas from the slug results in a shrinking of the slug as it moves along the channel. The rate of decrease of slug size and slug velocity are used to quantify the mass transfer rate. A lumped parameter model is developed to study the dissolution dynamics of CO2 slugs in the aqueous solution. The experimental data in this controlled study and the model developed are used to predict the liquid side volumetric mass transfer coefficient. The enhancement of mass transfer due to chemical reaction in the liquid phase is also quantified. The effect of various parameters like gas and liquid flow rates, concentration of NaOH on system behaviour is examined. An empirical correlation for dimensionless mass transfer coefficient is obtained from the experimental data which can be used to design absorption columns.",

     "abstract": "Carbonation of lime (CaO) using ethanol is studied for direct atmospheric CO2 capture. The parameters that control the carbonation of lime using air and ethanol are determined, and operational conditions that enhance the CO2 uptake are investigated. A mixture of lime and ethanol was exposed to air within a fume hood, allowing ethanol evaporation for a defined period. Results reveal that the carbonation occurs after ethanol has evaporated, when the remaining powder is exposed to the atmosphere. After contact with ethanol, the CO2 uptake of lime is enhanced because the specific surface area of the powder increases. Increasing the time of exposure to the atmosphere results in an increase in the carbonation conversion (from 0.03\u202fgCO2/gCaO for 1 day of exposure, up to 0.44\u202fgCO2/gCaO for 60 days of exposure). Milling the solvent-lime slurry, before exposing it to the atmosphere, also enhances the carbonation yield through the effect of size reduction and mechanical activation (from 0.30\u202fgCO2/gCaO with 5\u202fmin of pre-milling, to 0.60\u202fgCO2/gCaO with 10\u202fmin of pre-milling). Another way to increase the carbonation yield is through the use of alkaline wastewater. Combining the wastewater with ethanol, or milling a slurry of CaO/wastewater before exposure to the atmosphere, increases the carbonation yield further to 90.2% (0.70\u202fgCO2/gCaO) and 96.2% (0.75\u202fgCO2/gCaO), respectively. This study reveals that ethanol/alkaline wastewater treatments, along with their different enhancement options, represent an effective viable route for sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere, which could be applied to pure lime or potentially to lime-containing wastes.",

To address this issue and provide an ultra-fast solution, here, we use machine learning as a powerful data-mining strategy to predict the CO2 solubility, density and viscosity of potassium lysinate (PL) and its blended solutions with monoethanolamine (MEA), with totally 433 data groups extracted from previous experimental literatures. Specifically, we compared the predictive performances of back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and general regression neural network (GRNN). Results show that for BPNN with only one hidden layer and a small number of hidden neurons could provide good predictive performance for CO2 solubility and aqueous solution viscosity, while a GRNN could perform better for the prediction of aqueous solution density. Finally, it is concluded that such a machine learning based predictive framework could help to provide an ultra-fast prediction for CO2-related thermodynamic properties in solution environment.",

     "abstract": "Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the facet effect on CO2 adsorption, dissociation and hydrogenation over Fe catalysts. The energetically most stable configurations of CO2 and H2 adsorption over different Fe facets were identified from which we observed that CO2 adsorption on Fe(211) and Fe(111) is much stronger than other facets, indicating more sufficient activation of CO2 on these two surfaces. CO2 adsorption stability was found to be impacted by the surface coverage of H* on these Fe facets, showing that when surface H* coverage exceeds to certain percentage, CO2 adsorption is largely weakened whilst the electrons transfer from the Fe surface to CO2 becomes decreased. These results suggest that an appropriate H2-CO2 co-adsorption equilibrium is important for effective activation of reactants. Based on the examination of CO2 dissociation and hydrogenation on these Fe facets, the Fe(111) is potentially the most active facet for CO2 conversion due to a lower barrier for HCOO* formation via CO2 hydrogenation while this facet is also catalytically more active for activating CO2. Fe(110) and Fe(100) exhibit more facile ability to dissociate CO2 to CO* while kinetically competitive formation of CO* and HCOO* was observed over Fe(211). The present work demonstrates that the facet of Fe catalysts can impact the molecular adsorption, activation and conversion path in CO2 hydrogenation and thus can alter the product selectivity.",

The surface basicity and hydrophilic character expressed in terms of retention capacity of CO2 (CRC) and moisture (WRC) were assessed through thermal programmed desorption. The CRC was found to increase with increasing polyaniline content. CO2 appears to adsorb via both physical and chemical interactions on three types of sites. The weak sites are due to physical interactions between H2O and CO2 molecules, while the strong sites are expressed by chemical interactions between CO2 molecules and the amine moiety incorporated. Repetitive TPD patterns showed a progressive CRC decrease due to the removal of water molecules that contribute significantly to CO2 retention.",

This is as yet poorly understood in the field. The authors conducted a series of tri-axial strength tests on Hawkesbury sandstone under in-situ stress and temperature conditions to characterise the behaviour of reservoir rock upon exposure to super-critical CO2 (ScCO2) to determine this chemically-coupled mechanical behaviour.According to the findings, injection of CO2 into a brine-saturated reservoir rock mass may cause a considerable strength reduction, probably due to the rock\u2019s mineralogical alteration-induced mechanical weakening of grain contacts. This was confirmed by SEM analysis, according to which the mineral dissolution process upon exposure to ScCO2 is significant, and considerable quartz and calcite dissolution were noticed in the tested samples. Importantly, this rock mineral dissolution may alter the reservoir\u2019s natural pore geometry. This eventually affects the effective stress patterns acting on the rock matrix. In addition, the slip tendency of brine+CO2-reacted reservoir rock is increased with increasing injection pressure, revealing the fate of the resulting pore pressure-dominant effective stress field through the CO2 injection process. The results were then incorporated in the effective stress field model. This model can be used to predict the possibility of mechanical failure of reservoir rock upon CO2 injection into saline aquifers.",

Results were compared with the obtained for a commercial Ni/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst and all samples were tested both under thermal and non-thermal DBD plasma conditions. It was found that a higher Si/Al ratio led to better performances not only under thermal but, especially, under plasma conditions, which was attributed to the lower affinity of this sample to water and, thus, to a decrease in the inhibitory role of this compound in Sabatier reaction. Furthermore, the addition of Ce as promoter favoured the dielectric properties of the materials and gave additional sites for CO2 activation leading to much better results than the obtained for a commercial Ni/\u03b3-Al2O3 sample and for the Ni/zeolite, especially under plasma conditions. Indeed, the best zeolite of this work (NiCe/Zeolite) reported a CH4 yield of 75% with a power supply of 25\u202fW while, under the same conditions, the commercial sample and the un-promoted Ni/Zeolite presented just 23% and 15%, CH4 yield, respectively.

Two series of silica supports with distinct morphology, i.e. granular and microspherical, available from PQ-Corp., and well defined surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume were loaded with branched PEI. The CO2 adsorption characteristics of these adsorbents were measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The increase in PEI loading on the porous silica caused a significant decrease in surface area and pore volume. At a certain loading level, the pores were completely filled with PEI, and the CO2 diffusion was hindered resulting in lower adsorption capacity and amine efficiency. With granular silicas, supports having an average pore diameter greater than about 240\u202f\u00c5 performed best. However, once this threshold in pore diameter was passed, the adsorption capacity did not improve much further. For microspherical silica supports this threshold was around 300\u202f\u00c5. For supports with a same pore volume, the ones with a larger pore diameter had higher CO2 adsorption capacity, even if their surface area was lower.

Water removal increases the CH4 yield but only up to an optimum R; above this value, coke formation is favoured. This optimum value depends on the temperature, pressure, CH4/CO2 ratio and was always below 0.99. The highest improvements on CH4 yield were achieved for the lowest CH4/CO2 ratio considered.

It is found that neutrally charged g-C10N9 membrane is non-selective for CO2/N2 separation resulting from its large pore size. However, positively charged g-C10N9 membrane with charge density of 88\u202f\u00d7\u202f1013 e/cm2 exhibits 100% N2/CO2 selectivity, and the CO2/N2 selectivity of negatively charged g-C10N9 membrane with charge density of -60\u202f\u00d7\u202f1013 e/cm2 is more than four times higher than that of neutrally charged g-C10N9 membrane. Furthermore, it is shown that the CO2/N2 separation performance of charged g-C10N9 membrane is influenced by the number of CO2 molecules blocking at the pores and the binding energy between CO2 molecules and charged g-C10N9 membrane, which are determined by positive or negative membrane charge and charge density. Our results manifest that charge control is an excellent method for g-C10N9 membrane to realize switchable CO2/N2 separation.",

     "abstract": "A five-membered cyclic carbonate as CO2-sourced monomer was prepared from ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) with CO2 by cycloaddition reaction, abbreviated as 5CC-EGDE, at 130 \u2103 under 10\u202fbar CO2 pressure in the presence of quaternary ammonium salt modified amberlyst (D296) for 20\u202fh. The complete conversion and 98.6% selectivity were obtained, respectively. The incorporation of 5CC-EGDE into epoxy resin could reduce the viscosity during preparation process and improve the toughness effectively. It was ascribed to the ring-opening reaction of 5CC-EGDE with curing agent, and hydrogen bonding, formed between urethane groups and other polar groups. Besides, the low crosslinking density and unreacted carbonate groups remaining in epoxy network were beneficial to the movement of molecular chains and dissipation of energy during deformation process. In addition, effects of hydrogen-bonding interactions and crosslinking density on mechanical performances were also investigated by varying EGDE conversion and amount of added curing agent, respectively. The results indicated that mechanical performances of epoxy resin were promoted by combined effects of urethane linkage, hydrogen bonding, low crosslinking density and unreacted carbonate groups.",

     "abstract": "In this study, two thermodynamic approaches, namely explicit model and modified Kent-Eisenberg model are presented for the accurate determination of carbon dioxide solubility in aqueous solutions of amino acid salts with different levels of complexity. Both models were further extended to the correlation of carbon dioxide solubility in aqueous blends of amino acid salts with alkanolamines. Firstly, the explicit model consists of a single mathematical equation. Its structure is computationally simple and derived from equilibrium thermodynamics theory. Secondly, the modified Kent-Eisenberg model utilizes detailed reaction mechanism for development of a polynomial equation, that is solved by combining all non-idealities in two correction factors. Both models suitably determined the thermodynamics of carbon dioxide loaded aqueous amino acid salt solutions and their blends with alkanolamines. The results were in good agreement with experimental data for representative amino acid salt solutions (potassium and/or sodium salts of lysine, glycine, proline, sarcosine, serine, threonine, alanine, phenylalanine, amino-butyric acid, glutamine and asparagine) and their blends with alkanolamines (2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and piperazine) for range of process parameters. For carbon dioxide solubility in aqueous amino acid salt solutions, the AARE% for explicit and modified Kent-Eisenberg model was 13.85% and 13.84%, respectively. For carbon dioxide solubility in aqueous blends of amino acid salt and alkanolamine solutions, the AARE% for explicit and modified Kent-Eisenberg model was 18.25% and 17.25%, respectively. Both models use a small number of adjustable parameters. This indicates that generated parameters are able to accurately predict the carbon dioxide solubility at other process conditions, with minimum computational intricacy.",

     "abstract": "Utilization of CO2 through the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising solution in managing greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we used the RWGS reaction to evaluate the catalytic conversion of CO2 over Ru-Fe nanoparticles supported on samarium-doped ceria (SDC) support. Catalysts of different RuxFe100-x compositions (x\u202f=\u202f100, 80, 45, 20, 0\u202fat.%) have been studied under steady-state conditions in a packed bed reactor in the temperature range 300\u2013800\u202f\u00b0C to determine their catalytic activity and selectivity towards CO. The metal-support interaction (MSI) effect for SDC was evaluated to determine its promotional behavior for the RWGS reaction. The catalyst was characterized using TEM, TGA, and ICP-ES techniques. Among all investigated catalysts, Ru45Fe55/SDC (2\u202fwt.%) displayed the overall best activity and CO selectivity. A stability test of 100\u202fh at 650\u202f\u00b0C confirmed an excellent stability of the Ru45Fe55/SDC catalyst. Overall, the use of Ru45Fe55/SDC (2\u202fwt.%) is a promising catalyst in the utilization of CO2, reaching a maximum CO yield of \u223c47.5% at 800\u202f\u00b0C and 100% CO selectivity above 500\u202f\u00b0C.

Contrary to carbon support, all catalysts containing oxygen conducting-ceramic supports displayed 100% selectivity to CO at temperatures above 600\u202f\u00b0C, which can be attributed to the synergistic relationship between Ru-Fe nanoparticles being promoted through the MSI and thermally induced migration of promoting ionic species (O\u03b4\u2212) from oxygen conducting ceramics to the nanoparticles.",

The crystallite structure, texture property, morphology, redox and acid-base properties and the surface chemical situation of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, TEM, H2-TPR, NH3/CO2-TPD and XPS. The possible activation routes of CO2 and glycerol were analyzed with DRIFTS and FTIR. ZnWO4-ZnO composite catalysts showed better catalytic performances with respect to ZnO in the carbonylation of glycerol with CO2. The improved activity of ZnWO4-ZnO catalysts was associated with the formation of ZnWO4, the interaction between ZnWO4 and ZnO, and the enhanced moderate acidic property. DIRFTS results showed that chelating bidentate carbonate species was the main adsorption pattern for CO2 on ZnO, while the introduction of W led to the bridged bidentate carbonate, which became the main adsorption pattern on ZnWO4-ZnO. As for the activation of glycerol, zinc glycerolate played an important role in the reaction process. Based on the reaction and characterization results, a plausible reaction route involved a seven-membered ring esters intermediate was suggested for the reaction of CO2 and glycerol over ZnWO4-ZnO catalysts.",

Activated carbon was synthesized by carbonization of peanut-shaped packaging waste followed by chemical activation using KOH at a ratio of one to four. The activated carbon was characterized for it is textural properties using N2 adsorption at 77\u202fK, and carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms at 273, 298 and 323\u202fK. Non-Linear Density Functional Theory (NDLFT) was applied to carbon dioxide isotherm at 273\u202fK to characterize narrow micropores and microporous structure of activated carbon. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate morphology and microstructure. TEM micrographs confirmed the existence of random micropores. We have also noticed that the textural properties were highly dependent on the concentration of the activating agent. Carbon dioxide adsorption on activated carbon materials has shown dependency on the volume of narrow micropores (less than 0.8\u202fnm). The activated carbon materials have narrow micropore volume in a range of 0.155\u20130.292 cm3, and BET surface area of 761\u20131383 m2/g.

Process description of ESA cycle, including feed, electrification, electrification with purge and cooling, is presented via the adsorption isotherm diagram. By the theory of thermodynamic carbon pump, sensitivity analysis of cycle parameters is evaluated in terms of the second-law efficiency (Eff2nd) and the electrical heating efficiency (Effele).

Among the three adsorbents, Eff2nd of ACHM is the lowest one compared to the others. Similarly, Effele of the combination with brass is superior to that of the groups with aluminum.

TGA study showed that sorbent adsorption capacities increased by 122\u2013153% with CO2 concentrations (5\u201380%) in the gas at 50/75\u202f\u00b0C. The DRIFTS studies indicate that low amine loaded sorbents exhibit higher uptakes with an increase in CO2 concentrations which is attributed to the mode of CO2 adsorption i.e. 1:1 CO2 to amine forming carbamic acid. At higher amine loadings CO2 is adsorbed following the 1:2 CO2 to amine forming carbamate-ammonium ions pair resulting in lower adsorption capacities per amine site. The studies also showed an increase in carbamic acid formation with pressure from 100 to 500\u202fkPa at low amine loadings and both carbamic acid and carbamates at higher amine loadings.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared anodes demonstrate the layers doped on Ti plates exist in tetragonal phase of IrO2 and \u03b2-PbO2 crystals with dendritic and pyramid shapes, respectively, benefiting to increasing anode area in water electrolysis. The electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV), polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) performed in Na2SO4 solution indicate the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode possesses higher oxygen evolution activity compared with those of Pt and \u03b2-PbO2/Ti ones; this is because of its excellent abilities in enlarging electrode area, decreasing oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and increasing oxidation kinetics for water decomposition, which effectively enhances the CO2 reduction. The faradic and energy efficiencies of IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode are 40.2% and 27.4%, raising by ratios of 7.2%, 81.1% and 12.8%, 242.5% to those of Pt and \u03b2-PbO2/Ti, respectively, at applied current of 0.3\u202fA and reaction time of 24\u202fh during formate production.

     "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that catalyzes the carbon dioxide (CO2) hydration, has been suggested as a potentially powerful agent for CO2 capture and utilization. For successful application, CA should withstand the harsh environment presented by CO2-capturing facilities. While there have been intensive efforts to identify and engineer thermostable CAs, other required conditions such as the high salt concentration of CO2 absorbents have often been ignored. Herein, we expressed, purified, and characterized a novel \u03b1-type CA (hmCA) possessing an unusual N-terminal extension from the halophilic marine bacterium Hydrogenovibrio marinus. We found that the N-terminal extension strongly influenced the enzyme solubility. Recombinant hmCA showed catalytic efficiency comparable to other bacterial \u03b1-type CAs. hmCA was less inhibited by anionic inhibitors showing 1.6- (NO3\u2212), 3.1- (NO2\u2212), and 3.7-fold (Cl\u2212) higher inhibition constants than those of mesophilic bovine CA (bCA), suggesting halotolerance. Recombinant hmCA was markedly stabilized using most of the alkali metal salts tested, showing 19\u202f\u00b0C higher melting temperature at 1\u202fM NaCl compared to bCA that was significantly destabilized. The region of N-terminal extension seemed not to be involved in halotolerance. The remarkable halotolerance may be attributed to the uneven distribution of electrostatic potential and the localized negative charge on the hmCA surface. hmCA displayed \u223c29-fold longer half-life than that of bCA at 40\u202f\u00b0C in potassium carbonate as a practical absorbent, suggesting that halotolerance should be considered another key characteristic in the development of biocatalysts for CO2 capture using high-salt-containing CO2 absorbents.",

These levels decreased in the order: CoAl/MgAl2O4\u202f>\u202fCoAl/Al2O3\u202f>\u202fCoAl/ZrO2\u202f>\u202fCoAl/CeO2\u202f>\u202fCoAl/SiO2. Due to the proximity of the Co and Mg ionic radii, the cobalt species strongly interacted with MgAl2O4 resulting in the formation of a solid solution. The CH4/CO2 thermogravimetric results indicated that the performance of the CoAl/MgAl2O4 catalyst was superior to that of the other catalysts. This was attributed to the balance between the rates of carbon deposition from CH4 decomposition and surface oxidation from CO2 dissociation. In addition, the apparent activation energy on this catalyst (54.6\u202fkJ/mol) was much lower than that of CoAl/Al2O3 (77.5\u202fkJ/mol), indicating a marked improvement in CH4 reforming activity for CoAl/MgAl2O4. Overall, the characterization results revealed that the catalytic performance was influenced by the synergistic effect between CoAl and its support.",

The physicochemical characteristics of biochar significantly changed with the types of C precursor and flow gas stream. The biochar from pyrolysis of SCG under N2 gas stream showed good dispersion of Co nanoparticles (10\u201320\u202fnm) in carbon matrix as compared to that produced under CO2 stream, but BET surface area was very small (4.5 m2 g\u22121) due to pore blockage by thermal degradation products. SCG-derived biochar formed in the presence of CO2 possessed highly porous structure due to CO2-assisted C volatilization. In contrast, for glucose-derived biochar, significant reduction in porosity of biochar occurred with excess devolatilization of C under CO2 conditions, while the pyrolysis under N2 flow produced porous biochar. These contrasting results demonstrated the significance of structure crystallinity and thermal degradability of C precursors. The catalytic performance of biochar was better correlated with the external surface area rather than microporosity.",

A generalized machine learning input representation method was applied, for the first time, by quantifying the types and concentrations of the blended solutions.

To consider the applicability of CO2 emulsion in fields such as submarine hydrate exploitation and CO2 sequestration, the performance of surfactants in saline solution was examined.

Notably, the CO2 mineralization process is able to utilize flue gas with a low concentration of CO2 that has not been subjected to CO2 capture processes. For the technical feasibility analysis of the CO2 mineralization process examined in the study, performance evaluation is conducted for a bench-scale CO2 mineralization test unit (2\u202fkg/day CO2 utilization capacity), yielding sodium bicarbonate of over 97% purity. It is also estimated that the CO2 utilization process of this study produces 0.65\u202ftons of CO2 emissions per ton of sodium bicarbonate produced, which indicates a 2.09\u202fton CO2 reduction compared to the conventional processes which produce 2.74\u202ftons of CO2 emissions for the same amount of sodium bicarbonate production. With these results as a basis, an economic evaluation is conducted for a commercial-scale CO2 utilization plant (sodium bicarbonate production capacity: approximately 5000\u202ftons/year) which utilizes CO2 in flue gas produced from thermal power plants. The evaluation supports the economic feasibility of the process with a benefit/cost ratio (B/C ratio) of 1.12 and internal rate of return (IRR) of 10.4%.",

Consequently, the self-regenerative FM-0.2 with internal reaction possesses a 2.2 times higher CO yield as compared with that of FM-0.5.

     "abstract": "This work addresses the solar-driven thermochemical production of CO and O2 from two-step CO2-splitting cycles, using both ceria granules prepared from cork templates (CG) and ceria foams from polyurethane templates (CF). These materials were cycled in a high-temperature indirectly-irradiated solar tubular reactor using a temperature-swing process. Samples were typically reduced at 1400\u202f\u00b0C using concentrated solar power as a heating source and subsequently oxidised with CO2 between 1000\u20131200\u202f\u00b0C. On average, CO production yields for CG were two times higher than for CF, indicating that the morphology of this three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3-DOM) CeO2 improves the reaction kinetics. Their performance stability was demonstrated by conducting 11 cycles under solar irradiation conditions. Slightly increasing the reduction temperature strongly enhanced the reduction extent, and thus the CO production yield (reaching about 0.2\u202fmmol g\u22121 after reduction at 1450\u202f\u00b0C in inert gas), while decreasing the oxidation temperature mainly improved the CO production rate (up to 1.43\u202f\u03bcmol s\u22121 g\u22121 at 1000\u202f\u00b0C). Characterisation of the 3-DOM structure, by means of XRD and SEM, provided insights into the reactivity behaviour of the developed materials. The pre-sintered ceria granules retained their structure after cycling. The fact that the mean cell size of CG is smaller (at least one order of magnitude) than that of CF suggests that its exposed surfaces enhanced reaction rates by a factor of two. Moreover, the maximum fuel production rate of CG was roughly three times greater than that reported previously for a ceria reticulated porous foam with dual-scale porosity.",

To address the problem, experiments and specimens were designed based on Orthogonal Experimental Design (OED) to investigate the influential factors, including jet pressure (Pin), jet distance (S), nozzle diameter (dn), perforation length (L) and perforation diameter (dperf). In addition, the evaluation indexes, ambient pressure and the fracture profile were deeply discussed. The investigation results indicated that crack initiation on the root of perforation was prevented by the higher SC-CO2 jet pressure. Particularly, when the nozzle diameter was more than the inlet diameter of casing (3\u202fmm), the crack number on perforation dropped sharply. When the optimal perforation length and perforation diameter were respectively 50\u202fmm and 6\u202fmm, the peak values of the crack number and distribution range were observed. The results of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that jet pressure and perforation length were the main influential parameters.

Thus, it is a promising alternative to hydraulic fracturing for enhancing the production of low-permeability hydrocarbon reservoirs. In this study, a new numerical model for predicting the wellbore temperature and pressure during supercritical CO2 fracturing was established based on thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and a numerical solution method. In the new model, the physical properties of CO2 are calculated with the Span\u2013Wagner and Vesovic models, and the heat generated by fluid friction losses is absorbed by the tubing and CO2 according to the contact coefficient. The model was used to examine the influences of the injection rate and temperature on the wellbore pressure and temperature. The results indicated that both the heat transfer and pressure in the wellbore are transient processes in the initial stage of injection; as the injection time increases, the heat transfer and pressure in the wellbore can be considered steady processes. The CO2 temperature in the wellbore is considerably affected by both the injection temperature and rate, whereas the wellbore pressure is greatly affected by the injection rate but weakly affected by the injection temperature. The CO2 pressure in the wellbore decreases rapidly as the well depth increases because of high fluid frictional resistance, so a drag reducer suitable for liquid CO2 needs to be developed.",

     "abstract": "The utilisation of coal as fuel for the production of energy will grow parallel with the increase of the cost of oil in the next years. This paper aims to investigate the integration between two clean coal technologies: Calcium Looping (CaL) process and Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) in order to produce a high CO2 concentrated stream.The main goal of this work is to find out the optimum working point of a system using CaL and MCFC technologies, coupled together, to produce decarbonised energy from coal as a primary energy source. The integrated system of CaL with MCFC presented in this paper, is fed with a raw syngas coming from coal gasification [1]. The raw syngas is decarbonised using calcium oxide as solid sorbent in the first reactor of CaL (carbonator), subsequently the clean syngas flowing out of the carbonator is used as anodic fuel for an MCFC. The thermal regeneration of solid sorbents occurs burning methane with air producing a CO2 reach gas, that feeds the cathodic compartment of MCFC.This configuration allows to concentrate the CO2 from cathode side to anode side of the MCFC, using internal electrochemical reactions of the cell, producing electric power at the same time.This work has been structured to tackle the coupling of CaL with MCFC using a combined numerical and experimental approach. Thus the investigation of the possible integration has been carried out starting with a lumped model simulating the whole calcium looping process. The model was used to investigate the behaviour of the CaL system when varying the amount of solid sorbent used in the process.Data coming from the model in terms of gas composition flowing out from CaL reactors were subsequently validated experimentally simulating different operating conditions in a MCFC single cell (81\u202fcm2). Performance of the MCFC was monitored with polarisation curves and power density curves, aiming to integrate experimentally the electric behaviour of the whole system, in order to have a first validation of the two systems working together.",

     "abstract": "Due to its great potential of energy consumption saving, the biphasic solvent has attracted more and more attention. In the present work, an efficient absorbent of amino-functionalized ionic liquids (AFILs) was dissolved in ethanol-water solvent to form a novel biphasic solvent for CO2 capture. When the concentration of triethylenetetramine l-lysine ([TETAH][Lys]) was 0.5\u202fmol/L and the volume ratio of ethanol-water solvent was 4:6, the [TETAH][Lys] solution separated into two phases after CO2 absorption. Under the optimal conditions, the volume of the CO2-rich phase was about one third of the total volume of the mixture, which meant that only one third of the solution needed to be regenerated and the energy consumption could be greatly reduced. Meanwhile, the loading of the CO2-rich phase contributed about 93% of the total loading of the solution, and its viscosity was only 27.95\u202fmPa\u202fs. The regeneration efficiency of the solvent after the 5th absorption-desorption cycle still kept at 91.3%. Based on the experimental and 13C NMR analysis results, the reaction and phase change mechanisms of CO2 capture into the [TETAH][Lys]-ethanol-water solution were clarified. CO2 absorption into [TETAH][Lys] firstly formed carbamate, which would further hydrolyze to HCO3\u2212/CO32\u2212 and react with ethanol to form the ethyl carbonate. Due to the limited solubility of these absorption products in ethanol, as well as the good solubility in H2O, the products transferred to the lower phase while the ethanol stayed in the upper phase in the biphasic system.",

     "abstract": "This study explores a novel beneficial utilization of CO2 in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) based concrete. In existing studies, CO2 is mainly added into concrete through accelerated carbonation of fresh or hardened concrete, which is limited by the low diffusion of CO2 into the concrete. In addition, a high CO2 concentrated environment is needed to carbonate the concrete, making the existing methods only applicable to pre-cast concrete. Aiming to eliminate these limitations in the existing methods, this study proposes to directly add gaseous CO2 into fresh concrete mix as an admixture through a two-step mixing approach, pre-carbonation method. In this method, CO2 is first absorbed into a slurry of calcium-rich cementitious material in the first step, and then blended with the rest ingredients to produce concrete in the second step. This method can in-situ produce nano to sub-micro CaCO3 particles in fresh concrete, providing extra heterogenous nucleation sites for the hydration of OPC. Therefore, the hydration of OPC can be greatly improved, as evidenced by the calorimetry testing result. The addition of CO2 also produces more ettringite in the produced mortar, as revealed by X-Ray Diffraction and Thermogravimetric analysis. As a result, the overall volume of the hydration products of the OPC is increased, leading to denser microstructure of the mortar samples. For these reasons, the compressive strength of the cement mortar samples can be significantly improved by the proposed method.",

Furthermore, the performance evaluation of BOFS applied as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and a cost and benefits analysis of the whole process was conducted. The results indicated the feasibility of the integrated system to industrial solid waste, sewage, and exhaust treatments and the maximum achievable carbonation conversion of BOFS was approximately 60.9% with R2 of 0.958\u20130.982. A high level of calcium ion and the alkaline solution hindered the leaching of calcium ion from BOFS, whereas sodium ion was absorbed by BOFS simultaneously. The properties of the cement that used BOFS as SCMs met ASTM requirements. The suggested substitution ratios for fresh and carbonated BOFS in cement mortars were 15% and 10%, respectively.

The effect of Sn and Pt as promoters of Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 was also investigated. The formulation promoted with Sn looked especially promising, showing CO2 conversions stabilising at 65% after highs of 95%. Its increased performance is attributed to the additional dispersion Sn promotion causes. Changes in the reaction conditions (space velocity and temperature) cement this idea, with the Ni-Sn/CeAl material performing superiorly to the mono-metallic material, showing less deactivation. However, in the long run it is noted that the mono-metallic Ni/CeAl performs better. As such the application is key when deciding which catalyst to employ in the dry reforming process.",

The sphericity and interconnected six-membered-ring (6-MR) pore porosity of ZIF-8 was controlled through an aqueous synthetic process by using a non-ionic surfactant (Pluronics, P123) and deionized water as solvent. The use of surfactant in ZIF-8 synthesis resulted in blunt nanocrystals with increased sphericity and 6-MR pore volume as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm measurements. Subsequent pure gas permeation tests showed that blunt ZIF-8 increased CO2/N2 separation performance through \u201cideal morphology\u201d in MMMs as a result of the excellent dispersion of ZIF-8 and good ZIF-8-polymer interfacial adhesion within the polymer matrix.

Further, the impact of an upstream cold bed on the temperature distribution in the catalytic bed was investigated. It was found that the cold bed was able to remove the heat of reaction efficiently to prolong an overheating of the catalyst bed. Thermography was also used to study a dynamic phenomenon, namely the in situ sulfur poisoning of a nickel-alumina catalyst. The temperature of the fixed bed was thereby spatially resolved at any point in time during the reaction. It was found that poisoning causes the reactive zone to move through the catalytic bed at a constant velocity. A simple poisoning model was applied to correlate the observed moving velocity to the catalyst's specific active surface area as determined by static H2 chemisorption at room temperature.",

These new highly stable catalysts were easily prepared by reaction of tetramethylurea in the presence of oxalyl chloride with aminomethyl polyphenylenes. The TMG-functionalized polyphenylene (2PhCH2TMG) prepared from a pre-functionalized network was efficient and competitive compared with other reported catalysts achieving high epoxides conversion (>90%) and 100% selectivity towards the corresponding cyclic carbonates. The catalyst was easily separated from the reaction media and reused after basic regeneration without loss of activity.",

     "abstract": "The sorption kinetics and capacities of CO2 and H2O were investigated for two different potassium-promoted hydrotalcite sorbents and potassium-promoted alumina. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and packed-bed reactor (PBR) breakthrough experiments were performed using sequences of adsorption and desorption steps in different gas mixtures containing CO2 and H2O. Experiments were carried out at an operating temperature of 400\u202f\u00b0C with different partial pressures ranging from 0.025\u202fbar to 0.3\u202fbar for CO2 and 0.1 to 0.3\u202fbar for H2O respectively. It was found that a sorption mechanism with different adsorption sites, developed for one of the sorbents, also applies for the other sorbents where capacities are different and depending on the sorbent. From experimental results it was deduced that K2CO3 promotion is mainly responsible for a reactive CO2 adsorption site, which can only be regenerated with steam. The adsorption capacity for this site is enhanced for K2CO3 promoted alumina compared to K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcite. A second adsorption site for CO2, which can be regenerated with N2 is dominant on the K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcite with a high MgO content. This indicates that MgO is probably responsible for the formation of basic sites on the surface of the sorbent, which are relatively easily regenerated at the investigated experimental conditions. The results also show that the sorbent with the highest MgO loading has the highest cyclic working capacity under dry adsorption conditions, whereas the hydrotalcite-based adsorbent with a lower MgO content has the highest cyclic working capacity for CO2 at wet conditions and is therefore the preferred sorbent for sorption-enhanced water-gas shift applications.",

     "abstract": "In palm oil production, sterilization is a vital process that can affect the quality of the extracted palm oil. The purpose of sterilization of oil palm fresh fruit bunch (OP-FFB) is to inactivate lipase activity and lipophilic microorganisms, soften the pulp of the fruits and facilitate the stripping process. The current practice of thermal sterilization in the palm oil industry, which utilizes conventional steam sterilization, is ineffective for lipase degradation and microbial inactivation in OP-FFB. The conventional steam sterilization technique operates at temperature 130\u202f\u00b0C\u2013160\u202f\u00b0C, elevated pressures of 0.15\u20130.4\u202fMPa, and sterilization time of 60\u201390\u202fmin. This sterilization method also requires huge amounts of water, which in turn demand higher energy usage and generates large quantities of palm oil mill effluent. Thus, waterless sterilization seems as a better option in yielding a high quality palm oil as well as protecting the environment. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) has been found to be a promising sterilization technology in the inactivation of various enzymes and lipophilic microorganisms. This technology inactivates enzymes and microorganisms physico-chemically relatively low temperature (\u226460\u202f\u00b0C) and moderate pressures (8\u201340\u202fMPa) without generating residual waste. Thus, the application of SC-CO2 bears the potential to sterilize OP-FFB, as a waterless sterilization technology. The present review was conducted to assess the possible use of SC-CO2 in OP-FFB sterilization and make comparisons to the existing OP-FFB sterilization method. This study also appraises the effectiveness of SC-CO2 in the inactivation of enzymes and microorganisms that lessen the quality the palm oil.",

     "abstract": "With regard to bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs a big goal in research is to improve their dissolution behavior in the gastrointestinal tract. One suitable way to enhance the bioavailability is the use of drug loaded carrier materials. However, the effect of carrier properties such as specific surface area, pore size and pore volume on the dissolution of drugs is not well known yet. To investigate this, carrier materials with defined properties were produced by Salt Assisted Spray Pyrolysis (SASP) and loaded with racemic ibuprofen by the Controlled Particle Deposition (CPD) process. Their loadings and dissolution rates were compared to those of MCM-41 and SBA-15. It was found that the ibuprofen loading on the SASP carrier materials is lower due to their smaller specific surface areas, whereas their dissolution rates were higher in comparison to CPD processed MCM-41 and SBA-15. Furthermore, it was observed that pore size and pore volume influence the loading capacity of carrier materials. Wider mesopores lead to multilayer formation where crystalline ibuprofen structures were detected by XRD analysis. N2-adsorption/desorption experiments at T \u202f=\u202f77\u202fK on the CPD processed carriers lead to the assumption that the small mesopores of MCM-41 or SBA-15 were occupied by ibuprofen due to the shift of the typical capillary condensation step at p/p0\u202f=\u202f0.3\u20130.4 (untreated material) towards lower relative pressures of the CPD processed carriers.",

Fully de-vulcanized BRR without impurities was produced from waste tire by regeneration. The properties of BRR were evaluated via systematic investigation of a number of experimental variables, and the effects of these variables on the molecular structure and the CO2 separation performance of the membrane were assessed. The BRR-derived membrane was fabricated by simple solution-coating on an Al2O3 support. The effect of the fabrication parameters, such as the solvent type, polymer concentration (8\u201312\u202fwt%), and curing temperature (room temperature to 100\u202f\u00b0C). The results indicate that the CO2/N2 separation performance of the BRR-derived membrane prepared with a low concentration (<10\u202fwt%) of coating dope in toluene solvent and cured at room temperature is competitive with that of membranes reported in previous studies due to the cis-isoprene structure. The CO2/N2 ideal selectivity of 11.6, coupled with a CO2 permeability of 86.9 Barrer, obtained with the 8RD-T25 membrane is comparable to that of a commercial rubber membrane.

     "abstract": "Dry reforming of methane (DRM) for synthesis gas production has a promising future in technological developments due to the utilization of CO2, the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas. However, this process is still far from industrialization because of catalyst deactivation by coking and sintering. In this study, a series of Ni(Mg)-Al hydrotalcite (HT) derived catalysts were prepared and compared to catalysts prepared by the conventional incipient wetness method. The as-prepared and calcined catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction, H2-chemisorption and scanning electron microscope. DRM experiments were carried out at a very high gas hourly space velocity of 240,000\u202fml/ (gcat\u202fh) to compare the activity and stability of the catalysts. The 20Ni-Mg-Al HT showed remarkably high and stable conversions in DRM at 750\u202f\u00b0C, while the 12Ni-Al HT catalyst presented the poorest activity, resulting from impure HT structure and consequently unstable Ni particles. The 20Ni-Mg-Al HT was further proved to be active and stable under various biogas compositions, even in the deficiency of CO2. This study demonstrates that pure HT-derived Ni catalysts are superior for DRM at different reaction conditions, and can be utilized for direct biogas upgrading.",

     "abstract": "A series of metal complexes containing a metal ion (Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Co) and two quaternary phosphonium salt units anchored on the ligands were designed and synthesized as efficient single-component bifunctional catalyst for the solvent-free coupling reaction of CO2 and epoxides without any co-catalysts. The effects of various reaction variables on the catalytic activity were investigated systematically and the optimized reaction conditions were screened as (130\u00a0\u00b0C, 1\u00a0MPa and 5\u00a0h). The order of the catalytic activity for these single-component bifunctional metal complexes was found to be Zn-PPBCl (96%)\u00a0>\u00a0Co-PPBCl (90%)\u00a0\u2248\u00a0Ni-PPBCl (90%)\u00a0>\u00a0Pb-PPBCl (86%)\u00a0>\u00a0Cu-PPBCl (15%). Notably, a high turnover frequency (TOF) value (1230\u00a0h\u22121) for bifunctional catalyst Zn-PPBCl was achieved via adjusting reaction variables. Moreover, this series of catalysts can also catalyze the coupling reaction at atmospheric pressure, and most of them showed high conversion of epoxide (propylene carbonate (PC) yield\u00a0>\u00a090%) within 7\u00a0h. The catalysts are also applicable to a variety of epoxides and good catalytic performances were achieved for producing the corresponding cyclic carbonates in most cases. Furthermore, the catalyst can be easily recycled and reused for at least five times without dramatic activity loss after simple filtration and drying. Finally, kinetic studies were carried out preliminarily for four metal (Zn, Co, Ni, Pb) catalysts and the formation activation energies (Ea) of cyclic carbonate were obtained. The apparent activation energy Ea catalyzed by Zn-PPBCl is only 37.6\u00a0kJ/mol, while the Ea (Pb-PPBCl) is 70.0\u00a0kJ/mol, Ea (Ni-PPBCl) is 65.6\u00a0kJ/mol, and Ea (Co-PPBCl) is 43.1\u00a0kJ/mol. The sequence of Ea agrees well with the catalytic activity. Based on the kinetic studies and experimental results, an inferred mechanism was deduced.",

Then, CLS (10, 20, and 30\u00a0wt%) was blended with DGEBA epoxy resin followed by amine-curing to produce the biocomposites. Spectral, thermal, thermomechanical, mechanical and morphological properties of the CLS-epoxy composites were studied by FTIR, DSC/TGA, DMTA, tensile/flexural testing and SEM, respectively. In comparison with the neat DGEBA network, by increasing the CLS% in the biocomposite, tensile strength decreased, flexural modulus was well-preserved, and the Young's and storage modulus were greatly improved. It was attributed to stiffening effect of the modified lignin particles as well as the formation of urethane bonds and intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding. The glass transition temperature for the biocomposites with 10 and 20\u00a0wt% of CLS showed negligible change. The incorporation of the carbonated lignin into epoxy resin could provide an eco-effective approach toward inexpensive high performance biocomposites.",

It turned out that this particular IL caused rapid and severe loss of initial biocatalyst activity, which fact can be seen as a threat in the membrane process design. Afterwards, the stability of pectin-containing SLMs (containing CA but lacking the IL having adverse impact) was addressed and their improved resistance against higher transmembrane pressures (up to 7.2\u202fbar) was found, representing an approx. 3-fold enhancement compared to their control. Thereafter, the performance of the membranes was tested under single and mixed gas conditions with carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Employing single gases, it was demonstrated that CA enzyme could notably increase CO2 permeability (from 55 to 93 Barrer), while that of N2 remained unchanged (1.6-1.7 Barrer).

Besides, stability under storage is a critical quality attribute to define the usefulness of scaffolds. In the particular case of bone scaffolds, the information on this regard is still very limited and strongly dependent on each particular composition and architecture. In order to gain an insight into this issue, scaffolds composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) as polymeric matrix, with and without pre-gelified starch (St) as release-controlling agent and dexamethasone (DXMT) as bioactive compound were designed and prepared by a modified compressed CO2 foaming technique (26\u202f\u00b0C, 60\u202fbar) and assessed regarding stability under storage.

Changes in the scaffolds point out the importance of stability assays and storage conditions.

The relative adsorption strengths of CO2, H2, CO, and CH4 species on Co/ZrO2 and Co/Al2O3 calculated by DFT showed qualitative agreement with experimental TPD. Importantly, DFT results uncovered an energetically more favorable H2 dissociative adsorption, faster H* surface migration, and more facile Co-O bond cleavage on Co/ZrO2 than on Co/Al2O3, thus rationalizing the experimentally observed lower temperature and higher degree of cobalt oxide reduction on the ZrO2 support.",

These IPC-n zeolites present an excellent set of siliceous model materials to analyze the effect of micropore structure on adsorption of carbon dioxide. Isosteric adsorption heats of carbon dioxide were determined from adsorption isotherms measured in the range 273\u202fK\u2013333\u202fK up to 101\u202fkPa. Obtained dependences of the adsorption heat of CO2 on the amount adsorbed are more sensitive to the adsorbent structure than single adsorption isotherms. It appears that due to domination of dispersion interactions of carbon dioxide with zeolites under study isosteric adsorption heat characterizes the structure features of investigated zeolites with a higher resolution then adsorption isotherms.",

However, the use of a HCl/NH4OH system was not yet elucidated. This study proposes to evaluate the feasibility of a pH-swing mineral carbonation based on HCl/NH4OH system at atmospheric pressure and moderate temperatures using mining waste from asbestos production from Goi\u00e1s State, Brazil (S-GO) for two conditions (i.e. stoichiometric conditions (T2E) and acid excess (T2)). Results indicated that the Fe3+ content in S-GO acted as a catalyst, due to FeCl3 hydrolysis in aqueous solutions. Thus, high Mg and Fe extraction efficiency (95\u202f\u00b1\u202f2%), were achieved in the leaching stage for both conditions. The S1 solid residue was mainly SiO2 with 90\u202f\u00b1\u202f1% purity content. In the purification stage 91.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.9% of Fet were removed, however, a loss of Mg of 13.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.3% was also detected. On the carbonation stage, high purity hydromagnesite was formed in T2E; this stage had a 85% efficiency, thus, 36.7% of CO2 was fixed. On T2, excess H2O and CO2 promoted dypingite formation and reduced hydromagnesite formation. After carbonation, the formation of crystals was observed in the NH4Cl aqueous solution at 25\u202f\u00b0C, indicating NH4Cl supersaturation. The results of mass balance indicate that 4 ton of mineral waste will be employed for each ton of captured CO2, as well as 2.6 ton of HCl, and 4.5 ton of NH4OH. However, 1.7\u202fton of SiO2, 0.55 ton of iron oxides, and 2.7 ton of hydromagnesite could be produced.",

In the presence of alcohol, the reaction proceeds through alcohol formate ester as an intermediate, allowing methanol synthesis at lower temperatures than conventional gas-phase synthesis. In the present work, alcohol-promoted CO2 hydrogenation to methanol was studied experimentally using a Cu/ZnO catalyst with 1-butanol and 2-butanol as solvents. As water is known to inhibit methanol synthesis on Cu/ZnO catalysts, the alcohol-promoted process was further developed by in-situ adsorption of water using a 3\u202f\u00c5 molecular sieve. The methanol productivity significantly improved as a result of the lowered concentration of water. The concentration of water was thus identified as a key factor affecting the overall methanol productivity. As the alcohol-promoted methanol synthesis process is characterized by two separate reaction steps, the use of separate catalysts optimized for each step offers an interesting approach for the development of this process. Such a dual-catalysis concept was tested using a copper chromite catalyst together with Cu/ZnO. Promising results were obtained, as methanol productivity increased with the addition of copper chromite. Catalyst characterization was carried out using XRD and SEM-EDS and potential effects of observed changes in catalyst structure during reaction are discussed.",

Various configurations of metallic honeycomb-type catalysts, which are plain, stacked, segment, and multi-stacked were constructed and tested under various reaction conditions; i.e. inlet temperature, feed flow rate and CO2 partial pressure. Effects of the developed configurations including stack and gap distance were examined. The random-flow channels of stacked type and the gap distance of segment type could improve the catalytic activity, resulting in high CO2 conversion. Under industrial-like high feed rate condition and pure feed gas component, a moderate hot spot over the multi-stacked catalyst was observed and reported for the first time. The moderate hot spot reboosted the conversion to a high level even at high feed flow rate condition of 3000\u202fmL/min (contact time of 235\u202fms). As a result, high CO2 conversion > 90%, high CH4 selectivity > 99.5%, and high stability with dropped conversion < 0.6%, could be maintained over 76\u202fh test at setting temperature of 300\u202f\u00b0C, flow rate of 3000\u202fmL/min and feed ratio of p C O 2 / p H 2 = 0.12 / 0.88 .

The volatile oil from Melaleuca cajuputi which has possible active allelopathy compound present is extracted and analyzed. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with central composite rotatable design (CCRD) is used to design the experiment for optimization of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction of volatile oil from Melaleuca cajuputi leaves for maximum oil yield. Three factors which included carbon dioxide (CO2) flow rate (4\u20137\u202fml/min), temperature (40\u201355 \u2103 ) and pressure (14\u201326\u202fMPa) were investigated. The regression model shows a good prediction with coefficient of determination, R2 of 0.9607. The optimum condition of SC-CO2 extraction is determined to be at CO2 flow rate of 5.88\u202fml/min, temperature of 43.10 \u2103 and pressure of 24.91\u202fMPa with the prediction yield of 1.24\u202fwt%. The optimum condition is validated with experimental runs which gives an average yield of 1.26\u202fwt% which indicates good agreement between the measured and predicted value. The chemical composition of the volatile oil at optimized condition is analyzed using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) and Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). Caryophyllene and humulene are the two major sesquiterpenes detected from the optimized condition. Thus, volatile oil extract from the foliage of Melaleuca cajuputi can be considered as potential source for bio-herbicides due to the presence of caryophyllene which has allelopathic effect.

The presence of H2O can enhance the decomposition of bidentate carbonates bond to the stronger basic surface-sites. The basic strength of the involved adsorption sites for bidentate formation appears to be highly heterogeneous.

Toward this aim, the wide-range conditions of key procedure variables such as reaction temperature, reaction time, and CO2 pressure on the rate of mineral carbonation were studied. In addition, preliminary analyses on red gypsum were carried out to determine its physical and chemical characteristics. The feasibility of direct carbonation of RG to form FeCO3 was assessed at different CO2 pressures of 1 to 70\u202fbar and different reaction temperatures of 25 to 200\u202f\u00b0C to discover the effects of the key functions on overall direct carbonation. In general, increasing CO2 pressure to 10\u202fbar was found to increase the overall FeCO3 purity and carbonation efficiency to 97% and 98%, respectively. Moreover, the reaction temperature affected the conversion rate at two different functions. First, FeCO3 purity and its carbonation efficiency increased to the maximum values when the reaction temperature increased to 150\u202f\u00b0C, and then they were slightly decreased to 91% and 92%, respectively, with increase of temperature to 200\u202f\u00b0C. The results also showed that the maximum product purity is achieved at optimum reaction time of 150\u202fmin.",

A PdCl2-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of COH bond of various lignin \u03b2-O-4 alcohol model compounds was developed for preparation of corresponding phenethoxybenzene in 78\u201398% isolated yield. Notably, the introduction of low-pressure CO2 (1\u202fMPa) remarkably improves the reaction efficiency and selectivity of phenethoxybenzene. Neither over-reduction of aromatic ring nor further debenzylation was detected. This is understandable that the in situ methylcarbonic acid generated from CO2 and methanol acts as an acidic catalyst and enhances the leaving ability of hydroxyl group of \u03b2-O-4 alcohols. Besides, the present PdCl2/CO2/MeOH catalyst system proved to be effective for reductive cleavage of CO bonds of \u03b2-O-4 ketones, producing ethylbenzenes accompanied with phenols in high yields. Furthermore, this protocol could also be extended to selective hydrodeoxygenation of the carbonyl group to methylene in aromatic ketones. As a sound reaction medium, such in situ CO2/MeOH acidic system could be inherently neutralized by depressurizing CO2, providing feature advantages for simple post-processing and none waste disposal.",

     "abstract": "Capture and conversion of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power generation systems is an important consideration. Tri-reforming of combustion exhausts (i.e. flue gas) with methane, which avoids the capture step, so as to produce synthesis gas for methanol production, has been proposed as a viable CO2 valorization alternative for conventional air-combustion systems. However, the presence of nitrogen that is not a reactive component results in increased reactor sizes and decreased efficacy of the tri-reforming based process. In this paper, we explore the use of tri-reforming with an oxy-fuel combustion process, where the nitrogen content of the combustion exhaust gas is considerably reduced, and therefore a carbon dioxide enriched feed is utilized for the tri-reforming coupled methanol production process. Also, to support the oxy-fuel combustion process, we propose utilization of water electrolysis as an oxygen source, while also utilizing the generated hydrogen in the downstream methanol production. The main contributions of this paper are therefore (i) the proposition of combining oxy-fuel combustion with the tri-reforming coupled methanol production process to mitigate the above drawback, and (ii) utilization of water electrolysis as a source of oxygen and an evaluation of the impact of the generated hydrogen on the CO2 valorization potential of the process. These two propositions have been implemented as process improvements on the conventional tri-reforming coupled methanol process. The resultant processes have been simulated using Aspen Plus V8.4, optimized and compared in this paper to justify their efficacy.",

     "abstract": "Microwave (MW) plasmas represent a promising solution for efficient CO2 dissociation. MW discharges are also very versatile and can be sustained at various pressure and gas flow regimes. To identify the most favorable conditions for the further scale-up of the CO2 decomposition reaction, a MW plasma reactor operating in pure CO2 in a wide pressure range (200\u202fmbar\u20131\u202fbar) is studied. Three different gas flow configurations are explored: a direct, reverse and a vortex regime. The CO2 conversion and energy efficiency drop almost linearly with increasing pressure, regardless of the gas flow regime. The results obtained in the direct flow configuration underline the importance of post-discharge cooling, as the exhaust of the MW plasma reactor in this regime expanded into the vacuum chamber without additional quenching. As a result, this system yields exhaust temperatures of up to 1000\u202fK, which explains the lowest conversion (\u223c3.5% at 200\u202fmbar and 2% at 1\u202fbar). A post-discharge cooling step is introduced for the reverse gas inlet regime and allows the highest conversion to be achieved (\u223c38% at 200\u202fmbar and 6.2% at 1\u202fbar, with energy efficiencies of 23% and 3.7%). Finally, a tangential gas inlet is utilized in the vortex configuration to generate a swirl flow pattern. This results in the generation of a stable discharge in a broader range of CO2 flows (15\u201330 SLM) and the highest energy efficiencies obtained in this study (\u223c25% at 300\u202fmbar and \u223c13% at 1\u202fbar, at conversions of 21% and 12%).

Experimentally, a diffusion cell has been used to perform diffusion tests for CO2 in tight formation cores, saturated with crude oil, under different pressure and temperature values. The dynamic pressure-decay curves of CO2 in the annular space of the diffusion cell were monitored and recorded during the measurements. Theoretically, the Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) with a modified \u03b1 function has been incorporated to develop a one-dimensional radial diffusion model for the CO2\u2013tight formation core systems. Also, the crude oil sample has been characterized as three pseudo-components for the accurate prediction of phase behavior of the CO2 and crude oil system. The CO2 diffusion coefficients, under different pressure and temperature values, were determined once the discrepancy between the measured and the calculated times, under the same pressure decrease of the diffusion process was minimized. According to the CO2 concentration profiles in the cores, the diffusion process is divided into two distinct parts, i.e., the early stage, characterized by the fast diffusion rate, and the later stage with the slow diffusion rate. While the pressure and the temperature increase, the CO2 diffusion coefficient initially increases quickly and then reaches a plateau. Lower viscosity of crude oil, higher temperature, and higher pressure facilitate the diffusion of CO2 into the crude oil, under tight formation conditions.",

MOFs crystallization in scCO2 is often carried out in the presence of other solvents, such as ionic or organic liquids, to increase reagents solubility in the reaction media. In this work, a totally new and cleaner way is followed, utilizing small amounts of an ancillary ligand to increase metal solubility, which result in a more efficient use of scCO2. The precipitation of 2D MOFs, based in the combination of different trifluoroacetates of transition metals (M(tfa)2, MII\u202f=\u202fCuII or ZnII), and a bidentate pyridine derivative (dpy), was studied. MOFs of the type [M(tfa)2(dpy)x]\u221d were precipitated using scCO2 as the solvent medium and the ligand tert-butylpyridine (t-bpy) as additive. The targeted 2D MOFs were precipitated after a short reaction time (ca. 3\u202fh) operating under relatively soft supercritical conditions (20\u202fMPa and 333\u202fK). This new synthetic approach is thought as a generic method that can be used to modify metal precursors in systems in which the reaction is too slow or incomplete in neat scCO2.

     "abstract": "The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 utilizes solar energy to mitigate CO2 emissions and is a promising technology for renewable fuel production. In this study, a novel twin reactor was developed to hydrogenate CO2 into hydrocarbons by using H2 directly produced from photocatalytic water splitting. The twin reactor was further modified to simultaneously perform the CO2 hydrogenation and water splitting reactions in the gas and liquid phases, respectively. Moreover, two photocatalysts, Pt/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2, were used to improve the photo-hydrogenation performance in the reactor. The results indicate that the H2 produced from water splitting effectively enhanced the CO2 hydrogenation in the gas phase, and we found that the highest CO2 reduction activity was achieved by using Pt/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 as the H2-generating and CO2 hydrogenation photocatalysts, respectively, which promoted H2 evolution and CO2 hydrogenation and resulted in enhanced CO2 photoreduction.",

The appearance and color of the dried samples did not show significant differences after the two processes.

     "abstract": "The conversion of CO2 into fuels and value-added chemicals is one the most promising and sustainable route for mitigating the atmospheric build up of CO2. However, the kinetic and thermodynamic limitations of the conversion process necessitate the need for the development of an efficient catalytic system capable of operating at favorable conditions to convert CO2 into value-added chemicals/fuel with industrial appeal. Various approaches have been implemented for the development of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems for CO2 conversion, but unfortunately, none of the current technologies for CO2 conversion meet the safety needs, mild reaction conditions, efficiency, selectivity and cost-effectiveness. Therefore nanotechnology has been the main focus of many researchers, as the technology can provide viable catalytic materials that can address all the challenges being faced with conventional catalytic systems used for CO2 conversion process. This review highlights some recent promising research results in the area of reductive and non-reductive conversion of CO2 into fuels and value-added chemicals over nanoparticles-based catalysts, and more importantly, the reaction mechanisms of CO2 conversion over these nanocatalysts.

In this work, ZnO/NiO porous hollow spheres with sheet-like subunits were obtained by calcination of the Ni-Zn bimetallic organic frameworks (MOFs). The prepared ZnO/NiO composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO2 recondition, and the highest CH3OH evolution rate was observed for sample ZN-30, which was about 3 times than that of pure ZnO. It is believed that the heterogeneous n-type ZnO and p-type NiO produced from the decomposition of heterothallic Zn-Ni MOFs are homogeneously mixed together, resulting in the formation of many p-n heterojunctions which could be benefit to the charge separation. Furthermore, such porous hollow structure could increase the specific surface area, CO2 uptake capacity as well as the light absorption property.

The goal of this work is to evaluate from a techno-economic point of view such a plant that uses captured CO2 and renewable H2 obtained in a carbon-free way and produces methanol (MeOH). The paper presents (i) the impact of using a higher conversion rate (30%) than in previously reported works, (ii) the use of a gas turbine and (iii) the addition of organic Rankine cycles (ORC) for reducing the energy consumption. The CCUS plant uses 142.6*106\u202fkg of CO2 annually, reduces the amount of CO2 emitted by 140*106\u202fkg/year and produces 100*106\u202fkg/year of MeOH. H2 is obtained on site, using a water-electrolyzing unit; this consumes 130\u202fMWe and generates the necessary H2 for the process. The proposed MeOH production plant is designed and simulated in ChemCAD. Total purchased equipment cost and operational costs are estimated using the process flow modeling. Key performance indicators (KPI) are calculated using the mass and energy balances obtained. The calculated capital costs are similar to previously reported results in the literature. A rigorous mass and energy integration of the plant resulted in an energetically fully self-sufficient MeOH plant, not taking into account the water-hydrolyzing unit. Electricity price is the main contributor for operational costs, either this should be halved, MeOH prices should increase two times or CO2 prices should increase to 0.255\u202f\u20ac/kg to make the process economically viable.",

The addition of Zn to a Co/ZrO2 catalyst, at a ratio of up to 2\u00a0wt.%, had a positive effect on the catalyst stability, whereas further addition beyond this threshold had the opposite effect.

Converting CO2 to chemicals such as syngas is a promising way to reduce CO2 emissions from stationary sources. In this work, we explore technologies for the thermochemical conversion of CO2 to syngas using both rigorous and reduced order reactor models. Specifically, we study the CO2 utilization potentials of primary reforming such as dry reforming (DR), steam methane reforming (SMR) and partial oxidation (POX), and combined reforming such as combined dry and steam methane reforming (CDSMR), auto-thermal reforming (ATR), combined partial oxidation and dry reforming (PODR) and tri-reforming (TR). Through detailed simulation and analysis, we show the importance of considering rigorous models for accurate prediction. We also develop algebraic surrogate models for reactor outlets as functions of reactor design and operating conditions. The replacement of the high-fidelity models with their simpler algebraic surrogates provides an efficient way for superstructure-based reactor synthesis. Using a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization (MINLP)-based reactor synthesis model, the reactors are further optimized for maximizing CO2 utilization and syngas selectivity. PODR has been found to have the highest potential for converting CO2 for the range of syngas ratios (H2/CO) between 1 and 1.7, achieving almost 100% CO2 conversion with a syngas selectivity ranging 80\u201393%. We further improve the conversion and syngas selectivity by distributing the feeds to multiple reformers. A combination of DR, CDSMR and TR achieves the best CO2 conversion for syngas ratios up to 2.4. For higher syngas ratios, a combination of SMR, TR and RWGS are found to be optimal.

Different synthesized oxygen carriers were evaluated in CO2-modified chemical looping reforming process at different conditions such as reaction temperature (500\u2013750\u00a0\u00b0C), CH4/CO2 ratio (0.5\u20133), alumina support base, ZrO2 position and manganese loading weight percentage (10\u201330). The presence of ZrO2 in the support structure significantly inhibited the deposition of coke on the surface of oxygen carrier. The characterization and process results revealed the noteworthy effect of Zr incorporation to the structure of alumina support. The redox results revealed that 20Mn/20Zr-Al oxygen carrier exhibited the highest activity even at low reduction temperatures. This oxygen carrier exposed the highest activity and stability with lowest coke deposition during 16 redox cycles at 650\u00a0\u00b0C. The methane and CO2 conversion, H2 yield and H2/CO molar ratio of about 99.0%, 96.6%, 65.2% and 2.55 were achieved at 650\u00a0\u00b0C using the optimized oxygen carrier. The synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N2 adsorption\u2013desorption (BET) techniques.",

     "abstract": "The production of ordinary portland cement (OPC) is a CO2 intensive process. Specifically, OPC clinkering reactions not only require substantial energy in the form of heat, but they also result in the release of CO2; i.e., from both the decarbonation of limestone and the combustion of fuel to provide heat. To create alternatives to this CO2 intensive process, this paper demonstrates a new route for clinkering-free cementation by the carbonation of fly ash; i.e., a by-product of coal combustion. It is shown that in moist environments and at sub-boiling temperatures, Ca-rich fly ashes react readily with gas-phase CO2 to produce robustly cemented solids. After seven days of exposure to vapor-phase CO2 at 75\u00a0\u00b0C, such formulations achieve a compressive strength of around 35\u00a0MPa and take-up 9% CO2 (i.e., by mass of fly ash solids). On the other hand, Ca-poor fly ashes due to their reduced alkalinity (i.e., low abundance of mobile Ca- or Mg-species), show limited potential for CO2 uptake and strength gain\u2014although this deficiency can be somewhat addressed by the provision of supplemental/extrinsic Ca agents. The roles of CO2 concentration and processing temperature are discussed, and linked to the progress of reactions and the development of microstructure. The outcomes create new pathways for achieving clinkering-free cementation while enabling the beneficial utilization (\u201cupcycling\u201d) of emitted CO2 and fly ash; i.e., two abundant, but underutilized industrial by-products.",

     "abstract": "Carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) has the potential to provide business cases as CO2 waste streams are turned into feedstock for the synthesis of marketable products. Although CCU could reduce fossil resource demand, its capability as a climate change mitigation option is under debate. In contrast to single-product CCU, this prospective study explores the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of novel systems that include more than one CO2 utilisation product. The combination of multi-product CCU with CO2 storage is also investigated. Two configurations have been designed, in which CO2 is captured in a refinery and converted into dimethyl ether (DME) and polyols, simultaneously (parallel configuration) or in two consecutive cycles (cascade configuration).Compared to a reference system without capture, results show that the largest direct CO2 emission reductions are achieved with CCS without utilisation (\u221270%) but at the expenses of higher total costs (+7%). Multi-product CCU systems show lower fossil depletion and costs than the reference without capture (\u221210% and \u22129%, respectively) because of feedstock replacement by the CO2 utilised. Combination of multi-product CCU with storage turns to be the best alternative for reduced climate change potential (\u221218% relative to the reference) while still been economically feasible. In addition to lower upstream emissions due to fossil feedstock replacement by utilising CO2, process direct emissions diminish owing to storage. No significant differences were found between the cascade and the parallel configurations. The extra effort to recycle CO2 in the cascade configurations is neither penalised nor rewarded.",

     "abstract": "This work presents a proposal for enhancing CO2 capture over lithium cuprate (Li2CuO2) by alkaline carbonates addition. Lithium cuprate was synthesized via solid-state reaction. Subsequently, portions of Li2CuO2 were mechanically mixed with 10\u00a0wt% of potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) or equal amounts of both carbonates (5\u20135\u00a0wt%). All samples were characterized by several techniques and then CO2 chemisorption process was evaluated on different dynamic and isothermal conditions. The presence of K and/or Na carbonates preserves the primary properties of pristine Li2CuO2, such as crystalline phase (DRX) and microstructure (SEM), also allowing to increase textural properties (N2 physisorption) and modifying CO2 desorption abilities (TPD), in comparison with pure material. In general, carbonates addition induces some changes during CO2 chemisorption, depending on the type of carbonate used. On the isothermal tests, it was observed that between 400 and 600\u00a0\u00b0C the sample containing both carbonates presented the best capture performance, capturing between 25.7 and 31.8\u00a0wt% of CO2 (63.9\u201379.1% of efficiency). On the other hand, at 700\u00a0\u00b0C, Na-Li2CuO2 sample presented the best capture ability, capturing 30.6\u00a0wt% of CO2 (76.1% of efficiency).

The above results showed that in the same thermal conditions, samples modified with alkaline carbonates improved the CO2 capture process. This enhancement was attributed to the formation of eutectic phases (observed in DSC analysis) between sodium and potassium carbonates added mechanically and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) formed as result of CO2 chemisorption process. Finally, it was observed that carbonate addition is a feasible way to increase CO2 capture in Li2CuO2 material by means of eutectic phase formation.",

The use of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) as the reaction medium in biocatalytic processes enhances the transport properties of substrates in the active site of enzymes, increasing the reaction\u2019s conversion. SC-CO2 has some operational advantages, such as tunability of their properties (density, viscosity, and solubility) and moderate critical conditions (Pc\u00a0=\u00a07.38\u00a0MPa and Tc\u00a0=\u00a031.05\u00a0\u00b0C).

Nevertheless, the use of co-solvents, reuse of catalyst, nature of lipases (free or immobilized) and pressurization/depressurization steps need to be evaluated in the biocatalyzed production of flavoring compounds in SC-CO2. Careful evaluation of these parameters is necessary to obtain an optimal ratio between enzyme/substrates/solvents.

A broad overview of carbon dioxide capture with metals in various forms including oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and zirconates is presented. Based on the findings from comparative assessments of these sorbents, CaO appears to be the best solid sorbent for CO2 capture at high temperatures, and its numerous advantages are discussed in this work. For this reason, a detailed review has been conducted for calcium oxide, which works as a sorbent at temperatures up to 700\u00a0\u00b0C through carbonation, and desorbs CO2 above 700\u00a0\u00b0C by calcination of CaCO3 at atmospheric pressure. A review of studies on kinetics modelling of CO2 capture with CaO-based sorbents is also included in this work. Decay in activity caused by sintering and attrition is identified as the greatest challenge with CaO-based sorbents. This work also focuses on the available techniques for enhancing performance and cyclic stability. Reactivation of the sorbents by hydration and reduction in decay rate by doping with inert supports and synthetic sorbents are reviewed. Additionally, the use of biomass resources (waste animal shells) as competitive sources of CaCO3 is discussed in this work.

The catalysts, prepared by different methods, were characterized combining morphological (BET, TEM), structural (XRD, in-operando XAS), electronic (XPS, in-operando XANES) analysis and H2-TPR experiments. The results showed that catalytic activity and CH4 selectivity depended on size and morphology of Ni particles, and that type and amount of deposited carbon strongly depended on Ni0 morphology. The kinetic measurements revealed that both H2 and CO2 reactants were activated on Ni sites, and that YSZ support was not directly involved in the reaction mechanism.The most efficient catalyst was that prepared by wet impregnation with Ni(EDTA)2\u2212 complex due to the high Ni0 dispersion.This catalyst showed low amount of carbon and remarkable stability over time on stream.

     "abstract": "Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration due to the combustion of fossil fuels has been linked to the presently observed global warming phenomenon. In order to mitigate excessive emissions, efforts are underway to capture CO2 from various emission sources and sequester it underground. In parallel, utilization of the captured CO2 to produce value added products and fuels has also been advocated. Among these products, methanol, which can be used as a fuel and fuel additive, is of particular interest. Methanol can be synthesized by hydrogenation of CO2 and could therefore lead to a carbon neutral cycle in the frame of a methanol economy, as proposed by the late professor George Olah. In this review, we reflect upon the recent advances in homogeneous reduction of CO2 to methanol using molecular H2. This research area has seen significant progress over the last five years and the recent studies for this challenging transformation are discussed herein. Catalyst activity, selectivity, reaction mechanism and other aspects are analyzed. We also comment on future prospects awaiting exploration to improve the catalytic systems for this reduction. We hope that this review will provide the reader with an overview of the current state of the art on homogeneous CO2 hydrogenation to methanol in a concise manner and provide potential directions in which further investigations can be undertaken in order to eventually make this process economically viable.",

     "abstract": "The photocatalytic pathway to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) to fuel, an artificial photosynthesis process, is a futuristic and ultimate way to combat the energy crisis and CO2 emission issues. The most widely used catalyst for photocatalytic reactions is titanium dioxide (TiO2) due to its availability, chemical stability, low cost and resistant to corrosion. Although TiO2 photocatalyst suffers due to its wide band gap (only can be activated under ultraviolet light irradiation) and high electron-hole recombination rate, it remained as a precursor for the development of visible light responsive materials for CO2 reduction through different modifications, such as doping of metal, nonmetal, semiconductors etc. There is a significant improvement in CO2 conversion using the visible light responsive TiO2 based catalysts. The product distribution due to the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 highly depends on the band gap and band edges of the catalyst. The understanding in the mechanistic pathway of CO2 reduction is very important to design the catalyst for the production of desired product. This present paper provides an overview of research and development of TiO2 based photo-catalysts for CO2 reduction and focuses on the improvement of the photocatalyst based on the band gap engineering, charge transfer and CO2 adsorption.

This paper provides an insight into the basic design and process analysis of a DME production plant by implementing Membrane Reactors to convert CO2 at acceptable values. The paper provides the process analysis of the overall plant architecture related to an innovative DME production process configuration, called Double Recycling Loop DME (DRL-DME), enables the utilization of a pure CO2 stream as sweeping gas in the permeation zone (PZ) and a double recycling loop to reintroduces the un-reacted syngas and the outlet stream from the PZ. The mathematical model of the entire plant is presented and implemented to study the effect of the process parameters on the performances. This paper brings a step forward by determining the possible configuration and the performance of a whole industrial plant, able to realize the DME synthesis from CO2-rich streams in membrane reactor with recirculation. The whole process includes the utilization of a pure CO2 external feed, the steam production and all the necessary separation units. By fixing the set point of the process control variables, the recirculation streams are calculated though a mathematical algorithm founded on previous literature results. Through the mathematical model it is possible to estimate the CO2 conversion and DME yield as well as the main features of the plant, by varying some important process parameters (e.g. feedstock composition, reactor pressure, H2/COx).",

The samples were comparatively evaluated as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide (CO2-ODEB). Results indicate that both Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 were active for CO2-ODEB and the Mn3O4 prepared by the precipitation method showed the highest conversion of ethylbenzene over 60%. Moreover, the activity of MnOx for CO2-ODEB was significantly affected by the synthesis method and parameters of the oxides. The correlation between the reaction and characterization results indicates that the CO2-ODEB over MnOx may follow the redox mechanism involving the lattice oxygen, and the amount of the mobile oxygen species and the surface area were revealed to be key factors in determining the activity of the MnOx catalysts for the titled reaction. Together with the characterization results of XRD, TG-DSC, and H2-TPR, the irreversible reduction of MnOx to MnO under the conditions of CO2-ODEB was the main reason for the deactivation of the catalyst while the coke deposition had a less important impact on the stability of the catalyst.",

Catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption, temperature-programed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Pd0 active sites were related to carbon monoxide formation via reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS), whereas the PdZn alloys catalyzed methanol synthesis. The role of copper in trimetallic catalysts was to inhibit the deposition of metallic palladium by forming a PdCu alloy that proved to be less active to CO formation. Moreover, the active sites of trimetallic catalysts were smaller and better dispersed than those of the corresponding bimetallic ones, probably due to a synergistic effect between the three metals. The catalyst with a molar composition of 37.5:12.5:50 Pd:Cu:Zn (mol.%) was selected as the most active for the methanol synthesis, as this sample showed the highest activity and selectivity to methanol. The role of copper was also shown to be crucial in trimetallic catalyst by comparing the best example with an equivalent bimetallic PdZn/SiC with a Pd:Zn molar ratio of 37.5:62.5.",

The PFA sample that displays the fastest kinetics to achieve 90% of the equilibrium uptake had the largest mesopore volume of 1.13\u202fcm3\u202fg\u22121. Given the PFA-derived MCM-41 uses a waste silicate solution for hydrothermal preparation and no prior preparation is needed, production costs are estimated to be considerable lower where silicate solutions need to be prepared by base treatment, even if ash is used, as for the RHA derived MCM-41 used here.",

Glow-discharge plasma-assisted CO2 hydrogenation was carried out under partial vacuum using a packed-bed catalytic reactor under two different configurations: In-Plasma Catalysis (IPC) and Post-Plasma Catalysis (PPC). CO2 hydrogenation into CO (CO2\u00a0+\u00a0H2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0CO\u00a0+\u00a0H2O) and CO2 methanation (CO2\u00a0+\u00a04\u00a0H2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0CH4\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0H2O) reactions were more efficient when the reaction was assisted by plasma using the IPC mode. In IPC mode, a novel phenomenon was observed: a considerable amount of methane was released from the catalyst after plasma extinction. This phenomenon was explained combining the operando IR plasma technique and the analysis of the carbon balance during the plasma-assisted CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Both configurations (IPC and PPC) were studied under different volumetric flow rates and the minimum lifetime of excited species generated within the plasma discharge for methane production was determined. The lifetime of the more active species which are responsible for methane production was lower than 67\u00a0ms. Under the operation conditions used in this work, methane production was only possible when CO2 hydrogenation was performed in IPC mode.CO2 hydrogenation was found to be more energy efficient when the reaction was carried out under plasma assistance compared to conventional heating.

A batch-type co-pyrolysis revealed two genuine CO2 co-feeding impacts on co-pyrolysis of swine manure and coal. First, CO2 can be an additional source for C and O through a plausible reaction between pyrolytic oil and CO2, which led to the enhanced generation of CO by the conversion of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) evolved from thermal deconstruction of pyrolytic substrate. Second, CO2 expedite the thermal cracking of VOCs, which also resulted in the more generation of H2 and CH4. Two genuine roles of CO2 in co-pyrolysis of swine manure and coal occurred independently.

The yield of formate was remarkably enhanced (7\u00a0mmol/g cat-hr) by combining plasmonic gold nanoparticles with TiO2. It was found that in the photocatalytic reaction, glycerol not only serves as an efficient hole sinks but also the oxidation of glycerol may produce additional formic acid further enhancing the overall productivity. When illuminated with 365\u00a0nm photon with energy sufficient to excite valence band to conduction band electronic transitions in the TiO2, the productivity of TiO2 alone dramatically improves in comparison to solar light. However, no effect of gold nanoparticles was observed under 365\u00a0nm irradiation.

The CaL process usually employs limestone as CaO precursor for its very low cost, non-toxicity, abundance and wide geographical distribution. However, the multicycle activity of limestone derived CaO under relevant CaL conditions for TCES in CSP plants can be severely limited by pore plugging. In this work, the alternative use of calcium-rich steel and blast furnace slags after treatment with acetic acid is investigated. A main observation is that the calcination temperature to regenerate the CaO is significantly reduced as compared to limestone. Furthermore, the multicycle activity of some of the slags tested at relevant CaL conditions for TCES remains high and stable if the treated samples are subjected to filtration. This process serves to remove silica grains, which helps decrease the porosity of the CaO resulting from calcination in the mesoporous range thus mitigating pore plugging.",

A clear understanding of underlying mechanisms, through which the metal-promoters influence initial sorbent properties and/or rejuvenate deactivated sorbents, can help rationalize the design.

Next, by DFT calculations we explore the effect of metal-promoters on the chemical reactivity and resisting sintering of sorbents. Results showed that Al and Mg could slightly weaken the adsorption energy, but Zr and Na could enhance obviously the adsorption energy, especially for Zr, the adsorption energy as strong as 2.38\u00a0eV. The more adsorption energy is more favorable for the enhancement of carbonate extent.

A previously developed recycling concept where the catalyst complex was immobilized in 2-ethylhexan-1-ol was transferred from lab-scale into a continuously operated miniplant in order to evaluate stability, selectivity and recyclability of the catalyst. The results confirmed a high robustness of the reaction system and showed carbon monoxide as only byproduct in small ppm concentrations. The gas dosage had a major impact on the catalyst activity. While an oversaturation with carbon dioxide lead to only 14% yield of DMF, a stoichiometric dosage of carbon dioxide to amine lead up to a yield of 43% DMF at an even shorter residence time of 3.5\u00a0h. The main reason for this effect could be located on the equilibrium formation of ammonium salts with carbonates and/or carbamates, which reduced the basicity of the reaction system. The whole setup showed a stable activity of over 95\u00a0h without catalyst refreshment. Investigations towards the product isolation by distillation showed that all substrate and solvent streams are recyclable and no product decomposition occurred.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the CH4CO2 gas exchange method at macro and microscopic level, and the CO2-based hydraulic fracturing. The process of CH4 replacement by CO2 is comprehensively discussed considering two possible CBM storage mechanisms; 1) by adsorption and; 2) at hydrate state. The CH4CO2 gas exchange by sorption/diffusion process has been proven to be kinetically and thermodynamically viable as CO2 can easily penetrate through ultra-micro-pores region and adsorb into the coal pores due to its smaller kinetic diameter, linear shape and higher affinity. The gas exchange occurs in the hydrate phase at special reservoir conditions has also been shown to be feasible kinetically, chemically and thermodynamically, given the fact that the reverse reaction (i.e. CO2 replaced by CH4) is different and rather inefficient. Therefore CBM extraction using CO2 replacement is confirmed to be an effective extraction technique. The use of CO2, particularly in its super-critical state, as a fracturing fluid has a number of advantages. Owing to its gas-like viscosity and compressibility, super-critical CO2 (S-CO2) easily infiltrates through tiny defects in rock formations, inducing thinner and more three-dimensionally extended cracks, while maintaining a low break-down pressure. On the other hand, the liquid-like density of S-CO2 exerts more pressure on the rock, so that it can easily exceed the minimum principal stress and rock tensile strength, resulting in easy crack initiation. However, such CO2 utilization methods, particularly those based on super-critical CO2 are still novel to the CBM extraction industry and should therefore be subjected to careful investigation prior to implementation.",

Besides with a small amount of HCOOH (<5%), H2 and CO are the main CO2 reduction products with a tunable ratio of from 1.16:1 to 6.38:1 by changing the applied potentials. The gaseous products with various ratio of H2 to CO can be potentially used as syngas to produce more valuable products in industry. This work demonstrates a simple, facile and effective way to improve the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance of Cu-based composites.",

Metal-organic framework (MOF) MOFs has recently been developed with the primary objective of CO2 capture from flue gases with minimum energy penalties. MIL-101(Cr) holds the supreme importance amongst such types of MOFs owing to its extraordinary thermal and hydro stability. In this study, a novel composite composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) incorporated in a MIL-101(Cr) framework has been synthesized using a molecular-level mixing process in order to enhance the thermal properties of the base framework as well as augment the CO2 adsorption capacity and separation. The synthesized and activated MWCNT/MIL-101(Cr) composites have been characterized for degree of crystallinity, microstructure, thermal stability, and CO2 and N2 equilibrium adsorption capacity. Actual dynamic behavior of adsorption breakthrough tests have been conducted under ambient conditions (297\u00a0K and 101.325\u00a0kPa) to address the real adsorptive behavior and to quantify the level of the CO2 adsorption capacity and breakpoint enhancements.Results demonstrate that a substantial improvement in the CO2 adsorption capacity and breakpoint over pristine MIL-101(Cr) is achievable with the 2\u00a0wt% MWCNT/MIL-101(Cr) composite with measured optimal enhancements of about 35.94% and 32.11%, respectively.",

The experimental isotherms were used in temperature-dependent equilibrium modelling to simulate equilibrium CO2 working capacities in pressure-swing adsorption (PSA), temperature-swing adsorption (TSA) and temperature-vacuum swing adsorption (TVSA). Experimental adsorption capacities of 0.80\u00a0mmolCO2/gsorbent and 0.89\u00a0mmolCO2/gsorbent were obtained from 400\u00a0ppmv CO2 in dry cold conditions and at 25\u00a0\u00b0C in humid conditions, respectively. The highest experimental capacity gained from 400\u00a0ppmv CO2 was 1.06\u00a0mmolCO2/gsorbent in humid cold conditions. In terms of the working capacity, PSA was found not to be a viable process option. Humidity promoted TSA working capacity up to by 0.36\u00a0mmolCO2/gsorbent (78%). TSA could produce larger than 0.5\u00a0mmolCO2/gsorbent working capacity levels even with very low regeneration temperatures (50\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C) when adsorbing either in dry cold conditions or humid warm conditions. Such EWC levels with dry TVSA could only be achieved using 90\u00a0\u00b0C regeneration temperature with adsorption in either cold conditions or from compressed air.

     "abstract": "CO2 utilization is increasingly considered a greenhouse gas abatement strategy alternatively to CO2 storage. Existing indicators that assess the performance of CO2 utilization options often provide an incomplete perspective and are unsuitable to compare different utilization options with different functionality (e.g. plastics and fuels). This study introduces a new performance indicator for CO2 utilization options: Specific Primary Energy Consumption per unit of Fossil feedstock Replaced (SPECFER). This indicator, expressed in MJ/MJ, provides a proxy for the energy efficiency of which CO2 conversion options can replace fossil feedstock required in conventional processes. Three CO2 utilization case studies (CO2 based methanol, polyols and dimethyl ether) are used to show the application and effectiveness of the SPECFER indicator. Among the case studies, only CO2 conversion into polyol appears particularly efficient (SPECFER of 0.05\u00a0MJ/MJ), while the other options are not (SPECFER of >\u00a01\u00a0MJ/MJ). The paper shows that the SPECFER indicator adds key insights compared to conventional indicators to the effectiveness of CO2 utilization options and is a promising indicator complementary to CO2 emissions reduction or life cycle greenhouse gas reduction potential. The SPECFER thus improves the understanding of the performance of CO2 utilization and enables the possibility to distinctly compare different CO2 converting utilization technologies.",

The development of CO2-based industrial symbiosis partnerships can contribute significantly towards achieving the goals of GHG emissions reduction on a European level by 2030, while at the same time it leads to an increased added value through the development of new production lines and carbon neutral products. The presented article focuses on identifying potential partnerships between companies that produce CO2 and companies that may reuse CO2 as input for their industrial process. A novel methodological framework is presented based on developing generic matrices for CO2 sources and receivers and matching the industrial units based on geographical and technical criteria. Moreover, the paper provides the technical requirements of 17 CO2 utilization technologies with relatively high technology readiness level, including the CO2-to-product ratio, the required purity, pressure, temperature and the presence of a catalyst, as well as potential synergies and additional requirements. The methodology has been applied to the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland region in West Sweden and the most promising CCU symbioses have been identified. These include mineral carbonation (annual uptake: 59,600 tCO2), greenhouses (26,000 tCO2), algae production, methanol production (85,500 tCO2), power to gas (66,500 tCO2), pH control, lignin production, polymers synthesis and concrete curing (96,000 tCO2).

The desired product dictates the syngas characteristics, which are also affected by the employed syngas synthesis technology. In this work, we study the process of producing syngas under desired specifications while consuming CO2 in the synthesis. We propose a superstructure that includes seven reforming technologies for the syngas production, as well as a variety of auxiliary units to control the final composition of the syngas. Each potential solution is assessed, in terms of the economic and environmental performance, by the Total Annualized Cost (TAC) and the Global Warming Potential (GWP) indicator. As the problem statement involves discrete decision, we use disjunctions to model the system. The resulting MINLP multi-objective problem is solved by the epsilon constraint method. Results show that at low syngas H2/CO ratios and pressures, dry methane reforming (DMR) is capable of net consuming CO2. Partial Oxidation (POX) is the technology that exhibits the minimum TAC, although shows the maximum value for the GWP. Synergistic combination of two processes allows reducing the cost and CO2-equivalent emissions through the pairing of DMR and bi-reforming (BR) and BR with steam methane reforming (SMR). Furthermore, increasing the CO2 content in the syngas at a fixed (H2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0CO2)/(CO\u00a0+\u00a0CO2) ratio proves that TAC and GWP decrease as the CO2/CO ratio increases.",

Furthermore, the solubility data were satisfactorily correlated by Chrastil model and m-ER&HV model (modified Esmaeilzadeh\u2013Roshanfekr equation of state combined with Huron\u2013Vidal mixing rule), and the thermodynamic consistency of the solubility data was confirmed by the thermodynamic consistency test.",

To begin, in this study, CO2 capture kinetics of these adsorbents are investigated by different adsorption kinetic models including pseudo-first order model, pseudo-second order model, Avrami model, and the fractal-like exponential kinetic model. Subsequently, the Eyring and Arrhenius equations are used to determine the activation parameters related to the CO2 adsorption on these adsorbents. Furthermore, a mechanism is proposed to describe the negative activation energy assessed for CO2 adsorption on the studied adsorbents.

This would result in better solutions with near-zero-carbon-emissions level. From an energetic and economic point of view, methanol synthesis from CO2 is a competitive alternate to methanol production from biomass. Our work considers the CO2 balance for the technologies proposed, taking into account all CO2 flows from/to the environment. Flue gas CO2 streams released from electric power stations, steel industry, petroleum industry, and cement industry are good candidates for the developed technologies. Three new processes are developed and modelled for converting CO2 streams into liquid methanol. The total cost of equipment and utility for all process scenarios are evaluated and compared. The energy targets as well as the CO2 emissions (balance) are determined. Heat integration is performed on the best selected process technology. The case study employed for the present work is a power station plant burning natural gas for electricity production with a capacity of 112\u00a0MW, releasing 328\u00a0t/h flue gases to the atmosphere, of which CO2 gas accounts for 14%; hydrogen required for CO2 conversion comes from the chlor-alkali industry. The optimum process technology reached in this contribution results in methanol production of 0.625\u00a0t-per-tonne of CO2 waste gas supply, leading to an annual production of 222,507\u00a0tons methanol with a profit of 56.55\u00a0M$/y.

Low temperature desorption (90\u00a0\u00b0C) suggested that the hybrid solvent containing CA/Zn-Im: HFS has 1.57 times higher desorption kinetics compared to the neat hybrid solvent.

In this particular work, we report the synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (NS-g-C3N4) using a very facile synthesis technique and its utility in adsorption of CO2 along with the ionic functionalization of NS-g-C3N4 with ionic liquid 1-Butyl-3-Methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide ([BMIM][TFSI]) and its CO2 adsorption properties.

NS-g-C3N4 shows a CO2 sorption capacity of 19.78\u00a0mmol/g at 15\u00a0bar pressure and 25\u00a0\u00b0C which is almost two times more than that of bulk g-C3N4 (8.54\u00a0mmol/g) under identical conditions. Besides, when NS-g-C3N4 is functionalized with ionic liquid, the interface between ionic liquid and NS-g-C3N4 significantly increases the sorption capacity to 42.93\u00a0mmol/g under nearly ideal conditions. The temperature is varied from 25 to 100\u00a0\u00b0C and pressure is varied from 2 to 25\u00a0bar. The high nitrogen content in graphitic carbon nitride nanostructures (56.6\u00a0at.%) acts as the active sites for binding the CO2 molecules while the non-covalent ionic liquid functionalization allows CO2 to interact with NS-g-C3N4/[BMIM][TFSI] by physicochemical adsorption mechanism and thereby enhances the CO2 capture.",

This paper presents a new technique, named rapid pressure increase method (RPI) to measure MMP and investigate the phase behavior of the analyzed fluids. The main principle of the measurement are determination of the relation between pressure increase and reduced volume of binary system and registration of the moment at which derivative of the function is the lowest. This point corresponds to ratio change of pressure increase to reduced volume and is considered as MMP. Determined values fit well with previous work and literature data.

Therefore, as a means to rapidly screen suitable ILs as potential solvents for CO2 absorption, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) based models to establish structure\u2013property relationships between molecular structures of cations and anions and their CO2 solubilities. Over 10,000 IL-CO2 solubility data of 185 ILs measured at different operating temperatures and pressures were extracted from the literature. Using semi-empirically derived geometrical and charge-based molecular descriptors, good agreement with the available experimental measurements was obtained for both single decision tree (mean absolute error of 0.10) and ensemble random forest (mean absolute error of 0.04) approaches. The results were found to be more accurate than those obtained with the quantum chemistry based COSMOtherm predictions.",

     "abstract": "Uniform microparticles of vanillin were precipitated by the Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solution (RESS) process and this reduced the commercial particle size by a factor of one hundred. A design of experiments full factorial at two levels was performed. The effects that pressure, temperature, contact time and nozzle diameter had on the particle size and yield of the RESS precipitation were evaluated. Pressure and temperature were the factors that had the most marked effects on particle size and yield. The use of higher pressure and temperature is recommended to obtain the smallest particle size and the highest yield. However, at lower pressure the temperature is a crucial factor in that the use of a lower temperature led to considerably smaller particles and good yields whereas a higher temperature gave the highest particle size and the lowest yield. A higher contact time and smaller nozzle diameter led to slight improvements in the vanillin particle size and yield according to the results of the design. The crystallinity of the RESS-processed vanillin was unaltered when compared to the unprocessed material.",

     "abstract": "Oxidizing/gasifying agents play an essential role in the economy of underground coal gasification (UCG). The selection of feed gases to UCG depends on the prevailing conditions and inherent properties of a coal seam. Steam based UCG operation would lead to transportation and operational difficulty for efficient gasification. Alternatively, CO2 gas is a potential gasifying medium for coal gasification and this option would ensure the reutilization of waste CO2 gas in a UCG operation. Thus, in the present study, borehole coal combustion and gasification experiments are carried out to simulate CO2 enhanced UCG system using a low ash coal originating from the Northeast region of India. UCG experiments are simulated in a laboratory scale using CO2/O2 gases and the results are compared with pure oxygen and oxygen enriched air based UCG operation. The composition and calorific value of syngas are analysed for various gasifying agents. The CO2/O2 borehole experimental studies show that a CO enriched product gas (\u223c40 vol.%) can be generated under dried coal seam conditions. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) studies show that the rate of pyrolysis is higher under a CO2 atmosphere as compared to N2 atmosphere. Further, the TGA results show that the generated CO2 pyrolysis products led to substantial char gasification even at low temperatures. The reactivity of tar with CO2 enhanced the calorific value of the product gas due to dry reforming reactions. Also, the presence of suitable inorganic species in the coal progressed the CO2 gasification through ash catalysis.",

     "abstract": "Ni is usually used as the catalyst for the CO2 methanation to generate the substitute natural gas (SNG) due to the low cost. However, it often possesses relatively worse low-temperature catalytic activity than the noble metal counterparts. In order to solve this problem, a series of Ca doped Ni based ordered mesoporous materials had been facilely fabricated via the one-pot evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) strategy and directly used as the catalysts for CO2 methanation. These materials had been systematically characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, TEM, SAED, EDS, XPS, H2-TPR, and CO2-TPD measurements. It was discovered that the large specific surface areas (210.7\u2013240.7\u00a0m2/g), big pore volumes (0.37\u20130.46\u00a0cm3/g), and narrow pore size distributions (8.3\u20139.5\u00a0nm) of these materials had been successfully retained after 700\u00a0\u00b0C calcination. In these materials, Ni species were homogenously dispersed among the Al2O3 matrix via the one-pot fabrication strategy and the strong interaction between Ni and mesoporous framework had been formed. Thus, the seriously thermal sintering of the metallic Ni nanoparticles could be successfully inhibited. Hence, they displayed no deactivation after 50\u00a0h stability test toward CO2 methanation. More importantly, the doping of the Ca greatly enhanced the surface basicity, which could favor the chemisorption and activation of CO2. As a result, the apparent activation energies of CO2 could be remarkably decreased from 75.2 to 53.6\u00a0kJ/mol and the low-temperature catalytic activity had been significantly promoted. Therefore, these Ca doped Ni based ordered mesoporous materials promised potential catalysts for CO2 methanation.",

The enhanced catalytic performance and stability were explained in terms of the variations of surface basic sites with different aggregation phenomena of active nickel crystallites and resistances for a coke formation. The most efficient Sm promoter having a high electronegativity and basic property on the Ni/M-Al2O3 was found to largely suppress a coke deposition and less aggregation of active nickel crystallites by forming the strongly interacted nickel nanoparticles with an enhanced basic sites on the Sm-modified Al2O3. In addition, a larger amount of basic sites on the Ni/Sm-Al2O3 were responsible for a less coke deposition and best catalytic performances in terms of the conversions of CH4 and CO2. These positive effects of Sm promoter were also attributed to a relatively easy activation of CO2 and the formation of the strongly interacted smaller nickel crystallites on the newly formed basic perovskite-like SmAlO3 structures or segregated Sm2O3 species.",

For the improving syngas production the reforming reactor is substituted by a tri-reforming reactor, also, reaction pressure (1\u201310\u00a0bar) and temperature (500\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013800\u00a0\u00b0C) are investigated.

     "abstract": "This paper aims to propose an evaluation method for measuring the supercritical CO2 thickening result for particle transporting. By analyzing the particle transporting trajectory in supercritical CO2, the cotangent of particle landing angle (ratio of particle horizontal velocity to vertical velocity) was proposed as a new criterion of thickening result. Previous studies of supercritical CO2 thickening were evaluated and drawn in three dimensions using this new criterion. Moreover, the effects of CO2 density and viscosity on particle vertical and horizontal velocities and the cotangent of particle landing angle were analyzed. The cotangent of particle landing angle is more sensitive to supercritical CO2 density than viscosity. Therefore, supercritical CO2 density should be considered for the evaluation of supercritical CO2 thickening for particle transporting. The particle settling velocity was found to determine the particle transporting distance and also the transporting capability of supercritical CO2. According to this conclusion, the apparatus for experimental evaluation of supercritical CO2 thickening will be miniaturized significantly by the simplification from two-dimensional velocities measurement into one direction, particle settling velocity in vertical direction. Additionally, the supercritical CO2 viscosity was found to have an optimum value, exceeding which the effect of viscosity on particle transporting levels off.",

The breakthrough curves measured in a fixed-bed have been fitted by this model under various operational conditions. This model uses the intraparticle diffusion coefficient as the fitting parameter and other transfer parameters can be calculated through current correlation equations. A satisfactory agreement between the modeling results and the experimental data has been obtained with just one fitting parameter. The effect of temperature, pressure, and concentration on the intraparticle diffusion coefficient has been investigated and the molecular pore diffusion within the solid adsorbent is found to be the rate-controlling step for the overall adsorption process.

Selectivity, regenerability, purity, isosteric heat and working capacity values, for each structure, have been calculated from simulations, providing a rather complete evaluation of adsorbents\u2019 performance. Additionally, for all the structures the temperature dependence of the heat capacity has been modeled to estimate the thermal regeneration energy. Calculated heat capacities range from 0.78\u20130.86\u00a0kJ/kg\u00a0K at 313\u00a0K to 0.98\u20131.15\u00a0kJ/kg\u00a0K at 473\u00a0K, values considerably lower than those corresponding to aqueous amine solutions. Comparison of TSA results with previous Vacuum and Pressure Swing Adsorption (VSA and PSA) ones shows that there is no structure that works well for all three processes. Instead, each process reaches optimum conditions for certain range of Al content. Results indicate that high Al content faujasites, 64-to-96-FAU, are the most effective for TSA with working capacities above 1.7\u00a0mol/kg, doubling PSA/VSA values. Intermediate Al content 48-,64-FAU perform better at VSA conditions and low Al content 12-,24-FAU structures are more suitable for PSA processes. At moderate operative conditions (i.e., regeneration temperature of 413\u00a0K), TSA shows the highest purities (above 99% for one-stage process), followed by VSA and PSA. Finally, TSA is more effective in cleaning faujasites with 48 or more Al, compared to PSA/VSA, leading to a higher regenerability (energetic cost index range between 2.3 and 2.4\u00a0GJ/tCO2).",

The analysis of the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) revealed that the conformation of the MHC in both MWDS and MWS changed significantly relative to its initial structure. Moreover, the results of the solvent-accessible surface area demonstrated that the MHC structure changes from a compact arrangement to a looser arrangement in both MWDS and MWS. Finally, the results from investigations into the secondary structures showed that the \u03b1-helix content of the MHC decreased, whereas the \u03b2-turn and random coil content increased. Greater overall structural variations of the MHC were observed in MWDS than those observed in MWS.

The differences in the performances of these monovalent exchanged samples were thus attributed to the reported enhancement of the CO2 adsorption capacity and framework basicity of the zeolites containing these cations. In terms of divalent cations, Mg2+ sample presented both the lower Ni particle size and the better performances, while no relevant differences were observed in terms of Ni species reducibility and textural properties among all the divalent samples. Thus, Mg2+ induces not only an enhancement of the CO2 activation, but also of the Ni dispersion.

The effects of various process parameters (biogas flow rate, discharge power, CO2/CH4 molar ratio and Ni loading) and their interactions on the hybrid plasma-catalytic biogas reforming were evaluated using response surface methodology through a four-factor, five-level central composition design. Quadratic regression models were developed to gain a better understanding of the relationships between these process parameters (independent variables) and the biogas conversion, syngas yield and energy efficiency (responses) of the plasma reforming process. The results indicated that biogas flow rate was the most significant factor affecting the conversion of CO2 and CH4 and syngas yield, while the CO2/CH4 molar ratio was the leading process parameter determining the energy efficiency of the process. In addition, there was a trade-off between the biogas conversion and energy efficiency of the process at different specific energy inputs (SEI).

     "abstract": "Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a widely studied approach applied in abating the atmospheric CO2 levels and relieving energy shortage. As the first step in the process of CO2 reduction, CO2 adsorption plays an important role in photocatalytic activity. In the present work, the CO2 adsorption ability of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was evaluated by adsorption energy derived from first-principle calculation. To provide a more realistic result, a variety of parameters, including various adsorption sites, separation distances and rotation angles were examined to determine the most stable adsorption system. The results showed that CO2 molecule preferred to adsorb at the two-coordinated nitrogen atom, which contributed to both valance band and conduction band edge. The most negative adsorption energy obtained was \u22120.4181\u00a0eV, which is indicative of physisorption. The electronic properties of the adsorbed system were investigated, including band gap, density of states, work function, the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. The effects of molecular number of the adsorbate and layer number of the adsorbent on the adsorption behavior were also examined. This work provides initial and significant reference for the in-depth study of the process of photocatalytic CO2 reduction on g-C3N4.",

The removal efficiency of CO2 and toluene was maximised in the vertical absorption column by identifying an optimum liquid to gas (L/G) ratio of 15. The photobioreactor supported steady-state nitrogen and phosphorus removals of 91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% and 95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04% using 15% diluted centrate at 14 and 7 d of hydraulic retention time (HRT), respectively.

The study focused on the effect of different operating parameters, such as temperature, pressure, H2/CO2 molar ratio and adsorbent volume capacity, on the reactor performance with the aim to define the optimum operating window. The analysis was also performed for the conventional process as benchmark. The continuous removal of H2O shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium and drives the reactions of CO2 to completion under the entire investigated parameter range. In temperatures and pressures of interest for practical application (220\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013270\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u201370\u00a0bar), the methanol yield is up to 130% higher in the sorption-enhanced process compared to direct hydrogenation. The only negative aspect was the decrease of CH3OH selectivity in favor of CO production. Despite this, the benefits of water sorption are indisputable and overcome the slight decrease in selectivity. The simulation of the complete process, including gas recycle, showed that with in-situ water removal 15% higher methanol productivity can be attained, with very high once-through CO2 conversion and CH3OH yield and very low gas recycle. This has important implications on the economics of the process, as it decreases the size of the reactor and the auxiliary equipment and practically eliminates the need for downstream methanol-water separation via distillation, leading to substantial process intensification and reduction of capital and operating costs.",

     "abstract": "Converting CO2-rich waste streams such as raw biogas, landfill gas and power plant flue gas into synthetic fuels and chemicals will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, providing revenue at the same time. One option is to convert CO2 into CH4 by hydrogenation via Sabatier reaction. This synthetic methane will be renewable if the H2 required for the reaction is generated via water electrolysis using solar and wind energy or hydroelectricity. However, to realize the potential of this approach, a number of technological challenges related to the Sabatier reactor design have to be resolved, including thermal management. The high exothermicity of the Sabatier reaction can lead to reactor overheating. High temperatures are unfavorable to the exothermic and reversible methanation process, resulting in low CO2 conversions. A simulation-based study of a Sabatier reactor was performed in order to optimize the removal of heat, while maximizing CO2 conversion and CH4 production. The heat-exchanger type packed bed reactor with internal cooling by a molten salt was simulated using a transient, pseudo-homogeneous mathematical model. Reactor performance was evaluated in terms of CO2 conversion and CH4 yield. The simulation results show that feed temperature, feed flow rate, and molten salt flow rate are the crucial parameters affecting the reactor performance. For the optimized operating conditions, the model predicts CO2 conversions and CH4 yields above 90% at high reactor throughputs, with space velocities up to 10,000\u00a0h\u22121. A preliminary techno-economic evaluation is provided: opportunities and challenges are outlined.",

The high energy penalty of absorption technology can be addressed using low heat of absorption solvent. However, the challenge of using low heat of absorption solvent is to develop a practical approach to intensify absorption rate. In recent years, high frequency ultrasonic system emerges as a potential technology for mass transfer process. In this study, the potential of using high frequency ultrasonic system have been investigated using the slow kinetic solvent: (potassium carbonate) without utilizing any chemical promoter. The ultrasonic-assisted absorption system with 20\u00a0wt% potassium carbonate (without promoter) has provides 1.75 times higher volumetric mass transfer coefficient than the Piperazine (PZ) promoted potassium carbonate using stirring method. The absorption rate has been increased up to 32 times as compared to the case without ultrasonic irradiation. Besides, the required absorption time to achieve 0.9 loading (CO2 mole/K2CO3 mole) has been significantly reduced to approximate 400\u00a0s. Furthermore, an ultrasonic-assisted absorption model has been developed by including the atomization, ultrasonic streaming, and ultrasonic chemical effect in order to investigate the mechanism involved in high frequency ultrasonic-assisted absorption. Based on the model validation study, the ultrasonic chemical effect is essential to be considered in order to match the simulated and the experimental results. The results of current study prove that, high frequency ultrasonic system possesses high potential to be utilized to enhance the absorption using promoter-free potassium carbonate.",

The main target of this study was to obtain stable and active catalysts by the support modification with the addition of promoters. The catalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal method, whereas the characterization was carried out using XRD, BET, TPR, TPD, TGA/DTA and TEM. In case of Co-Ni/Mg-SBA-15 and Co-Ni/Sc-SBA-15, the better dispersion of Co and Ni species was obtained over the support due to the textural promoting effect of Mg and Sc, enhancing strong metal support interaction (MSI). Subsequently, the bimetals were successfully aligned and anchored into the hexagonal mesoporous channels of the supports. The dry reforming of methane was done in continuous fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. Upon doping of Mg and Sc modifiers to the support, the CH4 conversion increased compared to the bare SBA-15 supported catalysts by 28% and 26%, while the CO2 conversion improved by 12% and 15%, respectively at 700\u00a0\u00b0C. TEM as well as TGA/DTA of the used catalysts revealed that the coke resistance was significantly improved as a result of the support modification, leading to the formation of amorphous carbon. Thus, the prolonged activity of Mg and Sc-modified support catalysts for 50\u00a0h revealed excellent stability of Co-Ni/SC-SBA-15 catalyst. Consequently, Sc emerged as a novel textural promoter, which remarkably improved the catalytic activity and exhibited outstanding stability.",

     "abstract": "CO2 utilisation is gaining interest as a potential element towards a sustainable economy. CO2 can be used as feedstock in the synthesis of fuels, chemicals and polymers. This study presents a prospective assessment of carbon capture from a hydrogen unit at a refinery, where the CO2 is either stored, or partly stored and partly utilised for polyols production. A methodology integrating technical, economic and environmental models with uncertainty analysis is used to assess the performance of carbon capture and storage or utilisation at the refinery.Results show that only 10% of the CO2 captured from an industrial hydrogen unit can be utilised in a commercial-scale polyol plant. This option has limited potential for large scale CO2 mitigation from industrial sources. However, CO2 capture from a hydrogen unit and its utilisation for the synthesis of polyols provides an interesting alternative from an economic perspective. The costs of CO2-based polyol are estimated at 1200\u00a0\u20ac/t polyol, 16% lower than those of conventional polyol. Furthermore, the costs of storing the remaining CO2 are offset by the benefits of cheaper polyol production. Therefore, the combination of CO2 capture and partial utilisation provides an improved business case over capture and storage alone. The environmental assessment shows that the climate change potential of this CO2 utilisation system is 23% lower compared to a reference case in which no CO2 is captured at the refinery. Five other environmental impact categories included in this study present slightly better performance for the utilisation case than for the reference case.",

The product of the reaction is P-ylide-CO2 adducts. Because of a more negative character of the Vmin values, these adducts are potentially better organocatalysts than the P-ylides for CO2 transformation. Also, natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses show that hyperconjugation and negative hyperconjugation effects are responsible for the magnitude of the electron density of the bond between nucleophilic carbon and phosphorous atom.

The results show that, the pressure increases in a linear method after hypothermic liquid carbon dioxide is injected into the tubing. In the jet nozzles at bottom hole, the pressure drops abruptly by 6.55\u00a0MPa. The increasing trend of temperature slows down gradually as well depth increases, and it dominates the changing trend of both density and viscosity of carbon dioxide. The density, viscosity and conductivity all decreases with increasing depth, while the changing trend of conductivity is dominated by the increasing pressure. As the well depth increases, the capacity firstly increases because of larger temperature increase and then it gradually begins to decrease because of larger influence of pressure increase. The pressure transmission is directly related to density profile and viscosity profile, and the heat transfer is mainly dominated by the temperature difference between carbon dioxide in the tubing and formation rock.

The CO2 and N2 adsorption data demonstrated that the hydrogel copolymers were selective for CO2. Furthermore, the granules were capable of capturing CO2 in the presence of water. The results of absorption of CO2 on water-swollen granules demonstrated that CO2-uptake capacity increases with increasing water content up to 1.8\u00a0mmol\u00a0g\u22121.",

In a similar manner, the interaction between these functional groups and water has also been determined and later transferred to aqueous MEA. At the end, a reliable and consistent set of molecular parameters has been obtained for MEA. The CO2 absorption process is described in terms of the aggregation of the reactants driven by the presence of strong intermolecular interactions. Descriptions of the density, vapor pressure and surface tension in these systems provide excellent agreement with the available experimental information. Also, a very good estimation of the CO2 loading in MEA is found in the range of operating conditions. Predictions on the mixing enthalpies and the enthalpy of absorption are also given.

Copper nanowires (NWs) are used as the precursor for the deposition of small Cu nanoparticles (NPs) onto commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs), preliminarily activated with HNO3 to create oxygen functional groups on their external surface (o-CNTs). The Cu NWs, in contact with a suspension of o-CNTs in an ethanol-water mixture, transfer Cu fragments onto the o-CNTs. The result is a good dispersion of ultrafine Cu NPs (with an average size of less than 3\u00a0nm) preferentially deposited on the external part of the CNTs and evidencing a crystal phase structure of fcc (face-centered cubic) metal Cu(0). The catalytic active phase (Cu NPs/CNTs) was assembled on a gas diffusion layer and tested in the electro-reduction of CO2, in presence of KHCO3 aqueous electrolyte and under a continuous flow of pure CO2. For comparison, an electrocatalyst synthesized by conventional impregnation route (leading to higher size Cu NPs on o-CNTs and CuO monoclinic phase structure) was also tested. Results showed that the electrode with Cu NPs prepared by NW route was the best in terms of average current and carbon productivity, giving threefold higher formic acid and methanol production with respect to the conventionally prepared Cu/CNT sample. Moreover, C2-C3 products (ethanol, acetic acid, isopropanol, acetone) were obtained, showing the possibility of CC bond formation, probably due to the interfacial catalytic sites between the small Cu NPs and CNTs.",

To better comprehend the effects of ECBM using liquid CO2, a combination of low-pressure nitrogen adsorption-desorption (LP-N2-Ad), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the varying characteristics in coal before and after infiltration by liquid CO2. The specific surface area and volume were 5.08% and 9.82% higher on average in the treated specimens than in the untreated ones. The average pore diameter and permeability of the treated samples were higher than those of the untreated samples. The features of the pore structure after liquid CO2 immersion were found to be characterized by new pore generation and the transformation of original pores into larger ones. D1 and D2 can be used to quantitatively represent the adsorbed pore surface roughness and volumetric complexity. They were both found to be higher after liquid CO2 treatment, which indicated the treated coal samples have more rough and complex pore structure than that of the raw specimens. D4 can be used to describe characteristics of seepage pores. A positive relationship was obtained between D4 and seepage capability. The SEM images indicated a higher number of microfractures and fewer minerals filled in the coal pores with the treated specimens, representing an improvement of seepage capability with the coal samples through liquid CO2 infiltration.

In this regard, the present work aims to investigate the CO2 methanation performance of cobalt-based catalysts supported on different metal oxides (MxOy: CeO2, ZrO2, Gd2O3, ZnO) at low temperatures (200\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C) and under atmospheric pressure. Various characterization methods, such as N2 adsorption-desorption at \u2212196\u00a0\u00b0C, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), were employed to correlate the structural and surface properties of the materials with their catalytic activity. The results revealed a significant impact of support nature on the CO2 hydrogenation performance. The following order, in terms of CH4 yield (YCH4), was recorded at 300\u00a0\u00b0C: Co/CeO2 (\u223c96%)\u00a0>\u00a0Co/ZnO (\u223c54%)\u00a0>\u00a0Co/G2O3 (\u223c53%)\u00a0\u223c\u00a0Co/ZrO2 (\u223c53%). On the basis of the characterization results, the superiority of Co/CeO2 catalyst can be mainly ascribed to its enhanced reducibility linked to Co-Ceria interactions. Moreover, Co/CeO2 demonstrated a stable conversion/selectivity performance under subsequent reaction cycles, in contrast to Co/ZnO, which progressively activated under reaction conditions. The latter is related with the modifications induced in elemental chemical states and surface composition of Co/ZnO upon pretreatment in reaction conditions, in contrast to Co/CeO2 sample where a stable surface performance was observed.",

The CO2 co-feeding impact on co-pyrolysis with various mass ratios of PMS and SCG was also evaluated to explore any catalytic effects arising from CO2 and Fe/Ca species in PMS. The decrease in pyrolytic oil substances was apparent due to the synergistic effects of CO2 and Fe/Ca species. Moreover, the generation of CO was catalytically enhanced in the presence of Fe/Ca species in PMS. Co-pyrolysis in CO2 not only converted the impregnated Fe ions into magnetite (Fe3O4), but also created porous biochar. One biochar fabricated at the optimal mass ratio (PMS:SCG\u00a0=\u00a07:3) exhibited the highest adsorption capability toward As(V) due to adequate balancing between the amount of Fe/Ca solid minerals and biochar porosity. As a result, co-pyrolysis using CO2 as reaction medium can be a feasible option for the generation of CO along with production of biochar as a byproduct which can be used in environmental application.",

This bifunctional catalyst consists of a porous ZrO2-PAIHF polymer crosslinked with APS that was further immobilized with nucleophilic bromide ions. Porous ZrO2-PAIHF provides a physical barrier to prevent cooperative Lewis acid/base species and nucleophilic parts movement, aggregation, and detachment from the support into the product stream. The performance of Br/APS/Zr-PAIHFs as heterogeneous catalyst was investigated for the reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with styrene oxide (SO) which leads to the formation of styrene carbonate (SC). The influence of various reaction parameters including reaction temperature, reaction time, solvents, and CO2 pressure were systematically investigated in detail. Our results indicated that the synergistic cooperative effect of nucleophilic bromide ion (Br\u2212) and Lewis acid/base species on PAIHF supports leads to a maximum SC selectivity of 99.1%.

Many studies have been conducted to date on the effect of CO2 phase on coal mass permeability. However, the effect of coal rank on these permeability changes with CO2 phase has not yet been studied. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate how the influence of CO2 phase condition on coal flow performance varies with rank. A series of tri\u2013axial permeability tests was conducted using Australian brown coal samples for both CO2 and N2 under various confinements and injections at 35\u00a0\u00b0C. The results were then compared with those for high-rank coal reported in the literature. According to the test results, greater coal macro-pore-structure rearrangement occurs with super-critical CO2 adsorption, resulting in lower permeability in coal, regardless of rank. However, this CO2 phase influence is much greater for high-rank coal. Although coal permeability reduces with depth for any rank of coal, this depth effect reduces with increasing rank. Furthermore, although N2 has the ability to recover CO2 adsorption-induced swelled areas in coal regardless of rank, that capability is much greater for high-rank coal.",

     "abstract": "The conversion of CO2 and H2 to valuable products, such as methanol (CH3OH), methane (CH4), hydrocarbon fuels (CH2) and carbon monoxide (CO) has attracted a great deal of research. In general, the focus of most work done in this field has been the development of better catalysts for the production of fuels and chemicals. In this article we look at CO2 hydrogenation from a process synthesis point of view, adopting a systems approach to evaluate and compare the performance of selected routes for the conversion of CO2 and H2 to valuable products namely methanol, methane, hydrocarbon fuels and carbon monoxide. The various routes are assessed in terms of defined mass and energy balance targets. More particularly, the paper introduces the concept of chemical potential efficiency target, which can be expressed as the ability to conserve the chemical potential of the feed materials when they are converted into products. It is shown that the chemical potential efficiency can be translated into work or useful energy conservation. It is also shown that the maximum chemical potential efficiency targets of the considered products are relatively high. They vary from 86% to 100%, with the production of CH4 having the lowest and that of CH3OH having the highest efficiency target, even though the hydrogen efficiency is low due to water production. The analysis also takes into account the combustion efficiency of the products of CO2 hydrogenation relative to that of hydrogen, and it is found that production of CO has the highest chemical potential target of 96%, while that of CH4 remains the lowest at 83%. Another notable finding is that most two-process combinations can be targeted for 100% chemical potential efficiency. However, such processes come with a penalty that heat has to be rejected or supplied externally. Nevertheless, the COCH4 combined process offers 100% chemical potential efficiency, with no external heat or work transfer required. This indicates that CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH4 is possibly the most efficient way for storing renewable energy (solar, wind and hydroelectric) via water electrolysis, to produce H2 as an intermediate product.",

The adsorption results show the importance of a preliminary thermal treatment of the sorbents under inert gas, in order to maximize the CO2 capture capacities via the thermal cleaning of CeO2 surfaces (atmospheric and synthetic pollutants) liberating the access to CO2 adsorption sites. CO2 capture capacities depend on the specific surface area of the cerium oxide powders, reaching a maximum of 50\u00a0mg of CO2 adsorbed per gram of CeO2 displaying a specific surface area of 200\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121.

Specifically, DFT was used to investigate methanol synthesis from CO/CO2 hydrogenation on these surfaces at P\u00a0=\u00a080\u00a0atm, T\u00a0=\u00a0553\u00a0K and (CO+ CO2)/H2\u00a0=\u00a020/80. The results show that methanol can be synthesized from CO or CO2 hydrogenation and is dependent on the catalyst\u2019s preparation as well as the active site type. Further, CO is the main carbon source when the surface is predominantly covered by Cu+ species. However, CO2 is the primary carbon source when metallic Cu covers the surface. Under the reaction conditions investigated, H2 and CO easily reduce Cu2O to metallic Cu, and the Cu+ species are stabilized by the presence of H2O, CO2, carrier (such as MgO) or alkali metals. For this reason, the scale of methanol produced from CO or CO2 hydrogenation depends on the ratio of Cu+/Cu0.",

CO2 facilitated the thermal cracking of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that evolved from the thermal degradation of PCBs. As a result, CO2 mitigated the evolution of various harmful pollutants such as phenol and benzene derivatives, PAHs and brominated pollutants, which resulted in the increased generation of syngas (H2 and CO).

The synthesized FlueBNPC showed enhanced electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the fuel cell cathode. Boron and nitrogen in the carbon network, which were simultaneously doped from flue gas in a single step, interplayed as active sites for the electrochemical reaction. The FlueBNPC showed higher electrocatalytic activity than previous heteroatom-doped carbon materials and comparable activity to that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst with a dominant four-electron transfer pathway. This enhancement originates from the newly formed BN bonding combined with oxygen atoms in the carbon network. The synergetic effect of nitrogen attachment to the boron centre of the OBC bonds was investigated by DFT calculations. Our results indicate that flue gas itself can be used as an effective precursor for the one-step process not only to convert CO2 into useful carbon materials, but also to insert boron and nitrogen atoms into the carbon lattices, and we demonstrate a potential utilization of the flue gas as a carbon source for electrochemial applications.",

The business case for Power-to-Gas for bio-methane has been evaluated using three future cumulative electricity prices curves. Results show that a positive business case exists only for price curves based on large amounts of intermittent electricity installed. The room for investment for the electrolyser will mainly and highly depend on future commodity prices and price curves, and will benefit significantly from a decrease in the cost price of the electrolyser. The projected room for investment available for a PEM electrolyser is lower than for a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOE), because of its lower efficiency and resulting higher operating costs. In the case of large capacity of intermittent electricity, the projected room for investment of an SOE electrolyser is 650\u00a0\u20ac/kW and for a PEM electrolyser 350\u00a0\u20ac/kW, which corresponds to the projections of future electrolyser costs.",

PGO joins, thus, the restricted number of modified polymeric C-species (fullerenes and carbon nanotubes-CNT) having photochemical activity. Using acetylacetone as test molecule and bare PGO, two isomeric carboxylic acids were formed with ca. 3.5% yield under white (solar) light irradiation that was enhanced to over 10% after deposition of CuO on PGO. Under the reaction conditions, CuO alone gave only minor traces of the carboxylated products. Therefore, the two components together produce a synergistic effect that reinforces the photocatalytic activity of each of them. Interestingly, both PGO and CuO@PGO do not have the correct potential for the generation of the radical anion CO2\u2212, therefore the reaction mechanism of formation of the carboxylated products cannot imply the formation of CC bond via radical coupling. Most likely, the one-hole oxidation of acetylacetone to the relevant radical is the starter of the carboxylation process that implies the transfer of two electrons to CO2. The possible implicacy of HCO2H in the carboxylation has been demonstrated by the presence of such compound in the photocatalytic reaction mixture under CO2 and by the direct carboxylation of acac with formic acid under dinitrogen in the same operative conditions as with CO2.",

In this study, laboratory experiments on CO2\u2013water\u2013rock interactions were conducted to investigate the geochemical reactions using rock samples from typical sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Based on the experimental results, 3D reactive transport simulation models for sandstone and carbonate reservoirs were established to simulate the geochemical reactions and their effects on heat mining rate during geothermal exploitation using CO2. The potential of CO2 storage in the heat mining process in different geothermal reservoirs was also assessed. The experimental results show that, for the sandstone tested, the presence of CO2 can lead to the dissolution of ankerite and clay minerals and the precipitation of plagioclase, which can result in the increase of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in formation water. For the carbonate tested, CO2 can induce the dissolution of dolomite and the precipitation of ankerite and calcite. The numerical simulation results indicate that the influence of the geochemical reactions on flow behavior and heat mining rate is dependent on the reservoir type and mineral compositions. For the sandstone reservoir, the reduction of the porosity caused by minerals precipitation has a negative effect on heat mining rate, while for the carbonate reservoir, the dissolution of dolomite and clay minerals can overshadow the precipitation effect of calcite and silicate minerals and increase the heat mining rate.",

The TGA test evidenced that any physical aspects describing the thermal degradation such as onset and end temperature were not influenced by CO2. A scale-up experimental work was also conducted with a batch-type tubular reactor to figure out any chemical influences induced by CO2 in pyrolysis of food waste. CO2 in pyrolysis of food waste imparted the genuine capability for shifting carbon distribution from pyrolytic oil to syngas. CO2 led to carbon distribution shift from pyrolytic oil to syngas (i.e., enhanced generation of H2 and CO).

Among all the examined catalytic reaction pathways, we found that the most favorable pathway is composed of two stages: the formation of the formamide (FA) species and the reduction of the FA species to the target product methylamine (MA). Over the zinc complexes, the FA species formation begins with the reaction of N-methylaniline with CO2, followed by the reduction of CO2 with PhSiH3 to the formoxysilane (FOS) species. The formation of the FOS species prefers to proceed through the \u201cSN2@Si-Acceptor\u201d SiH bond activation mechanism and is predicted to be the rate-determining step (RDS) for the overall reaction. The ammonium carbamate (AC) zwitterion generated in the reaction of N-methylaniline with CO2 is the nucleophilic species to promote SiH bond activation, and the zinc complex is demonstrated to be effective in facilitating the CN bond formation in the reaction of N-methylaniline with CO2 and stabilizing the nucleophilic AC zwitterion. The calculations reveal that the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand plays two main roles in the reaction. (i) Preventing the coordination of the FA species to the zinc center and avoiding a decrease in the nucleophilicity of the carbonyl oxygen atom in the FA species, and (ii) lowering the Lewis acidity of the zinc center, which makes the activity of the SiH bond less decreased.",

     "abstract": "The study of CO2 separation from typical flue gas streams containing other gases like N2, CO, H2 and CH4 by Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) process using binderless 5A zeolite beads as adsorbent is the main objective of this work. Firstly, single component adsorption equilibrium isotherms of CO2, CH4, N2, CO and H2 have been determined by gravimetric technique in a magnetic suspension microbalance (Rubotherm\u00ae) at three different temperatures (305, 333, and 363\u00a0K), up to 5\u00a0bar. A comparison between the obtained adsorption equilibrium data and reported values in the literature for other 5A zeolite adsorbents was performed. Dynamic studies were also done through single and binary breakthrough curves of N2, CO, H2 and CH4 at 4\u00a0bar and 308\u00a0K. A PSA experiment was performed, at pilot scale, with the aim of validating the developed PSA model for CO2 capture with the binderless 5A zeolite adsorbent. The adsorption equilibrium isotherms were fitted with the Toth model and breakthrough curves and the PSA experiment were simulated taking into account the adsorption dynamic behaviour of a fixed bed. CO2 recovery values between 81 and 98% and energy consumption between 5.7 and 3.8\u00a0MJ/kgCO2, for purification of a stream containing 10% of CO2 by different PTSA cycles were attained. For all designed PTSA cycles the product purity was higher than 95% in CO2; and the productivity was always above 13\u00a0kg/mbed3/h. The best results are obtained with a high pressure of 3.5\u00a0bar, a low pressure of 0.3\u00a0bar and a heating temperature of 403\u00a0K. For these operating conditions the lowest value of energy consumption is obtained (3.8\u00a0MJ/kgCO2) with a high CO2 recovery (94.8%) and high CO2 purity (95.2%). The achieved productivity was of 16\u00a0kg/mbed3/h.",

Cement production contributes about 7% of the total worldwide CO2 emissions, and thus finding a practical way to reduce the greenhouse gas emission is essential. Construction and demolition (C&D) waste rich in calcium hydroxide and calcium silica hydrate is considered to be a potential calcium source for CO2 sequestration, forming thermodynamically stable carbonate minerals. In the past decade, a major research effort was to study the influencing factors affecting the effectiveness of active carbonation of C&D waste. In this paper, active carbonation techniques adopted for crushed concrete aggregate and waste cement derived from the C&D waste, and the resulting properties of the CO2 cured concrete aggregate and cement waste are discussed. In addition, special features of concrete block products as a potential medium for CO2 sequestration are also highlighted. Lastly, based on the environmental benefit and cost analysis of CO2 sequestration through C&D waste and concrete block are also presented. We concluded that the mineral carbonation of C&D waste is technically feasible, economical and environmentally friendly approach of a future carbon sequestration strategy.",

     "abstract": "Of the various potential CO2 sinks available deep underground, saline aquifers are dominant due to their huge storage capacity and broad worldwide distribution. CO2 injected into deep saline aquifers is stored in them through various trapping mechanisms, of which residual or capillary trapping can achieve greater CO2 storage capacity. However, the formation of residual water that mainly occurs during the CO2 drainage process has a negative influence on this CO2 residual trapping process, because it acts as a barrier to the CO2 flow through the aquifer\u2019s pore channels. This study is a comprehensive review to identify the influence of residual water saturation on CO2 sequestration and factors affecting it.There are number of influencing factors on the residual water formation process, which are mainly related to the physical properties of the reservoir and the injected CO2 properties and process. These factors include, CO2-brine interfacial tension (IFT)-related factors, contact angles in brine-CO2-rock systems, aquifer rock mass heterogeneity and mineral composition, the permeability and porosity of the aquifer, two-phase equilibrium, and CO2 injection rate and duration. However, it should be noted that these factors mutually contribute to residual water formation in saline aquifers during CO2 sequestration and therefore, the overall influence decides the efficiency of the final residual water formation in the aquifer. This work is a state-of-the-art report on the effectiveness and evaluation of reservoirs for CO2 storage purposes.",

     "abstract": "Shale gas is the second largest source of unconventional fuel in the world. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) fracturing not only allows effectively breaking paper to the shale gas recovery but also could the replace of methane with carbon dioxide. In this method CO2 adsorption in the shale affects the physical and chemical structure of the shale formations. Therefore, the change of reservoir physical properties will affect the efficiency of fracturing. The main objective of this study is to investigate supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) effects on the physical structure (porosity, deformation, and mechanical properties) and chemical structure (mineral components) of the shale. Four types of experiments were conducted: (1) pore characteristics by low-pressure nitrogen adsorption. (2) the mineral composition of the shale test. (3) The CO2-induced (adsorption-induced and pressure-induced) deformation of the shale teste. (4) The triaxial compressive strength and tensile strength of samples test. The results show that shale pore properties could be change by the SC-CO2. The specific surface of the shale decreased and the porosity and average pore size increased. The mineral content of the shale minerals (except quartz) decreased after SC-CO2 treatment. The samples exhibited swelling strains caused by SC-CO2. At low pressures, shale deformation was mainly caused by adsorption, while deformation at higher pressures was mainly caused by pressure. After the SC-CO2 treatment, the tensile strength, triaxial compressive strength, and elastic modulus of the shale decreased. The strength decreased as the treatment time increased. The changes in the strength of shale could be explained by two mechanisms: the dissolution effect of SC-CO2 and the adsorption/pressure-induced strain. It indicate that supercritical carbon dioxide can change the characteristics of shale reservoir, and it could reduce the fracturing pressure of supercritical carbon dioxide fracturing and enhance the efficiency of fracturing.",

Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the major challenges facing the world today. In Portugal the growing volume of MSW has become a central problem for municipalities, due to lack of space and the high costs to solve it. Gasification is starting to be considered as a possible alternative when dealing with municipal wastes. However, first is necessary to overcome some concerns related to the process, such as tar mitigation and carbon dioxide emissions.The presented study focuses on a second law analysis conducted on Portuguese MSW gasification using carbon dioxide and air mixtures. To do so, a previously developed numerical model, validated using data from a semi-industrial plant, was used to assess carbon dioxide injection. First, influence of operational conditions on syngas exergy values was studied. Exergy values increased close to 6% when equivalent rate was increased from 0.15 to 0.25, steadily dropping with further increase. On the other hand, exergy values appear to steadily increase with carbon dioxide addition (14% when increased from 0 to 1) and reactor temperature (40% when increased from 700 to 900\u00a0\u00b0C).Then, the influence of temperature and CO2/MSW ratio on exergy efficiency, tar efficiency and carbon dioxide conversion was investigated. Results showed that both parameters have a positive effect on exergy efficiency. Conversely, CO2/MSW ratio and gasification temperature lead to decreases in both tar exergy efficiency and in carbon dioxide.",

The co-precipitated 12NGDC-cp catalyst with 12\u00a0wt% NiO was found to be superior in terms of high CO2 and CH4 conversions compared to catalysts prepared through citrate gel or impregnation methods Even H2 and CO yields are high on this catalyst, while it shows excellent durability with stable activity even after 100\u00a0h on-stream. Thermogravimetric analysis of spent catalyst showed presence of coke, with transmission electron microscopic studies pointing to the presence of Ni crystallites at the mouth of the carbon whiskers. These Ni crystallites appear to be still active for DRM reaction. Among the spent catalysts, the carbon formation was high on catalysts that have bigger Ni crystallites, with the catalysts prepared through impregnation and citrate gel methods having higher coke. Investigations also reveal that the conversion of active (amorphous) carbon into stable (graphitic) carbon depends on the Ni crystallite size, temperature and duration of the reaction. These studies demonstrate that Gd doped ceria is a good support for Ni, to obtain high DRM activity and very good on-stream stability provided the catalysts are prepared through an appropriate method.",

For this reason, the influence of the alkalinity and physicochemical properties on CO2 absorption behavior of four azole-based PILs, namely [DBNH][Pyr], [DBNH][Im], [DBUH][Pyr], and [DBUH][Im] was discussed in this work. The alkalinity of PILs was determined by potentiometric titration, and free space of PILs was evaluated by thermal expansion coefficient and refractive index. Solubility parameter of PILs was obtained from the activation energy for viscous flow. The results show that PILs with [Pyr]\u2212 exhibits stronger alkalinity and larger free space, which can help to improve CO2 capture capacity. Whereas PILs with larger cation size [DBUH]+ exerts higher viscosity, resulting in slower absorption rate of CO2. Furthermore, the CO2 absorption capacity is inversely proportional to the solubility parameter of PILs. The absorption mechanism proved by FT-IR and 13C NMR spectra indicates that [Pyr]\u2212 or [Im]\u2212 can react with CO2 to form carbamate. Accordingly, considering the CO2 capture capacity and absorption rate, [DBNH][Pyr] may be a good candidate for efficient CO2 capture and activation with low enthalpy of absorption of \u221238.2\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121.",

     "abstract": "Coal structure undergoes a series of complex changes during pyrolysis which can affect the gasification reactivity. Lignite was used as raw sample to prepare char samples by pyrolyzing under CO2 and N2 atmospheres in the temperature range 500\u2013800\u00a0\u00b0C in a fixed-bed reactor. The structural features of chars were characterized by N2 adsorption analyzer and FT\u2013Raman spectroscopy. The reactivity of chars was investigated in a thermogravimetric analyzer under CO2 atmosphere. The results indicated that the yields of char from pyrolysis under CO2 at 500 and 600\u00a0\u00b0C were higher than that under N2; however, the specific surface area of the chars prepared under CO2 was nearly the same as that prepared under N2. At 700 and 800\u00a0\u00b0C, the char yields prepared under CO2 were less than that under N2; however, the specific surface areas exhibited reverse trend, which could be attributed to the occurrence of char-CO2 reaction. Notably, the reactivity of chars formed at lower temperatures was higher than that formed at higher temperatures under both CO2 and N2 atmospheres. The reactivity of chars obtained under CO2 atmosphere was lower than that under N2 atmosphere at same pyrolysis temperature, which was mainly due to the higher aromaticity and the low ratio of small to large rings.",

     "abstract": "Coalbed Methane (CBM) contains 97% of CH4 and very less amount of sulphur. Methane is a very high calorific value (\u224555.7\u00a0MJ/kg) gas as well as a greenhouse gas, which gets adsorbed on coal beds during coalification. Hence, capture of this CBM gas prior to coal mining not only prevents fire hazard but also the emission of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. As the CBM gas is enriched in chemical energy, it is a promising source for power generation. In the present study, Raniganj (Jharkhand, India) Coal Field (RCF) properties are considered for CBM case study. A detailed energy analysis for the CBM and ECBM integrated carbon neutral power generating systems such as steam turbine, combined cycle (CC) and fuel cell systems is presented and the net thermal efficiency of each power plant with carbon capture and storage is estimated. High pressure coal seam is considered for combined cycle and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cycle operation. Integration of power plant with CBM is studied for various coal seam operating pressures in the range of 3\u20131\u00a0MPa and a high net thermal efficiency of 68.3% is found at 30\u00a0bar with carbon capture and storage (CCS) for CBM integrated fuel cell cycle. In case of CBM integrated combined cycle and steam turbine system, a net thermal efficiency of 45% and 41% is estimated, respectively. An increase in 0.5% net thermal efficiency is calculated for ECBM case as compared to CBM under identical operating conditions of coal seam.",

Adsorption and desorption equilibria were measured gravimetrically for temperatures between 308\u00a0K and 338\u00a0K and pressures up to 5\u00a0bar.The Langmuir adsorption model was used to fit sorption data and the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) was used to calculate selectivity from single-component isotherms suggesting that separation can be enhanced by a decrease in temperature. The MOF exhibited preferential CO2 adsorption based on the high enthalpy of adsorption and adsorption selectivities of CO2 over N2 and CH4. Kinetics of adsorption and desorption of CO2 (308K\u2013338\u00a0K, pressures up to 1\u00a0bar) were fitted to the linear-driving force (LDF) kinetic model, showing a relatively fast adsorption and a low activation energy for adsorption and desorption. Diffusion inside the pores was found to be the rate-limiting step based on fits to the LDF model and the micropore diffusion model. Desorption kinetics studies at 1\u00a0bar indicated that CO2 has greater average residence times at all temperatures and lower values of activation energy for desorption than N2 and CH4. This suggests the selective adsorption and capture of CO2 on (1) will be favored.",

     "abstract": "The conventional thinking on CO2 utilization begins with the capture and concentration of CO2 from an emitting source. Here we propose the concept of a CO2-neutral chemicals production process comprising a network of reactions, which begin with the oxy-combustion of methane, the energy source for the process, and end with the production of chemicals with significant global demands. The proposed framework derives all its energy demand from methane and converts excess energy to electricity, and CO2 produced is converted to useful chemicals. The proposed concept provides a framework to obtain an optimistic estimate for the global impact of CO2 utilization subject to the maximum current and projected global demands for all chosen chemicals. Crucially, hydrogen produced internally in the process is not sufficient to achieve both CO2 neutrality and meet global demands for the chosen chemicals. Thus, based on the source of hydrogen, we present results from three different scenarios. First, we assumed unlimited renewable hydrogen supply. In this scenario, the estimated CO2 avoidance was 59% for the 2013 emission levels. The CO2 avoidance dropped dramatically to 6% in the second scenario, which assumed renewable energy at its current global levels. Finally, if the process were limited by the internally produced hydrogen only, then the CO2 avoidance reduced to 1%. Thus, the potential of CO2 utilization depends on the availability of renewable hydrogen.",

     "abstract": "Direct conversion of CO2 into CO and O2 was carried out in a cylindrical dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures. The influence of plasma processing parameters (e.g. discharge frequency, CO2 flow rate, discharge power, discharge length, discharge gap, and dielectric material\u2019s thickness) on the plasma CO2 conversion and energy efficiency of the process was investigated. The major products of this reaction were CO and O2, which suggests the stoichiometric conversion of CO2 into CO and O2 was achieved. The results indicate that discharge frequency has a negligible influence on the conversion of CO2 at a constant discharge power. Increasing discharge power or decreasing feed flow rate enhanced CO2 conversion but lowered the energy efficiency when all other parameters were kept constant. In addition, decreasing the discharge gap and the dielectric material\u2019s thickness, or enlarging the discharge length, increased both conversion of CO2 and process efficiency. Two regression models for the plasma process were developed to elucidate the relative significance of these plasma processing parameters on the plasma conversion of CO2. It was found that the flow rate of CO2 and discharge power play the most important role in CO2 conversion, while the energy efficiency is most significantly influenced by the discharge power. Modification of the plasma design was explored by using different inner and outer electrodes in the DBD system. The combination of the Al foil outer electrode with the stainless steel (SS) screw-type inner electrode showed an enhanced CO2 conversion and energy efficiency compared to other electrode forms, leading to the maximum CO2 conversion of 27.2% and maximum energy efficiency of 10.4% in this work. The use of the SS screw-type inner electrode could lead to an enhanced local electric field near the sharp edge of the electrode, while the use of Al foil as an outer electrode could enlarge the effectiveness of discharge area compared to the mesh electrode. Both effects contributed to the enhanced efficiency of the plasma CO2 conversion.",

There is an optimum amount of incorporated co-monomer and initiator which led to high adsorptive activity of the material towards CO2. Atmospheric CO2 adsorption was enhanced by the addition of amine moieties while maintaining an optimum surface area and pore volume. A certain amount of initiator led to better incorporation of VT monomer while surface area and pores remain accessible. A maximum CO2 adsorption of 2.65\u00a0mmolg-1 at 273\u00a0K/1\u00a0bar was achieved for triazole based adsorbent (PDVB-VT) with 0.7\u00a0g of VT and 0.07\u00a0g of initiator. In comparison with a non-functionalized material (PDVB) with 1.2\u00a0mmolg-1 CO2 uptake, the adsorption efficiency was enhanced more than twice. The adsorbent maintained its efficiency up to seven cycles.

Remarkable adsorption enhancements were observed when the adsorbents were exposed to a SH of 3.8\u201311.5\u00a0mg H2O/g at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Further increase of the SH above 11.5\u00a0mg H2O/g either decreased the CO2 uptake for branched PEI or had no additional benefit for linear PEI. Increasing the loading of PEI in the adsorbent resulted in an increase in water adsorption. However, branched PEI was more hydrophilic than its linear counterpart. Replacing the hydrophilic fumed silica support with a hydrophobic silica support decreased the overall water uptake while maintaining similar CO2 capture capacity. Considering that these types of adsorbents are designed to be recycled preferably for thousands of adsorption/desorption cycles, this could translate into significant energy savings in the regeneration step where any water present on the adsorbent would also have to be heated and desorbed.",

To this purpose, ten faujasite structures with different Al content were selected, and the best conditions for CO2 capture maximization have been calculated for each structure. Further results show that zeolites having intermediate Al content are the most effective for VSA processes, whereas low Al content faujasites perform better at PSA conditions. Remarkably, present work best results clearly improve Faujasite 13X VSA\u2013PSA performances, so far considered the industrial reference in absence of water. Moreover, combined VPSA processes, in terms of working capacity and adiabatic work required for compression/expansion, have also been studied, showing that VPSA systems are more efficient than pure PSA/VSA, for structures with intermediate Al content. Finally, an improved methodology has been derived, where GCMC mixture isotherms and energetic cost calculations are combined, and a more accurate way of estimating working capacities and breakthrough times is proposed. This new approach allows more realistic evaluations of adsorbents\u2019 performances, than those found in the literature based on pure adsorption data.",

This paper describes a new technology designed to increase the permeability of coal seams using the phase energy of CO2. The technology, named as liquid carbon dioxide phase change fracturing technology, is classified as physical blasting. The kernel of this technology is the blasting system, which consists of release tube containing release holes, cutting plate, liquid storage tube containing heating pipe, guide tube and detonator following the order from the top to the bottom. By starting the detonator, special chemicals in the heating pipe begin to react and a lot of heats then are released instantly to heat the liquid carbon dioxide in liquid storage tube. This process brought about the phase change of carbon dioxide and then caused the dramatically expansion of the volume of carbon dioxide. When the pressure of carbon dioxide in the liquid storage tube exceeds the strength of the cutting plate, the cutting plate is damaged and high pressure carbon dioxide enters the release tube and acts on the coal body. The sphere of influence of this technology in coal seams was studied by the numerical study. Then, a large-scale industrial experiment using the technology was conducted in an underground coal mine in China based on the modeling results. Application of this technology could not only improve the efficiency of coal seam gas extraction but could also turn carbon dioxide into energy to improve energy efficiency.",

CO is a reaction partner with hydrogen (H2) to produce gas and fuel. This paper elaborates an improved method to produce methane (CH4) by plasma induced dissociation of carbon dioxide and H2 in one single setup. A low pressure glow discharge plasma with an integrated zirconia based ion conductor transports oxygen ions (O2\u2212) in or out of the reaction chamber. Transporting oxygen ions into the reaction chamber is a way to have a controlled amount of water vapor for the conducted experiments. In contrast, leads the reduced amount of O2 ions to a theoretical decrease in the recombination of CO and O2 to CO2 in the ionized gas and therefore increases the CO2 conversion rate. The applied voltage to the ion conductor for the outward ion transportation and the power of the plasma source current have a major impact on the amount of extracted O2\u2212 ions. The effect of these parameters on the CO production rate and the formation of methane are investigated. A positive effect of the plasma current on the amount of CO and CH4 is detected. The influence of the temperature increase from the heated ion conductor relates to an undesired increase of the recombination rate of CO and O2 to CO2, but has a positive effect on the methanation.",

The morphology of the solid-state PCL was also investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The effects of both the physical state and the adsorption process conditions on the PCL's CO2 sorption capabilities were investigated as well as those concerning the cyclic life and the regeneration process.

The CO2 absorption capacity was analyzed with thermal gravimetric analyzer, and the absorption kinetics were compared with rate constant derived by using linear driving force model. According to the change of metal types among Li, Na, K and Ca while variation of the composition in MgO/carbonate/nitrate, CO2 absorption capacity and kinetics were changed dramatically. MgO promoted with CaCO3 and NaNO3 (MC0.19N0.20) was the best sorbent showing 30.3\u00a0wt%, but significant decrease in absorption capacity was observed during three cycles. MgO promoted with Na2CO3 and NaNO3 (MN0.19N0.15) exhibited the largest rate constant of 0.811\u00a0min\u22121, whereas other sorbents are distributed down to 0.046\u00a0min\u22121. In view of sorbent stability, MgO with K2CO3 and KNO3 (MK0.40K0.03) might be good sorbents since they showed very stable absorption/regeneration performances without significant decrease in working capacity during 10 cycles. The present result on the MgO-based sorbent preparation and CO2 absorption performances would provide important selection criteria for MgO-based dry sorbents based on high working capacity, rapid absorption rate, and stability showing stable absorption/regeneration reversibility.",

The results show that the support pore size impacts the size of Fe2O3 particles formed in the catalyst; increasing pore size of Al2O3 supports led to increased size of Fe2O3 particles formed in the pores. Catalyst pore sizes of 7\u201310\u00a0nm and the corresponding Fe2O3 particle sizes of 5\u20138\u00a0nm were the most active for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons.

Compared to waterflood and thermal recovery processes, primary processes such as CHOPS have relatively low energy and emission intensities; in other words, they can be considered as relatively \u2018clean\u2019 fossil fuel energy recovery processes. However, with recovery factors between 5 and 15% at the end of its economic life, there is a search for follow-up processes that yield additional oil from these reservoirs with continued low energy and emission intensities. One option is CO2-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes \u2013 CO2 can lower oil viscosity and if some fraction of the injected CO2 is sequestered in the reservoir, then the process can be considered a CO2 storage process in addition to an oil follow-up recovery process. Here, we evaluate the energy return and CO2 sequestered in cyclic CO2 and cyclic CO2-hot water injection processes in a post-CHOPS heavy oil field. The results reveal that overall recovery factors can be raised through appropriate design of the CO2 follow-up process. Cyclic CO2 injection achieves an incremental 2.4% recovery factor (over four years of operation) with high energy return ratio whereas CO2-hot water processes achieve higher recovery factors with lower energy return ratios. In these processes, the amount of CO2 that remains sequestered in the reservoir is small, typically less than 5%. Thus, these EOR processes are not strong candidates for CO2 sequestration.",

CO2 adsorption experiments on Na-X and Na-MOR zeolites were made in static conditions with pure CO2 and in dynamic conditions with N2/CO2 mixtures. CO2 desorption experiments were also made in pure N2 flow. IR experiments of CO2 adsorption on dry and wet surfaces were performed. Over both zeolites, when dry, CO2 is adsorbed reversibly at r.t. in a linear way, as molecular CO2 interacting with Na+ ions in a 1:1 or 2:1 CO2:Na+ ratio. Over both zeolites, non-linear species also form, i.e. either carbonate-like species or bent CO2 molecules, or even both. These species are held more strongly and are only desorbed by flowing nitrogen at 373\u00a0K. The faujasite zeolite Na-X displays a higher adsorption capacity at high CO2 partial pressures with respect to Na-MOR, essentially due to the greater amount of active Na+ ions associated to the lower Si/Al ratio in Na-X. CO2 adsorption on Na-MOR is strongly diminished when the feed contains 3% water, while on Na-X CO2 adsorption is slightly enhanced at high P CO 2 (60\u201380%) in wet feed. The IR spectra show that in Na-X CO2 is absorbed as free hydrogencarbonate ion in water clusters adsorbed into the faujasite cavities. This is not found for Na-MOR.",

Amorphous oxides of magnetite/maghemite and crystalline CuO and Cu2O oxides obtained by different methodologies were also studied. Previously, the efficiency of the catalysts for the hydrogen formation was evaluated in 0.1\u00a0M NaHCO3 since it takes place as a competitive reaction during CO2 reduction in aqueous electrolytes. By comparison of the voltammograms in the absence and presence of CO2, an inhibition of the hydrogen evolution was showed for all (metal and oxide-based) catalysts due to the adsorption of species from CO2 reduction (CO2,red). Interestingly, the CO2,red formation on Co and Fe-surfaces operating under these conditions has not been stated before. A strong current decrease, and consequently, a higher adsorbate amount, was observed on copper-oxides (75\u201385%) vs. the metal catalyst (45%).",

At 273\u00a0K and 1\u00a0bar only micropores in the range of 0.30\u20130.86\u00a0nm were mainly effective for CO2 adsorption. When the temperature increased to 298\u00a0K, the ranges of effective micropores for CO2 adsorption at 1\u00a0bar decreased to 0.30\u20130.33\u00a0nm. For the typical flue gas conditions (partial pressure of CO2 0.15\u00a0bar), micropores in the range of 0.30\u20130.57\u00a0nm were mainly effective for CO2 adsorption.

Activated carbon prepared from pomegranate peels showed the highest CO2 adsorption and selectivity (CO2/N2). The experimental isotherm data of activated carbon produced from pomegranate peels were analysed using Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, and Toth isotherm equations. The fitting details showed that the multitemperature Toth equation is a powerful tool to mathematically represent CO2 isotherms on activated carbon produced from pomegranate peels. The isosteric heat of adsorption was calculated by fitting the Toth equation to the adsorption isotherms and applying the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation.

As synthesized catalysts were characterized using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and cyclic voltammetry studies. By comparing voltammetry results it is found that 20\u00a0wt% Sn catalyst is electrochemically more active towards CO2 reduction than other lower and higher loadings of Sn on both the supports. The reason for such observation is explained based on physical characterization of \u03b3-Al2O3 and ZSM5. In 20\u00a0wt% Sn catalyst, the Sn remains in dispersed form adhering to the porous wall of \u03b3-Al2O3 and ZSM5 satifying percolation limit. Whereas, at lower loadings, electronic connectivity between Sn particles are lost and, at higher loadings, Sn particles agglomerate blocking the pores of the support. Reduction of CO2 using 20Sn/Al2O3 and 20Sn/ZSM5 catalyst is found to be selective towards methane and carbon monoxide formation from the product analysis of the electroreduction cell using gas chromatograph.

However, in the absence of demand market and a revenue source for the recovered almost-pure CO2, the remained option, i.e. storage, does not seem to justify the economic feasibility of this climate change mitigation approach.In our current integration study, we consider existence of a Fischer-Tropsch Gas-to-liquid (GTL) plant in the vicinity of a fossil-fuel based power plant.

We have presented a few case-studies based on optimal process simulation in Aspen Hysys software package.

The results for a 300\u00a0MW coal-fired plant, and a GTL plant with the capacity of one train of Sasol Oryx GTL plant in Qatar show that an auto-thermal reformer (ATR) based GTL process does not have flexibility for CO2 intake, while all of the captured CO2 fed into the steam-methane reformer (SMR) process could be consumed.

     "abstract": "To alleviate disposal burden of contaminated wood at landfills, construction wood waste can be recycled into cement-bonded particleboards, however, their qualities are often compromised by organic extractives and preservative chemicals in wood. In contrast to traditional approaches using phenol formaldehyde resin or chloride accelerator, this study proposed the use of eco-friendly CO2 curing and fibre reinforcement to accelerate carbonation and enhance physical properties of the particleboards. Cement chemistry and microstructure characteristics were evaluated by using quantitative X-ray diffraction, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The 24-h CO2 curing significantly facilitated cement hydration (i.e., more than 63\u00a0wt% amorphous cement hydrate) and accelerated Ca(OH)2 transformation into CaCO3, which contributed to strength development and carbon sequestration (as high as 9.2\u00a0wt%) in the particleboards. Consequently, the total pore area was reduced from 12.2 to 10.3\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121 and porosity from 34.8 to 29.7%. A subsequent 7-d air curing allowed cement rehydration and densified micropore structure, especially for capillary pores. As a result, mechanical strength, dimensional stability, and contaminants sequestration were enhanced to fulfil the requirement of International Standards. The results also illustrated the vital role of moisture content of particleboards in cement hydration and accelerated carbonation, for which the moisture content ranging from 16.7% to 17.9% was considered optimal. The addition of grid basalt fibre (0.5% by wood volume) enhanced the fracture energy of the particleboards by 6.5 times. This study presents a low-carbon and environmentally-friendly technology to upcycle construction wood waste into value-added materials in a sustainable way.",

Standardized tests deemed the synthetic aggregate comparable in performance to commercial granite and Litex\u00ae lightweight aggregates. Compressive strength of concretes prepared using these artificial aggregates, where some specimens were further cured by carbonation, performed favorably against reference benchmark concretes. A standard full-size 20-cm concrete masonry block prepared in the manner prescribed can permanently store 2.93\u00a0kg of CO2, outweighing its embodied carbon footprint.

A bimetal electrocatalyst is synthesized by Co and Ag metals to investigate the effect of the bimetal over gas phase CO2 electrochemical reduction. It is found that though the chosen metals are individually selective for the CO formation but the combination results in CH4 and C2H4 formation along with CO.

Although the mechanisms of the fixation of CO2 catalyzed by various room-temperature ionic liquids or functionalized ionic liquids have been theoretically elucidated in previous literatures, it is not totally suitable for the amino-functionalized ionic liquid. First, the 1-(3-aminopropyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([APmim]Cl) would react with CO2 to produce the 1-(3-carbamic acid propyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([CAPmim]Cl). Then, [APmim]Cl, [CAPmim]Cl, and combination of them would be employed as the catalyst leading to nine possible routes. Different from the previous work, this work allows a better comprehension of the mechanism by means of a new model that the cooperative effect of two same or different components is considered. Both the interaction between catalyst and reactant and the influence between different catalytic components are considered. Besides the nucleophilic attack of the Cl\u2212 anion, the [CAPmim]+ cation is taken as the main component to activate the O atom of PO directly leading to the ring-opening. The [APmim]+ cation is utilized to stabilize the [CAPmim]+, which is the most favorable route. The noncovalent interactions (NCI) plot is employed as a tool to analyze the reason of the higher catalytic efficiency of top three favorable routes.

The results showed that the use of pyridine-based soluble co-catalysts lowered the overpotential for the electrochemical reduction of CO2, enhancing also reaction performance (i.e. reaction rate and Faradaic efficiency).

It was found that the proposed model can not only reasonably interpret observed test phenomena but also has the intrinsic ability to extrapolate adsorption isotherms under different temperatures beyond test data. The crossovers of the observed adsorption isotherms under different temperatures can be simply attributed to the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) behavior of the bulk gas during the adsorption process. Both the temperature dependence and adsorption uptake dependence of isosteric heat of adsorption are revealed; the higher the temperature and the adsorption uptake, the lower the isosteric heat of adsorption. The ideal gas law overestimates the isosteric heat of adsorption for scCO2 in coal.

Different types of micro algal species have got CO2 tolerance to a different level. This work focuses on the tolerance capability of Oscillatoria sp. for 100% CO2, bubbled into the ASN III media. CO2 supply was given at a flow rate of 300\u00a0ml/min for 15\u00a0min. 12:12\u00a0h of light to dark cycle was followed.CO2 supply was varied from one to three times a day during the light period. An increasing trend of biomass growth was observed with increased supply frequency of CO2. An increase of biomass yield of 44.7%, CO2 fixation of 64.2% and calorific value of 17.6% was observed corresponding to the three times supply frequency of CO2, compared with the control. Ultimate analysis, stoichiometric analysis and molecular weight of microalgae grown in control and pure CO2 (100%) gas were compared. Growth of microalgae obtained at various supply frequencies of CO2 were fitted with logistic model with a correlation coefficient of 0.98. The present studies indicated that the Oscillatoria sp. was able to sustain in pure CO2(100%) gas and may be considered as the species for converting the emissions from the distilleries to energy.",

     "abstract": "In the context of the paradigm of Carbon Recovery and Re-utilization (or CRR), this work investigates the role of electrochemical generators (such as high-temperature fuel cells) to perform CRR as a practical secondary effect.In fact, the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating principle is inherently beneficial toward CO2 separation from the exhaust gas since the fuel is electrochemically oxidized resulting in no N2 mixing at the anode (fuel) electrode. An oxy-combustor downstream the fuel cell will complete the residual fuel (mostly H2 and CO) oxidation to yield a stream that contains only H2O and CO2. After water condensation and further drying, the captured CO2 is fed to a photobioreactor that can fix carbon into microalgae.In this work, results of the first SOFC-based poly-generation system with complete CO2 recovery in the form of fast-growing biomass (micro-algae) are presented, as developed in the EU-funded project SOFCOM (GA 278798, www.sofcom.eu).The overall plant layout is described, and results on the performance of the proof-of-concept plant units are provided.",

     "abstract": "Electrochemical reduction of CO2 has been pointed out as an interesting strategy to convert CO2 into useful chemicals. In addition, coupling CO2 electroreduction with renewable energies would allow storing electricity from intermittent renewable sources such as wind or solar power. In this work, an easy and fast method is adapted for the synthesis of pure and carbon supported Sn nanoparticles. The resulting nanoparticles have been characterized by transmission electron microscopy and their electrocatalytic properties towards CO2 reduction evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Carbon supported Sn nanoparticles have been subsequently used to prepare Gas Diffusion Electrodes (Sn/C-GDEs). The electrodes have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy and also by cyclic voltammetry. Finally, the electrodes were tested on a continuous and single pass CO2 electroreduction filter-press type cell system in aqueous solution, to obtain formate at ambient pressure and temperature. These Sn/C-GDEs allow working at high current densities with low catholyte flow. Thus, for instance, at 150\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, a 70% Faradaic Efficiency (FE) was obtained with a formate concentration of 2.5\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121.

Despite the high concentrations obtained, further research is still required to keep high FE operating at high current densities.",

The combination of scCO2 and H2O was confirmed to be effective for the production of PAP.

Under the optimal reaction conditions, a high yield to PAP (68.9%) was achieved at the high conversion of NB (98.5%).

Ag-NPs were photo-deposited over the TiO2 NWs and characterized by XRD, TEM, N2-adsorption-desorption, XPS, UV\u2013vis and PL spectroscopy. Ag-NPs in metal-state were successfully coated on the TiO2 NWs surface, producing core-shell hetero-junction. Ag-NPs coated over TiO2 NWs exhibited strong absorption of visible light due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation, trapped electrons and hindered charges recombination rate. The synergistic effect of Ag-NPs coated over TiO2 NWs for CO2 conversion was evaluated in a gas-phase system under UV and visible light irradiation. The plasmonic Ag-NPs/TiO2 NWs demonstrated excellent photoactivity in the reduction of CO2 into CO, CH4 and CH3OH under visible light irradiation. The results show that 3\u00a0wt.% Ag-NPs-loaded TiO2 NWs was found to be the most active, giving the highest CO evolution of 983\u00a0\u03bcmole-g-catal.\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 at selectivity 98%. This amount of CO produced was 23 times more than the TiO2 NWs and 109 times larger than the yield of CO produced over the pure TiO2. More importantly, the quantum yield was substantially enhanced for CO evolution. The LSPR excitation and synergic effect of Ag-NPs which can effectively accelerate the charge separation was proposed to be responsible for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The photo-stability of Ag-NPs/TiO2 NWs evidenced in cyclic runs for selective CO production under visible light, yet photoactivity declined over the irradiation time under UV-light.

The Cu-metal loaded over TiO2 and g-C3N4 enhanced CO2 reduction efficiency to CH3OH and HCOOH by fostering carrier charge separation. The Cu-metal in the composite as well as the wt.% ratio of g-C3N4 and TiO2 also influenced the photoactivity and products selectivity. The low band gap, electronic structure and visible light absorption capacity of g-C3N4 facilitated the transfer of photo-generated electrons to Cu/TiO2 in the composite. Moreover, the position of the metal in the composite affected the electrons distribution and hence enhanced the photoactivity. The maximum yield of the products detected under visible light were 2574 and 5069\u00a0\u03bcmol/g.cat of CH3OH and HCOOH, respectively. The yield of CH3OH under visible light was four fold higher compared to UV-light irradiation. The ratio (30:70) of g-C3N4 and Cu/TiO2 in the composite and the use of visible light improved the efficiency of the photocatalytic system. The stability of the photocatalyst prevailed in continuous CH3OH production under visible light irradiation compared to UV-light in cyclic runs.

The high CO2 uptake is attributed to the strong interaction between one-sided N-CNS and CO2 molecules and its tunable space. Because one-sided N-CNS has greater interactions with CO2 molecules than N2 molecules, due to the quadrupole moment of CO2 molecules, it shows the impressive selectivity of CO2/N2.

Afterwards, Diels-Alder (DA) adducts were synthesized by the reaction between a bismaleimide and FGE or FCE. The DA adducts were characterized by 1H NMR and FTIR. Amine-curing of the adducts produced two different networks. According to dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, the existence of the cyclocarbonate ring resulted in the formation of a more flexible network having less cross-link density in comparison with its epoxy counterpart. Thermal behavior of the DA adducts were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed a retro-DA process occurred at \u223c130\u00a0\u00b0C. Unlike the epoxy network, molecular disconnection of the NIPU network occurred completely at this temperature after 25\u00a0min.

We show the wide, portfolio of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that can be produced by controlling the electrolysis conditions in this one-pot synthesis. For example solid core carbon nanofibers are formed with C-13 isotope CO2, whereas hollow core CNTs are formed with natural abundance CO2 (which contains 99% C-12 and 1% C-13). Shown are the first doped electrosynthesized carbon nanotubes, prepared with added electrolytic LiBO2 for boron doping, and salts for phosphorous, nitrogen or sulfur CNT doping is probed. Boron doping greatly enhances conductivity of the CNTs. Electrolytic CaCO3 produces thin-walled CNTs, while excess electrolytic oxide yields tangled CNTs. Addition of up to 50 mol% Na2CO3 to a Li2CO3 electrolyte, decreases electrolyte costs and improves conditions for intercalation in Na-ion CNT anodes. Addition of BaCO3 increases electrolyte density. Longer electrolysis time leads to proportionally wider diameter CNTs. Synthetic components (steel cathode, nickel anode and inorganic carbonate electrolyte) are available and inexpensive. Advantages include (1) production is limited only by the cost of electrons (electricity) providing a substantial cost reduction compared to conventional CVD and polymer spinning syntheses and (2) the only reactant consumed in the formation of the CNTs is CO2, transforming this greenhouse gas into a stable, valuable product and providing an economic incentive to the removal of anthropogenic CO2 from flue gas or from the atmosphere.",

The FER zeolite was seen to ensure a better dispersion of cluster oxides, favouring the generation of Lewis basic sites for CO2 activation along with a higher availability of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites for the MeOH-to-DME dehydration step. The catalytic results clearly evidenced a net difference in behaviour among the investigated hybrid systems, both in terms of CO2 conversion and product distribution. Peculiar structure-activity relationships highlighted the superior performance of CuZnZr-FER catalyst, allowing to reach the highest DME productivity value (\u2248600\u00a0gDME/kgcat/h), as the consequence of better efficiency in mass transferring ensured by neighbouring active sites involved in the reaction mechanism. The stability test evidenced a progressive deactivation not associated to coke deposition or metal sintering, but mainly to water formation which negatively affects the behaviour both of metal-oxide and acid sites controlling the DME synthesis rate.",

In this survey, the hybrid process on NG treatment is studied. The hybrid process combines membrane and amine processes to utilize their both advantages. Three different sweetening processes are considered here: amine solutions (30\u00a0wt.% diethanolamine (DEA)), membrane process (hollow fiber membrane (HFM) approach), and hybrid process (amine\u00a0+\u00a0membrane). Membrane process was first used to remove acid gases from NG, and amine process was further used to complete purification to come across pipeline standards. Economic factors involved in the prediction of separation costs includes capital recovery cost, expenses concern to hydrocarbon losses, and operating expenses such as maintenance cost, labor cost, energy cost and replacement cost of membrane. For amine process, most separation cost depends on operating cost specifically energy cost and least separation cost is dependent to hydrocarbon losses, also for membrane process most separation cost and least separation cost are dependent on hydrocarbon losses and capital recovery cost, respectively. The simulation was also implemented for NGL-1200 (GOGPC, Iran) plant to find whether the same modeling is responsible for an industrial unit.",

Different chemical production conditions were compared by modelling a 1000\u00a0t per year production plant. Three sustainability indicators; net energy consumption (NEC), energy gain (EG) and global warming ratio (GWR), were used; along with three economic indicators: production cost, pay-back period and discounted cash flow rate of return. NEC analysis revealed substantial energy requirements in the MES reactor and rectification unit. The former due to the energy required to synthesise CO2to longer chains and the later due to increased water molecules formed during synthesis. EG values suggested that producingformic acid and methanol using MES were lower than conventional processes. MES was shown to use more carbon dioxide for methanol, ethanol and formic acid synthesis than those produced. The economic analysis showed that formic acid and ethanol had a long pay-back period of 15 years. However, production costs were found to be competitive with the market only for formic acid (0.30\u00a0\u00a3/kg) and ethanol (0.88\u00a0\u00a3/kg). Moreover, high returns were evaluated for formic acid (21%) and ethanol (14%) compared to the minimum requirements of the industry (11.60%) making these products economically attractive. Our findings reveal insights about the use and scale up of MES for a sustainable and economically viable chemical production process.",

The characterization of the catalyst showed the formation of an iron manganese oxide phase, in the absence of the start-up solvent. Modeling and kinetic analysis of the data suggested that the start-up solvent decreased oxidation of the catalyst phase by reducing water adsorption, thereby increasing the Fischer-Tropsch reaction rate. This led to an increase in hydrocarbon yield in the presence of mineral oil.",

The experimental data for oxidation and reduction indicated reaction mechanisms, which are well described by a reaction order and a geometrical contraction model. After parameter estimation, a good agreement between the model and the TG data was achieved with the reaction order and geometrical contraction model for oxidation and reduction, respectively.

The electrocatalytic activity of the complex was investigated for CO2 reduction under different reaction conditions. The results show that the CO2 reduction peak current increases with increasing concentration of the electrocatalyst from 0.5 to 2\u00a0mM, increasing purging time of CO2 from 5 to 30\u00a0min, and increasing scan rate from 0.1 to 0.5\u00a0V\u00a0s\u22121.

     "abstract": "Dry reforming of methane is one of the few chemical reactions which can effectively convert carbon dioxide (CO2), a major green-house gas, into a valuable chemical precursor, syngas (a mixture of CO and H2), that can be converted into chemicals and fuels via different synthesis routes such as the Fischer Tropsch synthesis. The inherent limitations of dry reforming reaction, for instance, rapid catalyst deactivation by coke deposition and the very high energy requirements, has restricted its use as a commercial technology. This study was performed to evaluate the potential of overcoming the limitations of dry reforming by integrating it with other commercial methane reforming technologies such as steam reforming and partial oxidation reforming in the context of industrial operating conditions. A thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of the combined reforming has been conducted using the software suite MATLAB\u00ae. The aim of this complicated assessment is to identify optimized combination of the three reformers and also the corresponding operating conditions that would utilize significant amount of CO2 while ensuring CO2 fixation, minimum carbon formation and optimum energy requirements. The thermodynamic equilibrium product distribution calculations involved the Peng Robinson (PR), Redlich Kwong (RK) and Soave Redlich Kwong (SRK) equations of state (EOS) to identify the best EOS that accounts for the non-ideality associated with the high pressure operation. The study evaluated simultaneous effects of temperature (200\u00a0\u00b0C\u20131200\u00a0\u00b0C), pressure (1\u201320\u00a0bar) and feed mole ratios (of methane, steam, carbon dioxide and oxygen) on the equilibrium product distribution. The addition of oxygen and steam to dry reforming helped in decreasing energy requirements while simultaneously increasing the syngas yield ratio (H2:CO ratio). The numerical evaluation revealed an optimized operating condition of \u223c750\u00a0\u00b0C at 1\u00a0bar pressure at a feed mole ratio CH4:H2O:O2:CO2 of 1:0.4:0.3:1. For this optimization, the system boundaries were limited only to a reformer block without considering the upstream and dowstream processes. At this optimized condition, the carbon deposition was eliminated and the CO2 conversion was observed to be 47.84% with an energy requirement of 180.26\u00a0kJ. The study is further extended to include kinetic analysis of combined dry and steam reforming of methane. The preliminary findings of kinetic evaluation indicated an excellent agreement between combined kinetic model with the thermodynamic equilibrium results.",

Using the Aspen Plus process simulation software, this work simulates a novel process for the mineral carbonation of phosphogypsum with ammonia under increased CO2 pressure. This process is divided into five sections, namely, pre-carbonation, enhanced carbonation, flash separation, gas phase absorption, and (NH4)2SO4 fertilizer production. With its large-scale application, this new process allows the sensitivity analysis of many operation conditions, identifies the optimal conditions for reducing the ammonia and energy consumption of (NH4)2SO4 fertilizer production, and achieves a high carbonation conversion with a fast reaction rate. The optimal conditions (6\u00a0bar enhanced carbonation pressure, 1\u00a0bar flash pressure, 38\u00a0\u00b0C ammonia absorption solution temperature, 1.05 ammonia excess ratio, 1.024 CO2 excess ratio, and 0.94 mass ratio of water to gypsum) yield the highest carbonation conversion, ammonia utilization ratio, and enhanced carbonation temperature of 99.9%, 95.2%, and 138.5\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, all of which can help achieve a fast carbonation reaction rate.",

These catalyst materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 physisorption, H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) techniques. It was found that the concentration of O2\u2212 anions on the flower-like Al2O3 surface was significantly higher than that on the commercial Al2O3 surface, leading to large amounts of highly dispersed FexOy clusters on flower-like Al2O3 in contrast with large Fe2O3 particles mainly present on commercial Al2O3. A possible formation mechanism of the small FexOy clusters was proposed. The catalytic results indicated that the highly dispersed FexOy clusters possessed an excellent catalytic activity, since the ethylbenzene conversion over Fe2O3/flower-like Al2O3 was 1.6 times higher than that over Fe2O3/commercial Al2O3.

By utilising waste heat from industrial processes or solar concentrators or nuclear reactors, HT-SOE devices can reduce the electrical energy input up to 30%. Thus such devices are attractive for utilising CO2 as a renewable energy storage media when coupled with Solar Concentrator Photovoltaic systems. Application of traditional solid oxide fuel cell electrodes such as Ni-YSZ restricts the operation of the electrolyser to using CO2 mixed with reducing gases such as hydrogen or CO to prevent re-oxidation of metallic Ni to NiO in the presence of CO2. Furthermore carbon deposition can occur at high current densities in dry CO2. New redox stable ceramic cathodes (CO2 electrode) are promising alternatives to Ni-YSZ electrodes. In this work, we report electrochemical performance of Palladium (Pd) doped La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3\u2212\u1d79 (LSCF-Pd) as potential cathode for these devices.

Among various CCS strategies, biological CCS microalgal cell factories have emerged as important CO2 sequestration platform.

Although, photocatalysis demands significantly less energy, it has several problem issues; slower production rate, consumption of sacrificial donors or need for expensive noble metals. Here, we report substantial increase in the rate of hydrogen evolution without the use of sacrificial donors or noble metals. We demonstrate appreciable hydrogen generation by coupling biomimetic carbonation with common metal driven plasmonic photocatalysis. Our process has three parts. First, zinc leads to the formation of Zn/ZnO composite, which acts as the proximate photocatalyst. Second, specific illumination operates on the composite via Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), a phenomenon in which photons activated nanoparticles exhibit local heating, concentration and redistribution of the incident light and release of electrons. Third, carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the hydrolysis of water by CO2 to provide both protons and bicarbonate ions critical to the process. In sum, protons derived from water combine with electrons derived photocatalytically from Zn/ZnO to yield hydrogen. Only photons and water are consumed and only hydrogen is produced. The SPR sensitive Zn/ZnO composite generates hydrogen evolution at a rate of 1238\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0h\u22121, an unprecedented enhancement (16.7-fold) over zinc micro particles \u2212 Zn(M) alone.

     "abstract": "CO2 conversion into value-added chemicals is gaining increasing interest in recent years, and a gliding arc plasma has great potential for this purpose, because of its high energy efficiency. In this study, a chemical reaction kinetics model is presented to study the CO2 splitting in a gliding arc discharge. The calculated conversion and energy efficiency are in good agreement with experimental data in a range of different operating conditions. Therefore, this reaction kinetics model can be used to elucidate the dominant chemical reactions contributing to CO2 destruction and formation. Based on this reaction pathway analysis, the restricting factors for CO2 conversion are figured out, i.e., the reverse reactions and the small treated gas fraction. This allows us to propose some solutions in order to improve the CO2 conversion, such as decreasing the gas temperature, by using a high frequency discharge, or increasing the power density, by using a micro-scale gliding arc reactor, or by removing the reverse reactions, which could be realized in practice by adding possible scavengers for O atoms, such as CH4. Finally, we compare our results with other types of plasmas in terms of conversion and energy efficiency, and the results illustrate that gliding arc discharges are indeed quite promising for CO2 conversion, certainly when keeping in mind the possible solutions for further performance improvement.",

     "abstract": "Geological CO2 sequestration is one of the most effective methods to counter global climate change. Coal matrix shrinkage, swelling, gas diffusion and permeability are the key phenomena associated with geological CO2 disposal in coal. In this study, permeability experiments were approached using the supercritical and liquid phases of CO2 (less understood; most likely insitu phases) for naturally fractured bituminous coal. Experiments were performed under triaxial conditions using four sets of various confinement conditions corresponding to variable depths. Injection pressure was varied gradually and the permeability changes were calculated using the Darcy\u2019s equation for subcritical and supercritical CO2 exclusively. Changes in CO2 phases were obtained by changing the system temperature from 26\u00b0 C for liquid CO2 to 34\u00a0\u00b0C for supercritical CO2. N2 was alternatively injected at the start and between the injections of CO2 to analyze the changes in the permeability from a relatively very less sorptive medium\u2019s perspective. It was observed that the supercritical CO2 flow reduced the permeability significantly and this behavior was greatly attributed to the highly viscous nature of the supercritical phase and the high volumetric deformation or the swelling of coal under supercritical CO2 as compared to liquid CO2. The injection pressures were observed to reduce the effective stress behavior, which in turn pushed the permeability evolution at each confinement to a positive trend. However, the permeability of CO2 reduced exponentially with increasing effective stresses. Two different empirical equations were proposed for permeability of both the phases of CO2 with effective stresses.",

The methanol selectivity for the catalyst with low total metal loading (9.94\u00a0wt.%) is much lower than those for other catalysts, though it increases with increasing loading, which can be mainly assigned to the much smaller Cu particle size (<5\u00a0nm) and the higher ratio of isolated CuO phase.

Furthermore, the NH3- and CO2- temperature programmed desorption studies showed that CZOx/Z has both acid and basic sites, but the acid sites were about four times higher.

Meanwhile, CO2 hydrogenation was conducted over a Cu-based catalysts in the methanol synthesis unit to directly produce the targeted product, methanol. After methanol synthesis, the unreacted syngas was recycled to the methanol synthesis and reforming units to enhance energy efficiency. The simulation results revealed that both CGTM options can favorably improve the energy efficiency and significantly reduce the total CO2 emissions, compared to a conventional GTM process. The energy efficiency was shown to be highly affected by the recycle ratio and a higher recycle ratio seemed to favorably improve CO2 conversion, enhance energy efficiency, and reduce CO2 emissions. However, the split ratio (recycle-to-reforming unit/total recycle) seems to have little effect on the energy efficiency, and the optimum recycle to the reforming unit was determined to be none.",

     "abstract": "A bifunctional 9\u00a0wt.%NiO-16\u00a0wt.%Fe2O3/MgAl2O4 material was prepared for CO2 conversion to CO by auto-thermal catalyst-assisted chemical looping. This process is designed to maximize CO2 conversion. The generation of CO from CO2 was investigated between 873\u00a0K and 1023\u00a0K. The high endothermicity of methane dry reforming and the material deactivation by coke deposition were avoided by the simultaneous feeding of CH4, CO2 and O2 in a 1:1:0.5 molar ratio during the reduction half-cycle of chemical looping. In this half-cycle, interaction of Ni with Fe leads to Ni-Fe alloy formation. The resulting Ni-based catalyst converts CH4\u00a0+\u00a0CO2\u00a0+\u00a0O2 into a mixture of CO and H2, which both reduce Fe3O4, producing CO2 and H2O. In the CO2 re-oxidation half-cycle, CO is produced and the Ni-Fe alloy decomposes into Ni and Fe3O4. The reduction capacity (Rc) of the gas mixture strongly depends on the ratio Rc between reducing and oxidizing gases. Based on thermodynamic calculations, high conversion of Fe3O4 to reduced state can be reached if Rc\u00a0>\u00a02 and T\u00a0>\u00a0873\u00a0K. During prolonged auto-thermal chemical looping at 1023\u00a0K, the 9\u00a0wt.%NiO\u201316\u00a0wt.%Fe2O3/MgAl2O4 suffers from deactivation in the first five cycles, after which a more stable operation is established. Based on TEM measurements, sintering was found to be the main cause for the initial decrease of CO production.",

In this work, potassium sarcosine solution was used for the first time as an absorbent for removing CO2 in HFMC. The performance regarding their absorbing quality of these amino acids was compared with renowned amines. The partial and ordinary equations were solved numerically in liquid, membrane and gas phases. The model results were validated using the available experimental data in the literature for PG, MEA, DEA and MDEA. The results showed that PG has a better performance when it comes to the absorption of CO2 in comparison to MDEA, DEA and PS at a relatively high CO2 partial pressures.

This study investigates the effect of iron (Fe) in the pH of three synthetic brines prepared as analogue to oil-field brine by combining a number of experimental and modelling tools to elucidate whether or not Fe speciation may affect the pH of brines. X-Ray powder Diffraction (XRD) analyses were also carried out to characterise the mineralogy of the synthetic brines. Results indicate that the Fe speciation affects the pH of oil-field brines; brines containing Fe3+ experiment a rapid increase of the pH as a consequence of Fe2O3 precipitation by aging of Fe(OH)3 under alkaline conditions. Brines containing Fe2+ show a sharp drop of the pH as a result of air oxidation of highly alkaline Fe(OH)2 suspension induced by KOH addition by means of dissolution-oxidation-crystallisation mechanism where particles of Fe(OH)2 provide the substrate for the \u03b3-FeO(OH) growth.

This study explores the techno-environmental performance of CO2 utilization trough dry reforming of methane into syngas for the production of dimethyl ether (DME). The CO2 source is a hydrogen production unit at a refinery, where solvent based CO2 capture is applied. Aspen+ modelling and hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to assess the techno-environmental performance of this utilization option compared to a reference case without CO2 capture and a case with CO2 capture and storage. Results of the technical assessment show that although 94% of the captured CO2 can be utilised for DME production, only 9% of CO2 is avoided in the entire process as a result of direct CO2 formation during DME synthesis and the combustion of syngas to provide the heat demanded by the dry reforming process. Besides, a substantial amount of electricity is required for syngas compression. Consequently, the LCA results indicate that climate change potential (CCP) is reduced by 8% while it is 37% higher than CCP when CO2 is stored and DME is produced conventionally. Sensitivity analyses are performed on various process conditions. Overall, this study indicates that this utilization route lowers the CCP although the reduction is limited compared to CCS. While the techno-environmental analysis is a useful tool to gain better insights in the performance of CO2 utilization options, the complex environmental trade-offs make it difficult to draw robust conclusions on the performance.",

     "abstract": "Nowadays, methanol has gained great importance as an alternative fuel and a product which can be considered as a CO2 utilization in novel processes; nevertheless, there is no adequate work on purge gas streams in current conventional methanol complexes. This study aims to specify main waste gasses in one of the biggest methanol plants in the world, located in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone of Iran. The calculations in this work show that every hour, 50106\u00a0Sm3 purge gas including unreacted gas (60% hydrogen, 17% CO and CO2, and 23% N2 and CH4) is burnt in the complex. A new process design has been proposed to recovery of available purge gasses in that methanol plant. The Auto-Thermal Reformer (ATR) of the complex has been modeled in detail and various cases were considered to analyze the effects of this new strategy. The results indicate noteworthy improvements in both quality and quantity of the produced synthesis gas by injecting the recoverable stream into the ATR. In this way, emission of 26.7 ton carbon dioxide per hour to the atmosphere is prevented and it converted to valuable methanol. This process can bring annual profit ranging from 20 to 40 million US dollars per year with the Rate of Return (ROR) between 29 and 56%.",

     "abstract": "The sustainability and sturdiness of cement based composite is increasingly coming to the forefront of infrastructural design, maintenance and as a green material that is environmentally benign. This paper seeks to develop a predictive mathematical global reaction rate model for atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration in sandcrete composite of cement, mineral kaolin as supplementary aggregate material (SAM), sand and water. Standard experimental techniques and procedures were used. MatCad Professional (R14) software was used to simulate the developed model equation. Results obtained indicate that the overall global reaction rates for CO2 sequestration was higher in both experimental and simulated for the developed sandcrete-kaolin (S-K) composite (9.064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 and 9.532\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0mol/kg\u00a0s) at 30\u00a0\u00b0C compared to the reference kaolin-free sandcrete (S-S) composite (4.058\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 and 4.056\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0mol/kg\u00a0s) at an early stage of setting (9\u00a0h). The quantity of carbon dioxide sequestered after 9\u00a0h of carbonation ranges between 0.0185\u20130.0214\u00a0kg/m3 for sandcrete-kaolin composite, while for the reference specimen it ranges from 0.0128 to 0.011\u00a0kg/m3 at 30\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C. The simulated results based on the developed overall global reaction rates compared strongly with the experimental in most of the parameters investigated. The mineralogical compositions and microstructure changes of the carbonated samples characterized using X-ray Diffractometer (XRD), X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Diffraction Spectrometer (EDS) showed that addition of mineral kaolin to sandcrete enhanced the rate of CO2 sequestration.",

A biological carbon capture and conversion has been considered in conventional anaerobic digestion processes. The process has been utilised in biological mixed culture, where acetoclastic bacteria and hydrogenophilic methanogens play a major key role in the utilisation of carbon dioxide. However, the bio catalytic microorganisms, hydrogenophilic methanogens are reported to be unstable with acetoclastic bacteria. In this work the biochemical thermodynamic efficiency was investigated for the stabilisation of the microbial process in carbon capture and utilisation. The authors observed that a thermodynamic efficiency of biological carbon capture and utilisation (BCCU) had 32% of overall reduction in yield of carbon dioxide with complimentary increase of 30% in yield of methane, while the process was overall endothermic. Total consumption of energy (\u22480.33\u00a0MJ\u00a0l\u22121) was estimated for the carbonate solubility (0.1\u00a0mol\u00a0l\u22121) in batched BCCU. This has a major influence on microbial composition in the bioreactor.

During the past decades, extensive studies have been conducted to identify the photocatalytic products of CO2 conversion and their reaction mechanisms. There is a need to propose a general mechanism pattern covering the results of these original researches. Among many factors affecting the redox reaction pathway, this paper focuses on the effect of reductant type as an important issue on the product diversity and selectivity of CO2 photocatalysis. We first tried to show the reaction mechanism of CO2 photocatalysis in the solitary presence of the most common reductants, H2, H2O (both gaseous and aqueous phases), CH4, and CH3OH. Then, a general mechanism has been suggested for CO2 conversion in the mixture of the reductants, based on the fact that in the photoreduction process of CO2, all of the reductants can be derived from one of them.",

In this research, the performances of Cu-ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst under magnetic field with different magnetic field intensities (0, 20.8, and 27.7\u00a0mT) and orientations (north-to-south (N-S) and south-to-north (S-N) directions) in CO2 hydrogenation were investigated. Cu-ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts operated under magnetic field gave higher CO2 conversions, compared to that of without magnetic field at all reaction temperatures. The highest CO2 conversions were obtained under the magnetic field condition at 20.8\u00a0mT in S-N direction which was 1.8\u20133.0 times higher than that of without magnetic field. Accordingly, the operating temperatures were significantly lower than those of without magnetic field at the same reaction rate. This outstanding performance could be attributed to the fact that the external magnetic field facilitated adsorption of CO2 reactant gas molecules over the surface of magnetized catalysts. Accordingly, the challenge in application of magnetic field in CO2 hydrogenation process help reduce CO2 emission into the atmosphere compared to the convention reactor, and therefore led to the carbon-neutral CO2 conversion process.",

     "abstract": "For the first time, toughening of epoxy resin by CO2 fixation reaction, through a new mechanism has been investigated. Completely CO2 fixed modified epoxy resin was synthesized at different amounts of carbonation content under ambient condition. Increasing cyclic carbonate content led to an increase in the toughness of modified epoxy resin which was evaluated using the critical stress intensity factor (KIC) calculated by the results obtained from the fracture toughness test. Fracture enhancement was achieved without scarifying the strength. Toughening was obtained through three mechanisms; (I) cross-link density reduction, (II) uncured carbonate groups and (III) formation of the urethane bonds as a result of reaction between cyclic carbonate and amine curing agent. The characteristic of \u03b2-relaxation peaks were studied by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) test and confirmed the toughening effect in the modified resins. The correlation between carbonation content and toughness was provided and an innovative strategy for toughening epoxy resin, called \u201cmolecular structure modification (MSM)\u201d was proposed.

The CO2 conversion of Ni/ZrO2 prepared by the urea combustion method achieves 60% while the conversion of Ni/ZrO2 using n-propanol as the combustion medium is less than 13% at 300\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.1\u00a0MPa and a WHSV of 48,000\u00a0mL\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7h\u22121.

The results illustrate that the combustion mediums significantly affect the catalytic pore structure, interaction between active metal and support, Ni dispersion, Ni particle size, the crystal structure of ZrO2 and CO2 adsorption capacity. In addition, the synergistic effect between nickel and mediums leads to a total phase transformation of zirconia from m-ZrO2 to t-ZrO2. The 15Ni/ZrO2 catalyst prepared by urea combustion method exhibits not only higher activity but also better stability due to its smaller Ni particle size and better resistance to carbon deposition than the one prepared by impregnation method.",

It was found that the deactivation of Ni catalyst by coke deposition could be reduced by the use of Ni catalysts with a unique composite structure of Ni on the tips of carbon nanotubes (Ni-CNTs). Accordingly, the effects of carbon structures of Ni-CNTs composites over mesocellular silica (MS) support on catalytic activity and stability in dry reforming reaction were examined in detail. Ni-CNTs(x)/MS catalysts were synthesized using the catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) technique at CCVD temperatures of 550, 650, and 750\u00a0\u00b0C to obtain different carbon structures, and were used in dry reforming reaction at temperatures of 650, 700, and 750\u00a0\u00b0C. The lowest and highest amounts of highly stable CNTs were observed with Ni-CNTs(650)/MS and Ni-CNTS(750)/MS composite catalysts, respectively. Turnover frequency (TOF) values of Ni-CNTs(750)/MS composite catalyst were approximately 2.62 and 3.63 times higher than that of the conventional Ni/MS catalyst at reaction temperatures of 650 and 750\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. In addition, Ni-CNTs(750)/MS catalyst not only gave a stable ratio of H2/CO products but also showed better trends for catalytic stability at all temperatures. During the reaction period, the carbon structure of less stable CNTs was partially refomed to highly stable CNTs, while that of highly stable CNTs (in the used Ni-CNTs(x)/MS catalyst) was not changed. Consequently, the presence of highly stable CNTs structure in the composite catalyst was found to enhance the activity and stability of dry reforming catalysts.",

In this article the interaction of CO2 with metal cluster-functionalized ILs is studied and provides key insights into the initial stages of CO2 activation and subsequent conversion. The interaction of CO2 with Au-Pd cluster-functionalized ILs is investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the DFT-B3LYP approach and the mixed basis sets of 6-31+G (d, p) and LANL2DZ. It is found that single Au or Pd atoms can interact with ILs and results in a significantly stronger interaction of Au with ILs than that of Pd. More broadly it is also found that Au-Pd cluster-functionalized ILs can significantly enhance the interaction of CO2 with ILs. Interestingly the interaction of CO2 with Au-Pd cluster-functionalized IL is found to be highly dependent on the size and composition of the cluster. Among the systems studied, Au1Pd2-functionalized IL yields the strongest interaction with CO2. Our results highlight a non-monotonous behavior for the composition- and size-dependent interaction of CO2 with Au-Pd cluster-functionalized ILs. It is proposed that these findings can provide a new roadmap for the design and development of metal cluster-functionalized ILs for CO2 conversion applications.",

     "abstract": "Utilization of supercritical CO2 as heat transmission fluid for geothermal development associated with geological storage can achieve the double wins of economic benefits and environmental protection. The advantages of supercritical CO2 in thermodynamics and injectivity have been recognized widely. The main concerns of this technology are focused on the water production process at the beginning of CO2 injection and the long-term complicated CO2-water-rock interactions in the geothermal reservoirs. These factors may significantly constrain the excellent heat mining performance of supercritical CO2, and lower the application potential of the technology. In this paper, the interactions between rocks and fluids in typical geothermal reservoirs and their effects on the heat mining performance of supercritical CO2 are studied based on an established reservoir simulation model. The development of different CO2 seepage zones in the reservoir, and the relevant rock-fluid interactions in these zones are investigated. The negative influence of water production and the change of reservoir properties induced by rock-fluid interactions on the CO2 heat mining performance are also assessed. The simulation results indicate that both of the salt precipitation induced by pore water vaporization, and the geochemical reactions between CO2 and rocks in the geothermal reservoir can damage the reservoir properties, especially serious salting out may occur around the production well and reduce the heat mining rate of CO2 significantly. Overall, the existing pore water can reduce more than 27% of the cumulative mined heat as well as nearly 45% of the heat mining rate after 40 years. Some measures, such as selecting reservoirs without water, and injecting fresh water, can be applied to mitigate the damage of pore water to CO2 heat mining performance.",

Based on the results, the feasibility of reducing CO2 emissions in this manner is demonstrated.The chemical composition of blast furnace slag as a raw material was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and the characterization of the crystal phase of the slag were calculated by the Rietveld method.Calcium extraction was conducted using ammonium salts (NH4NO3, NH4Cl, CH3COONH4 with (NH4)2SO4) as an extraction solvent under ambient conditions (30\u00a0\u00b0C, 1\u00a0bar).The calcium extraction efficiency was compared according to the solvent type and the optimal extraction conditions were examined according to the experimental variables of the solvent concentration, reaction temperature, reaction time and solid-to-liquid ratio. The calcium concentration in the extraction solution was measured by ICP-OES.The calcium extraction efficiency was proportional to the solvent concentration, the reaction temperature and the reaction time, whereas it was not proportional to the solid-to-liquid ratio. The calcium extraction efficiency of NH4NO3, NH4Cl and CH3COONH4 was approximately 52.0\u00a0wt.% on average and the Ca extraction efficiency of (NH4)2SO4 showed a low value (37.7\u00a0wt.%) compared to those of other solvents.A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was employed to assess the surface morphology and for an elemental analysis of the calcium carbonate synthesized from the carbonation test. The economic assessment to reduce CO2 was conducted based on this information along with the calcium extraction efficiency, and processing costs of the solvents, CO2, and other materials.",

The effect of metal loading of the powdered catalysts (working electrode) on the reduction capabilities of CO2 are studied, under ambient pressure and room temperature conditions. Electrochemical techniques such as linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry are employed to get the current response (current density) for CO2 reduction at different applied potentials. Current densities (C.D.) and the faradaic efficiencies (F.E.) of the products are the key performance indicators for any electrochemical process. The higher current densities and faradaic efficiencies for CO2 reduction are obtained with the optimum SnO2 content (20% by weight) on the high surface area MWCNT support. The 20% SnO2/MWCNT catalyst shows remarkable activity for CO2 conversion to formate with F.E. of c.a. 27.2% at a potential of \u22121.7V vs. SCE (Saturated Calomel Electrode). The higher activity is attributed to the uniform dispersion and more availability of active sites for CO2 reduction.",

In the homogeneous system, the Re(I) complex revealed the catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to CO in an acetonitrile solution at the onset potential of \u2212545\u00a0mV vs. NHE.

Adding sulfuric acid shifted the onset potential about 477\u00a0mV toward the more positive potential (at the onset potential of \u2212390\u00a0mV vs. NHE) and increased the cathodic current about 10.7 times in the heterogeneous reduction of CO2.",

Here, we investigate for the first time the potential use of waste materials from mafic rock quarries as a feedstock for the sequestration of CO2 by ex situ mineral carbonation. The experimental procedure was performed on a waste material from a dolerite quarry operating in the Troodos ophiolite (Cyprus). The ball milling process was applied to this quarry waste in order to create nanomaterials with enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity. Through CO2 chemisorption followed by temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) experiments, the optimum ball milling conditions were found (20\u00a0h of wet ball milling with 50\u00a0wt% ethanol as process control agent), leading to an enhancement of the CO2-storage capacity of the waste material by a factor of \u223c120. This enhancement of CO2 uptake is closely related to (i) the reduction of particle size to the nanoscale, (ii) the structural disordering of the constituent silicate minerals, and (iii) the presence of augite nanocrystals after ball milling. The experimental results suggest that waste materials from dolerite quarries may indeed be used as feedstock for the ex situ mineralization of CO2. They also strongly demonstrate that ball milling is a very promising technique for optimizing the ex situ carbonation of this waste material; thus the proposed methodology could be a fundamental part of a future carbon sequestration strategy.",

Two possible PtG technology vectors (business models) namely power-to-methane (PtM) and power-to-syngas (PtS) were investigated. Three cases for each business model were developed namely PtM-Scenarios 1\u20133 and PtS-Scenarios 1\u20133 corresponding to CO2 feed-in scales 10%, 20%, and 50% of the total CO2 emission throughput, respectively. The mass flows generated for each case were used to develop a cost model, which evaluated and compared the economic merits of the various scenarios of the PtM and PtS value propositions based on an economic indicator vis-\u00e0-vis levelized cost of syngas production (LCOS). This study indicated that at present market conditions, only PtS-Scenarios 1\u20132 demonstrated cost competitiveness against the reference syngas plant. In addition, we concluded that PtM is not a viable proposition for sustainable CO2 utilization in coal-to-liquid facilities at least for the near-to-medium term. However, a sensitivity analysis indicated that viability for PtM Scenarios 1\u20132 and all PtS business model scenarios is possible under future market conditions particularly when the CAPEX and OPEX relating to methanation and electrolyzers decrease, low electricity price, as well as when a CO2 emission credit/tax scheme (>30\u00a0$/ton) is instigated for the reference syngas plant.

This is because their hierarchical micro-mesoporous structure causes ions to diffuse into the carbon pores with low resistance.

To address these processes, the detailed catalytic mechanisms of three bimetallic clusters Pt3Ni1, Pt2Ni2, Pt1Ni3 to CO2 dissociation have been investigated, and their catalytic activities are compared with monometallic Pt4 and Ni4 clusters. The activation barrier values of CO2 dissociation with and without hydrogen sources on bimetallic PtxNi4\u2212x clusters are both between the values of monometallic Pt4 and Ni4 clusters. Evidently, CO2 dissociation with hydrogen sources is much easier to be carried out than that without hydrogen sources for all five clusters. Catalysis for CO2 dissociation needs to be combined with hydrogen sources. In addition, with the increasing number of Ni atoms in PtxNi4\u2212x clusters, the activation barriers present a moderate rise, indicating that Ni doping Pt cluster has a slight effect on the activity of Pt cluster for CO2 dissociation. As a result, the activity of bimetallic Pt-Ni for the reaction might be slightly lower than monometallic Pt, while, the cost of noble metal Pt catalysts will decrease with the addition of Ni.",

This step was followed by the spent catalyst regeneration in a CO2 rich atmosphere in the presence of O2 producing initially mainly CO and then CO2, thus significantly improved the CO/CO2 separation.

Phyllosilicates with high crystalline H2O provide the highest volumes of Mg. However, other features may diminish the importance of crystalline H2O. Structural complexity and the location of Mg in the lattice are important factors. Cyclosilicates are excluded from further studies based on unsuccessful results.

     "abstract": "Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been paid great attention in the field of the photocatalysis due to their interesting physicochemical properties such as positively charged hydroxide sheet, compositional flexibilities, and large surface area. We previously reported that the use of Ni\u2013Al LDH as a photocatalyst enabled us to achieve the maximum conversion of CO2 to CO with high selectivity among a series of synthesized LDHs, and chloride ions (Cl\u2212) in the reaction solution enhanced the amount of CO evolved. In this study, we attempted to prepare 16 different kinds of transition metal containing M2+\u2013M3+ LDHs (M2+\u00a0=\u00a0Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+; M3+\u00a0=\u00a0V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, and Fe3+) and applied them to the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 in an aqueous solution of NaCl. Ni\u2013V LDH, which has large specific surface area, exhibited the highest activity for the CO evolution among these LDHs; however the formation of H2 as a reduction product of protons (H+) was totally suppressed. It is estimated that a combination of V3+ and Cl\u2212 plays a significant role for the high photocatalytic activity and the high selectivity toward CO formation.",

     "abstract": "Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added fuels (e.g., CO and CH4) is a promising approach of storing solar energy and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions simultaneously. In this work, a novel material of crystallized titanium-embedded magnesium-aluminum layered double hydroxides (MgAlTi-LDHs) is developed and tested for CO2 photoreduction with water. Three different materials synthesis methods were explored: (1) coprecipitation, (2) coprecipitation\u00a0+\u00a0hydrothermal, and (3) coprecipitation\u00a0+\u00a0calcination\u00a0+\u00a0reconstruction. The coprecipitation method alone only produced amorphous TiOx species in the LDHs, while the latter two methods resulted in the formation of crystalline anatase TiO2 when appropriate treatment temperatures were applied but the specific surface area was decreased due to the thermal treatment. Compared with commercial TiO2-P25 nanoparticles, all MgAlTi-LDHs prepared in this work demonstrated two to four times higher catalytic activities in CO2 photoreduction to CO. Among the MgAlTi-LDHs, the CO2 photoreduction activity was affected by both the crystallinity of TiO2 and the specific surface area. Consequently, the material hydrothermally treated at 150\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C demonstrated the highest CO production due to a well-balanced TiO2 crystallinity and specific surface area. Findings in this work contribute to the development of efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction and advance the understanding of the catalyst property-activity relationships.",

In order to compare the effect of the crystallisation step on oxygen vacancies and conductivity, two different annealing conditions have been undertaken: under a high Ar flow (\u201cTiO2 Fibres-A\u201d sample) and under static Ar (\u201cTiO2 Fibres B\u201d sample). Moreover, these materials have been compared with individualised TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by a sol-gel procedure. CO and H2 are detected as major products with all photocatalysts, with lower amounts of CH4 and CH3OH. The TiO2 nanofibres exhibit better results than the sol-gel photocatalyst, behaviour that may be ascribed to an improved nanocrystals connection, which favours a fast charge transport along the grain boundaries, as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The highest CO2 reduction activity is achieved with the TiO2 Fibres B catalyst, which gives rise to ca. 4 and 2.5 times higher H2 and CO production, respectively, than the TiO2 Fibres-A one. This sample is composed of a mixture of anatase and rutile crystalline phases (80:20), leading to a decrease in the electron-hole recombination rate observed by photoluminescence (PL) measurements.",

CV tests indicate that the competing hydrogen evolution reaction remarkably slow down on porous Ag electrode and the onset potential of CO2 reduction occurs at 0.15\u00a0V less than that on the Ag foil electrode. Moreover, the high current density and CO faradaic efficiency of over 90% were stable over the course of several hours, whereas Ag foil electrode exhibited the drop of CO faradaic efficiency from 74.4% to 58.6% under identical conditions. We found that the enhanced activity and stability are the result of a large electrochemical surface area (approximately 120 times larger) which can provide more active sites. The noteworthy difference between the two electrodes suggests that the nanostructured surface of porous Ag foams is likely to not only favor the formation of CO2\u2212 intermediate but also suppress the competitive reaction of hydrogen evolution.",

Changing the carbon source of the systems from bicarbonate to CO2 positively influence the performance. Moreover, change in operation mode from continuous to batch resulted in improved acetate production rate, which also proved that the performance was reproducible and stable. Continuous CO2 supply maintained the pH near neutral which might explain the traces of ethanol produced in the system.

This combined CO2 capture and utilization eliminates the energy intensive CO2 desorption step associated with conventional CO2 capture systems as well as avoiding the problem of transporting concentrated CO2 to another site for storage or utilization.

Ruthenium remains the catalyst of choice due to its lower price and excellent low temperature performance.

When the added alumina sol is below 10\u00a0wt.%, the CO2 conversion is close to the equilibrium conversion of CO2 (26.5%) at 523\u00a0K and 5\u00a0MPa. Further increase of alumina sol content decreases the activity due to the decreased Cu surface area and weakened interaction among Cu and ZnO. When used in slurry bed, attrition resistance of catalysts plays an important role to determine the final catalytic performance. The catalyst without addition of alumina sol possesses low attrition resistance, which leads to catalyst loss and deactivation during reaction process. The introduction of suitable amount of alumina sol can enhance the attrition resistance of the catalysts markedly, and the catalytic activity can be still maintained at a high value.

The catalyst prepared by impregnation of the metals over the Al2O3 support was the most active and selective to dimethyl ether. This result can be explained by the better and lower temperature reducibility of CuO particles along with higher density of acid sites and strength of the alumina support.",

In addition, its economic and environmental feasibility was evaluated. In the studied case, a stainless steel plant generating AOD slag and a paper plant requiring calcium carbonate are situated at a relatively close distance. The studied concept uses ammonium chloride as solvent for extracting calcium from the slag. In a subsequent step, the extracted calcium reacts with CO2 in lime kiln flue gas and precipitates as calcium carbonate. First, an industrial application of the concept was designed including the following units: a reverse osmosis unit enabling better recovery of ammonium chloride, an evaporator for removing excess water from the process, and a scrubber for removing ammonia vapours from the flue gases. The process was modelled, after which the investment costs and operational costs were estimated, and its environmental footprint was assessed. The results indicate that the process could in its current stage of development be economic for producing calcium carbonate for replacing ground calcium carbonate used by paper mills. If the net annual profit would be used as payment on the investment, the payback period would be 2.2\u00a0years.

     "abstract": "CO2 diffusion in oil-saturated porous media with low permeability is of great importance for the project design, risk assessment, and performance forecast of carbon capture and storage (CCS) or enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This paper developed a method to determine CO2 diffusion in oil-saturated cores under low permeability reservoir conditions. Core, crude oil and experimental parameters were taken from the representative low permeability reservoir. In the solution of the mathematical model, oil saturation was introduced in to diffusion equation, an oil-phase swelling caused by gas dissolution was considered, but a water-phase swelling was not, which is in agreement with the actual diffusion situation. The error caused by the state equation of carbon dioxide was eliminated, improving the calculation accuracy of the diffusion coefficient. The effects of pressure (6.490\u201329.940\u00a0MPa), temperature (70\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C), oil saturation (0\u201363.58%) and permeability (8.62\u2013985.06\u00a0mD) on the diffusion coefficient of supercritical CO2 in low-permeability reservoirs were studied. The order of the diffusion coefficient is from 10\u221210 to 10\u22129\u00a0m2/s. The results show that with an increase in pressure and temperature, the CO2 diffusion coefficient in the porous media saturated with oil firstly increases significantly and then the rate of increase gradually slowed down. The CO2 diffusion coefficient increases greatly with the oil saturation in porous media. The CO2 diffusion coefficient first increases greatly with permeability, and when the permeability of the core is greater than approximately 100\u00a0mD, it remains almost stable. The experimental results can provide theoretical support for CO2 transport in porous media.",

The assembly will integrate the advantages of two processes, carbon dioxide sequestration by cells and carbon dioxide adsorption by chemical reagents, which resulted in 71\u00a0mmol CO2 fixation/g dry cell in 24\u00a0h. This article provides a basic study for CO2 sequestration and carbon resource utilization.",

Co-crystallization is an emerging and powerful technique to improve the physicochemical properties of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The solid-state and solution co-crystallization methods usually employed present several disadvantages. The one-step SAS method has a low environmental impact and overcomes some of the difficulties associated to conventional methods. The 2:1 co-crystals of the anti-inflammatory drug diflunisal (DIF) and nicotinamide (NIC) are prepared for the first time by SAS. Drug concentrations corresponding to the co-crystal stoichiometric composition are used. The influence of the SAS parameters temperature (35 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C), pressure (10.0 and 12.0\u00a0MPa), drug concentration (two levels) and solvent (acetone and ethanol) in the co-crystal formation is studied. A crystalline material in the form of needles of uniform width and more variable length is obtained. For comparison purposes, pure DIF and NIC are also processed by SAS. Co-crystals are characterized in terms of crystallinity, thermal behavior, coformer interactions and drug release; their dissolution rate improves with respect to that of pure DIF. SAS co-crystals exhibit the same crystal structure, melting point and FTIR spectrum as those previously obtained by liquid assisted ball mill grinding and solution crystallization.",

The result obtained revealed that the addition of Ce to RuMn/Al2O3 has a positive effect on the activity and catalyst stability compared to the Sr containing catalyst. The CO2 conversion over Ru/Mn/Ce-65/Al2O3 achieved 97.73% with 91.31% of methane formation at a reaction temperature of 200\u00a0\u00b0C while, 73.10% conversion over Ru/Mn/Sr-65/Al2O3 catalyst with 44.58% of methane yielded at reaction temperature of 210\u00a0\u00b0C. The characterization results obtained suggest that the CeO2, SrO2, RuO2, Mn2O3 and orthorhombic Al2O3 were the active species for both catalysts while, the presence of spinel compound, Sr4(Ru2O9) caused the reducibility and basicity of Ru/Mn/Sr-65/Al2O3 catalyst decreased hence reduced the catalytic activity eventually. The mechanistic study showed it was depended on the type of catalysts as the CO2 adsorbed on the Sr based catalyst tended to form monodentate carbonate at the initial state before forming the formate species when it was hydrogenated and finally releasing the methane. Meanwhile, the methane formation on Ce based catalyst involved the initially adsorption and dissociation of CO2 into C and O adsorbed species before reacting with the adsorbed H2 to form methane gas.",

In this study, graphene nanosheets were subjected to heat treatment in the temperature range of 200\u2013800\u00a0\u00b0C under flowing N2 to improve their textural characteristics (surface area, pores size, and total pore volume) for efficient removal of CO2 from flue gases. The resulting graphene materials showed highly ordered structure, large surface area (up to 484\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121) and interconnected hierarchical pore networks with narrow pore size distribution in the large-micropore/small-mesopore range. As a consequence, the heat-treated graphene samples demonstrated significantly greater CO2 uptake capabilities (up to 2.89\u00a0mmol\u00a0g\u22121) compared to pristine graphene (0.81\u00a0mmol\u00a0g\u22121) at 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 1\u00a0bar. More importantly, the materials displayed rapid adsorption kinetics with ultrahigh selectivity for CO2 over N2, as well as stable and readily reversible adsorption/desorption cycling behavior. The isosteric heat of adsorption had an unusual dependence on surface loading because of the presence of attractive intermolecular forces between the adsorbed quadrupolar CO2 molecules. These findings demonstrate for the first time that thermal treatment at high-temperatures can have a positive influence on the single component CO2 adsorption characteristics of graphene sheets and should be explored further as an effective strategy in the design and development of graphene-based porous solid adsorbents for CO2 abatement.",

N2 physisorption indicated that all preparation methods decreased the surface area and pore volume of the mesostructured silica nanoparticles (MSN) which may be attributed to the blockage of the pores by the deposition of NiO particles onto the MSN support. The XRD and H2-TPR analyses indicated that the in-situ method dispersed smaller Ni0 crystallites and exhibited a stronger metal-support interaction compared to the other methods. IR results indicated that the presence of an alkaline electrolyte during the introduction of Ni promoted sequential desilication-substitution of MSN, forming Si\u2013O\u2013Ni. CO2 adsorbed IR and ESR spectroscopies showed that NiM_IS possessed a higher basicity and more defect structures compared to NiM_IM and NiM_PM, owing to the abundant silanol groups and the formation of metal-deficient Ni2O3. At 800\u00a0\u00b0C, the CH4 and CO2 conversions occur in the order of NiM_IM (CH4\u00a0=\u00a045.6 %, CO2\u00a0=\u00a052.4%) <NiM_PM (CH4\u00a0=\u00a060.5 %, CO2\u00a0=\u00a083.9 %) <NiM_IS (CH4\u00a0=\u00a094.3 %, CO2\u00a0=\u00a091.7%). The amount of carbon deposited for NiM_IM, NiM_PM and NiM_IS was 2.97%, 2.35% and 0.84%, respectively. The promoting effect of the highest catalytic activity and lowest carbon deposition for NiM_IS was related to an intimate association between better dispersion and strongly interacted Ni, as well as high basicity and concentration of surface defects in the catalyst.",

This paper presents preliminary evaluation results on storage resource, technology readiness level and geographic distribution of onshore CGU in China; the results were obtained by performing a resource evaluation methodology, technology readiness level (TRL) method, and geographic information system tool. Results indicate a significant resource for onshore CGU technologies and good proximity in some parts of China. However, CO2 storage resources with high TRLs and low cost are located in the northeast, northwest, and southeast regions and not in the south and coastal areas of China, where most CO2 emission sources locate. Therefore, the timeframes and options for CGU deployment in different regions vary. This situation indicates that different regions have to perform CO2 mitigation by employing different CGU technologies at different timeframes.",

First, two sets of index systems of efficiency evaluation are established, and each of which contains three input indicators and three output indicators.

The results show that: (1) CO2 utilization technologies receive different DEA scores, while that with score 1 or more are dominated by chemical utilization; (2) CO2 geological utilization exhibits relatively higher sore under the direct-emission-reduction scenario than it does under comprehensive-emission-reduction scenario; (3) there are significant differences among the four types of biological utilization technologies; (4) DEA efficiency performance of CO2 utilization technologies gain improvement in 2030 than that in 2020, which in part provide evidence for the rationality of our study; and (5) DEA score rank has no correlation with emission reduction.

Here, we analyzed 188 articles on gaseous CO2 fertilization technology in China published from 1982 to 2010. We found that gaseous CO2 fertilizers enhanced the yield of representative fruit vegetable (i.e., cucumber, tomato, chili, zucchini, eggplant, and strawberry) by 33.31% over the past three decades. In addition, crop maturity also advanced (by an average of 6.87 days) and crop resistance to diseases and pests was enhanced. We observed a relatively good linear relationship between crop yield increases and increased CO2 fertilizer application for cucumber and chili once 240.0\u20133042.75\u00a0kg gaseous CO2 fertilizer was applied per hectare. For the other four crops, a positive correlation was observed. The mean increase in the yield of the six fruit vegetables supports the Technical Assessment Report of Carbon Dioxide Utilization in China, which adopted a 30% increase in yield by gaseous CO2 fertilizers to calculate the economic benefits of this technique. Finally, we suggest that methods of fertilization and business modes of gaseous CO2 fertilizer application that fit practical farming conditions in China should be proposed to serve as references for the development of gaseous CO2 fertilization for CCUS engineering.",

     "abstract": "Utilizing the greenhouse gas CO2 as a feedstock in chemical processing could offer alternative solutions to long-term storage. Large-scale production of light hydrocarbons such as methanol (MeOH) is one of the predominant and sensible schemes for such utilization. This proposal will not only recycle the CO2 gas within methanol synthesis process, but will also reduce the uptake of raw materials such as natural gas (NG) and reduce the greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions of a comparable stand-alone NG-based methanol synthesis plant.In this paper, a comprehensive model for CO2 integration in NG-based methanol synthesis plant has been developed. The reformer product (syngas) is mixed with the high-purity CO2 stream that comes out of power-plant carbon capture (PCC) process. It is found that this integration may reduce methane uptake by 25.6% and decrease the combined CO2 emissions for both power-plant and MeOH-plant by 21.9%. The energy intensity for this integration is 33.45\u00a0GJth/tonneMeOH and 0.64\u00a0GJel/tonneMeOH. The energy efficiency of this integration is 59% and the product to feed ratio is 2.27\u00a0tonneMeOH/tonne CH 4 higher than 1.69\u00a0tonneMeOH/tonne CH 4 calculated for a comparable standalone NG-based methanol synthesis plant with 68% efficiency.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, increasing attention from both industries and research has been focused on carbon capture and, subsequently, storage technologies. These technologies will contribute to companies\u2019 strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossils fuels. However, less effort has been spent on evaluating another interesting option after carbon capture: carbon utilisation or reuse. A feasibility study regarding an Italian industrial district is discussed: the district is characterised by the nearby locations of a CO2 producer (i.e. an natural gas combined cycle power plant) and a CO2 user (i.e. a sugar factory). The annual average CO2 emission by the power plant is about 1.7\u00a0million tonnes. Under current conditions the sugar factory \u2018produces\u2019 CO2 to use it in the sugar refining process; thus, the idea is to evaluate the feasibility of capturing CO2 emitted from the power plant and reusing it in the sugar factory process from both a technological and an economic point of view. The results indicated a cost saving of about 42% in the operational costs of the sugar factory due to the introduction of the carbon reuse technology.",

     "abstract": "The intermittent nature of wind and solar power requires long-term energy storage options such as power-to-gas. This technology utilizes (surplus) electricity from renewable power sources to produce hydrogen in an electrolyzer. The produced hydrogen can be either directly utilized as an energy carrier or combined with CO2 and further converted to methane. This article evaluates different CO2 sources concerning their potential utilization within the power-to-gas energy storage technology with regard to capture costs, specific energy requirement and CO2 penalties. The results of a case study for Austria indicate that there is enough CO2 available from point sources to store all of the electricity produced from fluctuating renewable power sources (wind power plants and photovoltaics) via power-to-gas. Due to low capture costs, low CO2 penalties, biogenic origins, and short distances to wind power plants, biogas upgrading facilities and a bioethanol plant were determined to be the CO2 sources best suited for utilization in novel power-to-gas plants. However, as the total amount of CO2 produced from these facilities is relatively low in Austria, other CO2 sources would also be required. With moderate capture costs and CO2 penalties, power plants and an existing refinery could also provide CO2 for power-to-gas. Although large amounts of CO2 are available from iron, steel, and cement production facilities, these sources are not recommended for CO2 utilization in power-to-gas, as the CO2 penalty is relatively high and the facilities are rarely located near wind power plants in Austria.",

The \u03b2-resorcylic acid (2,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid) has been isolated in the solid state and identified on the basis of its IR spectrum. The 13C NMR analysis has been applied to identify and quantify the carbonated species in solution upon CO2 uptake and after thermal resorcinol regeneration. The maximum yield of resorcinol conversion into \u03b2-resorcylic acid was 60% with 1.0\u00a0bar of CO2 and 120\u00a0min reaction time at 110\u00a0\u00b0C. A 34% yield of resorcinol conversion was also obtained with the resorcinol/K2CO3 solution in the absence of CO2. A relationship between the CO2 absorption capacity and the possible mechanism of CO2 capture has been proposed. The CO2 absorption efficiency from a simulated flue gases (15% CO2 in air) has been measured in continuous cycles of CO2 absorption\u2013desorption carried out in packed columns and with a glycerol\u2013water solution of resorcinol/KOH/KHCO3.

Batch experiment results showed that under H2 limitation conditions, larger amounts of H2 is supplied at the expenses of less CO2 production with yeast extract and protein powder from soybean than with glucose. Protein powder from soybean has been found to have similar stimulating effect on H2 formation to yeast extract. The biogenic conversion of CO2 to CH4 with protein powder from soybean was reflected by a net reduction of CO2 levels.

During stage-I, enrichment of homoacetogenic culture was carried out by supplementing H2 and CO2 in the reactors containing BESA treated and control cultures respectively. Optimization of pH was carried out in stage-II to enhance the carboxylic acids production at diverse pH range (acidic to alkaline viz., pH 5, 6.5, 8.5 and 10), where pH 10 was found to be optimum for maximum carboxylic acids (VFA: volatile fatty acids) generation in BESA treated (3500\u00a0mg/l) and control cultures (1200\u00a0mg/l) respectively followed by pH 8.5 utilizing bicarbonate. Interestingly, reduction in VFA concentration was observed after 24\u00a0h which can be attributed to its consumption by other groups of bacteria that co-exist along with the enriched culture. During stage-III, bioelectro-catalytic production of acetate was evaluated by considering the optimized pH 10 and under applied potential of -0.8\u00a0V vs Ag/AgCl (S) in two BES viz., BESB (BES with BESA treated consortia) and BESC (BES with parent consortia as control) using CO2 and bicarbonate respectively.

A study was performed to isolate an elevated CO2-tolerant microalgal consortium (CMAC) and then characterize growth-influencing environmental factors, CO2 sequestration capacity and the potential applications of CMAC for elevated CO2 sequestration. The CMAC was isolated from a wastewater treatment plant under a selection condition consisting of 50% CO2 in air (v/v). The CMAC species were identified as Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp., Sphaerocystis sp. and Spirulina sp. Multiple variables including 20% CO2, culture medium pH of 8\u20139, and an illumination intensity of 50\u201380\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0s\u22121 were found to be optimal for high density growth of CMAC for uptake of elevated CO2, although the CMAC were demonstrated to grow well in up to 50% CO2.

The lipid content of CMAC was high (350\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121), which gave a high biodiesel yielding capacity (420\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121). CMAC was also found to have high nutrient removal abilities (PO4-P, up to 59% and NH4-N, up to 39%). These characteristics all indicate that the isolated CMAC could be used as an efficient tool for biofuel generation from wastewater as well as bioremediation of pollutants. Thus by coupling the identified CO2 sequestration potential of the CMAC with the wastewater tolerance characteristics, there is novel potential to integrate wastewater treatment with CO2 sequestration and biomass utilization in order to mitigate the problems of increased GHG in response to global warming.",

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the solubility regularity of different hydrocarbons in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) in the first place. In this paper, our objective is to explore the solubility of n-alkanes (C6H14\u2013C18H38) in scCO2. To measure cloud point pressures, the experiment utilizes high-pressure view chamber, and results for accuracy and repeatability of the experimental method and instrument are evidently positive. Then, cloud point pressures for n-alkanes from 318\u00a0K to 343\u00a0K show a proximately linear and positive correlation with the temperature; they also increase with expanding chain length of n-alkanes. In addition, the result of x (molar fraction of n-alkane at cloud point pressure) indicates that x has a positive correlation with the pressure at identical temperature, and when pressure is constant, temperature increase will reduce x. Finally, relationship studies between density of CO2 and x reveal that, density of CO2 has a positive influence on the solubility of n-alkane, and the Chrastil model corrects ln\u00a0\u03c1 and ln\u00a0S data. The measured data align with the Chrastil model, with a maximum AARD value of 9.85%.",

Solubility is a key parameter in the phase equilibria calculations. According to the complexity of ILs structure, the phase behavior modeling for these systems is complicated.

X-ray crystallography data of 2 has demonstrated that the complex is a six-coordinated species. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) also showed the characteristic peak (m/z 401.6, negative ion mode) of 2 indicating the formation of the complex. 2 was successfully employed to convert a variety of olefins to cyclic carbonate in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2), an oxidant (e.g. tert-butylhydroperoxide, TBHP) and a co-catalyst (tetrabutylammonium bromide, TBAB) in a single-pot under mild reaction conditions. Upon reaction with an oxidant, 2 generated a non-heme high-valent manganese-oxo species (3), which was responsible for conversion of alkene to epoxide, and further cycloaddition of CO2 occurs in the presence of 2 and TBAB. The effect of reaction conditions (temperature and pressure), oxidants, and alkenes were systematically investigated for cyclic carbonate synthesis. High turnover numbers (50\u2013240) and yield were obtained when various alkenes were employed. Additionally, 3 was characterized using various spectroscopic and mass spectrometry techniques. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) of 3 indicated a peak at 839\u00a0cm\u22121 corresponding to manganese-oxo stretching. Isotope labeling studies of the oxo group of 3 revealed a peak shift to 804\u00a0cm\u22121 upon exchange of the 16O with 18O. 3 was also characterized by ESI-MS. 18O isotope studies were performed to understand the role of 3 in the catalytic cycle and to further establish the mechanism of the reaction.",

Life cycle assessment studies found in the literature have been reviewed for these purposes. In total, 27 studies have been found of which 11 focus on CCS and 16 on CCU. The CCS studies suggest that the global warming potential (GWP) from power plants can be reduced by 63\u201382%, with the greatest reductions achieved by oxy-fuel combustion in pulverised coal and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants and the lowest by post-combustion capture in combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants. However, other environmental impacts such as acidification and human toxicity are higher with than without CCS. For CCU, the GWP varies widely depending on the utilisation option. Mineral carbonation can reduce the GWP by 4\u201348% compared to no CCU. Utilising CO2 for production of chemicals, specifically, dimethylcarbonate (DMC) reduces the GWP by 4.3 times and ozone layer depletion by 13 times compared to the conventional DMC process. Enhanced oil recovery has the GWP 2.3 times lower compared to discharging CO2 to the atmosphere but acidification is three times higher. Capturing CO2 by microalgae to produce biodiesel has 2.5 times higher GWP than fossil diesel with other environmental impacts also significantly higher. On average, the GWP of CCS is significantly lower than of the CCU options. However, its other environmental impacts are higher compared to CCU except for DMC production which is the worst CCU option overall.",

     "abstract": "Alcoholysis of urea is an attractive methodology for the synthesis of organic acyclic carbonates. It has low environmental impact and represents an indirect way of using CO2. ZnO, known to have interesting performances, is reported in the literature to behave as a homogeneous catalyst in the form of Zn(NCO)2(NH3)2 in the methanolyis of urea. In this paper, theoretical and experimental studies are described aimed at shading light on the reaction mechanism of ethanol with urea under transition-metal (TM) catalysis. The reaction of ethanolysis of urea proceeds in two steps: i) formation of ethylcarbamate (EC) also in absence of catalysts; ii) co-ordination of EC, via the carbonylic group, to a TM centre and alcoholysis to afford diethylcarbonate (DEC). The adduct TM-EC has been isolated using several TMs (Zn, Sc, La) and characterized. It has been shown to react with ethanol to afford DEC. The energetics (free Gibbs energy) of the non-catalyzed and catalyzed ethanolysis of EC have been compared, highlighting the role of the TM as catalyst. The same reaction mechanism has been shown to hold for methanol, also if the energy of the TSs differs from EtOH. The reaction mechanism demonstrated in this paper for the ethanol(methanol)\u2013urea reaction is dissimilar from that reported in the literature for the methanol\u2013urea system, most probably due to both: i) higher level of DFT calculations used in this work that most carefully reveals the energetics of the TSs, and ii) use of Gibbs Free Energy instead of Enthalpy used by other authors.",

In the CO2 adsorption measurement, the CeO2-based adsorbents exhibited the largest CO2 adsorption capacity. CO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analysis revealed CO2 adsorbed on CeO2 desorbed mainly from 323\u00a0K to 473\u00a0K with its peak at 393\u00a0K, and relatively small amount of desorption continued to 723\u00a0K. To study CO2 adsorption and desorption mechanism, CO2 adsorbed on CeO2 and their temperature dependences were analyzed using in situ Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. FT-IR peaks from four CO2 adsorbed species (monodentate carbonate, bidentate carbonate, polydentate carbonate, and hydrogen carbonate species) were identified. Bidentate carbonate and hydrogen carbonate were main species, and the latter desorbed at around 473\u00a0K, which was the lowest temperature among species observed. CO2 desorption temperature from other species were approximately 573\u00a0K (bidentate carbonate and monodentate carbonate) and 723\u00a0K (polydentate), and it was consistent with CO2 TPD analysis. This indicates that the formation of hydrogen carbonate species on CeO2 is a key process to decrease desorption temperature for CO2 capture.",

     "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and absorption components consist of biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere and fossil fuels. CO2 flow rates are governed by large scale fluid dynamic, thermodynamic and radio-active transfer processes. This results in dynamic flow of CO2 over land and oceans affecting regional climates. Convective uptake of CO2 from Asia flows at high altitude to America and then returns sweeping the local emissions back to Asia. In this process the bulk clouds of CO2 are absorbed in cold Pacific Ocean surface waters near America, causing regional cooling effect. Dynamic thermohaline circulations take away the dissolved carbon to warmer Asian waters maintaining the global carbon balance. Monsoon winds sweep Himalayan valley smoke and CO2 to Arabian Sea causing regional warming. Atmospheric CO2 and dissolved water carbon concentrations cause regional warming and cooling effects. Global carbon circuit may cause regional warming and cooling, irrespective of local emissions. In this study, nature's response to higher concentration of CO2 and its direct removal from atmosphere or sequestration at source is presented. This paper describes global carbon balance, regional climate changes and carbon fix alternatives by developing industrial use of CO2.

However, pulverized coal combustion technology has several problems such as pulverized coal ignition delay, low flame temperature, and incomplete burning. Such issues have attracted the attention of the local and international academic communities. This study adopts a numerical simulation to analyze the combustion characteristics of conventional sized pulverized coal (70\u00a0\u03bcm) mixed with superfine pulverized coal (20\u00a0\u03bcm) in O2/CO2 atmosphere. The influences of co-combustion of two sizes pulverized coal on ignition, combustion flame structure, and NOx generation were analyzed. Results showed that the co-combustion of superfine and conventional-sized pulverized coal can enhance the ignition and combustion performance of pulverized coal in O2/CO2 atmosphere. The improved ratio of superfine pulverized coal promotes ignition process of pulverized coal and combustion intensity. Moreover, co-combustion can decrease NOx generation. As the ratio of superfine to conventional sized pulverized coal increases, NOx emission decreases. The reduction effect of NOx is most significant when the ratio of superfine to conventional sized pulverized coal increases from 30% to 50% and the co-combustion of superfine and conventional sized pulverized coal in O2/CO2 atmosphere can simultaneously improve combustion performance and reduce NOx discharge.",

These evaluations were carried out by Gibbs energy minimization, in conditions of constant pressure and temperature, and entropy maximization, at constant pressure and enthalpy, methods, to determine the equilibrium compositions and equilibrium temperatures, respectively. Both cases were treated as optimization problems (using non-linear programming formulation), satisfying the restrictions imposed by atom balance and non-negativity of number of moles. The GAMS\u00ae23.1 software and the CONOPT solver were used in the resolution of the proposed problems. All calculations performed presented a low computational time (less than 1\u00a0s). The calculated results were compared with previously published experimental and simulated data with a good agreement between them for all systems. The H2 and syngas production were favored at high temperature and low pressure conditions. The addition of H2O or O2 proved to be an effective way to reduce the coke formation in the systems. The CO2 reforming presented endothermic behavior, but the addition of O2 or air reduced this trend and in some conditions autothermal behavior was observed.",

However, oxidation potential of g-C3N4 is not enough for water oxidation. Therefore, we focused on hybridization of g-C3N4 and tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3) which has high oxidation potential for water oxidation. In this study, we examined CO2 reduction by composite photocatalyst of g-C3N4 and WO3, which was prepared by three methods (mixture using an agate mortar, impregnation and planetary mill). As a result, composite photocatalyst prepared with planetary mill showed the highest photocatalytic activity.Photodeposition of silver or gold nanoparticles only on g-C3N4 of the hybrid photocatalyst induced an increase in CH3OH because the loaded metal nanoparticles play an important role in multi-electron reduction of CO2. Photocatalytic activity of the Au-loaded hybrid photocatalyst composed of g-C3N4 and WO3 was 1.7-times higher than that of the hybrid photocatalyst without Au loading.In addition, we investigated photocatalytic reaction mechanism of composite photocatalyst by double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy.

     "abstract": "The catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPOM) involves the interaction among methane combustion (MC), steam reforming (SR), and dry reforming (DR), and CO2 generated from MC is utilized for syngas production in DR. To evaluate the potential of CO2 utilization in CPOM for syngas production, a numerical study is carried out where CO2 is added into the feed gas and CPOM is triggered in a rhodium-based catalyst bed. Two important parameters of CO2/O2 ratio and O2/CH4 ratio (or O/C ratio) in the feed gas are taken into account. The predictions suggest that CO2 addition plays no part in MC, but it retards SR and intensifies DR. The CO2 consumption increases with CO2/O2 ratio; however, the CO2 conversion goes down. As a whole, increasing CO2 addition enhances CO formation but reduces H2 formation. The maximum syngas production is exhibited at CO2/O2\u00a0=\u00a00.2 when the O/C ratio is 1. At a fixed CO2/O2 ratio, the maximum H2 yield and CO2 consumption are located at O/C\u00a0=\u00a01.8 and 1.0, respectively. However, the CO2 conversion monotonically decreases with increasing O/C ratio.

The investigated mixed metal oxide supports namely, CeO2\u2013ZrO2 (CZ) and TiO2\u2013ZrO2 (TZ) were synthesized by coprecipitation method, and the vanadium oxide was deposited on the supports by wet impregnation method. The synthesized samples were characterized by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The XRD analysis of CZ and CZ supported V2O5 samples revealed the formation of CexZr1\u2212xO2 solid solution and a highly dispersed vanadium oxide over the CZ support, respectively. On the other hand, different mixed oxide phases (ZrV2O7 and TiZrO4) were observed in the case of TZ supported vanadia catalyst. The TPR reduction temperature of supported samples is lower than the bulk V2O5. XPS results revealed that vanadium and cerium are in V5+ and Ce4+/Ce3+ oxidation states, respectively. Among the investigated catalysts, the CZ supported vanadium oxide catalyst exhibited a high activity and good time-on-stream stability. The redox property of the catalyst significantly influenced the catalytic activity in the ODH of n-butane with CO2.",

In particular, electrolytic conversion of CO2 may suit the short-term variability of the energy supply while avoiding issues associated with the large scale storage of hydrogen. Lanthanum cuprate perovskites were described a while ago as promising electrocatalysts for the production of valuable higher alcohols, ethylene and methane from CO2. However, confusion was apparent in the literature as to the nature of the compound that was used, and the data on applied potentials was scarce. In this paper, we report on the electroreduction of CO2 at a gas diffusion electrode loaded with a strontium-doped lanthanum cuprate perovskite in 0.5\u00a0M KOH. The compound was prepared following the procedure that was described in previous literature on CO2 electroreduction, and it was characterised as a mixture of bi-layered La1.8Sr0.2CuO4 with tetragonal (La,Sr)CuO2.6. We also extended the range of temperatures (2\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C) and pressures (1\u201343\u00a0barg). Methane and ethylene were major products of electroreduction, unlike in previous work where alcohols were dominant.

Interestingly, the presence of exposed defective regions in the acid treated nanostructures (e.g., uncapped nanotubes) gives rise to an improvement in the amount of CO2 adsorbed; the adsorption process being completely reversible. For N-doped nanostructures, the adsorption capacity is further enhanced when compared to the pure carbon nanotubes after the tubes were unzipped.

The effects of functional groups in ionic liquid, reaction temperature, initial CO2 pressure, and reaction time on the cycloaddition reaction were investigated.

Subsequently, a portion of the prepared Na2ZrO3 was mechanically mixed with 5\u00a0wt.% potassium carbonate (K2CO3). The Na2ZrO3 and K-Na2ZrO3 samples were characterized, and the CO2 capture processes were evaluated. The potassium addition did not modify the structural or microstructural characteristics of the Na2ZrO3. However, during CO2 chemisorption, the material presented some important variations that depended on the potassium addition. The maximum CO2 capture of the Na2ZrO3 sample was observed at T\u00a0\u2265\u00a0550\u00a0\u00b0C, while the CO2 capture of the K-Na2ZrO3 sample was significantly favored at 400\u00a0\u00b0C. According to DSC analysis, the CO2 capture increase observed at lower temperatures was due to the formation of a K\u2013Na carbonate eutectic phase. Additionally, for the samples demonstrating effective CO2 capture at relatively low temperatures, SEM microstructural analysis demonstrated the formation of a Na2CO3\u2013ZrO2 mesoporous external shell. Moreover, some kinetic parameters were determined. The isothermal data were fitted to a double exponential model related to the direct CO2 chemisorption (k1) and diffusion processes (k2). The K-Na2ZrO3 sample presented higher k1 and k2 values than Na2ZrO3 at all temperatures investigated, confirming that the potassium addition improved the CO2 capture process. Further, the potassium in Na2ZrO3 significantly enhanced the CO2 capture at approximately 400\u00a0\u00b0C, in comparison to the Na2ZrO3 sample. Finally, it was observed that potassium negatively compromised the chemisorption of CO2 after several cycles, due to potassium segregation and sublimation.",

An \u201cideal interface\u201d like that between water and air at ambient conditions does not form. Rather, a concentration gradient is observed. Nitrogen concentration increases toward the top of the separation vessel while carbon dioxide concentration decreases. In this way, the mole fraction of nitrogen at the top of the mixture is close to one and the concentration of carbon dioxide at the bottom of the mixture also approaches one. This concentration gradient is the basis of an effective separation. As the system pressure increases and/or the system temperature decreases, this density driven concentration gradient becomes less pronounced while consequently, the separation effectiveness is increased. The time to achieve maximum separation is quantified at different conditions, and found to decrease with increasing pressure. At the conditions studied, nitrogen is a supercritical fluid as a pure component while carbon dioxide is a liquid as a pure component, however the mixture is considered supercritical. The observation of a concentration gradient, and thus separation, is due to nonhomogeneities in the supercritical fluid mixture with density driven concentration gradients.

The liquid and gaseous wastes from oil refining were considered for the cultivation of Aphanothece microscopica N\u00e4geli in a bubble column photobioreactor. Growth kinetics, carbon dioxide removal and oxygen release rates, carbon balance, lipid production and biofuel quality were determined. The results showed the potential use of oil refinery wastes in microalgae-based systems under optimized culture conditions. The maximum specific growth rate was 1.4\u00a0day\u22121 and the maximum carbon dioxide elimination capacity was 22.9\u00a0mg/L\u00a0min. Each CO2 mass unit bioconverted resulted in approximately 0.75 O2 of mass units released. Carbon balance analyses indicated that a small fraction (3.64%) of the carbon dioxide is fixed into a biomass form. Volatile organic compounds (92.0%) were the main products of carbon dioxide transformation in the photobioreactor, in such conditions. For the production of biodiesel, it is possible to obtain 0.08\u00a0glipid/L\u00a0day with this process. The quality properties of the biodiesel were an ester content of 99.7%, a cetane number of 51.3, an iodine value of 79.9\u00a0gI2/100\u00a0g, a degree of insaturation of 65.3% and a cold filter plugging point of 24.9\u00a0\u00b0C. Based on these results, the process developed could be considered a promising emerging biorefinery platform of waste-material-utilization type.",

It is found that the reaction follows monometallic mechanism and is initiated by PO insertion into the ZnOR bond of the catalyst. The ring-opening of PO is inclined to occur via the methineoxygen bond (CCHO) cleavage. The rate-determining step is the second molecular PO insertion into Zn\u2013carbonate group. CO2 insertion proceeds easily and the reverse reaction of CO2 insertion is also easy to occur. It is likely that the most possible active species is the condensed species with repeated Zn\u2013O group, which shows high Gibbs free energy barrier to the formation of cyclic propylene carbonate. The consecutive PO insertion to give polyether and consecutive CO2 insertion to give dicarbonate linkages have been found to be disfavored.

     "abstract": "The interconnected challenges posed by the strategic and economic importance of petroleum and the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide are now widely recognized. A transition away from the fossil fuel dominated global economy toward a system with ever-lower carbon intensity but commensurate with energy demand is necessary. Addressing these challenges requires thinking differently, beginning with recognizing that from a technological point of view, liquid hydrocarbon fuels remain an ideal transportable energy storage medium, and that CO2 and H2O are simply the energy-depleted, oxidized form of hydrocarbons. Further, it is instructive to acknowledge that conventional fossil fuels are in fact \u201cstored sunlight\u201d. This perspective suggests searching for large-scale options that convert and store sunlight via reactions of carbon dioxide and water to more usable and transportable forms as nature did, but do so as efficiently, effectively, affordably, and sustainably as possible. Conversion of solar energy to reduce CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels is an attractive option, but it is not without significant resource, economic, and technical challenges. Herein we present a general examination of resource and economic considerations and conclude that solar-to-fuel efficiency is a key metric that drives not only the potential impact (scalability) of a technology for storing (contemporary) sunlight and sequestering carbon above ground as energy dense fuels, but also the economics. We show that given high enough efficiency (>10%) energy conversion routes, supplanting a large fraction of global petroleum-derived liquid fuels with synthetic solar-fuels is challenging but nonetheless possible; indeed it is quite plausible.",

DRM requires reaction temperatures above ~800\u00a0\u00b0C for complete equilibrium conversion to CO and H2, and is inevitably accompanied by carbon deposition. Here we examine lanthanum zirconate (La2Zr2O7) pyrochlores, with the larger trivalent cation La and a smaller tetravalent cation Zr occupying A and B sites, respectively. Three catalysts are tested: La2Zr2O7 [LZ] and two pyrochlores in which Zr in the B-site has been isomorphically partially substituted with (a) Ru (2.00\u00a0wt%) [LRuZ] and (b) Pt (3.78\u00a0wt%) [LPtZ]. The levels of substitution by weight correspond to identical atomic levels of substitution at the B-site. Here, activation energies are determined as a function of Ru or Pt substitution on the B-site. The results show that activation energies based on both CH4 and CO2 reaction rates are much lower for LRuZ than LPtZ. Conversion of CH4 ( X CH 4 ) and CO2 ( X CO 2 ) was greater for LRuZ compared to LPtZ at 525\u00a0\u00b0C, 575\u00a0\u00b0C, and 625\u00a0\u00b0C throughout an on-stream time of 600\u00a0min.
