The total pyrolytic liquid yield by thermal pyrolysis was found to be 39.39% for PW and 36.68% for SG, whereas catalytic pyrolysis at 20\u202fwt% loading increased the liquid yield by 2.34\u20134.79\u202fwt% for both the biomass. Thermal pyrolytic oil demonstrated increase in viscosity, density and decrease in acidity and heating value, whereas catalytic pyrolytic oil resulted in increased heating value, acidity, moisture, and decreased viscosity and density. FTIR analysis demonstrated the presence of aromatic compounds, phenols, alkanes, alcohols, acids, and aldehydes. GC-MS analysis confirmed that use of catalysts reduced the content of oxygenated and acidic compounds and increased that the amounts of alcohols and aldehydes in catalytic pyrolytic oil.",

Afterward, the catalytic activity of the synthesized catalyst was tested for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in an aqueous medium with remarkable results. The reduction reaction of 4-NP in water follows the pseudo-first order kinetics. B-ZVIN was also used as a catalyst for the synthesis of benzimidazoles in various solvents and solvent-free conditions.",

     "abstract": "Economically feasible and eco-friendly renewable energy fuels are obtained from the utilization of biomass of agricultural crops or microalgae or biological wastes which are good source of bioenergies. Now days, biofuels or biogases are main bio-energy source, provided alternative option to conventionally utilized (fossil fuel) energy which can fulfill increasing energy demand (in present and future) for worldwide people with minimization of green house gases in our environment. Bio-energy is normally produced from biological processes (fermentation or anaerobic digestion) via utilization of effective and suitable microbial system and sustainable raw substrates (agricultural crops biomass residue or biological wastes). Microbial fuel cells can be utilized for the complex organic wastes and renewable biomasses via exploitation of microbial catabolic biochemical reaction to produce the electric energy. Utilization of microbial fuel cells is found to be useful for sustainable bioenergy synthesis via completing the wastewater treatment processes with electric energy synthesis. Effective and suitable microorganism species system is now created by utilization of genetic materials modification or metabolic pathways engineering methods. Further, biofuel production improvement can be achieved successfully by utilization of optimal process design and development of synthetic microbial cells with planned of malfunctional of internally residing genes and/or other sources gene expression (microalgae species) or systems biotechnology (for global cellular information) and synthetic and systems biology (bacterial or yeast species).

Carbon nanopowder was homogeneously distributed into the graphite layers (carbon powder) by hand mixing using agate mortar. The mixture was then blended with trace amounts binder (paraffin) for construction of the electrode, i.e. carbon nanoparticle embedded carbon paste electrode (CNP-CPE). Scanning electron microscopic technique was used to study the surface morphology of electrode materials. Further, the electroactive surface area and the electron transfer properties of the fabricated electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetric method.

Among various photosynthetic microalgae able to produce hydrogen, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model organism widely used to study hydrogen production. Oxygen produced by photosynthesis activity of microalgae has an inhibitory effect on both expression and activity of hydrogenases which are responsible for hydrogen production. Chlamydomonas can reach anoxia and produce hydrogen at low light intensity. Here, the effect of bacteria co-cultivation on hydrogen produced by Chlamydomonas at low light intensity was studied. Results indicated that however co-culturing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Pseudomonas putida reduced the growth of Chlamydomonas, it enhanced hydrogen production up to 24%, 46% and 32%, respectively due to higher respiration rate in the bioreactors at low light intensity.

This work also emphasized on the need to make use of the emerging technologies of geomaterials and ecofriendly approaches to achieving a bio-based soil stabilization in this field. We are caught in crossfire when our structures fail due to the fact that soils are not studied to determine what needs to be done to improve in the microstructural, mechanical, hydrogeological, geophysical and strengthening properties of soils before erecting structures. There are lots of soil stabilization techniques and procedures available as outlined by the present work. Apart from the most commonly used techniques; mechanical (compaction, dewatering, mixing and so on) and chemical (lime, cement, bitumen, fly-ash and so on), there are other cheaper methods of stabilizing and improving the geophysical properties of soil like the use of geomaterial additives like bagasse ash (sugar cane foil ash), egg-shell ash, quarry dust, palm bunch ash, palm kernel ash, paper ash, crushed waste ceramics, crushed waste glasses, crushed waste plastics, snail shell ash, oyster shell powder, and so on. The ashes are amorphous materials from the direct combustion of solid waste materials while the powders are crushed solid waste too. It has been found that these biobased materials are also of highly pozzolanic properties which has made this a novel technology because of the green nature of the exercise. The CO2 emission with utilization of these organic and solid waste based geomaterials is zero, hence a total replacement of ordinary Portland cement in soil treatment with these alternative cementing additives is a breakthrough to our environment.",

The highlights and novelty of the synthesis are marked by the use of sodium borohydride to obtain small sized iron oxide nanoparticles starting from a transition metal complex and further stabilizing them with a polysaccharide that is apple pectin. The maghemite nanoparticles thus synthesized, are characterized by SEM, TEM and XRD whereas, pectin binding with nanoparticles is confirmed by FTIR. The size of nanoparticles obtained is between 2 and 6\u202fnm. The phase clarity of maghemites has been derived using Mossbauer spectra. Along with this, their antimicrobial behavior has also been studied using four different bacterial strains P. aerugenosa, S. aureus B. cereus and S. typhii.

First this paper tries to outline selected solid waste materials from which geomaterials utilized in the stabilization of soft soils are derived by direct combustion or crushing. Secondly, the utilization of these derivatives, which serve as alternative cement in stabilization of soft soils presents construction methods devoid of CO2 emission because these materials are eco-friendly.

PEG as a conventional binder is used for the preparation of alumina-based materials. The main aim of this work was to investigate the effect of different contents of PEG and sintering conditions on the critical quality of produced alumina including microstructure, porosity, compressibility, and mechanical properties. Also, the influence of compression pressure (from 3500 to 5000\u202fbar) on the green density of the produced alumina pellets was evaluated while the binder contents are varied from 1 to 5\u202fwt%. The analysis results showed that the addition of PEG to the alumina powder enhances the green density of the produced disks until a maximum value. Over the maximum point, the density did not further change with increasing PEG content. This high green density leads to a high sintered density of the alumina disks. The results show that the formulation containing more than 4\u202fwt% of PEG causes both lower sintered and green density. The fabricated alumina pellets were then compared to those without additives in terms of mechanical strength, and it was indicated that the density of fabricated pellets enhanced by rising the compaction pressure greater than 3500\u202fbar.",

We deposited lanthanum-doped lead zirconate titanate (PLZT) films on aluminum-metallized polyimide films at room temperature by an aerosol deposition (AD) process and examined the electrical and dielectric properties of the PLZT films over a wide temperature range between \u221255 and 175\u202f\u00b0C. The PLZT film capacitors fabricated by high deposition rate AD process not only satisfy X8R temperature rating but also exhibit superior volumetric and gravimetric specific capacitance. At room temperature, we measured a dielectric constant of \u224885, dielectric loss of \u22480.012, energy density of \u224813.2\u202fJ/cm3 with an applied voltage of \u22481000\u202fV.

These results revealed that the PLZT-based ceramic film capacitors meet the requirements for advanced high-temperature power inverters.

Coating of carbon nanomaterials directly onto functional fiber is a facile strategy to prepare wire-shaped electrodes. However, it is still a critical challenge to maximize the adhesion of the nanomaterials onto aimed substrate fiber, while still maintaining the high specific area of the nanomaterials. Herein, both carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene were coated onto the surface of nickel wires via capillary effect driven process. It was discovered that the one dimensional morphology of the CNTs not only benefited the adhesion of CNTs on the relatively smooth surface of the nickel metal wire, but also strengthened the infiltration of the electrolyte among the CNTs. On the contrast, the restacking of graphene oxide (GO) sheets retarded the infiltration of the electrolyte, resulting in inferior capacitive performance. The prepared Ni-CNT electrodes showed excellent electrochemical double layer capacitive performance along with the mechanical robustness and high flexibility. The constructed all-solid flexible wire-shaped supercapacitors maintained a high specific capacitance of approximately 30\u202fF/g after 3000 cycles when bent by 45\u202fdegree.",

The optimized values of temperature, oil to alcohol molar ratio and catalyst concentration were found to be 65\u202f\u00b0C, 1:6\u202fmolar ratio and 1.2\u202fwt% of oil respectively. Ultrasonic cavitation method was found to be more rapid, energy efficient and time saving over conventional stirring method. Thermodynamic parameters such as standard heat of reaction, standard Gibbs free energy change and equilibrium constant at optimized operating conditions were reported. A kinetic study of transesterification of Thumba oil for conventional heating method is presented in this paper. The observed rate constant for the overall reaction was of two orders.

     "abstract": "Microbial desalination cell (MDC) is a novel bioelectrochemical system, capable of removing salts and organic matter from wastewater simultaneously. For improving the performance, a carbon supported silver-tin dioxide (Ag-SnO2) composite was synthesized and used as cathode catalyst in a five-chambered MDC (MDC-1). The results were compared with MDC-2 having no catalyst on the cathode. Saline water with a NaCl concentration of 20\u202fg/L was used to evaluate the desalination efficiency of both the MDCs. The electrochemical studies such as cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry of the cathode of MDC-1 revealed the superior reduction kinetics. Increased desalination efficiency was observed in MDC-1 (72.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.0%) due to presence of Ag-SnO2 catalyst as compared to MDC-2 (57.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.6%). Maximum power density of 1.47\u202fW/m3, demonstrated by MDC-1, was noted to be 1.67 times higher than that of MDC-2 (0.88\u202fW/m3). In addition, the coulombic efficiency of MDC-1 was observed to be 14.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2%, which was significantly higher than that observed in MDC-2 (9.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3%). Performance results confirmed the excellent catalytic activity of Ag-SnO2 composite catalyst to be used on the cathode of MDCs, to take forward this cutting-edge technology for field scale application.",

In the present study, a composite membrane prepared using phosphonate ionic liquid immobilised SBA-15 as filler and SPEEK as matrix has been reported. The imidazolium ionic liquid namely 1-Methyl-3-(3- Trimethoxysilylpropyl) imidazolium chloride was grafted on SBA-15 followed by reacting with monosodium phosphate to afford phosphate ion (H2PO4\u2212) containing SBA-15 (PIL-SBA-15). The structure of PIL-SBA-15 was confirmed by solid state CP/MAS 13C and 31P NMR, FTIR, low angle XRD, BET and TEM analyses. SPEEK composite membranes with different concentrations (2, 4, 6 and 8 wt%) of PIL-SBA-15 was prepared by simple solution casting method. The change in morphology of the composite membranes were studied using SEM and XRD techniques. The ion exchange capacity, proton conductivity at high temperatures and water uptake of the composite membranes increased in the presence of PIL-SBA-15. The membrane with 6% fillers showed the maximum electrochemical performance with superior mechanical strength. Upon testing this composite membrane as electrolyte in fuel cell using platinum as both anode and cathode electrodes under un-humidified condition, a maximum power density of 183\u202fmW/cm2 was achieved at 140\u202f\u00b0C. The existence of additional ion exchange groups (H2PO4\u2212) lead to the improved performance at high temperature.",

The effect of the shape of graphite on the morphological, composition, structural properties of the composite coatings, thermal stability and anti-oxidative behaviour at high temperatures were studied. The major composition of the composite coating is silicon carbide (Si5C3, CSi), nickel silicon (Ni0.92Si0.08) and graphite (C). Porous and fine grain structure is formed with cracks. Uniform distributions of SiC nanoparticle were observed. Circular graphite possessed higher adhesion and thickness of the coatings in comparison with rod and square shaped graphite substrate. Thermal analysis of the coated samples indicates the weight loss of SiC coated graphite as 16.5% (rod), 30% (square), 2.5% (Circular). Uncoated graphite had a weight loss of 32.5%. The thermal oxidation of the coated sample in air is least for circular geometry in comparison to rod and square. Thus SiC coated circular graphite can be utilized for high temperature applications such as solar thermal absorbers.",

     "abstract": "World\u2019s energy needs are majorly dependent on the fossil fuels, including petrochemical sources and coal. The alternate of these fuels include hydro and nuclear powers. However, all these resources are finite and current rate of consumption indicates the shortening of the fuels and energy in the near future. Diesel plays a remarkable role in the economy of the developing and developed countries in industry and other sectors being a basic fuel used in transportation. The increasing demand of alternate energy based on renewable resources and pollution-free production is a major concern these days for environmentalists. Biodiesel, in this regard is set to be the best entrant to acquire the desired alternative of conventional fuels. The production of biodiesel is carried out through transesterification reaction using edible oil feedstocks, which is not feasible for developing countries. Hence, utilization of low-grade feedstocks for biodiesel production is the new clinch for the developing countries. In general, the transesterification reaction is mediated by catalysts and hence, design of an effective catalyst is the key to produce efficient and commercially viable biodiesel. In this direction, it is necessary to understand the material chemistry of catalysts and mechanism of the catalytic transesterification reaction. This review enlightens the basics of transesterification, role of various process parameters and factors affecting biodiesel production from different feedstocks. In this review we have discussed various nanoporous heterogeneous catalysts investigated for biodiesel production and mainly focused on the mechanism involved in transesterification using heterogeneous catalysts.",

Doxorubicin (Dox), as model anticancer drug, was loaded on the synthesized OCNPs via pH-responsive linkages between functional groups of Dox and OCNPs. Its release behaviour was studied in medium of different pH values. Dox release was maximum at pH 5.0 and pH 6.8 i.e., endosomal and extracellular pH, respectively in tumor tissue, and minimum at physiological pH 7.4 of normal tissues. Various mathematical models were applied to elucidate the release mechanism of the Dox from the loaded OCNPs. Dox release followed non-Fickian diffusion mechanism. The results suggest that these pH-responsive OCNPs are effective and promising Dox-delivery carriers for cancer treatment and capable of reducing side-effects of this anticancer drug to the normal cells.",

     "abstract": "Pairing tungsten oxide (WO3) and bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) to form heterojunction photoanode is a very promising strategy to attain the enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting efficiency. In fact, the PEC efficiency of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode performs significantly better than either of the individual materials due to their well-matched band edge positions, efficient charge separation, and light harvesting abilities. In WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction, BiVO4 serves as an excellent visible-light absorber (\u223c30% sunlight) and WO3 functions as an active electron conductor. Therefore, the optimization of the ratio and structure of WO3 and BiVO4 becomes very crucial to produce maximum PEC efficiency. In this review, the significant efforts and remarkable milestones achieved using WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode in PEC water splitting is summarized. The various factors that influence the PEC activity of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction include the nanostructure morphology, charge carrier\u2019s dynamics, layers of WO3 and BiVO4, use of catalysts and doping, etc. With WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode, outstanding PEC performance equal to the theoretical efficiency values (WO3 and BiVO4) has been achieved.

     "abstract": "This paper describes a preliminary study on the practical feasibility of covalent attachment or grafting of hydrophilic biological monosaccharide namely, sialic acid (SA) onto the backbone of hydrophobic biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) by electron beam (e-beam) irradiation induced free radical polymerization. In the first part of the study, generation of reactive sites/free radicals on PCL backbone, shelf life of these free radicals and a relationship between free radical concentration vs irradiation dose were investigated by electron spin resonance (ESR) study. Later, the grafting of monomer was carried out under different reaction conditions viz., dry method (method 1), wet state co-irradiation (method 2) and water based (method 3) and the same was qualitatively confirmed through Fourier Transfer Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) as well as elemental analysis. ESR results showed that the concentration of free radicals increased with an increase in radiation dose. Concentration of these free radicals is very high in initial 1\u202fh with progressive decay and approaches zero concentration in 24\u202fh. The extent of grafting was changed by changing the reaction conditions. The most satisfactory grafting of SA onto PCL was possible under solution state irradiation condition (i.e., in method 2). In FTIR studies, CC and CO stretching were seen at 1176\u202fcm\u22121 and 1294\u202fcm\u22121, representing amorphous and crystalline regions respectively. This shift in the crystalline to amorphous domain represents the occurrence of grafting of SA onto PCL and formation of grafted (SA-g-PCL) chains. These changes were observed only in method 2 carried out at lower doses (20, 40\u202fkGy). Further, the presence of element nitrogen (0.178%) in samples obtained from method 2, presented a strong evidence of attachment of SA onto the PCL backbone. Our findings provide new information on the possible grafting of PCL, which could be exploited in future as promising polymeric material to make biocompatible and hydrophilic drug delivery carrier.",
