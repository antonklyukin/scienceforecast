     "abstract": "The AEI cavity of SAPO-18 catalyst was modified with zinc cations with the conventional ion exchange procedure. The cavity modification effectively tunes the product selectivity, and shifts the products from mainly propylene to comparable production of ethylene and propylene in methanol to olefin (MTO) reaction. The incorporation of zinc ions and the generation of bicyclic aromatic species in the AEI cavity of SAPO-18 catalysts introduce additional diffusion hindrance that exert greater influence on the relatively bulky products (e.g. propylene and higher olefins), which increase the selectivity to small-sized products (e.g. ethylene). It appears that the incorporated zinc cations facilitate the generation of lower methylbenzenes which promote the generation of ethylene. The cavity modification via incorporating zinc ions effectively tunes the product selectivity over SAPO molecular sieves with relatively larger cavity, which provides a novel strategy to develop the potential alternative to SAPO-34 catalysts for industrial MTO reaction.",

     "abstract": "Photocatalytic Z-scheme water splitting is considered as a promising approach to produce solar hydrogen. However, the forward hydrogen production reaction is often impeded by backward reactions. In the present study, in a photosystem II-integrated hybrid Z-scheme water splitting system, the backward hydrogen oxidation reaction was significantly suppressed by loading a PtCrOx cocatalyst on a ZrO2/TaON photocatalyst. Due to the weak chemisorption and activation of molecular hydrogen on PtCrOx, where Pt is stabilized in the oxidized forms, PtII and PtIV, hydrogen oxidation is inhibited. However, it is remarkably well-catalyzed by the metallic Pt cocatalyst, thereby rapidly consuming the produced hydrogen. This work describes an approach to inhibit the backward reaction in the photosystem II-integrated hybrid Z-scheme water splitting system using Fe(CN)63\u2212/Fe(CN)64\u2212 redox couple as an electron shuttle.",

     "abstract": "CO methanation on Ni/CeO2 has recently received increasing attention. However, the low-temperature activity and carbon resistance of Ni/CeO2 still need to be improved. In this study, plasma decomposition of nickel nitrate was performed at ca. 150\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure. This was followed by hydrogen reduction at 500 \u00b0C in the absence of plasma, and a highly dispersed Ni/CeO2 catalyst was obtained with improved CO adsorption and enhanced metal-support interaction. The plasma-decomposed catalyst showed significantly improved low-temperature activity with high methane selectivity (up to 100%) and enhanced carbon resistance for CO methanation. For example, at 250\u00b0C, the plasma-decomposed catalyst showed a CO conversion of 96.8% with high methane selectivity (almost 100%), whereas the CO conversion was only 14.7% for a thermally decomposed catalyst.",

     "abstract": "To accelerate the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, ultrafine Pt nanoparticles modified with trace amounts of cobalt were fabricated and decorated on carbon black through a strategy involving modified glycol reduction and chemical etching. The obtained Pt36Co/C catalyst exhibits a much larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and an improved ORR electrocatalytic activity compared to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, an electrode prepared with Pt36Co/C was further evaluated under H2-air single cell test conditions, and exhibited a maximum specific power density of 10.27 W mgPt\u22121, which is 1.61 times higher than that of a conventional Pt/C electrode and also competitive with most state-of-the-art Pt-based architectures. In addition, the changes in ECSA, power density, and reacting resistance during the accelerated degradation process further demonstrate the enhanced durability of the Pt36Co/C electrode. The superior performance observed in this work can be attributed to the synergy between the ultrasmall size and homogeneous distribution of catalyst nanoparticles, bimetallic ligand and electronic effects, and the dissolution of unstable Co with the rearrangement of surface structure brought about by acid etching. Furthermore, the accessible raw materials and simplified operating procedures involved in the fabrication process would result in great cost-effectiveness for practical applications of PEMFCs.",

     "abstract": "Ethanol conversion to high-value-added products has attracted considerable attention in both academic research and industrial fields. In this study, we synthesized a series of tunable acid\u2013base bifunctional Zn-Zr-Al metal oxides (represented as Zn2ZrxAl-MMO) in light of the structural topotactic transformation of Zn2ZrxAl-hydrotalcite precursors (Zn2ZrxAl-LDH). The resulting Zn2ZrxAl-MMO catalysts were employed in the conversion of ethanol to diethyl carbonate. The Zr4+ ion content of the LDH precursor plays a key role in modulating the acid-base properties and determining catalytic performance: the Zn2Zr0.1Al-MMO sample exhibits the optimal catalytic behavior with a diethyl carbonate (DEC) yield of 42.1%, which is the highest reported for metal oxide catalysts. Structure-property correlation investigations revealed that the synergic catalysis between medium-strong basic sites and weak acid sites plays a predominant role in the catalytic behavior. Furthermore, in situ Fourier transform infrared measurements showed that the weak acidic site promotes activation adsorption of the reactant (urea) and the intermediate product (ethyl carbamate), while the medium-strong basic site accelerates ethanol activation. Moreover, the Zn2Zr0.1Al-MMO catalyst has the advantages of cost effectiveness, good stability, and reusability. Therefore, the acid-base bifunctional catalysts developed in this work can be employed as promising candidates in acid-base catalytic reactions such as ethanol conversion.",

     "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a very useful chemical reagent, but the current industrial methods for its production suffer from serious energy consumption problems. Using high-activity and high-selectivity catalysts to electrocatalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through a two-electron (2e\u2212) pathway is a very promising route to produce H2O2. In this work, we obtained partially oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with controlled structure and composition by oxidation with concentrated sulfate and potassium permanganate at 40\u00b0C for 1 h (O-CNTs-40-1). The outer layers of O-CNTs-40-1 are damaged with defects and oxygen-containing functional groups, while the inner layers are maintained intact. The optimized structure and composition of the partially oxidized MWCNTs ensure that O-CNTs-40-1 possesses both a sufficient number of catalytic sites and good conductivity. The results of rotating ring disk electrode measurements reveal that, among all oxidized MWCNTs, O-CNTs-40-1 shows the greatest improvement in hydrogen peroxide selectivity (from \u223c 30% to \u223c 50%) and electron transfer number (from \u223c 3.4 to \u223c 3.0) compared to those of the raw MWCNTs. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements indicate that both the charge-transfer and intrinsic resistances of O-CNTs-40-1 are lower than those of the raw MWCNTs and of the other oxidized MWCNTs. Finally, direct tests of the H2O2 production confirm the greatly improved catalytic activity of O-CNTs-40-1 relative to that of the raw MWCNTs.",

     "abstract": "Glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel production and is an important readily available platform chemical. Valorization of glycerol into value-added chemicals has gained immense attention. Herein, we carried out the conversion of glycerol to formic acid and glycolic acid using H2O2 as an oxidant and metal (III) triflate-based catalytic systems. Aluminum(III) triflate was found to be the most efficient catalyst for the selective oxidation of glycerol to formic acid. A correlation between the catalytic activity of the metal cations and their hydrolysis constants (Kh) and water exchange rate constants was observed. At 70 \u00b0C, a formic acid yield of up to 72% could be attained within 12 h. The catalyst could be recycled at least five times with a high conversion rate, and hence can also be used for the selective oxidation of other biomass platform molecules. Reaction kinetics and 1H NMR studies showed that the oxidation of glycerol (to formic acid) involved glycerol hydrolysis pathways with glyceric acid and glycolic acid as the main intermediate products. Both the [Al(OH)x]n+ Lewis acid species and CF3SO3H Br\u00f8nsted acid, which were generated by the in-situ hydrolysis of Al(OTf)3, were responsible for glycerol conversion. The easy availability, high efficiency, and good recyclability of Al(OTf)3 render it suitable for the selective oxidation of glycerol to high value-added products.",

The effect of the ZrOCl2\u00b78H2O/BTC molar ratio on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of MOF-808-X was investigated. Results showed that a proper ZrOCl2\u00b78H2O/BTC molar ratio during MOF-808-X synthesis was fairly important to reduce the redundant BTC or zirconium clusters trapped in the micropores of MOF-808-X. MOF-808-4, with almost no redundant BTC or zirconium clusters trapped in the micropores, exhibited the largest surface area, micropore size, and the number of acidic-basic sites, and consequently showed the best activity among all MOF-808-X, with the highest DMC yield of 21.5% under the optimal reaction conditions. Moreover, benefiting from the larger micropore size, MOF-808-4 outperformed our previously reported UiO-66-24 (12-connected), which had even more acidic-basic sites and larger surface area than MOF-808-4, mainly because the larger micropore size of MOF-808-4 provided higher accessibility for the reactant to the active sites located in the micropores. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism over MOF-808-4 was proposed based on the in situ FT-IR results. The effects of different reaction parameters on DMC formation and the reusability of MOF-808-X were also studied.",

The Ni-Re/SiO2 catalyst with the lowest Ni particle size (4.5 nm) exhibited the highest yield (66.4%) of the desired amines (ethylenediamine (EDA) and piperazine (PIP)). The results of the analysis show that the turnover frequency of MEA increased slightly (from 193 to 253 h\u22121) as the Ni particle sizes of the Ni-Re/SiO2 catalysts increased from 4.5 to 18.0 nm. Moreover, the product distribution could be adjusted by varying the Ni particle size. The ratio of primary to secondary amines increased from 1.0 to 2.0 upon increasing the Ni particle size from 4.5 to 18.0 nm. Further analyses reveal that the Ni particle size influenced the electronic properties of surface Ni, which in turn affected the adsorption of MEA and the reaction pathway of MEA amination. Compared to those of small Ni particles, large particles possessed a higher proportion of high-coordinated terrace Ni sites and a higher surface electron density, which favored the amination of MEA and NH3 to form EDA.",

X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements indicated that the Bi2S3 content had a significant influence on the growth of (040) and (121) facets as well as on the morphology of the Bi2S3/BiVO4 samples.

The results of transient photocurrent tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements confirmed that a more effective charge separation and a faster interfacial charge transfer occurred in Bi2S3/BiVO4 than BiVO4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Bi2S3/BiVO4 samples could be attributed to the improved absorption capability in the visible light region and the enhanced electron-hole pair separation efficiency due to the formation of the Bi2S3/BiVO4 heterostructure. In addition, the Bi2S3/BiVO4 samples showed relative stability and reusability.

After the introduction of contaminants into Cu-SAPO-18, the quantity of acidic sites and Cu2+ species in catalyst decreases owing to the replacement of H+ and Cu2+ by K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Furthermore, the loss of isolated Cu2+ induces the generation of CuO and CuAl2O4-like phases, which causes further loss in the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of the catalyst. Consequently, the deNOx performance of the contaminated Cu-SAPO-18 catalysts drops. Such decline in NH3-SCR performance becomes more pronounced by increasing the contaminant contents from 0.5 to 1.0 mmol/gcatal. In addition, the deactivation influence of the contaminants on Cu-SAPO-18 is presented in the order of K> Na > Ca > Mg, which is consistent with the order of reduction of acidic sites. To a certain degree, the effect of the acidic sites on the deactivation of Cu-SAPO-18 might be more significant than that of isolated Cu2+ and the catalyst framework. Moreover, kinetic analysis of NH3-SCR was conducted, and the results indicate that there is no influence of contaminants on the NH3-SCR mechanism.",

A recent breakthrough has shown that gold nanoparticles (NPs) can retain their catalytically active size over a MgGa2O4 spinel support upon sintering at high temperatures. Herein, we report the catalytic activity of anti-sintering Au MgGa2O4 for use in water gas shift reaction (WGSR) and catalytic combustion reactions, and the promoting effect of ceria. Upon adding ceria to 800\u00b0C-aged Au MgGa2O4, the CO conversion in the WGSR was increased from \u223c1.5% to \u223c34.0% at 450\u00b0C, and the \u201clight-off\u201d temperatures (T50) for methane combustion and CO oxidation were decreased by \u223c80 and \u223c100\u00b0C, respectively. Characterizations using XRD, HAADF-STEM, EDS mapping, H2-TPR, XPS, and DRIFTs confirmed the proximate contact of Au with ceria and their significant synergistic effect, which thereby combined the benefits of ceria toward the dissociation of H2O or O2 and the Au NPs toward activating CO or CH4.

     "abstract": "Ag3PO4 is widely used in the field of photocatalysis because of its unique activity. However, photocorrosion limits its practical application. Therefore, it is very urgent to find a solution to improve the light corrosion resistance of Ag3PO4. Herein, the Z-scheme WO3(H2O)0.333/Ag3PO4 composites are successfully prepared through microwave hydrothermal and simple stirring. The WO3(H2O)0.333/Ag3PO4 composites are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. In the degradation of organic pollutants, WO3(H2O)0.333/Ag3PO4 composites exhibit excellent performance under visible light. This is mainly attributed to the synergy of WO3(H2O)0.333 and Ag3PO4. Especially, the photocatalytic activity of 15%WO3(H2O)0.333/Ag3PO4 is the highest, and the methylene blue can be completely degraded in 4 min. In addition, the stability of the composites is also greatly enhanced. After five cycles of testing, the photocatalytic activity of 15%WO3(H2O)0.333/Ag3PO4 is not obviously decreased. However, the degradation efficiency of Ag3PO4 was only 20.2%. This indicates that adding WO3(H2O)0.333 can significantly improve the photoetching resistance of Ag3PO4. Finally, Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism is investigated.",

The self-assembly of ZnIn2S4 microspheres on the surface of NiS/CQDs was realized under microwave conditions to obtain a ternary NiS/CQDs/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposite. The as-obtained NiS/CQDs/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposite was fully characterized, and its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation was investigated. The ternary NiS/CQDs/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposite showed superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution than ternary CQDs/NiS/ZnIn2S4, which was obtained by deposition of NiS in the preformed CQDs/ZnIn2S4. The superior photocatalytic performance of ternary NiS/CQDs/ZnIn2S4 is ascribed to the introduction of CQDs, which act as a bridge to promote the vectorial transfer of photo-generated electrons from ZnIn2S4 to NiS. This result suggests that the rational design and fabrication of ternary CQDs-based systems are important for the efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This study provides a strategy for developing highly efficient noble-metal-free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution using CQDs as a bridge to promote the charge transfer in the nanocomposite.",

     "abstract": "The development of efficient photocatalytic H2-evolution materials requires both rapid electron transfer and an effective interfacial catalysis reaction for H2 production. In addition to the well-known noble metals, low-cost and earth-abundant non-noble metals can also act as electron-transfer mediators to modify photocatalysts. However, as almost all non-noble metals lack the interfacial catalytic active sites required for the H2-evolution reaction, the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance is limited. Therefore, the development of new interfacial active sites on metal-modified photocatalysts is of considerable importance. In this study, to enhance the photocatalytic evolution of H2 by Ni-modified TiO2, the formation of NiSx as interfacial active sites was promoted on the surface of Ni nanoparticles. Specifically, the co-modified TiO2/Ni-NiSx photocatalysts were prepared via a two-step process involving the photoinduced deposition of Ni on the TiO2 surface and the subsequent formation of NiSx on the Ni surface by a hydrothermal reaction method. It was found that the TiO2/Ni-NiSx photocatalysts exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H2-evolution activity. In particular, TiO2/Ni-NiSx(30%) showed the highest photocatalytic rate (223.74 \u03bcmol h\u22121), which was greater than those of TiO2, TiO2/Ni, and TiO2/NiSx by factors of 22.2, 8.0, and 2.2, respectively. The improved H2-evolution performance of TiO2/Ni-NiSx could be attributed to the excellent synergistic effect of Ni and NiSx, where Ni nanoparticles function as effective mediators to transfer electrons from the TiO2 surface and NiSx serves as interfacial active sites to capture H+ ions from solution and promote the interfacial H2-evolution reaction. The synergistic effect of the non-noble metal cocatalyst and the interfacial active sites may provide new insights for the design of highly efficient photocatalytic materials.",

In the synthesized ternary Bi/BiOI/(BiO)2CO3, the oxygen vacancies, dual heterojunctions (i.e., Bi/BiOI and BiOI/(BiO)2CO3), and surface plasmon resonance effect of the Bi particles contributed to efficient electron-hole separation and an increase in charge carrier concentration, thus boosting the overall visible light photocatalysis efficiency.

The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm was 3.66%. Further detailed characterizations revealed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the MoS2/CdS heterojunctions could be attributed to the efficient transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers resulting from the core-shell structure and the close contact between MoS2 nanosheets and CdS single-crystal nanorods, as well as to increased visible light absorption.

Herein, we report on the use of an organic molecule, oxamide (OA), as a novel co-catalyst to enhance electron-hole separation, photocatalytic H2 evolution, and dye degradation over TiO2 nanosheets. OA-modified TiO2 samples were prepared by a wet chemical route and demonstrated improved light absorption in the visible-light region and more efficient charge transport.

The hydrogen evolution rate reached \u223c305.4 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121, which is about three times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4, and the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was \u223c0.45% at \u03bb = 420. Furthermore, the Ni3N/g-C3N4 photocatalyst showed no obvious decrease in the hydrogen production rate, even after five cycles under visible-light irradiation. Finally, a possible photocatalytic hydrogen evolution mechanism for the Ni3N/g-C3N4 system is proposed.",

     "abstract": "Photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions on pristine graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4), as a promising approach for converting solar energy to fuel, are attractive for tackling global energy concerns but still suffer from low efficiencies. In this article, we report a tractable approach to modifying g-C3N4 with vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc/CN) for efficient visible-light-driven hydrogen production. A non-covalent VOPc/CN hybrid photocatalyst formed via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between the two components, as confirmed by analysis of UV-vis absorption spectra. The VOPc/CN hybrid photocatalyst shows excellent visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance and good stability. Under optimal conditions, the corresponding H2 evolution rate is nearly 6 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. The role of VOPc in promoting hydrogen evolution activity was to extend the visible light absorption range and prevent the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs effectively. It is expected that this facile modification method could be a new inspiration for the rational design and exploration of g-C3N4-based hybrid systems with strong light absorption and high-efficiency carrier separation.",

To obtain a molecular-level understanding of their surface chemistry, controlled synthesis of ceria with well-defined surface structures is required. We have thus studied the growth of CeOx nanostructures (NSs) and thin films on Pt(111). The strong metal-oxide interaction has often been invoked to explain catalytic processes over the Pt/CeOx catalysts. However, the Pt-CeOx interaction has not been understood at the atomic level. We show here that the interfacial interaction between Pt and ceria could indeed affect the surface structures of ceria, which could subsequently determine their catalytic chemistry. While ceria on Pt(111) typically exposes the CeO2(111) surface, we found that the structures of ceria layers with a thickness of three layers or less are highly dynamic and dependent on the annealing temperatures, owing to the electronic interaction between Pt and CeOx. A two-step kinetically limited growth procedure was used to prepare the ceria film that fully covers the Pt(111) substrate. For a ceria film of ~3\u20134 monolayer (ML) thickness on Pt(111), annealing in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at 1000 K results in a surface of CeO2 (100), stabilized by a c-Ce2O3(100) buffer layer.

Thermogravimetric analysis, XRD and Raman results indicated that the dehydration process of FeOx at room temperature causes the almost completely loss of water molecule with no bulk structural changes.

Here, the novel efficient composite PoPD/AgCl/g-C3N4 nanosheets was first synthesized by a precipitation reaction and the photoinitiated polymerization approach.

However, only separated phases of CoO and MnO were found in the reduced sample supported by SiO2, and Co2C nanospheres were detected in the spent catalyst without the evidence of any Co2C nanoprisms. The Co2C nanospheres led to a relatively high methane selectivity of 5.8 C% and 12.0 C% of the \u03b3-Al2O3- and SiO2-supported catalysts, respectively.

The metal cations incorporation introduces extra diffusion hindrance by metallic species located in the cavity of SAPO-34. In particular, the Zn cations-modified SAPO-34 catalysts exhibit core-shell like structure, with Si-rich and Zn-rich sublayer near the external surface, which favors the coke deposition at the beginning of MTO reaction, exerts marked impact on the diffusion of the generated products with relatively large molecular size (e.g. propylene), and significantly increases the selectivity to ethylene and the ratio of ethylene to propene in the MTO reaction.",

The structure, morphology, texture, optical properties, and photocatalytic performance of the prepared Sep@LDH were studied in detail. Among the Sep@LDH composites, Sep4@LDH (4.0 g Sep) exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation, which could be attributed to its large surface area, high crystallinity, and plentiful active sites on its surface. The photodegradation of the dyes followed a pseudo first-order kinetic model (Langmuir-Hinshelwood model), indicating that the copious and homogeneous active sites on the surface of the composites contributed to the high photocatalytic activity. The photodegradation mechanism was studied by examining the active species (\u2022OH, h+, and \u2022O2\u2212 anions) using appropriate scavengers.

Therefore, in this study, three-dimensional multifunctional FexOy/N-GN/CNTs (N-GN: nitrogen-doped graphene, CNTs: carbon nanotubes) heterojunctions, which can be employed as microwave absorbers and catalysts, were synthesized via a solvothermal method and applied to activate peroxymonosulfate for the degradation of methylene blue (MB). X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the FexOy were anchored in-situ onto the N-GN network. Using MB as the model organic dye, various factors, such as degradation systems, PMS loading, initial organic pollutant concentration, and catalyst dosage were optimized. The results revealed that the remarkable efficiency was attributable to the synergistic effects of carbon, nitrogen, and iron-based species. The oxidation system corresponded to the pseudo-first-order kinetic with a k value of \u223c0.33 min\u22121. It was demonstrated that both SO4\u2022\u2212 and OH\u2022 were the predominant reactive species through quenching experiments.

The effects of doping content of C-I codoping with different amounts of ionic liquid on the structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of the samples were investigated. Characterization results show that more compact interlayer sacking can be achieved by post-thermal treatment. Combined with C-I codoping by insertion of ionic liquids, much enlarged surface area but optimized sp2 conjugated heterocyclic structure can be found in the catalysts. Optical and energy band analysis results evidence that the light absorptions especially in visible light region are significantly improved. Although the band gap of porous C-I codoped samples enlarge because of the generation of porous, the negatively shifted conduction band position thermodynamically supplies stronger motivation for water reduction. Photoelectricity tests reveal that the photo-induced electron density was increased after C-I codoping modification. Also, the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs is remarkably inhibited. The catalysts with moderate C-I codoing content perform sharply enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under visible light irradiation.

The catalytic performances of the Cu-LaCoO3 catalysts were found to depend on the Cu loading and pretreatment conditions. The catalyst with 10 wt% Cu loading exhibited the best catalytic performance after prereduction in 5%H2-95%N2, achieving a high FFA conversion of 100% and selectivity of 55.5% for 1,5-pentanediol (40.3%) and 1,2-pentanediol (15.2%) at 413 K and 6 MPa H2. This catalyst could be reused four times without a loss of FFA conversion but it resulted in a slight decrease in pentanediol selectivity. Correlation between the structural changes in the catalysts at different states and the simultaneous variation in the catalytic performance revealed that cooperative catalysis between Cu0 and CoO promoted the hydrogenolysis of FFA to PeDs, especially to 1,5-PeD, while Co0 promoted the hydrogenation of FFA to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). Therefore, it is suggested that a synergetic effect between balanced Cu0 and CoO sites plays a critical role in achieving a high yield of PeDs with a high 1,5-/1,2-pentanediol selectivity ratio during FFA hydrogenolysis.",

Here we report a strategy, composed of hydro-demethoxylation and de-alkylation reactions, that is able to chemically converge various lignin-derived phenolic monomers into phenol in a single-step. Using 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol as a model compound, Pt/C exhibited the best performance in hydro-demethoxylation reaction affording >80% 4-propylphenol from 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol, while H-ZSM-5 was identified as the most suitable catalyst for de-alkylation, achieving 83% yield of phenol from 4-propylphenol. Since the two catalysts operate under compatible conditions, combining the two catalysts to simultaneously promote both hydro-demethoxylation and de-alkylation reactions was achieved. Configuration of how to organize the catalysts is a critical parameter, where the physical mixture of the two was most effective, providing over 60% phenol from 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol in a single-step.",

The composite 3%-AgVO3/MoS2 catalyst demonstrated a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to the pure compounds (AgVO3 and MoS2). The reason behind the excellent photocatalytic performance was the modification of MoS2 by AgVO3 to facilitate O2 adsorption/activation. In addition, the composite catalyst facilitates the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction whereby H2O2 is generated on the surface of MoS2 to produce additional reactive oxygen species (ROSs). ESR coupled with the POPHA fluorescence detection method and a free radical capture experiment were used to elucidate the mechanism of formation of the ROSs, including \u2022OH, \u2022O2\u2212 and H2O2. Furthermore, the generation of additional ROSs could accelerate electron consumption, leaving behind more holes for the oxidation of organic pollutants.

Combined density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling reveal that the selectivity and activity of the Pd catalyst for acetylene hydrogenation can both be substantially influenced by the effects of Pd lattice strain variation and subsurface carbon species formation on the adsorption properties of the reactants and products. It is found that the adsorption energies of the reactants and products are, in general, linearly scaled with the lattice strain for both pristine and subsurface carbon atom-modified Pd(111) surfaces, except for the adsorption of C2H2 over Pd(111)-C. The activity for ethylene formation typically corresponds to the region of strong reactants adsorption in the volcano curve; such an effect of lattice strain and the presence of subsurface promoters can improve the activity of the catalyst through the weakening of the adsorption of reactants. The activity and selectivity for Pd(111)-C are always higher than those for the pristine Pd(111) surfaces with respect to ethylene formation. Based on the results obtained, Pd-based catalysts with shrinking lattice constants are suggested as good candidates for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene. A similar approach can be used to facilitate the future design of novel heterogeneous catalysts.",

Detailed energetic, structural, and electronic properties of these reactions are determined. The calculated activation energies of the breaking of the first and second C\u2013H bonds of propane on the VO3/CeO2(111) catalyst are compared, and it is found that both the unique structural and electronic effects of the VO3/CeO2(111) catalyst contribute to the relatively easy rupture of the first C\u2013H bond of the propane molecule during the ODH reaction. In particular, the so-called new empty localized states that are mainly constituted of O 2p orbitals of the ceria-supported VO3 species are determined to be crucial for assisting the cleavage of the first C\u2013H bond of the propane molecule. Following this they become occupied and the remaining C\u2013H bonds become increasingly difficult to break owing to the increasing repulsion between the localized 4f electrons at the Ce cations, resulting in the adsorption of more H and other moieties. This work illustrates that CeO2-supported monomeric vanadium oxides can exhibit unique activity and selectivity for the catalytic ODH of alkanes to alkenes.",

     "abstract": "C1 chemistry is the essence of coal chemistry and natural gas chemistry. Catalytic methods to efficiently convert C1 molecules into fuels and chemicals have been extensively studied. Syngas (CO + H2) conversion is the most important industrial reaction system in C1 chemistry, and Fe and Co catalysts, two major industrial catalysts, have been the focus of fundamental research and industrial application. In the last decade, considerable research efforts have been devoted to discoveries concerning catalyst structure and increasing market demands for olefins and oxygenates. Since the development of efficient catalysts would strongly benefit from catalyst design and the establishment of a new reaction system, this review comprehensively overviews syngas conversion in three main reactions, highlights the advances recently made and the challenges that remain open, and will stimulate future research activities. The first part of the review summarizes the breakthroughs in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis regarding the optimization of activity and stability, determination of the active phase, and mechanistic studies. The second part overviews the modulation of catalytic structure and product selectivity for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO). Catalysts designed to produce higher alcohols, as well as to tune product selectivity in C1 chemistry, are described in the third section. Finally, present challenges in syngas conversion are proposed, and the solutions and prospects are discussed from the viewpoint of fundamental research and practical application. This review summarizes the latest advances in the design, preparation, and application of Fe/Co-based catalysts toward syngas conversion and presents the challenges and future directions in producing value-added fuels.",

     "abstract": "Vanadium-titanium-based catalysts are the most widely used industrial materials for NOx removal from coal-fired power plants. Owing to their relatively poor low-temperature deNOx activity, low thermal stability, insufficient Hg0 oxidation activity, SO2 oxidation, ammonia slip, and other disadvantages, modifications to traditional vanadium-titanium-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts have been attempted by many researchers to promote their relevant performance. This article reviewed the research progress of modified vanadium-titanium-based SCR catalysts from seven aspects, namely, (1) improving low-temperature deNOx efficiency, (2) enhancing thermal stability, (3) improving Hg0 oxidation efficiency, (4) oxidizing slip ammonia, (5) reducing SO2 oxidation, (6) increasing alkali resistance, and (7) others. Their catalytic performance and the influence mechanisms have been discussed in detail. These catalysts were also divided into different categories according to their modified components such as noble metals (e.g., silver, ruthenium), transition metals (e.g., manganese, iron, copper, zirconium, etc.), rare earth metals (e.g., cerium, praseodymium), and other metal chlorides (e.g., calcium chloride, copper chloride) and non-metals (fluorine, sulfur, silicon, nitrogen, etc.). The advantages and disadvantages of these catalysts were summarized. Based on previous studies and the author's point of view, doping the appropriate modified components is beneficial to further improve the overall performance of vanadium-titanium-based SCR catalysts. This has enormous development potential and is a promising way to realize the control of multiple pollutants on the basis of the existing flue gas treatment system.",

It is worth noting that the 3D TiO2 hollow nanoboxes are assembled from six single-crystal nanosheets and have dominant exposure of the {001} facets. It is found from EPR spectra that adding zinc powder is an environment-friendly and effective strategy to introduce Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy (Ov) into the bulk of 3D hollow nanoboxes rather than the surface, which is responsible for their enhanced visible photocatalytic properties. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by measuring the formation rate of hydroxide free radicals using 7-hydroxycoumarin as a probe. The sample prepared with zinc/TiOF2 mass ratio of 0.25 exhibited the highest RhB photodegradation activity under visible-light irradiation with a degradation rate of 96%, which is 4.0-times higher than that of pure TiO2.

Among the synthesized catalysts, the TiO2-modified Mn2O3-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst shows markedly improved low-temperature OCM performance, achieving a high CH4 conversion of ~23% and a good C2-C3 selectivity of ~73% at 700 \u00b0C (the catalyst bed temperature), along with promising stability for at least 300 h without signs of deactivation.

It is found that Na2H2EDTA treatment can selectively remove the surface Al atoms, but generates new acid sites (likely silanol nests) on the external surface. H3PO4 treatment is unable to remove surface Al atoms, while small amount of P is left on the external surface, which effectively decreases the acid density. The catalytic performance of the resultant materials is evaluated in the methanol conversion reaction. H3PO4 treatment can effectively improve both the catalytic lifetime and the stability of propene selectivity. This occurs due to a combination of the increased tolerance to the external coke deposition and the depressed coking rate (reduced side reactions). Na2H2EDTA treatment only prolongs the catalytic lifetime, resulting from the improved tolerance to the external coke deposition. Under the optimized H3PO4 treatment condition, the resultant ZSM-5 gives a catalytic lifetime of about 1.5 times longer than the precursor. Moreover, the propene selectivity is improved, showing a slight increasing trend until the deactivation.",

Developing green and sustainable strategies for NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions, using renewable energy, is strongly desired, by both industrial and scientific researchers. Artificial photosynthesis for ammonia synthesis, which has recently attracted significant attention, directly produces NH3 from sunlight, and N2 and H2O via photocatalysis. This has been regarded as an ideal, energy-saving and environmentally-benign process for NH3 production because it can be performed under normal temperature and atmospheric pressure using renewable solar energy. Although sustainable developments have been achieved since the pioneering work in 1977, many challenging issues (e.g., adsorption and activation of nitrogen molecules on the surface of photocatalysts under mild conditions) have still not been well solved and the photocatalytic activities are generally low. In this miniature review, I summarize the most recent progress of photocatalytic N2 fixation for ammonia synthesis, focusing specifically on two attractive aspects for adsorption and activation of nitrogen molecules: one is engineering of oxygen vacancies, and the other is mimicking natural nitrogenase for constructing artificial systems for N2 fixation. Several representative works focusing on these aspects in artificial systems have been reported recently, and it has been demonstrated that both factors play more significant roles in photocatalytic N2 reduction and fixation under ambient conditions. At the end of the review, I also give some remarks and perspective on the existing challenges and future directions in this field.",

Achieving a complete oxidation of methane under 400 \u00b0C remains challenging, and whether Ni3+ or Co3+ is the active center for the catalytic combustion of methane is a controversial issue. Therefore, we designed a series of spinel oxide catalysts by exposing different amounts of Ni3+ and Co3+ deposited on the surface by hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods in order to study the influence of high oxidation state (Ni3+ and Co3+) on surface and catalytic activity. The catalytic performance increased almost linearly with increasing Ni3+ + Co3+ on the surface of the catalyst. Thus, we are convinced that Ni3+ and Co3+ both act as active centers. The amount of Ni3+ + Co3+ on a hydrothermal 60 h NiCo2O4 nanosheet surface is the highest, and reveals the best catalytic performance with T50 (50% methane conversion) at about 280 \u00b0C. 10 vol% H2O added to the system has little impact on activity, especially at high space velocities due to the long hydrothermal time with less absorbed oxygen species and crystal defects.

The catalyst prepared using a pyrolysis temperature of 900 \u00b0C (labeled Co-N/m-C-900) exhibited the best performance. The strong coordination between the ultra-dispersed cobalt species and the pyridine nitrogen as well as the large area of the mesoporous surface resulted in a high turnover frequency value (107.6 mol methyl benzoate mol\u22121 Co h\u22121) for the direct aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to methyl benzoate. This value is much higher than those of state-of-the-art transition-metal-based nanocatalysts reported in the literature. Moreover, the catalyst exhibited general applicability to various structurally diverse alcohols, including benzylic, allylic, and heterocyclic alcohols, achieving the target esters in high yields. In addition, a preliminary evaluation revealed that Co-N/m-C-900 can be used six times without significant activity loss. In general, the process was rapid, simple, and cost-effective.",

Employing periodic density functional theory calculations, the olefin-based cycle was studied using tetramethylethene (TME) as a representative olefinic hydrocarbon pool in H-SAPO-18 zeotype. The overall free energy barrier at 673 K was calculated and found to be less than 150 kJ/mol in the TME-based cycle, much lower than those in the aromatic-based cycle (> 200 kJ/mol), indicating that olefins themselves are the dominant active hydrocarbon pool species in H-SAPO-18. The similarity of the intermediates involved between the aromatic-based cycle and the olefin-based cycle was also highlighted, revealing that both cycles were pattern-consistent. The selectivity related to the distribution of cracking precursors, such as higher olefins or carbenium ions, as a result of the olefin-based cycle for the MTO conversion. The enthalpy barrier of the cracking step scaled linearly with the number of carbon atoms of cracking precursors to produce ethene or propene with ethene being much less favored than propene for cracking of C7 and higher precursors.

High angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurement results show that most of the Ir species on Ir-La-S/AC exist as single atomic sites, while those on Ir-La/AC exist as nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.5 nm. Evaluation of Ir-La-S/AC as a catalyst for heterogeneous carbonylation of methanol to acetyl gave a maximum TOF (turn-over-frequency) of 2760 h\u22121, which was distinctly higher than that achieved by the Ir-La/AC catalyst (approximately 1000 h\u22121). Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) result shows that the addition of sulfuric acid during the preparation procedure results in significantly more acidic sites on Ir-La-S/AC than those on Ir-La/AC, which plays a key role in the enhancement of CO insertion as the rate-determining step. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that Ir species are more reducible, and that more Ir+ might be formed by activation of Ir-La-S/AC than those on the Ir-La/AC catalyst, which is thought to be beneficial for reductive elimination of AcI from Ir3+ species as an essential step for CH3I regeneration and acetyl formation.",

Recent progress has revealed that boron nitride is a highly promising catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes because of its superior selectivity for and high productivity of light alkenes, negligible formation of CO2, and remarkable catalyst stability. From this viewpoint, recent works on boron nitride in the oxidative dehydrogenations of ethane, propane, butane, and ethylbenzene are reviewed, and the emphasis of this viewpoint is placed on discussing the catalytic origin of boron nitride in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. After analyzing recent progress in the use of boron nitride for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and finding much new evidence, we conclude that pure boron nitride is catalytically inert, and an activation period is required under the reaction conditions; this process is accompanied by an oxygen functionalization at the edge of boron nitride; the B-O species themselves have no catalytic activity in C-H cleavage, and the B-OH groups, with the assistance of molecular oxygen, play the key role in triggering the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane; the dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen is involved in the reaction process; and a straightforward strategy for preparing an active boron nitride catalyst with hydroxyl groups at the edges can efficiently enhance the catalytic efficacy. A new redox reaction cycle based on the B-OH sites is also proposed. Furthermore, as this is a novel catalytic system, there is an urgent need to develop new methods to optimize the catalytic performances, clarify the catalytic function of boron species in the alkane ODH reactions, and disclose the reaction mechanism under realistic reaction conditions.",

Electrochemical analysis reveals that the oxide on the surface is essential for the electrocatalysis of the CO2 reduction reaction.

We mainly focused on understanding the role of graphene coating through investigation of catalytic performance and adsorption behavior of the composite. Compared with the traditional Pd/Cor catalyst without graphene coating, Pd/Gr/Cor catalyst delivered much higher activity and stability for toluene catalytic combustion in both dry and moist conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and hydrophobic characterizations indicated that graphene coating can considerably improve the dispersity of Pd nanoparticles and enhance the hydrophobicity of the cordierite support. The adsorption behavior of the above two catalysts, including adsorption isothermal, adsorption kinetics, and adsorption thermodynamics were carefully investigated. The simulation results indicated that a large amount of toluene was adsorbed on graphene surface through relatively weak interaction, whereas only a relatively small amount of toluene was adsorbed on Pd surface with strong affinity. The adsorption thermal calculation indicated that the adsorption of toluene on graphene was a process with reduced entropy, indicating highly-ordered assembly of toluene molecular on graphene. It is the significant concentration and affinity gap between graphene and Pd that ensures a simultaneously and rapid transfer of toluene during the reaction process.",

In this paper, we report the fabrication of graphitic-carbon-mediated ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) with enhanced photocatalytic activity and photostability for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. ZnO NRA/C-x (x = 005, 01, 02, and 03) nanohybrids are prepared by calcining pre-synthesized ZnO NRAs with different amounts of glucose (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 g) as a carbon source via a hydrothermal method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the obtained ZnO NRA/C-x nanohybrids are imparted with the effects of both carbon doping and carbon coating, as evidenced by the detected C\u2212O\u2212Zn bond and the C\u2212C, C\u2212O and C=O bonds, respectively. While the basic structure of ZnO remains unchanged, the UV-Vis absorption spectra show increased absorbance owing to the carbon doping effect in the ZnO NRA/C-x nanohybrids. The photoluminescence (PL) intensities of ZnO NRA/C-x nanohybrids are lower than that of bare ZnO NRA, indicating that the graphitic carbon layer coated on the surface of the ZnO NRA significantly enhances the charge carrier separation and transport, which in turn enhances the photoelectrochemical property and photocatalytic activity of the ZnO NRA/C-x nanohybrids for CO2 reduction. More importantly, a long-term reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction demonstrates that the photostability of ZnO NRA/C-x nanohybrids is significantly increased in comparison with the bare ZnO NRA.",

These catalysts had a well-defined and highly ordered macroporous nanostructure with an average pore size of 280 nm. In addition, ultrafine hemispherical Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean particle size of 1.1 nm were found to be well dispersed over the surface of the 3DOM-TiO2 support and deposited on the inner walls of the material. The nanostructure of the 3DOM-TiO2 support ensured efficient contact between soot particles and the catalyst. The large interface area between the ultrafine Pd NPs and the TiO2 also increased the density of sites for O2 activation as a result of the strong metal (Pd)-support (TiO2) interaction (SMSI). A Pd/3DOM-TiO2-GBMR catalyst with ultrafine Pd NPs (1.1 nm) exhibited higher catalytic activity during diesel soot combustion compared with that obtained from a specimen having relatively large Pd NPs (5.0 nm).

However, the mechanism of photo-thermal catalysis of the MnOx/g-C3N4 composite remains unresolved. In this paper, MnOx/g-C3N4 catalysts with different molar ratios were synthesized by the precipitation approach at room temperature. The as-prepared catalysts exhibit excellent synergistic photo-thermal catalytic performance towards the purification of NO in air. The MnOx/g-C3N4 catalysts contain MnOx with different valence states on the surface of g-C3N4. The thermal catalytic reaction for NO oxidation on MnOx and the photo-thermal catalytic reaction on 1:5 MnOx/g-C3N4 were investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS). The results show that light exerted a weak effect on NO oxidation over MnOx, and it exerted a positive synergistic effect on NO conversion over 1:5 MnOx/g-C3N4. A synergistic photo-thermal catalytic cycle of NO oxidation on MnOx/g-C3N4 is proposed. Specifically, photo-generated electrons (e\u2212) are transferred to MnOx and participate in the synergistic photo-thermal reduction cycle (Mn4+\u2192Mn3+\u2192Mn2+). The reverse cycle (Mn2+\u2192Mn3+\u2192Mn4+) can regenerate the active oxygen vacancy sites and inject electrons into the g-C3N4 hole (h+). The active oxygen (O\u2212) was generated in the redox cycles among manganese species (Mn4+/Mn3+/Mn2+) and could oxidize the intermediates (NOH and N2O2\u2212) to final products (NO2\u2212 and NO3\u2212).

Mn-40 catalyst has a higher TOF (0.11 s\u22121 at 120 \u00b0C) and the best catalytic activity for ethanol oxidation because of a bigger pore size with three pore systems with maximum distribution at 1.9, 3.4, and 6.6 nm, decrease in symmetry and degree of order, more surface lattice oxygen species, oxygen vacancies resulting from more Mn3+ ions, and better low-temperature reducibility.",

In this paper, a novel g-C3N4 nanosheet-based composite was constructed via in situ growth of bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) nanoplates on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets. The crystal phase, microstructure, optical absorption and textural properties of the synthesized photocatalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements. The BiOI/g-C3N4 nanosheet composite showed high activity and recyclability for the photodegradation of the target pollutant rhodamine B (RhB). The conversion of RhB (20 mg L\u22121) by the photocatalyst was nearly 100% after 50 min under visible-light irradiation. The high photoactivity of the BiOI/g-C3N4 nanosheet composite can be attributed to the enhanced visible-light absorption of the g-C3N4 nanosheets sensitized by BiOI nanoplates as well as the high charge separation efficiency obtained by the establishment of an internal electric field between the n-type g-C3N4 and p-type BiOI. Based on the characterization and experimental results, a double-transfer mechanism of the photoinduced electrons in the BiOI/g-C3N4 nanosheet composite was proposed to explain its activity.

Furthermore, the optimum mass ratio of CeO2 in the CeO2/NaNbO3 composites is 2.0 wt%. The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the higher separation rate of the photo-induced electrons and holes, and the higher migration rate of the photogenerated charge in the interfacial region.

In terms of catalytic performance, Pd/TiN showed enhanced efficiency and stability compared with those of Pd/C and bare TiN in the electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination (EHDC) reaction of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in aqueous solution. The superior performance of Pd/TiN arises from the promotion effect of TiN. Strong metal-support interactions modified the electronic structure of Pd, which optimized generation of H*ads and 2,4-DCP adsorption/activation. The cathode potential plays a vital role in controlling the EHDC efficiency and the product distribution. A working potential of \u20130.80 V was shown to be optimal for achieving the highest EHDC efficiency and maximizing conversion of 2,4-DCP to phenol (P).

The IBP decay in the PCF process is much faster than that with the conventional UV, UV/H2O2, Fenton, photo-Fenton, and photocatalysis processes. The kinetics analysis showed that the IBP decay follows a two-stage pseudo-first order profile, that is, a fast IBP decay (k1) followed by a slow decay (k2). The effects of various parameters, including initial pH level, dosage of Fenton's reagent and TiO2, wavelength of UV irradiation, and initial IBP concentration, are evaluated. The optimum pH level, [Fe2+]0, [Fe2+]0/[H2O2]0 molar ratio, and [TiO2]0 are determined to be approximately 4.22, 0.20 mmol/L, 1/40, and 1.0 g/L, respectively. The IBP decay at circumneutral pH (i.e., 6.0\u20138.0 for wastewater) shows the same IBP decay efficiency as that at the optimum pH of 4.22 after 30 min, which suggests that the PCF process is applicable for the treatment of wastewater in the circumneutral pH range.

Bromides are considered effective additives to improve Hg0 oxidation on SCR catalysts. In this work, the effects of different bromides (NH4Br, NaBr, KBr, and CaBr2) on a commercial V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst were studied. NOx conversion decreased significantly over the KBr-poisoned catalyst (denoted as L-KBr), while that over NaBr- and CaBr2-poisoned catalysts (denoted as L-NaBr and L-CaBr, respectivity) decreased to a lesser extent compared with the fresh sample. Poor N2 selectivity was observed over L-NaBr, L-KBr and L-CaBr catalysts. The decrease in the ratio of chemisorbed oxygen to total surface oxygen (O\u03b1/(O\u03b1 + O\u03b2 + Ow)), reducibility and surface acidity might contribute to the poor activity and N2 selectivity over L-KBr catalyst. The increased O\u03b1 ratio was conducive to the enhanced reducibility of L-CaBr. Combined with enhanced surface acidity, this might offset the negative effect of the loss of active sites by CaBr2 covering. The overoxidation of NH3 and poor N2 selectivity in NH3 oxidation should retard the SCR activity at high temperatures over L-CaBr catalyst. The increased basicity might contribute to increased NOx adsorption on L-KBr and L-CaBr catalysts. A correlation between the acid-basic and redox properties of bromide-poisoned catalysts and their catalytic properties is established.",

The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6@Bi2S3 was attributed to the photosensitization of Bi2S3, which greatly extended the light-responsive range from the visible to the NIR, and the formation of a heterojunction, which retarded the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. However, further increases in the amount of Na2S\u00b79H2O (from 1.5 to 3.0 g) resulted in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity of the Bi2WO6@Bi2S3 nanoplates owing to the formation of a photo-inactive NaBiS2 layer covering the Bi2WO6 surface.",

In this paper, visible-light-responsive N and S co-doped TiO2-HNBs were prepared by calcining the mixture of cubic TiOF2 and methionine (C5H11NO2S), a N- and S-containing biomacromolecule. The effect of calcination temperature on the structure and performance of the TiO2-HNBs was systematically studied. It was found that methionine can prevent TiOF2-to-anatase TiO2 phase transformation. Both N and S elements are doped into the lattice of TiO2-HNBs when the mixture of TiOF2 and methionine undergoes calcination at 400 \u00b0C, which is responsible for the visible-light response.

The enhanced visible photoreactivity of methionine-modified TiO2-HNBs is also confirmed by photocatalytic oxidation of NO. The successful doping of N and S elements into the lattice of TiO2-HNBs, resulting in the improved light-harvesting ability and efficient separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, is responsible for the enhanced visible photocatalytic activity of methionine-modified TiO2-HNBs.

The surface of the hierarchical porous carbon supported a large number of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which were derived from dicyandiamide through the catalysis of Co. The addition of Co resulted in the formation of a hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure, which was beneficial for the exposure of active sites and rapid transportation of ORR-relevant species (O2, H+, OH\u2212, and H2O).

After modification, the band gap energy of Bi2WO6/ZnO is reduced from 3.2 eV for ZnO to 2.6 eV. Under visible light irradiation, the Bi2WO6/ZnO composite shows an excellent photocatalytic activity for degrading methylene blue (MB) and tetracycline. The photo-degradation efficiencies of (0.3:1) Bi2WO6/ZnO for MB and tetracycline are approximately 246 and 4500 times higher than those of bare ZnO, respectively, and correspondingly, the photo-degradation rates for the two pollutants are approximately 120 and 200 times higher than those with bare ZnO, respectively. Moreover, the photocatalyst of (0.3:1) Bi2WO6/ZnO exhibits a higher transient photocurrent density of approximately 4.5 \u03bcA compared with those of bare Bi2WO6 and ZnO nanoparticles. The successful recombination of Bi2WO6 and ZnO enhances the photocatalytic activity and reduces the band gap energy of ZnO, which can be attributed to the effective separation of electron\u2013hole pairs.

The PPy/g-C3N4 is applied to the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. Various characterization techniques are employed to investigate the relationship between the structural properties and photoactivities of the as-prepared composites. Results show that the specific surface area of the PPy/g-C3N4 composites increases upon assembly of the amorphous PPy nanoparticles on the g-C3N4 surface. Owing to the strong conductivity, the PPy can be used as a transition channel for electrons to move onto the g-C3N4 surface, thus inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated carriers of g-C3N4 and improving the photocatalytic performance. The elevated light adsorption of PPy/g-C3N4 composites is attributed to the strong absorption coefficient of PPy. The composite containing 0.75 wt% PPy exhibits a photocatalytic efficiency that is 3 times higher than that of g-C3N4 in 2 h. Moreover, the degradation kinetics follow a pseudo-first-order model.

The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy clearly confirmed the existence of Mn, Co, and O, which indicated the successful loading of the active components on the surface of MCM-41. The structure and function of the catalysts were changed by modulating the molar ratio of manganese to cobalt. The 10%MnCo(6:1)/MCM-41 (Mn/Co molar ratio is 6:1) catalyst displayed the best catalytic activity according to the activity evaluation experiments, and chlorobenzene (1000 ppm) was totally decomposed at 270 \u00b0C. The high activity correlated with a high dispersion of the oxides and was attributed to the exposure of more active sites, which was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The strong interactions between MnO2, Co3O4, MnCoOx, and MCM-41 indicated that cobalt promoted the redox cycles of the manganese system. The bimetal-oxide-based catalyst showed better catalytic activity than that of the single metal oxide catalysts, which was further confirmed by H2 temperature-programmed reduction. Chlorobenzene temperature-programmed desorption results showed that 10%MnCo(6:1)/MCM-41 had higher adsorption strength for chlorobenzene than that of single metal catalysts.

Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements all confirm that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 synthesized by the sol-gel method is less than that synthesized through the hydrothermal route. The introduction of oxygen defects contributes to a new state in the band gap that narrows the band gap, which is the reason for the extension of light absorption into the visible light region. The photocurrent results confirm that this band-gap narrowing enhances the photocurrent response under simulated solar light irradiation. The TiO2 with oxygen defects shows a higher photocatalytic activity for decomposition of a methylene blue solution compared with that of the perfect TiO2 sample.

It remains a challenging task to steer the migration of hot electrons and take full advantage of the plasmonic effect to achieve the desired high photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we have developed an efficient strategy to steer the migration of plasmonic hot electrons through a well-designed hybrid structure that synergizes a \u201csurface heterojunction\u201d with a Schottky junction. The hybrid structure was synthesized by modifying titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanosheets (NSs) with gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) as a plasmonic metal and platinum (Pt) NPs as a co-catalyst. The \u201csurface heterojunction\u201d formed between two different crystal facets in the TiO2 NSs can induce the injection of plasmonic hot electrons from Au NPs excited by visible light to TiO2. Meanwhile, the Schottky junction formed between the Pt NPs and TiO2 NSs can force the migration of electrons from TiO2 to Pt NPs instead of flowing to Au NPs, attaining the efficient unidirectional transfer of carriers in the Au\u2013TiO2 system. Plasmonic photocatalysts with this design achieved dramatically enhanced activity in full-spectrum photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance measurements were performed in aqueous Na2SO4 solution (0.1 mol L\u22121). We found that a higher applied voltage led to better catalytic performance by AgPW11. The AgPW11-TiO2/ITO electrode gave currents respectively 10 and 2.5 times as high as those of the TiO2/ITO and AgNO3-TiO2/ITO electrodes at an applied voltage of 1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl.

     "abstract": "Water oxidation is significant in both natural and artificial photosynthesis. In nature, water oxidation occurs at the oxygen-evolving center of photosystem II, and leads to the generation of oxygen, protons, and electrons. The last two are used for fixation of carbon dioxide to give carbohydrates. In artificial processes, the coupling of water oxidation to evolve O2 and water reduction to evolve H2 is known as water splitting, which is an attractive method for solar energy conversion and storage. Because water oxidation is a thermodynamically uphill reaction and is kinetically slow, this reaction causes a bottleneck in large-scale water splitting. As a consequence, the development of new and efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) has attracted extensive attention. Recent efforts have identified a variety of mononuclear earth-abundant transition-metal complexes as active and stable molecular WOCs.

First, organic-template-free synthesis of nanozeolite LTA was performed and the obtained material was characterized by various techniques. The average particle size of the LTA crystals was estimated to be 56.1 and 72 nm by X-ray diffraction and particle size analysis, respectively.

Investigation of the electrocatalytic mechanism suggested that oxidation of hydrazine occurred through reaction with Ni3+(Salen)O(OH) and also direct electrooxidation. The anodic peak currents revealed a linear dependence on the square root of the scan rate, indicating a diffusion-controlled process, and the diffusion coefficient of hydrazine was found to be 1.18 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm2/s.

     "abstract": "A series of Mg-Al mixed oxide catalysts are prepared and introduced as efficient irreducible catalysts for the oxidative coupling of alcohols and amines to imine. The structure and surface properties of Mg-Al oxides are modulated by changing the Mg/Al ratios, calcination temperature and treatment with probe molecules. Detailed characterization, including X-ray diffraction, 27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, N2-adsorption, NH3-temperature-programmed desorption, CO2-temperature-programmed desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are carried out to determine the physicochemical properties of these catalysts. The Mg-Al oxides with Mg/Al = 3 exhibit the highest activity in the reaction, which possess a large number of surface weak basic sites and a relatively small number of weak acidic sites. The role of the acidic and basic sites in the reaction process is systematically investigated, and are shown to serve as adsorption and activation sites for amines and alcohols, respectively. Under the synergistic effect of these acid-base centers, the oxidative coupling process successfully occurs on the surface of Mg-Al mixed oxides. Compared with the acidic sites, the weak basic sites play a more important role in the catalytic process. The acidic sites are the catalytic centers for the benzyl alcohol activation, which control the reaction rate of the oxidative coupling reaction.",

First-generation estimates of catalyst viability are based on crustal abundance, which has severe limitations. Herein, we propose a second-generation approach to predicting the viability of novel catalysts prior to industrial implementation to benefit the global chemical industry. Using this prediction, we found that a correlation exists between catalyst consumption and the annual production or price of the catalyst element for 11 representative industrial catalytic processes. Based on this correlation, we have introduced two new descriptors for catalyst viability, namely, catalyst consumption to availability ratio per annum (CCA) and consumed catalyst cost to product value ratio per annum (CCP). Based on evaluations of CCA and CCP for selected industrial reactions, we have grouped catalysts from the case studies according to viability, allowing the identification of general limits of viability based on CCA and CCP. Calculating the CCA and CCP and their comparing with the general limits of viability provides researchers with a novel framework for evaluating whether the cost or physical availability of a new catalyst could be limiting. We have extended this analysis to calculate the predicted limits of economically viable production and product cost for new catalysts.",

Oxides were also synthesized using conventional methods and all specimens were applied to the oxidation of ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, acting as models for the volatile organic compounds found in industrial emissions. The catalysts were also characterized using N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, temperature programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Each of the manganese oxides was found to be very active during the oxidation of both esters to CO2, and the synthesis methodology evidently had a significant impact on catalytic performance. The K-OMS-2 nanorods synthesized by the solvent-free method showed higher activity than K-OMS-2 materials prepared by the reflux technique, and samples with cryptomelane were more active than those prepared by the conventional methods. The catalyst with the highest performance also exhibited good stability and allowed 90% conversion of ethyl and butyl acetate to CO2 at 213 and 202 \u00b0C, respectively. Significant differences in the catalyst performance were observed, clearly indicating that K-OMS-2 nanorods prepared by the solvent-free reaction were better catalysts for the selected VOC oxidations than the mixtures of manganese oxides traditionally obtained with conventional synthesis methods. The superior performance of the K-OMS-2 catalysts might be related to the increased average oxidation state of the manganese in these structures. Significant correlations between the catalytic performance and the surface chemical properties were also identified, highlighting the K-OMS-2 properties associated with the enhanced catalytic performance of the materials.",

Detailed characterizations of the catalysts through X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed techniques were performed to directly monitor the surface chemical properties and the catalytic performance to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Highly dispersed Ru species were observed on the surface of FeOx regardless of the initial Ru loading. Varying the Ru loading resulted in changes to the Ru coverage over the FeOx surface, which had a significant impact on the interaction between Ru and adsorbed H, and concomitantly, the H2 activation capacity via the ability for H2 dissociation. FeOx having 0.01% of Ru loading exhibited 100% selectivity toward CO resulting from the very strong interaction between Ru and adsorbed H, which limits the desorption of the activated H species and hinders over-reduction of CO to CH4. Further increasing the Ru loading of the catalysts to above 0.01% resulted in the adsorbed H to be easily dissociated, as a result of a weaker interaction with Ru, which allowed excessive CO reduction to produce CH4. Understanding how to selectively design the catalyst by tuning the initial loading of the active phase has broader implications on the design of supported metal catalysts toward preparing liquid fuels from CO2.",

The structures, morphologies, and textural properties of the resultant materials were investigated. Initially, with increasing R, the crystal size of the synthesized product decreased, the number of intercrystalline mesopores increased, and a pure ZSM-11 zeolite phase was present. Then an MCM-41-like phase was produced and embedded in the ZSM-11 zeolite phase. Finally, an MCM-41-like phase was obtained. The alkalinity had important effects on the physicochemical and textural properties of the prepared samples. A possible mechanism of formation of the hierarchical ZSM-11 zeolite was proposed on the basis of a combination of various characterization results. The role of CTAB varied depending on the R value, and it showed a capping effect, micellar effect, and template effect. These effects of CTAB were synergetic in ZSM-11 synthesis, but they were competitive with the structure-directing effect of TBABr. In addition, the impact of the acidic properties and porosities of the hierarchical ZSM-11 catalysts on their performances in the alkylation of benzene with dimethyl ether was investigated.",

     "abstract": "Photocatalytic conversion of \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d CO2 is considered to be one of the most effective ways to alleviate current energy and environmental problems without additional energy consumption and pollutant emission. The performance of many traditional semiconductor photocatalysts is not efficient enough to satisfy the requirements of practical applications because of their limited specific surface area and low CO2 adsorption capacity. Therefore, the exploration of photocatalysts with high CO2 uptake is significant in the field of CO2 conversion. Recently the porous materials appeared to be a kind of superior candidate for enriching the CO2 molecules on the surface of photocatalysts for catalytic conversion. This paper first summarizes the advances in the development of nanoporous adsorbents for CO2 capture. Three main classes of porous materials are considered: inorganic porous materials, metal organic frameworks, and microporous organic polymers. Based on systematic research on CO2 uptake, we then highlight the recent progress in these porous-material-based photocatalysts for CO2 conversion. Benefiting from the improved CO2 uptake capacity, the porous-material-based photocatalysts exhibited remarkably enhanced efficiency in the reduction of CO2 to chemical fuels, such as CO, CH4, and CH3OH. Based on reported recent achievements, we predict a trend of development in multifunctional materials with both high adsorption capability and photocatalytic performance for CO2 utilization.",

All the experiment results demonstrated that the co-loading of CB and NiS2 could significantly enhance the photocatalytic H2-evolution activity of CdS NSs. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared CdS/CB/NiS2 samples was tested under visible light (\u03bb \u2265 420 nm) by using an aqueous solution containing 0.25 mol L\u22121 Na2S-Na2SO3 as the sacrifice agent. The CdS-0.5%CB-1.0%NiS2 composite photocatalysts exhibited the highest H2-evolution rate of 166.7 \u03bcmol h\u22121, which was approximately 5.16 and 1.87 times higher than those of pure CdS NSs and CdS-1.0%NiS2, respectively. The possible mechanism for the enhanced H2-evolution activity of CdS/CB/NiS2 composite photocatalysts was proposed. The results showed that the enhanced photocatalytic H2-evolution activities could be ascribed to the co-loading of metallic CB and NiS2 as co-catalysts onto the surface of CdS NSs. The excellent synergetic effect between the CB and NiS2 could obviously improve visible light absorption, promote separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and boost the H2-evolution kinetics, thus leading to an enhanced activity for H2 evolution. More interestingly, the metallic CB could not only act as a cocatalyst for H2 evolution, but also serve as a conductive electron bridge to promote the charge migration. This work not only demonstrates that loading CB as a co-catalyst is a promising strategy to further boost the photocatalytic activity of CdS/NiS2 composites, but also offers a new mechanistic insight into the construction of highly efficient and stable CdS NSs-based hybrid photocatalysts with dual earth-abundant co-catalysts for photocatalytic applications.",

     "abstract": "Photocatalytic hydrogen production based on semiconductor photocatalysts has been considered as one of the most promising strategies to resolve the global energy shortage. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been a star visible-light photocatalyst in this field due to its various advantages. However, pristine g-C3N4 usually exhibits limited activity. Herein, to enhance the performance of g-C3N4, alkali metal ion (Li+, Na+, or K+)-doped g-C3N4 are prepared via facile high-temperature treatment. The prepared samples are characterized and analyzed using the technique of XRD, ICP-AES, SEM, UV-vis DRS, BET, XPS, PL, TRPL, photoelectrochemical measurements, photocatalytic tests, etc. The resultant doped photocatalysts show enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activities for hydrogen production, benefiting from the increased specific surface areas (which provide more active sites), decreased band gaps for extended visible-light absorption,land improved electronic structures for efficient charge transfer. In particular, because of the optimal tuning of both microstructure and electronic structure, the Na-doped g-C3N4 shows the most effective utilization of photogenerated electrons during the water reduction process. As a result, the highest photocatalytic performance is achieved over the Na-doped g-C3N4 photocatalyst (18.7 \u03bcmol/h), 3.7 times that of pristine g-C3N4 (5.0 \u03bcmol/h).

     "abstract": "Silver-modified semiconductor photocatalysts typically exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of organic substances. In comparison, their hydrogen-evolution rates are relatively low owing to poor interfacial catalytic reactions to producing hydrogen. In the present study, thiocyanate anions (SCN\u2212) as interfacial catalytic active sites were selectively adsorbed onto the Ag surface of g-C3N4/Ag photocatalyst to promote interfacial H2-evolution reactions. The thiocyanate-modified g-C3N4/Ag (g-C3N4/Ag-SCN) photocatalysts were synthesized via photodeposition of metallic Ag on g-C3N4 and subsequent selective adsorption of SCN\u2212 ions on the Ag surface by an impregnation method. The resulting g-C3N4/Ag-SCN photocatalysts exhibited considerably higher photocatalytic H2-evolution activity than the g-C3N4, g-C3N4/Ag, and g-C3N4/SCN photocatalysts. Furthermore, the g-C3N4/Ag-SCN photocatalyst displayed the highest H2-evolution rate (3.9 \u03bcmol h\u22121) when the concentration of the SCN\u2212 ions was adjusted to 0.3 mmol L\u22121. The H2-evolution rate obtained was higher than those of g-C3N4 (0.15 \u03bcmol h\u22121) and g-C3N4/Ag (0.71 \u03bcmol h\u22121). Considering the enhanced performance of g-C3N4/Ag upon minimal addition of SCN\u2212 ions, a synergistic effect of metallic Ag and SCN\u2212 ions is proposed\u2014the Ag nanoparticles act as an effective electron-transfer mediator for the steady capture and rapid transportation of photogenerated electrons, while the adsorbed SCN\u2212 ions serve as an interfacial active site to effectively absorb protons from solution and promote rapid interfacial H2-evolution reactions. Considering the present facile synthesis and its high efficacy, the present work may provide new insights into preparing high-performance photocatalytic materials.",

The as-prepared samples were analyzed by XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, element mapping, UV-vis DRS, FT-IR, XPS, transient photocurrent response and EIS testing. The results showed that after coupling with trace amounts of N-CQDs, both the photocatalytic activity and stability of Ag2CO3 were greatly boosted. The addition of N-CQDs solution influenced the crystallization of Ag2CO3, resulting in a distinct decrease in Ag2CO3 crystal size and an obvious increase in surface area. Moreover, the charge transfer resistance was greatly reduced, and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes was strongly promoted. The presence of NCQDs on the surface of the catalysts facilitates the transfer of photogenerated electrons, slowing the photocorrosion rate of Ag2CO3, and then resulting in higher stability than bare Ag2CO3 in degradation. The synergistic effect of the improvement of morphology and charge transfer rate thus accounted for the superior photocatalytic performance of N-CQDs/Ag2CO3.",

Our results revealed that the hydrothermal synthesis method greatly influenced the photocatalytic activity of the resultant catalysts. The pristine \u03b2-ZnMoO4 samples obtained under more intensive synthesis conditions (24 h at 280 \u00b0C) showed higher photocatalytic activity than that prepared for 12 h at 180 \u00b0C (denoted \u03b2-ZnMoO4-180). In the case of in situ hydrothermal synthesis of \u03b2-ZnMoO4/g-C3N4, a surface-modified sample was only obtained under the reaction conditions of 180 \u00b0C for 12 h. Compared with the sheet-like \u03b2-ZnMoO4-180 sample, the \u03b2-ZnMoO4-180/g-C3N4 composite showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of SMZ. By contrast, the hydrothermal reaction at 280 \u00b0C caused the gradual decomposition of g-C3N4. It is believed that the structural incorporation of g-C3N4 into \u03b2-ZnMoO4 at 280 \u00b0C might disrupt the crystal growth, thereby deteriorating the performance of the composite catalysts formed at this temperature. For the composite catalysts prepared by the ultrasonic method, a remarkable increase in the degradation rate of SMZ was only observed at a high g-C3N4 content of 8 mol%. The photocatalytic degradation of SMZ by \u03b2-ZnMoO4-180/g-C3N4 composite catalysts followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Further study of the photocatalytic mechanism revealed that holes and superoxide radicals were the dominant oxidative species in the photodegradation process. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composites was attributed to the higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs at heterogeneous junctions. The degradation intermediates of SMZ were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, from which plausible reaction pathways for the photodegradation of SMZ were proposed. Our results indicated that the synthesis method for g-C3N4 composites should be carefully selected to achieve superior photocatalytic performance.",

The different effects of HA on P-TiO2 and Nf-TiO2 photocatalysis cannot be attributed to adsorption changes, because the adsorption capacities of P-TiO2 and Nf-TiO2 were only slightly lower than that of TiO2 at an initial HA concentration of 20 mg/mL. Scavenger tests, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and H2O2 detection were taken to understand the low VL activity of the P-TiO2/HA suspension. The main active species for phenol degradation in the TiO2 and Nf-TiO2 suspensions were superoxide radicals. There were negligible amounts of superoxide radicals in the P-TiO2/HA suspension, possibly because a direct four-electron oxygen reduction reaction occurred. The better VL activity of Nf-TiO2 was rationalized on the basis of Mott\u2013Schottky and electrochemical impedance plots. Nafion modification resulted in cathodic shifts of the energy band positions, increased electron density, and less resistance to electron transfer across the interface between TiO2 and electrolytes. All these factors facilitated electron transfer and improved the production of active species. Phosphate modification therefore did not improve the VL response of HA sensitized TiO2, and low concentrations of HA can facilitate VL photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants on Nafion surface-modified TiO2.",

In this study, surface-fluorinated TiO2-HMSs were assembled from hollow nanoparticles by the hydrothermal reaction of the mixed Ti(SO4)2\u2013NH4HF\u2013H2O2 solution at 180 \u00b0C. The effect of the calcination temperature on the structure and photoreactivity of the TiO2-HMSs was systematically investigated, which was evaluated by photocatalytic oxidation of acetone in air under ultraviolet irradiation. We found that after calcination at 300 \u00b0C, the photoreactivity of the TiO2-HMSs decreases from 1.39 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121 (TiO2-HMS precursor) to 0.82 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121 because of removal of surface-adsorbed fluoride ions. With increasing calcination temperature from 300 to 900 \u00b0C, the building blocks of the TiO2-HMSs evolve from truncated bipyramidal shaped hollow nanoparticles to round solid nanoparticles, and the photoreactivity of the TiO2-HMSs steady increases from 0.82 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 2.09 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121 because of enhanced crystallization. Further increasing the calcination temperature to 1000 and 1100 \u00b0C results in a decrease of the photoreactivity, which is ascribed to a sharp decrease of the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller surface area and the beginning of the anatase\u2013rutile phase transformation at 1100 \u00b0C. The effect of surface-adsorbed fluoride ions on the thermal stability of the TiO2-HMSs is also discussed.",

We observed an improvement of the Fenton and photo-Fenton activities of the Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. This improvement was attributed to efficient charge transfer between Fe3O4 and g-C3N4 at the heterojunctions, inhibition of electron-hole recombination, a high surface area, and stabilization of Fe3O4 against leaching by the hydrophobic g-C3N4. The obtained NPs showed a higher degradation potential for rhodamine B (RhB) dye than those of Fe3O4 and g-C3N4. As compared to photocatalysis, the efficiency of RhB degradation in the Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions was increased by 20% and 90%, respectively. Additionally, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) activity of the prepared nanomaterials was studied with 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidinedihydrochloride (TMB) as a substrate. Dopamine oxidation was also examined. Results indicate that Fe3O4/g\u2013C3N4 nanocomposites offers more efficient degradation of RhB dye in a photo-Fenton system compared with regular photocatalytic degradation, which requires a long time. Our study also confirmed that Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites can be used as a potential material for mimicking HRP owing to its high affinity for TMB. These findings suggest good potential for applications in biosensing and as a catalyst in oxidation reactions.",

Shifting of the TiO2 conduction band edge is frequently applied to increase visible-light absorption but also lowers the reductive properties of photo-excited electrons. Herein, we report a visible-light-driven photocatalyst based on valance band edge control induced by oxygen excess defects and modification with a CuxO electron transfer co-catalyst. The CuxO grafted oxygen-rich TiO2 microspheres were prepared by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of the peroxotitanate precursor followed by a wet chemical impregnated treatment. We found that oxygen excess defects in TiO2 shifted the valence band maximum upward and improved the visible-light absorption. The CuxO grafted onto the surface acted as a co-catalyst that efficiently reduced oxygen molecules to active intermediates (i.e., O2\u00b7\u2013 radial and H2O2), thus consuming the photo-generated electrons. Consequently, the CuxO grafted oxygen-rich TiO2 microspheres achieved a photocatalytic activity respectively 8.6, 13.0 and 11.0 as times high as those of oxygen-rich TiO2, normal TiO2 and CuxO grafted TiO2, for degradation of gaseous acetaldehyde under visible-light irradiation. Our results suggest that high visible-light photocatalytic efficiency can be achieved by combining oxygen excess defects to improve visible-light absorption together with a CuxO electron transfer co-catalyst.

In addition, the photocatalytic performances of the prepared 2D/0D hybrid composites were evaluated based on the photodegradation of rhodamine B under visible-light irradiation. The results demonstrated that the introduction of MoS2 QDs to g-C3N4 greatly enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency. For the optimum 7% MoS2 QD/g-C3N4 photocatalyst, the degradation rate constant was 8.8 times greater than that of pure g-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation.

The effects of the Ni/In ratio and Ni content on the structures and performances of the catalysts were investigated. The results show that In atoms were incorporated into the Ni metal lattice. Although the Ni-In bimetallic crystallites were similar in size to those of monometallic Ni at the same Ni content, H2 uptake by the bimetallic Ni-In catalyst was much lower than that by monometallic Ni because of dilution of Ni atoms by In atoms. Charge transfer from In to Ni was observed for the bimetallic Ni-In catalysts. All the results indicate intimate contact between Ni and In atoms, and the In atoms geometrically and electronically modified the Ni atoms. In the hydrodeoxygenation of anisole, although the activities of the Ni-In bimetallic catalysts in the conversion of anisole were lower than that of the monometallic Ni catalyst, they gave higher selectivities for BTX and cyclohexane as a result of suppression of benzene ring hydrogenation and C\u2013C bond hydrogenolysis. They also showed lower methanation activity. These results will be useful for enhancing carbon yields and reducing H2 consumption. In addition, the lower the Ni/In ratio was, the greater was the effect of In on the catalytic performance.

At 160\u2013170 \u00b0C, MWW phase appeared first and gradually transformed into FER phase over time, indicating that the FER phase was thermodynamically favored. In the piperidine-Na2O-H2O synthetic system, alkalinity proved to be the crucial factor determining the size and textural properties of FER zeolite. Furthermore, the obtained FER samples exhibited good catalytic performance in the skeletal isomerization of 1-butene.",

Raman spectroscopy indicated that the catalyst containing nitrogen created a great quantity of defects in the carbon structures, while nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms showed that the catalyst was mesoporous. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the Fe\u2013N\u2013C catalyst was composed of very thin, curved and porous graphene layers together with some Fe2O3 nanoparticles, and X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed that the carbon in the catalyst was highly graphitized.

The ORR activity of the Fe\u2013N\u2013C catalyst reached a maximum of 4.16 mA cm\u22122, and its chronoamperometric response was found to decrease by only 3% after operating for 3 h at 0.66 V (vs RHE) in an O2-saturated 0.1 mol L\u22121 KOH solution.

The incorporation of Y into the TiO2 lattice inhibited growth of crystalline grains, which increased the specific surface area and enhanced the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic performance of the samples was investigated in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue under visible light irradiation. The rate of methyl blue degradation over the (C, Y)-co-doped TiO2 sample was much higher than those of undoped TiO2, C-TiO2, and Y-TiO2.

     "abstract": "The influence of the magnetism of transition metal oxide, nickel(II) oxide (NiO), on its surface reactivity and the dependence of surface reactivity on surface orientation and reactant magnetism were studied by density functional theory plus U calculations. We considered five different antiferromagnetically ordered structures and one ferromagnetically ordered structure, NiO(001) and Ni(011) surfaces, paramagnetic molecule NO, and nonparamagnetic molecule CO. The calculations showed that the dependence of surface energies on magnetism was modest, ranging from 49 to 54 meV/\u00c52 for NiO(001) and from 162 to 172 meV/\u00c52 for NiO(011). On NiO(001), both molecules preferred the top site of the Ni cation exclusively for all NiO magnetic structures considered, and calculated adsorption energies ranged from \u20130.33 to \u20130.37 eV for CO and from \u20130.42 to \u20130.46 eV for NO. On NiO(011), both molecules preferred the bridge site of two Ni cations irrespective of the NiO magnetism. It was found that rather than the long-range magnetism of bulk NiO, the local magnetic order of two coordinated Ni cations binding to the adsorbed molecule had a pronounced influence on adsorption. The calculated NO adsorption energy at the (\u2191\u2193) bridge sites ranged from \u20130.99 to \u20131.05 eV, and become stronger at the (\u2191\u2191) bridge sites with values of \u20131.21 to \u20131.30 eV.

It was found that the crystalline WO3 in the 1.6WO3/CeO2 sample could be removed in 25 wt% ammonium hydroxide at 70 \u00b0C, which improved the catalytic activity of the sample. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hydrogen (H2) temperature programmed reduction, NH3 temperature programmed desorption, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The results revealed that the dispersed WO3 promoted the catalytic activity of WO3/CeO2 while the crystalline WO3 inhibited catalytic activity. The oxygen activation of CeO2 was inhibited by the coverage of WO3, which weakened NO oxidation and adsorption of nitrate species over WO3/CeO2. In addition, the NH3 adsorption performance on CeO2 was improved by modification with WO3. NH3 was the most stable adsorbed species under NH3 SCR reaction conditions. In situ DRIFT spectra suggested that the NH3 SCR reaction proceeded via the Eley-Rideal mechanism over WO3/CeO2. Thus, when the loading of WO3 was close to the dispersion capacity, the effects of NH3 adsorption and activation were maximized to promote the reaction via the Eley-Rideal route.",

We applied Al2O3-supported manganese oxide (MnOx) catalysts to this process, and examined the HCHO adsorption capacity and OZCO performance over the MnOx catalysts. Owing to the high dispersion of MnOx and low oxidation state of manganese, the MnOx/Al2O3 catalysts with a manganese acetate precursor and 10%-Mn loading showed good performance in both storage and OZCO stages. The presence of H2O led to a decrease of the HCHO adsorption capacity owing to competitive adsorption between moisture and HCHO at the storage stage; however, high relative humidity (RH) favored complete conversion of stored HCHO to CO2 at the OZCO stage and contributed to an excellent carbon balance. Four low concentration HCHO storage-OZCO cycles with a long HCHO storage period and relatively short OZCO period were successfully performed over the selected MnOx/Al2O3 catalyst at room temperature and a RH of 50%, demonstrating that the proposed storage-OZCO process is an economical, reliable, and promising technique for indoor air purification.",

The concept of SAC has also been successfully extended to other FeOx supported transition metal systems both experimentally and theoretically. However, the FeOx substrate itself (denoted by Fe1/FeOx following the same nomenclature of Pt1/FeOx) as a typical transition metal oxide possesses a very low catalytic activity toward CO oxidation, although it can be viewed as Fe1/FeOx SAC. Here, to understand the catalytic mechanism of FeOx-based SACs for CO oxidation, we have performed density functional theory calculations on Pt1/FeOx and Fe1/FeOx for CO oxidation to address the differences between these two SACs in terms of the catalytic mechanism of CO oxidation and the chemical behavior of the catalysts. Our calculation results indicated that the catalytic cycle of Fe1/FeOx is much more difficult to accomplish than that of SAC Pt1/FeOx because of a high activation barrier (1.09 eV) for regeneration of the oxygen vacancy formed when the second CO2 molecule desorbs from the surface. Moreover, density of states and Bader charge analysis revealed differences in the catalytic performance for CO oxidation by the SACs Fe1/FeOx and Pt1/FeOx. This work provides insights into the fundamental interactions between the single-atom Pt1 and FeOx substrate, and the exceptional catalytic performance of this system for CO oxidation.",

Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy for CO chemisorption measurements illustrate that FeOx preferentially nucleates on Pd (111) facets and divides the Pd surface atoms into small ensembles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed that the Pd became electron deficient after FeOx deposition owing to the strong Pd\u2013FeOx interaction.

The pretreated samples were investigated by N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance. The pretreatment atmosphere greatly influences the status of the Ag and O species, which in turn significantly impacts the adsorption and catalytic removal of toluene. Ag2O and amorphous Ag particles, as well as a large amount of subsurface oxygen species, are formed on O500, and the subsurface oxygen enhances the interaction between Ag species and toluene, so O500 shows good activity at higher temperature. However, its activity at lower temperature is not as high as expected, with a reduced presence of Ag2O and lower adsorption capacity for toluene. H2 pretreatment at 500 \u00b0C is conducive to the formation of large Ag particles and yields the largest adsorption capacity for toluene, so H500 exhibits the best activity at lower temperatures; however, because of poor interaction between Ag and toluene, its activity at higher temperature is modest.

In particular, we established the chemical potential of the OH\u2212 and hole pair and included the OH\u2212 anion in the reaction pathway, accounting to the alkaline conditions of anodic OER process. We then analyzed the OER pathways on the surface with OH-, O- and Fe-terminations. On the surface with OH- and O- terminations, the O2 molecule could form from either OH reacting with the surface oxygen species (\u2013OH* and \u2013O*) or the combination of two surface oxygen species. On the Fe-terminated surface, O2 can only form by adsorbing OH on the Fe sites first. The potential-limiting step of the oxygen evolution with different surface terminations was determined by following the free-energy change of the elementary steps along each pathway.

Unfortunately, the hydrogen production efficiency of single phase photocatalysts is too low to meet the practical requirements. The construction of heterostructured photocatalyst systems, which are comprised of multiple components or multiple phases, is an efficient method to facilitate the separation of electron-hole pairs to minimize the energy-waste, provide more electrons, enhance their redox ability, and hence improve the photocatalytic activity.

All the synthesized samples were characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, 27Al MAS NMR, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, pyridine-FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, HRTEM, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to analyze their physicochemical properties and to gain a deeper insight of the interrelationship between the structures and the catalytic performance. The synthesis mechanism was proposed to involve the formation of Br\u00f6nsted acid and Lewis acid sites through the replacement of Si4+ with Al3+. Aluminum introduced into MCFs by the post synthetic method has a negligible influence on the mesostructure of the parent MCFs but can form silicoaluminate materials with moderate Br\u00f6nsted acidity. For Al-MCFs(x) materials, the detection of tetrahedrally coordinated Al3+ cations demonstrated that the Al species had been successfully incorporated into the silicon frameworks. Furthermore, the DBT hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalytic activity of the NiMo/Al-MCFs(x) catalysts increased with increasing Si/Al molar ratio, and reached a maximum at a Si/Al molar ratio of 20. The interaction of Ni and Mo species with the support became stronger when Al was incorporated into the MCFs supports. The high activities of the NiMo/Al-MCFs catalysts for the DBT HDS were attributed to the suitable acidity properties and good dispersions of the Ni and Mo active phases.",

After characterization, the MOF was used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for degradation of the refractory pollutant rhodamine B (RhB) in water. The composite prepared at a 0.5:1 mass ratio of Mn3O4 to ZIF-8 possessed the highest catalytic activity with negligible Mn leaching. The maximum RhB degradation of approximately 98% was achieved at 0.4 g/L 0.5-Mn/ZIF-120, 0.3 g/L PMS, and 10 mg/L initial RhB concentration at a reaction temperature of 23 \u00b0C. The RhB degradation followed first-order kinetics and was accelerated with increased 0.5-Mn/ZIF-120 and PMS dosages, decreased initial RhB concentration, and increased reaction temperature. Moreover, quenching tests indicated that \u2022OH was the predominant radical involved in the RhB degradation; the \u2022OH mainly originated from SO4\u2212\u2022 and, hence, PMS. Mn3O4/ZIF-8 also displayed good reusability for RhB degradation in the presence of PMS over five runs, with a RhB degradation efficiency of more than 96% and Mn leaching of less than 5% for each run. Based on these findings, a RhB degradation mechanism was proposed.",

     "abstract": "From both fundamental and practical perspectives, the production of chemicals from biomass resources using high-efficiency non-precious metal catalysts is important. However, many processes require addition of stoichiometric or excess quantities of base, which leads to high energy consumption, leaching problems, and side reactions. In this study, we investigated the high-efficiency oxidative esterification of furfural to methylfuroate by molecular oxygen with a Co-N-C/MgO catalyst. The catalyst was prepared by direct pyrolysis of a cobalt(II) phenanthroline complex on MgO at 800 \u00b0C under N2 atmosphere. From furfural, 93.0% conversion and 98.5% selectivity toward methylfuroate were achieved under 0.5 MPa O2 with reaction at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h without a basic additive. The conversion and selectivity were much higher than those obtained with cobalt catalysts produced by pyrolysis of a cobalt(II) phenanthroline complex on activated carbon or typical basic supports, including NaX, NaY, and CaO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and experimental results revealed that the high efficiency of Co-N-C/MgO for production of methylfuroate was closely related to the cobalt-nitrogen-doped carbon species and its catalytic ability in hydrogen abstraction. In contrast, Co-N-C(HCl) that synthesized by removing MgO with HCl from Co-N-C/MgO, as the catalyst produced mainly an acetal as a condensation product, and chloride ions had a negative effect on the oxidative esterification. Although the catalytic performance of the cobalt-nitrogen-doped carbon species was greatly affected by HCl treatment, it could be recovered to a great extent by addition of MgO. Moreover, changes in the oxygen pressure hardly affected the oxidative esterification of furfural with Co-N-C/MgO. This study not only provides an effective approach to prepare methylfuroate, but also for designing high-performance non-precious metal catalysts for the oxidative esterification of biomass-derived compounds.",

Decomposition of 2-PAP can follow two different mechanisms: an active hydrogen transfer mechanism or an oxonium cation mechanism.

The catalysts of POMs perform the following functions: promoting active hydrogen liberated from ethanol and causing formation of and then temporarily stabilizing oxonium cations from 2-PAP. The use of Cs-PMo, which with strong redox ability, enhances hydrogen liberation and promotes liberated hydrogen transfer to the reaction intermediates.

It is important to analyze the outermost surface composition of the supported alloy nanoparticles to understand the nature of the catalytically active sites. In this paper, homogeneous face-centered cubic PtCu nanoparticles with a narrow particle size distribution were successfully fabricated and dispersed on a high-surface-area TiO2 powder support. The samples were oxidized and reduced in situ and then introduced into the ultrahigh vacuum chamber to measure the topmost surface composition by high-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy, and to determine the oxidation states of the elements by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface composition and morphology, elemental distribution, and oxidation states of the components were found to be significantly affected by the support and treatment conditions. The PtCu is de-alloyed upon oxidation with CuO wetting on the TiO2 surface and re-alloyed upon reduction. Phase diagrams of the surface composition and the bulk composition were plotted and compared for the supported and unsupported materials.",

The bifunctionality closely depends on the distance between the metal and acid sites. However, the metal\u2013acid proximity effect has rarely investigated in biomass conversions. In this work, we precisely deposited a porous Al2O3 overcoat onto a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst using atomic layer deposition to improve the proximity between the Pt metal and the alumina acid sites by increasing the area of the metal\u2013acid interface. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of pyridine chemisorption confirmed that the overall catalyst acidity did not change considerably after applying the alumina overcoat. In the aqueous-phase, hydrogenolysis of glycerol was used to demonstrate that the alumina overcoat significantly improved the activity approximately 2.8-fold, as well as the selectivity to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD) at high conversions. DRIFTS measurements of CO chemisorption indicated that the Pt-alumina interface had greater area for alumina coated Pt/Al2O3 than for the uncoated analog. Moreover, we used the hydrogenation of acetol, the key reaction intermediate in glycerol hydrogenolysis, as a control experiment to confirm that the observed activity improvement in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol could be attributed to the enhancement of the dehydration reaction step, which requires acidic function. In brief, our work provides solid evidence that close metal\u2013acid proximity enhances bifunctionality, thus improving the catalytic activity.",

Here, a N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon with a high N content (9.58 wt%), high surface area (417 m2/g), and three-dimensional cubic structure was synthesized successfully and used as an effective support for immobilizing Pt nanoparticles (NPs). The positive effects of nitrogen on the metal particle size enabled ultrasmall Pt NPs (about 1.0 \u00b1 0.5 nm) to be obtained. Moreover, most of the Pt NPs are homogeneously dispersed in the mesoporous channels. However, using the ordered mesoporous carbon without nitrogen as support, the particles were larger (4.4 \u00b1 1.7 nm) and many Pt NPs were distributed on the external surface, demonstrating the important role of the nitrogen species. The obtained N-doped ordered mesoporous material supported catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity (conversion 100%) and selectivity (>99%) in the hydrogenation of halogenated nitrobenzenes under mild conditions. These values are much higher than those achieved using a commercial Pt/C catalyst (conversion 89% and selectivity 90%). This outstanding catalytic performance can be attributed to the synergetic effects of the mesoporous structure, N-functionalized support, and stabilized ultrasmall Pt NPs. Moreover, such supported catalyst also showed excellent catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of other halogenated nitrobenzenes and nitroarenes. In addition, the stability of the multifunctional catalyst was excellent and it could be reused more than 10 times without significant losses of activity and selectivity. Our results conclusively show that a N-doped carbon support enable the formation of ultrafine metal NPs and improve the reaction activity and selectivity.",

Catalysts were introduced to enhance the N2O5 formation rate with less ozone injection and leakage. A series of monometallic catalysts (manganese, cobalt, cerium, iron, copper, and chromium) as prepared by the sol-gel method were tested. The manganese oxides achieved an almost 80% conversion efficiency at an ozone (O3)/NO molar ratio of 2.0 in 0.12 s. The crystalline structure and porous parameters were determined. The thermodynamic reaction threshold of NO conversion to N2O5 is oxidation with an O3/NO molar ratio of 1.5. Spherical alumina was selected as the support to achieve the threshold, which was believed to improve the catalytic activity by increasing the surface area and the gas-solid contact time. Based on the manganese oxides, cerium, iron, chromium, copper, and cobalt were introduced as promoters. Cerium and iron improved the deep-oxidation efficiency compared with manganese/spherical alumina, with less than 50 mg/m3 of outlet NO + nitrogen oxide, and less than 25 mg/m3 of residual ozone at an O3/NO molar ratio of 1.5. The other three metal oxides inhibited catalytic activity.

Here, we report Co3O4 nanoparticles assembled on a polypyrrole/graphene oxide electrocatalyst (Co3O4/Ppy/GO) as an efficient catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. The catalyst was prepared via the hydrothermal reaction of Co2+ ions with Ppy-modified GO. The GO, Ppy/GO, and Co3O4/Ppy/GO were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The incorporation of Ppy into GO nanosheets resulted in the formation of a nitrogen-modified GO porous structure, which acted as an efficient electron-transport network for the ORR. With further anchoring of Co3O4 on Ppy/GO, the as-prepared Co3O4/Ppy/GO exhibited excellent ORR activity and followed a four-electron route mechanism for the ORR in alkaline solution. An onset potential of \u22120.10 V vs. a saturated calomel electrode and a diffusion limiting current density of 2.30 mA/cm2 were achieved for the Co3O4/Ppy/GO catalyst heated at 800 \u00b0C; these values are comparable to those for noble-metal-based Pt/C catalysts.

Transition metals can fabricate molecular electrocatalysts with N4-macrocycles such as porphyrin-class compounds and the so-formed M\u2013N\u2013C active centre plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performances towards the ORR. Group-IV and -V Transition metal oxides represent another class of promising alternative of Pt-based catalysts for the ORR which catalytic activity largely depends on the surface structure and the introduction of surface defects. Recent advances in synthesis of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) allow for precise control over particle sizes and shapes and the crystalline facets exposed to enhance the ORR performance of electrocatalysts. Two-dimensional materials such as functionalized grapheme or MoS2 are emerging as novel electrocatalysts for the ORR.

Some novel electrocatalysts even surpass commercial Pt/C systems, demonstrating their potential to be alternatives in industrial applications.

Traditionally, it has been accepted that a material with high crystallinity is important to serve as a good catalyst for HER and/or OER. Recently, catalysts for HER and/or OER in the electrolysis of water splitting based on amorphous materials have received much interest in the scientific community owing to the abundant unsaturated active sites on the amorphous surface, which form catalytic centers for the reaction of the electrolysis of water.

The reduction conditions of the Pt-containing precursor were firstly optimized, and the influence of the Pt loading amount on the ORR was investigated as well. The results show that the obtained D-AC@5.0%Pt sample (contains 5 wt% Pt) has surpassed the commercial Pt/C with 20 wt% Pt for the ORR in an alkaline solution. In the meantime, it is more stable than the commercial Pt/C. The outstanding ORR performance of the D-AC@5.0%Pt confirms that both the unique defects in the D-AC and the introduced Pt particles are indispensable to the ORR.

When Na2MoO4 was added to the reaction, polymolybdate could be anchored into the carbon materials via a chemical interaction that helps polymolybdate disperse uniformly into the SNC. After a high temperature treatment, polymolybdate transformed into MoS2 at 800 \u00b0C for 6 h in a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min, owing to S2\u2013 being released from the SNC during the treatment (denoted as MoS2/SNC-800-6h).

The interface contact in the fabricated nanocomposite greatly influences the charge transfer and separation so as to determine the final photocatalytic activities. However, the role of interface contact is often neglected, and is rarely reported to date. Hence, it is possible to further enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4-based nanocomposite by improving the interfacial connection. Herein, phosphate\u2013oxygen (P\u2013O) bridged TiO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were successfully synthesized using a simple wet chemical method, and the effects of the P\u2013O functional bridges on the photogenerated charge separation and photocatalytic activity for pollutant degradation and CO2 reduction were investigated. The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 was greatly improved upon coupling with an appropriate amount of nanocrystalline TiO2, especially with P\u2013O bridged TiO2. Atmosphere-controlled steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy analyses revealed clearly the enhancement of photogenerated charge separation of g-C3N4 upon coupling with the P\u2013O bridged TiO2, resulting from the built P\u2013O bridges between TiO2 and g-C3N4 so as to promote effective transfer of excited electrons from g-C3N4 to TiO2. This enhancement was responsible for the improved photoactivity of the P\u2013O bridged TiO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, which exhibited three-time photocatalytic activity enhancement for 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation and CO2 reduction compared with bare g-C3N4. Furthermore, radical-trapping experiments revealed that the OH species formed as hole-modulated direct intermediates dominated the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol.

In the present study, the perovskite series La1-xCaxMn1-yAlyO3 (x, y = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, or 0.8) was fabricated using a modified Pechini method and comprehensively investigated to determine the applicability of these materials to solar H2 production via two-step thermochemical water splitting. The thermochemical redox behaviors of these perovskites were optimized by doping at either the A (Ca) or B (Al) sites over a broad range of substitution values, from 0.2 to 0.8. Through this doping, a highly efficient perovskite (La0.6Ca0.4Mn0.6Al0.4O3) was developed, which yielded a remarkable H2 production rate of 429 \u03bcmol/g during two-step thermochemical H2O splitting, going between 1400 and 1000 \u00b0C. Moreover, the performance of the optimized perovskite was found to be eight times higher than that of the benchmark catalyst CeO2 under the same experimental conditions. Furthermore, these perovskites also showed impressive catalytic stability during two-step thermochemical cycling tests. These newly developed La1-xCaxMn1-yAlyO3 redox catalysts appear to have great potential for future practical applications in thermochemical solar fuel production.",

The effect of doping on the magnetic properties of some photocatalysts that are easily recycled was studied using the local spin density approximation (LSDA)+U method on typical divalent metal oxide semiconductors CuO, NiO, Ni-doped CuO, and Cu-doped NiO. It is found that the influence of Ni doping on the spatial structure of CuO and that of Cu doping on the spatial structure of NiO are negligible because of the similar radii of Ni2+ and Cu2+. The valence band and conduction band for Ni-doped CuO are clearly spin-split, corresponding to a net effective magnetic moment of \u00b5eff = 1.66 \u00b5B. This may improve the photocatalytic efficiency and raise the recycle rate of photocatalysts. In the Cu-doped NiO system, the presence of Cu 3d states near to the Fermi level increases the width of the valence band and narrows the band gap with respect to that in pure NiO. Beyond the Cu 3d states, within the band gap, appear two energy levels around the Fermi level, which may effectively separate the electron-hole pair and also lead to enhanced absorption of visible light and infrared light. It can be concluded that the observed changes in the band structure may be helpful for improving the activity of photocatalysts and the doped systems have net magnetic moments, meaning that they are easily recycled and can be reused.",

It was noted that the toluene removal efficiency was 32.5% at the specific input energy of 160 J/L when non-thermal plasma was used alone. The \u03b1-MnO2 catalyst showed the best activity among the investigated catalysts, yielding a toluene conversion of 78.1% at the specific input energy of 160 J/L.

Additionally, the degradation routes of toluene in non-thermal plasma and in the plasma-catalytic process were also studied. It was concluded that the introduction of MnO2 catalysts enabled O3, O2, electrons and radical species in the gas to be adsorbed on the MnO2 surface via a facile interconversion among the Mn4+, Mn3+ and Mn2+ states. These four species could then be transported to the toluene or intermediate organic by-products, which greatly improved the toluene removal efficiency and decreased the final output of by-products.",

We carried out first-principles calculations at the PBE+U level to investigate the Pd-doping effect on CH4 reactivity over the Co3O4 catalyst. Because of the structural complexity of the Pd-doped Co3O4 catalyst, we built Pd-doped catalyst models using Co3O4(001) slabs with two different terminations and examined CH4 reactivity over the possible Pd\u2013O active sites. A low energy barrier of 0.68 eV was predicted for CH4 dissociation over the more reactive Pd-doped Co3O4(001) surface, which was much lower than the 0.98 and 0.89 eV that was predicted previously over the more reactive pure Co3O4(001) and (011) surfaces, respectively. Using a simple model, we predicted CH4 reaction rates over the pure Co3O4(001) and (011) surfaces, and Co3O4(001) surfaces with different amounts of Pd dopant. Our theoretical results agree well with the available experimental data, which suggests a strong synergy between the Pd dopant and the Co3O4 catalyst, and leads to a significant increase in CH4 reaction rate.",

     "abstract": "Among multitudinous metal-oxide catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3-SCR), Mn-based catalysts have become very popular and developed rapidly in recent years because of its superior low-temperature denitrification activity, mainly originating from multi-valence of Mn. Most studies suggest that the catalytic activity of multi-component oxides is superior to that of single-component catalysts owing to the synergistic effect among the metallic elements in such materials, of which more attentions have been given to Ce as an additive owing to its powerful oxygen storage capacity, redox ability and its ready availability. As the core of SCR technology, the research points in catalyst development at the present stage of all researchers in countries mainly centralize on the optimization of active components, carriers, calcination temperature, calcination time and temperature-raising procedure, giving little thought to the effects of the calcination atmosphere. In the present work, Ce-modified Mn-based catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method. The effects of the calcination atmosphere (N2, air or O2) on the performance of the resulting materials during NH3-SCR and its causes of the differences were subsequently investigated and characterized using various analytical methods. Data obtained from X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry and temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen show that calcination under N2 reduces both the degree of oxidation and crystallization of the MnOx. Scanning electron microscopy also demonstrates that the use of N2 inhibits the growth of grains and increases the dispersion of the catalysts. In addition, the results of temperature-programmed desorption with ammonia indicate that catalysts calcined under N2 exhibit a greater quantity of acid sites. Finally, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry and activity results demonstrate that MnOx in the lower valence states is more favorable for NH3-SCR reactions. In conclusion, catalysts calcined under N2 show superior performance during NH3-SCR for NOx removal, allowing NO conversions up to 94% at 473 K.",

     "abstract": "Density-functional theory calculations were carried out to study the strontium (Sr)-doping effect on methane activation over a lanthanum-oxide (La2O3) catalyst for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) using the cluster model. Eight Sr-doped La2O3 cluster models were built from pure La2O3 clusters that were used previously to model the La2O3 catalyst. These form two distinct categories, namely, those without a radical character (LaSrO2(OH), La2SrO4, La3SrO5(OH), and La5SrO8(OH)) and those with a radical character (LaSrO3, La2SrO4(OH), La3SrO6, and La5SrO9). The potential-energy surface for CH4 activation to form a CH3 radical at different Sr\u2013O and La\u2013O pair sites on these Sr-doped La2O3 clusters was calculated to study the Sr-doping effect on the OCM catalytic activity. CH4 physisorption and chemisorption energies, and activation barriers, and CH3 desorption energies were predicted. Compared with the pure La2O3 clusters, in general, the Sr-doped La2O3 clusters are thermodynamically and kinetically more reactive with CH4. For the Sr-doped La2O3 clusters without the radical character, the Sr\u2013O pair site is more reactive with CH4 than the La\u2013O pair site, although a direct release of the CH3 radical is also highly endothermic as in the case of the pure La2O3 clusters. In contrast, for the Sr-doped La2O3 clusters with a radical character, the activation of CH4 at the oxygen radical site and the release of the CH3 radical are much easier. Thus, our calculations suggest that the Sr dopant prompts the OCM catalytic activity of the La2O3 catalyst by providing a highly active oxygen-radical site and by strengthening the basicity of the M\u2013O pair site, which leads to lower CH4 activation energies and lower CH3 desorption energies.",

These results show that the texture and acid density of Cu-SAPO-34 can be better preserved by increasing the Cu loading, although the hydrolysis of Si\u2013O\u2013Al bonds is inevitable. The stability of Cu ions and the stability of the SAPO framework were positively correlated at relatively low Cu loadings. However, a high Cu loading (e.g., 3.67 wt%) resulted in a significant decrease in the number of isolated Cu ions. Aggregation of CuO particles also occurred during the LTST, which accounts for the decreasing NH3 oxidation activities of the catalysts. Among the catalysts, Cu-SAPO-34 with a high Si content and medium Cu content (1.37 wt%) showed the lowest decrease in NH3-SCR because its Cu2+ content was well retained and its acid density was well preserved.",

The electrocatalytic performance of the resulting Pd/Gr-C catalysts during the electrooxidation of formic acid was assessed. A Pd/Gr0.3C0.7 (Gr oxide:C = 3:7, based on the precursor mass ratio) electrocatalyst exhibited better catalytic performance than both Pd/C and Pd/Gr catalysts. The current density generated by the Pd/Gr0.3C0.7 catalyst was as high as 102.14 mA mgPd\u22121, a value that is approximately 3 times that obtained from the Pd/C (34.40 mA mgPd\u22121) and 2.6 times that of the Pd/Gr material (38.50 mA mgPd\u22121). The anodic peak potential of the Pd/Gr0.3C0.7 was 120 mV more negative than that of the Pd/C and 70 mV more negative than that of the Pd/Gr. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated that the spherical C particles accumulated on the wrinkled graphene surfaces to form C cluster/Gr hybrids having three-dimensional nanostructures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data confirmed the interaction between the Pd metal and the binary Gr-C support. The Pd/Gr0.3C0.7 also exhibited high stability, and so is a promising candidate for the fabrication of anodes for direct formic acid fuel cells. This work demonstrates a simple and cost-effective method for improving the performance of Pd-based electrocatalysts, which should have potential industrial applications.",

     "abstract": "Selective oxidation with molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant under mild conditions is of crucial importance for the long-term sustainable exploitation of available feedstocks and the formation of required intermediates for organic synthesis and industrial processes. Among the developed oxidation protocols, innovative strategies using hydroxyimide organocatalysts in combination with metallic or metal-free cocatalysts have attracted much attention because of the good activities and selectivities of such catalysts in the oxo functionalization of hydrocarbons. This method is based on the reaction using N-hydroxyphthalimide, which was first reported by Ishii's group in the 1990s. Although the important and wide-ranging applications of such catalysts have been summarized recently, there are no reviews that focus solely on oxidation strategies using multi-nitroxy organocatalysts, which have interesting properties and high reactivities. This review covers the concise synthetic methods and mechanistic profiles of known multi-nitroxy organocatalysts and summarizes significant advances in their use in efficient aerobic oxidation. Based on a combination of experimental and theoretical results, guidelines for the future rational design of multi-nitroxy organocatalysts are proposed, and the properties of various model multi-nitroxy organocatalysts are predicted. The present overview of the advantages, limitations, and potential applications of multi-nitroxy organocatalysts can provide useful tools for researchers in the field of selective oxidation.",

All the results indicate that Cu is present on the SiC support primarily as Cu2O. The SEM and TEM results show that cubic Cu2O nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the \u03b2-SiC surface. The reaction conditions, namely the temperature, reaction time, and amounts of base and catalyst used, for the Ullmann-type C\u2013O cross-coupling reaction were optimized.

The activity and selectivity of the H-ZSM-5 catalyst in the MTA reaction has been studied as a function of crystal size. ZSM-5 zeolites with different crystal sizes were successfully synthesized by conventional hydrothermal methods. Tailoring ZSM-5 particle size was easily controlled by changes to the sol-gel composition, and in particular, the deionized water to tetrapropylammonium hydroxide ratio, and crystallization time. The structure of the H-ZSM-5 zeolites were characterized by X-ray diffraction and the morphology of the zeolite particles was determined by scanning electron microscopy. N2 adsorption-desorption measurements established changes to the textural properties, and compositional properties were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Acidity measurements of the catalysts were measured by pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia. After subjecting the catalysts to the MTA reaction, the total amount of coke formed on the spent deactivated catalysts was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis. The results show that the SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios and acidic properties of the H-ZSM-5 samples are similar, however, the nano-sized hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite with an additional level of auxiliary pores possesses a higher surface area, larger mesopore volume and larger macropore volume, resulting in more effective mass transportation properties. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts were evaluated for their activity towards the MTA reaction as a function of crystal size. The nano-sized H-ZSM-5 catalyst having shorter diffusion path lengths, substantial mesoporosity and a high external surface area showed excellent selectivity toward aromatics (average > 42%) and benzene, toluene and xylenes (37% at 180 min). Furthermore, lower coking levels were observed on the nano-sized H-ZSM-5 catalyst when compared with the H-ZSM-5 catalysts possessing larger particle sizes and is attributed to a reduction in polyaromatic hydrocarbons being deposited within the internal surface area.",

The structures of the fresh and used catalysts were studied using X-ray diffraction, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed reduction by H2, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, and CHNS analysis. The structures were correlated with the catalytic activities. The Cu-Co/CeO2 catalyst produced mainly 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan via reduction of C=O bonds on large Cu particles. The Cu-Co/Al2O3 catalyst gave the best selectivity for DMF, as a result of a combination of highly dispersed Cu, mixed copper\u2013cobalt oxides, and suitable weak acidic sites. Cu-Co/ZrO2 had low selectivity for DMF and produced a combination of various over-hydrogenolysis products, including 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran and 5,5-oxybis(methylene)-bis(2-methylfuran), because of the presence of strong acidic sites.

Here, we report the high efficiency of bifunctional metallosalen complexes bearing quaternary phosphonium salts in catalyzing both of these reactions under solvent-free, mild conditions without the need for co-catalysts. The catalysts' bifunctionality is attributed to an intramolecular cooperative process between the metal center and the halogen anion.

A highly active ceria promoted Pt catalyst (4%Pt-12%CeO2/SiO2; conversion \u2265 99% at low (< 500 ppm) and high (> 2500 ppm) CO concentrations was developed for CO oxidation at ambient temperature in humid air.

The activity was correlated with surface properties using CO/H2 chemisorption, O2-H2 titration, X-ray diffraction and BET surface area analysis. The method of CeO2 deposition had a significant impact on the catalytic activity. CeO2 deposition by impregnation resulted in a catalyst that was three times more active than that prepared by deposition precipitation or CeO2 grafting. O2-H2 titration results revealed that the close association of ceria and Pt in the case of CeO2 deposition by impregnation resulted in higher activity. The catalyst support used was also crucial as a silica supported catalyst was five times more active than an alumina supported catalyst. The particle size and pore structure of the catalyst support were also crucial as the reaction was diffusion controlled. The drying and calcination conditions of the ceria and Pt precursors also played a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity.

The richly porous microstructure endowed the as-prepared porous g-C3N4 with an excellent photocatalytic activity.

It has been shown that SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability. Dibenzothiophene poisoning experiments were performed to investigate the detailed structures of the two supported catalysts. The characterization of the two catalysts indicates that the distribution of Pt on the porous support affects the activity. In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition. This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite. In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination. In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.",

Simple adjustments to the type of organic template and reaction temperature enable the successful synthesis of FDU-12 with controllable entrance sizes (< 3, 3\u20135 and 7 nm). Excellent anti-sintering properties are observed for FDU-12 with a sub-5-nm entrance size (3\u20135 nm) over a wide loading concentration (1.0\u20138.3 wt%) and the AuNPs can be stabilized within a 4.5\u20135.0-nm range after calcination at 550 \u00b0C in air for 5 h.

The results show that the presence of Fe2O3 in the electrocatalysts can promote the kinetic processes of MOR on Pt, and this promoting effect is related to the morphology of the Fe2O3 promoter. The catalyst with Fe2O3 nanorods as the promoter (Pt-Fe2O3/C-R) exhibits much higher catalytic activity and stability than that with Fe2O3 nanoplates as the promoter (Pt-Fe2O3/C-P).

Surface silver oxides generated under the O2 atmosphere favor soot combustion by participating in the redox cycles between soot and the silver oxide, whereas the AgNO3 that forms in a NOx-rich atmosphere facilitates soot abatement at a lower temperature.

The possible degradation pathways were explored through analysis of the reaction intermediates by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that the presence of Ag0 enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency of Ag/Ag2O-BiVO4 via a synergetic effect between Ag2O and Ag0 at the p-n heterojunction. Moreover, the presence of Ag0 also greatly promoted the adsorption of MC-RR on the photocatalyst surface. Toxicological experiments on mice showed that the toxicity of MC-RR was significantly reduced after photocatalytic degradation.",

The enhanced visible light absorption and charge carrier separation can be simultaneously realized after the introduction of BiOI particles into La(OH)3 nanorods. The BiOI@La(OH)3 composites were applied for visible light photocatalytic oxidization of NO in air and exhibited an enhanced activity compared with BiOI and pure La(OH)3 nanorods. The results show that the energy levels between the La(OH)3 and BiOI phases matched well with each other, thus forming a heterojunctioned BiOI@La(OH)3 structure. This band structure matching could promote the separation and transfer of photoinduced electron-hole pairs at the interface, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic performance of BiOI@La(OH)3 is shown to be dependent on the mass ratio of BiOI to La(OH)3. The highest photocatalytic performance can be achieved when the mass ratio of BiOI to La(OH)3 is controlled at 1.5. A further increase of the mass ratio of BiOI weakened the redox abilities of the photogenerated charge carriers. A new photocatalytic mechanism for BiOI@La(OH)3 heterostructures is proposed, which is directly related to the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers by the heterojunction. Importantly, the as-prepared BiOI@La(OH)3 heterostructures exhibited a high photochemical stability after multiple reaction runs. Our findings demonstrate that BiOI is an effective component for the formation of a heterostructure with the properties of a wide bandgap semiconductor, which is of great importance for extending the light absorption and photocatalytic activity of wide bandgap semiconductors into visible light region.",

     "abstract": "Magnetic Cu0/Fe3O4 submicron composites were prepared using a hydrothermal method and used as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the degradation of organic pollutants. The as-prepared magnetic Cu0/Fe3O4 submicron composites were composed of Cu0 and Fe3O4 crystals and had an average size of approximately 220 nm. The Cu0/Fe3O4 composites could efficiently catalyze the activation of PMS to generate singlet oxygen, and thus induced the rapid degradation of rhodamine B, methylene blue, orange II, phenol and 4-chlorophenol. The use of 0.1 g/L of the Cu0/Fe3O4 composites induced the complete removal of rhodamine B (20 \u03bcmol/L) in 15 min, methylene blue (20 \u03bcmol/L) in 5 min, orange II (20 \u03bcmol/L) in 10 min, phenol (0.1 mmol/L) in 30 min and 4-chlorophenol (0.1 mmol/L) in 15 min with an initial pH value of 7.0 and a PMS concentration of 0.5 mmol/L. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal higher than 85% for all of these five pollutants was obtained in 30 min when the PMS concentration was 2.5 mmol/L. The rate of degradation was considerably higher than that obtained with Cu0 or Fe3O4 particles alone. The enhanced catalytic activity of the Cu0/Fe3O4 composites in the activation of PMS was attributed to the synergistic effect of the Cu0 and Fe3O4 crystals in the composites. Singlet oxygen was identified as the primary reactive oxygen species responsible for pollutant degradation by electron spin resonance and radical quenching experiments. A possible mechanism for the activation of PMS by Cu0/Fe3O4 composites is proposed as electron transfer from the organic pollutants to PMS induces the activation of PMS to generate 1O2, which induces the degradation of the organic pollutants. As a magnetic catalyst, the Cu0/Fe3O4 composites were easily recovered by magnetic separation, and exhibited excellent stability over five successive degradation cycles. The present study provides a facile and green heterogeneous catalysis method for the oxidative removal of organic pollutants.",

Characterization by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction indicated that the amount and size of the WO3\u2013x QDs could be tuned by modulating the addition of the W precursor. Evidence from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy suggested that the hydrogen reduction of the composite induced the formation of oxygen vacancy (W5+/VO) defects in WO3. These defects led to ohmic contact between WO3-x and TiO2, which altered the charge-transfer pathway from type II heterojunction to Z-scheme, and maintained the highly reductive and oxidative ability of TiO2 and WO3\u2013x, respectively.

The as prepared silver/silver molybdate (Ag/Ag2MoO4) composites were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance absorption spectroscopy (DRS) in order to investigate their crystal structure, morphology and optical property as well. The photocatalytic activities of the composites were subsequently evaluated by their ability to degrade rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation. Varies of controlled experiments were then carefully operated to gain a deep insight into the assembling of Ag/Ag2MoO4 composites. It was found that preparation conditions such as pH, reaction time, and the amount of surfactant played important roles in the formation of composites with octahedral microstructures. And the composite obtained at 160 \u00b0C using 0.5 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance under visible-light irradiation. Capture experiments were also conducted to clarify the function of different active species generated on the surface of Ag/Ag2MoO4 during the photocatalytic process, in which both holes and \u2022OH radicals were found to play crucial role in photocatalytic removal of RhB under visible light irradiation. A possible photocatalytic mechanism of Ag/Ag2MoO4 was finally proposed on the basis of all the results to explain the higher photocatalytic activity of the octahedral Ag/Ag2MoO4 composites. It was inferred that the photoinduced \u201chot\u201d electrons can quickly transfer from the Ag NPs to the conduction band of Ag2MoO4 and react with oxygen and H2O to generate a large quality of active radicals such as \u2022OH and \u2022O2\u2212 because of the SPR effects. Besides, this SPR effects of Ag nanoparticles deposited on the surface of Ag2MoO4 can not only dramatically amplify its light absorption, especially in the visible region, but also promote the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs and effectively decrease electron-hole recombination.",

However, the synthesis of the NiS2 cocatalyst usually requires harsh conditions, which risks destroying the microstructures of the g-C3N4 photocatalysts. In this study, a facile and low-temperature (80 \u00b0C) impregnation method was developed to prepare NiS2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts. First, the g-C3N4 powders were processed by the hydrothermal method in order to introduce oxygen-containing functional groups (such as \u2013OH and \u2013CONH\u2013) to the surface of g-C3N4. Then, the Ni2+ ions could be adsorbed near the g-C3N4 via strong electrostatic interaction between g-C3N4 and Ni2+ ions upon the addition of Ni(NO3)2 solution. Finally, NiS2 nanoparticles were formed on the surface of g-C3N4 upon the addition of TAA. It was found that the NiS2 nanoparticles were solidly and homogeneously grafted on the surface of g-C3N4, resulting in greatly improved photocatalytic H2 production. When the amount of NiS2 was 3 wt%, the resultant NiS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst showed the highest H2 evolution rate (116.343 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121), which is significantly higher than that of the pure g-C3N4 (3 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121).

The inclusion of pure Bi metal in the g-C3N4 layers markedly improved the light absorption of the Bi-CN composites from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region because of the typical surface plasmon resonance of Bi metal.

However, the advantages of easier separation and recycling as well as the ability to terminate the reaction at any time for the CoPz(BuS)8 loaded SiO2@Fe3O4 cannot be ignored. When electron-rich NaN3 was coordinated with CoPz(BuS)8 as an axial ligand and loaded on Al2O3, the resulting catalyst produced more active oxygen species such as O2\u2212 and HO\u2022 to promote the quicker degradation of RhB than that by the other catalysts. For the N3-coordinated CoPz(BuS)8 loaded on Al2O3, the reactions at pH = 4 and 7 distinctly deviated from first-order kinetics, and the degradation rate reached 77.6% after 80 min at pH = 4.",

Under visible-light illumination, a heterogeneous Ag3PO4/Ag/Ag2MoO4 photocatalyst was constructed and demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic activity and photostability compared with pristine Ag3PO4 toward the remediation of the organic dye rhodamine B. The Ag3PO4/Ag2MoO4 hybrid catalyst with 8% mole fraction of Ag2MoO4 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity toward the removal of typical dye molecules, including methyl orange, methylene blue and phenol aqueous solution. Moreover, the mechanism of the photocatalytic enhancement was investigated via hole- and radical-trapping experiments, photocurrent measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and XRD measurements. The XRD analysis revealed that metallic Ag nanoparticles formed initially on the surface of the Ag3PO4/Ag2MoO4 composites under visible-light illumination, leading to the generation of a Ag3PO4/Ag/Ag2MoO4 Z-scheme tandem photocatalytic system. The enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability were attributed to the formation of the Ag3PO4/Ag/Ag2MoO4 Z-scheme heterojunction and surface plasmon resonance of photo-reduced Ag nanoparticles on the surface. Finally, a plasmonic Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. This work may provide new insights into the design and preparation of advanced visible-light photocatalytic materials and facilitate their practical application in environmental issues.",

The as-prepared hollow microspheres assembled as nanoplates with dimensions of approximately 41\u2013148 nm and are dispersed with non-uniform pores on the template surface. By swapping the salt template with KCl or Na2SO4, different morphologies of Bi2WO6 are obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that NaCl plays a key role on the formation of Bi2WO6 with hollow structures. The specific growth mechanism of hollow microspheres was studied in detail. The Bi2WO6 hollow microspheres exhibit an excellent photocatalytic efficiency for NO removal under solar light irradiation, which is 1.73 times higher than for the Bi2WO6 obtained in the absence of any salt template. This enhancement can be ascribed to the simultaneous improvement on the surface area and visible light-harvesting ability from the hollow structures.

The application of Ag particles in TiO2/ZFAB modified cementitious materials is to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. Various Ag@TiO2/ZFAB modified cementitious specimens with different Ag dosages are prepared and the characteristics and photocatalytic performance of the prepared samples are investigated. It is observed that the multi-level pore structure of ZFAB can improve the exposure degree of TiO2 in a cement system and is also useful to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. With an increment of the amounts of Ag particles in the TiO2/ZFAB modified cementitious samples, the photocatalytic activities increased first and then decreased. The optimal Ag@TiO2/ZFAB modified cementitious sample reveals the maximum reaction rate constant for degrading benzene (9.91 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121), which is approximately 3 and 10 times higher than those of TiO2/ZFAB and TiO2 modified samples, respectively.

However, kinetically, the amination reaction will be faster at a higher temperature. Thus, there must be an optimum temperature for the reaction. A high pressure and n(NH3)/n(i-C4H8) molar ratio promote the transformation of isobutylene to tert-butylamine. Developing a highly efficient catalyst under mild reaction conditions is preferred for the amination process. The reaction was investigated over a series of acidic zeolites. ZSM-11 zeolite exhibited the best performance with 14.2% isobutylene conversion (52.2% of the equilibrium conversion) and > 99.0% tert-butylamine selectivity. The effect of reaction conditions on the performance of the ZSM-11 catalyst agreed with the thermodynamic results, which provides guidance for further catalyst development and reaction condition optimization.",

X-ray diffraction, N2 physical adsorption and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption analysis indicated that, although significant improvements to the hydrothermal stability of nano-sized HZSM-5 zeolites can be observed when adopting both phosphorus modification strategies, impregnation with trimethyl phosphate displays further enhancement of the hydrothermal stability. This is because higher structural crystallinity is retained, larger specific surface areas/micropore volumes form, and there are greater numbers of surface acid sites.

     "abstract": "This work examines the influence of preparation methods on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of MnOx-CeO2 catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 (NH3-SCR) at low temperature. Five different methods, namely, mechanical mixing, impregnation, hydrothermal treatment, co-precipitation, and a sol-gel technique, were used to synthesize MnOx-CeO2 catalysts. The catalysts were characterized in detail, and an NH3-SCR model reaction was chosen to evaluate the catalytic performance. The results showed that the preparation methods affected the catalytic performance in the order: hydrothermal treatment > sol-gel > co-precipitation > impregnation > mechanical mixing. This order correlated with the surface Ce3+ and Mn4+ content, oxygen vacancies and surface adsorbed oxygen species concentration, and the amount of acidic sites and acidic strength. This trend is related to redox interactions between MnOx and CeO2. The catalyst formed by a hydrothermal treatment exhibited excellent physicochemical properties, optimal catalytic performance, and good H2O resistance in NH3-SCR reaction. This was attributed to incorporation of Mnn+ into the CeO2 lattice to form a uniform ceria-based solid solution (containing Mn-O-Ce structures). Strengthening of the electronic interactions between MnOx and CeO2, driven by the high-temperature and high-pressure conditions during the hydrothermal treatment also improved the catalyst characteristics. Thus, the hydrothermal treatment method is an efficient and environment-friendly route to synthesizing low-temperature denitrification (deNOx) catalysts.",

The sulfation of CeZr was studied in terms of surface acidity, redox properties and NO adsorption-desorption by temperature-dependent experiments and in situ infrared spectroscopy. S-CeZr displayed high concentrations of acidic sites and increased surface acidities, but poor reducibility compared with CeZr. The high acidity of S-CeZr was attributed to the presence of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites, arising mainly from the surface sulfates. Because the surface was covered with sulfate species, S-CeZr showed lower NO adsorption and weaker oxidation ability than CeZr. The adsorption of NH3 on the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites restricted the reaction with NO at low temperatures, but the selective catalytic reduction cycle occurred easily at relatively low temperatures (150 \u00b0C), and the weakly bound nitrite was partially activated on the S-CeZr catalyst at relatively high temperatures (300 \u00b0C).

Here, we studied the charge transfer at an anatase/rutile TiO2 phase junction using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Visible (\u223c500 nm) and near-infrared (NIR, \u223c830 nm) emissions were monitored to give insight into the photoinduced charges of anatase and rutile in the junction, respectively. New fast photoluminescence decay components appeared in the visible emission of rutile-phase dominated TiO2 and in the NIR emission of many mixed phase TiO2 samples. The fast decays confirmed that the charge separation occurred at the phase junction. The visible emission intensity from the mixed phase TiO2 increased, revealing that charge transfer from rutile to anatase was the main pathway. The charge separation slowed the microsecond time scale photoluminescence decay rate for charge carriers in both anatase and rutile. However, the millisecond decay of the charge carriers in anatase TiO2 was accelerated, while there was almost no change in the charge carrier dynamics of rutile TiO2. Thus, charge separation at the anatase/rutile phase junction caused an increase in the charge carrier concentration on a microsecond time scale, because of slower electron-hole recombination. The enhanced photocatalytic activity previously observed at anatase/rutile phase junctions is likely caused by the improved charge carrier dynamics we report here. These findings may contribute to the development of improved photocatalytic materials.",

Fe-Beta catalysts with the Fe contents of (2.6, 6.3 and 9) wt% were synthesized using different amounts of 0.02 mol/L Fe salt solution.

The Fe content in Beta zeolite did not influence the structure of Beta zeolite and valence state of Fe. Compared with the Fe-Beta catalysts with low Fe content (2.6 wt%), Fe-Beta catalysts with 6.3 wt% Fe content possessed more isolated Fe3+ active sites which led to its higher NH3-SCR activity. A high capacity for NH3 and NO adsorption, and a high activity for NO oxidation also contributed to the high NH3-SCR activity of the Fe-Beta catalyst with 6.3 wt%. However, when the Fe content was further increased to 9.0 wt%, the amount of FexOy nanoparticles increased while the amount of isolated Fe3+ active sites was unchanged, which promoted NH3 oxidation and decreased the NH3-SCR activity at high temperature.",

ZrO2-ipch is a much better support than ZrO2-cs and the traditional ZrO2 irregular particles made by a simple precipitation method (ZrO2-ip). The supported Ni catalyst on ZrO2-ipch (Ni/ZrO2-ipch) exhibited outstanding catalytic activity and coke-resistant stability compared to the ones on ZrO2-cs (Ni/ZrO2-cs) and ZrO2-ip (Ni/ZrO2-ip). Ni/ZrO2-ip exhibited the worst catalytic performance. The origin of the significantly enhanced catalytic performance was revealed by characterization including XRD, N2 adsorption measurement (BET), TEM, H2-TPR, CO chemisorption, CO2-TPD, XPS and TGA. The superior catalytic activity of Ni/ZrO2-ipch to Ni/ZrO2-cs or Ni/ZrO2-ip was ascribed to a higher Ni dispersion, increased reducibility, enhanced oxygen mobility, and more basic sites with a higher strength, which were due to the unique hierarchically structural morphology of the ZrO2-ipch support. Ni/ZrO2-ipch exhibited better stability for the DRM reaction than Ni/ZrO2-ip, which was ascribed to its higher resistance to Ni sintering due to a strengthened metal-support interaction and the confinement effect of the mesopores and coke deposition resistance. The higher coking resistance of Ni/ZrO2-ipch for the DRM reaction in comparison with Ni/ZrO2-ip orignated from the coke-removalability of the higher amount of lattice oxygen and more basic sites, confirmed by XPS and CO2-TPD analysis, and the stabilized Ni on the Ni/ZrO2-ipch catalyst by the confinement effect of the mesopores of the hierarchical ZrO2-ipch support.

X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, the brunauer emmett teller (BET) method, temperature-programmed NH3 desorption, and pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the catalyst. The results showed that loading HPW on H\u03b2 effectively increased the B acidity and decreased the pore size of H\u03b2. The B acidity of HPW/H\u03b2 was 142.97 \u03bcmol/g, which is 69.74% higher than that of H\u03b2 (84.23 \u03bcmol/g). The catalytic activity of the HPW/H\u03b2 catalyst was much better than that of the parent H\u03b2 zeolite because of its high B acidity. The toluene conversion over HPW/H\u03b2 reached 73.1%, which is much higher than that achieved with H\u03b2 (54.0%). When HPW was loaded on H\u03b2, the BET surface area of H\u03b2 decreased from 492.5 to 379.6 m2/g, accompanied by a significant decrease in the pore size from 3.90 to 3.17 nm. Shape selectivity can therefore play an important role and increase the product selectivity of the HPW/H\u03b2 catalyst compared with that of the parent H\u03b2. PTBT (kinetic diameter 0.58 nm) can easily diffuse through the narrowed pores of HPW/H\u03b2, but 3-tert-butyltoluene (kinetic diameter 0.65 nm) diffusion is restricted because of steric hindrance in these narrow pores. This results in high PTBT selectivity over HPW/H\u03b2 (around 81%). The HPW/H\u03b2 catalyst gave a stable catalytic performance in reusability tests.",

     "abstract": "Highly dispersed tungsten carbide (WC) nanoparticles (NPs) sandwiched between few-layer reduced graphene oxide (RGO) have been successfully synthesized by using thiourea as an anchoring and inducing reagent. The metatungstate ion, [H2W12O40]6\u2212, is assembled on thiourea-modified graphene oxide (GO) by an impregnation method. The WC NPs, with a mean diameter of 1.5 nm, are obtained through a process whereby ammonium metatungstate first turns to WS2, which then forms an intercalation compound with RGO before growing, in situ, to WC NPs. The Pt/WC-RGO electrocatalysts are fabricated by a microwave-assisted method. The intimate contacts between Pt, WC, and RGO are confirmed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and Raman spectroscopy. For methanol oxidation, the Pt/WC-RGO electrocatalyst exhibited an electrochemical surface area value of 246.1 m2/g Pt and a peak current density of 1364.7 mA/mg Pt, which are, respectively, 3.66 and 4.77 times greater than those of commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst (67.2 m2/g Pt, 286.0 mA/mg Pt). The excellent CO-poisoning resistance and long-term stability of the electrocatalyst are also evidenced by CO stripping, chronoamperometry, and accelerated durability testing. Because Pt/WC-RGO has higher catalytic activity compared with that of commercial Pt/C, as a result of its intercalated structure and synergistic effect, less Pt will be required for the same performance, which in turn will reduce the cost of the fuel cell. The present method is facile, efficient, and scalable for mass production of the nanomaterials.",

Precise nanosheet morphology and an increased pore distribution with an enlarged surface area are observed for the samples obtained under high temperatures. Optical analysis results show that the bandgap of the samples widens and photoluminescene intensity is gradually quenched as the treating temperature is increased. The results demonstrate that a higher polymerization temperature improves the nanolayer structure, porosity and migration rate of the photo-induced carriers of the samples.

A series of Al2O3-supported Ni catalysts were synthesized, with nickel loading of 8 wt%, using the incipient wetness, wet impregnation, and modified equilibrium deposition filtration methods. The catalysts' surface and bulk properties were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). Used catalysts were characterized by techniques such as elemental analysis and SEM in order to determine the level of carbon that was deposited and catalyst morphology. The results indicated that the synthesis method affected the textural, structural and surface properties of the catalysts, differentiating the dispersion and the kind of nickel species on alumina's surface. The formation of nickel aluminate phases was confirmed by the XRD and TPR analysis and the \u03b2-peak of the Ni/Al-edf catalyst was higher than in the other two catalysts, indicating that the nickel aluminate species of this catalyst were more reducible. Both Ni/Al-wet and Ni/Al-edf catalysts showed increasing CO2 selectivities and approximately constant CO selectivities for temperatures above 550 \u00b0C, indicating that these catalysts successfully catalyze the water gas shift reaction. It was also confirmed that the Ni/Al-edf catalyst had the highest values for glycerol to gaseous products conversion, hydrogen yield, allyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid selectivities at 650 \u00b0C and the lowest carbon deposition of the catalysts tested.

Herein, the results of a detailed investigation into the effects of Lewis acids on this hydrogen autotransfer reaction are reported. It was found that the choice of Lewis acid affected not only the reaction pathway leading to the desired product, but also other reaction pathways that produced several intermediates and by-products.

We believe that the O\u2212O bond was activated by the formation of OOH, which was produced directly from O2 and H2O at the perimeter of the interface between the gold nanoparticles and the TiO2 support, and consequently OOH reacted with CO to form CO2. This reaction mechanism explains the dependence of the CO2 formation rate on O2 pressure at 300 K. In contrast, at high temperature (> 320 K), low-coordinated gold atoms built up on the surface as a result of surface reconstruction due to exposure to CO. The low-coordinated gold atoms adsorbed O2, which then dissociated and oxidized CO on the metallic gold surface.",

In contrast to previous studies, which mainly focused on and clarified the nature of the active oxygen species for the catalytic CO oxidation, which is reversibly formed and replenished under typical reaction conditions, this study demonstrates that directly after calcination an additional oxygen species is present.

Layered-type Nb2O5 synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Nb2O5(HT)) was the most suitable as a support among various types of Nb2O5 including commercially available Nb2O5 samples.

     "abstract": "There are two theories regarding the origin of the remarkable synergistic effect observed in Au-Ag bimetallic catalysts when applied to various oxidative reactions. One is based on the importance of the contact interfaces between AgOx regions and the surface of the bulk Au as active working sites, while the other holds that charge transfer from Ag to Au in a surface Au-Ag alloy causes the catalytic activity. One key point in examining these theories and determining the origin of the synergy involves determining whether or not Ag exists as an oxide or as a metallic alloy on the Au surface. To confirm that enhanced activity results from contact between Ag2O and Au nanoparticles (NPs), a comparative study of catalytic CO oxidation over Au/Ag2O and Ag2O was performed in the present work, using a closed recirculation reaction system. A reaction mixture consisting of a stoichiometric composition of CO and O2 (CO/O2 = 2/1) was supplied to both catalysts and the resulting pressure decrease rates were tracked, from which the amounts of gas consumed as well as the quantity of CO2 produced were determined. The steady state reactions of both Au/Ag2O and Ag2O did not lead to any meaningful difference in the rate of pressure decrease during the oxidation. The pressure decrease over both catalysts was attributed to the reduction of surface lattice O on Ag2O by CO. The results obtained for Au/Ag2O are in good agreement with previous data resulting from the use of Ag-contaminated Au powder (Ag/Au-b) having an oxidized surfaces. This finding suggests that the perimeters between AgOx zones and the bulk Au surface may not function as active sites during CO oxidation. A review of previous results obtained with Ag/Au-b specimens having so-called steady state surfaces indicates that AgOx species in such materials are reduced to the 0 state to form a Ag-Au alloy that provides the active sites.",

Highly dispersed Au nanoparticles and strong structures formed by Au\u2013support interactions were the main active species on the ceria surface. The Raman and H2-TPR results show that the improved catalytic performance of the Au catalysts can be attributed to enhanced strong metal\u2013support interactions and the reducibility caused by ceria doping.

Au/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst showed distinctive catalytic performance, presenting the highest initial HCHO conversion and stability.

All the catalysts deactivated at high GHSV (600000 ml/(g\u00b7s)), but in a quite different rate. Reducible oxide (CeO2 and FeOx) could stabilize gold through O linkage and therefore exhibits a better stability for HCHO oxidation reaction.

Upon subsequent heating, surface reactions occur among adsorbed HCOO, OH, and atomic oxygen and produce CO2, H2O, and HCOOH between 250 and 400 K. The Au(111) steps bind surface adsorbates more strongly than the Au(111) terraces and exhibit larger barriers for HCOO(a) oxidation reactions. The surface reactions also depend on the relative coverages of co-existing surface species. Our results elucidate the elementary surface reactions between formic acid and oxygen adatoms on Au surfaces and highlight the effects of the coordination number of the Au atoms on the Au catalysis.",

It was found that a small amount of gold had a positive effect on the catalytic cracking of light diesel oil and increased propylene production at a relatively low temperature. The maintenance of the ZSM-5 MFI structure, pore size distribution and the density of weak and strong acid sites of the Au/ZSM-5 catalysts depended on the preparation parameters and the Au loading. Simultaneous enhancement of the micro-activity and propylene production relies on a synergy between the pore size distribution and the relative intensity of the weak and strong acid sites. A significant improvement in the micro-activity index with an increase of 4.5 units and in the propylene selectivity with an increase of 23.2 units was obtained over the Au/ZSM-5 catalyst with an actual Au loading of 0.17 wt%.",

The associated ANM formation mechanism is also discussed. The synthesis route consists of physical mixing of the raw materials, water-assisted grinding and heating. The formation mechanism involves replacement of a Mo atom by a Ni atom, generating the metastable intermediate (NH4)4(NiH6Mo6O24)\u00b75H2O. Heating of this intermediate at 120 \u00b0C removes the added water and produces ANM. Catalysts prepared by this method exhibit almost the same physicochemical properties and catalytic performance during the HDS of dibenzothiophene as materials made from ANM synthesized by a chemical precipitation procedure. Compared with traditional hydrothermal or chemical precipitation methods, this water-assisted, solid-state synthesis provides several significant advantages, including simplifying the synthetic procedure, reducing waste and energy costs and increasing product yields. These features will be highly important with regard to allowing the application of ANM in industrial-scale processes involving HDS reactions.

     "abstract": "Aniline, pyrrole and phenanthroline, which have different nitrogen compositions, are used as carbon precursors to synthesize nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (NOMCs) by the nanocasting method. The effect of the precursor on the resultant NOMC is extensively investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry and rotating ring-disk electrode measurements. Salient findings are as follows. First, the precursor has a significant influence on the specific surface area and textural properties. The NOMC materials derived from pyrrole (C-PY-900: 765 m2/g) and phenanthroline (C-Phen-900: 746 m2/g) exhibit higher specific surface areas than the aniline analog (C-PA-900: 569 m2/g). Second, the XPS results indicate that the total nitrogen content (ca. 3.1\u20133.3 at%) is similar for the three carbon sources, except for a slight difference in the nitrogen configuration. Furthermore, the content of the nitrogen-activated carbon atoms is found to closely depend on the precursor, which is the highest for the phenanthroline-derived carbon. Third, the electrochemical results reveal that the electrocatalytic activity follows in the order C-PA-900 < C-PY-900 < C-Phen-900, confirming that the nitrogen-activated carbon atoms are the active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In summary, the precursor has considerable influence on the composition and textural properties of the NOMC materials, of which the ORR electrocatalytic activity can be enhanced through optimization of the NOMCs.",

In this review, we focus on recent advances in the synthesis of ordered mesoporous and macroporous transition metal oxides, perovskites, and supported noble metal catalysts and their catalytic oxidation of VOCs. The porous catalysts outperformed their bulk counterparts. This excellent catalytic performance was due to their high surface areas, high concentration of adsorbed oxygen species, low temperature reducibility, strong interaction between noble metal and support and highly dispersed noble metal nanoparticles and unique porous structures. Catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide over typical catalysts was also discussed. We made conclusive remarks and proposed future work for the removal of VOCs.",

The mechanism responsible for the moderate activity and enantioselectivity of the \u03b2-cyclodextrin derivatives was explored using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, namely 2D 1H rotating-frame overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY), ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, which provide a useful technique for investigating the formation of inclusion complexes. The effects of the pH of the reaction medium, the \u03b2-cyclodextrin derivative dosage, the structure of the modifying amino group, and various substrates on the yield and enantioselectivity were investigated.

To prepare Co3O4/NPC, NPC was pyrolyzed from melamine and phytic acid supported on carbon, followed by the solvothermal synthesis of Co3O4 on NPC. Linear sweep voltammetry was used to evaluate the activity for OER and ORR. For OER, Co3O4/NPC showed an onset potential of 0.54 V (versus the saturated calomel electrode) and a current density of 21.95 mA/cm2 at 0.80 V, which was better than both Co3O4/C and NPC. The high activity of Co3O4/NPC was attributed to a synergistic effect of the N, P co-dopants and Co3O4. For ORR, Co3O4/NPC exhibited an activity close to commercial Pt/C in terms of the diffusion limited current density (\u22124.49 vs \u22124.76 mA/cm2 at \u22120.80 V), and Co3O4 played the key role for the catalysis.

     "abstract": "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is traditionally performed using noble-metals catalysts, e.g. Pt. However, these metal-based catalysts have the drawbacks of high costs, low selectivity, poor stabilities, and detrimental environmental effects. Here, we describe metal-free nitrogen-doped carbon nanoblocks (NCNBs) with high nitrogen contents (4.11%), which have good electrocatalytic properties for ORRs. This material was fabricated using a scalable, one-step process involving the pyrolysis of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) at 800 \u00b0C. Rotating ring disk electrode measurements show that the NCNBs give a high electrocatalytic performance and have good stability in ORRs. The onset potential of the catalyst for the ORR is \u22120.05 V (vs Ag/AgCl), the ORR reduction peak potential is \u22120.20 V (vs Ag/AgCl), and the electron transfer number is 3.4. The NCNBs showed pronounced electrocatalytic activity, improved long-term stability, and better tolerance of the methanol crossover effect compared with a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. The composition and structure of, and nitrogen species in, the NCNBs were investigated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The pyrolysis of Tris at high temperature increases the number of active nitrogen sites, especially pyridinic nitrogen, which creates a net positive charge on adjacent carbon atoms, and the high positive charge promotes oxygen adsorption and reduction. The results show that NCNBs prepared by pyrolysis of Tris as nitrogen and carbon sources are a promising ORR catalyst for fuel cells.",

Various characterization techniques such as N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption, and thermogravimetric analysis were employed to reveal the relationship between the nature of catalyst and its catalytic performance. It was found that the catalytic performance significantly depended on the textural features and acidic properties, which were strongly affected by preparation conditions of the meso-La0.1Zr0.9O\u03b4 composite. Appropriate acidic sites and high accessibility were required to obtain satisfactory catalytic reactions for this reaction.

Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and H2-tempeature-programmed reduction show that the surface oxygen species are the main factor for the catalytic activity in the CO oxidation reaction, while the supported Au species can improve the redox properties and create oxygen vacancy sites on the support. The oxidation state of Au is not the main factor governing the activity of Au/doped-CeO2 catalysts. Additionally, the synergistic effect of Zr and La is discussed.",

Various amounts of KNO3 were impregnated on the catalyst surface to investigate the effects of Zr addition on the K+-poisoning resistance of the CeTiOx catalyst. The NH3-SCR performance of the catalysts showed that the NOx removal activity of the Zr-modified catalyst after poisoning was better than that of the CeTiOx catalyst. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller data indicated that the Zr-containing catalyst had a larger specific surface area and pore volume both before and after K+ poisoning. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy showed that Zr doping inhibited anatase TiO2 crystal grain growth, i.e., the molten salt flux effect caused by the loaded KNO3 was inhibited. The Ce 3d X-ray photoelectron spectra showed that the Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio of CeZrTiOx decreased more slowly than that of CeTiOx with increasing K+ loading, indicating that Zr addition preserved more crystal defects and oxygen vacancies; this improved the catalytic performance. The acidity was a key factor in the NH3-SCR performance; the temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 results showed that Zr doping inhibited the decrease in the surface acidity.

Analysis of reaction effluents and confined organics demonstrated a dual-cycle reaction mechanism when employing ZSM-5. The extent of the hydrogen transfer reaction, a secondary reaction in the MTO process, varied as the catalyst-methanol contact time was changed. In addition, 12C/13C-methanol switch experiments indicated a relationship between the dual-cycle mechanism and the extent of the hydrogen transfer reaction. Reactions employing a low methanol WHSV in conjunction with a long contact time favored the hydrogen transfer reaction to give alkene products and promoted the generation and accumulation of retained organic species, such as aromatics and methylcyclopentadienes, which enhance the aromatic cycle. When using higher WHSV values, the reduced contact times lessened the extent of the hydrogen transfer reaction and limited the generation of methylcyclopentadienes and aromatic species. This suppressed the aromatic cycle, such that the alkene cycle became the dominant route during the MTO reaction.",

The electrochemical activity showed that the catalyst gave outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2 electroreduction. The catalytic activity and formate selectivity depended strongly on the electrolyte conditions. A high faradaic efficiency, i.e., 56%, was achieved for formate formation in KHCO3 (0.5 mol/L). This is attributed to control of formate production by mass and charge transfer processes. Electrolysis experiments using SnO2-50/GDE (an SnO2-based gas-diffusion electrode, where 50 indicates the 50% ethanol content of the electrolyte) as the catalyst, showed that the electrolyte pH also affected CO2 reduction. The optimum electrolyte pH for obtaining a high faradaic efficiency for formate production was 8.3. This is mainly because a neutral or mildly alkaline environment maintains the oxide stability. The faradaic efficiency for formate production declined with time. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that this is the result of deposition of trace amounts of fluoride ions on the SnO2-50/GDE surface, which hinders reduction of CO2 to formate.",

The maximum power density of passive DMFCs fabricated with catalytic electrodes of 200 and 100 nm Pt nanorod arrays were 17.3 and 12.0 mW/cm2, respectively.

Scanning electron microscopy and N2 adsorption-desorption analyses indicated that a composite structure, in which the N-rich surface of the poly-p-phenylenediamine had an increased active center concentration and the high external surface area of the carbon black was conducive to the mass transport, is highly beneficial in terms of promoting the oxygen reduction reaction.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the oxygen content in the catalyst was increased by prolonged air exposure. O 1s spectrum showed increases in the C=O and C\u2013O components, suggesting that atmospheric oxygen reacted with the catalyst. This oxidation leaded to the deactivation of active center, thus the catalytic activity decreased.

     "abstract": "Nafion-membrane-based proton exchange fuel cells (PEMFCs) typically operate at below 100 \u00b0C. However, H3PO4-doped polybenzimidazole (PBI)-based PEMFCs can operate at 100\u2013200 \u00b0C. This is advantageous because of accelerated reaction rates and enhanced tolerance to poisons such as CO and SO2, which can arise from reformed gas or the atmosphere. However, the strong adsorption of phosphoric anions on the Pt surface dramatically decreases the electrocatalytic activity. This study exploits the \u201cthird-body effect\u201d, in which a small amount of organic molecules are pre-adsorbed on the Pt surface to inhibit the adsorption of phosphoric anions. Pre-adsorbate species inhibit the adsorption of phosphoric anions, but can also partially occlude active sites. Thus, the optimum pre-adsorbate coverage is studied by correlating the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt with pre-adsorbate coverage on the Pt surface. The influence of the pre-adsorbate molecule length is investigated using the organic amines, butylamine, octylamine, and dodecylamine, in both 0.1 mol/L HClO4 and 0.1 mol/L H3PO4. Such amines readily bond to the Pt surface. In aqueous HClO4 electrolyte, the ORR activity of Pt decreases monotonically with increasing pre-adsorbate coverage. In aqueous H3PO4 electrolyte, the ORR activity of Pt initially increases and then decreases with increasing pre-adsorbate coverage. The maximum ORR activity in H3PO4 occurs at a pre-adsorbate coverage of around 20%. The effect of molecular length of the pre-adsorbate is negligible, but its coverage strongly affects the degree to which phosphoric anion adsorption is inhibited. Butylamine adsorbs to Pt at partial active sites, which decreases the electrochemically active surface area. Adsorbed butylamine may also modify the electronic structure of the Pt surface. The ORR activity in the phosphoric acid electrolyte remains relatively low, even when using the pre-adsorbate modified Pt/C catalysts. Further development of the catalyst and electrolyte is required before the commercialization of H3PO4-PBI-based PEMFCs can be realized.",

Accordingly, Pt/hNCNC has a larger electrochemical surface area than Pt/hCNC and Pt/XC-72. The Pt/hNCNC catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation, which was better than the control catalysts.

     "abstract": "Fe and Co porphyrins and phthalocyanines are excellent catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and are promising alternatives to Pt in fuel cells. However, the stability of these molecular catalysts in acidic media is poor. This study explores whether demetalation through proton exchange causes these metal macrocyclic catalysts to be unstable in acidic media. We first present a theoretical scheme for investigating exchange reactions of metal ions in metal macrocyclic compounds with protons in acidic media. The equilibrium concentrations of metal ions in solution when various metalloporphyrins (MPs) and metallophthalocyanines (MPcs) are brought into contact with a strongly acidic solution (pH = 1) were then estimated using density functional theory calculations; these values were used to evaluate the stability of these metal macrocyclic compounds against demetalation in acidic media. The results show that Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu phthalocyanines and porphyrins have considerable resistance to exchange with protons, whereas Cr, Mn, and Zn phthalocyanines and porphyrins easily undergo demetalation through ion exchange with protons. This suggests that the degradation in the ORR activity of Fe and Co macrocyclic molecular catalysts and of carbon materials doped with Fe(Co) and nitrogen, which are believed to have metal-nitrogen coordination structures similar to those of macrocyclic molecules as ORR catalytic centers, is not the result of replacement of metal ions by protons. The calculation results show that electron-donating substituents could enhance the stability of Fe and Co phthalocyanines.",

Zeolites, in contrast with activated carbons and oxides, can be designed to have very uniform and controllable micropores, in addition to tailored wettability properties, which can favor the selective adsorption of VOCs.

The nanocomposite was obtained by using an ordered two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal mesoporous anatase 70TiO2-30SiO2-950 nanocomposite (crystallized at 950 \u00b0C for 2 h) as a precursor, NaOH as an etchant of SiO2via a \u201ccreating mesopores in the pore walls\u201d approach. Our strategy adopts mild conditions of creating pores such as diluted NaOH solution, appropriate temperature and solid/liquid ratio, etc. aiming at ensuring the integrities of mesopores architecture and anatase nanocrystals. XRD, TEM and N2 sorption techniques have been used to systematically investigate the physico-chemical properties of the nanocomposites. The results show that the intrawall mesopores are highly dense and uniform (average pore size 3.6 nm), and highly link the initial mesochannels in a 3D manner while retaining mesostructural integrity. There is no significant change to either crystallinity or size of the anatase nanocrystals before and after creating the intrawall mesopores. The photocatalytic degradation rates of rhodamine B (RhB, 0.303 min\u22121) and methylene blue (MB, 0.757 min\u22121) dyes on the resultant nanocomposite are very high, which are 5.1 and 5.3 times that of the precursor; even up to 16.5 and 24.1 times that of Degussa P25 photocatalyst, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the 3D interconnected mesopores structure plays an overwhelming role to the increments of activities. The 3D mesoporous anatase TiO2-SiO2 nanocomposite exhibits unexpected-high degradation activities to RhB and MB in the mesoporous metal oxide-based materials reported so far.

     "abstract": "A novel visible-light-responding InVO4-Cu2O-TiO2 ternary nanoheterostructure was designed on the basis of the strategy of energy gap engineering and prepared through ordinary wet chemistry methods. The as-prepared nanoheterostructure was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis/DRS). The TEM and HRTEM images of 10%InVO4-40%Cu2O-50%TiO2 confirm the formation of nanoheterostructures resulting from contact of the nanosized TiO2, Cu2O and InVO4 in the size of 5\u201320 nm in diameter. The InVO4-Cu2O-TiO2 nanoheterostructure, when compared with TiO2, Cu2O, InVO4, InVO4-TiO2 and Cu2O-TiO2, shows significant enhancement in the photocatalytic performance for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible-light irradiation. With a 9 W energy-saving fluorescent lamp as the visible-light source, the MO degradation rate of 10%InVO4-40%Cu2O-50%TiO2 reaches close to 90% during 5 h, and the photocatalytic efficiency is maintained at over 90% after six cycles. This may be mainly ascribed to the matched bandgap configurations of TiO2, Cu2O and InVO4, and the formations of two p-n junctions by the p-type semiconductor Cu2O with the n-type semiconductors TiO2 and InVO4, all of which favor spatial photogenerated charge carrier separation. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization for the used 10%InVO4-40%Cu2O-50%TiO2 reveals that only a small shakeup satellite peak appears for Cu(II) species, implying bearable photocorrosion of Cu2O. This work could provide new insight into the design and preparation of novel visible-light-responding semiconductor composites.",

The ZnO/P25 composites consist of anatase TiO2 (ATiO2), rutile TiO2 (RTiO2) and hexagonal zincite structures. The parasitic phase of ZnO in P25 leads to the formation of ZnO(002)/ATiO2(101)/RTiO2(110) heterojunctions that exhibit enhanced light absorption and improved multichannel electron/hole separation. ZnO/P25 heterojunctions can completely oxidize toluene into CO2 and H2O under ultraviolet light irradiation at room temperature, and show enhanced photocatalytic activity in comparison with P25 owing to the efficient electron-hole separation. Such a multichannel charge separated design strategy may provide new insight into the design of highly effective photocatalysts and their potential technological applications.",

This catalyst was compared to a common V2O5-TiO2 catalyst with the same vanadia loading prepared by a traditional method. The new catalyst has a surface area of 117.7 m2/g, which was 38% higher than the traditional V2O5-TiO2 catalyst. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) performance demonstrated that the new catalyst had a wider temperature window and better N2 selectivity compared to the traditional one. The NO conversion was >80% from 200 to 450 \u00b0C. The temperature window was 100 \u00b0C wider than the traditional catalyst. Raman spectra indicated that the vanadium species formed more V-O-V linkages on the catalyst prepared by the traditional method. The amount of V-O-Ti and V=O was larger for the new catalyst. Temperature programmed desorption of NH3, temperature programmed reduction by H2 and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results showed that its redox ability and total acidity were enhanced.

For the ZSM-5 zeolite, acid leaching primarily takes place on the crystal surface and the particle size is reduced, therefore the pore channels are shortened. However, because of the good stability of MFI zeolites, the acid does not greatly penetrate the pore channels and new mesopores are not created. For the beta zeolite, because the amorphous material is inclined to dissolve (deagglomerate), some of the micropores are slightly dilated. The improved catalytic activities can be explained by the increased active Fe loading as a result of structural changes.",

A series of cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate nanoparticles with various morphologies (i.e., nanorods, nanosheets, and nanocubes) were successfully synthesized, and Co3O4 nanoparticles were obtained by thermal decomposition of the cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate precursors. The results suggest that the cobalt source is a key factor for controlling the morphology of cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate at relatively low hydrothermal temperatures (\u2264 140 \u00b0C). Nanorods can be synthesized in CoCl2 solution, while Co(NO3)2 solution promotes the formation of nanosheets. Further increasing the synthesis temperature (higher than 140 \u00b0C) results in the formation of nanocubes in either Co(NO3)2 or CoCl2 solution. The reaction time only affects the size of the obtained nanoparticles. The presence of CTAB could improve the uniformity and dispersion of particles. Co3O4 nanosheets showed much higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation than nanorods and nanocubes because it has more abundant Co3+ on the surface, much higher reducibility, and better oxygen desorption capacity.",

In situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface were regenerated by K+ and CO32\u2013, thus promoting the oxidation of HCHO. Moreover, H2-temperature programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that employing KHCO3 as the precipitant increased the Co3+/Co2+ molar ratio on the surface of the Co3O4 catalyst, thus further promoting oxidation. Structural characterization revealed that catalysts precipitated with carbonate or bicarbonate reagents exhibited greater specific surface areas and pore volumes.

The component sizes and size distribution could be varied by carefully controlling the reaction temperature and reaction time. The morphology of the dumbbell-like nanoparticles is closely related to the solvent polarity, the precursor ratio, the lattice mismatch between the two components, and the surfactant concentration.

The Ag3PO4 powders prepared from the precipitation solution with a pH of 6 showed the highest photocatalytic activity for decolorizing the methylene blue and rhodamine B dyes. These Ag3PO4 powders were further modified by the addition of KBr solutions to obtain AgBr/Ag3PO4 powders and these photocatalysts can decolorize the anionic dyes as reactive orange and methyl orange. The reactive species involved in the photocatalytic degradation process were evaluated for their inhibitory activity using the appropriate scavengers. After photocatalysis, mass spectrometry confirmed that the dyes were degraded to smaller molecules. The ecotoxicities of the dye solutions before and after treatment were evaluated by studying their ability to inhibit the growth of the bioindicator Chlorella vulgaris.",

     "abstract": "The synthesis of anisole by vapor phase methylation of phenol with methanol over activated alumina (AA) supported catalysts was investigated in a fixed bed reactor. KH2PO4/AA gave the best performance among the eight tested catalysts. The catalyst was prepared by loading KH2PO4 on AA and then calcining at the optimized temperature of 700 \u00b0C for 8 h. In the vapor phase reaction, the level of anisole yield (LAY) has a maximum at 400\u2013450 \u00b0C when the temperature varied from 300 to 500 \u00b0C, which decreased slightly with increasing WHSV and increased distinctly with increasing mole fraction of methanol. On comparing O-methylation and C-methylation of phenol, a low temperature, high WHSV (short residence time), and a low methanol concentration over the KH2PO4/AA catalyst with higher K contents were found to increase anisole selectivity by O-methylation of phenol. The reaction routes to the major products and the catalytic mechanism were suggested, and a \u2018K-acid\u2019 bifunctional process may be a critical factor to the formation of anisole.",

     "abstract": "Sulfur in transportation fuels is a major source of air pollution. New strategies for the desulfurization of fuels have been explored to meet the urgent need to produce cleaner gasoline. Adsorptive desulfurization (ADS) is one of the most promising complementary and alternative methods. Herein, nanocrystalline ferrite adsorbents were synthesized from metal nitrates and urea using a microwave assisted combustion method. A series of ADS experiments were performed using a fixed-bed reactor to evaluate the ADS reactivity over the ferrites, which was found to have the order MgFe2O4 > NiFe2O4 > CuZnFe2O4 > ZnFe2O4 > CoFe2O4. This effect is explained by the fact that the low degree of alloying of Mg-Fe and the doped Mg increased the interaction between Fe and S compounds, leading to a significant improvement in the desulfurization capability of the adsorbent. Additionally, Mg can dramatically promote the decomposition of thiophene. X-ray diffraction and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy were used to characterize the fresh, regenerated, and sulfided adsorbents. Although the ferrite adsorbents were partially sulfided to bimetallic sulfides during the adsorption process, they were successfully regenerated after calcining at 500 \u00b0C in air.",

     "abstract": "The anaerobic digestion of sludge has recently received increased interest because of the potential to transform organic matter into methane-rich biogas. However, digested sludge, the residue produced in that process, still contains high levels of heavy metals and other harmful substances that might make traditional disposal difficult. We have devised a facile method of converting digested sludge into a mesoporous material that acts as an effective and stable heterogeneous catalyst for the photo-Fenton reaction. A comparison of the removal of rhodamine B under different conditions showed that FAS-1-350, which was synthesized by mixing the digested sludge with a 1 mol/L (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 solution followed by calcination at 350 \u00b0C, exhibited the best catalytic activity owing to its faster reaction rate and lower degree of Fe leaching. The results indicate that Fe2+-loaded catalysts have significant potential to act as stable and efficient heterogeneous promoters for the photo-Fenton reaction, with better performance than Fe3+-loaded catalysts because the Fe(II)/Fe(III) compounds formed in the calcination process are necessary to sustain the Fenton reaction. This protocol provides an alternative, environmentally friendly method of reusing digested sludge and demonstrates an easily synthesized mesoporous material that effectively degrades azo dyes.",

     "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with three-dimensional microporous structures. They have been used as ion-exchangers, catalysts, and adsorbents in various fields such as oil refining, petrochemistry, agriculture, and water and wastewater treatment. Their wide use is because of their many beneficial properties, such as framework and compositional flexibilities, physical and hydrothermal stabilities, non-toxicity, high surface areas, exchangeable cations, and good cost-benefit ratios. Although many zeolite applications depend on their microporous structures, this can cause diffusional constraints for bulky reactant and product molecules. There have been many efforts to overcome the intrinsic limitations of conventional zeolites by preparing nanosized and hierarchically structured zeolites. As a result of these efforts, several strategies have been established and the use of new zeolitic materials in various catalytic and adsorptive reactions has been investigated. Longer lifetimes, high catalytic performances, and postponed coking and catalyst deactivation can be achieved using hierarchical and nanosized zeolites. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the enhanced properties of hierarchical and nanosized zeolites, and recent development methods for their synthesis. The advantages and disadvantages of each route are discussed, and the catalytic applications of nanozeolites and zeolites with secondary porosity, and a comparison with conventional zeolites, are briefly presented.",

MnP activity was significantly enhanced by Mn2+ and Cu2+, and inhibited in the presence of Zn2+, Fe2+, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and cysteine to various extents, with Hg2+ as the most potent inhibitory agent. MnPs from all sources efficiently catalyzed the degradation of the EDCs, nonylphenol and triclosan, removing over 80% after 3 h of treatment, which was further increased up to 90% in the presence of MnP-mediator system. The properties of T. versicolor MnPs, such as high pH and thermal stability, as well as unique Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters and high EDC elimination efficiency, render them promising candidates for industrial exploitation.",

Empty spaces are created in the catalyst as a result of removal of the Al atoms from the zeolite structure. If Si atoms fill the empty space, then the structure of the mesopores becomes similar to silicates, which do not have any catalytic properties. Silicon containing solution was used to fill the empty spaces, and in doing so, a unique method was developed, by which silicon atoms can directly replace the extracted Al atoms from the mesopore structure. Therefore, by changing the geometry and properties of the mesopores and micropores, the amount of coke reduced from 14% for HZSM-5 to 3% for the modified zeolite.",

The development of green catalyst preparation is necessary to prevent and eliminate waste from each step of the catalyst preparation. We summarize recent progress in the application of cold plasmas for green catalyst preparation. Cold plasma preparation can reduce the catalyst size, improve the dispersion and enhance catalyst-support interaction with the use of less or no hazardous chemicals. These improvements also lead to the enhancement of catalyst activity and stability. An alternative room temperature electron reduction with a non-hydrogen plasma as an electron source was developed for the reduction of noble metal ions in which no hazardous chemical reducing agent or hydrogen was needed. This creates many opportunities for the development of supported catalysts with heat sensitive substrates, including metal organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic framework (COFs), high surface area carbon, peptide, DNA, proteins and others. A novel floating metal catalyst on a water (or solution) surface has been established. Template removal using low temperature cold plasmas also leads to the formation of high surface area porous materials with characteristics that are normally only obtainable with high temperature calcination, but sintering can be avoided. Micro combustion has been developed for the removal of carbon template using cold plasma. This is promising for preparing many structured oxides in a simple way with no use of auxiliary chemicals. Many opportunities exist for the use of cold plasmas to make multi-metallic oxides. Some future development ideas are addressed.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption were used to characterize the crystalline phase, morphology, particle size, chemical composition, and surface area of the WO3 samples. The formation of hexagonal (h-WO3) and monoclinic (m-WO3) crystal structures of WO3 at different temperatures or different times was confirmed by XRD. m-WO3 is formed at 600 \u00b0C, while m-WO3 starts to transform into h-WO3 at 800 \u00b0C. However, h-WO3, which forms at 800 \u00b0C, may transform into m-WO3 by increasing the calcination temperature to 1000 \u00b0C. SEM results indicate that m-WO3 particles exhibit a bulky shape with heavy aggregates, while h-WO3 particles exhibit a rod-like shape. Moreover, m-WO3 crystals are sporadically patched on the surface of the h-WO3 rod-like particles, resulting in the exposure of both m-WO3 and h-WO3 on the surface. It is observed that the monoclinic phase (m-WO3)/hexagonal phase (h-WO3) junction was fabricated by tuning the calcination temperature and calcination time. The relative ratios between m-WO3 and h-WO3 in the phase junction can readily be tailored by control of the calcination time. The photocatalytic activities of WO3 with different crystalline phases were evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B as a model pollutant. A higher photocatalytic activity was observed in the WO3 sample with the m-WO3/h-WO3 junction as compared with the sample with only m-WO3. The improvement of photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the reduction of the electron-hole recombination rate owing to the formation of the phase junction, whose presence has been confirmed by HRTEM and photoluminescence spectra.",

The data show that coordinative Cr3+ species represent the active sites during the dehydrogenation of propane and that these species serve as precursors for the generation of Cr3+. Cr3+ is reduced during the reaction, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity. Following ethanol vapor pretreatment, the reduced CrOx in the catalyst is readily re-oxidized to Cr6+ by CO2.

According to the results, MWCNT/ZnCrFeO4/CPEs showed high electrocatalytic activity for warfarin oxidation, producing a sharp oxidation peak current at about +0.97 vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode at pH = 4.0. The peak current was linearly dependent on warfarin concentration over the range of 0.02\u2013920.0 \u03bcmol/L with a detection limit of 0.003 \u03bcmol/L. In addition, chronoamperometry was also used to determine warfarin's catalytic rate constant and diffusion coefficient at MWCNT/ZnCrFeO4/CPEs.",

Each sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD), and infrared spectrascopy of adsorbed pyridine (Py-IR). The results showed that Co was highly dispersed in the Co-SAPO-5 samples. In addition, a part of the Co content had been incorporated into the SAPO-5 framework, while the remainder existed on the surface as extra-framework Co. The surface areas of the Co-SAOP-5 samples were similar to the SAPO-5 sample. However, the pore volumes of the Co-SAOP-5 samples were lower than that of the SAOP-5 sample. As the concentration of Co increased, the pore volume gradually decreased because extra-framework cobalt oxide was present on the catalyst surface. NH3-TPD and Py-IR results revealed that the amount of Br\u00f8nsted acid and the total amount of acid for the Co-SAPO-5 samples were higher than that for the SAPO-5 sample. These values were also higher for samples with higher Co content. The catalytic activity of the Co-SAPO-5 samples was evaluated for the oxidation of cyclohexane with molecular oxygen. When Co was added to the SAPO-5 catalyst, the catalytic activity of the Co-SAPO-5 catalysts improved. In addition, the conversion of cyclohexane increased as the Co content in the Co-SAPO-5 catalysts increased. However, with a high conversion of cyclohexane (>6.30%), the total selectivity of cyclohexanone (K) and cyclohexanol (A) decreased sharply. The K/A ratio ranged from 1.15 to 2.47. The effects of reaction conditions (i.e., reaction temperature, reaction time, initial oxygen pressure, and the catalyst amount) on the performance of the Co-SAPO-5 catalysts have also been measured.

Furthermore, this newly developed method allowed for the direct construction of cyclooctyl furans from their synthetic precursors under Sonogashira conditions. Experimental results revealed that palladium played two major functions in these reactions, including (1) an essential catalyst in the cross-coupling reaction of the substrates; and (2) facilitating the cyclization of the acetylenic alcohol intermediates through a typical \u03c0-activation process. The scope of this chemistry was highlighted by the one-pot synthesis of 3-iodofuran, which provided an opportunity for further functionalization (via coupling methods). Finally, the AuBr3 protocol was also elaborated to domino cyclization/C\u2013H activation reactions, as well as the cyclization of acyclic precursors.

By functionalizing the internal surface area of mesoporous carbon supports with thiol groups and implementing a simple acid extraction step, we are able to design the resulting materials with precise control over the Au nanoparticle size without the need for the presence of any protecting group, whilst simultaneously confining the nanoparticles to within the internal porous network.

The X-ray diffractograms and transmission electron microscopy micrographs show that the particles have controlled and well-defined diameters between 3 and 18 nm at concentrations between 1.1 and 9.0 wt%. The Au nanoparticles are intercalated into the pore matrix to different degrees depending on the synthesis conditions and are stable after high temperature treatment at 600 \u00b0C. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms show that the Au functionalized mesoporous carbon catalysts possess high surface areas (1269\u20131743 m2/g), large pore volumes (0.78\u20131.38 cm3/g) and interpenetrated, uniform bimodal mesopores with the primary larger mesopore lying in the range of 3.4\u20135.7 nm and the smaller secondary mesopore having a diameter close to 2 nm. X-ray absorption near extended spectroscopy analysis reveals changes to the electronic properties of the Au nanoparticles as a function of reduced particle size. The predominant factors that significantly determine the end Au nanoparticle size is both the thiol group concentration and subjecting the as-made materials to an additional concentrated sulfuric acid extraction step.",

     "abstract": "Formaldehyde (HCHO) is carcinogenic and teratogenic, and is therefore a serious danger to human health. It also adversely affects air quality. Catalytic oxidation is an efficient technique for removing HCHO. The development of highly efficient and stable catalysts that can completely convert HCHO at low temperatures, even room temperature, is important. Supported Pt and Pd catalysts can completely convert HCHO at room temperature, but their industrial applications are limited because they are expensive. The catalytic activities in HCHO oxidation of transition-metal oxide catalysts such as manganese and cobalt oxides with unusual morphologies are better than those of traditional MnO2, Co3O4, or other metal oxides. This is attributed to their specific structures, high specific surface areas, and other factors such as active phase, reducibility, and amount of surface active oxygens. Such catalysts with various morphologies have great potential and can also be used as catalyst supports. The loading of relatively cheap Ag or Au on transition-metal oxides with special morphologies potentially improves the catalytic activity in HCHO removal at room temperature. The preparation and development of new nanocatalysts with various morphologies and structures is important for HCHO removal. In this paper, research progress on precious-metal and transition-metal oxide catalyst systems for HCHO oxidation is reviewed; topics such as oxidation properties, structure\u2013activity relationships, and factors influencing the catalytic activity and reaction mechanism are discussed. Future prospects and directions for the development of such catalysts are also covered.",

We investigated the effects of two different alkaline additives, Ca(OH)2 and La(OH)3, on lactic acid formation during sorbitol hydrogenolysis over Ni/C catalyst. In the case of Ca(OH)2, the selectivity of lactic acid was 8.9%. In contrast, the inclusion of La(OH)3 resulted in a sorbitol conversion of 99% with only trace quantities of lactic acid being detected. In addition, the total selectivity towards the C2 and C4 products increased from 20.0% to 24.5% going from Ca(OH)2 to La(OH)3. These results therefore indicated that La(OH)3 could be used as an efficient alkaline additive to enhance the conversion of sorbitol. Pyruvic aldehyde, which is formed as an intermediate during sorbitol hydrogenolysis, can be converted to both 1,2-propylene glycol and lactic acid by hydrogenation and rearrangement reactions, respectively. Notably, these two reactions are competitive. When Ca(OH)2 was used as an additive for sorbitol hydrogenolysis, both the hydrogenation and rearrangement reactions occurred.

The catalytic performance of each of these materials during the selective oxidation of cyclohexane with oxygen in a solvent-free system was subsequently examined. It was found that the MnOx-500 catalyst, calcined at 500 \u00b0C, consisted of a Mn2O3 phase in addition to Mn5O8 and Mn3O4 phases and possessed a low surface area. Unlike MnOx-500, the MnOx-400 catalyst prepared at 400 \u00b0C was composed solely of Mn3O4 and Mn5O8 and had a higher surface area. The pronounced catalytic activity of this latter material for the oxidation of cyclohexene was determined to result from numerous factors, including a higher concentration of surface adsorbed oxygen, greater quantities of the surface Mn4+ ions that promote oxygen mobility and the extent of O2 adsorption and reducibility on the catalyst. The effects of various reaction conditions on the activity of the MnOx-400 during the oxidation of cyclohexane were also evaluated, such as the reaction temperature, reaction time, and initial oxygen pressure. Following a 4 h reaction at an initial O2 pressure of 0.5 MPa and 140 \u00b0C, an 8.0% cyclohexane conversion and 5.0% yield of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone were achieved over the MnOx-400 catalyst. In contrast, employing MnOx-500 resulted in a 6.1% conversion of cyclohexane and 75% selectivity for cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. After being recycled through 10 replicate uses, the catalytic activity of the MnOx-400 catalyst was unchanged, demonstrating its good stability.",

It is shown that the surface Co\u2013O ion pairs are the active site for CO oxidation on the Co3O4 surface. Because of stronger CO adsorption and easier removal of lattice oxygen ions, the Co3O4(011) surface is shown to be more reactive for CO oxidation than the Co3O4(001) surface, which is consistent with previous experimental results. By comparing the reaction pathways at different sites on each surface, we have further elucidated the nature of the crystal plane effect on Co3O4 surfaces and attributed the reactivity to the surface reducibility.

This provided the catalytic system with excellent gas-dynamic properties, and sufficient contact between the reactant gas and catalyst surface. The higher pore density of the ceramic foam filters resulted in a higher photocatalytic rate. More adsorption sites for water vapor and the reactant and product gases improved the photocatalytic activity.

Their photocatalytic activity was evaluated using the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The N-doped TiO2 sample exhibited a much higher visible light photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction than its precursor TiN and commercial TiO2 (P25). This was due to the synergistic effect of the formation of surface heterojunctions on the TiO2 microsheet surface, enhanced visible light absorption by nitrogen-doping, and surface fluorination.",

Electrochemical Mott\u2013Schottky and zeta-potential measurements showed that BOB-1 had a more positive valence band and lower surface charge, leading to superior photocatalytic activity in salicylic acid degradation under visible light. However, BOB-3 was more powerful in RhB degradation because larger numbers of superoxide radicals were generated via electron injection from the excited RhB to its more negative conduction band under visible-light irradiation; this was confirmed using active oxygen species measurements and electron spin resonance analysis. This study deepens our understanding of the origins of organic-pollutant-dependent photoreactivities of semiconductors, and will help in designing highly active photocatalysts for environmental remediation.",

When the reaction time was prolonged to 2 h, the corresponding total organic carbon removals under dark and irradiated conditions were ca. 27% and 72%, respectively. The high catalytic activity of FeIIIGluSiW is resulted from hydrogen bonding of H2O2 on the FeIIIGluSiW surface.

     "abstract": "Noble metal/titania hollow nanomaterials usually exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity because of their high specific surface area, low density, good surface permeability, strong light-harvesting capacity, and rapid interfacial charge transfer. However, the present preparation methods usually include complicated and multistep procedures, which can cause damage to the hollow nanostructures. In this paper, a facile template-induced synthesis, based on a template-directed deposition and in situ template-sacrificial dissolution, was employed to prepare Ag-modified TiO2 (Ag/TiO2) hollow octahedra using Ag2O octahedra as templates and TiF4 as the precursor. In the synthetic strategy, the shells of TiO2 hollow octahedra were formed by coating TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of Ag2O templates based on the template-directed deposition. Simultaneously, the Ag2O templates can be in situ removed by dissolving the Ag2O octahedral template in HF solution produced via the hydrolysis reaction of TiF4 in the reaction system. In addition, Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the inside and outside surfaces of TiO2 shells by effectively using the photosensitive properties of Ag2O and Ag+ ions under light irradiation, along with the formation of TiO2 hollow octahedra. The Ag/TiO2 hollow octahedra exhibited high photocatalytic activity because of their (1) short diffusion distances between photogenerated electrons and holes because of the thin shells of Ag/TiO2 hollow octahedral, (2) deposition of Ag nanoparticles on the inside and outside surfaces of TiO2 shells, and (3) rapid interfacial charge transfer between TiO2 shells and Ag nanoparticles. This work may also provide new insights into preparing other Ag-modified and hollow nanostructured photocatalysts.",

The average nanotube diameter and length was 100 nm and \u223c5 \u03bcm, respectively. The different amount of octahedral Cu2O modified TNTs were obtained by varying electrochemical deposition time. TNTs modified with an optimized amount of Cu2O nanoparticles exhibited high efficiency in the photocatalysis, and the predominant hydrocarbon product was methane. The methane yield increased with increasing Cu2O content of the catalyst up to a certain deposition time, and decreased with further increase in Cu2O deposition time. Insufficient deposition time (5 min) resulted in a small amount of Cu2O nanoparticles on the TNTs, leading to the disadvantage of harvesting light. However, excess deposition time (45 min) gave rise to entire TNT surface being most covered with Cu2O nanoparticles with large sizes, inconvenient for the transport of photo-generated carriers. The highest methane yield under simulated solar and visible light irradiation was observed for the catalysts prepared at a Cu2O deposition time of 15 and 30 min respectively. The morphology, crystallization, photoresponse and electrochemical properties of the catalyst were characterized to understand the mechanism of its high photocatalytic activity. The TNT structure provided abundant active sites for the adsorption of reactants, and promoted the transport of photogenerated carriers that improved charge separation. Modifying the TNTs with octahedral Cu2O nanoparticles promoted light absorption, and prevented the hydrocarbon product from oxidation. These factors provided the Cu2O-modified TNT photocatalyst with high efficiency in the reduction of CO2, without requiring co-catalysts or sacrificial agents.",

The catalysts were used to enhance the catalytic dehydration of lactic acid (LA) to acrylic acid (AA). The effects of cationic species on the structures and surface acid-base distributions of the ZSM-5 zeolites were investigated. The important factors that affect the catalytic performance were also identified. The modified ZSM-5 catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorptions of NH3 and CO2, pyridine adsorption spectroscopy, and N2 adsorption to determine the crystal phase structures, surface acidities and basicities, nature of acid sites, specific surface areas, and pore volumes. The results show that the acid-base sites that are adjusted by alkali-metal species, particularly weak acid-base sites, are mainly responsible for the formation of AA. The KZSM-5 catalyst, in particular, significantly improved LA conversion and AA selectivity because of the synergistic effect of weak acid-base sites. The reaction was conducted at different reaction temperatures and liquid hourly space velocities (LHSVs) to understand the catalyst selectivity for AA and trends in byproduct formation. Approximately 98% LA conversion and 77% AA selectivity were achieved using the KZSM-5 catalyst under the optimum conditions (40 wt% LA aqueous solution, 365 \u00b0C, and LHSV 2 h\u22121).",

The addition of HPWs to the synthesis mixture of hierarchical porous HKUST-1 results in the direct encapsulation of HPWs inside the mesopores of the HKUST-1 structure, with a homogeneous distribution over the HKUST-1 crystals, which is confirmed by XRD, FT-IR, N2 adsorption, UV-Vis DRS, and TEM.

The novel heterogeneous catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of cyclopentene (CPE) to glutaraldehyde (GA) using tert-butyl hydroperoxide and acetonitrile (MeCN) as the oxidant and solvent, respectively. The high activity of the catalyst is attributed to the mesostructure of the catalyst and the nature and appropriate abundance of the HPWs\u2014being highly dispersed with the addition of Lewis sites. After a reaction for 36 h, the 30% wt% HPWs@Meso-HKUST-1 catalyst exhibits a CPE conversion of 92.5% and a high GA yield of 73%.

This is the first demonstration of hierarchical MOR without preferential growth along the c-axis, which facilitates mass transfer in the 12-membered ring channels of MOR zeolite for the conversions involving bulky molecules. The facile method involves the combined use of tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) and commercial surfactants, in which TEAOH is essential for the construction of nanocrystal assemblies. The surfactant serves as a crystal growth-inhibiting agent to further inhibit nanocrystalline particle growth, resulting in enhanced mesoporosity. The hierarchical MOR assembled particles, constructed of 20\u201350-nm crystallites, exhibit superior catalytic properties in the alkylation of benzene with benzyl alcohol compared with the control sample, as the hierarchical MOR possesses a larger external surface area and longer c-axis dimension.

The redox peaks of TTC on an ERGO-0.8V-modified glass carbon electrode (GC/ERGO-0.8V) were within 0\u20130.5 V in a pH 3.0 buffer solution with the oxidation peak current correlating well with TTC concentration over a wide range from 0.1 to 160 mg/L. Physical characterizations with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS) demonstrated that the oxygen-containing functional groups on GO diminished after the electrochemical reduction at \u20130.8 V, yet still existed in large amounts, and the defect density changed as new sp2 domains were formed. These changes demonstrated that this adjustment in the number of oxygen-containing groups might be the main factor affecting the electrocatalytic behavior of ERGO. Additionally, the defect density and sp2 domains also exert a profound influence on this behavior. A possible mechanism for the TTC redox reaction at the GC/ERGO-0.8V electrode is also presented. This work suggests that the electrochemical reduction is an effective method to establish new catalytic activities of GO by setting appropriate parameters.",

H/D exchange demonstrated that the hydrogen chemisorbed on the surface of this nanocomposite catalyst had a hydrogen atom density of 0.65/nm2. It was active for hydrogenation but its activity was inferior to the hydrogen adsorbed on a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Catalytic tests showed that this catalyst possessed a lower activity than Ni/Al2O3 but the selectivity towards p-chloroaniline was above 99.9%. Even at high conversion, the catalyst maintained high selectivity, which was attributed to the unique surface property of the catalyst and the absence of a site for the adsorption of p-chloronitrobenzene, which prevents the C\u2013Cl bond from breaking.",

     "abstract": "Cupric oxide (CuO) and copper-cuprous oxide (Cu-Cu2O) nanoparticles were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method for the synthesis of diethyl carbonate (DEC) from ethanol. During these syntheses, varying NaOH and glucose concentrations were applied to explore and pinpoint the active species. It was found that PdCl2/CuO and PdCl2/Cu-Cu2O both catalysts exhibited good thermal stability and morphology. The results of catalytic tests showed that the catalysts prepared with 5 mol/L NaOH show superior catalytic performances because of their lower extent of agglomeration. It is noteworthy that the PdCl2/Cu-Cu2O catalysts were the most active, especially the PdCl2/Cu-Cu2O catalyst prepared with 10 mmol glucose and having a higher Cu2O concentration. In Pd(II)-Cu(II) (PdCl2/CuO) catalysts, there is an induction period, during which Pd(II) is reduced to Pd(0), that must occur prior to electron transfer between Pd and Cu, and this can slow the catalytic reaction. To further pinpoint the active species, PdCl2/Cu-Cu2O catalysts with different Cu2O contents were prepared by controlling the dosages of glucose. The maximum DEC yield obtained with these catalysts was 151.9 mg\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7h\u22121, corresponding to an ethanol conversion of 7.2% and 97.9% DEC selectivity on an ethanol basis. Therefore, it was concluded that Cu+ was the active species in this catalytic system, possibly because a higher proportion of Cu+ reduces the Pd2+ concentration and limits the CO oxidation side reaction, thus increasing DEC selectivity. In addition, Cu+ promotes electron transfer between Pd and Cu without an induction period, which could also promote the catalytic activity.",

The XRD results confirmed that polythiophene (PTh) had no effect on the crystal structure of TiO2. IR spectra and UV-DRS indicated that an interaction occurs between the interface of PTh and metal oxide in SPNH, and doped metal oxide nanoparticles were incorporated into PTh to form a core-shell structure.

In addition, SPNH exhibited higher photocatalytic activity and stability than STN towards the degradation of organic pollutants nitrobenzene (NB) and malachite green (MG) under visible-light irradiation. Because of the presence of PTh on STN, there was an increase in the adsorption of NB (24%) and MG (21%) on the surface of SPNH, which led to a higher photocatalytic yield. The recyclability of the photocatalytic activity for the photocatalyst was examined by about five runs and not found any depletion or degradation of PTh under visible light irradiation. The high photocatalytic activity of SPNH makes it an attractive candidate as a photocatalyst for industrial water purification.",

Defining the level of ammonia solution to within a certain range resulted in the catalysts possessing a typical bimodal mesoporous structure with an intraparticle framework mesopore and an interparticle textural mesopore (18\u201340 nm). Transmission electron microscopy observations and CO chemisorption results revealed that this unique bimodal mesoporous structure helped to decrease the particle size of Pd nanoparticles and could further enhance their dispersion.

Consequently, the bifunctional Ru/(AC-SO3H) catalyst displayed significantly enhanced activity in one-pot production of hexitols from JAT; the hexitols yield achieved 92.6% over the 3%Ru/(AC-SO3H) catalyst when the reaction was conducted at 373 K and 6 MPa H2 for 3 h. The stability of the catalyst was also investigated, which showed a decreasing trend in the yield of sorbitol with the run number due to poisoning of Ru surface by the impurity in the JAT feedstock.

The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by N2 sorption analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, NH3-temperature-programmed desorption, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The presence of CeO2 in the catalysts led to higher conversion of NOx within a wider operating temperature range. V2O5-xCeO2/Ti-Zr catalyst (x = 0.2) exhibited the highest activity. Higher loadings of CeO2 adversely affected the NOx conversion at higher temperatures. The characterization results revealed that CeO2 was amorphous and highly dispersed over the Ti-Zr support. The catalysts featured single-crystal electron diffraction features. The presence of CeO2 significantly increased the reduction ability of the catalysts, and low V2O5 loadings were beneficial to the low-temperature SCR. V2O5/TiO2 catalyst exhibited medium-to-strong and strong acid desorption of NH3, whereas V2O5/Ti-Zr featured weak acid sites onto which desorption of NH3 occurred. The presence of CeO2 could increase the amount of both the Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acid sites, which were expected to play a key role in the excellent SCR activity. In contrast, the presence of V2O5 reduced the amount of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites. All V2O5-CeO2/Ti-Zr catalysts exhibited poor stability and weak resistance to H2O poisoning but high resistance to SO2. However, the original catalytic activity of V2O5-xCeO2/Ti-Zr (x = 0.3) could be fully restored following poisoning with SO2 and H2O. For the poisoned catalysts, the formation of Ce(SO4)2 led to the decreased catalytic performance at the intermediate temperatures, which increased at the higher temperatures because of the presence of V2O5.",

However, the yield of styrene produced in this way is currently low, and the mechanism responsible for the side-chain alkylation of toluene is poorly understood. Furthermore, the reason for the higher catalytic efficiency of CsX over NaX and KX remains unclear. In this work, the free radical mechanism of the side-chain alkylation of toluene over basic zeolite X has been elucidated using quantum chemical calculations, together with isotope tracing experiments and the reaction between p-nitrotoluene and methanol. The adsorption isotherm of methanol showed that Cs+ ions could block methanol from accessing the \u03b2-cage, which is where the side-chain alkylation reaction occurred. Furthermore, the H\u2013D exchange results between toluene and deuterated toluene (C6D5CD3) showed that CsX was more efficient as a catalyst than KX for the conversion of toluene to the corresponding benzyl radical (C6H5CH2\u2022). These two results therefore explain the higher catalytic activity of CsX towards side-chain alkylation than KX. Based on the free radical mechanism, the selectivity of styrene could be increased from 17.4% to 59.4% using CO2 as carrier gas instead of N2.",

The calculations were carried out on cluster models up to 36 tetrahedra at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The calculated results indicate that both Ti(OSi)4 and Ti(OSi)3OH species can interact with H2O or NH3 molecules to form five-coordinated complexes. The Ti(OSi)3OH species has higher Lewis acidity and adsorbs the ligands more easily than Ti(OSi)4. The Ti-specific band is attributed to the collective vibration of the antisymmetric stretching of Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bonds. The vibrational frequencies of coordinated Ti species can be divided into two regions: the Ti-specific vibration region and the hydroxyl group vibration region.

In this paper, we show that Shilov-type C\u2013H activations are achievable at much higher temperatures (\u223c200 \u00b0C) by addition of concentrated aqueous solutions of Cl\u2212 to inhibit Pt catalyst precipitation. Various chloride-based ionic liquids also stabilized the Pt catalyst at mild reaction temperatures (\u223c140 \u00b0C). Under high-pressure conditions (> 25.5 MPa), achieved using a specially designed sealed gold-tube reactor, very high methane conversion rates (> 90%) were obtained; this is attributed to the improved methane solubility in aqueous solution. Deuterium isotope (H/D) exchange between methane and water was used to examine the reaction reactivity and selectivity. Multiply D-substituted products were observed, indicating that multiple C\u2013H activations occurred. A comprehensive network reaction that included all the chain reactions was set up to clarify the reactivities and product selectivities of the methane activation reactions. The reaction network consisted of a series of parallel first-order reactions, which can be described by the Arrhenius equation. The kinetic parameters such as the frequency factor, activation energies, and stoichiometric coefficients were obtained by fitting the experimental data. Because all four C\u2013H bonds in a methane molecule are equivalent, multiple substitutions during methane conversion cannot be avoided. Our studies indicate that mono-substituted and di-substituted methane isotopologue generations have similar activation energies, suggesting that the highest mono-substitution selectivity cannot be greater than 50%.",

The surface area, pore volume, and mean pore diameter of 10Co9.5Fe/SBA-15-700 were 506.1 m2/g, 0.669 cm3/g, and 7.4 nm, respectively, lower than those of SBA-15. 10Co9.5Fe/SBA-15-700 consisted of rod-like aggregates with diameters greater than 0.25 \u03bcm. It had a magnetic intensity of 8.3 emu/g; therefore, magnetic separation was feasible. 10Co9.5Fe/SBA-15-700 showed good catalytic activity and stability, with a RhB degradation rate higher than 96% and Co leaching lower than 32.4 \u03bcg/L. The catalytic oxidative degradation of RhB in the presence of FeCo/SBA-15 and PMS obeyed first-order kinetics, and the degradation rate increased with increasing CoFe/SBA-15 and PMS dosages and with decreasing initial reactant concentrations. Quenching tests showed that sulfate radicals played a dominant role in RhB catalysis. CoFe/SBA-15 maintained high catalytic activity and good stability during 10 recycling runs, with a RhB degradation rate greater than 84%, Co and Fe leaching for each run lower than 72.1 and 35 \u03bcg/L, respectively. CoFe/SBA-15 is an efficient catalyst for PMS oxidation, and has potential applications in the removal of refractory organics such as RhB in water.",

     "abstract": "The application of porous carbon in catalytic transformation of cellulose has received considerable interest owing to increasing energy and environmental pressures. In this mini-review, we first outline the featured properties of porous carbon in catalytic cellulose transformation in terms of porosities and surface functionalities. An interconnected hierarchical structure and enrichment of mesopores are highly desired for reactant, intermediate, and product diffusion; while hydrophilic surfaces are favored in aqueous phase transformation and certain acidic oxygen functionalities play a role of acid sites as well as enhancing the adsorption of feedstock via 1,4-glycosidic bonds. We then summarize specific reactions in cellulose transformation in the order of hydrolysis and hydrolytic hydrogenation. In the hydrolysis of cellulose, porous carbon is generally used as a solid acid by taking advantage of its enriched oxygen functionalities, while in the hydrolytic hydrogenation, carbon serves as the support of bifunctional catalysts with active acidic sites. Finally, the synthesis and potential application of specific novel porous carbon materials, such as heteroatom-modified porous carbon and mesoporous carbon composites, are highlighted.",

     "abstract": "The efficient transformation of abundant and renewable lignocellulosic biomass for the production of chemicals and fuels is of considerable importance for establishing a sustainable society. The selective catalytic conversion of the major components of lignocellulosic biomass, including cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, into key platform chemicals under mild conditions represents an ideal route for the utilization of this abundant resource. Cellulose is composed of multiple glucose units, which are linked together through \u03b2-1,4-glycosidic bonds, and the selective cleavage of these glycosidic bonds would therefore provide access to glucose and glucose derivatives. Hemicellulose is a heteropolysaccharide composed of different sugar units such as glucose, mannose, xylose, arabinose and galactose. The selective cleavage of the glycosidic bonds in hemicelluloses would therefore provide a mixture of different sugars. In contrast to cellulose and hemicellulose, lignin is a complex macropolymer consisting of methoxylated phenylpropane structures. Furthermore, lignin contains a variety of different C\u2013O bond types, including \u03b2-O-4, \u03b1-O-4 and 4-O-5 bonds, which connect the primary aromatic units in lignin. The selective cleavage of these C\u2013O bonds would therefore lead to the formation of high-value aromatic compounds. In this review article, we have provided a detailed summary of recent advances towards the development of new catalysts and novel strategies for the selective cleavage of the C\u2013O bonds in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, as well as closely related model systems, for the production of glucose, glucose derivatives (including alkyl glucosides, hexitols and gluconic acid), xylose, arabinose and aromatic compounds. The key factors determining catalytic performances have been described in detail. The reaction mechanisms have also been discussed to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of the processes involved in the selective activation of C\u2013O bonds.",

Oxide-supported noble metal catalysts are well known to be excellent CO oxidation catalysts. However, the high cost and limited supply of these noble metals pose significant challenges for sustainable applications. Maximizing the atom efficiency of supported noble metal catalysts is therefore highly desirable. In this work, a Co3O4 supported Au single-atom catalyst with very low Au (0.05 wt%) loading has been developed. This catalyst showed extremely high activity for CO oxidation and exhibited total conversion of CO at room temperature. The high activity originates from the isolated Au atoms distributed on the Co3O4 nanocrystallites, although the exact catalytic mechanism is still under investigation. The catalyst deactivation observed during the CO oxidation was attributed to the accumulation of CO2 rather than sintering of the single Au atoms. This extremely low loading of Au coupled to high activity is critical to reducing the cost of noble metal catalysts and making them more practical and attractive.",

     "abstract": "Since the 1980s, photocatalysis research has expanded at an unexpected rate. Fabrication of phase junctions has proved to be an effective method to enhance photocatalytic performance. As a model photocatalyst, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been extensively studied. This feature article mainly reviews the study on TiO2 surface phase junctions, including the characterization of the surface phases of TiO2, the use of anatase: rutile TiO2 phase junctions in photocatalytic hydrogen production, and the current understanding of how TiO2 phase junctions work in photocatalysis. The surface structure of TiO2 can be well characterized by ultraviolet (UV) Raman spectroscopy, unlike X-ray diffraction and visible Raman spectroscopy. Based on these results, the mechanism of phase transformation processes of TiO2 was clearly identified. The infrared (IR) spectra of probe molecules CO and CO2 on TiO2 further characterized the surface structure of TiO2, strongly supporting the UV Raman results. Furthermore, the typical visible emission of anatase and near-infrared emission of the rutile phase of TiO2 make photoluminescence (PL) a suitable technique to characterize the surface phase structure of TiO2. PL can also provide information about the carrier dynamics of TiO2 in photocatalysis. Because of the surface phase junction formed between anatase and rutile, the mixed-phase structure of TiO2 exhibits a superior H2 production activity to those of pure anatase or rutile phase. The activity of Degussa P25 TiO2 can be further increased by three to five times by tuning the phase structure through thermal treatment. Moreover, the phase transformation of TiO2 from anatase to rutile can be controlled by surface modification with Na2SO4, resulting in catalysts with activity six times higher than that of P25. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy provided a clear phase-junction image of TiO2, which showed atomic contact at the interface of the phase junction. The mechanism of phase junctions improving photocatalytic performance was investigated by time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. The charge transfer process across the anatase: rutile phase junction was confirmed by the results of time-resolved IR measurements, and electron transfer from anatase to rutile phases is proposed to occur in mixed-phase TiO2. These studies on the phase junctions of TiO2 improve our understanding of photocatalysis and may inspire new ideas for the design of promising photocatalytic systems.",

The acid-base property on the surfaces of these MgO-Al2O3 supports were systematically varied by tuning the molar Mg/Al ratio (x) before they were loaded with the catalytic Au NPs. Au NPs on the most acidic and least basic MgO-Al2O3 exhibited the highest activity for GL activation and the highest selectivity for dihydroxyacetone (DHA) production. Increasing the surface basicity or lowering the acidity of the MgO-Al2O3 support results in continuously improved selectivity for glyceric acid (GLA) but lowered the selectivity for DHA. These correlations disclose for the first time that the support acid-base property inversely affects the formation of DHA and GLA, and demonstrate that the support acidity/basicity is a key to the selectivity control of their carrying Au NPs for GL oxidation.",

Herein, the hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived sorbitol was studied on Pd-modified Cu/monoclinic zirconia (Pd-Cu/ZrO2) catalysts with a wide range of Cu/Pd atomic ratios in the presence of La(OH)3. The bimetallic Pd-Cu/ZrO2 catalysts showed superior activities and selectivities to the two target glycols, compared with the monometallic Cu/ZrO2 and Pd/ZrO2 catalysts under identical conditions. At nearly 100% sorbitol conversion, a combined selectivity of 61.7% to ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and glycerol was obtained on Pd-Cu/ZrO2 (Cu/Pd=5) at 493 K under 5.0 MPa H2. Pd-Cu/ZrO2 was also stable and recyclable, in contrast to Cu/ZrO2, which suffered severe deactivation because of agglomeration of Cu particles during sorbitol hydrogenolysis. Clearly, the presence of Pd improved not only the activity and selectivity of the Cu catalyst, but also the hydrothermal stability. Characterization of these catalysts by X-ray diffraction, diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of CO adsorption, and H2 temperature-programmed reduction suggests that the Cu particles deposited on the Pd surfaces with close contact and strong interaction between the two metals, most likely involving electron transfer from Pd to Cu. Such structural and electronic effects are proposed as the critical contributors to the significant promoting effect of Pd on the activity and stability of Pd-Cu catalysts in sorbitol hydrogenolysis. These findings provide useful information for design of new Cu-based catalysts with higher efficiency and stability for selective hydrogenolysis of polyols and other biomass-derived reactants under hydrothermal conditions.",

     "abstract": "Understanding the overall catalytic activity trend for rational catalyst design is one of the core goals in heterogeneous catalysis. In the past two decades, the development of density functional theory (DFT) and surface kinetics make it feasible to theoretically evaluate and predict the catalytic activity variation of catalysts within a descriptor-based framework. Thereinto, the concept of the volcano curve, which reveals the general activity trend, usually constitutes the basic foundation of catalyst screening. However, although it is a widely accepted concept in heterogeneous catalysis, its origin lacks a clear physical picture and definite interpretation. Herein, starting with a brief review of the development of the catalyst screening framework, we use a two-step kinetic model to refine and clarify the origin of the volcano curve with a full analytical analysis by integrating the surface kinetics and the results of first-principles calculations. It is mathematically demonstrated that the volcano curve is an essential property in catalysis, which results from the self-poisoning effect accompanying the catalytic adsorption process. Specifically, when adsorption is strong, it is the rapid decrease of surface free sites rather than the augmentation of energy barriers that inhibits the overall reaction rate and results in the volcano curve. Some interesting points and implications in assisting catalyst screening are also discussed based on the kinetic derivation. Moreover, recent applications of the volcano curve for catalyst design in two important photoelectrocatalytic processes (the hydrogen evolution reaction and dye-sensitized solar cells) are also briefly discussed.",

CeO2 exhibits significant catalytic activity under mild reaction conditions (60 \u00b0C) during the synthesis of 13 different imines, giving >89% conversions and >90% selectivities. The crystal planes of CeO2 greatly affect the catalytic performance. Among the crystal planes investigated (the (110), (100) and (111) planes), the (110) plane shows the strongest redox ability and thus the best catalytic activity, generating a 97% yield of the imine at 60 \u00b0C in 2 h, because it contains the highest concentration of oxygen vacancies.",

     "abstract": "Fe-based catalyst is an outstanding candidate for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction to get light olefins from syngas directly. However, exposed Fe species are susceptible to sintering and coking, which lead to deactivation. Here, we demonstrate that Fe nanoparticles encapsulated in pod-like carbon nanotubes (Pod\u2013Fe) can be used as an efficient Fischer-Tropsch catalyst to produce light olefins. It gave a higher selectivity of light olefins (45%) and high stability over 120 h reaction (P = 0.5 MPa, T = 320 \u00b0C, CO:H2 = 1:2, gas hourly space velocity = 3500 h\u22121). A catalyst with exposed Fe particles on the outside of the Pod-Fe (FeOx/Pod-Fe) catalyst showed a selectivity of light olefins of 42%, but had a significantly lower stability due to the agglomeration of Fe nanoparticles and carbon deposition. These results indicated that the graphene shell of Pod-Fe played an important role in protecting the Fe particles and provided a rational way to enhance the activity and stability of Fe-based catalysts in high temperature reactions.",

The dehydration of fructose and subsequent in situ hydrodeoxygenation of HMF to DMF and DMTF on Ru/C were enhanced by the use of an ionic liquid and a biphasic [BMIm]Cl/THF solvent. Elemental analysis, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and H2-temperature programmed reduction\u2013mass spectroscopy characterization showed that the ionic liquid modified the electronic density of the Ru species to favor HMF in situ hydrodeoxygenation. Moreover, THF served as a reaction-extraction solvent that extracted DMF and DMTF from the reaction layer to avoid further side reactions. A rational design that gave enhancement of the catalytic performance and product protection provides a promising strategy for the one-pot conversion of biomass to desired fuels.",

N-doped carbon materials have been regarded as one of the most promising Pt-alternative catalysts. In this work, the N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon was synthesized by the nanocasting method using SBA-15 as the template. The effect of the pyrolysis conditions (pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis duration, and ramp rate) on this material was investigated. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the intrinsic properties of the resultant materials. Cyclic voltammetry and rotating ring-disk electrode were used to investigate the electrochemical behavior for ORR in an alkaline medium. It was found that the resultant mesoporous carbon materials exhibit high electrical conductivity, high specific surface area, and unique pore structure. The pyrolysis temperature was the most important parameter in determining the thermodecomposition of the carbon precursor, and the microstructure, elemental composition, and chemical configuration of the resultant mesoporous carbon materials. To achieve reasonable electrocatalytic activity and selectivity, a high pyrolysis temperature above 800 \u00b0C is required for effective N doping to form active sites and for graphitization to facilitate charge transfer, whereas the pyrolysis duration and ramp rate have a much less significant effect. This indicates that both the surface composition/structure and consequent electrochemical properties are more dependent on the thermodynamics than the kinetics during the pyrolysis process. Finally, the optimal N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon catalyst showed superior electrochemical activity for ORR than the commercial Pt catalyst and is promising for fuel cell and metal\u2013air battery applications.",

It is notable that the CSAC catalyst exhibited a high degree of catalytic stability that was comparable to that of conventional catalysts and was able to maintain a selectivity for isobutene of approximately 76%.

     "abstract": "Double metal cyanide (DMC) catalysts are generally prepared by coprecipitation of potassium hexacyanocobaltate(III) with zinc chloride followed by complexation with tert-butanol, and these materials have been used for several decades in the copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides. However, the catalytic efficiency of DMC catalysts can be adversely affected by the presence of excess K+, and the preparation of these catalysts can therefore become complicated and time-consuming because of the multiple washing and centrifugation stages required for the removal of the excess K+. In this study, 18-crown-6 ether was used as an effective co-complexing agent for the removal of K+. A series of DMCs containing 18-crown-6 were prepared with different quantities of the crown ether and different washing times. The resulting crown ether-complexing catalysts (CDMCs) and DMC catalysts without crown ether were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis-IR and X-ray diffraction. These characterization results showed that the inclusion of 18-crown-6 allowed for the formation of uniform and highly dispersed CDMC catalysts. In contrast, the DMC catalysts prepared in the absence of 18-crown-6 became uneven and delaminated during the purification by centrifugation, with high- and low-density portions of the material forming on the bottom and top of the catalyst cakes, respectively. The inclusion of 18-crown-6 not only trapped K+ but also participated in the complexion process. The complexion of tert-BuOH and 18-crown-6 led to a less crystalline form of the CDMC catalyst. Elemental analysis revealed that CDMC1 contained 1.2% K+. The copolymer was obtained by the copolymerization of CO2 with propylene oxide using CDMC3 catalyst, which was superior to the copolymer prepared using DMC1. CDMC3 was as active as DMC2 prepared without the crown ether but with seven washing steps. A hypothetical two-stage catalytic mechanism was proposed.",

     "abstract": "The adsorption of ethanol and important intermediates onto Ag/Al2O3 catalyst employed in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx by ethanol was simulated by density functional theory. Considering the interaction between Ag metal and Al2O3 support, typical Ag\u2013O\u2013Al entities, i.e., Ag\u2013O\u2013Altetra and Ag\u2013O\u2013Alocta, (tetra = tetrahedral and octa = octahedral refer to the coordination sites of Al), were selected as potential adsorption sites on the surface of the catalyst. Ethanol, and enolic and isocyanate species were preferentially adsorbed and activated by Ag\u2013O\u2013Altetra entities rather than by Ag\u2013O\u2013Alocta entities. The strong Lewis acidity of Altetra in the Ag\u2013O\u2013Altetra entity was very important, enabling the entity to accept an electron via forward donation from either the C\u2013O \u03c3 bond in ethanol or the N\u2013C \u03c3 bond in the \u2013NCO species. Moreover, the hybridization of the Ag and Al orbitals was critical for electron back donation from the Ag\u2013O\u2013Altetra entity to the C\u2013C \u03c0 bond in the enolic species or N\u2013C \u03c0 bond in the \u2013NCO species. The significant activation of the N\u2013C bond in \u2013NCO on the Ag\u2013O\u2013Altetra sites facilitated cleavage of \u2013NCO to form N2. Thus, we can conclude that the acidity of the Al site and the interaction between Ag and Al play key roles in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx by ethanol over Ag/Al2O3.",

As a result, the wall defects after solvothermal treatment decrease, and the stability of silica is improved remarkably. This promoting effect strongly depends on the solvent properties, treatment temperature, and precursors of SBA-15 zeolite. The treatment by a nonpolar and low boiling point organic solvent displays the highest promoting effect on the calcined SBA-15 zeolite.

The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the H2 evolution water splitting reaction. The monoclinic phase of NaTaO3 remained intact for the two Bi-doped samples, but the Ta\u2013O\u2013Ta bond was distorted from 180\u00b0 after Bi doping. XPS results indicated that Bi3+ was doped into NaTaO3 with the Bi(NO3)3 precursor, while Bi5+ and Bi3+ were doped into NaTaO3 with the NaBiO3 precursor. The two samples showed identical light absorption, where doping with Bi extended the light absorption to long wavelength light as expected. However, Bi3+ doping did not promote the photocatalytic activity of NaTaO3, while Bi5+ and Bi3+ doping did. The distorted Ta\u2013O\u2013Ta bond from 180\u00b0 due to doping with Bi was detrimental for charge carrier transfer in the photocatalytic process. In contrast, the vacancies or defects in the NaTaO3 lattice induced by Bi doping for charge balance were beneficial for charge carrier separation. The opposing action of these two factors resulted in the activity of the Bi3+-doped sample being comparable with pristine NaTaO3. For Bi5+- and Bi3+-doped NaTaO3, a high concentration of defects was induced by the high valence Bi5+ ion and this led to its higher photocatalytic activity. Our results indicated that charge carrier transfer is a priority factor in the photocatalytic process and the doping of a high valence ion in the ABO3 structure is a way to promote the separation of charge carriers.",

     "abstract": "This work demonstrates an improved (NH4)2SiF6 treatment to enhance the hydrothermal stability of mesoporous SBA-15 zeolite. In this treatment, Al3+ ions are incorporated into SBA-15 zeolite first, then it is treated with 5% (NH4)2SiF6 solution according to 1% SiO2 of SBA-15 and finally washed with HCl (2 mol/L) to remove the pre-incorporated Al3+ ions. The obtained SBA-15 exhibits higher hydrothermal stability than that without pre-incorporated Al3+. Compared with the latter, the sample maintains a better ordered mesostructure and a larger surface area (271 m2/g) after hydrothermal treatment at 800 \u00b0C for 12 h in 100% steam. The results show that incorporating Al3+ ions into SBA-15 zeolite before (NH4)2SiF6 treatment obviously promotes the stabilization effect of (NH4)2SiF6 treatment. The mechanism suggests that the incorporated Al3+ ions can effectively capture F\u2212 ions that have been released from (NH4)2SiF6, and thus reduce their etching into the SBA-15 zeolite framework. This ensures that the positive factors of (NH4)2SiF6 treatment, such as silicon insertion and surface hydrophobization by F\u2212 ions, play effective roles in the improvement of the hydrothermal stability of SBA-15 zeolite. This promoting effect of the Al3+ ions is closely related to the method that is used to introduce the Al3+ and the SBA-15 zeolite processing temperature.",

The highest photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) was with the melamine/GO mass ratio of 800/1, with a first order rate constant 2.6 times that of pristine g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was assigned to the rGO-promoted separation of photo-generated electron (e\u2212)-hole (h+) pairs. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/rGO was pH sensitive with a much increased photodegrading rate at low pH values. The first order rate constant was 8.6 times that of pristine g-C3N4 at pH = 1.98. The pH sensitive behavior resulted from the promoted oxidation of h+ with RhB by the consumption of e\u2212 with the reaction of proton (H+) in which rGO acted as a good platform for transferring e\u2212 through its atomic sheets.",

The adsorption energies of CH3Cl (\u201318 kJ/mol) and CH3Br (\u201322 kJ/mol) into a SAPO-34 catalyst were calculated, and the results revealed that these methylating agents were not being accurately distinguished because of similarities in the electronegativities of their halogen atoms. The reaction energies and energy barriers were also obtained for the geminal methylation reactions of a series of methylbenzenes using CH3Cl and CH3Br. The results of these calculations suggested that the geminal methylation of hexamethylbenzene (HMB) was exothermic based on the negative reaction energies, whereas the geminal methylation reactions of all of the other methylbenzenes were endothermic. Furthermore, the energy barriers for the geminal methylation of HMB with CH3Cl and CH3Br were lower than those of the other methylbenzenes evaluated in the current study, which indicated that HMB was forming strong electrostatic interactions within the structural framework of the molecular sieves, and that the reactivity of the methylbenzene substrate increased as the number of methyl groups increased.",

     "abstract": "Direct conversion of syngas into hydrocarbons with high selectivity remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of a core\u2013shell-structured catalyst constituting Cr-Zn oxide as the core and SAPO-34 as the shell for the conversion of syngas into hydrocarbons with high selectivity. A SiO2 layer was sandwiched between the core and the shell to prevent damage to the core during shell synthesis. Furthermore, the intermediate SiO2 layer acted as a Si source for the formation of the shell. The prepared catalyst displayed considerably higher selectivity toward the production of C2\u2013C4 hydrocarbons (66.9%) than that of methanol and methane. The findings show the potential of the prepared core\u2013shell-structured catalyst in the one-step production of hydrocarbons, such as liquefied petroleum gas, from syngas. However, further optimization of the catalyst is necessary to achieve higher performance.",

Pd-O/CeO2-NT was used as the catalyst for the oxidative carbonylation of phenol. It has better activity and DPC selectivity than Pd-O/CeO2-P, which was prepared by supporting Pd on zero dimensional CeO2 particles. Under the optimized conditions, phenol conversion was 67.7% with 93.3% DPC selectivity with Pd-O/CeO2-NT. However, its catalytic activity decreased when the catalyst was used for the second time. This was attributed to the destruction of the tubular structure of Pd-O/CeO2-NT and Pd leaching during the reaction.",

The catalytic performance of the ZSM-5 additives was evaluated using an ultra-stable Y-zeolite (USY)-based fluid catalytic cracking catalyst in a fixed fluid bed unit. As observed, the cracking of primary olefins over the hybrid catalysts consisting of USY-based catalyst and ZSM-5 additive was considerably inhibited by increasing the SAR of the ZSM-5 zeolite, thus avoiding substantial loss of gasoline paraffins. The introduction of ZSM-5 additives led to higher liquid petroleum gas yields as well as higher isobutane and isopentane yields. The improved yields were attributed to the combined effects of the ZSM-5 additives and USY-based catalyst. The variations of gasoline paraffins and aromatics both accounted for the enhancement in the octane number values. The use of ZSM-5 with higher SARs (266 and 487) led to an enhancement in the octane number with minimal loss of gasoline. This enhancement was mainly attributed to the moderate aromatization and isomerization reactivity of the ZSM-5 additives that mainly originated from their relatively small pores and suitable acidic properties with higher SARs.",

The benzene selectivity was the highest for the silylated Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (benzene + naphthalene selectivity after 1 h on stream was close to 100%). The deactivation of precarburized zeolites was less pronounced than that of zeolites heated in air or He. During heating in air or He, larger fractions of the molybdenum oxide species diffused into the micropores than during heating in methane. Carburization of the molybdenum oxide species in the micropores during MDA resulted in the formation of molybdenum carbide particles, and these contributed to pore blocking, making the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites inaccessible. The formation of molybdenum carbides during heating in methane resulted in a less mobile Mo phase. It is argued that the presence of molybdenum carbide particles in the micropores contributes to rapid catalyst deactivation, in addition to the formation of hard coke on the external surface.",

The appropriate ratio and amounts of AC and p-TsOH were an important factor. The acidity of p-TsOH does not play a significant role. p-TsOH reacted with H2O2 by a non-radical process to oxidize styrene. The function of the AC was to activate H2O2 and to help the p-TsOH/H2O2 system in styrene oxidation. The reduction of oxygen containing groups (\u2013OH, \u2013COOH) on AC by a high temperature treatment or introduction of \u2013SO3H groups onto AC affected the styrene conversion. The \u2013SO3H groups were more effective than the oxygen-containing groups on the AC in promoting styrene oxidation.",

The synthesized zinc complex was used as a precursor to produce ZnO nanostructures by calcination at 550 \u00b0C for 4 h. Morphological studies by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of porous microbricks of ZnO nanoparticles. N2 adsorption-desorption analysis showed that the obtained ZnO microbricks possess a mesoporous structure with a surface area of 8.13 m2/g and a pore size of 22.6 nm. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the final product proved the formation of a pure ZnO composition with a hexagonal structure. Moreover, FTIR analyses showed that the 2-aminonicotinic acid ligand peaks were absent after the calcination step. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to determine the band gap energy of the produced ZnO and it was about 3.19 eV. To investigate the photocatalytic activity of the porous ZnO nanostructure, a series of photocatalytic tests were carried out to remove Congo red, as a representative toxic azo dye, from aqueous solution. The results show that the product can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for waste water treatment with high degradation efficiency.",

     "abstract": "We present a simple method to increase the efficiency of a direct ethanol fuel cell by a periodic modulation of the load (pulsed mode). The fuel cell was periodically short circuited with a resistor (1 \u03a9) for a few seconds (high load period) followed by a low load period of up to 100 s when the resistor was disconnected. The open circuit voltage (OCV) values before and after the short circuit of the cell showed an increase of up to 70 mV. The higher OCV was due to the oxidation and removal of strongly adsorbed CO during the electric short circuit when the electric potential of the anode was increased to be close to the cathode potential. The depoisoned anode surface was much more active directly after the short circuit. The slow decrease of the OCV observed after the short circuit was caused by the subsequent poisoning of the anode surface, which can be neutralized by another short circuit. In general, a stable increase in cell performance was obtained by repetition of the electric short circuit. The data showed that the pulse mode gave an increase in the power generated by the direct ethanol fuel cell by up to 51% and was 6% on average. It is anticipated that this mode of operation can be used also in different types of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells where CO poisoning is a problem, and after optimization of the parameters, a much higher gain in efficiency can be obtained.",

The crystalline nature of TiN0.3 and CeO2 was confirmed by XRD, and SEM images showed that CeO2 spheres uniformly distributed on the TiN0.3 surface. In addition to visible light absorption by TiN0.3, UV light was also harvested by the outer CeO2 component on the TiN0.3/CeO2 combined photo-anode.

The specific double-layer structure of TiN0.3/CeO2 contributed to its improved photo-electrocatalytic performance. Electron transfer from CeO2 to TiN0.3 driven by the hetero-junction and hole consumption by Ce3+ at the TiN0.3/CeO2 interface promoted the separation of electron and hole in the CeO2 layer, which improved the photo-current generation. Ce3+ that existed in CeO2 acted as the adsorption and activation site for H2O and accelerated the oxidation of H2O on the CeO2 surface, which further led to the high and stable photo-current density generated in TiN0.3/CeO2.

However, the design of ligand systems with vanadium catalysts would face difficulties, because it is difficult to experimentally determine the structures of the active species of vanadium catalysts. In this paper, possible structural candidates for the active species in ethylene polymerization catalyzed by the salicylaldiminato vanadium complex combined with AlEt2Cl were investigated using density functional theory. By comparing theoretical simulation results with previous experimental investigations, especially regarding the crucial role of the diethyaluminum chloride (AlEt2Cl) cocatalyst, it was concluded that a neutral bimetallic species containing two Al\u2013Cl\u2013V bridging bonds is the most favorable structure model for the active vanadium species. A notable effect of Al co-catalysts was clarified in the theoretical investigation. During the formation of the active species, AlEt2Cl act as an assistant for the alkylation and alkyl abstract processes of precursors. More importantly, AlEt2Cl is necessary for the formation of the bis(chlorine-bridged) structure in the active species, which showed a notable effect on the structural stability of the active species and its catalytic activity.

Results show that, in the non-equilibrium plasma produced by DBD, H2 dramatically improved not only the conversion of methanol but also the selectivity for EG. Using the reaction conditions of 300 \u00b0C, 0.1 MPa, input power 11 W, discharge frequency 12.0 kHz, methanol gas flow rate 11.0 mL/min, and H2 flow rate 80\u2013180 mL/min, the reaction of the CH3OH/H2 DBD plasma gave a methanol conversion close to 30% and a selectivity for EG of more than 75%. The change of the EG yield correlated with the intensity of the H\u03b1 spectral line. H atoms appear to be the catalytically active species in the reaction. In the DBD plasma, the stable ground state H2 molecule undergoes cumulative collision excitation with electrons before transitioning from higher energy excited states to the first excited state. The spontaneous dissociation of the first excited state H2 molecules generates the catalytically active H atom. The discharge reaction condition affects the catalytic performance of H2 by influencing the dissociation of H2 molecules into H atoms. The catalytic effect of H2 exhibited in the non-equilibrium plasma may be a new opportunity for the synthesis of chemicals.",

It was found that the order of activities for CH4, CO and NO conversion was Cat3 \u2248 Cat2 > Cat1, where Cat3 had the lowest light-off temperature (T50) for CO (114 \u00b0C) and NO (149 \u00b0C), the lowest complete conversion temperature (T90) for CH4 (398 \u00b0C) and CO (179 \u00b0C), and the lowest \u0394T (T90\u2013T50) for CH4 (34 \u00b0C) and CO (65 \u00b0C).

XRD results demonstrated that the additive cation (Zr4+) was incorporated into the CeO2\u2013ZrO2 lattice, thus creating a higher concentration of defects and improving the O2-mobility. XPS results showed that the Cat3 had the highest Ce3+/Ce ratio, suggesting the presence of a significant quantity of oxygen vacancies and cerium in the Ce3+ state.

     "abstract": "Acidic, basic and neutral ionic liquids (ILs) have been used as catalysts in the carbonylation of glycerol with urea. The results show that neutral ILs have high catalytic activity in the reaction. The excellent performance of the catalysts can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the cation and anion. We speculated that the cation with positive charge activates urea, and the anion with negative charge activates glycerol. In addition, the well balanced acid-basic properties of the catalysts are necessary for good catalytic performance. The ILs can be reused at least five times without loss of activity. Using ILs, instead of the traditional metal catalysts, reduces the use of non-renewable resources. It is eco-friendly that two inexpensive and bio-based raw materials were used and the catalytic reaction was carried out without solvent.",

The immobilized catalyst was found to be highly reactive in the epoxidation of a wide range of alkenes, including linear, cyclic, and aromatic alkenes. The immobilized catalyst exhibited a higher catalytic activity for alkene epoxidation than homogeneous Mo. In contrast experiments, it was determined that the salen structure played an important role in immobilizing MoO(O2)2(DMF)2 and improving the conversion and efficiency of alkene epoxidation, which could not be obtained using other ligands, such as the N atom as a single ligand. Furthermore, the bonding between Mo and the salen ligands and the possible mechanism of alkene epoxidation catalyzed by the catalyst were determined. The catalyst could be reused several times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Given that halloysite nanotubes are cheap and easy to obtain, this catalyst offers a novel alternative for the rational design of catalysts with desired features.",

Microcalorimetric adsorption results showed that the presence of small amount of pre-adsorbed water (4% coverage) enhanced the adsorption of acetone while inhibited the adsorption of IPA on Ni, which might be the important reasons for the promotion effect of some water on the hydrogenation of acetone to IPA. On the other hand, the heats for the adsorption of H2, acetone and IPA on the Ni/MgAlO were significantly decreased when more water was pre-adsorbed, which might explain the inhibition effect of more water on the hydrogenation of acetone.

In situ combustion is one of the most promising strategies for heavy oil exploitation, and the modulating of the oxidation behavior of heavy oil is an efficient way to expand the applicability of the in situ combustion method. MnO2 nanoparticles were employed to facilitate the cracking of heavy compounds, promote heat production, and improve recovery efficiency. The oxidative decomposition rate of heavy oil was doubled in the low temperature interval, and the heat release rate was accelerated in the high temperature interval. The increased weight loss at low temperature was attributed to the decomposition of heavy components. The detection of incomplete oxidation products by mass spectroscopy under excessive oxygen flow at high temperature indicated a diffusion controlled process of oil combustion. The same amount of CO2 from the combustion of less fuel demonstrated an increased oxidation degree of the products. The apparent activation energies of the oxidation reactions were decreased by 10\u201330 kJ/mol at low temperature and 20\u201340 kJ/mol at high temperature by the addition of MnO2.

In this study, we elucidated the ORR pathway on a series of carbon-supported manganese oxides, which have been extensively studied as electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes. A comparison of the turnover frequencies of the HODR and HORR showed that although an apparent four-electron transfer process was identified when the HO2\u2212 yield was measured using the rotating ring disk electrode technique, the real ORR pathway involved a two-electron transfer process to generate HO2\u2212, with subsequent chemical decomposition of HO2\u2212.

The effects of the preparation and reduction conditions and the Pt loading level on structural properties and performance during HCHO oxidation were then studied based on the assessment of adsorbed species on the catalyst surfaces using in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The results indicated that Pt/P25 prepared by DP and reduced with HCHO exhibited homogeneously dispersed Pt nanoparticles with appropriate particle size in addition to a high concentration of chemisorbed oxygen, and also showed high activity for HCHO oxidation. A HCHO conversion of 98% with stable performance over more than 100 h was achieved over Pt/P25 produced using DP and HCHO reduction at 30 \u00b0C, even with a 0.4% Pt loading. Pt/P25 synthesized using DP with H2 reduction was less effective at promoting formate decomposition and thus showed less HCHO oxidation activity, likely because of lower levels of chemisorbed oxygen. The Pt/P25 made using IM and H2 reduction had the highest amount of chemisorbed oxygen but also the largest Pt particles, resulting in the lowest activity for both the formation of formate species and formate decomposition into CO species, and thus showed low HCHO oxidation activity.",

     "abstract": "The selective catalytic reduction of NOx by H2 (H2-SCR) was studied over Pt/MgO, Pt/\u03b3-Al2O3, Pt/ZrO2, and Pt/HZSM-5 catalysts. The H2-SCR activities and N2 selectivities of the catalysts were strongly influenced by the amounts of Pt metal in the catalysts and the NOx adsorption capacities of the supports. The acidic surface of HZSM-5 increased the amount of metallic Pt on the support, decreasing the NOx adsorption capacity, resulting in much higher H2-SCR activity and N2 selectivity. The inferior activities of Pt/MgO and Pt/\u03b3-Al2O3 are ascribed to the low amounts of metallic Pt and large NOx adsorption capacities of the supports as a result of their basic surfaces. Based on these results and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic studies of the reaction, it is proposed that the reduction products of nitrite/nitrate species at the Pt/support interface are N2 or N2O, depending on the relative amounts of active hydrogen and nitrous species involved in the reduction.",

The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms showed that the microporosity exhibited by the aluminophosphate was changed to a mesoporous and macroporous structure which depended on the metal incorporated, with a concomitant change in the surface area. Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 revealed that the materials possessed both acidic and basic sites. The acidic strength of the material was either increased or decreased depending on the nature of the metal. The basicity was increased compared to AlP. All the materials were X-ray amorphous and powder X-ray diffraction studies indicated the absence of metal oxide phases. The Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed the presence of phosphate groups and also the absence of any M-O moieties in the materials. The selected organic reaction occurred only in the presence of the AlP and MAlPs. The selectivity for the jasminaldehyde product was up to 75% with a yield of 65%.

The investigation into N2 selectivity focused on three key elementary steps: gaseous N2O formation, subsequent re-adsorption, and N\u2013O bond scission to produce N2. In these steps, Rh1, Pd1, and Pt1/CeO2(111) exhibit a higher selectivity, whereas the other systems (Zr1, Tc1, Ru1) TM1/CeO2 show a lower selectivity. The higher selectivity displayed by Pt1, Pd1, and Rh1 dopants arises from the availability of valence d electrons, which permit the formation of strong chemical bonds with the reactants and intermediates. Calculated results agree well with experimental findings, and the insights gained can be used to guide the rational design of the doped oxides for catalysis.",

The current understanding and enlightenment from foundation and development of ammonia synthesis catalyst are reviewed, and its future and facing new challenge remained today are expected. Catalytic ammonia synthesis technology has played a central role in the development of the chemical industry during the 20th century. During 100 years, ammonia synthesis catalyst has come through diversified seedtime such as Fe3O4-based iron catalysts, Fe1-xO-based iron catalysts, ruthenium-based catalysts, and discovery of a Co-Mo-N system. Often new techniques, methods, and theories of catalysis have initially been developed and applied in connection with studies of this system. Similarly, new discoveries in the field of ammonia synthesis have been extended to other fields of catalysis. There is no other practically relevant reaction that leads to such a close interconnection between theory, model catalysis, and experiment as the high-pressure synthesis of ammonia. Catalytic synthesis ammonia reaction is yet a perfect model system for academic research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the mechanism and the translation of the knowledge into technical perfection has become a fundamental criterion for scientific development in catalysis research. The never-ending story has not ended yet. In addition to questions about the elementary steps of the reaction and the importance of the real structure and subnitrides for the catalyst efficiency, as well as the wide-open question about new catalyst materials, there are also different challenges thrown down by theory for the experimentalist in the prediction of a biomimetic ammonia-synthesis path at room temperature and atmospheric pressure including electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and biomimetic nitrogen fixation.",

The catalyst was prepared according to a previously published literature procedure using inexpensive and readily available starting materials, and subsequently characterized by FT-IR, UV and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, as well as microanalysis. The results showed that {Mo132} exhibited high catalytic activity towards the synthesis of 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles, with the desired products being formed in good to high yields. Furthermore, the catalyst was recyclable and could be reused at least three times without any discernible loss in its catalytic activity. Overall, this new catalytic method for the synthesis of 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles provides rapid access to the desired compounds following a simple work-up procedure, and avoids the use of harmful organic solvents. This method therefore represents a significant improvement over the methods currently available for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted imidazoles.",

The catalytic activity is closely related to the Mn loading, and the AgMn/HZ catalyst with 2.4 wt% Mn (AgMn/HZ(2.4)) had the highest activity and stability in benzene oxidation as a result of its large surface area and high MnOx dispersion. Temperature-programmed desorption of the used catalysts demonstrated that 2.4 wt% was also the optimal Mn loading for suppressing the accumulation of benzene and HCOOH over the catalyst surface after benzene oxidation. For AgMn/HZ catalysts with Mn loadings \u2264 2.4 wt%, O3 decomposition to active oxygen species (O*) plays the most important role in benzene oxidation; however, benzene activation is the crucial step for benzene oxidation by O3 over AgMn/HZ catalysts with Mn loadings > 2.4 wt%.

The aim was to establish the disinfection efficiency of solid TiO2 compared with that of suspended catalysts, widely considered as reference cases for photocatalytic water disinfection. The bacterial inactivation profiles obtained showed that: (1) the photoinactivation was exclusively related to the quantity of photons retained per unit of treated volume, irrespective of the characteristics of the photocatalyst and the emitted light flux densities; (2) across the whole UV light range studied, each of the photocatalytic solids was able to achieve more than 2 log bacterial inactivation with less than 2 h UV irradiation; (3) none of the used catalysts achieved a total bacterial disinfection during the treatment time.

The modification of CeO2 by MnOx further enhanced the catalytic performance. Ethane conversion of 94% and ethylene selectivity of 69% were obtained after 2 h of reaction at 723 K over an 8 wt% MnOx\u2013CeO2 catalyst. This catalyst was stable and the ethylene yield could be sustained at 65%\u201370% over 100 h of reaction.

Pd-Ce(2.0)/La-Al2O3 catalyst (where 2.0 is the wt% of CeO2) exhibited the highest catalytic activity for HC and NO eliminations. Following aging at 1100 \u00b0C, the operational window for HC and NOx conversions was broadened and the thermal stability of the catalysts was also improved as a result of the presence of an appropriate quantity of ceria (2.0\u20134.0 wt%). The enhanced interactions between PdOx and CeO2 evidently led to the formation of a Pd-O-Ce system, stabilizing PdOx species with smaller particle sizes at high temperatures.

The catalytic performances of these perovskites were compared with that of a 2 wt% Pt/SiO2 catalyst. The La site substitution increased the catalytic properties for NO or C10H22 oxidation compared with the non-substituted LaMnO3 sample. For the most efficient perovskite catalyst, (La0.8Sr0.2)MnO3, the results showed the presence of two temperature domains for NO adsorption: (1) a domain corresponding to weakly adsorbed NO, desorbing at temperatures lower than 270 \u00b0C and (2) a second domain corresponding to NO adsorbed on the surface as nitrate species, desorbing at temperatures higher than 330 \u00b0C. For the Sr-substituted perovskite, the maximum NO2 yield of 80% was observed in the intermediate temperature domain (around 285 \u00b0C). In the reactant mixture of NO/C10H22/O2/H2O/He, (La0.8Sr0.2)MnO3 perovskite showed better performance than the 2 wt% Pt/SiO2 catalyst: NO2 yields reaching 50% and 36% at 290 and 370 \u00b0C, respectively. This activity improvement was found to be because of atomic scale interactions between the A and B active sites, Sr2+ cation and Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couple.

The results show that CO can strongly adsorb on the top site of the Au nanoparticle with an adsorption energy of \u223c1.2 eV, while the adsorption of NO on both the Au nanoparticle and the interface between the nanoparticle and the CeO2 support is generally much weaker. However, at the interface, formation of the N2O2 dimer followed by cleavage of the terminal N\u2013O bond is an effective way to decompose NOx. For the complete process, the first step of the CO + N2O2 reaction can readily occur in Langmuir-Hinshelwood mode with an activation energy of only \u223c0.4 eV, leading to the formation of N2O and CO2 via an intermediate ONNOCO species. In contrast, the second step to eliminate N2O requires a rather high energy barrier of \u223c1.8 eV through a Eley-Rideal type collision reaction. Further analyses show that the unique electronic properties of Ce can induce the electron transfer and localization from supported Au to surface Ce cations, which then promotes the formation of negatively charged N2O2. Moreover, the structural flexibility of the Au nanoparticle also facilitates the adsorbed CO to approach and react with N2O2 at the interface.",

However, the practical application of conventional oxide photocatalysts is restricted by poor visible light adsorption because of their wide band gaps. The study of photocatalysts with a narrow band gap is thus a hot topic. Among oxide photocatalysts, Bi-based photocatalysts have attracted much interest because of their high visible light photocatalytic activity. This review summarizes recent advances into the type, preparation method, morphology control, composite construction, and properties of Bi-based photocatalysts. Finally, this review ends with a discussion on the future development of Bi-based photocatalysts in this exciting research area.",

     "abstract": "S-doped TiO2 (S-TiO2) films were immobilized on flexible low-cost aluminum sheets (S-TiO2-AS) using a sol-gel dipping process and low post-processing temperatures. The photocatalytic degradation of toxic organic vapors using the prepared films was evaluated using a continuous-flow glass tube under visible light exposure. The surface properties of the S-TiO2-AS and TiO2-AS films were examined by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The photolysis of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX) did not occur on the bare AS. In contrast, the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of the target pollutants using S-TiO2-AS were higher than those obtained using reference TiO2-AS photocatalyst. In particular, the average photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of BTEX using S-TiO2-0.8-AS (S/Ti ratio = 0.8) over a 3-h process were 34%, 78%, 91%, and 94%, respectively, whereas those of TiO2-AS were 2%, 11%, 21%, and 36%, respectively. The photocatalytic decomposition efficiencies of BTEX under visible irradiation using S-TiO2-AS increased with increasing S/Ti ratios from 0.2 to 0.8, but decreased when the ratio further increased to 1.6. Thus, S-TiO2-AS can be prepared using optimal S/Ti ratios. The degradation of BTEX over S-TiO2-AS depended on the air flow rates and initial concentrations of the target chemical. Overall, under optimal conditions, S-TiO2-AS can be effectively applied for the purification of toxic organic vapors.",

The materials were either synthesized from the sulfur-containing polymers or obtained by heat treatment of commercial carbon with hydrogen sulfide. Their surface was extensively characterized from the points of view of its surface chemistry, porosity, morphology, and electronic properties. The carbons showed enhanced activity towards oxidation of arsine and removal of dibenzothiophenes from model diesel fuel. The latter were oxidized to various oxygen containing intermediates and the cleavage of C\u2013C bonds in aromatic ring was detected when carbon with adsorbed species was exposed to UV or visible light. Irradiation resulted in generation of photocurrent in a broad range of wavelength. The presence of sulfur led to the reduction of oxygen and contributed to an increased capacitive performance. We link these effects to the presence of reduced sulfur in the small pores which enhances the dispersive interactions via inducing a positive charge to carbon atoms, to sulfur in oxygenated forms which contribute to Faradaic reactions and increase the polar interactions, and to the hydrophobicity of a surface in small pores where oxygen can be reduced by excited electrons from chromophoric-like sulfur containing groups.",

We demonstrated a selective way to make defects in the outer tube by the fluorination of DWCNTs followed by the thermal detachment of the F atoms at 1000 \u00b0C in argon. Fluorinated DWCNTs with different amounts of F atoms were prepared by reacting with fluorine gas at 25, 200, and 400 \u00b0C that gave the stoichiometry of CF0.20, CF0.30, and CF0.43, respectively. At the three different temperatures used, we observed preservation of the coaxial morphology in the fluorinated DWCNTs. For the DWCNTs fluorinated at 25 and 200 \u00b0C, the strong radial breathing modes (RBMs) of the inner tube and weakened RBMs of the outer tube indicated selective fluorine attachment onto the outer tube. However, the disappearance of the RBMs in the Raman spectrum of the DWCNTs fluorinated at 400 \u00b0C showed the introduction of F atoms onto both inner and outer tubes. There was no significant change in the morphology and optical properties when the DWCNTs fluorinated at 25 and 200 \u00b0C were thermally treated at 1000 \u00b0C in argon. However, in the case of the DWCNTs fluorinated at 400 \u00b0C, the recovery of strong RBMs from the inner tube and weakened RBMs from the outer tube indicated the selective introduction of substantial defects on the outer tube while preserving the original tubular shape. The thermal detachment of F atoms from fluorinated DWCNTs is an efficient way to make highly defective outer tubes for preserving the electrical conduction and optical activity of the inner tubes.",

It is investigated how these parameters influence the structural and morphological characteristics of the carbon materials obtained as well as their nanostructure. It is shown that it is possible to maintain after graphitization the round-shaped macro morphology, a high surface area and porosity, and especially a large structural disorder in the graphitic layers stacking, with the presence of rather small ordered domains. These are characteristics interesting for various catalytic applications. The key in obtaining these characteristics is the thermal treatment in a flow of N2. It was demonstrated that the use of He rather than N2 does not allow obtaining the same results. The effect is attributed to the presence of traces of oxygen, enough to create the presence of oxygen functional groups on the surface temperatures higher than 750 \u00b0C, when graphitization occurs.

These N-doped graphene are excellent catalysts in the oxidation of ethylbenzene. A high yield of acetonphenone did not depend on the total nitrogen amount but only on the type of nitrogen species. Too much defects and N-dopants were detrimental to this reaction. A proper activation of the oxidant is needed to get good catalytic activity.",

The presence of Mg-Al hydrotalcite (HT, Mg/Al molar ratio = 3/1) as a base afforded higher selective oxidation of HMF to 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) than with the bases MgO, Ca(OH)2 and NaOH owing to its appropriate strength of basicity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization confirmed that metallic Ru0 species were the active sites for HMF oxidation. Isotopic tracer experiments conducted with 18O2 and 16O2 indicated that H2O rather than O2 provided the oxygen atom for the oxidation of HMF to FFCA and FDCA via hydration of the formyl group. These results and kinetic studies of the oxidation of HMF and 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) led to the proposition that the aerobic oxidation of HMF to FFCA follows a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The oxidation involved dissociative adsorption of HMF and O2 to form adsorbed alcoholate and atomic oxygen species followed by kinetically relevant abstraction of \u03b2-H from the alcoholate species via the atomic oxygen species to adsorbed DFF species on the Ru surface, which then underwent hydration and oxidation to FFCA under basic conditions.",

These phenomena can be limited by modification of Ru/AC and Pt/AC with Au improving the durability of the catalyst. Ru/AC and AuRu/AC showed good selectivity to the corresponding aldehyde (>95%) making these catalysts promising for fragrances manufacturing. The advantage in using Au modified catalyst lies on the easier regeneration procedure compared to the one necessary for Ru/AC.

In this article, three methods, i.e., direct impregnation, homogeneous oxidative precipitation with hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia-catalyzed hydrolysis, were applied to synthesize iron, cobalt, and nickel metal oxide nanoparticles supported on graphene. The influence of the three deposition methods on particle size distribution was investigated. Transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the morphology and structure of the catalysts. The highest dispersion and the most uniform particle size distribution were obtained by the hydrogen peroxide homogeneous oxidative precipitation method. Hydrogen peroxide favors the maximization of the oxygen-containing groups on graphenes, thereby providing sufficient absorption and nucleation sites to give a high dispersion of nanoparticles. In contrast, ammonia accelerates the nucleation speed and results in the largest particle size and inhomogeneity. The catalytic properties of the graphene-supported metal oxide nanoparticles were tested with the oxidation of benzyl alcohol as a probe reaction. The reaction activity decreased in the following order: catalysts prepared by hydrogen peroxide-assisted deposition > direct impregnation > ammonia-catalyzed hydrolysis. The decrease in reaction activity was consistent with the order of increasing catalyst particle sizing shown in transmission electron microscopy images. The catalytic relevance of the particle size showed a necessity for the development of effective methods for size-controlled nanocatalyst synthesis on graphenes.",

A Cu-ZnO catalyst was also prepared by homogeneous coprecipitation (CZ-HP) for reference. X-ray diffraction results showed that the degree of mixing of Cu2+, Zn2+, and Al3+ ions in the Cu-Zn-Al hydroxycarbonate precursor followed the order of CZA-DP < CZA-HP < CZA-CP. A more homogeneous aluminum distribution and intimate contact between Al2O3 and ZnO led to smaller CuO and ZnO crystallites in the CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 composite oxides, and consequently smaller Cu and ZnO crystallites in the final Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts. However, the intimate ZnO-Al2O3 contact hindered the interaction between Cu and ZnO in the Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts. As a result of these effects of Al2O3, for the samples other than CZA-CP, the Cu particles on CZA-HP showed the highest redox activity, which was characterized by N2O chemisorption-H2 temperature-programmed reduction. These catalysts catalyzed glycerol hydrogenolysis to propylene glycol with high selectivities above 90% at 30% glycerol conversion (473 K and 6.0 MPa H2). Their activities normalized per exposed surface Cu atom to give turnover frequencies increased in the order CZA-DP < CZA-CP < CZ-HP < CZA-HP, which was the order of the redox ability of the Cu particles. The addition of alumina increased the stability of Cu-ZnO catalysts. After six cycles (6 h per run), the activity of CZ-HP decreased by 45% accompanied by an increase of Cu crystallite size from 13.2 to 45.2 nm, while that of CZA-HP decreased only by 10% with an increase of the Cu crystallite size from 8.3 to 19.0 nm. These results demonstrated the promoting effects of Al2O3 on the activity and stability of Cu-ZnO catalysts derived from the hydroxycarbonates.",

The resultant materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption. The results indicated that the Ru species in ZSM-5 catalysts prepared via the latter approach (designated as Ru/ZSM-5-TF) were highly dispersed in the ZSM-5 framework structure and this material exhibited high catalytic performance during the hydrogenation of D-glucose to D-sorbitol. The conversion of D-glucose was as high as 99.6% with D-sorbitol selectivity reaching 99.2%, exceeding the performance of Ru/ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by the conventional impregnation method with microporous or desilicated ZSM-5 supports. More importantly, this catalyst showed high stability against leaching and poisoning and could be reused several times. The extensive dispersion of the Ru species, strong interaction between the Ru species and the ZSM-5, and the suitable surface acidity-basicity balance of the Ru/ZSM-5-TF were all critical factors leading to excellent catalytic behavior and stability.",

In the present study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the activation of the C\u2013H bond of methane on the (001) and (011) planes of Co3O4, which showed that CH4 activation on Co3O4 nanocrystals was fairly easy with only small energy barriers (less than 1.1 eV).

Residual gas within the carbon papers was eliminated, and PTFE evenly infused within the pores. Cross-sections of the carbon papers indicated that vacuum treatment improved PTFE distribution. The same PTFE content resulted in a decreased water contact angle of the carbon paper because of the greater PTFE content within the micropores. The proportions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic pores within the carbon papers were investigated. The proportion of hydrophobic pores increased during the vacuum treatment. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were fabricated using the treated hydrophobic carbon papers as gas diffusion layers and were evaluated in a full-sized fuel cell.

First, cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the redox properties of the modified electrode at various scan rates. Next, the mediated oxidation of IP at the modified electrode is described. At the optimum pH of 7.0, the oxidation of IP occurs at a potential about 90 mV less than that of an unmodified carbon paste electrode. Based on the results of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the oxidation of IP showed a dynamic range between 10 and 6000 \u03bcmol/L, and a detection limit of 1.24 \u00b5mol/L. Finally, DPV was used to simultaneously determine the concentrations of IP, UA, and FA in solution at the modified electrode.",

In this paper, seven different acidic ILs were examined as catalysts in the synthesis of biodiesel from the esterification of oleic acid with methanol. It was found that the stronger the acidity of the IL, the higher its esterification activity. The introduction of a SO3H group into the IL greatly increases its Br\u00f6nsted acidity and results in a bifunctional nature of the ILs for use as either a catalyst or environmentally-friendly solution in the esterification reaction. All of these effects contribute to product formation. Of all the tested acidic ILs, 1-sulfobutyl-3-methylimidazoliumhydrosulfate ([BHSO3MIM]HSO4) exhibited the best catalytic performance. The [BHSO3MIM]HSO4-catalyzed esterification of oleic acid with methanol was systematically explored, and the reaction conditions were optimized using a response surface methodology. The optimum molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid, catalyst amount, reaction temperature, and reaction time were 4:1, 10% (based on the mass of oleic acid), 130 \u00b0C, and 4 h, respectively, under these conditions, and a yield of methyl oleate (biodiesel) of 97.7% was achieved. Furthermore, [BHSO3MIM]HSO4 retained around 95.6% of its original catalytic activity after 10 successive reuses (4 h per period of use), showing excellent operational stability. In addition, the use of [BHSO3MIM]HSO4 for biodiesel synthesis from waste oils containing 72% of free fatty acids was examined, and yields as high as 94.9% after 6 h were obtained.

Our experimental results show conclusively that methanol has no effect on photocatalytic water splitting with water covered rutile TiO2(110)-(1 \u00d7 1) surface. Further experimental results also show that water does not affect the process of photocatalytic methanol dissociation but does suppress photo-induced desorption of the formaldehyde product of methanol photocatalysis and can enhance the formation of the methyl formate product.",

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the Pt-TiO2 film was carried out to assess the electronic states of the Pt nanoparticles and accumulated organic species. The deconvoluted C 1s and O 1s XPS spectra revealed that the content of carbonyl and carboxyl groups on Pt-TiO2 and degree of catalyst deactivation in the systems studied decreased in the following order: UV254 nm > O3+UV254 nm > UV254+185 nm. Metallic Pt0 was oxidized to a mixture of PtOads and Pt4+ species under O3+UV254 nm and UV254+185 nm irradiation owing to the presence of O3 and hydroxyl radicals, but remained stable under UV254 nm irradiation. Pt species at higher oxidation states can act as electron trapping centers, and improve the photocatalytic activity of Pt-TiO2 and provide reactive sites for O3 decomposition under UV irradiation, resulting in a faster O3 removal rate than that displayed by TiO2. The XPS studies provided valuable information to elucidate the beneficial role of Pt species and the reduction of catalyst deactivation under UV254+185 nm irradiation.",

Catalysts with various WO3 loading (4% to 10%) were prepared by impregnation and tested for the metathesis of ethene and trans-2-butene. Ion exchange of NaOH onto the WO3/SiO2 catalyst was used to mitigate the acidity of the catalysts in a controlled way. At low WO3 loading, the treatment with large amounts of NaOH resulted in a significant decrease in metathesis activity concomitant with significant W leaching and marked structural changes (XRD, Raman). At higher WO3 loading (6% to 10%), the treatment with NaOH mainly resulted in a decrease in acidity. FT-IR experiments after adsorption of pyridine showed that the Lewis acidic sites were poisoned by sodium. Nevertheless, the metathesis activity remained constant after the NaOH treatment. This suggested that the remaining acidity on the catalyst was enough to ensure the efficient formation of the carbene active sites. Interestingly, Na poisoning resulted in some modification of the selectivity. The mitigation of acidity was shown to favor propene selectivity over the formation of isomerization products (cis-2-butene, 1-butene, etc.). Moreover, treatment with NaOH led to a shorter induction period and reduced coke formation on the WO3/SiO2 catalyst.",

     "abstract": "Wet air oxidation (WAO), a liquid phase reaction between organic materials in water and oxygen, is one of the most economical and technologically viable advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment, particularly toxic and high organic content wastewater. WAO is the liquid phase oxidation of organics or oxidizable inorganic components at elevated temperatures (125\u2013320\u00b0C) and pressures (0.5\u201320 MPa) using gaseous oxygen (or air) as oxidant. In the past two decades, the WAO process was widely studied and applied in the treatment of dye wastewater. Compared to conventional WAO, catalytic WAO processes have higher efficiency and use moderate reaction conditions. The catalysts included homogenous and heterogeneous types. The key points that need to be solved are recycling of homogenous catalysts and better stability of heterogeneous catalysts. In the present review, the technological processes are first introduced, then some research history and hotspots of WAO research are presented, and finally, its application in the treatment of dye wastewater in the past two decades is summarized to reveal the impressive changes in modes, trends, and conditions used. The application includes model pollutant studies and wastewater tests.",

The active component, Ni, was loaded on the as-synthesized composite oxides, producing supported Ni catalysts for catalytic partial oxidation of methane to syngas. The properties of the as-synthesized products, such as textural structure, reduction behavior, surface acidity, and carbon deposition, were determined using N2 physical adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction by H2, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, and thermogravimetric analysis. The effects of catalyst composition, calcination temperature, and reaction time on the catalytic performance were investigated. The characterization results showed that these Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalysts have large surface area, small CeO2 crystals, weak acidity, and low carbon deposition. Highly dispersed NiO is present and is easy to be reduced. The Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst with a Ce/Si molar ratio of 1:1, w(Ni) = 10%, and calcined at 700 \u00b0C exhibited good stability and the highest CH4 conversion (\u223c84%) and CO and H2 selectivity (> 87%).",

The hierarchical MCM-22-FC zeolite aggregates were constructed by intergrown and stacked thin MCM-22 lamellas and possessed macro-/mesopores and inherent micropores. The MCM-22-FC zeolite was modified to form the Mo/MCM-22-FC catalyst, which exhibited an improved benzene yield and aromatic selectivity as well as catalyst life in the methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) reaction. Based on NH3-TPD and pyridine-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements together with thermogravimetric analysis, we found that the improved MDA catalytic performance of Mo/MCM-22-FC resulted from the formation of more active MoCx or MoOxCy species that evolved from increased amounts of Br\u00f6nsted acids with the assistance of fluoride ions. This promoted the diffusion of large molecule products because of the thin MCM-22 lamellas. Less excess Br\u00f6nsted acid sites were retained in the Mo/HMCM-22-FC catalyst because the formation of active centers inhibited the formation of coke, which contributed to its improved aromatic selectivity",

The relationship between the catalyst structure and catalytic properties was investigated. The results indicated that the amounts of Mo6+, V5+ and Te4+ species on the catalyst surface were adjusted, and oxidation activity of the catalyst increased, as a result of doping with an appropriate amount Cr, which promoted propane activation. The acid strength became weaker, and the number of acid sites on the catalyst surface decreased, which suppressed AA oxidation and improved the selectivity for AA.",

The curves of differential heats of adsorption versus coverage (calorimetric curves) were simultaneously measured with a microcalorimeter, which showed that a simple interpretation of the adsorption isotherms would be incorrect. The calorimetric curves showed sharp drops, and the coverages at which these occurred were taken as the saturation amounts of adsorbed methanol and dimethyl ether on regular sites. However, beyond the saturation coverage, the adsorption isotherms still showed increasing coverages, which were attributed to adsorption on weaker sites, and which should not be used during curve fitting to get the Langmuir parameters of the adsorption isotherm for the regular adsorption sites. In the absence of the calorimetric data, these regions would have been assumed to be part of the adsorption isotherm for the regular adsorption sites, which would be erroneous. To account for the existence of another weaker adsorption site which continued to be populated at high pressures, in addition to the regular adsorption site, we used the dual-site Langmuir equation with the saturation amount on the regular adsorption site obtained from the calorimetric curves. This gave good fits also in the high pressure region where adsorption mainly occurred on the weaker sites.",

It was found that the lignin component in the JAS had little effect on the conversion of hemicellulose while the water-soluble substances caused a negative effect, which led to an EG yield of only 29.9%. After a simple hot water pretreatment, most of the water-soluble substances were removed, and the EG yield was increased to 37.6%. Moreover, the hot water pretreatment also led to an improvement in the durability of the catalyst. The effects of reaction temperature and reaction duration were also investigated.",

     "abstract": "Among several typical zeolites, H-ZSM-34 was found to be an efficient catalyst for the conversion of methyl chloride to lower olefins, i.e., ethylene, propylene, and butenes. Treatment of H-ZSM-34 with a Na2H2EDTA (EDTA = ethylenediaminetetraacetate) aqueous solution followed by ion exchange and calcination enhanced the catalytic performance significantly. The selectivity to lower olefins increased significantly for certain Na2H2EDTA aqueous solution concentrations; when the H-ZSM-34 catalyst was treated with a 0.1 mol/L Na2H2EDTA solution, the selectivity and yield of C2\u2013C4 olefins reached 82% and 61%, respectively, at 673 K and a CH3Cl partial pressure of 9.2 kPa. The modification of H-ZSM-34 with Ce ions improved C2\u2013C4 olefin selectivity and yield. Catalyst characterization suggests that treatment with Na2H2EDTA or modification by Ce decreases the acidity of H-ZSM-34. The weakened acidity of the treated or modified H-ZSM-34 may suppress the hydrogen transfer reaction and prevent lower olefins from further transformation to paraffins.",

The process is catalyzed by an earth-abundant and robust Cu-based metal oxide catalyst, in which the high performance of the Cu catalyst for the in situ generation of H2 gas in the system by highly selective decomposition of FA in an aqueous medium is essential. The activity test results showed that a synergy effect of well-dispersed Cu and amphoteric ZrO2 is essential for FA decomposition as well as for glycerol conversion to 1,2-PDO. The Cu content of the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst prepared by the oxalate gel method has a significant role in the FA-mediated glycerol conversion to 1,2-PDO, and a Cu content of 20 wt% on ZrO2 was identified as the optimum Cu content. Moreover, the creation and maintenance of high component dispersion is essential for high glycerol hydrogenolysis activity of the Cu/ZrO2 system. Because selective hydrogenolysis with minimum use of external fossil-fuel H2 is a critical issue in the realization of biorefinery concepts, the procedure described here is expected to be of broad applicability in biomass use.",

     "abstract": "Using first-principle methods, we have shown that formaldehyde can be selectively converted to CO2 over In2O3(110). The OH generated from the splitting of water was found to assist in the dehydrogenation of formaldehyde to give the corresponding formyl (CHO) species. Rather than direct dehydrogenation, a hydrogen atom from the CHO was then removed by a neighboring OH to produce CO. Finally, in favoring of desorption, the CO seized a lattice O atom to yield CO2. Our calculation results indicate that In2O3 plays an important role in terms of selectivity during the methanol steam reforming reaction without the participation of the PdIn alloy, confirming the experimentally observed selectivity towards CO2.",

It is found that the decomposition of glycerol on Ru/ZrO2 and Rh/ZrO2 proceeds through a dehydration-hydrogenation mechanism. The formation of 1,2-PDO is thermodynamically favored, and the activity of the Ru-based catalyst is higher than that of the Rh-based one. In contrast, a direct hydrogenolysis mechanism is proposed for the Re-modified Rh and Ir catalysts, in which a dissociated H atom on the Rh(Ir) metal surface attacks the C\u2013O bond neighboring the alkoxide species on the ReOx cluster. In the presence of ReOx-Rh/ZrO2, the modified catalyst favors the production of 1,2-PDO, and 1,3-PDO production becomes competitive. However, the ReOx-Ir/ZrO2 catalyst significantly improves 1,3-PDO selectivity. The direct hydrogenolysis pathway, as opposed to the indirect hydrogenolysis mechanism for monometallic catalysts, may be the key to the high 1,3-PDO selectivity on the modified catalysts, where the hydroxylated Re group facilitates the formation of terminal alkoxide species rather than secondary alkoxides. Steric effects are important in preferential terminal alkoxide formation on the ReOx-Ir/ZrO2 catalysts because of the growth of large Ir-Re clusters, resulting in high selectivity for 1,3-PDO.",

     "abstract": "Although many water-related catalytic reactions on Cu-ZnO catalysts, such as methanol steam reforming and water gas shift, have been extensively investigated, little is known about water dissociation on Cu-ZnO catalysts. To reveal the active center for water dissociation on Cu-ZnO catalysts, we performed density functional theory calculations on various domains of Cu-ZnO catalysts, including Cu surfaces, supported ZnO films, and Cu-ZnO interfaces. It is found that water dissociation is hindered by a relatively large energy barrier on both the planar and the stepped Cu surfaces. On supported ZnO films, the barrier of water dissociation is significantly lowered compared with the Cu surfaces and the reaction is essentially thermo-neutral, thus the dissociation reaction will easily reach a state of dynamic equilibrium and dissociative and molecular water can coexist on the film. At the Cu-ZnO interface, water dissociation is exothermic and proceeds essentially without an energy barrier. The enhanced activity of the Cu-ZnO interface is due to the strong adsorption of both the H atom and hydroxyl group, and the step-like structure at the interface. The low energy barrier of hydroxyl diffusion and water-assisted hydrogen diffusion on ZnO films allows water dissociation to occur continuously at the interface. This work highlights the unique role of the Cu-ZnO interface in water dissociation on Cu-ZnO catalysts.",

For reference, a Ni-free Pd/Pencil/Al2O3 membrane was also fabricated. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the membranes were studied by scanning electron microscopy and metallographic microscopy. The hydrogen permeation kinetics was investigated by single gas tests, and the hydrogen separation performances of the Pd/Pencil/Al2O3 and Pd/Pencil/NiO/Al2O3 membranes were tested with a hydrogen feed composed of H2 77.8%, CO 5.2%, CO2 13.5%, and CH4 3.5%. The Ni-free Pd/Pencil/Al2O3 membrane only shows function of hydrogen separation, while the Pd/Pencil/Ni/Al2O3 is also catalytically effective for methanation of CO and CO2 in hydrogen, forming a bifunctional palladium membrane concept. Since the amount of CO and CO2 in the hydrogen after membrane separation is very low, the consumption of hydrogen by the methanation reactions is negligible. The bifunctional membrane is promising for proton exchange membrane fuel cells because the catalytic methanation treatment solves the CO poisoning problem of the fuel cell electrodes and consequently allows the palladium membrane to tolerate more membrane defects and to achieve longer life.",

The maximum activity, 692\u00b112 U/mL, of the industrially important manganese peroxidase (MnP) enzyme was recorded after five days of still culture incubation. The crude MnP was 2.1-fold purified with a specific activity of 860 U/mg after purification on a Sephadex-G-100 gel column. On native and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis gels, the purified MnP fraction was a single homogenous band of 45 kDa. An active fraction of MnP was immobilized using hydrophobic sol-gel entrapment comprising tetramethoxysilane (T) and propyltrimethoxysilane (P) at different T:P molar ratios. Characterization revealed that after 24 h incubation at varying pH and temperatures, the MnP fraction immobilized at a T:P ratio of 1:2 in the sol-gel retained 82% and 75% of its original activity at pH 4 and 70\u00b0C, respectively.

A maximum of 100% decolorization was achieved for the different textile effluents within the shortest time period. A lower KM, higher Vmax, hyper-activation, and enhanced acidic and thermal resistance up to 70 \u00b0C were the novel catalytic features of the sol-gel immobilized MnP, suggesting that it may be a potential candidate for biotechnological applications particularly for textile bioremediation purposes.",

The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The introduction of NiO resulted in the formation of NiAl2O4 phase during calcination at 1373 K, reducing the proportion of small pores. Meanwhile, the presence of ZrO2 enhanced the sintering resistance of the coating, and moderate surface area was retained after calcination. The egg-shell distribution of Ru, thin layer thickness indicating short diffusion length, small proportion of nanosized pores (e.g., 1\u20134 nm), moderate specific surface area, and narrow pore size distribution to facilitate Ru dispersion are thought to be important factors controlling the behavior of the present monolithic catalysts.",

The results reveal that the catalytic performance of CNTs can be tuned by tuning the conjugation between CNT \u03c0 orbitals and the orbitals of the active CO groups. Through conjugation, CNTs act as an electron reservoir to donate or accept electrons from the CO group. We found that CO groups with a negative charge have higher C\u2013H bond activation activity but lead to a more stable i-propoxide intermediate, which inhibits the formation of propene, while positively charged CO groups have the opposite effect. The balance between the activities of the two C\u2013H activation steps can be obtained by tuning the charge of the CO group. This study increases the understanding of the origin of the activity of CNT catalysts at the microscopic scale and gives guidance for the preparation of high-performance CNT catalysts.",

     "abstract": "A series of bifunctional Ti-molecular sieves (M-TS-1, M = Al, B, or Fe) containing different trivalent ions (Al3+, B3+, or Fe3+), with MFI topology, were synthesized using tetrapropylammonium bromide, silica sol, and n-butylamine as a template, base, and Si source, respectively. The simultaneous presence of Ti and trivalent ions in lattice positions provided catalysts with activity in both oxidation and acid-catalyzed reactions. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The results showed that the numbers and strength of acid sites of TS-1 were enhanced by the incorporation of trivalent ions. Using selective oxidation of ethylene as the probe reaction, the catalytic properties of M-TS-1 were investigated. The results showed that Al-TS-1 and B-TS-1 had better catalytic properties; conversion and utilization of H2O2 reached 95% and 90%, respectively, and the yield of ethylene glycol plus its monomethyl ether was greater than 10%.",

This work used catalyst characterization and activity tests to investigate the roles of the HAP support and FeOx promoter in CO oxidation.

These reforming products served as reductants and promoters for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx over Ag/Al2O3. N2 adsorption-desorption, X-Ray powder diffraction, H2 temperature programmed reduction, and thermogravimetric analysis were performed for Ni-based catalysts. It was shown that an increase in the redox performance of Ni-based catalysts enhanced the H2 production from fuel reforming but decreased the amount of HCs available for further SCR reaction. The temperature window for NOx removal using the coupled system shifted to lower temperatures at the expense of the NOx conversion. An optimal ratio of H2/HCs was achieved using a Ni/ZrO2+Ag/Al2O3 dual catalyst system, which exhibited high activity for NOx conversion at typical diesel exhaust temperatures. Studies on the durability and performance of this Ni/ZrO2+Ag/Al2O3 coupled system were also performed, and the results showed that the lifetime of the reforming catalyst may limit the system and requires further improvement.",

The present work provides an effective combination of physical and chemical treatments to remove relatively high concentrations of non-biodegradable organic substances using a mesoporous photocatalyst.\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u6709\u5e8f\u4ecb\u5b54\u78b3-\u6c27\u5316\u949b\u5438\u9644-\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u9ad8\u6548\u964d\u89e3\u6c34\u4e2d\u82ef\u915a. \u4e3a\u53bb\u9664\u6c34\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u82ef\u915a,\u2005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5438\u9644-\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5faa\u73af,\u2005\u5373\u6697\u6761\u4ef6\u5438\u96448\u2005h,\u2005\u5206\u79bb\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u548c\u5c06\u56fa\u4f53\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7f6e\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e0b\u8f90\u71678\u2005h. \u7ecf\u8fc710\u6b21\u5faa\u73af,\u2005\u6c34\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u82ef\u915a(200\u2005mg/L)\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ef\u88ab\u5b8c\u5168\u964d\u89e3. \u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86TiO2\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u975e\u91d1\u5c5e\u63ba\u6742/\u4ecb\u5b54\u78b3\u58c1\u5bf9TiO2\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u805a\u96c6\u7684\u963b\u6291\u4f5c\u7528/\u4ecb\u5b54\u5b54\u9053\u5438\u9644\u82ef\u915a\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5438\u9644-\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u6709\u5e8f\u4ecb\u5b54\u78b3-\u6c27\u5316\u949b\u590d\u5408\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644\u548c\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u964d\u89e3\u6280\u672f,\u2005\u6709\u671b\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u89e3\u6c34\u4e2d\u96be\u751f\u7269\u964d\u89e3\u7684\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u6709\u673a\u6c61\u67d3\u7269.",

     "abstract": "Rutile TiO2 and goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH) composite photocatalysts were fabricated by hydrolysis and precipitation using titanium tetrachloride as a precursor and \u03b1-FeOOH as a support. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that at lower temperature, rutile TiO2 particles coat on the surface of \u03b1-FeOOH particles to form rutile TiO2-\u03b1-FeOOH composite photocatalyst. At higher temperature, iron ions are doped into the rutile TiO2 lattice to form iron-doped rutile TiO2 tubes; at medium temperature, the sample is a mixture with both composite and iron-doped structures. The photocatalytic activity of the samples is estimated by their ability to degrade methyl orange under irradiation with ultraviolet-visible light (200\u2013800 nm) at ambient temperature. The photocatalytic activities of the samples are improved compared with that of pure rutile TiO2 and \u03b1-FeOOH. The sample containing a mixture of composite and iron-doped structures shows the highest photocatalytic activity of that investigated. As a result, the photocatalytic activity of Ti2O could be improved effectively by combining with \u03b1-FeOOH or doping iron.\u4ee5\u56db\u6c2f\u5316\u949b\u4e3a\u949b\u6e90,\u2005\u9488\u94c1\u77ff(\u5e3d-FeOOH)\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u89e3\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u76f8\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u949b(Ti2O)\u4e0e\u5e3d-FeOOH\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6750\u6599,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04/\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c/\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf\u6563\u5c04\u8c31\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b,\u2005\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u76f8Ti2O\u5305\u8986\u4e8e\u5e3d-FeOOH\u8868\u9762,\u2005\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u590d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784; \u8f83\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b,\u2005\u94c1\u79bb\u5b50\u8fdb\u5165\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u76f8Ti2O\u6676\u683c,\u2005\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u94c1\u63ba\u6742\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u76f8Ti2O\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1; \u4e2d\u6e29\u4e0b,\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u517c\u6709\u590d\u5408\u548c\u63ba\u6742\u4e24\u8005\u7279\u5f81. \u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u4ee5\u7532\u57fa\u6a59\u4e3a\u964d\u89e3\u5bf9\u8c61,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u94a8\u706f+\u6c18\u706f(\u6ce2\u957f200\u2013800\u2005nm)\u4e3a\u5149\u6e90,\u2005\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u5bf9\u7532\u57fa\u6a59\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d; \u4e0e\u7eaf\u5e3d-FeOOH\u548c\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u76f8Ti2O\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u5747\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8,\u2005\u5176\u4e2d,\u2005\u590d\u5408\u517c\u63ba\u6742\u578b\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u9ad8. \u7531\u6b64\u53ef\u89c1,\u2005\u4e0e\u5e3d-FeOOH\u590d\u5408\u548c\u94c1\u63ba\u6742\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8Ti2O\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84.",

     "abstract": "A series of manganese and cerium oxides supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) catalysts for low-temperature NH3 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx were prepared by the pore volume impregnation method. The SCR activity of Mn-Ce/MWCNTs catalysts was compared with that of Mn/MWCNTs catalyst. The effects of Ce were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The results show that the addition of cerium oxides could improve the SCR activity of Mn/MWCNTs catalysts. Mn-Ce/MWCNTs catalyst with a Ce/Mn ratio of 0.6 was found to have the highest activity. The addition of cerium oxides enhanced the dispersion of metal oxides on the MWCNTs. It could also increase the specific surface area and total pore volume, and decrease the average pore size of the catalysts. Ce would improve the concentration of oxygen and the valence of manganese. Furthermore, from the XRD results, it was obvious that the crystalline MnOx disappeared because of the introduction of Ce to the catalyst. MnOx mainly existed in an amorphous state or microcrystal structure in the Mn-Ce/MWCNTs catalysts. CeO2 was found to be the main phase for CeOx.\u91c7\u7528\u7b49\u4f53\u79ef\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u591a\u58c1\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1(MWCNTs)\u8d1f\u8f7dCe-Mn\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86Ce\u63ba\u6742\u5bf9Mn/MWCNTs\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0aNH3\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f(SCR)NOx\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u626b\u63cf/N2\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644/\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5,\u2005\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86Ce\u63ba\u6742\u5bf9Mn/MWCNTs\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005Ce\u63ba\u6742\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684SCR\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u5176\u6d3b\u6027\u589e\u91cf\u968f\u7740Ce\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u5148\u589e\u5927\u540e\u51cf\u5c0f; \u5f53Ce/Mn\u4e3a0.6\u65f6,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u4f73. \u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a,\u2005Mn/MWCNTs\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0Ce\u540e,\u2005\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u5728MWCNTs\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u6563\u7a0b\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8; \u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u5b54\u4f53\u79ef\u589e\u5927,\u2005\u5e73\u5747\u5b54\u5f84\u51cf\u5c0f; \u6c27\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8; \u8868\u9762\u6c27\u542b\u91cf\u589e\u52a0,\u2005Mn\u5316\u5408\u4ef7\u5347\u9ad8; \u7ed3\u6676\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e,\u2005Mn\u4e3b\u8981\u4ee5\u65e0\u5b9a\u5f62\u6216\u5fae\u6676\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728,\u2005Ce\u4e3b\u8981\u4ee5CeO2\u7269\u76f8\u5b58\u5728.",

     "abstract": "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt/C catalysts was investigated in electrolytes of 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 containing varying concentrations of methanol in a half-cell. It was found that the ORR activity was improved notably in an electrolyte of 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 containing 0.1 mol/L CH3OH as compared with that in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4, 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 containing 0.5 mol/L CH3OH, or 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 containing 1.0 mol/L CH3OH electrolytes. The same tendency for improved ORR activity was also apparent after commercial Nafion\u00ae NRE-212 membrane was hot-pressed onto the catalyst layers. The linear sweep voltammetry results indicate that the ORR activities of the Pt/C catalyst were almost identical in the 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 + 0.1 mol/L CH3OH solution before and after coated with the Nafion\u00ae membrane. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results demonstrated that the resistance of the Nafion\u00ae membrane is smaller in the electrolyte of 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 + 0.1 mol/L CH3OH than in other electrolytes with oxygen gas feed. This exceptional property of the Nafion\u00ae membrane is worth investigating and can be applied in fuel cell stacks to improve the system performance.\u91c7\u7528X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04/\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c/\u539f\u5b50\u5438\u6536/\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5438\u6536\u8fd1\u8fb9\u5438\u6536\u8c31/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31/\u6c2e\u5438\u9644\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6c34\u70ed\u5408\u6210(HS)/\u7b49\u4f53\u79ef\u6d78\u6e0d(PVI)\u4e0e\u79bb\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362(IE)\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u7684CuSAPO-34\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u8001\u5316\u524d\u540e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0aC3H6-SCR\u4e0eNH3-SCR\u8131\u9664\u6a21\u62df\u67f4\u6cb9\u8f66\u5c3e\u6c14\u4e2dNOx\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005IE\u6cd5\u5236\u5f97\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u9ad8,\u2005\u5c24\u5176\u5728C3H6-SCR\u4f4e\u6e29\u9636\u6bb5; PVI\u6cd5\u5236\u5f97\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u5dee. \u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f71\u54cdCuSAPO-34\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef/\u5b54\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6d3b\u6027\u7ec4\u5206\u4ef7\u6001\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u5404\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5747\u5b58\u5728Cu+\u548cCu2+,\u2005\u4f46\u6bd4\u4f8b\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u540c.

     "abstract": "CuSAPO-34 samples prepared by hydrothermal synthesis (HS), pore-volume impregnation (PVI), and ion-exchange (IE) methods were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and N2 adsorption. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) ability over CuSAPO-34 for NOx from a simulated diesel exhaust was investigated through C3H6-SCR and NH3-SCR, before and after aging of the CuSAPO-34 catalyst. The results indicated that the sample prepared by IE had significantly better activity compared with those prepared using HS and PVI, especially in C3H6-SCR at temperatures below 300 \u00b0C. The activity of CuSAPO-34 in NO SCR was affected by the preparation method as a result of changes in the specific area (ABET), pore-size distribution, and the valence state of the active component. The active component of the catalyst prepared by HS was mainly Cu2+, whereas those of samples prepared by IE and PVI were mainly Cu+. Aging treatment can destroy the structure of the catalyst, decrease its surface area, and reduce the number of active Cu components on the catalyst surface, leading to a visible decrease in catalytic activity. The CuSAPO-34 prepared using the PVI method had the smallest decrease in NO SCR activity after aging, showing that it had better anti-aging properties.\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4CeO2\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u66ff\u4ee3\u975e\u4e00\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5546\u7528CeO2, \u7528\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8f7dPd\u800c\u5236\u5f97\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c14\u6c1b\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6e29\u7145\u70e7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2dPd\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u56e2\u805a\u53d7\u5230\u660e\u663e\u6291\u5236, \u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6709\u6c27\u6c27\u5316\u82ef\u7532\u9187\u751f\u6210\u82ef\u7532\u919b\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d, \u6240\u5236CeO2\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684Pd\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u53ef\u89c1, \u4e00\u7ef4\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u6750\u6599\u6709\u671b\u7528\u4f5c\u8f7d\u4f53\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u8d35\u91d1\u5c5e\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u56e2\u805a, \u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd.",

     "abstract": "One-dimensional (1D) CeO2 nanotubes can be used as a support to inhibit Pd nanoparticle aggregation during the high temperature calcination process in air. This is in opposition to the significant aggregation of Pd particles that is observed for the preparation of supported Pd metal catalysts using non-1D commercial CeO2 as support. The as-prepared Pd/CeO2 nanotube catalyst exhibits much higher catalytic performance than Pd/commercial CeO2 toward the aerobic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. This work suggests that 1D metal oxide materials can be used as a promising class of supports to inhibit noble metal nanoparticle aggregation, thereby improving catalytic performance toward target reactions.\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4CeO2\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u66ff\u4ee3\u975e\u4e00\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5546\u7528CeO2, \u7528\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8f7dPd\u800c\u5236\u5f97\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c14\u6c1b\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6e29\u7145\u70e7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2dPd\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u56e2\u805a\u53d7\u5230\u660e\u663e\u6291\u5236, \u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6709\u6c27\u6c27\u5316\u82ef\u7532\u9187\u751f\u6210\u82ef\u7532\u919b\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d, \u6240\u5236CeO2\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684Pd\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u53ef\u89c1, \u4e00\u7ef4\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u6750\u6599\u6709\u671b\u7528\u4f5c\u8f7d\u4f53\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u8d35\u91d1\u5c5e\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u56e2\u805a, \u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd.",

     "abstract": "A one-step hydrotreatment of soybean oil to produce iso-alkanes has been carried out over a Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor. The influence of reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, hydrogen/oil ratio, and space velocity on the catalytic performance has been investigated. From the levels of intermediate products, gas products (CO, CO2) and the target product (alkane), it was found that the hydrogenolysis of esters, fatty acids and fatty aldehydes and the formation of fatty alcohols were prohibited, which led to high selectivity for hydrodecarboxylation and hydrodecarbonylation at high temperature, low pressure or low hydrogen/oil ratio. The selectivity of the isomerization increased when temperature increased or space velocity decreased, while pressure and hydrogen/oil ratio were found to have no influence. A plausible reaction pathway has been proposed based on these results.\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e2d,\u2005\u4ee5\u5927\u8c46\u6cb9\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u6599,\u2005\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cd\u5e94\u6e29\u5ea6/\u538b\u529b/\u6c22\u6cb9\u6bd4\u548c\u7a7a\u901f\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9Pt/SAPO-11\u50ac\u5316\u6cb9\u8102\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u6c22\u5236\u5f02\u6784\u70f7\u70c3\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd,\u2005\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ea7\u7269/\u6c14\u4f53\u4ea7\u7269(CO,\u2005CO2)\u53ca\u70f7\u70c3\u7ec8\u4ea7\u7269\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u9ad8\u6e29/\u4f4e\u538b\u6216\u4f4e\u6c22\u6cb9\u6bd4\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u916f/\u7fa7\u9178\u548c\u919b\u7684\u6c22\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u9187\u7684\u751f\u6210,\u2005\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6cb9\u8102\u8131\u6c27\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5411\u8131\u7fa7\u548c\u8131\u7fb0\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c; \u5f02\u6784\u70f7\u70c3\u6536\u7387\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u5347\u9ad8\u6216\u7a7a\u901f\u51cf\u5c0f\u800c\u5148\u589e\u52a0\u540e\u4e0b\u964d,\u2005\u4f46\u53cd\u5e94\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6c22\u6cb9\u6bd4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927. \u53e6\u5916,\u2005\u5bf9\u6cb9\u8102\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u6c22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5386\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8ba8\u8bba.",

The effect of reaction time on the amount of carbon deposited during cracking was investigated. The catalysts were characterized using an automatic adsorption instrument (for Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis), temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the total amount of gaseous products produced in catalytic cracking over a monolithic Pt/CA(CeO2-Al2O3)-La-Al2O3 (CA is a support) catalyst increased by 39.7% compared with that produced by thermal cracking. The addition of BaO or SrO improved the total amount of gaseous products by 25.6% and 37%, respectively. If BaO and SrO were simultaneously added to the monolithic Pt/CA-La-Al2O3 catalyst, the catalytic effect improved significantly, and the total amount of gaseous products increased by 96.5%.

     "abstract": "Nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolite was modified with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) solution. The effect of the TPAOH treatment time on the catalytic performance of HZSM-5 was investigated in methanol to gasoline (MTG) reaction. The modified samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, 27Al and 29Si magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, N2 adsorption, and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption. The HZSM-5 structure was basically unchanged after modification, but the relative crystallinity increased and the crystal morphology was more regular. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, the micropore surface area, the surface Si/Al ratio, and the amount of strong acid sites increased; this might be caused by desilication and dealumination, and secondary crystallization of the zeolite during the treatment. The stability of the catalyst was significantly improved after modification, as reflected by the increased lifetime from 70 h to above 170 h in MTG reaction. The catalyst lifetime increased with increasing TPAOH treatment time. Hydrogen transfer reactions became faster and led to more isoparaffins and less olefins in the liquid products.\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u4e19\u57fa\u6c22\u6c27\u5316\u94f5(TPAOH)\u6eb6\u6db2\u5bf9\u7eb3\u7c73ZSM-5\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u6027, \u8fd0\u7528X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04/\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c/27Al\u548c29Si\u56fa\u4f53\u6838\u78c1/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31/N2\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644\u8131\u9644\u6cd5\u548cNH3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6240\u5236\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81, \u5e76\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u7532\u9187\u5236\u6c7d\u6cb9\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, \u6539\u6027\u540e\u7684HZSM-5\u76f8\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6676\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0, \u6676\u4f53\u5f62\u8c8c\u66f4\u52a0\u89c4\u6574, \u8868\u9762\u7845\u94dd\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0, \u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u5fae\u5b54\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u5927, \u5f3a\u9178\u4f4d\u9178\u91cf\u589e\u591a. \u540c\u65f6, TPAOH\u6539\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u8131\u7845\u8131\u94dd, \u800c\u4e14\u4f34\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u6676\u5316\u8865\u7845\u8865\u94dd, \u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7684\u7845\u94dd\u5206\u5e03. \u6539\u6027\u7684HZSM-5\u5728\u7532\u9187\u5236\u6c7d\u6cb9\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8, \u5176\u5bff\u547d\u753170\u2005h\u589e\u81f3170\u2005h\u4ee5\u4e0a, \u968f\u7740TPAOH\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u589e\u52a0, \u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5bff\u547d\u589e\u52a0, \u6c22\u8f6c\u79fb\u53cd\u5e94\u52a0\u5feb, \u5bfc\u81f4\u6cb9\u76f8\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e2d\u5f02\u6784\u70f7\u70c3\u589e\u591a, \u70ef\u70c3\u51cf\u5c11.",

     "abstract": "Modified ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by doping with alkaline earth metal oxides (CaO, SrO, or BaO) in a wet impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) with NH3 and CO2. Their catalytic performance in the vapor-phase selective dehydration of 1,4-butanediol (BDO) to 3-buten-1-ol (BTO) was investigated. The results showed that the alkaline earth metal can change the acid\u2013base properties on the catalyst surface and thus affect BDO conversion and BTO product selectivity. For ZrO2 catalyst modified by CaO, Ca2+ entered the ZrO2 crystal lattice and formed Ca-O-Zr hetero-linkages. These allowed the CaO/ZrO2 catalyst to maintain a high acid density and generate a large number of basic sites when compared with unmodified ZrO2. In contrast, SrO and BaO reacted with ZrO2 to generate the corresponding zirconates, which resulted in decreased acid density on the catalyst surface. Of the catalysts tested, CaO/ZrO2 showed the best catalytic performance. The highest yield of BTO was 60.5% and was achieved at 350 \u00b0C over CaO/ZrO2 catalyst. The key point for highly selective dehydration of BDO to BTO resided in the synergistic effect between acid and base sites on the catalyst surface.\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Ag\u50ac\u5316\u7684\u7fa7\u5316\u5076\u8054\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0eRu\u50ac\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u590d\u5206\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94\u4e32\u8054, \u7528\u7aef\u7094/\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3/\u7aef\u70ef\u57fa\u53d6\u4ee3\u7684\u6eb4\u4ee3\u7269\u548c\u7532\u57fa\u4e19\u70ef\u9178\u7532\u916f\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u4ea7\u7387\u5730\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2\u5316\u7684\u7094\u9178\u916f.",

The catalytic performances of the Ga2O3-SiO2 and Pt/ Ga2O3-SiO2 samples were evaluated for the degradation of cyanide using visible light. XRD and EDX results showed that the Pt was well dispersed within the Ga2O3-SiO2 phase and was detected on the surface of the catalyst, which confirmed the successful loading of Pt ions by the PAD method. BET results revealed that the surface area of Ga2O3-SiO2 was higher than that of Pt/Ga2O3-SiO2. 0.3 wt% Pt/Ga2O3-SiO2 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for degradation of cyanide under visible light. The catalyst could be reused with no loss in activity for the first 10 cycles.",

     "abstract": "Sequential reactions can provide efficient access to a variety of important organic compounds that would be otherwise difficult to obtain using conventional methods and readily available starting materials. Based on the importance of 2-alkynoates in organic synthesis, the current research aimed to develop a method for the convenient synthesis of functionalized 2-alkynoates from terminal alkynes, CO2, terminal alkene-derived bromides, and methyl acrylate using a combination of the carboxylative coupling and cross-metathesis reactions. The initial ligand-free silver-catalyzed carboxylative coupling reactions of a variety of different aryl-substituted terminal alkynes and CO2 with 5-bromopentene and 6-bromohexene provided a series of 4-pentenyl 2-alkynoates and 5-hexenyl 2-alkynoates, respectively, in good yield. These resulting 2-alkynoates were further transformed into methyl (E)-6-acetylenecarboxy-2-hexenoates and (E)-7-acetylenecarboxy-2-heptenoates in moderate to good yields by their cross-metathesis reactions with methyl acrylate in the presence of the Grubbs-Hoveyda catalyst.

The H2S/H2 treatment did not change the Ni2P phase or crystallite size even at temperatures as high as 873 K. However, S species were incorporated in the surface of the Ni2P crystallites to form surface phosphosulfide (NiPxSy) species, which blocked the Ni sites and induced their further electron-deficiency. H2S/H2 treatment also led to an increase of spilt-over hydrogen species. The treated Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst had higher turnover frequencies in the hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene than the untreated catalyst.

     "abstract": "A series of novel TiO2 nanocomposite crystals with superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity were successfully prepared using a soft chemical solution process involving direct reaction of aqueous H2O2 with a 2-ethoxyethanol solution of tetraisopropyl titanate before calcination of the resulting peroxo-titanium complexes at 500 \u00b0C for 4 h. The synthesized TiO2 samples are composed of anatase and rutile phases, and the ratio of rutile could be continuously tuned from 0 to 96% by altering the 2-ethoxyethanol volume. There are clear red-shifts in the UV-Vis absorption spectra and apparent band gap narrowing for the synthesized TiO2 in comparison with Evonik P-25. The synthesized TiO2 samples are found to be much more efficient for methylene blue degradation under visible-light irradiation. The optimized sample (2-ethoxyethanol: 5 ml; rutile in bulk: 46%) exhibits 5-fold higher adsorption capacity and 3-fold higher photocatalytic activity than those of Evonik P-25 (\u03bb \u2265 400 nm). Characterizations including X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the surface of the optimized TiO2 sample only contains a small quantity of rutile. It is concluded that the surface phase composition and distribution of the TiO2 nanocomposite crystals are essential to their greatly enhanced photocatalytic activities and strong adsorption capacities. In addition, the concentration of defects existing in the synthesized TiO2 is also regarded to account for these enhanced properties.\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u6eb6\u6db2\u6cd5,\u2005\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u949b\u9178\u56db\u5f02\u4e19\u916f\u76842-\u4e59\u4e8c\u9187\u5355\u4e59\u919a\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e0e\u4e00\u5b9a\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684H2O2\u6c34\u6eb6\u6db2\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u5e94\u5e76\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u949b\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u914d\u5408\u7269\u8fdb\u884c\u7119\u70e7,\u2005\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217TiO2\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u8868\u5f81\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u6240\u5f97TiO2\u6837\u54c1\u4e3a\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u548c\u9510\u949b\u77ff\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u590d\u5408\u6676\u4f53,\u2005\u6539\u53d82-\u4e59\u4e8c\u9187\u5355\u4e59\u919a\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u57280\u201396%\u5e7f\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u8c03\u53d8.\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1a\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u949bP-25\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005\u6240\u5f97\u7684TiO2\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u5438\u6536\u8c31\u51fa\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u7ea2\u79fb,\u2005\u95f4\u9699\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e, \u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b,\u2005\u8be5\u6837\u54c1\u5bf9\u4e9a\u7532\u57fa\u84dd\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u964d\u89e3\u6d3b\u6027. \u5f532-\u4e59\u4e8c\u9187\u5355\u4e59\u919a\u7684\u6dfb\u52a0\u91cf\u4e3a5 ml\u65f6,\u2005\u6240\u5f97\u6837\u54c1\u4f53\u76f8\u4e2d\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u63a5\u8fd150%,\u2005\u5176\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5438\u9644\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u597d,\u2005\u53ef\u5206\u522b\u662fP-25\u76843\u500d\u548c5\u500d. \u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u7ed3\u5408X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u7b49\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u8be5\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4ec5\u542b\u5c11\u91cf\u7684\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u76f8.

     "abstract": "The effects of a kosmotropic phosphate buffer (PB) or sodium sulfate (SS) on the enzymatic activity of crude Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (PCL) in organic media were explored. Previously, it was believed that SS acts as an effective enzyme activator, and PB was only used to adjust the solution pH. The present work showed PB-induced activation of PCL in the transesterification activity, where an increase of nearly 10-fold was achieved by carefully controlling the lyophilization condition. This activation, which gave about one-half of the native catalytic efficiency of PCL in aqueous media, was even more effective than the SS-induced activation. Thermogravimetric analysis of PCL preparations showed that different local environments surrounded PCL due to the presence of PB or SS. The local polarity of PCL preparations suspended in n-hexane was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy using 2-(4'-amino-2'-hydroxy phenyl)benzoxazole as the probe. SS-incorporated PCL showed a much stronger local polarity than PB-incorporated and salt-free PCL. A correlation was found between the transesterification activity and local polarity of the enzyme preparation as a function of salt content. The data confirmed that the salt-induced activation of PCL in organic media can be attributed in part to the polar environment constituted by the salt-bonded water surrounding the PCL.\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Al\u63ba\u6742TS-1\u2005(Al-TS-1)\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u53ca\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6c27\u5316\u6027\u80fd,\u2005\u91c7\u7528X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04/\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8c31/\u7535\u611f\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u8c31/\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c/27Al\u548c29Si\u56fa\u4f53\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9Al-TS-1\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d,\u2005Al\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cdTS-1\u4e2d\u9aa8\u67b6Ti\u7684\u5f62\u6210,\u2005\u4f46\u5f53Al\u542b\u91cf\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e00\u5b9a\u503c(Al/Si\u2005\u2264\u20050.005)\u65f6,\u2005\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f.

     "abstract": "The preparation of titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) containing Al (Al-TS-1) and its catalytic oxidation properties were investigated systematically. The features of Al-TS-1 were characterized using X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, 27Al magic-angle spinning and 29Si magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that incorporation of Al into the TS-1 framework influences the amount of framework Ti in Al-TS-1. However, when the Al/Si ratio is lower than 0.005, the amount of framework Ti in Al-TS-1 is hardly affected. Neither the Al centers nor the Ti centers in the Al-TS-1 framework influence the acidic catalytic and catalytic oxidation performance. Al in the Al-TS-1 framework suppressed desilication of silica species adjacent to framework Ti species in Al\u2013TS-1 in a basic catalytic system, so Ti active sites in the Al\u2013TS-1 framework could be protected.\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u7682\u4e73\u6db2\u805a\u5408\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u805a\u82ef\u4e59\u70ef(PS)\u805a\u5408\u7269\u5fae\u7403,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u80f6\u6676\u6a21\u677f\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u6709\u5e8f\u5927\u5b543DOM LaFeO3\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u578b\u6c27\u5316\u7269. \u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u5229\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u6c27\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u5faa\u73af\u53cd\u5e94\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6027,\u2005\u5e76\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u7532\u70f7\u6c27\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u4e0e\u79bb\u5fc3\u6cd5\u548c\u84b8\u53d1\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005\u5782\u76f4\u6c89\u79ef\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u7684PS\u5fae\u7403\u6a21\u677f\u6392\u5217\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u6709\u5e8f; \u524d\u9a71\u7269\u6eb6\u5242\u53ca\u6d53\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6709\u5e8f\u5927\u5b54\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u4e59\u9187\u4e3a\u524d\u9a71\u7269\u6eb6\u5242\u6240\u5236\u5907\u7684\u6837\u54c1\u6bd4\u5229\u7528\u4e59\u70ef\u4e3a\u6eb6\u5242\u7684\u6837\u54c1\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6709\u5e8f\u5927\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u524d\u9a71\u7269\u4e59\u9187\u6eb6\u6db2\u6d53\u5ea6\u57281.0 mol/L\u4e3a\u5b9c. \u7532\u70f7\u6c27\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e,\u20053DOM-LaFeO3\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u578b\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6c27\u7269\u79cd: \u8868\u9762\u5438\u9644\u6c27\u548c\u4f53\u76f8\u6676\u683c\u6c27. \u8868\u9762\u5438\u9644\u6c27\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u521d\u671f\u5c06\u7532\u70f7\u5b8c\u5168\u6c27\u5316\u4e3aCO2\u548c\u6c34\u84b8\u6c7d,\u2005\u800c\u4f53\u76f8\u6676\u683c\u6c27\u4e3b\u8981\u5c06\u7532\u70f7\u90e8\u5206\u6c27\u5316\u4e3aH2\u548cCO. \u5728\u7532\u70f7\u90e8\u5206\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d,\u2005\u4e09\u7ef4\u6709\u5e8f\u5927\u5b54LaFeO3\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u578b\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u6bd4\u76f8\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73LaFeO3\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6c27,\u2005\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4f7f\u7532\u70f7\u5728\u8f83\u5bbd\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210H2\u548cCO\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u4e3a2:1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6c14,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u8d39\u6258\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u5de5\u827a.",

     "abstract": "Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) LaFeO3 perovskite-type oxides were synthesized using a polystyrene colloidal crystal templating method. The obtained 3DOM LaFeO3 was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The reactivity of the perovskite-type oxides was evaluated using temperature-programmed reduction and multicyclic redox reactions by exposing them to an alternating methane and air atmosphere. The methane oxidation performance of the oxides was investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. The effect of the self-assembly method on the structure of the polystyrene template was also studied. A vertical deposition method yielded a more uniform and orderly polystyrene template than those obtained by centrifugation and evaporation techniques. The solvent and concentration of the precursor solution were the major factors to affect the prepared 3DOM perovskite. SEM analysis showed that samples synthesized with ethanol precursor solvent exhibited a better 3DOM structure than those produced with ethylene glycol, and that 1.0 mol/L may be an optimal precursor solution concentration. XRD and FTIR results suggested that the obtained 3DOM LaFeO3 was pure crystalline perovskite. Two kinds of oxygen species were found to exist on the 3DOM perovskites: surface adsorbed oxygen and bulk lattice oxygen. The surface oxygen contributed to the complete oxidization of methane to CO2 and H2O because of its higher reactivity, while the bulk lattice oxygen tended towards partial methane oxidation to H2 and CO. The available oxygen in the 3DOM LaFeO3 was higher than that of the same mass of non-3DOM LaFeO3 during the partial oxidation of methane. Methane was partially oxidized into syngas with a H2/CO ratio of around 2:1 in a wide time range of the reactions. The generated H2/CO = 2 syngas was suitable for subsequent gas-to-liquids processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch and/or methanol synthesis.\u91c7\u7528\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u8f90\u5c04\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4ecb\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u6c2e\u63ba\u6742TiO2\u7eb3\u7c73\u6676(N/TiO2). \u91c7\u7528N2\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u7c89\u672b\u884d\u5c04/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31/\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c/\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9N/TiO2\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u4ee5\u6ce2\u957f\u4e3a400\u2013660\u2005nm\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e3a\u5149\u6e90,\u2005\u4ee5\u6c34\u4f53\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u90bb\u82ef\u4e8c\u7532\u9178\u4e8c\u7532\u916f\u4e3a\u964d\u89e3\u5bf9\u8c61,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9N/TiO2\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u8f90\u5c04\u4f7f\u6c2e\u63ba\u6742\u6d53\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.2\u500d,\u2005\u8be5\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u7684N/TiO2\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u4ecb\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u8868\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u90bb\u82ef\u4e8c\u7532\u9178\u4e8c\u7532\u916f\u7684\u6d3b\u6027. \u5176\u6d3b\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662fN/TiO2\u542b\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u6c2e\u548c\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5438\u6536\u80fd\u529b.",

     "abstract": "An ultrasonic method was developed to fabricate novel mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystals doped with a high concentration of N (N/TiO2). The nanocrystals were characterized by physicochemical methods including N2 physical adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The photocatalytic degradation of dimethyl phthalate, a hazardous chemical in water, by the prepared N/TiO2 nanocrystals under visible light irradiation (400\u2013660 nm) was investigated. The results show that N-doping efficiency under ultrasonic irradiation is 3.2 times higher than under typical conditions, and the produced TiO2 nanocrystals have mesoporous structure. N/TiO2 fabricated under ultrasound exhibited much higher efficiency for the degradation of dimethyl phthalate than that prepared under typical conditions. The high photocatalytic degradation activity of N/TiO2 fabricated under ultrasound is mainly attributed to its high N content effectively increasing its ability to absorb visible light.\u91c7\u7528\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u8f90\u5c04\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4ecb\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u6c2e\u63ba\u6742TiO2\u7eb3\u7c73\u6676(N/TiO2). \u91c7\u7528N2\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u7c89\u672b\u884d\u5c04/X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31/\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c/\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9N/TiO2\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u4ee5\u6ce2\u957f\u4e3a400\u2013660\u2005nm\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e3a\u5149\u6e90,\u2005\u4ee5\u6c34\u4f53\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u90bb\u82ef\u4e8c\u7532\u9178\u4e8c\u7532\u916f\u4e3a\u964d\u89e3\u5bf9\u8c61,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9N/TiO2\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u8f90\u5c04\u4f7f\u6c2e\u63ba\u6742\u6d53\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.2\u500d,\u2005\u8be5\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u7684N/TiO2\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u4ecb\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u8868\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u90bb\u82ef\u4e8c\u7532\u9178\u4e8c\u7532\u916f\u7684\u6d3b\u6027. \u5176\u6d3b\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662fN/TiO2\u542b\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u6c2e\u548c\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5438\u6536\u80fd\u529b.",

The characteristics of the as-prepared C-TiO2 and a reference Degussa P25 TiO2 powder were examined using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, diffuse-reflectance ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The experimental conditions for the photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared C-TiO2 photocatalyst were controlled using three operational parameters, relative humidity, flow rate, and input concentration. Unlike other target compounds, very little benzene was removed by the C-TiO2 photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation. In contrast, the C-TiO2 exhibited higher removal efficiencies for the other three target compounds (toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) compared with those achieved using unmodified TiO2 under visible-light irradiation. The highest removal efficiency was obtained at a relative humidity value of 45%. Specifically, the toluene removal efficiency determined at a relative humidity of 45% was 78%, whereas it was close to 0%, 7.2%, and 5.5% for relative humidity values of 20%, 70%, and 95%, respectively. In addition, the removal efficiencies for the three target compounds decreased as the flow rate or input concentration increased. These findings indicate that the as-prepared C-TiO2 photocatalyst could be used for the removal of toxic vaporous aromatics under optimized operating conditions.",

To obtain a better understanding of the relationship between catalyst characteristics and catalytic performance, a thorough study of various catalyst samples (HZSM-5, Au/HZSM-5, Zn/HZSM-5, and Au-Zn/HZSM-5) was performed. The interactions between Au and Zn species in Au-Zn/HZSM-5 were determined using ultraviolet-visible and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Compared with Zn/HZSM-5, the introduction of Au to give Au-Zn/HZSM-5 effectively promotes the dehydrogenation and aromatization of n-butane, and also suppresses hydrogenolysis over Zn species. The n-butane conversion (70.8%) and selectivity for olefins and aromatics (61.98%) increased significantly. The dry gas selectivity also decreased significantly to 28.4%.

The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by decomposing butyl benzyl phthalate under visible-light irradiation. The results showed that the transformation of anatase to the rutile phase was inhibited and grain growth of TiO2 was prevented by P doping. The results confirm that the doped P atoms existed in two chemical forms, and those incorporated in the TiO2 lattice may play a positive role in photocatalysis. The high photocatalytic activities of the PTIO thin-films may be the result of extrinsic absorption through the creation of oxygen vacancies, rather than excitation of the intrinsic absorption band of bulk TiO2. The PTIO can be recycled with little depression of the photocatalytic activity. After six cycles, the photocatalytic activity of the PTIO film was still higher than 98%.",

     "abstract": "Raney Ni is one of the most widely used catalysts in the petrochemical industry. This material's intrinsic catalytic activity for hydrogenation may be enhanced by transforming the crystalline Ni-based alloy into an amorphous structure via melt-quenching. The meta-stability and low specific surface area of such amorphous alloys, however, can severely restrict their catalytic applications. Our work has demonstrated that the incorporation of rare earth (RE) elements increases the crystallization temperature of an amorphous Ni catalyst by 200 K. Related experimentation has determined that the specific surface area of such catalysts is dramatically increased by two orders of magnitude following alloying with Al and subsequent caustic leaching. In addition, by introducing a third metal as a promoter, the hydrogenation selectivity, corrosion resistance and magnetism of these materials may be precisely adjusted, giving rise to a family of skeletal amorphous Ni alloy catalysts, to which we apply the trade name SRNA. Among these catalysts, the SRNA-1 catalyst is used for the hydrogenation of pharmaceutical intermediates, SRNA-2 is employed for the hydrogenation of glucose into sorbitol, SRNA-3 is effective in the adsorptive desulfurization of gasoline and diesel and SRNA-4 is used for the purification of caprolactam. In addition, the SRNA-5 catalyst is useful in the hydrogenation of benzoic acid as a partial substitute for the costly Pd/C catalyst, reducing consumption of the latter during the hydrogenation process by almost 50%.Raney Ni\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u662f\u77f3\u6cb9\u5316\u5b66\u5de5\u4e1a\u7528\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e4b\u4e00, \u901a\u8fc7\u6025\u51b7\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5176\u6676\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u975e\u6676\u6001\u7ed3\u6784, \u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a0\u6c22\u6d3b\u6027. \u4f46\u975e\u6676\u6001\u5408\u91d1\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5c0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u50ac\u5316\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528. \u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u7a00\u571f\u5143\u7d20, \u4f7f\u975e\u6676\u6001 Ni \u6676\u5316\u6e29\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8200 K\u4ee5\u4e0a; \u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5165Al\u518d\u78b1\u62bdAl, \u4f7f\u975e\u6676\u6001Ni\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u52a0100\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a; \u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5165\u529f\u80fd\u52a9\u5242\u8c03\u8282\u975e\u6676\u6001Ni\u7684\u52a0\u6c22\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3001\u589e\u52a0\u6297\u9178\u78b1\u8150\u8680\u6027\u548c\u78c1\u6027, \u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u7cfb\u5217\u975e\u6676\u6001Ni\u52a0\u6c22\u50ac\u5316\u5242 (\u5546\u54c1\u540d\u4e3a SRNA). \u5176\u4e2d, SRNA-1 \u7528\u4e8e\u836f\u7269\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u52a0\u6c22; SRNA-2\u7528\u4e8e\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\u52a0\u6c22\u5236\u5c71\u68a8\u9187; SRNA-3\u7528\u4e8e\u6c7d\u3001\u67f4\u6cb9\u5438\u9644\u8131\u786b; SRNA-4\u7528\u4e8e\u5df1\u5185\u9170\u80fa\u52a0\u6c22\u7cbe\u5236; SRNA-5 \u7528\u4e8e\u82ef\u7532\u9178\u52a0\u6c22\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3Pd/C\u50ac\u5316\u5242, \u4f7f\u540e\u8005\u7684\u7528\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8650%.",

     "abstract": "The design and fabrication of catalytic materials is a key issue in heterogeneous catalysis to achieve desired performance. Traditionally, the main theme is to reduce the size of the catalyst particles as small as possible for increasing the number of active sites. In recent years, the rapid advancement in materials science has enabled us to fabricate catalyst particles with tunable shape at nanometer level. Through morphology control of nanoparticles by exposing highly reactive crystal planes, their catalytic properties can be drastically enhanced. Therefore, both size modulation and shape control of catalyst nanoparticles can be achieved independently or synergistically to optimize their catalytic behavior. We highlight, in this review, the recent progress in shape control of CeO2 materials that are widely used as crucial components or structural and electronic promoters in heterogeneous catalysts. We first summarize the major synthetic strategies and characteristics of shape-controlled CeO2 nanomaterials. We then survey morphology-dependent nanocatalysis of CeO2 and Au-CeO2 catalysts. We understand now that the enhanced catalytic property of the Au-CeO2 system is closely related to the unique interaction between the gold nanoparticles and the ceria support; such an interaction originates from the particular shape of ceria, especially the exposed facets. Finally, we present our understanding of the morphology-dependent nanocatalysis and provide our perspectives on their future potential and development. The fundamental understanding of the nature of the intrinsic active sites of the shape-tunable ceria nanostructures, enclosed by reactive crystal planes/facets with unique properties, is expected to provide highly efficient nanocatalysts for practical applications.\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u63a7\u662f\u83b7\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e. \u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u5c3d\u91cf\u51cf\u5c0f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u9897\u7c92\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u76ee, \u5373\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6548\u5e94. \u8fd1\u5e74\u6765, \u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8c03\u53d8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u5f62\u8c8c\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd, \u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u8c8c\u8c03\u63a7\u53ef\u66b4\u9732\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u9ad8\u6d3b\u6027\u6676\u9762, \u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd, \u5373\u7eb3\u7c73\u50ac\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u8c8c\u6548\u5e94. \u56e0\u6b64, \u8c03\u8282\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0e\u5f62\u8c8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5355\u72ec\u6216\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6027\u80fd. \u6c27\u5316\u94c8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u5206\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5242\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76f8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4f53\u7cfb. \u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8fd1\u671f\u6c27\u5316\u94c8\u6750\u6599\u5f62\u8c8c\u53ef\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55, \u5305\u62ec\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5; \u8fdb\u800c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6c27\u5316\u94c8\u548c\u91d1-\u6c27\u5316\u94c8\u50ac\u5316\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5f62\u8c8c\u6548\u5e94, \u6307\u51fa\u91d1-\u6c27\u5316\u94c8\u4e4b\u95f4\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u5f62\u8c8c\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173; \u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u6c27\u5316\u94c8\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u56e0\u66b4\u9732\u6676\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0d\u540c\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u673a\u5236.",

     "abstract": "Supported copper-based catalysts are widely used in many industrial processes because of their excellent catalytic performance and low cost. Understanding the interactions among the various components of these catalysts is an important step in exploring the nature of the catalytic reactions and provides a valuable scientific basis for the design of novel and efficient catalysts. This review summarizes a number of our recent results in this field. In this work, copper oxide was loaded on CeO2, CexZr1\u2212xO2, and MoO3-CeO2 supports to produce model catalysts. Investigations involving these materials demonstrated that the dispersion of copper oxide on the surface of the oxide supports, as well as some of the properties of these catalysts, can be explained on the basis of the incorporation model, which we have previously proposed. Based on spectroscopic characterization of these catalysts and examination of their catalytic performance for the oxidation of CO or the selective catalytic reduction of NO with CO/NH3, the relationships among the compositions, structures, and properties of these catalysts are discussed.\u8d1f\u8f7d\u578b\u94dc\u57fa\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u56e0\u5176\u826f\u597d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4e\u5ec9\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u4e1a\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528. \u63a2\u8ba8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u578b\u94dc\u57fa\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5206\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528, \u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e86\u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u50ac\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u672c\u8d28, \u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u65b0\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e. \u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u6211\u4eec\u5c31CuO\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f7d\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u6563\u3001\u94dc\u7269\u79cd\u548c\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u6539\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u4ee5\u53ca\u50ac\u5316CO\u5b8c\u5168\u6c27\u5316\u3001CO+NO\u548cNH3+NO+O2\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, CuO\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u8f7d\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5206\u6563\u548c\u6240\u5f97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u578b\u94dc\u57fa\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u53ef\u53c2\u8003\u201c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u201d\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u91ca, \u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4ee5CeO2, CexZr1-xO2\u548cMoO3-CeO2\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u94dc\u57fa\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u7ec4\u6210-\u7ed3\u6784-\u6027\u8d28\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb.",

     "abstract": "The aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) was performed on an activated carbon-supported ruthenium (Ru/C) catalyst. The excellent DFF yield of 95.8% was achieved at 383 K and O2 pressure 2.0 MPa in toluene. It exhibited superior activity and DFF selectivity than other C-supported noble metals (i.e. Pt, Rh, Pd, and Au) with comparable nanoparticle size. The Ru/C catalyst was stable and can be recycled by a simple hydrothermal treatment. Moreover, the product distribution in the HMF oxidation on Ru/C can be tuned by the use of water as solvent and the addition of hydrotalcite, giving either 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid or 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid as the dominant product.\u5728\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91d1\u5c5e\u948c(Ru/C)\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e865-\u7f9f\u7532\u57fa\u7ce0\u919b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6c27\u5316. \u4ee5\u7532\u82ef\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u6eb6\u5242, \u5728383 K\u548c2.0 MPa O2\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b, 2,5-\u544b\u5583\u4e8c\u7532\u919b(DFF)\u6536\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe95.8%. \u4e0e\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7c92\u5f84\u7684Pt, Rh, Pd, Au\u7b49\u5176\u5b83\u8d35\u91d1\u5c5e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u76f8\u6bd4, Ru/C\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u52a0\u4f18\u826f\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u548cDFF\u9009\u62e9\u6027. \u540c\u65f6Ru/C\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a, \u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u6027\u80fd. \u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b, \u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u4ee3\u66ff\u7532\u82ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6eb6\u5242, \u540c\u65f6\u6dfb\u52a0\u5c11\u91cf\u6c34\u6ed1\u77f3\u56fa\u4f53\u78b1, \u53ef\u4fbf\u6377\u5730\u5c06\u4e3b\u8981\u4ea7\u7269\u4eceDFF\u8c03\u53d8\u4e3a5-\u7532\u9170\u57fa-2-\u544b\u5583\u7532\u9178\u62162,5-\u544b\u5583\u4e8c\u7532\u9178, \u663e\u793a\u51faRu/C\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u63a7\u52365-\u7f9f\u7532\u57fa\u7ce0\u919b\u9009\u62e9\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4ea7\u7269\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd.",

     "abstract": "A series of Fe/zeolites (ZSM-35, ZSM-5, beta, and mordenite) samples with Fe/Al molar ratios of 0.33 were prepared using a solid-state ion-exchange method. A combination of ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance, in-situ Fourier-transform infrared, and in-situ visible Raman spectroscopic techniques, with a transient response method, was used to investigate the influence of the zeolite framework on the catalytic properties of the Fe/zeolites in N2O decomposition. The results show that the catalytic activity of the Fe/zeolites-HT (HT denotes high-temperature treatment) samples is in the order Fe/ZSM-35-HT > Fe/beta-HT > Fe/ZSM-5-HT > Fe/mordenite-HT. There is a linear relationship between the rate of N2O decomposition and the concentration of binuclear iron sites. This indicates that binuclear iron sites are the active sites for N2O decomposition. A correlation between the formation of binuclear iron sites and Fe ion distribution among the cationic sites is proposed. Two Fe(II) cations located in two adjacent six-membered rings in a 10-membered ring channel (\u03b1 sites) or in two neighboring six-membered rings in an eight-membered ring channel (\u03b2 sites) of Fe/ZSM-35 are favorable for the formation of active binuclear iron sites. Similar structure can also be formed in two adjacent six-membered rings in polymorphs A and B of beta zeolite or in the six-membered rings at the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channels of the ZSM-5 framework. For the Fe/mordenite-HT sample, most of the iron species are present as isolated iron cations, so it has the lowest activity in N2O decomposition.\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u6001\u79bb\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217Fe/Al\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u4e3a0.33\u7684Fe/\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b(ZSM-35, ZSM-5, beta\u548cmordenite (\u4e1d\u5149\u6cb8\u77f3))\u6837\u54c1, \u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u539f\u4f4d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u4ee5\u53ca\u77ac\u6001\u5e94\u7b54\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u79cd\u7c7b\u5bf9N2O\u5206\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e, \u7ecf\u9ad8\u6e29\u5904\u7406(HT)\u540e\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u987a\u5e8f\u4e3a Fe/ZSM-35 > Fe/beta > Fe/ZSM-5 > Fe/mordenite, \u4e0e\u9aa8\u67b6\u5916\u94dd\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53cc\u6838\u94c1\u7269\u79cd\u542b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4. \u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u53cc\u6838\u94c1\u7269\u79cd\u662f\u9ad8\u6e29\u5904\u7406\u540eFe/\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u6837\u54c1\u4e2dN2O\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4d, \u800c\u5b83\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u79cd\u7c7b\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173.

The CO oxidation reactions over the Ag and Pt catalysts showed that the oxidized Ag/oxide catalysts performed better in CO oxidation than the reduced ones did, whereas the reduced Pt/oxide catalysts had higher CO oxidation activity than that after oxidation treatment. The XRD and XPS measurements revealed that the oxidation treatment helped to improve the dispersion of Ag nanoparticles, but their metallic state was retained, which enhanced CO oxidation. In contrast, the surfaces of the Pt nanoparticles were dominated by PtO2 after the oxidation treatment, which lowered the CO oxidation activity compared with that of the reduced Pt catalyst.\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u949b\u9178\u94a1\u548c\u949b\u9178\u9499\u62c5\u8f7d\u7684Ag\u548cPt\u7eb3\u7c73\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u968f\u6c27\u5316-\u8fd8\u539f\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9CO\u5b8c\u5168\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u53d1\u73b0\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u62c5\u8f7d\u7684Ag\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u6c27\u5316\u5904\u7406\u540e\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u8f83\u8fd8\u539f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9ad8; X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04(XRD)\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31(XPS)\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, \u6c27\u5316\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f7d\u4f53\u8868\u9762Ag\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5ea6, \u800c\u8fd8\u539f\u5904\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4Ag\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u805a\u96c6, \u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u6c27\u5316CO\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6d3b\u6027. \u6c27\u5316-\u8fd8\u539f\u5904\u7406\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u62c5\u8f7dAg\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u5176CO\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027. \u4e0e\u6b64\u76f8\u53cd, \u6c27\u5316\u7269\u62c5\u8f7d\u7684Pt\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u8fd8\u539f\u5904\u7406\u540e\u6240\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684CO\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u8f83\u6c27\u5316\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9ad8; \u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0, \u6c27\u5316\u548c\u8fd8\u539f\u5904\u7406\u540ePt\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u57fa\u672c\u76f8\u540c, \u4f46\u662f\u6c27\u5316\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6837\u54c1\u4e2dPt\u8868\u9762\u7269\u79cd\u4ee5\u6c27\u5316\u6001\u4e3a\u4e3b, \u800c\u8fd8\u539f\u5904\u7406\u540ePt\u8868\u9762\u7269\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u91d1\u5c5e\u6001.

The obtained catalyst samples were characterized using N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance, CO chemisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, and infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. Compared to the catalyst prepared using the variable pH method, the catalyst prepared using the constant pH method had a higher surface area and Pt dispersion. More Br\u00f6nsted acid sites were generated in the presence of H2 on the latter catalyst, and this was responsible for its higher catalytic activity in n-heptane hydroisomerization.

     "abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to predict the most stable structure of Pd-doped Ni(111), Ni(100), and Ni(211) surfaces, and the activity for CH4 dissociation on pure and Pd-doped Ni surfaces. We predict that the thermodynamically most stable structures are the surface-doped Pd/Ni surfaces, where a surface Ni atom is replaced by a Pd atom; subsurface-doped Pd/Ni surfaces are thermodynamically unstable. Of the surface-adsorbed Pd/Ni surfaces, only the Pd/Ni(211) surface is thermodynamically stable. From the calculated adsorption energies of CH4 dissociation intermediates (CH4, CH3, CH, C and H) on surface-doped Pd/Ni surfaces, we find Pd-doping to reduce the adsorption energy for all species except for CH4. In addition, from the calculated activation barriers for CH4 and CH dissociations, we predict CH4 and CH to dissociate predominately on Ni(211) and Pd/Ni(211) step surfaces, followed by the broad Ni(100) and Pd/Ni(100) surfaces. Pd-doping raises the activation barriers for CH4 and CH dissociations. For the most active Ni(211) surface, Pd-doping causes the CH dissociation step to have a higher activation barrier than the CH4 dissociation step, which changes the rate limiting step, and helps reduce carbon deposition.\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Pd\u63ba\u6742\u7684Ni(111), Ni(100)\u548cNi(211)\u8868\u9762\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784, \u540c\u65f6\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u548cPd\u63ba\u6742\u7684Ni\u8868\u9762\u50ac\u5316CH4\u89e3\u79bb\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6d3b\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, \u7531Pd\u539f\u5b50\u53d6\u4ee3\u6700\u5916\u5c42Ni\u539f\u5b50\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u8868\u9762Pd\u63ba\u6742\u7684Ni\u8868\u9762\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0a\u6700\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a, \u4e9a\u8868\u9762Pd\u63ba\u6742\u7684Ni\u8868\u9762\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0a\u90fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a; \u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8868\u9762Pd\u5438\u9644\u7684Ni\u8868\u9762, \u53ea\u6709Pd/Ni(211)\u8868\u9762\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684. \u8868\u9762\u63ba\u6742\u7684Pd/Ni\u8868\u9762\u4e0aCH4\u89e3\u79bb\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53(CH4, CH3, CH, C, H)\u5438\u9644\u80fd\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, Pd\u7684\u63ba\u6742\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u51cf\u5f31\u4e86\u9664CH4\u4e4b\u5916\u5404\u89e3\u79bb\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u7684\u5438\u9644\u80fd. \u53e6\u5916, CH4\u548cCH\u5747\u4f18\u5148\u5728Ni(211)\u548cPd/Ni(211)\u53f0\u9636\u9762\u4e0a\u89e3\u79bb, \u5176\u6b21\u662f\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f00\u9614\u7684Ni(100)\u548cPd/Ni(100)\u8868\u9762\u4e0a.

     "abstract": "Supported Wacker catalysts exhibited high activity for low temperature CO oxidation, but high concentrations of water in the reaction gas could lead to the deactivation of the catalyst. The PdCl2-CuCl2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared, and a high relative humidity deactivation mechanism was suggested after characterizing the fresh and spent catalyst by X-ray diffraction, N2 absorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2-temperature programmed reduction and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The results showed that the water could adsorb and condense on the surface of the catalyst, which arouses the aggregation and transfer of Cu species into the internal pores of the catalyst. This weakens the interactions between the Pd and Cu species and reduces the re-oxidation ability of Pd0 to Pd2+, which blocks redox cycling and results in the decrease of CO oxidation activity.\u91c7\u7528X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u5438-\u8131\u9644\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6c22\u6c14-\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u548c\u539f\u4f4d\u7ea2\u5916\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u65b0\u9c9c\u548c\u5931\u6d3b\u7684PdCl2-CuCl2/Al2O3\u4f4e\u6e29\u50ac\u5316CO\u6c27\u5316\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81, \u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u76f8\u5bf9\u6e7f\u5ea6(100%)\u4e0b\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5931\u6d3b\u673a\u7406. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, \u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u6c89\u79ef\u7684\u6c34\u4f7f\u5f97\u6d3b\u6027\u94dc\u7269\u79cd\u5bb9\u6613\u4ece\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u5411\u8f7d\u4f53\u5b54\u9053\u5185\u90e8\u8fc1\u79fb, \u7531\u4e8ePd\u3001Cu\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f31\u5316\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5f31\u4e86Pd\u4e0eCu\u7269\u79cd\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528, \u4f7f\u5f97\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6c27\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u54cd, \u6291\u5236\u4e86Pd0\u518d\u6c27\u5316\u4e3aPd2+\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b, \u4ece\u800c\u56e0CO\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6c27\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u5faa\u73af\u53d7\u963b\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5931\u6d3b.",

     "abstract": "Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline electrolyte (0.5 mol/L KOH) was studied on a series of carbon supported Au nanoparticles (NPs) with average sizes ranging from 3 to 14 nm, using the rotating disk electrode methods. Downsizing the Au NPs from 14 to 3 nm resulted in continued enhancement in both the intrinsic and mass-specific activity of Au for ORR but produced no influence on the reaction mechanism or number of transferred electrons per O2-reduction. Careful analyses of the particle shapes of Au NPs with varied sizes by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy enabled us to estimate the fraction of surface Au atoms at different positions or coordination (energy) state. Correlating the fraction of high energy surface atoms with the Au activity for ORR disclosed the importance of high energy surface atoms in enhancing the intrinsic activity of Au.

     "abstract": "The hydrogenation of CO2 to light olefins was investigated over non-supported Fe catalysts. It was found that the addition of alkali metal ions to the Fe catalyst led to significant increases in both the CO2 conversion and the selectivity for olefins. Over K- or Rb-modified catalysts, about 40% CO2 conversion and more than 50% olefin selectivity were obtained. The yield of C2\u2013;C4 olefins exceeded 10% over these modified catalysts. Catalyst characterization suggested that the formation of iron carbide species was accelerated by the modification of the Fe catalyst with alkali metal ions, and this enhancement may be one of the key reasons for the enhanced catalytic performance. For the K-modified Fe catalysts, K content has a major influence on the catalyst behavior. An increase in the K content from 1 to 5 wt% increased both CO2 conversion and olefin selectivity. However, too high a K content led to a decrease in the activity, probably because of decreases in the surface area and CO2 chemisorption capacity of the catalyst. The presence of an appropriate amount of B in the K-modified Fe catalyst was found to be beneficial to the olefin selectivity, without significantly decreasing the conversion of CO2.\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u578b\u94c1\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0aCO2\u52a0\u6c22\u5236\u4f4e\u78b3\u70ef\u70c3\u53cd\u5e94. \u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a, \u6dfb\u52a0\u78b1\u91d1\u5c5e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u94c1\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u7684CO2\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u548c\u70ef\u70c3\u9009\u62e9\u6027. \u5728\u7ecfK\u548cRb\u4fee\u9970\u7684Fe\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a, CO2\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe\u7ea640%, \u70ef\u70c3\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fbe\u523050%\u4ee5\u4e0a, \u5176\u4e2dC2\u223cC4\u70ef\u70c3\u6536\u7387\u8d85\u8fc710%. \u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, \u78b1\u91d1\u5c5e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u78b3\u5316\u94c1\u7684\u751f\u6210, \u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u539f\u56e0. \u968f\u7740K\u542b\u91cf\u75311 wt%\u589e\u52a0\u81f35 wt%, CO2\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u53ca\u70ef\u70c3\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5747\u5347\u9ad8. \u4f46K\u542b\u91cf\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65f6, \u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u964d\u4f4e. \u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548cCO2\u5316\u5b66\u5438\u9644\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e\u6240\u81f4. \u5f53K\u542b\u91cf\u4e3a5%\u223c10%\u65f6, K-Fe\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u70ef\u70c3\u6536\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8; \u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6dfb\u52a0\u9002\u91cf\u7684\u787c\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u70ef\u70c3\u9009\u62e9\u6027, \u4e14CO2\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u5927.",

     "abstract": "The adsorption and reaction of NO on clean and O-precovered Cu(111) has been studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption spectroscopy. By varying NO exposure and annealing temperature, two different types of chemisorbed oxygen species, with O 1s binding energies (BE) of 531.0 (O531) and 529.7 eV (O529), were prepared on Cu(111). In the presence of O531 species, the relative occupation of different NO adsorption states was largely affected, and most of the adsorbed NO(a) underwent dissociative desorption, releasing N2O and N2 upon heating. In contrast, in the presence of O529 species, the dissociative desorption of NO(a) was largely suppressed. Furthermore, the O529 species show a more significant blocking effect on NO adsorption than the chemisorbed O531 species. Our results reveal that the effect of precovered oxygen species on the adsorption and reaction of NO on Cu(111) is closely related to the type of oxygen species and oxygen coverage.\u5229\u7528X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u8c31\u7814\u7a76\u4e86NO\u5728\u6e05\u6d01\u548c\u9884\u5438\u9644\u6c27\u7684Cu(111)\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u5438\u9644\u548c\u53cd\u5e94. \u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8NO\u7684\u66b4\u9732\u91cf\u548c\u9000\u706b\u6e29\u5ea6, \u5728Cu(111)\u8868\u9762\u53ef\u4ee5\u5236\u5907\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u7c7b\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u5438\u9644\u6c27\u7269\u79cd, \u5176O 1s\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u4f4d\u4e8e531.0 eV (O531)\u548c529.7 eV (O529). \u8868\u9762O531\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9NO\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5438\u9644\u72b6\u6001\u6709\u7740\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd, \u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u5f97\u5927\u90e8\u5206NO\u5438\u9644\u5206\u5b50(NO(a))\u5728\u52a0\u70ed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u4ee5N2O\u548cN2\u5f62\u5f0f\u8131\u9644; \u800c\u8868\u9762O529\u7269\u79cd\u5bf9NO(a)\u7684\u89e3\u79bb\u8131\u9644\u6709\u7740\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6291\u5236\u4f5c\u7528. \u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eO531\u7269\u79cd\u6765\u8bf4, O529\u7269\u79cd\u5bf9NO\u5438\u9644\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4f4d\u963b\u6548\u5e94. \u4e0a\u8ff0\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, NO\u5728Cu(111) \u8868\u9762\u7684\u5438\u9644\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u9884\u5438\u9644\u6c27\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u79cd\u7c7b\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173.",

     "abstract": "The ultrathin oxide films of bilayer FeO and trilayer FeO2 superstructures on Pt(111) with periodicity of (\u221a84\u00d7\u221a84)R 10.9\u00b0 are studied in detail by density functional theory, and the corresponding structural properties, electronic properties, and oxygen activities in different domains (FCC, HCP, and TOP) are calculated. It is found that for both superstructures, the in-plane lattice constants slightly increase in the order FCC < HCP < TOP. The calculated order of the surface corrugation (O-Fe rumpling) is FCC > HCP > TOP for FeO/Pt(111), and FCC > TOP > HCP for FeO2/Pt(111). The surface electrostatic potentials and the binding energies of the surface oxygen atoms are found to follow the same order as the surface corrugation. There is net charge transfer from the supported FeO film to the Pt substrate for FeO/Pt(111), and the calculated oxidation state of iron is +2.36. In contrast, for FeO2/Pt(111), there is charge transfer from the Pt substrate to the supported FeO2 film, and the calculated oxidation state of iron is +2.95 (ferric state). Compared with Pt(111), the change of the surface work function of FeO/Pt(111) is negligible, while it is 1.24 eV for FeO2/Pt(111). The role of the surface dipole of the supported oxide film and the charge transfer of the ultrathin oxide film are discussed.\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u8584\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u819c/\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f53\u7cfbFeO/Pt\u548cFeO2/Pt\u53ca\u5176\u8868\u9762\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df(FCC, HCP\u548cTOP)\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u6c27\u7684\u6d3b\u6027. \u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0, \u8868\u9762O-Fe\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5dee\u03b4z\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u5c40\u57df\u8868\u9762\u9759\u7535\u52bf\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6c27\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd: \u03b4z\u8d8a\u5927, \u9759\u7535\u52bf\u8d8a\u5927, \u6c27\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u8d8a\u5f31. \u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u73b0, \u5728FeO/Pt\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d, \u03b4z\u987a\u5e8f\u4e3aFCC > HCP > TOP, \u800cFeO2/Pt\u4e2d\u662fFCC > TOP > HCP. \u6b64\u5916, \u5728FeO/Pt\u4e2d, \u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u79fb\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u4ece\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u819c\u5230\u886c\u5e95, Fe\u7684\u8868\u89c2\u4ef7\u6001\u4e3a+2.36, \u8868\u9762\u529f\u51fd\u8f83\u7eafPt(111)\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565; \u800cFeO2/Pt\u4e2d, \u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u4ece\u886c\u5e95\u5230\u6c27\u5316\u7269, Fe\u7684\u8868\u89c2\u4ef7\u6001\u4e3a+2.95, \u8868\u9762\u529f\u51fd\u8f83\u7eafPt\u589e\u52a01.24 eV. \u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8868\u9762\u5076\u6781\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236. \u8fd9\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8d85\u8584\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u8584\u819c\u5bf9\u8868\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u3001\u8868\u9762\u6c27\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u542f\u793a\u610f\u4e49.",

     "abstract": "Solvent effects are important in synthetic chemistry, especially in preparing nanosized materials in solution. The sizes, morphologies, and properties of nanoparticles obtained from solution are greatly influenced by the solvents used. CoB catalysts were synthesized in solvents with different viscosity and polarity, including water, methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol. Solvent effects on the size and morphology of CoB were investigated using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nitrogen sorption measurements. CoB catalysts possessed non-crystalline structures composed of discrete nanoparticles, but became more agglomerated with increasing solvent viscosity. The hydrolysis of NaBH4 showed that catalyst morphology and texture greatly affected catalytic activity. XPS showed that Co and B were each present in elemental and oxidized states in the CoB catalysts, and that the Co/B surface ratio varied greatly with a higher Co/B ratio resulting in better catalytic properties. Solvent effects were analyzed in terms of steric hindrance and viscosity, and a mechanism for CoB synthesis in the different solvents was proposed.\u5206\u522b\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u7c98\u5ea6\u548c\u6781\u6027\u7684\u6c34\u3001\u7532\u9187\u3001\u4e59\u9187\u3001\u6b63\u4e19\u9187\u4e3a\u6eb6\u5242\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u94b4\u787c\u50ac\u5316\u5242, \u5e76\u901a\u8fc7X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u573a\u53d1\u5c04\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u548cN2\u5438\u9644\u7b49\u8868\u5f81\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6eb6\u5242\u6548\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22. \u6240\u5236\u5907\u7684\u94b4\u787c\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6676\u7ed3\u6784, \u4e14\u968f\u7740\u6eb6\u5242\u7c98\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0, \u7c92\u5b50\u56e2\u805a\u73b0\u8c61\u52a0\u5267. \u4e0d\u540c\u6eb6\u5242\u4e2d\u5236\u5907\u7684\u94b4\u787c\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5bf9\u4e8e\u787c\u6c22\u5316\u94a0\u6c34\u89e3\u4ea7\u6c22\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02, XPS\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\u94b4\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u787c\u5143\u7d20\u5747\u4ee5\u5143\u7d20\u6001\u53ca\u6c27\u5316\u6001\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728, \u800c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6eb6\u5242\u4e2d\u5236\u5907\u7684\u94b4\u787c\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u9762\u94b4/\u787c\u6bd4, \u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u94b4/\u787c\u6bd4\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u4ece\u6eb6\u5242\u7684\u7c98\u5ea6\u3001\u6eb6\u5242\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u963b\u6548\u5e94\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5bf9\u6eb6\u5242\u6548\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790, \u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u94b4\u787c\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6eb6\u5242\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u7406.",

Characterizations indicated that the addition of Ru or Re enhanced the adsorption and activation of hydrogen on the surface of catalysts, which contributed to the high conversion of glycerol.\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u4e86M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98(OH)16CO3 (M = Ru, Re)\u6c34\u6ed1\u77f3\u524d\u9a71\u4f53, \u7136\u540e\u7ecf\u7119\u70e7\u548c\u8fd8\u539f\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u94dc\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53cc\u529f\u80fdM-Cu/\u56fa\u4f53\u78b1\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cc\u529f\u80fd\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u7c97\u7518\u6cb9\u6c22\u89e3\u5236\u5907\u4e19\u4e8c\u9187\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e, M\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u6c22\u7684\u5438\u9644\u548c\u6d3b\u5316, \u8fdb\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u7518\u6cb9\u7684\u8f6c\u5316.",

     "abstract": "A new method has been developed for the catalytic conversion of biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) into \u03b3-valerolactone (GVL) with molecular hydrogen (H2) using a series of heterogeneous noble metal catalysts. Excellent yields of the GVL were obtained under mild reaction conditions of 50\u00b0C and 2 MPa of H2 using iridium nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes (Ir/CNT). It is noteworthy that the reaction proceeded smoothly in the presence of formic acid (FA, co-produced with LA in equimolar amounts during the acid-mediated hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass). Furthermore, the FA remained intact, highlighting the practical advantages of this process for the convenient and cost-effective processing of a biomass-derived LA/FA solution.

Several elementary steps making up this reaction were postulated and calculated. The Pd(111) surface shows the highest catalytic selectivity for H2O2 among the three surfaces. Open surfaces such as Pd(100) and Pd(110) are not favorable for this reaction because O\u2013O-containing species on these surfaces dissociate easily. The O\u2013O bond energy and the binding energy of O\u2013O-containing surface species are responsible for catalytic selectivity. The higher binding energy of O\u2013O-containing surface species is not favorable for the direct synthesis of H2O2 because the higher binding energy results in lower dissociation barriers.\u91c7\u7528\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e86H2\u548cO2\u5728Pd(111), Pd(100)\u53caPd(110)\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5408\u6210H2O2\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u7406, \u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u5143\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5206\u6790. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, Pd(111)\u8868\u9762\u5bf9H2O2\u76f4\u63a5\u5408\u6210\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6700\u597d, \u8868\u9762\u539f\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684Pd(100)\u8868\u9762\u548cPd(110)\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u542b\u6709O\u2013O\u952e\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7269\u79cd\u89e3\u79bb\u4e25\u91cd, \u4e0d\u5229\u4e8eH2O2\u7684\u751f\u6210.

     "abstract": "The one-pot aqueous phase reforming (APR) and hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol (PDO) was catalyzed by physically mixed skeletal NiMo and zinc oxide catalysts in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor without the aid of added H2. The skeletal NiMo catalyst alone is highly active towards glycerol but the selectivity for 1,2-PDO is only moderate. Physically mixing of MgO, SiO2, Al2O3, HZSM-5, TiO2, ZrO2, or CeO2 as a cocatalyst with skeletal NiMo was detrimental to the conversion of glycerol and yield of 1,2-PDO. However, physically mixing with ZnO gave an advantageous promoting effect on both the catalytic activity and selectivity for 1,2-PDO, and gave a 1,2-PDO yield of 52.0%, which is higher than that obtained with noble metal catalysts for the APR-hydrogenolysis of glycerol. The synergistic effect between physically mixed ZnO and skeletal NiMo was attributed to in situ enhancement of the Lewis acidity of ZnO by chemisorbed CO2 from the APR of glycerol on skeletal NiMo, which benefited both the dehydration of glycerol to acetol on ZnO and the hydrogenation of acetol to 1,2-PDO on skeletal NiMo.\u4ee5\u9aa8\u67b6NiMo\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u7269\u7406\u6df7\u5408, \u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e2d\u65e0\u5916\u52a0\u6c22\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e19\u4e09\u9187\u4e00\u9505\u6cd5\u91cd\u6574\u2013\u6c22\u89e3\u52361,2-\u4e19\u4e8c\u9187(1,2-PDO)\u7684\u6027\u80fd. \u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0, \u9aa8\u67b6NiMo\u81ea\u8eab\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u9ad8, \u4f46\u5bf91,2-PDO\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e00\u822c. \u5f53\u5c06\u5176\u4e0eMgO, SiO2, Al2O3, HZSM-5, TiO2, ZrO2\u6216CeO2\u673a\u68b0\u6df7\u5408\u65f6, \u4e19\u4e09\u9187\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u548c1,2-PDO\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5747\u53d1\u751f\u4e0b\u964d. \u4f46\u5f53\u4e0eZnO\u7269\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u65f6, \u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5747\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8, 1,2-PDO\u5f97\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe52.0%, \u4f18\u4e8e\u8d35\u91d1\u5c5e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u8be5\u4e00\u9505\u6cd5\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c. \u7269\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u7684ZnO\u4e0e\u9aa8\u67b6NiMo\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fd9\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528, \u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u91cd\u6574\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684CO2\u5728ZnO\u4e0a\u53d1\u751f\u5316\u5b66\u5438\u9644, \u539f\u4f4d\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86ZnO\u7684\u8def\u6613\u65af\u9178\u6027. \u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e19\u4e09\u9187\u5728ZnO\u4e0a\u8131\u6c34\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ea7\u7269\u4e19\u916e\u9187, \u4e5f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e19\u916e\u9187\u5728\u9aa8\u67b6NiMo\u4e0a\u52a0\u6c22\u751f\u62101,2-PDO.",

The as-prepared Ru-B-X/SBA-15 delivered catalytic activity up to seven times greater than that associated with the reference unsupported Ru-B-C catalyst prepared through the reduction of RuCl3 with BH4, and could be used repetitively 11 times without significant deactivation.\u4ee5\u4ecb\u5b54\u6c27\u5316\u7845(SBA-15)\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53, \u91c7\u7528\u8d85\u58f0\u8f85\u52a9(NH4)2RuCl6\u6d78\u6e0d\u548cBH4\u2212\u8fd8\u539f\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u8d1f\u8f7d\u578bRu-B\u50ac\u5316\u5242, \u5e76\u901a\u8fc7X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001X\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u3001\u5dee\u793a\u626b\u63cf\u91cf\u70ed\u6cd5\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, \u6240\u5236\u5f97\u7684Ru-B-X/SBA-15\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6676\u6001\u5408\u91d1\u7ed3\u6784, \u4e14Ru-B\u9897\u7c92\u9ad8\u5206\u6563\u5728SBA-15\u7684\u5b54\u9053\u4e2d. \u5728\u6db2\u76f8\u9ea6\u82bd\u7cd6\u52a0\u6c22\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d, \u4e0e\u91c7\u7528RuCl3\u4e3a\u91d1\u5c5e\u6e90\u5236\u5f97\u7684Ru-B-C/SBA-15\u76f8\u6bd4, Ru-B-X/SBA-15\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6d3b\u6027, \u662f\u975e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u578bRu-B-C\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u76847\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a, \u4e14\u80fd\u91cd\u590d\u5957\u752811\u6b21\u800c\u672a\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5931\u6d3b.",

     "abstract": "Graphene is a new material with a single-layer laminar structure of carbon atoms that possesses favorable physical and chemical properties such as high electrical conductivity, high chemical stability, and large specific surface area. Combining graphene with semiconductors to form composite photocatalysts can extend its light absorption edge, improve the migration rate of charge carriers, and enhance the adsorption capacity of contaminants. The unique two-dimensional planar structure of graphene endows composite photocatalysts with many excellent properties. Herein, the properties of graphene, semiconductor, and composite photocatalysts are first introduced. The various preparation methods of semiconductor/graphene composite photocatalysts are then presented, and the mechanisms behind enhanced photocatalysis are summarized. Four typical applications of composite photocatalysts: elimination of organic pollutants, hydrogen production, organic fuel production via CO2 reduction, and photocatalytic sterilization, are described in detail.

     "abstract": "Biomass can be converted into a variety of fuels and chemicals using different technologies. One such process is fast pyrolysis, which is convenient for the conversion of biomass primarily into liquid products known as bio-oils. These bio-oils, however, must be upgraded if they are to be used as a replacement for diesel and gasoline fuels. At present, when improving the quality of bio-oils, catalytic vapor cracking is generally considered superior to other catalytic upgrading technologies, such as hydrotreating and esterification. This review summarizes the current status of research concerning both the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and the catalytic cracking of bio-oil using the zeolite HZSM-5, focusing on the specific catalysts employed, as well as the upgrading methods and reaction mechanisms.\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd1\u671f\u7684HZSM-5\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u751f\u7269\u6cb9\u50ac\u5316\u88c2\u89e3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u751f\u7269\u6cb9\u63d0\u8d28\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u7406.",

     "abstract": "Phenethyl phenyl ether (PPE) was selected as a typical lignin model compound and hydrogenated and cleaved over two readily accessible nickel-based catalysts, which could be easily separated from the product mixture. The results revealed that the reduction of the nickel catalyst with gaseous hydrogen produced a species capable of achieving higher activity towards C-O-C bond cleavage compared to the Ru/C and Pd/C catalysts. The selectivity of the C-O-C bond cleavage over the Ni/C catalyst was 85%, and higher than the corresponding values in the Ru/C (40%) and Pd/C (69%) systems. Using the carbothermal reduction method for the production of the Ni/C-C catalyst, the conversion and selectivity levels reached 99%, with 40% of the benzene rings in PPE being reserved. In comparison, no benzene ring containing products wer observed over the noble metal catalysts. This difference was attributed to the interaction between the carbon support and the nickel nanoparticles.\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Ni\u57fa\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u6728\u8d28\u7d20\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u82ef\u57fa\u82ef\u4e59\u919a\u4e2dC\u2013O\u2013C\u952e\u52a0\u6c22\u88c2\u89e3\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, 14;Ni/C\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u52a0\u6c22\u88c2\u89e3\u80fd\u529b, 14;\u82ef\u57fa\u82ef\u4e59\u919a\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u8fbe\u523099%\u4ee5\u4e0a.

     "abstract": "In this communication, we report a novel strategy to prepare a MoS2/Al2O3 hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalyst by thermally treating a MoS3/Al2O3 precursor in H2 atmosphere. In our approach, the active phase precursor MoS3 was first prepared using thioacetamide and sodium molybdate as sources of S and Mo, respectively, and ethanol as a dispersant. The precursor was deposited onto the surface of a \u03b3-Al2O3 support and heat-treated to form the catalyst. The catalyst was characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The HDS activity of the catalyst was assessed using dibenzothiophene as a model reactant. The catalyst possessed larger specific surface area and pore volume, higher dispersion and degree of sulfidation of Mo species, and shorter and more suitable stacking of MoS2 slabs, resulting in superior catalytic activity compared with a catalyst with the same metal content prepared by the conventional impregnation method. Ethanol could disperse the precursor MoS3 particles via \u201cS\u2026H-O\u201d H-bonding to lessen their aggregation.\u4ee5\u786b\u4ee3\u4e59\u9170\u80fa\u4e3a\u786b\u6e90, 14;\u94bc\u9178\u94a0\u4e3a\u94bc\u6e90, 14;\u4e59\u9187\u4e3a\u5206\u6563\u5242, 14;\u91c7\u7528\u5316\u5b66\u6c89\u79ef\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86MoS3/Al2O3\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u524d\u9a71\u4f53, 14;\u518d\u7528H2\u9ad8\u6e29\u5904\u7406\u5f97\u5230\u9ad8\u5206\u6563\u786b\u5316\u578bMoS2/\u03b3-Al2O3\u50ac\u5316\u5242, 14;\u8fd0\u7528N2\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5bf9MoS2/\u03b3-Al2O3\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81, 14;\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e8c\u82ef\u5e76\u567b\u5429\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u52a0\u6c22\u8131\u786b(HDS)\u6d3b\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, 14;\u4e0e\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4, 14;\u6240\u5236\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u5b54\u4f53\u79ef\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u91d1\u5c5e\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u4f73\u7684Mo\u7269\u79cd\u786b\u5316\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u77ed\u7684MoS2\u7247\u5c42\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5806\u79ef\u5ea6, 14;\u56e0\u800c\u5728\u4e8c\u82ef\u5e76\u567b\u5429HDS\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fdc\u4f18\u4e8e\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u6240\u5236\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6d3b\u6027. \u4e59\u9187\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7S\u2026H-O\u6c22\u952e\u5438\u9644\u81f3MoS3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u8868\u9762, 14;\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u5176\u751f\u957f\u548c\u56e2\u805a, 14;\u8d77\u5230\u5206\u6563\u5242\u7684\u4f5c\u7528. 14;",

The results of low temperature N2 adsorption-desorption and oxygen storage capacity tests demonstrated that Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-Al2O3 exhibits a large specific surface area and excellent oxygen storage capacity, and that Ti0.9Zr0.1O2 exhibits superior textural properties. Evaluations of catalytic activity showed that the catalyst prepared from these materials has reduced capacity for the oxidation of SO2 but high catalytic activity towards the oxidation of hydrocarbons (HC) and CO, and is also able to convert the exhaust soluble organic fraction at temperatures as low as 140 \u00b0C.

     "abstract": "A series of Ru-Mn catalysts with different Mn contents were prepared by coprecipitation, and their catalytic performance, using nanoscale ZrO2 as a dispersant, for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene was investigated. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N2 physisorption, X-ray fluorescence, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy. The results confirmed that the Mn existed as Mn3O4 on the Ru surface. The Mn3O4 reacted with ZnSO4 to form an insoluble [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt, which was readily chemisorbed on the Ru surface. This chemisorbed salt played a key role in improving the cyclohexene selectivity over the Ru catalyst. The cyclohexene yield of 61.3% was obtained over the Ru-Mn catalyst with the optimum Mn content of 5.4%.

It was found that the noble metal-doped samples exhibited higher degradation rates compared with bare titania.

     "abstract": "CeZrAl oxides (CZA) using as the support of Pd catalyst for purification of gasohol exhausts are synthesized by co-precipitation assisted by ultrasonic vibration. CZA are characterized by surface analysis, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen, oxygen storage capacity (OSC), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that ultrasonic vibration promotes the formation of smaller, more uniform pores in CZA, which is beneficial to the dispersion of Pd species. Ultrasonic vibration can also improve the OSC and uniformity of the composition of CZA on its surface and in bulk. Catalytic tests demonstrate that ultrasonic treatment of CZA widens the window of the full use of oxygen from 0\u20130.64% to 0\u20131.16% of Pd-CZA catalysts in the purification of gasohol exhaust, and decreases the light-off temperature of ethanol, propane, and carbon monoxide by 30, 28, and 24 \u00b0C, respectively. Moreover, the interaction between Pd species and CZA can enhance the reaction of NO with propane and ethanol.\u5728\u5171\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee5\u8d85\u58f0\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u94c8\u9506\u94dd\u590d\u5408\u6c27\u5316\u7269 14;(CZA), 14;\u91c7\u7528\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u3001X 14;\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u3001\u50a8\u6c27\u91cf\u548c 14;X 14;\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e, 14;\u8d85\u58f0\u632f\u8361\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u800c\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5b54\u751f\u6210, 14;\u6709\u5229\u4e8e 14;Pd 14;\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u5206\u6563; \u8d85\u58f0\u632f\u8361\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8 14;CZA 14;\u7684\u50a8\u6c27\u91cf, 14;\u4f7f\u6750\u6599\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0e\u4f53\u76f8\u7ec4\u6210\u8d8b\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4. \u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e, 14;\u6750\u6599\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8d85\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u7684 14;Pd-CZA 14;\u51c0\u5316\u4e59\u9187\u6c7d\u6cb9\u8f66\u5c3e\u6c14\u65f6, 14;\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6c27\u6c14\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u5229\u7528\u7a97\u53e3\u4ece 14;0\u223c0.64% 14;\u62d3\u5bbd\u81f3 14;0\u223c1.16%; \u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u4e59\u9187\u3001C3H8 14;\u548c 14;CO 14;\u8d77\u71c3\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u4e0b\u964d\u4e86 14;30, 14;28 14;\u548c 14;24 14;\u00b0C. \u6b64\u5916, 14;Pd 14;\u7269\u79cd\u4e0e 14;CZA-U 14;\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u5229\u4e8e 14;NO 14;\u4e0e 14;C3H8 14;\u548c 14;C2H5OH 14;\u7684\u53cd\u5e94.",

     "abstract": "The effect of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) on the hydrolysis activityof Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) toward triacylglycerol was investigated. The critical micelle concentrations (CMC) of ILs with Br\u2212, Cl\u2212, and [BF4]\u2212 anions and the solubility of ILs with [PF6]\u2212 anions were determined in phosphate buffer. Results suggested that the content of the ILs, not kosmotropicity, highly influenced the effects of anions and cations of ILs on CRL activity. As the length of alkyl chain of the cation [CnMIM]+ increased, lower IL content was required to achieve high enzyme activity. Once the concentrations of the ILs with Br\u2212, Cl\u2212, and [BF4]\u2212 anions exceeded the CMC value, enzyme activity was suppressed. The positive promotion effect of anions on enzyme activity was in the order of Br\u2212 Cl\u2212 [BF4]\u2212 [PF6]\u2212. The effect of ionic liquid on enzyme activity was highly dependent on the pH and temperature of the system, with the optimum pH being 7.000. Under optimal conditions of pH 7.000, 30 \u00b0C, and 47.6 mmol/L of [C8MIM]Br, the highest relative activity of CRL (1734%) was achieved, with a specific activity of 54.4 U/mg protein.\u8003\u5bdf\u4e861-\u70f7\u57fa-3-\u7532\u57fa\u54aa\u5511\u7c7b\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u5bf9\u67f1\u72b6\u5047\u4e1d\u9175\u6bcd\u8102\u80aa\u9176(CRL)\u50ac\u5316\u6a44\u6984\u6cb9\u6c34\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd, 14;\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5bfc\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u78f7\u9178\u76d0\u7f13\u51b2\u6db2\u4e2dBr\u2212, 14;Cl\u2212, 14;[BF4]\u2212\u7cfb\u5217\u54aa\u5511\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u80f6\u675f\u6d53\u5ea6(CMC)\u548c[PF6]\u2212\u7cfb\u5217\u54aa\u5511\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u6eb6\u89e3\u5ea6. \u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a, 14;\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u9634\u3001\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\u9176\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e0e\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u7684Kosmotropicity\u6027\u8d28\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5173\u8054, 14;\u4f46\u4e0e\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u5728\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u542b\u91cf\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173, 14;\u5728\u6700\u9002\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u542b\u91cf\u65f6, 14;\u9176\u6d3b\u6027\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8; \u9633\u79bb\u5b50[CnMIM]+\u4e2d\u7684n\u8d8a\u5927, 14;\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9176\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u9002\u5b9c\u542b\u91cf\u8d8a\u4f4e; Br\u2212, 14;[BF4]\u2212\u7cfb\u5217\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7CMC\u65f6\u5219\u6291\u5236\u9176\u6d3b; \u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\u9176\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5927\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u4e3aBr\u2212>Cl\u2212>[BF4]\u2212>[PF6]\u2212. \u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u5bf9\u9176\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u4f53\u7cfbpH\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u6539\u53d8, 14;\u5728\u6700\u9002\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u6d53\u5ea6\u65f6\u7684\u6700\u9002pH\u5747\u4e3a7.000. \u5728pH 7.000, 14;30\u00b0C\u4ee5\u53ca[C8MIM]Br\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e3a47.6 mmol/L\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b, 14;\u6700\u9ad8\u76f8\u5bf9\u9176\u6d3b\u529b\u548c\u6bd4\u6d3b\u529b\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52301734%\u548c54.4 U/mg protein.",

     "abstract": "The titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) modified by various metals (M-TS-1; M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, La, 1% metals loading) catalysts were employed to catalyze butadiene epoxidation. The metals influenced the TS-1 activity in various ways. V, Cr, and Mn caused H2O2 decomposition. Although the H2O2 conversion was high, its utilization was relatively low. The introduction of Fe, Co, Ni, and La into TS-1 promoted the vinyloxirane (VO) yield and H2O2 utilization to some extent. Cu and Zn modification inhibited the H2O2conversion to VO, resulting in both low H2O2 utilization and conversion. We studied the influence of Cd on TS-1 and found that H2O2was almost totally converted to VO over the Cd-TS-1 catalyst, and the turnover number of VO reached 1197. Powder X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption and desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transformed infrared spectra were employed to characterize the specific metal role at the Ti site in the M-TS-1 catalysts. The TS-1 remained as MFI structure with doped metals. The added metals effectively changed the electron environment of the Ti active site.

     "abstract": "The development of catalytic science and technology in China dates from the early 20th century. In the beginning, the efforts of our predecessors gave an initial period of steady development. Then in the 1960s, there were serious obstacles by human factors during which the development of catalysis was stagnant and we lost more than ten years of development opportunity. In the 1980s, catalysis in China entered a period of rapid expansion. During this period, three main research sectors, namely, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), universities, and industries, were rapidly established and development recovered. Researchers carried out research using reaction kinetics as the main method and means. In basic research, the discovery of novel catalytic materials, characterization methods, and novel catalytic reactions were the main research directions. The introduction of surface science and nanoscience has greatly promoted and deepened the basic exploration of catalysis. Catalysis is now changing from an art to a science. In different historical periods, researches in applied catalysis were determined by national needs and these have made notable contributions to many fields, such as the optimal utilization of coal, petroleum and natural gas, advanced materials, and protection of environment as well as human health. Currently, China has begun contributing to important progress in catalysis and is moving towards becoming a regular contributor.\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u59cb\u4e8e\u200520\u2005\u4e16\u7eaa\u521d,\u2005\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5148\u8f88\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u4f7f\u5176\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u521d\u671f\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u53d1\u5c55\u9636\u6bb5,\u2005\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7531\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e3a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7834\u574f\u4f7f\u5176\u5904\u4e8e\u505c\u6ede\u5e76\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u5341\u4f59\u5e74\u5927\u597d\u53d1\u5c55\u65f6\u673a. 20\u2005\u4e16\u7eaa\u200580\u2005\u5e74\u4ee3,\u2005\u4e2d\u56fd\u50ac\u5316\u4e8b\u4e1a\u8fdb\u5165\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u65f6\u671f. \u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\u671f,\u2005\u8fc5\u901f\u6062\u590d\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e2d\u79d1\u9662\u3001\u9ad8\u6821\u548c\u4ea7\u4e1a\u90e8\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u519b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u961f\u4f0d. \u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f62\u5f0f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u624b\u6bb5\u7684\u7814\u7a76,\u2005\u57fa\u7840\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u65b0\u50ac\u5316\u6750\u6599\u3001\u65b0\u50ac\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411. \u8868\u9762\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u7eb3\u7c73\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u5927\u5927\u4fc3\u8fdb\u548c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u63a2\u7d22,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u6b63\u4ece\u827a\u672f\u8d70\u5411\u79d1\u5b66\u2026\u2026. \u5728\u5e94\u7528\u50ac\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u9762,\u2005\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\u671f\u7ed3\u5408\u56fd\u5bb6\u91cd\u5927\u9700\u6c42,\u2005\u5728\u7164\u3001\u77f3\u6cb9\u3001\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u4f18\u5316\u5229\u7528,\u2005\u5148\u8fdb\u6750\u6599,\u2005\u73af\u5883,\u2005\u4eba\u7c7b\u5065\u5eb7\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u8d21\u732e. \u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u5927\u56fd\u5e76\u6b63\u5728\u8d70\u5411\u50ac\u5316\u5f3a\u56fd.",

     "abstract": "Solid acid catalysts have been widely used in petrochemical industry and their catalytic activities are normally dictated by their acidities. Unlike conventional acidity characterization techniques such as titration, infrared, or temperature-programmed desorption, detailed acid features of solid acids, such as type, distribution, concentration, and strength of acid sites may be attained by advanced methods involving pertinent probe molecules and state-of-the-art solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) techniques, i.e. double resonance and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopies. In addition, in situ solid-state NMR method is capable of probing the guest/host properties of the reactant at the active centers of the catalysts as well as the intermediate species formed during conversion. It provides direct experimental evidence for exploring the mechanism of catalytic reaction. In this report, the fundamental theory and the recent developments in solid-state NMR are reviewed with specific focus on relevant applications in structure and acidity characterization of solid acid catalysts and catalytic mechanisms.\u56fa\u4f53\u9178\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u77f3\u6cb9\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d,\u2005\u5176\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u9178\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173. \u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9178\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5(\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u3001\u6ef4\u5b9a\u7b49)\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u3001\u53cc\u5171\u632f\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u76f8\u5173\u8c31\u7b49\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f(NMR)\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u56fa\u4f53\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u9178\u79cd\u7c7b\u3001\u9178\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u9178\u6d53\u5ea6\u548c\u9178\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7b49\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f. \u540c\u65f6,\u2005\u539f\u4f4d\u56fa\u4f53NMR\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53cd\u5e94\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5438\u9644\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u7269\u79cd,\u2005\u4e3a\u63ed\u793a\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e. \u672c\u6587\u8be6\u7ec6\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u56fa\u4f53NMR\u7684\u539f\u7406\u548c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u76f8\u5173\u65b0\u6280\u672f,\u2005\u7740\u91cd\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u56fa\u4f53NMR\u6280\u672f\u5728\u9178\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u5c55.",

     "abstract": "In this review, we discuss recent progress in the catalytic transformation of polyols to value-added chemicals, including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), ethylene glycol (EG), 1,2-propylene glycol (1,2-PG) and 1,3-propylene glycol (1,3-PG). The challenges and solving of the synthesis of HMF from different carbohydrates, such as fructose, glucose and cellulose are analyzed. For the conversion of HMF, we focus on the catalytic oxidation of HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid and their applications to polymers. Advances in the catalytic hydrogenolysis of polyols including cellulose, sugar alcohols and glycerol to diols such as EG, 1,2-PG and 1,3-PG are reviewed, and the reaction mechanisms were discussed.

     "abstract": "Ordered mesoporous manganese oxide (om-MnOx) was prepared and used in oxidation by hydrogen peroxide of norfloxacin (NFX). The om-MnOx was prepared using a hard template method. The catalytic activity of om-MnOx was investigated by evaluating the changes in degradation efficiency and antibacterial activity of NFX. om-MnOx exhibited significant catalytic activity for the degradation of NFX in water by hydrogen peroxide. Lower pH conditions favored the catalytic activity of om-MnOx/hydrogen peroxide. The presence of om-MnOx achieved a greater reduction in the antibacterial ability of NFX than that was obtained with hydrogen peroxide alone. The inhibiting effect of t-butanol indicated that om-MnOx enhanced the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Byproducts from NFX were detected during the om-MnOx-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide process, and possible reaction pathways were proposed.\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u6a21\u677f\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u6709\u5e8f\u4ecb\u5b54\u6c27\u5316\u9530,\u2005\u5e76\u7528\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u6c22\u6c27\u5316\u8bfa\u6c1f\u6c99\u661f\u7684\u964d\u89e3\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u6297\u83cc\u6d3b\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u6709\u5e8f\u4ecb\u5b54\u9530\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027; \u4f4e\u2005pH\u2005\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u4e0e\u5355\u72ec\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u6c22\u6c27\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005\u6709\u5e8f\u4ecb\u5b54\u9530\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u51cf\u5f31\u4e86\u8bfa\u6c1f\u6c99\u661f\u7684\u6297\u83cc\u6d3b\u6027. \u53d4\u4e01\u9187\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6291\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u8868\u660e\u6709\u5e8f\u4ecb\u5b54\u9530\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u6c22\u5206\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u7f9f\u57fa\u81ea\u7531\u57fa. \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bfa\u6c1f\u6c99\u661f\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u4ea7\u7269\u9274\u5b9a,\u2005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u9014\u5f84.",

     "abstract": "Zeolite T membranes with very good permeation performance were successfully synthesized on porous mullite supports by the secondary growth method with homemade microsized seeds from clear solutions. The influence of synthesis parameters such as the molar ratios of SiO2/Al2O3 and H2O/SiO2, alkalinity, synthesis temperature, and crystallization time on membrane growth and permeation performance was investigated systematically. It is found that these parameters strongly affect the zeolite T growth and pervaporation performance of the membranes. Under the optimized synthesis conditions of 1SiO2:0.015Al2O3:0.41 (Na2O+K2O):30H2O, the crystallization time was shortened to 6 h at 423 K and a continuous and dense T-type zeolite layer as thin as 5 \u03bcm formed on the surface of the support. It significantly improved the membrane density and permselective properties. A permeation flux and separation factor of 4.20 kg/(m2\u00b7h) and 7800, respectively, were obtained with the as-synthesized membrane for 10 wt% water-90 wt% i-propanol mixtures at 348 K. It also exhibited a very good pervaporation performance for water/ethanol mixtures separation.

The thermal decomposition reaction conditions, including reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and reaction time, were studied in the presence of nano-Cu2O. The results show that Cu2O prepared using a hydrolysis method and then calcined at 300 \u00b0C in Ar atmosphere for 2 h exhibited the optimal catalytic activity. The optimal reaction conditions were as follows: mass ratio of catalyst to MDPC 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22124, reaction temperature 220\u00b0C, reaction time 12 min, and reaction pressure 0.6 kPa.

     "abstract": "Ceria (CeO2) catalysts doped with different metal ions were prepared by sol-gel or impregnation methods, and their catalytic activity for soot combustion was evaluated by thermogravimetry. Temperature-programmed reduction was used to investigate the influence of their redox properties on soot combustion performance. The results indicate that the oxidation temperature of soot can be significantly reduced using catalysts containing transition metals, which provide increased surface and lattice oxygen compared with undoped CeO2. The ability of each catalyst to deliver active oxygen at low temperature (200\u2013400 \u00b0C) plays an important role in determining catalytic performance. However, incorporation of structure promoter, alkali metals, and alkaline earth metals increase the delivery of active oxygen only at moderate temperature (above 400 \u00b0C), which accelerate the combustion rate of soot.\u91c7\u7528\u6eb6\u80f6-\u51dd\u80f6\u6cd5\u6216\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u91d1\u5c5e\u79bb\u5b50\u63ba\u6742\u7684\u94c8\u57fa\u590d\u5408\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u70ed\u91cd\u6cd5\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u78b3\u70df\u71c3\u70e7\u7684\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u501f\u52a9H2-TPR\u2005(\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f)\u624b\u6bb5\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6c27\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u5bf9\u78b3\u70df\u71c3\u70e7\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u63ba\u6742\u4fc3\u4f7f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6c27\u548c\u6676\u683c\u6c27,\u2005\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u78b3\u70df\u7684\u6c27\u5316\u6e29\u5ea6,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e8e200\u223c400\u2005\u00b0C\u91ca\u653e\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u6c27\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u78b3\u70df\u71c3\u70e7\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981; \u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u52a9\u5242\u91d1\u5c5e\u3001\u78b1\u91d1\u5c5e\u6216\u78b1\u571f\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u63ba\u5165\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6e29\u6d3b\u6027\u6c27\u6570\u91cf,\u2005\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u78b3\u70df\u8d77\u71c3\u6e29\u5ea6\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584,\u2005\u4f46\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u78b3\u70df\u7684\u71c3\u70e7\u901f\u7387.",

     "abstract": "Potassium titanate (KTO) nanobars were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and used as a precursor to synthesize TiO2 nanocrystals. La doping of the TiO2 nanocrystals was achieved by introducing La3+ into the hydrothermal media. The hydrothermal transition of KTO to TiO2 was investigated under various conditions, finding that the pH of the hydrothermal media, the temperature, and the pre-treating procedure play important roles in the phase transition. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the crystal phase and morphology of the samples and the transition process of the hydrothermal reaction. The content of La3+ in the samples was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the La-doped TiO2 (LaT) was measured under UV light with the degradation of methyl orange (MO, 10 mg/L). The results showed that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 was enhanced remarkably by La-doping. LaT hydrothermally prepared with 0.15 mol/L La3+ at under 180 \u00b0C showed the optimal reaction constant of 0.11 min\u22121 for the degradation of MO, about 9.20 and 3.69 times than those of bare TiO2 and P25, respectively.\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u949b\u9178\u94be\u2005(K2Ti8O17)\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u68d2,\u2005\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u6c34\u70ed\u8f6c\u6676\u5408\u6210\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u6676,\u2005\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6c34\u70ed\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u571f\u5143\u7d20\u2005La3+\u2005\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u2005La\u2005\u63ba\u6742. \u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u949b\u9178\u76d0\u5411\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u8f6c\u6676\u8fc7\u7a0b,\u2005\u53d1\u73b0\u6c34\u70ed\u6eb6\u6db2\u7684\u2005pH\u2005\u503c\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bf9\u8f6c\u6676\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u5229\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u4ee5\u53ca\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u6676\u76f8\u548c\u5f62\u8c8c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u5229\u7528\u7535\u611f\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u539f\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u6240\u5408\u6210\u7684\u2005La\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u2005TiO2\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u4e2d\u7684\u2005La\u2005\u542b\u91cf. \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u4e0b\u964d\u89e3\u7532\u57fa\u6a59\u2005(MO,\u200510\u2005mg/L)\u2005\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u2005La\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u2005TiO2\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u2005La\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u540e\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8. \u5728\u20050.15\u2005mol/L\u2005La3+\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0b\u2005180\u2005oC\u2005\u6c34\u70ed\u5408\u6210\u7684\u2005La\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u2005TiO2\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u5176\u5bf9\u2005MO\u2005\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94\u5e38\u6570\u9ad8\u8fbe\u20050.11\u2005min\u22121,\u2005\u5927\u7ea6\u662f\u7a7a\u767d\u2005TiO2\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u20059.20\u2005\u500d,\u2005P25\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u20053.69\u2005\u500d.",

     "abstract": "The crystallization process of SAPO-11 was studied using a combination of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In the initial stage of crystallization, SAPO-11 was formed along with an unknown crystalline material composed of Si-P-Al. As crystallization evolved, the crystalline material dissolved. The SAPO-11 formation rate increased greatly, which is characteristic of fast crystallization. After 2.33 h, the relative crystallinity of SAPO-11 reached \u223c100% and remained at a high level until crystallization was complete. Si was incorporated into the SAPO-11 framework from the initial stage of crystallization. The Si content of the solid samples increased with crystallization time. Most of the Si atoms existed as Si islands in the SAPO-11 framework, resulting in the presence of multiple coordination environments, i.e., Si(nAl, (4 \u2212 n)Si), n = 0\u20134. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed Si enrichment on the external surfaces of the SAPO-11 crystals.

     "abstract": "The influence of calcination and pretreatment conditions on the structure of Co3O4 and its activity for CO oxidation were studied. TG analysis indicated that the precursor of Co3O4 prepared by a precipitation method was present in the form of cobalt hydroxide carbonate, calcination of which within the temperature range of 150\u2013400 \u00b0C in air resulted in the formation of cubic phase Co3O4. N2 adsorption-desorption, powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and activity test results showed that the prepared Co3O4 samples were comprised of nanoparticles, with the specific surface area and size distribution closely related to the calcination temperature. Over these samples, a size dependence of the catalytic activity for CO oxidation was clearly observed. As identified by positron annihilation lifetime spectrum, low temperature oxygen temperature-programmed desorption, and durability testing for CO oxidation, pretreatment of Co3O4 in N2 within the temperature range 150\u2013250 \u00b0C favors the formation of surface oxygen vacancy clusters, the occurrence of which would be beneficial for the adsorption and activation of O2, and also for the catalytic oxidation of CO.

     "abstract": "Highly crystalline ZSM-5 zeolites are important for para-selective alkylation of alkyl aromatics, because they carry few external acid sites for isomerization of p-dialkyl products. Such zeolites (Si/Al = 25, 50, and 75) were synthesized in a fluoride medium between pH 4 and 6. Their crystallinities, crystal sizes, and surface areas were higher than those of a commercial ZSM-5 zeolite. Their para selectivities in alkylation were tested for vapor-phase tert-butylation of ethylbenzene between 200 and 400 \u00b0C. As expected, all the catalysts showed more than 90% para selectivity. At 300 \u00b0C, ethylbenzene conversion decreased in the order ZSM-5(25, commercial) > ZSM-5(25) > ZSM-5(50) > ZSM-5(75). The catalysts had weak, medium, and strong acid sites, but all the acid sites of ZSM-5(75) were weaker than those of ZSM-5(25) and ZSM-5(50). The high activity of commercial ZSM-5 was caused by its strong acid sites being stronger than those of the synthesized zeolites. Although the activity of the commercial catalyst was higher than those of the present catalysts, the selectivity for 4-t-butylethylbenzene (4-t-BEB) was low. The optimum feed ratio (ethylbenzene:t-butyl alcohol) was 2:1 and the feed rate was 1.65 h\u22121 for high ethylbenzene conversion and 4-t-BEB selectivity. Time-on-stream studies showed slow catalyst deactivation. Highly crystalline ZSM-5 zeolites are therefore better than a commercial zeolite for para-selective alkylation of alkyl aromatics. They do not require much post-modification for high para selectivity. A fluoride medium is therefore better than an alkaline medium for obtaining highly crystalline para-selective ZSM-5 zeolites.",

     "abstract": "Nanostructured ceria materials have attracted wide attention as catalysts, and the doping of these materials with rare earth elements to modify their catalytic activity has been comprehensively investigated. A novel type of Ni-doped hierarchical nanostructured peony-like ceria (PCO) has been prepared and its catalytic activity is investigated and compared with that of Ni-loaded samples. The prepared Ni-doped ceria have nanoscale grain sizes and open mesopores. This unique morphology endows it with superior catalytic activity for the oxidation of CO and the partial oxidation of methane. It is found that extra oxygen vacancies are generated in the ceria, and the reducibility of the ceria is highly enhanced after Ni-doping. The catalytic activity for CO oxidation is improved after Ni-doping, compared with that of pure ceria and Ni-loaded ceria. In the reaction for the partial oxidation of methane, the 3.8 atm% Ni-loaded PCO sample realizes a higher CH4 conversion than the Ni-doped ceria. However, it is found that the onset temperature for CH4 conversion decreases from 400 \u00b0C for the pure PCO and 3.8 atm% Ni-loaded PCO sample, to 340 \u00b0C for the 5.7 atm% Ni-doped PCO sample.\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u2005Ni\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u591a\u5c42\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u7261\u4e39\u82b1\u72b6\u2005CeO2\u2005\u6750\u6599,\u2005\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd,\u2005\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u2005Ni\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7261\u4e39\u82b1\u72b6\u2005CeO2\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005Ni\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u2005CeO2\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u5177\u6709\u7eb3\u7c73\u6676\u7c92\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u4ecb\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u5f62\u8c8c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u2005CO\u2005\u6c27\u5316\u548c\u7532\u70f7\u90e8\u5206\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u7279\u6027.

     "abstract": "Ruthenium catalysts on various activated carbon (AC) supports were prepared using conventional calcination and microwave irradiation. Their activity in the catalytic ozonation of dimethyl phthalate was studied. The relationship between the structure and activity was investigated. All the supports and catalysts increased total organic carbon removal. The activity order was Ru/coal-AC > nutshell-AC > Ru/nutshell-AC > Ru/coconut-AC \u2248 coal-AC > coconut-AC. The supported Ru particles diffused into the macropores, which increased mass transfer resistance in catalytic ozonation and decreased the probability that the reactants can contact the active phase on the interior surface. This was one reason why the activity of nutshell-AC and Ru/nutshell-AC was lower than that of Ru/coal-AC. A difference in Ru dispersion on the surface of the catalyst also caused the activity difference. The active phase on the surface of nutshell-AC can be changed by microwave irradiation, which caused Ru/nutshell-AC to even be less active than the corresponding support. As compared to the use of conventional calcination, the use of microwave irradiation enhanced the metal dispersion and catalytic activity of Ru/coal-AC.\u91c7\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u7119\u70e7\u548c\u5fae\u6ce2\u8f90\u5c04\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u2005(AC)\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u2005Ru\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u50ac\u5316\u81ed\u6c27\u6c27\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u90bb\u82ef\u4e8c\u7532\u9178\u4e8c\u7532\u916f\u2005(DMP)\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d,\u2005\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6784\u6548\u5173\u7cfb. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u6240\u6709\u2005AC\u2005\u548c\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ed\u6c27\u6c27\u5316\u2005DMP\u2005\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u2005TOC\u2005(\u603b\u6709\u673a\u78b3)\u2005\u53bb\u9664\u7387,\u2005\u5176\u6d3b\u6027\u987a\u5e8f\u4e3a\u2005Ru/coal-AC\u2005>\u2005nutshell-AC\u2005>\u2005Ru/nutshell-AC\u2005>\u2005Ru/coconut-AC\u2005\u2248\u2005coal-AC\u2005>\u2005coconut-AC. \u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u2005Ru\u2005\u9897\u7c92\u6269\u6563\u5230\u2005AC\u2005\u5927\u5b54\u4e2d,\u2005\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u4f20\u8d28\u963b\u529b,\u2005\u4f7f\u5f97\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u4e0e\u2005AC\u2005\u5185\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4d\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u2005Ru\u2005\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u673a\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11,\u2005\u8fd9\u662f\u2005Ru/nutshell-AC\u2005\u548c\u2005Ru/coconut-AC\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4e\u4e8e\u2005Ru/coal-AC\u2005\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u56e0; \u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u2005Ru\u2005\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u4e5f\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u522b\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00. \u5fae\u6ce2\u52a0\u70ed\u5f15\u8d77\u2005nutshell-AC\u2005\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u6027\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u2005Ru\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u964d\u4f4e. \u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7119\u70e7,\u2005\u5fae\u6ce2\u8f90\u5c04\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u2005coal-AC\u2005\u8868\u9762\u2005Ru\u2005\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5ea6,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027.",

Ce20Cu5Ni0.4Ox exhibited the highest catalytic activity. The addition of NiO increased the amount of copper ions doped into the CeO2 matrix and gave more oxygen vacancies in ceria by the formation of a Ni-O-Ce solid solution. XPS results showed that large quantities of Cu+, Ce3+, and lattice oxygen existed in the fresh Ce20Cu5Ni0.4Ox catalyst. Cu+ ions in the catalyst can easily migrate to the ceria lattice to form a Cu-O-Ce solid solution, which enhanced the release of the lattice oxygen of the oxides under a reducing atmosphere. The high catalytic activity of Ce20Cu5Ni0.4Ox is due to the promoter giving increased amounts of Cu+ in the catalyst and the formation of solid solutions of both Cu-O-Ce and Ni-O-Ce.\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u2005CO\u2005\u4f4e\u6e29\u6c27\u5316\u7684\u2005Ce20Cu5NiyOx\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6c2e\u6c14\u4f4e\u6e29\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644\u3001X\u2005http://baike.baidu.com/view/290246.htm{\u5c04}\u884d\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u3001X\u2005http://baike.baidu.com/view/290246.htm{\u5c04}\u5149\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u4ee5\u53ca\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005Ce20Cu5Ni0.4Ox\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u9ad8.

     "abstract": "Nitrogen-incorporated titanium silicalite-1 (NTS-1) was used to prepare a supported gold catalyst for direct gas-phase epoxidation of propylene using H2 and O2. The NTS-1 was synthesized by direct calcination of the TS-1 powder in a flow of NH3 at high temperature. Gold catalyst supported on NTS-1 was synthesized by the deposition-precipitation method. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that nitrogen was incorporated into the TS-1 framework, and that the NTS-1 preserved the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI) structure well. It was found that NH3-treatment resulted in decreased acidity of the TS-1 zeolite support and improved both the Au capture efficiency and dispersion, which remarkably improved the catalytic performance. The enhanced activity was ascribed to the decrease in acidic surface sites and the ligand effect of the terminal NH2 groups on the support surface.\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6e29\u6c28\u6c14\u5904\u7406\u5236\u5f97\u542b\u6c2e\u5fae\u5b54\u949b\u7845\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u2005(NTS-1)\u2005\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53,\u2005\u7528\u6c89\u79ef-\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5236\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7eb3\u7c73\u91d1\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u91d1\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u6c22\u6c14\u548c\u6c27\u6c14\u5171\u5b58\u4e0b\u50ac\u5316\u4e19\u70ef\u6c14\u76f8\u73af\u6c27\u5316\u5236\u73af\u6c27\u4e19\u70f7\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u9ad8\u6e29\u6c28\u6c14\u5904\u7406\u949b\u7845\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u2005(TS-1)\u2005\u8f7d\u4f53\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5176\u9178\u6027,\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u91d1\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5236\u5907\u4e2d\u91d1\u7684\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u91d1\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u91d1\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5ea6,\u2005\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7eb3\u7c73\u91d1\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u8f7d\u4f53\u9178\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u548c\u8f7d\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u2013NH2\u2005\u914d\u4f4d\u6548\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "Liquid phase hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide over VOx-TiO2 catalyst samples with Cu as a second metal was investigated. A series of Cu/VOx-TiO2 (vanadium loading was 4.3%) catalysts were prepared within the range of Cu loading (0.29%\u20132.5%) and calcined at the temperatures of 350\u2013650 \u00b0C. The catalyst samples were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. After the addition of Cu, the Cu/VOx-TiO2 catalyst had more ordered mesoporous structure as compared with the VOx-TiO2 catalyst, and the vanadium was monodispersed on the TiO2 support. The presence of Cu2+ ions on the catalyst surface was shown by XPS measurements. These Cu2+ ions probably contributed to the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the TiO2 support, and the more facile reduction of VOx. The Cu2+ ions also strengthened the thermostability of the Cu/VOx-TiO2 catalyst. The effects of some other variables (Cu loading, catalyst amount, and reaction temperature) on the catalytic performance were also investigated.\u5c06\u2005Cu\u2005\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u91d1\u5c5e,\u2005\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u2005Cu\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u91cf\u7684\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7119\u70e7\u7684\u53cc\u91d1\u5c5e\u6539\u6027\u7684\u2005Cu/VOx-TiO2\u2005\u590d\u5408\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u6db2\u76f8\u82ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7f9f\u57fa\u5316\u5236\u82ef\u915a\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d. \u56fa\u5b9a\u9492\u7684\u542b\u91cf\u4e3a\u20054.3%,\u2005\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0d\u540c\u2005Cu\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u91cf\u2005(w\u2005=\u20050.29%\u20132.5%)\u2005\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u2005(350\u2013650\u2005\u00b0C)\u2005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7119\u70e7. \u5229\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u3001H2\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u4ee5\u53ca\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u52a0\u5165\u2005Cu\u2005\u540e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u4ecb\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u2005VOx\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u5728\u8f7d\u4f53\u2005TiO2\u2005\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u6563\u548c\u2005VOx\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u8fd8\u539f,\u2005\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027,\u2005\u5176\u4e2d\u2005Cu\u2005\u4ee5\u2005+2\u2005\u4ef7\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d. \u53e6\u5916,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7528\u91cf,\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u6e29\u5ea6\u7b49\u5bf9\u82ef\u7f9f\u57fa\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.",

     "abstract": "Hierarchically porous materials that can be used as catalysts or catalyst supports have garnered much attention due to their enhanced mass transport and multiple functionalities. Hierarchically porous catalysts integrate at least two levels of porosity and present the advantages associated with each level of porosity, from selectivity to mass transport. For example, hierarchically porous zeolites offer an effective solution to the mass transport problem associated with conventional zeolites in catalyzed reactions, because they combine the catalytic features of micropores and the improved accessibility and increased molecular transport related to the addition of several porosities within a single body. This review thoroughly summarizes recent developments that have been made in the field of hierarchically porous catalysts, with the main focus on the synthesis strategies that are available as well as their application in catalysis. It is the intent of this work to stimulate intuition into the optimal design of related hierarchically porous catalysts with desired characteristics.\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u591a\u7ea7\u5b54\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u3001\u591a\u7ea7\u5b54\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u548c\u591a\u7ea7\u5b54\u78b3\u57fa\u6750\u6599\u7b49\u591a\u7ea7\u5b54\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55,\u2005\u4e3b\u8981\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u7ea7\u5b54\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6750\u6599\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528.",

     "abstract": "The primary tasks of refineries in the future are to improve the yield of light oil and to produce clean fuels and high-quality chemical raw materials. The efficient conversion of heavy oil is necessary to improve the yield of light oil. This conversion requires some crucial technologies, including: (1) residue hydrotreating technology, (2) the research institute of petroleum processing's (RIPP's) integrated combination process for residue hydroprocessing, (3) the integration of selective hydrogenation of fluid catalytic cracking gas oil with selective catalytic cracking process, and (4) the combination of superficial solvent deasphalting, hydrotreatment of deasphalted oil, and fluid catalytic cracking technology. The most important technologies for producing clean fuels such as qualified gasoline and diesel include the RIPP's selective hydrodesulfurization technology, the RIPP's hydrogenation technology for producing ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel, and catalysts for producing RS-1000 and RS-2000 (grades of ultra-low-sulfur diesel). To produce high quality chemical raw materials, the Sinopec hydroprocessing for maximum propylene of fluid catalytic cracking process is of vital importance.

     "abstract": "The first commercial application of the magnetically stabilized bed (MSB) reactor is discussed. The MSB reactor uses a magnetic catalyst in a uniform magnetic field to combine the many advantages of the fixed bed, slurry bed, moving bed, and fluidized bed reactors. An industrial MSB reactor requires a large and uniform magnetic field, which was obtained by optimizing the coil installation spacing and inserting magnetic grids in the reactor. It was used for the intensification of the hydrogenation processes by operating in the chain mode. By utilizing the excellent hydrogenation activity and magnetism of an amorphous Ni catalyst, a MSB reactor was developed for the hydrorefining of caprolactam. Five industrial units of 200\u2013400 kt/a production capacity have been built since 2003. The use of the appropriate magnetic catalyst in the MSB reactor also enhanced activities in CO methanation, selective acetylene hydrogenation and olefin oligomerization. This technology gives new opportunities for process intensification.\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u78c1\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u4e0a\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528,\u2005\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u6d46\u6001\u5e8a\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u5e8a\u548c\u6d41\u5316\u5e8a\u7b49\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u70b9. \u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7ebf\u5708\u95f4\u8ddd\u3001\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u5185\u8bbe\u7f6e\u78c1\u9694\u6805\u6784\u4ef6,\u2005\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5747\u5300\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u653e\u5927; \u7ed8\u5236\u51fa\u78c1\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u94fe\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f8\u56fe. \u5c06\u975e\u6676\u6001\u2005Ni\u2005\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u52a0\u6c22\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u4e0e\u78c1\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408,\u2005\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5df1\u5185\u9170\u80fa\u52a0\u6c22\u7cbe\u5236\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528,\u2005\u5e76\u5efa\u6210\u20055\u2005\u5957\u200520\u223c$40\u2005\u4e07\u5428/\u5e74\u5de5\u4e1a\u88c5\u7f6e. \u78c1\u6027\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0e\u78c1\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408,\u2005\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u7532\u70f7\u5316\u3001\u4e59\u7094\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u52a0\u6c22\u548c\u70ef\u70c3\u53e0\u5408\u7b49\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b,\u2005\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u751f\u957f\u70b9.",

     "abstract": "Waste oils and fats (WOFs) are non-edible oils generated in amounts of more than 30 million and 10 million tons/year in China, respectively, from the production and consumption of cooking oil, and which would pollute the environment if disposed of improperly. Due to its poor quality, it is very difficult to transform WOFs to biodiesel by base catalyzed transesterification, especially when these have high free fatty acids and impurities. A new technology, sub-critical methanol alcoholysis process (SRCA process), was developed by SINOPEC Research Institute of Petroleum Processing for producing biodiesel from WOFs. The technical problems that were solved included how to dissolve WOFs in methanol, how to moderate the reaction conditions, how to transform WOFs into more biodiesel, and how to improve product quality. The first industrial demonstration unit of SRCA process with a scale of 60 kton/year biodiesel was set up in 2009, and it had been operated continuously to produce biodiesel from soybean acid oil, palm acid oil, and cooking oil. The biodiesel product quality fulfil the requirements of National Standard (GB/T 20828-2007).\u9488\u5bf9\u5e9f\u5f03\u6cb9\u8102\u54c1\u8d28\u5dee,\u2005\u9178\u503c\u9ad8,\u2005\u96be\u4e8e\u91c7\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u78b1\u50ac\u5316\u916f\u4ea4\u6362\u6280\u672f\u52a0\u5de5\u751f\u4ea7\u751f\u7269\u67f4\u6cb9,\u2005\u4e2d\u56fd\u77f3\u5316\u77f3\u6cb9\u5316\u5de5\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u8d85/\u8fd1\u4e34\u754c\u7532\u9187\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u6cb9\u8102\u6eb6\u89e3\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7814\u7a76,\u2005\u76f8\u7ee7\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7532\u9187\u4e0e\u6cb9\u8102\u7684\u4e92\u6eb6\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6,\u2005\u4e09\u8102\u80aa\u9178\u7518\u6cb9\u916f\u548c\u6e38\u79bb\u8102\u80aa\u9178\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5316,\u2005\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898,\u2005\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e34\u754c\u9187\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u67f4\u6cb9\u6280\u672f\u2005(\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7b80\u79f0\u2005SRCA),\u2005\u4e8e\u20052009\u2005\u5e74\u5efa\u6210\u4e86\u20056\u2005\u4e07\u5428/\u5e74\u5de5\u4e1a\u5316\u793a\u8303\u88c5\u7f6e,\u2005\u4ee5\u9178\u5316\u6cb9\u548c\u9910\u53a8\u5e9f\u6cb9\u4e3a\u539f\u6599,\u2005\u751f\u4ea7\u8fde\u7eed\u7a33\u5b9a,\u2005\u4ea7\u54c1\u6536\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u56fd\u5bb6\u751f\u7269\u67f4\u6cb9\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u2005(GB/T 20828-2007).",

     "abstract": "Bifunctional catalysis on dual sites plays an important role in higher alcohol synthesis from syngas. It makes use of two types of active sites of which one type dissociates CO and forms surface alkyl species and the other type catalyzes non-dissociative CO adsorption for CO insertion and alcohol formation. To improve catalytic activity for higher alcohol synthesis, it is necessary to design dual sites on the atomic scale to give them high stability. The recent advances in higher alcohol synthesis using bifunctional catalysts are reviewed. The design of the dual sites, the structure of the dual sites on several typical catalyst systems, and the structural evolution of the dual sites during reaction are discussed using our latest research results.\u6df7\u5408\u9187\u5408\u6210\u8981\u6c42\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u5907\u81f3\u5c11\u4e24\u7c7b\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3,\u2005\u4e00\u7c7b\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u79bb\u5438\u9644CO\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u70f7\u57fa\u94fe,\u2005\u53e6\u4e00\u7c7b\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u89e3\u79bb\u5438\u9644CO\u4ee5\u4f7f\u70f7\u57fa\u94fe\u542b\u6c27\u5316\u751f\u6210\u9187. \u4e24\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u5171\u540c\u6784\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u9187\u5408\u6210\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53cc\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3. \u7b80\u8981\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5408\u6210\u6c14\u5236\u6df7\u5408\u9187\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u53cc\u529f\u80fd\u50ac\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55,\u2005\u5e76\u4ee5\u51e0\u7c7b\u5178\u578b\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e3a\u4f8b,\u2005\u4ece\u53cc\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6784\u7b51\u3001\u5178\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53cc\u6d3b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9610\u8ff0. \u6df7\u5408\u9187\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u5e94\u4ece\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1,\u2005\u4f7f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u7684\u53cc\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3,\u2005\u5e76\u8bbe\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u53cc\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784.",

As a result of systematic research aimed at understanding the fundamental mechanism of ultra-deep HDS catalysis, various technology for the preparation of HDS catalysts have been developed, including novel alumina supports, as well as methods for tuning the surface properties of catalysts and otherwise modifying these materials so as to improve alkyl transfer performance. The result of these improvements is that a number of ultra-deep HDS catalysts with excellent performance, such as FHUDS-5 and FHUDS-6, have been developed. In addition, parallel research work investigating the interactions between different types of HDS catalysts and different hydrotreatment reactor zones has developed stacked catalyst technology that allows for the optimization of catalytic performance, so as to meet the demands of commercial production facilities for ultra-low-sulfur diesel.\u5408\u6210\u4e865%Ni/Mn-ZnO\u5438\u9644\u5242\u4f53\u7cfb,\u2005\u5e76\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u4e0a\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86Mn\u7684\u63ba\u6742\u5bf9\u8be5\u5438\u9644\u5242\u7684\u5438\u9644\u8131\u786b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. 8%MnO\u63ba\u6742\u76845%Ni/MnO-ZnO\u5438\u9644\u5242\u6297\u70e7\u7ed3\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8,\u2005\u5e76\u4e14\u5438\u9644\u5242\u7684\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u518d\u751f\u6d3b\u6027\u5747\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8,\u2005\u4e09\u6b21\u518d\u751f\u540e\u7684\u8131\u786b\u7387\u4ecd\u6bd4\u4e00\u6b21\u518d\u751f\u7684\u65e0Mn\u63ba\u6742\u76845%Ni/ZnO\u5438\u9644\u5242\u7684\u8131\u786b\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa\u7ea64%.

     "abstract": "The effect of Mn doping on the adsorptive desulfurization performance of 5%Ni/ZnO adsorbents was investigated in model gasoline, with thiophene as a sulfur-containing compound, using a fixed-bed reactor. The 5%Ni/MnO-ZnO adsorbents with different levels of Mn doping were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that the adsorption performances of the 5%Ni/MnO-ZnO adsorbents were considerably improved after Mn doping compared with that of 5%Ni/ZnO. Moreover, the 5%NiO/MnO-ZnO adsorbents showed high desulfurization activities after regeneration. Sulfur removal by a 5%NiO/8%MnO-ZnO adsorbent after three reaction-regeneration cycles was 4% higher than that by a 5%NiO/ZnO adsorbent without Mn doping. The excellent performance of the 5%NiO/8%MnO-ZnO adsorbent in desulfurization, and its regenerability, were attributed to formation of a new compound, ZnMnO3, in the adsorbent; this compound was characterized using XRD.\u5408\u6210\u4e865%Ni/Mn-ZnO\u5438\u9644\u5242\u4f53\u7cfb,\u2005\u5e76\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u4e0a\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86Mn\u7684\u63ba\u6742\u5bf9\u8be5\u5438\u9644\u5242\u7684\u5438\u9644\u8131\u786b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. 8%MnO\u63ba\u6742\u76845%Ni/MnO-ZnO\u5438\u9644\u5242\u6297\u70e7\u7ed3\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8,\u2005\u5e76\u4e14\u5438\u9644\u5242\u7684\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u518d\u751f\u6d3b\u6027\u5747\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8,\u2005\u4e09\u6b21\u518d\u751f\u540e\u7684\u8131\u786b\u7387\u4ecd\u6bd4\u4e00\u6b21\u518d\u751f\u7684\u65e0Mn\u63ba\u6742\u76845%Ni/ZnO\u5438\u9644\u5242\u7684\u8131\u786b\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa\u7ea64%.

The hydrogenolysis of porphyrins occurred rapidly at lower temperature but higher temperatures were required for the HDN of porphyrins. The NiMoP3 catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity for the HDN of porphyrins. Based on the characterization of the supports and catalysts, it is suggested that the dispersion of Mo is improved and the number of weak acidic sites on the NiMoP catalysts increases with the addition of phosphorus.",

     "abstract": "Ni/Mo/N catalysts made to have an interstitial structure gave high catalytic activity and sulfur tolerance in the hydrotreating of coal liquid fuel to produce high performance jet fuel. The dissolving of N atoms into the metal lattices to make the interstitial structure is difficult to control, and the preparation conditions of the precursor synthesis and the crystallinity of the precursors were changed to monitor how N atoms were inserted into the metal lattice. Ni/Mo/N catalysts were prepared by a one pot synthesis using ammonium molybdate [(NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O] and nickel acetate [Ni(CH3COO)2\u00b74H2O] and the decomposition of hexamine under an argon atmosphere at 650 \u00b0C. Benzene hydrogenation was used as a model reaction to evaluate catalytic activity. Benzene was hydrogenated over the Ni/Mo/N catalyst at 250 \u00b0C and 3 MPa in a fixed bed reactor in the absence and presence of thiophene to also test the Ni/Mo/N catalysts for sulfur tolerance. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the formation of different precursors and use of different aging times affected the composition of the Ni/Mo/N catalysts, and also determined the crystal phases in the Ni/Mo/N catalysts. Ni2Mo3N, Mo2C, and Ni metal phases were present in the most active Ni/Mo/N catalyst which gave a conversion of benzene of 93% and selectivity to cyclohexane of almost 100%. The atomic ratio of Ni/Mo in the most active Ni/Mo/N catalyst was 5/4 as determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Benzene hydrogenation over the Ni/Mo/N catalyst in the presence of thiophene led to a decline in benzene conversion from 72% to 50% due to the formation of MoS2.Ni/Mo/N\u95f4\u9699\u578b\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7684\u52a0\u6c22\u6d3b\u6027\u53ca\u826f\u597d\u8010\u786b\u6027,\u2005\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7164\u6db2\u5316\u6cb9\u52a0\u6c22\u7cbe\u5236\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u55b7\u6c14\u71c3\u6599.

This was followed by formation of a Ru@Zr-MOF catalyst from RuCl3\u00b73H2O in a supercritical CO2-methanol solution. The catalyst was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, power X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermo-gravimetric analysis, N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. Ru particles with an average diameter of 2.3 nm were uniformly supported in the Zr-MOF.

Optimizing the Al and H2O amounts in the synthesis mixture, as well as the crystallization time and the acid treatment conditions applied to the as-synthesized lamellar precursors, produced a large increase in the content of Al in the Al-YNU-1 framework, to nearly double that of a sample prepared using deborated MWW as the silica source.

     "abstract": "A new method has been developed for the Pd-catalyzed direct carbonylation of indoles with phenylacetylenes. The process involved the initial iodination of the indole to afford the corresponding 3-iodo-indole, which was subsequently carbonylated with a variety of different alkynes using Pd(0) to yield the indole-3-alkynones. In contrast to the traditional Pd-catalyzed oxidative carbonylation strategy, which involves the Pd(II)-mediated activation of the aromatic C-H bonds, the aromatic C-H bonds in the current process were activated by iodine oxidation, eliminating the problems associated with the reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0) under the CO atmosphere. Following an extensive screening process, Pd(OAc)2/CuI was identified as the most efficient catalyst system for the reaction in the presence of a base and iodine as an oxidant under mild conditions (0.2 MPa CO, 90 \u00b0C). The reaction provided the desired products in moderate to excellent isolated yields (up to 94%) and good tolerance to a variety of different functional groups. The structure of a representative alkynone product (3he) was unambiguously verified by X-ray single crystal structure analysis. Furthermore, the carbonylation products underwent a three-component reaction with sodium azide and benzyl bromide to give the corresponding 1,2,3-triazole analogues in the absence of any catalyst, thus expanding the synthetic application of the current methodology.\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u5408\u6210\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0d\u540c\u7845\u6c28\u57fa\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u4ecb\u5b54\u6c27\u5316\u7845\u2005SBA-15,\u2005\u5728\u5176\u5b54\u9053\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u2005Keggin\u2005\u578b\u94a8\u78f7\u9178,\u2005\u4e14\u5176\u542b\u91cf\u968f\u7845\u6c28\u57fa\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0. \u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6742\u591a\u9178\u7684\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027,\u2005\u53d1\u73b0\u7119\u70e7\u540e\u94a8\u7269\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u2005SBA-15\u2005\u5b54\u9053\u5185\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u6563. \u4ee5\u2005H2O2\u2005\u4e3a\u6c27\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u73af\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u6742\u591a\u9178\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u548c\u7119\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005400\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684\u94a8\u78f7\u9178\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u6027\u80fd.",

     "abstract": "A series of aminosilylated mesoporous silica (SBA-15) samples with different contents of (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), synthesized using a simple one-pot method, were used as hosts for immobilization of Keggin-type 12-phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40). The loading of H3PW12O40 increased with increasing content of grafted APTES. The obtained materials were calcined at different temperatures, and the tungsten species were highly dispersed inside the SBA-15 channels.

     "abstract": "A CuO/TiO2 catalyst was prepared by impregnation and characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. Two types of dispersed species formed on the TiO2 surface, which were possibly isolated and polymeric CuO species. The CuO catalyst interacted strongly with the TiO2 support. A porous ceramic membrane was used as a distributor to control the supply of oxygen in phenol hydroxylation over the CuO/TiO2 catalyst. Compared to a direct feed of oxygen without a membrane, the yield of dihydroxybenzene (DHB) increased by 13% using a porous ceramic membrane with a pore size of 0.5 \u03bcm as an oxygen distributor. This is because the membrane distributor produced numerous small oxygen bubbles, increasing the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient and gas-liquid mass transfer. Optimizing reaction conditions resulted in a yield of DHB of 2.5%. Scanning electron microscope observation of the used ceramic membrane showed that it possessed excellent thermal and chemical stability.\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907CuO/TiO2\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5229\u7528X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005CuO\u4ee5\u5206\u6563\u6001\u548c\u6676\u4f53\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728,\u2005\u4e14\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u6709\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528. \u4ee5\u9676\u74f7\u819c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u6c27\u6c14\u7684\u8fdb\u6599,\u2005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86CuO/TiO2\u50ac\u5316\u6c27\u6c14\u6c27\u5316\u82ef\u915a\u7f9f\u57fa\u5316\u53cd\u5e94. \u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u5165\u6c27\u6c14\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u5b54\u5f84\u4e3a0.5\u00b5m\u7684\u9676\u74f7\u819c\u63a7\u5236\u8fdb\u6c27,\u2005\u53ef\u4f7f\u82ef\u4e8c\u915a\u6536\u7387\u63d0\u9ad813%,\u2005\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u91c7\u7528\u9676\u74f7\u819c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c27\u6c14\u8fdb\u6599\u5206\u5e03\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u5fae\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u6c27\u6c14\u6c14\u6ce1,\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f53\u79ef\u6eb6\u6c27\u7cfb\u6570,\u2005\u589e\u5f3a\u6c14\u6db2\u4f20\u8d28\u6548\u679c. \u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005\u82ef\u4e8c\u915a\u6536\u7387\u8fbe2.5%. \u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u7684\u9676\u74f7\u819c\u8fdb\u884c\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u53d1\u73b0\u9676\u74f7\u819c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027.",

The morphology and structure of the TiO2 single crystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 crystals for the degradation of methylene blue dye was investigated by ultraviolet light irradiation. The effects of the amounts of HF and H2O2 on the morphology of TiO2 have been studied. The reaction time and temperature have also been investigated. In the TiO2 single crystals, the {001} and {110} facets are present at the same time. The results indicated that a high yield of single crystals with exposed {110} and {110} facets could be obtained by adjusting the reaction time, reaction temperature, and amounts of HF and H2O2.

     "abstract": "The activities of the key enzymes involved in the intracellular poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV3011 were studied under various cultivation conditions. The enzymes were methane monooxygenase (MMO), \u03b2-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, PHB synthetase, and PHB depolymerase. Each enzyme had a unique catalytic mechanism. MMO activity decreased continuously with PHB production, but PHB at a high concentration was beneficial for maintaining MMO activity because more NADH was released by PHB depolymerization. The important reaction for entering the PHB cycle was catalyzed by \u03b2-ketothiolase. The monomer of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate was synthesized by the catalysis of \u03b2-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. PHB synthetase played an important role in the PHB synthesis routes. The activity of PHB synthetase increased with PHB production. The changes of enzyme activities involved in PHB synthetase and PHB depolymerase occurred together, which indicated that the polymerization and depolymerization of intracellular PHB occurred simultaneously. The molecular weight of PHB was determined mainly by the combined actions of PHB synthetase and PHB depolymerase. Some important intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were helpful for PHB production because they increased related enzyme activities in the PHB cycle.\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7532\u70f7\u5355\u52a0\u6c27\u9176\u2005(MMO)\u3001\u03b2-\u916e\u786b\u89e3\u9176\u3001\u4e59\u9170\u4e59\u9170\u2005CoA\u2005\u8fd8\u539f\u9176\u3001\u805a\u2005\u03b2-\u7f9f\u57fa\u4e01\u9178\u916f\u2005(PHB)\u2005\u5408\u6210\u9176\u53ca\u2005PHB\u2005\u964d\u89e3\u9176\u5728\u7532\u70f7\u6c27\u5316\u7ec6\u83cc\u80de\u5185\u2005PHB\u2005\u5408\u6210\u9014\u5f84\u4e2d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u4f5c\u7528. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005MMO\u2005\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u968f\u7740\u80de\u5185\u2005PHB\u2005\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\u800c\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d,\u2005\u800c\u80de\u5185\u9ad8\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u2005PHB\u2005\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u7f13\u2005MMO\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u964d\u4f4e. \u03b2-\u916e\u786b\u89e3\u9176\u63a7\u5236\u7740\u53cd\u5e94\u4f53\u7cfb\u8fdb\u5165\u2005PHB\u2005\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u5165\u53e3,\u2005\u5728\u5b83\u548c\u4e59\u9170\u4e59\u9170\u2005CoA\u2005\u8fd8\u539f\u9176\u7684\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b,\u2005\u751f\u6210\u805a\u5408\u5355\u4f53\u2005\u03b2-\u7f9f\u57fa\u4e01\u9170,\u2005\u4e8c\u8005\u6d3b\u6027\u5728\u5bf9\u6570\u751f\u957f\u671f\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c.

The use of ZrOCO3 as precursor was better suited for the formation of Ce3+ and more favorable for the homogeneous insertion of Zr4+ and La3+ into the CeO2 lattice, which resulted in better thermal stability and enhanced redox properties of the Pd/Ce0.45Zr0.45La0.1O1.95 catalyst.\u62a5\u9053\u4e86\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7518\u6cb9\u548c\u78b3\u9178\u4e8c\u7532\u916f\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u78b1\u6027\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u5408\u6210\u78b3\u9178\u7518\u6cb9\u916f\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u6784\u6548\u5173\u7cfb. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u6240\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d,\u2005NaY\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u53cd\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\u9009\u62e9\u6027; \u53e6\u5916,\u2005\u7518\u6cb9\u548c\u78b3\u9178\u4e8c\u7532\u916f\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5b54\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u5177\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u8981\u6c42,\u20053A,\u20054A\u2005\u548c\u2005NaZSM-5\u2005\u7b49\u5b54\u5f84\u8f83\u5c0f\u2005(<\u20050.6\u2005nm)\u2005\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u6ca1\u6709\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u800c\u5b54\u5f84\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u2005NaY\u2005\u548c\u2005Na\u03b2\u2005\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027.",

The experimental parameters, namely, type of electrolyte, pH value, and amount of SWCNTs casted, were optimized.

     "abstract": "Three dimensional flower-like Co-Ni/C bimetallic catalysts composed of interlaced carbon flakes with highly dispersed metal nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal/solvothermal process followed by a heat treatment in flowing N2. The sizes of the metal nanoparticles were from 26 to 4 nm, which became smaller as the Co/Ni molar ratio increased. The catalytic activities for the selective hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene to o-chloroaniline were tested. The conversion of o-chloronitrobenzene over the bimetallic Co-Ni/C catalysts was increased by up to 200% compared with that over a mono-metallic Co/C catalyst, which was due to a synergistic interaction between the Co and Ni species. Hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption results showed that new active sites were formed in the Co50Ni50/C catalyst due to the formation of a Co-Ni alloy, which gave the improved activity of the Co50Ni50/C catalyst.\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6c34\u70ed/\u6eb6\u5242\u70ed\u6cd5,\u2005\u7ecf\u540e\u7eed\u5728\u6c2e\u6c14\u6c14\u6c1b\u4e2d\u7684\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u82b1\u578b\u2005Co-Ni/C\u2005\u53cc\u91d1\u5c5e\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5b83\u7531\u4ea4\u7ec7\u70ad\u7247\u6784\u6210,\u2005\u91d1\u5c5e\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u6563\u5176\u4e2d. \u968f\u7740\u2005Co/Ni\u2005\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u7684\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u91d1\u5c5e\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u7c92\u5f84\u9010\u6e10\u4ece\u200526\u2005nm\u2005\u51cf\u81f3\u20054\u2005nm\u2005\u5de6\u53f3. \u5c06\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7528\u4e8e\u90bb\u6c2f\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u52a0\u6c22\u5236\u5907\u90bb\u6c2f\u82ef\u80fa\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u4e3a\u5355\u91d1\u5c5e\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u20052\u2005\u500d. \u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u2005Co\u2005\u548c\u2005Ni\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94. \u6c22\u6c14\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a,\u2005Co/Ni\u2005\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4f7f\u5f97\u2005Co50Ni50/C\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4d,\u2005\u56e0\u800c\u5176\u6d3b\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8.",

     "abstract": "A series of modified HEU-1 zeolites were prepared using hydrochloric acid treatment, hydrothermal treatment, and a combination of these. The parent and modified HEU-1 zeolites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray fluorescence, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine, and 27Al solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The catalytic cracking performances of the modified HEU-1 zeolites were evaluated on a fixed-bed microreactor at 625 \u00b0C, atmospheric pressure, and an n-hexane weight hourly space velocity of 2.0 h\u22121. The results showed that extra-framework alumina could be removed by directly treating with hydrochloric acid, and framework alumina could be removed by hydrothermal treatment. Acidity characterization showed that the weak acid sites of HEU-1 zeolites could be adjusted using acid treatment, and the number of strong acid sites could be reduced using hydrothermal treatment. The framework nSi:nAl ratio was improved by using a combination of hydrothermal treatment and acid leaching. The acidities of the HEU-1 zeolites were adjusted and both the mesopore volume and external surface area were enhanced. In n-hexane cracking reactions, the dealuminated HEU-1 zeolite obtained by hydrothermal treatment for 4 h at 600 \u00b0C and then washing with hydrochloric acid exhibited the highest propylene production as a result of suppression of the hydrogen transfer reaction. At 625 \u00b0C, the selectivity for propylene on HEU-1(HT4-HCl) increased to 35.2% from 21.9%, and the lifetime of HEU-1(HT4-HCl) was also prolonged from not more than 10 to 40 h.\u91c7\u7528\u2005HCl\u2005\u6eb6\u6db2\u548c/\u6216\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u2005HEU-1\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u3001NH3\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u3001\u5421\u5576\u5438\u9644\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u94dd\u56fa\u4f53\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u7b49\u5bf9\u8131\u94dd\u5904\u7406\u7684\u2005HEU-1\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u8131\u94dd\u2005HEU-1\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e0a\u6b63\u5df1\u70f7\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u88c2\u89e3\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u2005HCl\u2005\u6eb6\u6db2\u5904\u7406\u2005HEU-1\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b,\u2005\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8131\u9664\u975e\u9aa8\u67b6\u94dd,\u2005\u53ef\u8c03\u53d8\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u5f31\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3; \u800c\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u2005HEU-1\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b,\u2005\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8131\u9664\u9aa8\u67b6\u94dd,\u2005\u53ef\u8c03\u53d8\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u5f3a\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3. \u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u548c\u2005HCl\u2005\u6eb6\u6db2\u5904\u7406\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u65f6\u8c03\u53d8\u2005HEU-1\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7684\u9178\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u9178\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u76ee\u7684. \u8131\u94dd\u2005HEU-1\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e0a\u6b63\u5df1\u70f7\u50ac\u5316\u88c2\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u6c22\u8f6c\u79fb\u53cd\u5e94\u88ab\u660e\u663e\u6291\u5236,\u2005\u4e19\u70ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8. 600\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u540e\u518d\u7528\u2005HCl\u2005\u6eb6\u6db2\u5904\u7406\u7684\u2005HEU-1\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e8e\u2005625\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u4e19\u70ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7531\u672a\u6539\u6027\u7684\u200521.9%\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u200535.2%,\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e5f\u7531\u4e0d\u8db3\u200510\u2005h\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u200540\u2005h.",

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to determine the dispersion of Pt. For the Pt/CeO2 catalysts, XRD studies suggest that Pt was better dispersed as its concentration decreased. This observation correlated well with XPS analysis. For catalysts with the same Pt mass loading, TEM and XRD results suggest that Pt dispersion displays an increasing order as Pt/SiO2 < Pt/\u03b3-Al2O3 < Pt/CeO2.

     "abstract": "A Ru-[bmim]BF4 catalyst was prepared in a mixture of the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim]BF4) and H2O using NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The Ru-[bmim]BF4 catalyst showed higher selectivity for cyclohexene than a catalyst reduced by N2H4\u00b7H2O because of the influence of boron. When Ru-[bmim]BF4 was reused, higher activity and lower selectivity were obtained because the number of Ru active sites increased through leaching of the ionic liquid. The used catalyst also contained ZnOHF formed in the reaction between F\u2212 and ZnSO4, which was an additive in the reaction. Under the influence of the ionic liquid as a template, ZnOHF grew along the (001) direction and exhibited rod-like morphology.\u5728\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u20051-\u4e01\u57fa-3-\u7532\u57fa\u54aa\u5511\u56db\u6c1f\u787c\u9178\u76d0\u2005([bmim]BF4)-\u6c34\u6df7\u5408\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d,\u2005\u4ee5\u2005NaBH4\u2005\u4e3a\u8fd8\u539f\u5242\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Ru-[bmim]BF4\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u82ef\u9009\u62e9\u52a0\u6c22\u53cd\u5e94. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u2005N2H4\u00b7H2O\u2005\u8fd8\u539f\u5236\u5907\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u672c\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027,\u2005\u5f53\u82ef\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u4e3a\u200549.5%\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53ef\u8fbe\u200534.1%,\u2005\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u787c\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u6240\u81f4. \u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6,\u2005\u7531\u4e8e\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u6d41\u5931,\u2005\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u2005Ru\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u589e\u591a,\u2005\u56e0\u800c\u82ef\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u5347\u9ad8,\u2005\u4f46\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e0b\u964d,\u2005\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u2005ZnOHF. \u8fd9\u662f\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u4e2d\u2005F\u2013\u4e0e\u2005ZnSO4\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u800c\u5f97; \u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b,\u2005ZnOHF\u2005\u6cbf\u7740\u2005(001)\u2005\u65b9\u5411\u751f\u957f,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u68d2\u72b6\u5f62\u8c8c.",

The modified electrode showed good electrocatalytic activity for the anodic oxidation of isoprenaline, which was due to a substantial decrease in the anodic overpotential. Under the optimum conditions, measurements using square wave voltammetry had a linear range in the range of 0.3 to 125.0 \u03bcmol/L of isoprenaline and a detection limit of 0.1 \u03bcmol/L. The diffusion coefficient and kinetic parameters were determined using electrochemical methods. The relative standard deviation for seven successive assays of 1.0 and 20.0 \u03bcmol/L isoprenaline were 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively.

In addition, BiMnO3 was also resistant to water vapor and a mixture of H2O and SO2.\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u2005CuO\u2005\u4e0e\u2005\u5435-Al2O3\u2005\u548c\u2005CeO2\u2005\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528,\u2005\u5e76\u7531\u6b64\u5236\u5907\u51fa\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8131\u9664\u2005CO,\u2005C3H6\u2005\u548c\u2005NO\u2005\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8f7d\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u2005CuO\u2005\u7c07\u7684\u5206\u6563\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8010\u8001\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u968f\u2005CuO\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0,\u2005CuO\u2005\u7c07\u56e0\u4e0e\u2005CeO2\u2005\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b58\u5728; \u800c\u5728\u2005\u5435-Al2O3\u2005\u8868\u9762,\u2005CuO\u2005\u7c07\u6613\u805a\u96c6\u6210\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u9897\u7c92. \u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762,\u2005\u7531\u4e8e\u2005CeO2\u2005\u672c\u8eab\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027,\u2005\u8868\u9762\u5206\u6563\u7684\u2005CuO\u2005\u5728\u2005950\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u9ad8\u6e29\u5904\u7406\u540e\u70e7\u7ed3. \u56e0\u6b64,\u2005\u57fa\u4e8e\u2005\u5435-Al2O3\u2005\u8f7d\u4f53\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8010\u8001\u5316\u6027\u80fd,\u2005\u5728\u2005\u5435-Al2O3\u2005\u8f7d\u4f53\u5206\u6563\u2005CeO2,\u2005\u7136\u540e\u518d\u62c5\u8f7d\u2005CuO,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u2005CuO\u2005\u7c07,\u2005\u6240\u5f97\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6bd4\u2005CuO/\u5435-A12O3\u2005\u548c\u2005CuO/CeO2\u2005\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6297\u70ed\u8001\u5316\u6027\u80fd.",

     "abstract": "A strong interaction between a metal oxide and support has long been indicative of its promotion of catalytic activities. In connection with this, we investigated the interaction of CuO with \u03b3-Al2O3 and CeO2 for producing highly efficient catalysts for CO, C3H6, and NO abatement. In particular, the dispersion and thermal aging resistance of CuO clusters on different supports were studied. CuO clusters can be stabilized by interaction with CeO2, while on \u03b3-Al2O3 they aggregated into larger particles at high CuO loadings. On the other hand, due to the poor thermal stability of CeO2, CuO clusters dispersed on it were sintered during an aging treatment at 950 \u00b0C. Accordingly, by pre-dispersing CeO2 on \u03b3-Al2O3 followed by CuO dispersion, stabilized CuO clusters were obtained that were based on the superior aging resistance of the \u03b3-Al2O3 support. Therefore, better catalytic performance and thermal aging properties were obtained with a CuO/CeO2/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst as compared with CuO/\u03b3-Al2O3 and CuO/CeO2 samples.\u4ee5\u6c34\u5408\u80bc\u4e3a\u8fd8\u539f\u5242,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u785d\u9178 \u76d0\u9178 \u786b\u9178\u53ca\u6c2e\u6c14\u6216\u6c22\u6c14\u6c1b\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u8fd8\u539f\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd.\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u7ecf\u5316\u5b66\u5904\u7406\u540e,\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u542b\u6c27\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2,\u2005\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u5f15\u53d1\u6c34\u5408\u80bc\u5206\u89e3,\u2005\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u7684\u5438\u9644. \u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u542b\u6c27\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2\u8d8a\u591a,\u2005\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u8fd8\u539f\u901f\u7387\u8d8a\u5feb. \u5176\u4e2d\u7ecf\u76d0\u9178\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u542b\u6c27\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2\u6700\u591a,\u2005\u56e0\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u8fd8\u539f\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "Activated carbons, which were modified by chemical treatment in aqueous solutions of HNO3, HCl, and H2SO4 or in gaseous N2 and H2, have been tested as catalysts in the reduction of nitrobenzene using hydrazine hydrate as hydrogen donor. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and Boehm titration reveal that the chemical treatment leads to the formation of various oxygen functional groups on the surface of the activated carbon. These oxygen functional groups can induce the decomposition of hydrazine hydrate and influence the adsorption of nitrobenzene on the surface of the activated carbon. The catalytic activity is correlated to that of the oxygen functional groups, which suggests that an abundance of surface oxygen functional groups is favourable for this reaction. The activated carbon treated by hydrochloric acid had the largest amount of oxygen functional groups and exhibited the highest activity for nitrobenzene reduction to aniline.\u4ee5\u6c34\u5408\u80bc\u4e3a\u8fd8\u539f\u5242,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u785d\u9178 \u76d0\u9178 \u786b\u9178\u53ca\u6c2e\u6c14\u6216\u6c22\u6c14\u6c1b\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u8fd8\u539f\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd.\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u7ecf\u5316\u5b66\u5904\u7406\u540e,\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u542b\u6c27\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2,\u2005\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u5f15\u53d1\u6c34\u5408\u80bc\u5206\u89e3,\u2005\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u7684\u5438\u9644. \u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u542b\u6c27\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2\u8d8a\u591a,\u2005\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u8fd8\u539f\u901f\u7387\u8d8a\u5feb. \u5176\u4e2d\u7ecf\u76d0\u9178\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u542b\u6c27\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2\u6700\u591a,\u2005\u56e0\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u8fd8\u539f\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "A Ni/MgO catalyst for CO2 reforming of toluene was prepared by impregnating MgO with Ni(NO3)2. During calcination, some of the NiO diffused into the MgO and formed a solid solution structure of NiO-MgO, which was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. In the temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen analysis, only a small part of the Ni species in the outermost layer was reduced to metallic Ni at 700 \u00b0C. The calcination temperature played a key role in determining the subsequent catalytic activity of Ni/MgO, consequently the catalyst calcined at 600 \u00b0C had the highest activity. This catalyst also had the highest surface concentration of reduced Ni, which probably accounted for its high activity. During the reforming tests, a small amount of coke was deposited on Ni/MgO catalyst. Polyaromatic compounds were observed by Raman spectroscopy.

     "abstract": "A series of WO3-modified MnOx/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by three different impregnation methods and were investigated by specific surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, laser Raman spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The three-component catalysts obtained with the one-step impregnation exhibited the best catalytic activity. The characterization data revealed that a synergism between tungsten and manganese oxide existed in the catalysts when tungsten was loaded either prior to or simultaneously with manganese, which made the active components better dispersed and blocked the transformation of TiO2 from the anatase to rutile structure. The manganese oxide existed in the form of Mn2O3 on all the samples but was accompanied by a small amount of MnO2 for 15%MnOx\u22125%WO3/TiO2. WO3 improved the reducibility and enhanced the amount and strength of the surface acid sites, especially the Br\u00f6nsted acid sites and promoted the formation of the active intermediate ((NH2). Lewis acid sites had the major role in the low temperature selective catalytic reduction reaction while surface (NH2 was an important intermediate species.\u91c7\u7528\u20053\u2005\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6d78\u6e0d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u7cfb\u5217\u2005WO3\u2005\u6539\u6027\u2005MnOx/TiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u2005BET\u2005\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u6d4b\u8bd5 X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04 \u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31 H2\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f \u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u548c\u539f\u4f4d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a,\u2005\u4e00\u6b65\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u548c\u5148\u94a8\u540e\u9530\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d,\u2005Mn\u2005\u548c\u2005W\u2005\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d3b\u6027\u7ec4\u5206\u7684\u5206\u6563\u72b6\u6001,\u2005\u5e76\u963b\u6b62\u4e86\u949b\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u8f6c\u6676; \u5728\u6240\u6709\u7684\u2005Mn\u2005\u57fa\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d,\u2005Mn\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u4ee5\u2005Mn2O3\u2005\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728,\u2005\u4f46\u5728\u200515%MnOx-5%WO3/TiO2\u2005\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u5c11\u91cf\u7684\u2005MnO2; WO3\u2005\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u5927\u5927\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u8fd8\u539f\u80fd\u529b,\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5176\u8868\u9762\u9178\u4f4d\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u2005B\u2005\u9178\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6,\u2005\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u95f4\u7269\u2005(-NH2)\u2005\u7684\u751f\u6210. \u8868\u9762\u2005Lewis\u2005\u9178\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u2005SCR\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u8d77\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u7528,\u2005\u5e76\u4e14\u53d1\u73b0-NH2\u2005\u4e5f\u662f\u6d3b\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u7269\u79cd. \u5728\u2005NH3\u2005\u4f4e\u6e29\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u2005NO\u2005\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d,\u2005\u4e00\u6b65\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u9ad8.",

The development of new catalysts and materials is essential for new technologies for various environmental applications. Ceramics play important roles in various environmental applications including the identification, monitoring, and quantification of pollutants and their control. Ceramics have important applications as sensors and photocatalysts, and they are extensively used as catalyst carriers and supports. Many ceramics are being explored as catalysts for pollution control applications. Their low cost, thermal and chemical stability, and capability of being tailored make them especially attractive for pollution control applications. Although a wide variety of materials have been developed as catalyst supports, this area is still of interest with new or modified catalyst supports being frequently reported. It is of equal importance to develop new or modified processes for the loading of catalysts on specific supports. Applications like chemical looping combustion (CLC) and other catalytic combustion processes are raising the demands to a new scale. We have been working on the development of both new and modified support materials, including mesoporous materials without structural order for possible applications in CLC and other catalytic reactions. Successful attempts have been made in the modification of conventional \u03b3-Al2O3 and improved synthesis processes for supporting perovskite type catalysts. Our research on environmental catalysis applications of ceramic materials and processes are also briefly discussed.",

     "abstract": "Phenol is widely used in industry. The hydroxylation of benzene to phenol can meet the increasing requirement for phenol and green chemistry. Commercial wood-based activated carbon was treated by different methods, including oxidation by nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide and thermal treatment at different temperatures, and used as the catalyst for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol in acetonitrile using H2O2 as oxidant. The mechanism of the hydroxylation was also investigated. The activated carbon samples were characterized by Boehm titration, nitrogen adsorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The pH had a significant effect on the phenol yield. The effect of benzene adsorption was also investigated. Several model compounds with oxygen groups were used as catalysts for the hydroxylation of benzene. The reaction between phenolic hydroxyl and quinone on the surface of activated carbon was responsible for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol when it activated H2O2 to form the hydroxyl radical. Activated carbon was an efficient and stable catalyst and a maximum phenol yield of 14.4% was obtained under the optimal reaction conditions.\u5c06\u5e02\u552e\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u7ecf\u8fc7\u785d\u9178 \u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u6c22\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7528\u4e8e\u82ef\u7684\u7f9f\u57fa\u5316\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u50ac\u5316\u82ef\u7f9f\u57fa\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u7406. \u7528\u2005Boehm\u2005\u6ef4\u5b9a,\u2005N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u53ca\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u5bf9\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u2005pH\u2005\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5f71\u54cd,\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u5bf9\u82ef\u7684\u5438\u9644\u53d7\u8868\u9762\u542b\u6c27\u57fa\u56e2\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u6a21\u578b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8868\u9762\u7684\u915a\u7f9f\u57fa\u548c\u7fb0\u57fa\u662f\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4d,\u2005\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u76f8\u4e92\u8f6c\u5316,\u2005\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u2005pH\u2005\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u8861,\u2005\u8be5\u8f6c\u5316\u4f7f\u5f97\u2005H2O2\u2005\u6d3b\u5316\u4e3a\u7f9f\u57fa\u81ea\u7531\u57fa,\u2005\u8fdb\u800c\u4e0e\u82ef\u53cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u82ef\u915a. \u5728\u82ef\u7f9f\u57fa\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d,\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u70ad\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd,\u2005\u82ef\u915a\u6536\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe\u200514.4%.",

     "abstract": "H2S adsorption and reaction on CeO2, TiO2, and ?-Al2O3 were studied by temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR). Ceria had the best desulfidation ability. The pretreatment atmosphere affected H2S adsorption and reaction on ceria, and desulfidation efficiency increased in the order of inert atmosphere, reducing atmosphere, oxidizing atmosphere. H2S was first adsorbed on pretreated ceria at room temperature. On increasing the temperature in an Ar (99.99%) atmosphere, part of the H2S desorbed below 673 K, and another part reacted with the surface oxygen on ceria to produce sulfur and water below 473 K, and SO2 between 473 and 673 K, which further reacted with lattice oxygen and was transformed into sulfate above 673 K.

     "abstract": "The effects of metal additives (Zn, Fe, Cu, and Sn) on the properties and catalytic performance of a Co/SiO2 catalyst (prepared by a co-precipitation method) in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of ethyl lactate were investigated. The electronic properties and surface distribution of Co in the catalyst were significantly changed by incorporation of the additives. The particle size of the cobalt species was reduced, which strengthened the interaction between the cobalt particles and the silica support and decreased the reducibility of the catalyst. As a consequence, both ethyl lactate conversion and 1,2-propanediol selectivity decreased upon incorporation of the additives. Ethyl lactate conversion was related less to the size and surface area of the catalyst particles than to the distribution of the cobalt species and the reducibility of the catalyst.\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u5bdf\u2005Co/SiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u6d3b\u6027\u7ec4\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u4e73\u9178\u916f\u6db2\u76f8\u6c22\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u7ed3\u679c,\u2005\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7b2c\u4e8c\u91d1\u5c5e\u6dfb\u52a0\u7269\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u968f\u7740\u91d1\u5c5e\u6dfb\u52a0\u7269\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u53cc\u91d1\u5c5e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u91d1\u5c5e\u2005Co\u2005\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316,\u2005\u800c\u2005Co\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u9897\u7c92\u7c92\u5f84\u4e0d\u65ad\u51cf\u5c0f,\u2005\u56e0\u6b64\u2005Co\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u548c\u8f7d\u4f53\u2005SiO2\u2005\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u5f3a,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u2005Co\u2005\u8fd8\u539f\u5ea6. \u4e73\u9178\u916f\u6c22\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u6d3b\u6027\u7ec4\u5206\u7684\u9897\u7c92\u5927\u5c0f\u53ca\u5176\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u4ee5\u53ca\u2005Co\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u8fd8\u539f\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u5747\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u6c22\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "(R)-2-Hydroxy-4-phenylbutyrate (HPBE) is an important chiral intermediate for the synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Asymmetric reduction of ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenyl-butyrate (OPBE) to (R)-HPBE using a recombinant strain can provide high enantioselectivity. Cofactor regeneration is a critical issue in the application of a recombinant strain. A carbonyl reductase gene (iolS) and a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) gene from Bacillus subtilis were cloned. Recombinant IolS was purified using a Ni-NTA column and its enzyme activity properties were investigated. The purified IolS exhibited maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 30\u00b0C, and the enzyme showed good thermostability below 40 \u00b0C. It retained over 75% of its activity in the acidic pH range of 5.5(7.0. Three coexpression strategies were used for the recombinant vectors. The recombinant E. coli strain containing polycistronic plasmid pET-G-T7-I showed excellent carbonyl reductase activity, and the specific activity of both IolS and GDH in the crude cell extract reached 1.5 U/mg. In the asymmetric reduction of OPBE by recombinant E. coli cells in aqueous system, the yield of (R)-HPBE reached over 99% with an enantiomeric excess of 99.5% at 10 g/L of OPBE within 15 h.\u514b\u9686\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u67af\u8349\u82bd\u5b62\u6746\u83cc\u7684\u7fb0\u57fa\u8fd8\u539f\u9176\u57fa\u56e0\u2005IolS\u2005\u548c\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\u8131\u6c22\u9176\u57fa\u56e0\u2005GDH,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u2005Ni-NTA\u2005\u954d\u4eb2\u548c\u5c42\u6790\u67f1\u5bf9\u91cd\u7ec4\u86cb\u767d\u2005IolS\u2005\u8fdb\u884c\u7eaf\u5316,\u2005\u5e76\u5bf9\u7eaf\u9176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9176\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7814\u7a76. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u8be5\u7fb0\u57fa\u8fd8\u539f\u9176\u7684\u6700\u9002\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u2005pH\u2005\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u200530\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u548c\u20056.0; \u5728\u200540\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027; \u5728\u2005pH\u20055.5-7.0\u2005\u7684\u504f\u9178\u6027\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u200575%\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u9176\u6d3b. \u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u2005IolS\u2005\u548c\u2005GDH\u2005\u7684\u5171\u8868\u8fbe\u91cd\u7ec4\u8d28\u7c92,\u2005\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u542f\u52a8\u5b50\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u8d28\u7c92\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fb0\u57fa\u8fd8\u539f\u9176\u2005IolS\u2005\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8868\u8fbe,\u2005\u7c97\u9176\u6db2\u4e2d\u7684\u2005IolS\u2005\u548c\u2005GDH\u2005\u7684\u6bd4\u9176\u6d3b\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u20051.5\u2005U/mg. \u8fd0\u7528\u8be5\u91cd\u7ec4\u83cc\u5bf9\u200510\u2005g/L\u2005\u7684\u2005OPBE\u2005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8fd8\u539f,\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u200515\u2005h\u2005\u540e,\u2005\u5e95\u7269\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u5927\u4e8e\u200599%,\u2005\u4ea7\u7269\u2005(R)-2-\u7f9f\u57fa-4-\u82ef\u57fa\u4e01\u9178\u4e59\u916f\u7684\u2005ee\u2005\u503c\u8fbe\u5230\u200599.5%.",

     "abstract": "Highly crystalline nitrogen doped mesoporous TiO2 photocatalysts were fabricated by the sol-gel method using tetrabutyl titanate as the Ti source, urea as the N source, and polyacrylamide (PAM) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the templates, and then by calcining in nitrogen and air. The photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. When the mass ratio of PAM and PEG was 1:4, the sample prepared by calcining at 600 \u00b0C in nitrogen and 500 \u00b0C in air had the anatase phase and a mesoporous structure and high crystallinity. The average pore size, crystallite size, and specific surface area were 5.11 nm, 12.5 nm, and 110.8 m2/g, respectively. Nitrogen atoms were incorporated into the TiO2 lattice mainly as substitutional N and molecularly chemisorbed \u03b3-N2, and a small amount of interstitial N. Nitrogen doping narrowed the band gap and allowed light absorption in the visible light region. Compared with undoped mesoporous TiO2, the absorption band edge of nitrogen doped samples exhibited a red shift and the light absorption intensity was increased. Photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange showed that the nitrogen doped mesoporous TiO2 had a higher photocatalytic activity than undoped mesoporous TiO2 under visible light.\u4ee5\u949b\u9178\u4e01\u916f\u4e3a\u949b\u6e90,\u2005\u5c3f\u7d20\u4e3a\u6c2e\u6e90,\u2005\u805a\u4e19\u70ef\u9170\u80fa\u2005(PAM)\u2005\u548c\u805a\u4e59\u4e8c\u9187\u2005(PEG)\u2005\u4e3a\u590d\u5408\u6a21\u677f\u5242,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u6eb6\u80f6-\u51dd\u80f6\u6cd5,\u2005\u5728\u6c2e\u6c14\u548c\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c14\u6c1b\u4e2d\u5206\u6bb5\u7145\u70e7,\u2005\u5236\u5f97\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6676\u5ea6\u6c2e\u63ba\u6742\u4ecb\u5b54\u2005TiO2\u2005\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u5229\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04 \u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644 X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u548c\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5f53\u2005PAM\u2005\u548c\u2005PEG\u2005\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e3a\u20051:4\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u5148\u5728\u6c2e\u6c14\u4e2d\u2005600\u2005\u4e30C\u2005\u7145\u70e7,\u2005\u540e\u5728\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u2005500\u2005\u4e30C\u2005\u7145\u70e7\u6240\u5f97\u6837\u54c1\u662f\u9510\u949b\u77ff\u76f8,\u2005\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b54\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7ed3\u6676\u5ea6,\u2005\u5e73\u5747\u5b54\u5f84\u4e3a\u20055.11\u2005nm,\u2005\u6676\u7c92\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e3a\u200512.5\u2005nm,\u2005\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u2005110.8\u2005m2/g. \u63ba\u6742\u4ecb\u5b54\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u6c2e\u4e3b\u8981\u4ee5\u53d6\u4ee3\u6c2e\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u5438\u9644\u5206\u5b50\u2005\u5435-N2\u2005\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728,\u2005\u5c11\u91cf\u4ee5\u95f4\u9699\u6c2e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728. \u6c2e\u63ba\u6742\u4f7f\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u53d8\u7a84,\u2005\u5438\u6536\u5e26\u8fb9\u660e\u663e\u7ea2\u79fb,\u2005\u4e14\u4f7f\u5149\u5438\u6536\u5f3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5927. \u5149\u50ac\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u7532\u57fa\u6a59\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u4e0e\u672a\u63ba\u6742\u6837\u54c1\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005\u6c2e\u63ba\u6742\u4ecb\u5b54\u2005TiO2\u2005\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "Studies on the use of gas phase applications of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in photocatalysis are scarce although their photocatalytic decomposition kinetics of environmental pollutants are likely different from those in aqueous solutions. The present study evaluated the use of chips of visible light LEDs to irradiate nitrogen doped titania (N-TiO2) prepared by hydrolysis to decompose gaseous benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, and o-xylene. Photocatalysts calcined at different temperatures were characterized by various analytical instruments. The degradation efficiency of benzene was close to zero for all conditions. For the other compounds, a conventional 8 W daylight lamp/N-TiO2 unit gave a higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency as compared with that of visible-LED/N-TiO2 units. However, the ratios of degradation efficiency to electric power consumption were higher for the photocatalytic units that used two types of visible-LED lamps (blue and white LEDs). The highest degradation efficiency was observed with the use of a calcination temperature of 350 \u00b0C. The average degradation efficiencies for toluene, ethyl benzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, and o-xylene were 35%, 68%, 94%, and 93%, respectively. The use of blue- and white-LEDs, high light intensity, and low initial concentrations gave high photocatalytic activities for the photocatalytic units using visible-LEDs. The morphological and optical properties of the photocatalysts were correlated to explain the dependence of photocatalytic activity on calcination temperature. The results suggest that visible-LEDs are energy efficient light source for photocatalytic gas phase applications, but the activity depends on the operational conditions.",

The obtained Ba-ZrO2 and catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption. The effect of Ba content on the structure and catalytic activity of K-Ru/Ba-ZrO2 catalysts is discussed. The formation of BaZrO3 can improve significantly the catalytic activity of Ru/Ba-ZrO2 for ammonia synthesis. The ammonia concentration and rate of ammonia synthesis of the K-Ru/Ba-ZrO2 catalyst (molar ratio of Ba: Zr is 1:1) were 9.24% and 29.77 mmol/(g\u00b7h), respectively, at 425\u00b0C, 5.0 MPa, and 10000 h\u22121.

     "abstract": "Ni2P/SiO2 was pretreated with a 0.8% H2O\u201399.2% H2 flow at 303, 514, and 543 K. The Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts before and after treatment were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, H2 temperature-programmed desorption, and in situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and their activities in the hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene (CB) were tested in a fix-bed reactor. There was no difference in BET specific surface area, pore structure, the Ni2P crystallite size, the Ni content, and the Ni/P ratio for the Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts before and after treatment. The treatment at 303 K did not decrease the density of exposed Ni sites on Ni2P/SiO2, while the treatment at 514 and 543 K led to the decrease of exposed Ni sites and the increase of the P-OH groups on Ni2P/SiO2. Under the conditions of 513 K, the CB space velocity of 3.75 ml/(g\u00b7h), and the H2/CB molar ratio of 9.0, the initial CB conversions on the treated Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts exceeded 93.8%, which was much higher than that (5.6%) on the untreated one. The promotion effect of steam treatment on the activity of Ni2P/SiO2 may be related to a synergism between the Ni sites and the P-OH groups.\u5728\u2005303,\u2005514\u2005\u548c\u2005543\u2005K\u2005\u4e0b\u7528\u20050.8%H2O-99.2%H2\u2005\u5bf9\u2005Ni2P/SiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u5904\u7406,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u2005N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u7535\u611f\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u3001H2\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u53ca\u539f\u4f4d\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u5904\u7406\u524d\u540e\u2005Ni2P/SiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u5728\u5e38\u538b\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6c2f\u82ef\u52a0\u6c22\u8131\u6c2f\u6d3b\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u7ecf\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u5904\u7406\u540e,\u2005Ni2P/SiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u7269\u76f8\u53ca\u5143\u7d20\u7ec4\u6210\u3001Ni2P\u2005\u6676\u7c92\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u53ca\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6539\u53d8. \u4e0e\u672a\u5904\u7406\u548c\u2005303\u2005K\u2005\u5904\u7406\u7684\u2005Ni2P/SiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0d\u540c,\u2005513\u2005\u548c\u2005543\u2005K\u2005\u5904\u7406\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u2005Ni\u2005\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11,\u2005\u8868\u9762\u2005P\u2013OH\u2005\u57fa\u56e2\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u591a. \u5728\u2005513\u2005K,\u2005\u6c2f\u82ef\u7a7a\u901f\u20053.75\u2005ml/(g\u00b7h)\u2005\u53ca\u2005H2\u2005\u548c\u6c2f\u82ef\u7684\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u4e3a\u20059.0\u2005\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005\u7ecf\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u5904\u7406\u7684\u2005Ni2P/SiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u6c2f\u82ef\u521d\u59cb\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u200593.8%,\u2005\u7ea6\u662f\u672a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u200517\u2005\u500d. \u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u2005Ni\u2005\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u8868\u9762\u2005P\u2013OH\u2005\u57fa\u56e2\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u5173.",

Cerium incorporated AlPO-5 with different Al/Ce ratios were synthesized, and the vapor phase oxidation of diphenylmethane in air over these catalysts was studied at 250, 275, 300, 325, and 350\u00b0C. The diphenylmethane conversion and selectivity for benzophenone were more than 90%. CeAlPO-5(25) was found to be more active than other catalysts. The stability of the catalyst was verified by the time on stream study which indicated steady diphenylmethane conversion and benzophenone selectivity. Hence framework incorporated CeAlPO-5 molecular sieves are stable and active catalysts for the selective oxidation of diphenylmethane.",

     "abstract": "Using well-dispersed Ta2O5 microspheres as supports, which were prepared by controlling the hydrolysis rates of tantalum ethoxide via the formation of glycolate in an acetone-water mixture, dispersible heterostructured In2O3/Ta2O5 composites were fabricated for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulant solar light irradiation. The compositions, structure, morphologies, and optical absorption properties of these composites were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The results show that in the as-prepared heterostructured In2O3/Ta2O5 composites, In2O3 nanoparticles are well distributed on the surface of Ta2O5 microspheres with a clear interface between the two phases. The incorporation of In2O3 extends the light absorption range and restricts photogenerated charge-carrier recombination, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution.\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u4e59\u9187\u94bd\u7684\u6c34\u89e3\u901f\u7387,\u2005\u5728\u4e19\u916e\u6c34\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u53ef\u5206\u6563\u7684\u2005Ta2O5\u2005\u5fae\u7403,\u2005\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u2005In2O3/Ta2O5\u2005\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u590d\u5408\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf\u8272\u6563\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7c89\u672b\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u5f62\u8c8c\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5149\u5438\u6536\u6027\u8d28\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005In2O3\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u2005Ta2O5\u2005\u5fae\u7403\u8868\u9762,\u2005\u4e14\u4e24\u76f8\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u754c\u9762,\u2005\u540c\u65f6\u2005In2O3\u2005\u7684\u590d\u5408\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u2005Ta2O5\u2005\u7684\u5149\u5438\u6536\u8303\u56f4,\u2005\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5149\u751f\u7535\u5b50\u4e0e\u7a7a\u7a74\u7684\u5206\u79bb,\u2005\u4f7f\u590d\u5408\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u592a\u9633\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5149\u89e3\u6c34\u5236\u6c22\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "Partial substitution of La3+ by Sr2+ in LaFeO3 resulted in significant changes in its structure and catalytic activity. The perovskite structure was changed from orthorhombic in LaFeO3 to nearly cubic in La0.8Sr0.2FeO3. Replacement of La3+ by Sr2+ induced a positive charge deficiency that was compensated for by the oxidation of some Fe3+ to Fe4+ and the generation of oxygen vacancies, which greatly promoted the reducibility of the perovskite. La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 gave considerably enhanced activity in CO oxidation and methane combustion because the oxygen vacancies accelerated the dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the surface in CO oxidation and facilitated the diffusion of lattice oxygen from the bulk to the surface during CH4 combustion.Sr2+\u5bf9\u2005La3+\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53d6\u4ee3\u5bfc\u81f4\u2005LaFeO3\u2005\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316. \u9499\u949b\u77ff\u7ed3\u6784\u7531\u2005LaFeO3\u2005\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u578b\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u2005La0.8Sr0.2FeO3\u2005\u7684\u8fd1\u7acb\u65b9\u578b. \u7531\u4e8e\u7535\u8377\u8865\u507f\u6548\u5e94,\u2005Sr2+\u53d6\u4ee3\u2005La3+\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u5206\u2005Fe3+\u6c27\u5316\u4e3a\u2005Fe4+,\u2005\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u6c27\u7a7a\u7a74,\u2005\u56e0\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u2005La0.8Sr0.2FeO3\u2005\u7684\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u80fd. \u7531\u4e8e\u6c27\u7a7a\u7a74\u7684\u4f5c\u7528,\u2005La0.8Sr0.2FeO3\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u2005CO\u2005\u6c27\u5316\u548c\u2005CH4\u2005\u71c3\u70e7\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u2005LaFeO3\u2005\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u5728\u2005CO\u2005\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d,\u2005\u6c27\u7a7a\u7a74\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u5438\u9644\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u6c14\u76f8\u6c27\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u89e3\u79bb; \u800c\u5728\u2005CH4\u2005\u71c3\u70e7\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d,\u2005\u6c27\u7a7a\u7a74\u5219\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6676\u683c\u6c27\u7269\u79cd\u4ece\u4f53\u76f8\u5230\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6269\u6563.",

Two carbon materials (an activated carbon and a metallurgical coke), mixtures of the carbon materials and Fe-rich slag, and mixtures of the carbon materials and Ni/Al2O3 were tested as catalysts. The mixtures of slag with carbons gave rise to higher and steadier conversions than those achieved over the carbon materials alone. In addition, the use of the metallurgical coke mixed with metal-rich catalysts gave rise to remarkable results. Thus, no CH4 and CO2 conversions were achieved when coke was used alone, whereas high conversions were obtained when it was mixed with the metal-rich catalysts.",

The results indicate that the presence of ceria had a significant effect on targeted deposition and stabilization of small metallic gold nanoparticles on the support.

     "abstract": "The direct asymmetric aldol reaction of aromatic aldehydes with acetone catalyzed by L-proline was accelerated by the addition of diols or diphenols. The use of additives decrease the amount of L-proline needed and allowed the use of solvent free conditions. Catechol with two adjacent hydroxy groups on aromatic ring was the most efficient additive. Under the optimized conditions, 5 mol% L-proline with 1 mol% catechol gave excellent chiral selectivity (80% ee value) with > 90% yield, which was higher than that obtained using 30 mol% L-proline without an additive. Computations indicated that the additive promoted the reaction by an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group and the oxygen of the carbonyl group, which activated the carbonyl group of the aldehyde. Catechol with two adjacent hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring can form two hydrogen bonds with the oxygen of the carbonyl group on the corresponding aldehyde.

     "abstract": "The effect of the addition of an alkaline-earth metal oxide (MgO, CaO, SrO or BaO) to a Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst for the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from glycerol and aniline was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption, and thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis. MgO reinforced the interaction between copper and the support, which promoted the dispersion of Cu particles. In addition, MgO increased the amount of weak acid sites and inhibited the formation of coke. As a result, the addition of MgO to Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 gave a much improved catalyst. Adding CaO, SrO or BaO to Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 deteriorated the catalysts because the dispersion of Cu particles became worse and the amounts of weak acid sites on Cu-SrO/SiO2-Al2O3 and Cu-BaO/SiO2-Al2O3 were fewer.

     "abstract": "Mesoporous tungsten trioxide (m-WO3) was prepared using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method and was used as the support of Pt for hydrogenolysis of glycerol to produce 1,3-propanediol. In comparison with commercial WO3, the m-WO3 presents a much larger surface area and better reducibility, which make the Pt particles highly dispersed on the support. At a reaction condition of 180\u00b0C, 5.5 MPa H2, and reaction time of 12 h, the Pt/m-WO3 catalyst afforded 18.0% conversion of glycerol and 39.2% selectivity for 1,3-propanediol, both of which are much higher than those on commercial Pt/WO3 catalyst.\u4ee5\u91d1\u5c5e\u915e\u83c1\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u20052,5-\u4e8c\u7fa7\u9178-3,4-\u4e8c\u70f7\u6c27\u57fa\u567b\u5429\u5728\u6c34\u76f8\u4e2d\u8131\u7fa7,\u2005\u4ee5\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u4ea7\u7387\u548c\u7eaf\u5ea6\u5236\u5f97\u20053,4-\u4e8c\u70f7\u6c27\u57fa\u567b\u5429,\u2005\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6709\u673a\u6781\u6027\u6eb6\u5242\u7684\u4f7f\u7528,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u20058\u2005\u6b21\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u53e6\u5916,\u2005\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u6613\u7684\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u84b8\u998f\u6cd5\u5373\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u4ea7\u7269. \u8be5\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u73af\u5883\u53cb\u597d\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b80\u6613\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\u7b49\u4f18\u70b9,\u2005\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5236\u5907\u20053,4-\u4e8c\u70f7\u6c27\u57fa\u567b\u5429\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u65b9\u6cd5.",

     "abstract": "3,4-Dialkoxythiophenes are electron rich and their polymers have a narrow energy gap, so they have recently attracted considerable attention in the field of organic semiconducting materials. However, the traditional synthetic approach suffers from some drawbacks, so the development of efficient methods for the synthesis of 3,4-dialkoxythiophenes is needed. A novel, efficient decarboxylation of 2,5-dicarboxy-3,4-dialkoxythiophenes were achieved in excellent yields (up to 95%) and purities using metal phthalocyanines in water, which avoids the use of organic polar solvents, and the recovered catalyst was successfully used in subsequent reactions. Furthermore, the desired products, 3,4-dialkoxythiophenes, were conveniently separated by steam distillation. This method has several advantages such as environmental friendliness, ease of manipulation, and a short reaction time. This environmentally friendly procedure represents a promising green route for the decarboxylation of these important compounds.\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u3001\u5171\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u3001\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u548c\u78b3\u5fae\u7403\u786c\u6a21\u677f\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Ni/ZnO\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u6c22\u6ef4\u5b9a\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e2d\u65e0\u5916\u52a0\u6c22\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e19\u4e09\u9187\u91cd\u6574-\u6c22\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u7a7a\u901f\u4e0b,\u2005\u751f\u6210\u7684\u20051,2-\u4e19\u4e8c\u9187\u2005(1,2-PDO)\u2005\u6613\u5728\u2005Ni\u2005\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u88c2\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e59\u9187\u548c\u6c14\u76f8\u4ea7\u7269; \u800c\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u7a7a\u901f\u4e0b,\u2005\u5176\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ea7\u7269\u4e19\u916e\u9187\u7684\u52a0\u6c22. \u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u901f\u4e0b,\u2005Ni\u2005\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\u8d8a\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u20051,2-PDO\u2005\u7684\u751f\u6210. \u5728\u2005Ni\u2005\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u2005Ni/ZnO\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a,\u2005\u5f53\u4e19\u4e09\u9187\u8d28\u91cf\u7a7a\u901f\u4e3a\u20050.84\u2005h\u20131\u2005\u65f6,\u20051,2-PDO\u2005\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6700\u9ad8,\u2005\u4e3a\u200554.9%,\u2005\u4e19\u4e09\u9187\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u4e3a\u200585.4%.",

     "abstract": "The catalytic conversion of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) is generally conducted batch-wise in an autoclave in the presence of high pressure H2. The reforming and hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO over Ni/ZnO catalysts in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor without added H2 was reported. The Ni/ZnO catalysts were prepared by wetness impregnation (WI), co-precipitation (CP), hydrothermal treatment (HT), and carbon microsphere hard-templating (CT) methods. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and H2 titration. At a low weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of glycerol, the 1,2-PDO produced got degraded to ethanol and gas phase products over catalysts with high Ni dispersion, while at a high WHSV, the selectivity for 1,2-PDO was limited by the hydrogenation of the acetol intermediate. At the optimized WHSV, the catalyst with a higher Ni dispersion was more selective for 1,2-PDO, and over the Ni/ZnO catalyst with the highest Ni dispersion, the highest selectivity of 54.9% for 1,2-PDO was obtained at a glycerol conversion of 85.4% at the WHSV of 0.84 h\u22121.\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u3001\u5171\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u3001\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u548c\u78b3\u5fae\u7403\u786c\u6a21\u677f\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Ni/ZnO\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u6c22\u6ef4\u5b9a\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e2d\u65e0\u5916\u52a0\u6c22\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e19\u4e09\u9187\u91cd\u6574-\u6c22\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u7a7a\u901f\u4e0b,\u2005\u751f\u6210\u7684\u20051,2-\u4e19\u4e8c\u9187\u2005(1,2-PDO)\u2005\u6613\u5728\u2005Ni\u2005\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u88c2\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e59\u9187\u548c\u6c14\u76f8\u4ea7\u7269; \u800c\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u7a7a\u901f\u4e0b,\u2005\u5176\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ea7\u7269\u4e19\u916e\u9187\u7684\u52a0\u6c22. \u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u901f\u4e0b,\u2005Ni\u2005\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\u8d8a\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u20051,2-PDO\u2005\u7684\u751f\u6210. \u5728\u2005Ni\u2005\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u2005Ni/ZnO\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a,\u2005\u5f53\u4e19\u4e09\u9187\u8d28\u91cf\u7a7a\u901f\u4e3a\u20050.84\u2005h\u20131\u2005\u65f6,\u20051,2-PDO\u2005\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6700\u9ad8,\u2005\u4e3a\u200554.9%,\u2005\u4e19\u4e09\u9187\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u4e3a\u200585.4%.",

The structure and composition of the nanocomposites were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, BET surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. The average size of the TiO2 nanoparticles on the graphene nanosheets was controlled at around 10\u201315 nm without using surfactant, which is attributed to the pyrolysis and condensation of dissolved TNB into TiO2 by ultrasonic irradiation. The catalytic activity of the composites under ultrasonic irradiation was determined using a rhodamine B (RhB) solution. The graphene-TiO2 composites possessed a high specific surface area, which increased the decolorization rate for RhB solution. This is because the graphene and TiO2 nanoparticles in the composites interact strongly, which enhances the photoelectric conversion of TiO2 by reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.",

The Co-Mn-Al layered double hydroxides were prepared by coprecipitation. Nitrobenzene was used as a model compound, and it was shown that the degradation and mineralization of nitrobenzene was increased by the presence of Co-Mn-Al layered double hydroxides as compared to ozonation alone. Both an indirect method of adding a scavenger (tert-butanol) of the hydroxyl radical chain reaction and direct electron spin resonance using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide as a spin trapping agent were used to investigate the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the ozonation by the Co-Mn-Al layered double hydroxides. The inhibiting effect of tert-butanol on the degradation of nitrobenzene and the detection of the stronger 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide/hydroxyl radical adduct showed that the Co-Mn-Al layered double hydroxides catalyzed the generation of hydroxyl radicals.\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Co-Mn-Al\u2005\u5c42\u72b6\u53cc\u6c22\u6c27\u5316\u7269,\u2005\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee5\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u81ed\u6c27\u964d\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005Co-Mn-Al\u2005\u5c42\u72b6\u53cc\u6c22\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u5b58\u5728\u65f6,\u2005\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u7684\u964d\u89e3\u548c\u77ff\u5316\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u5355\u72ec\u81ed\u6c27\u6c27\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8. \u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u5165\u7f9f\u57fa\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u6355\u83b7\u5242\u2005(\u53d4\u4e01\u9187)\u2005\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u987a\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u68c0\u6d4b\u2005(5,5-\u4e8c\u7532\u57fa-1-\u5421\u54af\u5549-N-\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u4e3a\u6355\u83b7\u5242)\u2005\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5,\u2005\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u2005Co-Mn-Al\u2005\u5c42\u72b6\u53cc\u6c22\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u662f\u5426\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u7f9f\u57fa\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u7684\u751f\u6210. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u52a0\u5165\u53d4\u4e01\u9187\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u7684\u964d\u89e3\u6548\u7387; \u7535\u5b50\u987a\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u68c0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7f9f\u57fa\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u52a0\u6210\u7269\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u53f7.

     "abstract": "Zeolite crystals were synthesized at a lower temperature (150\u00b0C) by adding a nucleation solution prepared at higher temperature (190\u00b0C) to the mother solution. The effects of the Na2O/SiO2 ratio, nucleation time of the nucleation solution, and the ratio of Na2O/SiO2 ratio in the mother solution on crystal transformation between ZSM-5 and mordenite were investigated. The transformation between zeolite ZSM-5 and mordenite could be controlled effectively by changing the overall Na2O/SiO2 ratio in the overall solution. A Na2O/SiO2 ratio of 0.18 formed a boundary between ZSM-5 and mordenite phases when the overall solution had a composition of xNa2O:100SiO2:2.5Al2O3:12SO42\u2212:4000H2O. When the Na2O/SiO2 ratio was increased higher than 0.18 by altering the composition of the mother solution, the ZSM-5 product formed by nucleation at higher temperature (190\u00b0C) could be transformed into mordenite crystals during crystallization at lower temperature (150\u00b0C). When the Na2O/SiO2 ratio was \u2264 0.18, a product containing both ZSM-5 and mordenite crystals was obtained during nucleation at higher temperature that could be transformed into ZSM-5 crystals during crystallization at lower temperature. A precondition for crystal transformation between ZSM-5 and mordenite was that the crystallinity of the product formed during nucleation at higher temperature must be \u2264 30%.\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u6676\u5316\u6db2\u6dfb\u52a0\u6cd5,\u2005\u5373\u5c06\u9ad8\u6e29\u2005(190\u2005\u00b0C)\u2005\u9884\u6676\u5316\u6db2\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u4f4e\u6e29\u2005(150\u2005\u00b0C)\u2005\u6676\u5316\u6bcd\u6db2\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u6cb8\u77f3\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u9ad8\u6e29\u9884\u6676\u5316\u6db2\u7684\u2005Na2O:SiO2\u2005\u6bd4\u3001\u9884\u6676\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u6e29\u6676\u5316\u6bcd\u6db2\u7684\u2005Na2O:SiO2\u2005\u6bd4\u5bf9\u2005ZSM-5\u2005\u4e0e\u4e1d\u5149\u6cb8\u77f3\u4e4b\u95f4\u8f6c\u6676\u7684\u5f71\u54cd,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u548c\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u6574\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6db2\u7684\u2005Na2O:SiO2\u2005\u6bd4\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u2005ZSM-5\u2005\u6cb8\u77f3\u4e0e\u4e1d\u5149\u6cb8\u77f3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6676. \u5f53\u6574\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6db2\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u4e3a\u2005xNa2O:100SiO2:2.5Al2O3:12SO42-:4000H2O\u2005\u65f6,\u2005Na2O:SiO2\u2005=\u20050.18\u2005\u662f\u2005ZSM-5\u2005\u6cb8\u77f3\u548c\u4e1d\u5149\u6cb8\u77f3\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u754c\u7ebf. \u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u6bcd\u6db2\u7684\u2005Na\u2005\u542b\u91cf,\u2005\u4f7f\u2005Na2O:SiO2\u2005>\u20050.18\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u9ad8\u6e29\u9884\u6676\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u2005MFI\u2005\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u6676\u5316\u65f6\u53ef\u5411\u4e1d\u5149\u6cb8\u77f3\u53d1\u751f\u8f6c\u6676; \u5f53\u2005Na2O:SiO2\u2005\u2264\u20050.18\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u5177\u6709\u2005MFI\u2005\u548c\u4e1d\u5149\u6cb8\u77f3\u7ed3\u6784\u5171\u751f\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u6676\u5316\u65f6\u5411\u2005MFI\u2005\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u2005ZSM-5\u2005\u6cb8\u77f3\u53d1\u751f\u8f6c\u6676.

The nickel is present in elemental state as fcc phase on the catalyst as evidenced by X-ray diffraction results. The Ni crystallite size was found to be greater for Ni/anatase. The temperature-programmed reduction results suggest a greater metal-support interaction for Ni/rutile. The observed order of catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene is Ni/rutile > Ni/anatase > Ni/TiO2. A conversion of 99% was observed for Ni/rutile at 140\u00b0C and hydrogen pressure of 1.96 MPa. Interestingly, aniline is the only product formed which demonstrates the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene proceeds with atom economy. Both Ni/rutile and Ni/anatase exhibited a better stability than Ni/TiO2. The hydrogenation proceeds with the preferential adsorption of hydrogen on nickel present in the catalyst surface, possibly assisted by TiOx species.",

     "abstract": "A modified hydrothermal process method based on using urea instead of water as the solvent was used to prepare CeOHCO3. Pure CeOHCO3 with a single crystalline structure was produced by varying the experimental conditions. CeO2 particles obtained from these CeOHCO3 precursors were tested for CH4 oxidation. The temperatures for 90% methane conversion were 604 and 647\u00b0C for CeO2 catalysts obtained from hexagonal and orthorhombic CeOHCO3, respectively, indicating that the CeO2 catalyst from hexagonal CeOHCO3 (CeO2-A) was more active than that from the orthorhombic form (CeO2-D). The specific surface area and pore volume of CeO2-A were 45 m2/g and 0.35 cm3/g, respectively, which were higher than those of CeO2-D. H2-TPR showed a much lower reduction temperature and enhanced reducibility with CeO2-A. XPS and O2-TPD results demonstrated there were more oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2-A than on CeO2-D, which implied increased oxygen mobility. The CeOHCO3-structure dependent activity was investigated and found to originate from the morphologies of the CeOHCO3 precursors. Hexagonal CeOHCO3 had a rod-like shape while orthorhombic CeOHCO3 had a sphere-like morphology. After calcination, the obtained CeO2 had the morphology of the precursor. The difference in morphology gave CeO2 catalysts with different texture, structure, reducibility, and thus catalytic activity.\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u65e0\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u8f85\u52a9\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u5728\u20052\u2005min\u2005\u5185\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u82b1\u72b6\u2005Co3O4. \u6240\u7528\u539f\u6599\u5747\u662f\u65e0\u673a\u76d0. \u524d\u9a71\u4f53\u6d53\u5ea6\u548c\u5c3f\u7d20\u7684\u9010\u6e10\u6c34\u89e3\u5bf9\u2005Co3O4\u2005\u5f62\u8c8c\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5927. \u5236\u5f97\u7684\u82b1\u72b6\u2005Co3O4\u2005\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5927,\u2005\u4e14\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u2005(110)\u2005\u9ad8\u6d3b\u6027\u6307\u6570\u9762,\u2005\u5bf9\u2005CO\u2005\u6c27\u5316\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027.",

Pt was highly dispersed on these different sized carbon supports with an average particle size between 2.8\u20135.0 nm. Glycerol oxidation was catalyzed by these highly dispersed Pt catalysts in a base-free aqueous solution. The activity of the Pt catalysts increased with decreasing particle size of the carbon support, which was attributed to the higher accessibility of reactants to the Pt nanoparticles.

The lead oxide catalyst exhibited an excellent stability, which could be reused five times without a significant loss in catalytic activity. X-Ray powder diffraction analysis showed that the recovered catalyst was a mixture of cubic metal Pb and orthorhombic PbO2, with the latter shown to be the real active component for the synthesis of DEC. Verification experiments showed that the reaction between DEC and PbO was the main reason for the reduction of PbO to metal Pb.\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6c27\u5316\u94c5\u5728\u6c28\u57fa\u7532\u9178\u4e59\u916f\u2005(EC)\u2005\u4e0e\u4e59\u9187\u53cd\u5e94\u5408\u6210\u78b3\u9178\u4e8c\u4e59\u916f\u2005(DEC)\u2005\u4e2d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u4f5c\u7528. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u6c27\u5316\u94c5\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027,\u2005\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u20055\u2005\u6b21,\u2005\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d. \u56de\u6536\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e3a\u7acb\u65b9\u6676\u76f8\u91d1\u5c5e\u2005Pb\u2005\u548c\u659c\u65b9\u6676\u76f8\u2005PbO2\u2005\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7269,\u2005\u7ed3\u5408\u53cd\u5e94\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u8ba4\u4e3a,\u2005\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u7ec4\u5206. \u7ed3\u679c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005PbO\u2005\u4e0e\u2005DEC\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u662f\u2005PbO\u2005\u88ab\u8fd8\u539f\u4e3a\u2005Pb\u2005\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0.",

     "abstract": "Titanium oxide acetylacetonate (TiO(acac)2) was found to be a novel and efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of phenol and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to diphenyl carbonate (DPC). The conversion of phenol was 45.8% on the TiO(acac)2 pretreated at 180 \u00b0C, and the turnover number reached 96, which was better than the more common organic titanium catalyst. The effect of the amount of catalyst on the catalytic performance was investigated. The transesterification selectivity decreased with catalyst loadings over 0.2 g per 100 ml reactants. At the optimized amount of catalyst the conversion of phenol was 42.4%, and no anisole was detected. In particular, the TiO(acac)2 catalyst proved reusable, and catalytic activity of the recovered TiO(acac)2 was almost the same as that of the fresh catalyst. The conversion of phenol 40.0% was attained from TiO(acac)2 recovered for the fifth time.\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u4e59\u9170\u4e19\u916e\u6c27\u949b\u7528\u4e8e\u82ef\u915a\u548c\u78b3\u9178\u4e8c\u7532\u916f\u7684\u916f\u4ea4\u6362\u53cd\u5e94\u5408\u6210\u78b3\u9178\u4e8c\u82ef\u916f,\u2005\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u916f\u4ea4\u6362\u9009\u62e9\u6027,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7ecf\u2005180\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u540e,\u2005\u82ef\u915a\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe\u200545.8%,\u2005\u8f6c\u5316\u6570\u2005(n(\u82ef\u915a)/n(Ti))\u2005\u4e3a\u200596,\u2005\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6709\u673a\u949b\u7c7b\u5747\u76f8\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5f53\u4e59\u9170\u4e19\u916e\u6c27\u949b\u7528\u91cf\u4e3a\u20050.2\u2005g\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0a,\u2005\u5f00\u59cb\u6709\u526f\u4ea7\u7269\u82ef\u7532\u919a\u751f\u6210,\u2005\u916f\u4ea4\u6362\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u968f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7528\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u964d\u4f4e. \u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u20055\u2005\u6b21\u540e,\u2005\u82ef\u915a\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u4ecd\u53ef\u8fbe\u200540%\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0a,\u2005\u916f\u4ea4\u6362\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e3a\u200599.9%,\u2005\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u6027\u80fd.",

It was found that Cu30Cr5/alumina B exhibited better catalytic performance than Cu30Cr5/\u03b3-Al2O3. 99.0% conversion of TAA and 97.2% selectivity for TMP were obtained over Cu30Cr5/alumina B under optimized conditions. Cu30Cr5/\u03b3-Al2O3 and Cu30Cr5/alumina B were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption.

     "abstract": "A Ru-Zn catalyst was prepared by co-precipitation, and the effect of adding diethanolamine on benzene selective hydrogenation to cyclohexene was investigated. The catalyst was characterized by N2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. Diethanolamine reacted with ZnSO4 in the slurry to form (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 and diethanolamine sulfate. The amount of (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 adsorbed on the catalyst surface increased with increasing diethanolamine amount. The synergism of (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 and diethanolamine sulfate improved the cyclohexene selectivity of the Ru-Zn(4.9%) catalyst. With a diethanolamine dosage of 0.3 g, (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 was highly dispersed on catalyst surface and the sample after hydrogenation was characterized. This catalyst exhibited the best performance with a cyclohexene selectivity and yield of 75.5% and 63.6%, respectively, at the benzene conversion of 84.3% in the third run. Moreover, the benzene conversion and cyclohexene selectivity were stable above 75% and cyclohexene yield was above 58% in the fourth run.\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Ru-Zn\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e8c\u4e59\u9187\u80fa\u7684\u6dfb\u52a0\u5bf9\u2005Ru-Zn\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u82ef\u9009\u62e9\u52a0\u6c22\u5236\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u2005N2\u2005\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u8367\u5149\u3001\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7ea2\u5916\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u4e8c\u4e59\u9187\u80fa\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u6d46\u6db2\u4e2d\u2005ZnSO4\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u2005(Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3\u2005\u548c\u786b\u9178\u4e8c\u4e59\u9187\u80fa\u76d0. \u968f\u7740\u4e8c\u4e59\u9187\u80fa\u7528\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u5316\u5b66\u5438\u9644\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u7684\u2005(Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3\u2005\u589e\u591a,\u2005\u5b83\u4e0e\u786b\u9178\u4e8c\u4e59\u9187\u80fa\u76d0\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u2005Ru-Zn(4.9%)\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u82ef\u9009\u62e9\u52a0\u6c22\u751f\u6210\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027. \u5f53\u4e8c\u4e59\u9187\u80fa\u7528\u91cf\u4e3a\u20050.3\u2005g\u2005\u65f6,\u2005(Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3\u2005\u5728\u2005Ru-Zn(4.9%)\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u52a0\u6c22\u540e\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u8868\u9762\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u6563,\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73,\u2005\u5faa\u73af\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u20053\u2005\u6b21\u65f6\u82ef\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u4e3a\u200584.3%,\u2005\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u6536\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u200575.5%\u2005\u548c\u200563.6%; \u4f7f\u7528\u81f3\u7b2c\u20054\u2005\u6b21\u65f6,\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u200525\u2005min\u2005\u65f6\u82ef\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u548c\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4ecd\u53ef\u8fbe\u200575%\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0a,\u2005\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u6536\u7387\u4e3a\u200558%\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0a.",

     "abstract": "Highly loaded Co/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by the co-precipitation method with resorcinol formaldehyde resin gel (RFG). Most RFG was decomposed during the drying process at 393 K, and little carbon was remained in the catalysts. However, the presence of RFG during the precipitation played the important roles in increasing the pore sizes of catalysts and the reducibility and dispersion of supported cobalt, leading to the more surface active cobalt sites and large pores of the catalysts and therefore the higher activity for the Fischer-Tropsch reactions to produce heavy hydrocarbons.

     "abstract": "Anatase TiO2 nanosheets with dominant (001) facets were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. Nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanosheets (TiO2-N) with different nitrogen concentration were successfully synthesized by annealing TiO2 nanosheets in NH3 atmosphere with different NH3 flow rate at 400 \u00b0C for 3 h. The morphology, nanostructures, and properties of TiO2-N were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and photoluminescence. The effects of NH3 flow rate on the nanostructures, properties, and visible-light photoactivity in the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) aqueous solution under visible light (\u03bb> 400 nm) irradiation of the prepared photocatalysts were investigated. Among all the prepared photocatalysts including nitrogen modified P25 (Degussa), TiO2-N prepared with a NH3 flow rate of 40 ml/min gave the highest visible-light photoactivity because of the dominant (001) facets, visible light responsibility, the slowest photogenerated electron (e\u2212) and hole (h+) pairs recombination rate, and the highest hydroxyl radicle (\u00b7OH) generation ability. Based on these experiments and analysis, the mechanisms of how the nitrogen concentration affects the visible-light photoactivity of TiO2-N were proposed.\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u5bcc\u542b\u2005(001)\u2005\u6676\u9762\u7684\u9510\u949b\u77ff\u578b\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u7247,\u2005\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u2005NH3\u2005\u6d41\u901f\u5236\u5907\u4e0d\u540c\u2005N\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u7247. \u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u573a\u53d1\u5c04\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3001\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u548c\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u4ee5\u7f57\u4e39\u660e\u2005B\u2005\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u964d\u89e3\u7269,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u2005N\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u6d53\u5ea6\u5bf9\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u7247\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005NH3\u2005\u6d41\u901f\u4e3a\u200540\u2005ml/min\u2005\u65f6\u5236\u5907\u7684\u2005N\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u7247\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u5149\u751f\u7535\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u590d\u5408\u901f\u7387,\u2005\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u2022OH\u2005\u4ea7\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u540c\u65f6,\u2005\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u2005N\u2005\u63ba\u6742\u6d53\u5ea6\u5bf9\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u7247\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u673a\u7406.",

Both the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts gave good catalytic activities at atmospheric pressure. The CeO2 impregnated Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited excellent stability at 800 \u00b0C for 100 h on stream, and after the reaction, carbon deposits were not formed on the catalyst. The Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts had a regular hexagonal mesoporous structure. The nickel species and the Ce-Mo oxide components were all in the SBA-15 mesopores.

The target nanocomposites were formed by growing polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers on the magnetic polymer supports with carboxylic groups and then silver nanoparticles were embedded into the PAMAM dendrimer shell. In this way recoverable Fe3O4@PS@PAMAM-Ag nanocomposites were successfully prepared. The magnetic nanocatalysts were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that the PAMAM dendrimer shell immobilized on the magnetic supports was beneficial for dispersion and stabilization of the silver nanoparticles. The silver content of the Fe3O4@PS@PAMAM(G7)-Ag nanoparticles was 1.64 wt%. The catalytic activity of the Fe3O4@PS@PAMAM-Ag nanocomposites was proved using the reduction of 4-nitrophenol as a model catalytic reaction. The nanocomposites could be readily separated by magnetic separation and reused for the next reduction with high efficiency.

     "abstract": "Crystalline AlPO-5, SAPO-5, and metal substituted AlPO-5 (MeAlPOs) were prepared by the hydrothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy, particle size distribution, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), H2 temperature-programmed reduction, and thermogravimetric-differential thermogravimetric (TG-DTG) analysis. All the samples crystallized with the AFI structure. TPD profiles showed that stronger Br\u00f8nsted acid sites appeared and the number of Lewis acid sites increased when Si or a metal was introduced into the framework of AlPO-5. ICP, FT-IR spectra, and TG-DTG curves confirmed that Si or the metals were incorporated into the framework of the AlPO-5. The catalytic properties of the samples in cyclohexane nitrosation to e-caprolactam were studied. SAPO-5 with a larger BET surface area, more Lewis acid sites, and stronger Br\u00f8nsted acid sites gave better activity and selectivity than AlPO-5. Among the MeAlPOs, CrAPO-5 with the larger BET surface area, more Lewis acid sites, and stronger Br\u00f8nsted acid sites gave the better result with a conversion of 8.16% and e-caprolactam selectivity of 68.17%.\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ed3\u6676\u6001\u7684\u2005AlPO-5\u2005(\u78f7\u9178\u94dd\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b),\u2005SAPO-5\u2005(\u7845\u78f7\u9178\u94dd\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b)\u2005\u548c\u2005MeAlPOs\u2005(\u91d1\u5c5e\u53d6\u4ee3\u578b\u78f7\u9178\u94dd\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b)\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u2005\u5438\u9644\u8131\u9644\u6cd5\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u7535\u611f\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u3001NH3\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u3001H2\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u548c\u70ed\u91cd-\u5fae\u5206\u70ed\u91cd\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u73af\u5df1\u70f7\u4e9a\u785d\u5316\u4e00\u6b65\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u5df1\u5185\u9170\u80fa\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u968f\u7740\u2005Si\u2005\u6216\u91d1\u5c5e\u539f\u5b50\u5f15\u5165\u2005AlPO-5\u2005\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u2005Lewis\u2005\u5f31\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u540c\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u2005Br\u00f8nsted\u2005\u5f3a\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3. \u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u2005AlPO-5,\u2005\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u8f83\u591a\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u2005SAPO-5\u2005\u548c\u2005CrAPO-5\u2005\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u73af\u5df1\u70f7\u4e9a\u785d\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u540e\u8005\u73af\u5df1\u70f7\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u4e3a\u20058.16%,\u2005\u5df1\u5185\u9170\u80fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fbe\u200568.17%.",

More than 20 reactions involving CO2 as a starting material have been developed in recent decades but their successful industrialization is limited. One type of reactions that is technologically viable is to use CO2 as a carboxylative reagent in the production of a wide range of carboxylic acids and derivatives. This review focused on transition metal-catalyzed reactions for the synthesis of various carboxylic acid and derivatives from CO2, by the carboxylation of carbon nucleophiles and C-H bonds and reactions of CO2 with unsaturated organic compounds (especially those with a carbon-carbon multiple bond). This review also included transition metal-free or organocatalytic reactions for the transformation of CO2 into carboxylic acid and derivatives.\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u662f\u50a8\u91cf\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u5ec9\u4ef7\u6613\u5f97\u4e14\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u7684\u2005C1\u2005\u8d44\u6e90,\u2005\u5c06\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u8f6c\u5316\u6210\u9ad8\u9644\u52a0\u503c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u4eba\u4eec\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8. \u76ee\u524d,\u2005\u867d\u7136\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u7528\u4f5c\u521d\u59cb\u539f\u6599\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5df2\u7ecf\u5de5\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u5f88\u5c11,\u2005\u4f46\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u4e8c\u5341\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u7684\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u65b0\u53cd\u5e94\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u5176\u4e2d\u4ee5\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7fa7\u5316\u8bd5\u5242\u5408\u6210\u5404\u79cd\u7fa7\u9178\u53ca\u5176\u884d\u751f\u7269\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u4ee3\u8868. \u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u50ac\u5316\u5408\u6210\u7fa7\u9178\u53ca\u5176\u884d\u751f\u7269\u7684\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u78b3\u4eb2\u6838\u8bd5\u5242\u3001\u78b3\u6c22\u952e\u4ee5\u53ca\u78b3\u78b3\u591a\u91cd\u952e\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u65e0\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u53c2\u4e0e\u6216\u6709\u673a\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u50ac\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5c06\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u8f6c\u5316\u6210\u7fa7\u9178\u53ca\u5176\u884d\u751f\u7269\u7684\u53cd\u5e94.",

The nanocomposite photocatalyst could inhibit the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs of TiO2 and then enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency. The results presented by transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, Raman microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that anatase TiO2 particles attached on the surface of the film-shaped graphene. The photocatalytic capability of graphene-TiO2 catalyst under UV light was evaluated and the results showed that graphene-TiO2 had good stability and better photocatalytic ability than pure TiO2 prepared by similar method.

NO2, HCHO, CH3NO, and CH3NO2 were the reactive intermediates generated by the plasma. The further reactions of these intermediates on the catalyst during the thermal catalytic stage resulted in the conversion of NOx to N2, which was verified by temperature-programmed surface reaction characterization. B2O3\u03b3-Al2O3 was the best catalyst with the maximum conversion of NOx to N2 increasing from 33.4% on \u03b3-Al2O3 to 51.0% on 10 wt% B2O3\u03b3-Al2O3 at 300 \u00b0C. NH3-TPD characterization showed that the acidity of the catalyst is important for the reduction of NOx by the intermediates generated by the plasma.

     "abstract": "Ni2P/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts were prepared for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol, and their structural properties were characterized by N2 sorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, CO chemisorption, H2 temperature-programmed desorption, and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption. It was found that Ni2P/SiO2 had a similar density of exposed Ni sites as Ni/SiO2, while Ni2P/SiO2 had much larger amount of acid sites and surface hydrogen species than Ni/SiO2. Ni2P/SiO2 was more active than Ni/SiO2 in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. This is attributed to the synergism between acid and metal sites on Ni2P/SiO2. Glycerol was mainly converted to 1,2-propanediol over Ni2P/SiO2, while it was mostly converted to not only 1,2-propanediol but also ethylene glycol and ethanol over Ni/SiO2. The formation of ethylene glycol and ethanol on Ni/SiO2 is attributed to the C\u2013C bond cleavage catalyzed by metallic Ni rather than weak acidity. In addition, temperature and H2 pressure increase did not promote the formation of ethylene glycol and ethanol on Ni2P/SiO2. Instead they mainly promoted the further conversion of 1,2-propanediol to form 1-propanol. Thus, Ni2P/SiO2 was more active for the cleavage of C\u2013O bonds and less active for the cleavage of C\u2013C bonds than Ni/SiO2. We suggest that the higher activity of Ni2P/SiO2 for the cleavage of C\u2013O bonds can be ascribed to its acidity, while its lower activity for the cleavage of C\u2013C bonds may be mainly related to its electronic and geometrical properties.\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u53ca\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Ni2P/SiO2\u2005\u548c\u2005Ni/SiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u2005N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u8367\u5149\u3001CO\u2005\u5316\u5b66\u5438\u9644\u3001\u6c22\u6c14\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u53ca\u6c28\u6c14\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u7518\u6cb9\u6c22\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005Ni2P/SiO2\u2005\u548c\u2005Ni/SiO2\u2005\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u8868\u9762\u2005Ni\u2005\u5bc6\u5ea6,\u2005\u4f46\u524d\u8005\u8868\u9762\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6c22\u7269\u79cd\u2005(\u5305\u62ec\u5438\u9644\u6c22\u548c\u6ea2\u6d41\u6c22)\u2005\u5bc6\u5ea6\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u9ad8,\u2005\u4e14\u5728\u7518\u6cb9\u6c22\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u4e5f\u66f4\u9ad8,\u2005\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5176\u9178\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u5173.

Partial substitution of Ni by Cu showed higher activities and selectivities towards syngas products. LaNi0.8Cu0.2O3 was the most active toward the CH4 and CO2 conversions, and was selective for syngas products. Temperature-programmed reduction results showed that the addition of Cu facilitates the reduction of Ni3+ to Ni0, which is the main reason for the higher performance of this catalyst.",

The composite samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activities for the Cu2S/T-ZnOw nanocomposites increased with Cu/Zn molar ratio up to 4%, and then decreased with further increase of the Cu/Zn molar ratio up to 10%. The Cu2S/T-ZnOw nanocomposites exhibited higher activity than T-ZnOw for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange. Recycling experiments were also performed. The photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst showed no decrease after three cycles, which demonstrated that the Cu2S/T-ZnOw photocatalyst had excellent stability.\u5728\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u5421\u54af\u70f7\u916e\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5143\u9187\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u94dc/\u950c\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u7684\u786b\u5316\u4e9a\u94dc/\u56db\u9488\u72b6\u6c27\u5316\u950c\u6676\u987b\u7eb3\u7c73\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599,\u2005\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u573a\u53d1\u5c04\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u548c\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b,\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u5bf9\u7532\u57fa\u6a59\u7684\u5149\u964d\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u2005ZnO\u2005\u6676\u987b. \u5728\u94dc/\u950c\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u4f4e\u4e8e\u20054%\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u94dc/\u950c\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u94dc/\u950c\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u7684\u7ee7\u7eed\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d. \u6b64\u5916,\u2005\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u5468\u671f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u8bc4\u4ef7\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027.",

     "abstract": "A series of zirconia catalysts supported on Si-MCM-41 and Al-doped MCM-41 (Si/Al = 50) mesoporous molecular sieves, silica, \u03b3Al2O3, and MgO were prepared by the wet impregnation method. The catalytic activities of these materials in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction (MPV) of benzaldehyde with 2-propanol as reducing agent were investigated, and compared to that of hydrous zirconia. The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared and thermal desorption of pyridine. Loading zirconia on Si-MCM-41, Al-MCM-41, and SiO2 gave improved catalytic activity. This is attributed to a strong interaction of zirconia with the support to form Si\u2013O\u2013Zr bonds, which gave a significant increase in the amount of exposed Zr\u2013OH groups and stronger Lewis acidity as well as an appearance of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites. The activity of 5%ZrO2/Si-MCM-41 was the highest, followed by those of 5%ZrO2/Al-MCM-41 and 5%ZrO2/SiO2. However, 5%ZrO2/Al2O3 and 5%ZrO2/MgO gave very low catalytic activities. This is ascribed to that the acidities of 5%ZrO2/Al2O3 and the \u03b3 Al2O3 support were similar due to the weak interaction of zirconia with \u03b3Al2O3, and 5%ZrO2/MgO had no acidity because of the strong interaction between zirconia and MgO.\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Si-MCM-41\u2005\u548c\u2005Al-MCM-41\u2005(Si/Al\u2005=\u200550)\u2005\u4ecb\u5b54\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b,\u2005SiO2,\u2005\u03b3-Al2O3\u2005\u53ca\u2005MgO\u2005\u7b49\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u2005ZrO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4ee5\u5f02\u4e19\u9187\u4e3a\u6c22\u6e90\u82ef\u7532\u919b\u2005Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley\u2005(MPV)\u2005\u8fd8\u539f\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u5e76\u4e0e\u7eaf\u2005ZrO2\u2005\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4. \u540c\u65f6,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u2005\u5438\u8131\u9644\u6cd5\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u3001\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u5421\u5576\u539f\u4f4d\u5438\u9644\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005ZrO2\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e8e\u2005Si-MCM-41,\u2005Al-MCM-41\u2005\u548c\u2005SiO2\u2005\u540e,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u9ad8,\u2005\u8fd9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u2005ZrO2\u2005\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f62\u6210\u2005Zr\u2212O\u2212Si\u2005\u952e,\u2005\u4f7f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u2005Zr\u2212OH\u2005\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u589e\u591a,\u2005Lewis\u2005\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a,\u2005\u5e76\u51fa\u73b0\u2005Br\u00f6nsted\u2005\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3,\u2005\u4e09\u79cd\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u9ad8\u4f4e\u6b21\u5e8f\u662f\u20055%ZrO2/Si-MCM-41\u2005>\u20055%ZrO2/Al-MCM-41\u2005>\u20055%ZrO2/SiO2. \u800c\u20055%ZrO2/Al2O3\u2005\u548c\u20055%ZrO2/MgO\u2005\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u4e3a\u2005ZrO2\u2005\u4e0e\u2005\u03b3-Al2O3\u2005\u7684\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f7f\u20055%ZrO2/Al2O3\u2005\u7684\u9178\u6027\u4e0e\u03b3-Al2O3\u2005\u7c7b\u4f3c,\u2005ZrO2\u2005\u4e0e\u2005MgO\u2005\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f7f\u20055%ZrO2/MgO\u2005\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u9178\u6027.",

     "abstract": "The effect of the dispersion state and surface properties of supported vanadia on the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) activity of NO over V2O5/TiO2 catalysts was studied by various experimental techniques. The experimental monolayer dispersion capacity of V2O5 on anatase (6.86 VOx/nm2) measured by XRD was almost the same as the concentration of surface vacant sites of anatase estimated by the incorporation model, and it was suggested that isolated vanadia species tend to be dispersed on adjacent octahedral vacant sites. An increase of the NO turnover frequency (TOF) at 300 \u00b0C to a maximum (8.3 \u00d7 103 s1) at a coverage near half a monolayer was related to the increase of the amount of weak acid sites (Br\u00f6nsted acid site on each vanadium ion). The TOF decreased rapidly at high VOx coverages because of a decrease of the reducibility of vanadia species and a decrease of the ratio of exposed vanadia species on the surface. The Br\u00f6nsted acid sites on bridging V\u2013O(H)\u2013V and terminal V\u2013OH of polymeric vanadia species were all active sites in the SCR reaction. The SCR activity of the V2O5/TiO2 catalysts was related to the dispersion state, acidity, and reducibility of the vanadia species.\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u624b\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u2005V2O5/TiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u2005VOx\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u8868\u9762\u9178\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u2005(SCR)\u2005NO\u2005\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005V2O5\u2005\u5728\u9510\u949b\u77ff\u2005TiO2\u2005\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u6d4b\u5355\u5c42\u5206\u6563\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3a\u20051.14\u2005mmol\u2005V/100\u2005m2TiO2,\u2005\u4e0e\u201c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u201d\u7684\u4f30\u7b97\u503c\u76f8\u7b26,\u2005\u8868\u660e\u5206\u6563\u6001\u7684\u9492\u79bb\u5b50\u5e94\u952e\u5408\u5728\u2005TiO2\u2005\u8868\u9762\u7684\u516b\u9762\u4f53\u7a7a\u4f4d\u4e0a. \u968f\u7740\u2005V2O5\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0,\u2005V2O5/TiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u2005NO\u2005\u8f6c\u5316\u9891\u7387\u2005(TOF)\u2005\u5148\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u81f3\u20050.70\u2005mmol\u2005V/100\u2005m2\u2005TiO2\u2005(\u7565\u8d85\u8fc7\u5206\u6563\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u534a)\u2005\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u6781\u5927\u2005(\u7ea6\u20058.3\u2005\u00d7\u200510\u22123\u2005s\u22121),\u2005\u7136\u540e\u53c8\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d; \u540c\u65f6,\u2005\u5b64\u7acb\u2005VOx\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5206\u6563\u5728\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u516b\u9762\u4f53\u7a7a\u4f4d\u4e0a,\u2005\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u2005V\u2013O\u2013V\u2005\u5316\u5b66\u952e\u76f8\u8fde\u5f62\u6210\u805a\u5408\u7684\u2005VOx\u2005\u7269\u79cd,\u2005V\u2013O\u2013V\u2005\u952e\u6240\u5360\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u2005V\u2013O\u2013Ti\u2005\u952e\u6240\u5360\u6bd4\u4f8b\u51cf\u5c0f,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u5355\u4f4d\u9492\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u2005Br\u00f6nsted\u2005\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3\u91cf\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u6545\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u2005TOF\u2005\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0. \u968f\u7740\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u867d\u7136\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u5355\u4f4d\u9492\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u2005Br\u00f6nsted\u2005\u9178\u4e2d\u5fc3\u91cf\u4ecd\u7f13\u6162\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u4f46\u2005V\u2013O\u2013Ti\u2005\u952e\u6240\u5360\u6bd4\u4f8b\u51cf\u5c11,\u2005\u5bfc\u81f4\u9492\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u53ef\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u4e0b\u964d,\u2005\u53e6\u5916,\u2005\u5206\u6563\u5bb9\u91cf\u4ee5\u4e0a\u65f6\u6676\u76f8\u2005V2O5\u2005\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4e5f\u5bfc\u81f4\u9492\u79bb\u5b50\u8868\u9762\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0b\u964d,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u2005TOF\u2005\u4e0b\u964d. \u6865\u5f0f\u2005Br\u00f6nsted\u2005\u9178\u4f4d\u2005(V\u2013O(H)\u2005\u2013V)\u2005\u4e5f\u662f\u2005SCR\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e4b\u4e00,\u2005\u4e0d\u540c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u2005V2O5/TiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u2005SCR\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u2005VOx\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u5206\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u8868\u9762\u9178\u6027\u548c\u9492\u79bb\u5b50\u53ef\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173.",

     "abstract": "A series of CeO2 supported potassium nitrate and carbonate catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method. The catalytic activity and stability for soot oxidation were investigated by thermal gravimetric/differential thermal analysis and temperature-programmed oxidation cycle techniques. K/CeO2 substantially promotes the catalytic activity, which can be gauged by the lowering of the soot total removal temperature by more than 200 \u00b0C compared with the uncatalyzed reaction. The influence of K precursor on the catalytic activity and stability was addressed. The effect is discussed in terms of the combined functions of K and CeO2, potassium mobility and basicity. For potassium-promoted ceria catalysts the potassium nitrate can preserve the high catalytic activity and good stability through several cycles. When K was present as K2CO3, the activity and stability of catalyst were lower than those of KNO3/CeO2. This behavior is attributed to the higher melting point and stronger basicity of K2CO3 which lead to irreversible adsorption of CO2 generated during soot combustion on the catalyst.\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u94be\u76d0\u524d\u4f53\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u2005K/CeO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u70ed\u91cd\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u6c27\u5316\u2005(TPO)\u2005\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005K/CeO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u53ef\u4f7f\u78b3\u9ed1\u5b8c\u5168\u71c3\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd1\u2005200\u2005\u00baC. \u94be\u76d0\u524d\u4f53\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u5f71\u54cd,\u2005\u7531\u4e8e\u785d\u9178\u94be\u7194\u70b9\u4f4e,\u2005\u91d1\u5c5e\u5728\u8f7d\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u5f3a,\u2005\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0e\u78b3\u9ed1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63a5\u89e6,\u2005\u56e0\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u4e09\u6b21\u2005TPO\u2005\u5faa\u73af\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a. \u78b3\u9178\u94be\u7684\u7194\u70b9\u9ad8\u4e14\u78b1\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a,\u2005\u4f7f\u78b3\u9ed1\u71c3\u70e7\u751f\u6210\u7684\u2005CO2\u2005\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u5438\u9644\u5728\u5176\u8868\u9762,\u2005\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4e,\u2005TPO\u2005\u5faa\u73af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u53cd\u5e94\u901f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e,\u2005\u5931\u6d3b\u660e\u663e.",

     "abstract": "Au/ZrO2 catalysts with a nominal gold loading of 1.0% were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method employing a series of ZrO2 samples synthesized by a convenient hydrothermal route as supports. These catalysts were evaluated for low-temperature water-gas shift reaction under a model reformed methanol gas atmosphere. The effect of the hydrothermal synthesis temperature of zirconia on the catalytic activity of Au/ZrO2 was investigated. The optimal hydrothermal synthesis temperature of ZrO2 was 150 \u00b0C. The corresponding catalyst offers a CO conversion of 87% at a reaction temperature of 240 \u00b0C, which is significantly higher than that of the previously reported Au/Fe2O3, Au/CeO2, and Au/CeZrO4 catalysts. The Au/ZrO2 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic absorption spectrometry, N2-physisorption, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicate that the catalytic performance of the Au/ZrO2 catalysts is mainly influenced by the morphology and pore structure of the ZrO2 that was hydrothermally synthesized at different temperatures. A uniform nanodisk morphology and increase in the pore volume and pore diameter of the ZrO2 particles lead to a higher catalytic activity of the Au/ZrO2 catalyst.\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u4fbf\u7684\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u2005ZrO2,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6c89\u79ef-\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5236\u5f97\u76f8\u5e94\u20051.0%\u2005Au/ZrO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7532\u9187\u91cd\u6574\u6c14\u6c14\u6c1b\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f4e\u6e29\u6c34\u7164\u6c14\u53d8\u6362\u2005(WGS)\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u4e8e\u2005150\u2005oC\u2005\u6c34\u70ed\u5408\u6210\u7684\u2005ZrO2\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u2005Au\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u4f73,\u2005240\u2005oC\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u2005CO\u2005\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u8fbe\u200587%,\u2005\u660e\u663e\u9ad8\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u2005Au\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u2005Au/Fe2O3,\u2005Au/CeO2\u2005\u53ca\u2005Au/CeZrO4\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u91c7\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u5149\u8c31\u3001N2\u2005\u7269\u7406\u5438\u8131\u9644\u53ca\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005Au/ZrO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u603b\u5b54\u4f53\u79ef\u53ca\u5e73\u5747\u5b54\u5f84\u8d8a\u5927\u3001\u5706\u5f62\u7247\u72b6\u5f62\u8c8c\u8d8a\u89c4\u6574,\u2005\u5176\u4f4e\u6e29\u2005WGS\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u5c31\u8d8a\u9ad8.",

The equilibrium yield of decyl \u03b2-D-glucoside increased from 1.9% to 6.1% when the water content was reduced from 10% to 5% (v/v) using tert-butanol as a cosolvent and 0.10 mol/L of glucose as a substrate. As for the other longer alkyl chain glucosides, heptyl \u03b2-D-glucoside was found to have significant surface activity as well.\u4f7f\u7528\u9176\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0d\u540c\u70f7\u57fa\u94fe\u957f\u7684\u2005\u03b2-D-\u70f7\u57fa\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\u82f7. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u9664\u7532\u57fa\u7cd6\u82f7\u5916,\u2005\u70f7\u57fa\u78b3\u94fe\u8d8a\u957f,\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u521d\u901f\u5ea6\u8d8a\u4f4e,\u2005\u7cd6\u82f7\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6536\u7387\u8d8a\u4f4e. \u4ece\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cd6\u82f7\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u5e38\u6570\u548c\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u53d8\u5316. \u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5e73\u8861,\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u94fe\u70f7\u57fa\u7cd6\u82f7\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6536\u7387. \u5f53\u6c34\u542b\u91cf\u4ece\u200510%\u2005\u964d\u81f3\u20055%\u2005(v/v),\u2005\u4f7f\u7528\u53d4\u4e01\u9187\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5171\u6eb6\u5242,\u2005\u6dfb\u52a0\u20050.1\u2005mol/L\u2005\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e95\u7269\u65f6,\u2005\u7678\u57fa\u7cd6\u82f7\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u5f97\u7387\u4ece\u20051.9%\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f3\u20056.1%. \u9664\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u957f\u94fe\u7684\u70f7\u57fa\u7cd6\u82f7\u5916,\u2005\u5e9a\u57fa\u7cd6\u82f7\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u6027\u5242\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "Co/CeO2 catalysts with and without calcium doping were prepared by the citric acid complexing method, and characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and high resolution transmission electron microscope. Their catalytic performance measurement for ethanol steam reforming (ESR) at 400\u2013650 \u00b0C and atmospheric pressure with a steam-to-carbon ratio of 3.0 and gas hourly space velocity of 50000 ml/(g\u00b7h) was measured. The citric acid complexing method enhanced metal-support interaction. The Co/CeO2 catalysts gave almost 100% ethanol conversion and good hydrogen yield at 500 \u00b0C. Calcium doping in the catalyst reduced the particle size of CeO2, but had little effect on the metallic cobalt size after reduction. Calcium doping higher than 5% deteriorated the redox properties and ESR catalytic performance, which was attributed to the fouling of CeO2 by CaO. Catalysts activated at 650 \u00b0C showed a better performance, which was due to a higher reduction degree of ceria and increase of the metal-oxide interface. Stability investigation of the catalysts suggested that 5% calcium doping enhanced carbon deposition resistance.\u91c7\u7528\u67e0\u6aac\u9178\u7edc\u5408\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86Co/CeO2\u53ca\u5176\u9499\u63ba\u6742\u7cfb\u5217\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u5e76\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f4e\u6e29N2\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001H2\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u3001\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u8868\u5f81\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e59\u9187\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u91cd\u6574\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u6240\u5236Co/CeO2\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e59\u9187\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u91cd\u6574\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd,500oC\u65f6\u4e59\u9187\u80fd\u5168\u90e8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aC1,\u6c22\u6c14\u4ea7\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe85%\u4ee5\u4e0a.

The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy are used to investigate the physicochemical properties of the CNTs and the prepared catalysts thereof. Cyclic voltammetry, liner current sweeping measurements, chronoamperometry measurements are employed to study the performance of the prepared catalysts. CNTs further treated with IMH H2O2 solution (10s-on/20s-off, over five cycles) can be used as catalyst support, and exhibit significantly improved performance towards the methanol oxidation in comparison with other modified CNTs. The results represent a novel approach to functionalize CNTs in a simple and economic way.

     "abstract": "The reaction mechanism of selective oxidation of ethanol on Au(111) covered with atomic oxygen was described employing density functional theory calculations. The first step, dissociation of the O\u2013H bond in ethanol, has lower barrier for transfer of the H to adsorbed oxygen or surface hydroxyl than to gold with a barrier of 0.20 or 0.17 eV, respectively. The two lower activation energies for the \u03b2-H elimination of ethoxyl, 0.29 and 0.27 eV, come from transfer of H atom to surface O atom or another ethoxyl. Ethyl acetate is formed through the \u03b2-H elimination of ethoxy hemiacetal. The formation of acetic acid is not facile through the reaction between the surface hydroxyl and acetaldehyde or between the surface oxygen and acetaldehyde at low temperature due to a high activation barrier. Except for surface oxygen and bidentate acetate, all other surface species have low diffusion barriers, suggesting that rearrangement and movement of these species from the preferred adsorption sites to the ideal configurations for reactions are facile.\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5438\u9644\u6709O\u539f\u5b50\u7684Au(111)\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u4e59\u9187\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6c27\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u7406. \u53cd\u5e94\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u9664O\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ea7\u7269\u4e8c\u9f7f\u918b\u9178\u6839(CH3CHOO)\u5916,\u5176\u4ed6\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ea7\u7269\u5728Au(111)\u8868\u9762\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u5792\u5747\u8f83\u4f4e,\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u901f\u63a7\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u9020\u6210\u5f71\u54cd. \u4e59\u9187\u7f9f\u57fa\u6c27\u5316\u8131\u6c22\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u9aa4,\u5f53\u6c27\u5316\u5242\u4e3a\u5438\u9644\u6001\u7684O\u539f\u5b50\u6216\u8005\u4e3aOH\u57fa\u65f6,\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.20\u548c0.17eV. \u6c27\u5316\u4ea7\u7269\u4e59\u6c27\u57fa(CH3CH2O)\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6c27\u5316\u8131\u6c22\u751f\u6210\u4e59\u919b\u5219\u9700\u8981\u8868\u9762\u5438\u9644\u7684O\u539f\u5b50\u6216\u53e6\u4e00\u8868\u9762\u5438\u9644\u7684OH\u57fa\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e,\u6240\u9700\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u4e3a0.29\u62160.27eV. \u540c\u65f6,\u4e59\u919b\u6613\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u5438\u9644\u7684\u4e59\u6c27\u57fa\u53cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u4e59\u6c27\u57fa\u534a\u7f29\u919b(CH3CHOOC2H5),\u5176\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e0eO\u539f\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528,\u8131\u6c22\u5f62\u6210\u4e59\u9178\u4e59\u916f. \u6b64\u5916,\u5728\u4e59\u919b\u6df1\u5ea6\u6c27\u5316\u6210\u9178\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u514b\u670d\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u80fd\u5792,\u56e0\u800c\u5728\u8868\u9762\u53cd\u5e94\u6e29\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c,\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u7b26.",

     "abstract": "An inorganic oxide support coupled with a quaternary ammonium salt is an efficient catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide to produce cyclic carbonates under relatively mild reaction conditions (90 \u00b0C, 4 MPa). When tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) was used alone, the activity of the cycloaddition reaction between carbon dioxide and epoxide was only moderate. When an inorganic oxide, especially one that has abundant surface hydroxyl groups was also employed, the reaction was accelerated significantly. This demonstrated that the inorganic oxide and TBAB had a strong synergetic effect for the cycloaddition reaction. Silica was chosen as a model oxide to study the role of surface hydroxyl groups in the reaction. When the surface of silica was silylated with trimethylchlorosilane or dimethyldichlorosilane, the catalytic activity decreased sharply due to surface silylation, which indicated clearly that the surface hydroxyl groups on the silica played a decisive role in influencing the catalytic activity.\u4ee5\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65e0\u673a\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u4e0e\u56db\u4e01\u57fa\u6eb4\u5316\u94f5\u4e3a\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4f53\u7cfb,\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316CO2\u548c\u73af\u6c27\u5316\u5408\u7269\u5408\u6210\u73af\u72b6\u78b3\u9178\u916f\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u5728\u56db\u4e01\u57fa\u6eb4\u5316\u94f5\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u672c\u8eab\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u65e0\u673a\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b,\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u9ad8,\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u534f\u540c\u50ac\u5316\u4f5c\u7528. \u53e6\u5916,\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9SiO2\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7845\u70f7\u57fa\u5316,\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u8868\u9762\u7f9f\u57fa\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd,\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53SiO2\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7845\u70f7\u57fa\u5316\u4ee5\u540e,\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e,\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u673a\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u8868\u9762\u7f9f\u57fa\u5bf9CO2\u73af\u52a0\u6210\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u975e\u5e38\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528.",

     "abstract": "The water-gas shift reaction was used to evaluate a series of La2O3 modified CuO/CeO2 catalysts that were prepared by a parallel co-precipitation method. The catalytic activity and thermal stability improved significantly upon the introduction of La2O3, and CuO/CeO2-La2O3 (2 wt%) gave the highest activity and had the best thermal stability. The microstructure of the as-prepared CuO/CeO2-La2O3 catalysts and/or the CeO2-La2O3 supports was characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, Raman spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. The results indicate that larger specific surface areas and smaller crystal sizes of CuO and CeO2 result in improved catalytic performance for the as-prepared catalysts. Moreover, the incorporation of La3+ into the ceria lattice promotes the generation of oxygen vacancies leading to a higher number of moderate copper oxides that interact with surface oxygen vacancies on the surface of the ceria. This enhances the activity and thermal stability of the CuO/CeO2 catalyst.\u4ee5\u2005La2O3\u2005\u4e3a\u52a9\u5242,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u2005CuO/CeO2-La2O3\u2005\u6c34\u7164\u6c14\u53d8\u6362\u53cd\u5e94\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5176\u4e2d,\u2005\u5f53\u2005La2O3\u2005\u542b\u91cf\u4e3a\u20052\u2005wt%\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4e3a\u4f18\u5f02. \u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u3001Raman\u2005\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5,\u2005\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u2005La2O3\u2005\u5bf9\u2005CuO/CeO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005La2O3\u2005\u52a9\u5242\u8fdb\u5165\u4e86\u8f7d\u4f53\u2005CeO2\u2005\u7684\u6676\u683c\u5e76\u5bf9\u2005CuO/CeO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd,\u2005\u9002\u91cf\u2005La2O3\u2005\u7684\u6dfb\u52a0\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u2005CuO\u2005\u548c\u2005CeO2\u2005\u6676\u683c\u7684\u957f\u5927\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u2005CuO\u2005\u4e0e\u2005CeO2\u2005\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u2005CeO2\u2005\u8f7d\u4f53\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6c27\u7a7a\u4f4d,\u2005CuO/CeO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e5f\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584.",

     "abstract": "A series of MgO/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) composite with different mass ratio were synthesized by impregnation method and used as supports for ruthenium catalysts in ammonia synthesis reaction. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physical adsorption, X-ray fluorescent spectrometer, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, temperature programmed reduction of H2, and temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD). The activity measurements of ammonia synthesis were carried out in a fixed-bed flow reactor with a mixture of N2 and H2 atmosphere under steady-state conditions (5.0 MPa, 350\u2013500 \u00b0C, 5000 h\u22121). The results showed that the rate of ammonia formation was strongly influenced by the h-BN content used in the catalysts preparation process. The Ba-Ru[1:1] (molar ratio of Ba to Ru = 1:1)/MgO/h-BN[8:2] (weight ratio of MgO to h-BN = 8:2), Ba-Ru[1:1]/MgO/h-BN[6:4] and Ba-Ru[1:1]/MgO/h-BN[5:5] catalysts exhibited higher activity than Ba-promoted Ru/MgO catalyst. At 425 \u00b0C, 5.0 MPa, flow rate of 5000 h\u22121, and a N2/H2 = 1/3 atmosphere, the optimum activity of 506.9 ml/(gcat\u00b7h) was achieved when MgO/h-BN [8:2] was used as the catalytic support. The excellent activity was mainly attributed to the basicity of the MgO/h-BN combination-type support, especially \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cmedium\u201d basic sites. Large numbers of basic sites were observed from CO2-TPD characterization due to the interaction between MgO and the h-BN material.\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u7684\u2005MgO/h-BN\u2005\u590d\u5408\u8f7d\u4f53\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u2005Ru\u2005\u57fa\u6c28\u5408\u6210\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u2005\u4f4e\u6e29\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u8367\u5149\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e0a\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6c28\u5408\u6210\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005MgO/h-BN\u2005\u590d\u5408\u8f7d\u4f53\u4e2d\u2005h-BN\u2005\u542b\u91cf\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927,\u2005Ba-Ru[1:1]\u2005(\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4)/MgO/h-BN[8:2]\u2005(\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4),\u2005Ba-Ru[1:1]/MgO/h-BN[6:4]\u548c\u2005Ba-Ru[1:1]/MgO/h-BN[5:5]\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u6c28\u5408\u6210\u6d3b\u6027\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u2005Ba-Ru/MgO\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u5728\u2005425\u2005\u00b0C,\u20055.0\u2005MPa,\u2005N2/H2\u2005=\u20051/3\u2005\u548c\u20055000\u2005h-1\u2005\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005Ba-Ru[1:1]/MgO/h-BN[8:2]\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u8fbe\u2005506.9 ml/(gcat\u00b7h). \u8fd9\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u2005MgO/h-BN\u2005\u590d\u5408\u8f7d\u4f53\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u78b1\u6027\u4f4d,\u2005\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f31\u78b1\u6027\u4f4d\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f3a\u5ea6\u78b1\u6027\u4f4d,\u2005\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u78b1\u6027\u4f4d\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u2005MgO\u2005\u548c\u2005h-BN\u2005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9020\u6210.",

     "abstract": "A series of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by liquid ion exchange, incipient wetness impregnation, and solid-state ion exchange to investigate the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx by NH3 (NH3-SCR). The effect of hydrothermal deactivation of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by different methods as a function of Fe loading was investigated. Freshly made and hydrothermal aged Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts were studied through NH3-SCR activity test and characterized using X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Iron species on the surface of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts were assigned to isolated Fe3+ species, oligomeric FexOy clusters, and Fe2O3 particles based on the UV-Vis spectra. The iron species distributions in the Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by these methods were quite different, which resulted in difference in SCR activity. The NH3-SCR activity of different Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts became very similar after aging, and the activity of NH3 oxidation and NO oxidation decreased with the aged catalysts. Characterization results indicated that the activity change of the aged Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts was due to the change of iron species distribution in Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts after hydrothermal aging. The relative concentration of isolated Fe3+ species was decreased, whereas the relative concentration of oligomeric FexOy clusters and Fe2O3 particles was increased in the aged catalysts. A considerable decrease in the Br\u00f8nsted acidity of catalysts was observed for the aged Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts.\u91c7\u7528\u6db2\u4f53\u79bb\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u3001\u7b49\u4f53\u79ef\u6d78\u6e0d\u548c\u56fa\u76f8\u79bb\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u2005Fe-ZSM-5\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u2005NH3\u2005\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u2005NOx\u2005(NH3-SCR)\u2005\u53cd\u5e94. \u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5438\u6536\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u539f\u4f4d\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005Fe-ZSM-5\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u2005Fe\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u53ef\u5206\u4e3a\u5b64\u7acb\u2005Fe3+\u7269\u79cd\u3001\u4f4e\u805a\u2005Fe\u2005\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u56e2\u7c07\u548c\u2005Fe2O3,\u2005\u5404\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u2005NH3-SCR\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5176\u8868\u9762\u2005Fe\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u540c. \u6c34\u70ed\u8001\u5316\u540e,\u2005Fe-ZSM-5\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u2005400\u2005oC\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0b\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u2005NOx\u2005\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u964d\u4f4e,\u2005\u800c\u9ad8\u6e29\u6d3b\u6027\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u9ad8,\u2005\u5404\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u51cf\u5c0f; \u540c\u65f6\u2005NH3\u2005\u6c27\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u2005NO\u2005\u6c27\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u5747\u660e\u663e\u964d\u4f4e. \u8fd9\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6c34\u70ed\u8001\u5316\u4f7f\u2005Fe-ZSM-5\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5b64\u7acb\u2005Fe3\uff0b\u7269\u79cd\u76f8\u5bf9\u6d53\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e,\u2005\u4f4e\u805a\u2005Fe\u2005\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u56e2\u7c07\u548c\u2005Fe2O3\u2005\u76f8\u5bf9\u6d53\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u4ee5\u53ca\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u2005Br\u00f8nsted\u2005\u9178\u6027\u4f4d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u81f4.",

The catalytic performance of the materials was evaluated in the vapor phase isopropylation of phenol with isopropyl acetate. Phenol conversion decreased with the increase in the Si/Al ratio of the catalysts. The major reaction product was 4-isopropyl phenol with 78% selectivity. The delocalization of phenolic oxygen electron pair over the aromatic ring promoted para-selective alkylation. Such delocalization could be aided by the hydrophilic surface of the molecular sieves. Although an ester was used as the alkylating agent, phenyl isopropyl ether was not formed in the reaction.",

The results indicated that the quadratic model was significant for these two responses. The experimental results revealed that all variables had positive effect on 1-decene conversion. While increasing the catalyst loading tends to decrease LAB yield. Benzene to 1-decene molar ratio was found to be the most important factor that influenced LAB yield with a positive effect. Design expert software suggested several optimized solutions, among them the best choice was to use 31% catalyst loading, benzene to 1-decene molar ratio of 13, and catalyst percent of 3.6 wt% for obtaining 100% conversion and 88% LAB production yield.",

Highly active N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are usually not used directly as catalysts because of their air and moisture sensitivity. Here they were liberated in situ by thermal decarboxylation of ImCO2 at designated temperatures. The results showed that the yield of the reactions reached up to 95% within 3 h using only 0.5 mol% catalyst. No active enol esters, molecular sieves, or a 20-fold excess of alcohol were used to drive the reaction to completion. It was proved that unsaturated imidazolium-2-carboxylates have a better activity than saturated species in this type of reaction. Different types of substituting groups of ImCO2 exhibited varied transesterification activity.\u91c7\u7528\u54aa\u5511\u2005(\u5549)-2-\u7fa7\u9178\u76d0\u2005(ImCO2)\u2005\u4f5c\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u524d\u9a71\u4f53,\u2005\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u8131\u9664\u2005ImCO2\u2005\u7684\u20052-\u4f4d\u7fa7\u9178\u6839,\u2005\u518d\u539f\u4f4d\u91ca\u653e\u51fa\u9ad8\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u2005N-\u6742\u73af\u5361\u5bbe\u2005(NHCs),\u2005\u8fdb\u800c\u50ac\u5316\u8f6c\u916f\u53cd\u5e94. \u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u2005NHCs\u2005\u5728\u82ef\u7532\u9178\u4e59\u916f\u4e0e\u4e00\u5143\u9187\u3001\u4e8c\u5143\u9187\u53ca\u6c28\u57fa\u9187\u53cd\u5e94\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u8be5\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u9009\u7528\u6d3b\u5316\u916f\u4e3a\u539f\u6599,\u2005\u65e0\u9700\u52a0\u5165\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u6216\u52a0\u5927\u9187\u916f\u6bd4\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea7\u7387,\u2005\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u2005(0.5\u2005mol%),\u2005\u5728\u8f83\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u2005(3\u2005h),\u2005\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u53cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u200595%.",

     "abstract": "Using mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) as the support, novel nickel phosphide/m-TiO2 catalysts (Ni2P/m-TiO2) were prepared by a temperature-programmed reduction method. The influence of the Ni/P molar ratio and the amount of active component on the catalyst structure and the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) performance was investigated. The results indicated that the reduction of precursor with Ni/P = 1.25 yielded mainly Ni2P, and the optimum loading of Ni was 10%. The influence of m-TiO2 on the preparation and HDS performance of nickel phosphide catalysts was also evaluated by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. The results showed that m-TiO2 with high crystallinity could dramatically decrease the reduction temperatures of Ni and P species. When the reduction temperatures were between 450 and 600 \u00b0C, the textures of the Ni2P/m-TiO2 catalysts were very similar and the specific surface areas were about 90 m2/g. The effects of the support on the dibenzothiophene HDS performance of the nickel phosphide catalysts were also investigated.

They provide crucial features for industrial applications, such as high surface area, uniform porosity, inter-connected pore/channel system, accessible pore volume, high adsorption capacity, ion-exchange ability, enhanced catalytic activity, and shape/size selectivity. As a well-established family of nanoporous materials, zeolites are of vital importance for the chemical and petrochemical industries. An emerging class of porous materials called metal organic frameworks (MOFs) also offer promise in various applications. Both zeolites and MOFs can play significant roles in fields that are critical for the future of our industrialized society. In the quest for raw material change, zeolites serve as catalysts providing the required shape/size selectivity towards base chemicals. In global efforts to transition into other transportation fuels such as Hydrogen, MOFs serve as the energy storage media. In the fight against environmental pollution, zeolites not only take part in capture and abatement of harmful substances, but also offer environmentally benign alternatives for many industrial processes. In this review, an industrial perspective on the synthesis and utilization of zeolites and MOFs for current and future applications is presented.",

     "abstract": "Rational and efficient conversion of methane to more useful higher hydrocarbons is one of the most important topics of natural gas utilization. Although methane activation and its conversion to valuable compounds attract an increasing attention, methane conversion is often made in indirect way through the very energy-consuming step for syngas production from steam reforming of methane. Some promising results appeared to be of significance for the development of an alternative and potential route for the production of high value-added products from methane. Efficient conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons could be realized via methyl halide as the intermediate. After the production of halomethane, they could be transformed to gasoline and light olefins over modified zeolites and SAPO molecular sieves. High conversion efficiency and selectivity indicated the feasibility of industrial application. The research gained recently growing interest from the point of view in both fundamental research and industrial application. The study on the reaction mechanism shed light on the possible route of C\u2013C bond construction from methyl halide, which is the very important issue of the C1-reactant conversion to higher hydrocarbons. Hydrogen halide generation during methyl halide conversion did not exert apparent impact on the reaction mechanism and the structure stability of the catalysts. This review deals with the evolution of the field and comments the advantages to be explored and the drawbacks to be prevented for the development of new and sustainable methane-to-olefins (MTO) and methane-to-gasoline (MTG) routes via methyl halides.",

     "abstract": "Perhydroindan (bicyclo[4.3.0]nonane) was converted in a flow-type apparatus under a hydrogen pressure of 5 MPa on six different catalysts, namely on a bifunctional Pd/Na,H-Beta zeolite, on Ir/Na,H-Y and Pt/Na,H-Y zeolites with a low concentration of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites, and on three catalysts containing the three noble metals on the non-acidic support silica. On the bifunctional zeolite Pd/Na,H-Beta, skeletal isomerization of perhydroindan was the primary reaction followed by opening of one naphthenic ring, the formation of open-chain nonanes in low yields of ca. 6%, and hydrocracked products C8-. The carbon number distribution of the latter was volcano-shaped with no C1, C2, C7, and C8 indicating a carbocationic hydrocracking of C9 precursors with one naphthenic ring. On Ir/Na,H-Y and Pt/Na,H-Y (\u201chigh-performance ring-opening catalysts\u201d), ring opening and hydrocracking to C8- occurred by hydrogenolysis on the respective metal. Opening of the five-membered ring was found to be much faster than opening of the six-membered ring, in agreement with literature reports. The maximal selectivities of open-chain nonanes (OCNs) attained on Ir/Na,H-Y and Pt/Na,H-Y were very high, viz. 49% and 54%, respectively, and significantly better than those of the open-chain decanes observed previously with decalin as model hydrocarbon. The OCNs formed on Pt/Na,H-Y were much less branched than those formed on Ir/Na,H-Y which was interpreted in terms of the different hydrogenolysis mechanisms on both metals. Valuable ancillary mechanistic information was obtained from the selectivities of perhydroindan hydroconversion on the three noble metals on silica. In contrast to Pd/silica, Ir/silica and Pt/silica gave appreciable selectivities of OCNs as well, yet the maximum values of these selectivities were lower than those obtained on the two high-performance zeolite catalysts.",

The design and synthesis of Cu-SSZ-13 using a novel template of a low-cost copper amine complex (Cu2+ coordinated with tetraethylenepentamine) were reported, where the copper amine complex is both a template for synthesizing the SSZ-13 structure and a source of copper species in the zeolite. The calculated size of the complex (0.728 nm \u00d7 0.922 nm) matches well with the CHA cages (0.73 nm \u00d7 1.2 nm), which are the building units of the SSZ-13 zeolite. Various techniques were used to investigate the chemical and physical properties of the synthesized zeolite. The results showed that the sample has the SSZ-13 zeolite structure, high crystallinity, adjustable Si/Al ratios, and controllable copper loading. Catalytic tests using the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 showed that the Cu-SSZ-13 was a superior catalyst, and it can be important for the abatement of environmentally harmful NOx.\u4ee5\u4f4e\u5ec9\u7684\u94dc\u80fa\u7edc\u5408\u7269\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u677f\u5242,\u2005\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u542b\u94dc\u7684\u2005SSZ-13\u2005\u6cb8\u77f3\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u2005(Cu-ZJM-1). \u5728\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d,\u2005\u94dc\u80fa\u7edc\u5408\u7269\u65e2\u662f\u6a21\u677f\u5206\u5b50,\u2005\u53c8\u662f\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u7ec4\u5206\u94dc\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6765\u6e90. \u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u8be5\u6a21\u677f\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6784\u578b\u4e0e\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6070\u597d\u4e0e\u6784\u6210\u2005SSZ-13\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u2005CHA\u2005\u7b3c\u76f8\u5339\u914d,\u2005\u56e0\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5bfc\u5411\u8be5\u6cb8\u77f3\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7ed3\u6784. \u91c7\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u6c2e\u6c14\u5438\u9644\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u3001\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u5438\u6536\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u5dee\u70ed-\u70ed\u91cd\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6c28\u6c14\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u53ca\u6c22\u6c14\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u6a21\u677f\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u6240\u5236\u2005Cu-ZJM-1\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6676\u5ea6\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u2005SSZ-13\u2005\u6cb8\u77f3\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u7845\u94dd\u6bd4\u548c\u94dc\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u53ef\u8c03\u4e14\u94dc\u5904\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u6563\u72b6\u6001,\u2005\u5728\u2005NH3\u2005\u9009\u62e9\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u6c2e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd.",

     "abstract": "FeAlPO4-5 samples with various iron contents were investigated by UV resonance Raman spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of FeAlPO4-5 show four feature bands related to the framework iron at 630, 1060, 1140, and 1210 cm\u22121 when excited by 266 nm laser. It is found that only part of ferric ions could enter into the framework, while the others exist in the extra-framework in the form of six-coordinated state. This kind of iron gives characteristic Raman band at 285 cm\u22121. Combined with UV resonance Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, the crystallization process of FeAlPO4-5 (Al/Fe = 760) was studied. It is found that, in the early stages of the crystallization, the iron species exist in the form of six-coordinated state while attached to the end of the 1-dimensional AlPO4 chain. The Fe\u2013O bonds in the six-coordinated state hamper the crystallization of AlPO4. The crystallization of the FeAlPO4-5 began when the reaction between the 1-dimensional AlPO4 chains occurred. At the same time, the six-coordinated ferric ions converted to the tetrahedral iron.\u5229\u7528\u7d2b\u5916\u5171\u632f\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u94c1\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u2005FeAlPO4-5\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005FeAlPO4-5\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u94c1\u6709\u20054\u2005\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u62c9\u66fc\u8c31\u5cf0,\u2005\u5206\u522b\u4f4d\u4e8e\u2005630,\u20051060,\u20051140\u2005\u548c\u20051210\u2005cm-1. \u5f53\u51dd\u80f6\u4e2d\u2005Al/Fe\u2005\u6bd4\u5c0f\u4e8e\u2005380\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u94c1\u79bb\u5b50\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5165\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u5f62\u6210\u56db\u914d\u4f4d\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u94c1\u7269\u79cd; \u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5219\u4ee5\u9aa8\u67b6\u5916\u516d\u914d\u4f4d\u7684\u94c1\u7269\u79cd\u5b58\u5728,\u2005\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u62c9\u66fc\u8c31\u5cf0\u4f4d\u4e8e\u2005285\u2005cm-1. \u7ed3\u5408\u7d2b\u5916\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u2005Al/Fe\u2005\u6bd4\u4e3a\u2005760\u2005\u65f6\u2005FeAlPO4-5\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7684\u6676\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b. \u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u6676\u5316\u524d,\u2005\u94c1\u7269\u79cd\u4ee5\u516d\u914d\u4f4d\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728,\u2005\u5b83\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u524d\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u94fe\u72b6\u78f7\u9178\u94dd\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u60f0\u6027\u7aef\u57fa,\u2005\u516d\u914d\u4f4d\u7684\u2005Fe-O\u2005\u952e\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u5b83\u4e0e\u5176\u5b83\u78f7\u9178\u94dd\u7269\u79cd\u53d1\u751f\u53cd\u5e94; \u5f53\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u5f00\u59cb\u6676\u5316\u65f6,\u2005\u5e26\u6709\u94c1\u79bb\u5b50\u7aef\u57fa\u7684\u78f7\u9178\u94dd\u94fe\u4e0e\u5176\u5b83\u78f7\u9178\u94dd\u94fe\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53cd\u5e94\u5f62\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u9aa8\u67b6. \u540c\u65f6,\u2005\u516d\u914d\u4f4d\u7684\u94c1\u79bb\u5b50\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684\u78f7\u9178\u94dd\u7269\u79cd\u53cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56db\u914d\u4f4d\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u94c1\u7269\u79cd.",

The moderate vapor phase sulfonation of the CS composite with fuming sulfuric acid (H2SO4\u00b720%SO3) was the key step in preparing the strong acid solid material (CS-SO3H). Structural analysis and reaction data revealed that sulfonic acid groups were successfully incorporated into the mesoporous CS composite, and the Br\u00f8nsted acid site density was tunable from 0.09 to 0.70 mmol/g by tuning the carbon loading.

Lanthanide (La, Ce, Pr, Nd) loaded ETS-10 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, 29Si magic angle spinning NMR, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption measurement, and X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The degradation of methyl orange under near-UV light was used to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the catalysts in aqueous suspensions. The lanthanide loaded ETS-10 catalysts exhibit higher activity than the unmodified ETS-10. The combination of loading lanthanide and increasing the surface defects of ETS-10 by a HF treatment gave an enhancement of the photocatalytic activity, which became comparable with that of anatase TiO2.\u4ee5\u6c34\u73bb\u7483\u548c\u56db\u6c2f\u5316\u949b\u4e3a\u539f\u6599,\u2005\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u673a\u6a21\u677f\u5242\u3001\u6c1f\u79bb\u5b50\u548c\u6676\u79cd\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005\u7528\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u949b-\u7845\u6cb8\u77f3\u2005ETS-10,\u2005\u5c06\u2005La\u3001Ce\u3001Pr\u2005\u548c\u2005Nd\u2005\u56db\u79cd\u7a00\u571f\u5143\u7d20\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5230\u5408\u6210\u7684\u2005ETS-10\u2005\u4e0a. \u901a\u8fc7\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u7c89\u672b\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u300129Si\u2005\u9b54\u89d2\u65cb\u8f6c\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u3001\u7d2b\u5916\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u8868\u5f81\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u8d1f\u8f7d\u524d\u540e\u7684\u2005ETS-10\u2005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u4ee5\u6709\u673a\u67d3\u6599\u7532\u57fa\u6a59\u4e3a\u5e95\u7269,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5404\u79cd\u7a00\u571f\u53ca\u6c22\u6c1f\u9178\u8150\u8680\u5bf9\u2005ETS-10\u2005\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u56db\u79cd\u7a00\u571f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u5747\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u2005ETS-10\u2005\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a00\u571f\u5143\u7d20\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u6709\u5173. \u5bf9\u2005ETS-10\u2005\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6c22\u6c1f\u9178\u8150\u8680\u548c\u7a00\u571f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d,\u2005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u2005ETS-10\u2005\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd1\u4e00\u500d,\u2005\u4e0e\u9510\u949b\u77ff\u76f8\u2005TiO2\u2005\u76f8\u5f53,\u2005\u4f46\u524d\u8005\u66f4\u6613\u5206\u79bb.",

     "abstract": "Br\u00f8nsted/Lewis acid sites synergy in H-MCM-22 zeolite was studied by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Two-dimensional 1H double quantum-magic angle spinning (DQ-MAS) NMR revealed the details of the spatial relationship between the Lewis and the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites in a dealuminated H-MCM-22 zeolite, which implied the existence of a Br\u00f8nsted/Lewis acid sites synergy. Two-dimensional 27Al DQ-MAS NMR was used to give the details of the spatial proximities of various aluminum species. The Br\u00f8nsted/Lewis acid sites synergy occurred in the supercage of the H-MCM-22 zeolite between a T6 site Al and extra-framework Al species. 13C CP/MAS NMR of adsorbed acetone demonstrated that the spatial proximities of the Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis acid sites led to a synergy that enhanced the Br\u00f8nsted acid strength of the dealuminated zeolites. 1H MAS NMR of adsorbed deuterated pyridine confirmed that the Br\u00f8nsted/Lewis acid sites synergy occurred in the supercage of H-MCM-22. This finding is important for understanding the mechanism of acid-catalyzed reactions in H-MCM-22 zeolites.\u91c7\u7528\u5404\u79cd\u56fa\u4f53\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u2005(NMR)\u2005\u6280\u672f\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u2005H-MCM-22\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e2d\u2005Br\u00f8nsted/Lewis\u2005\u9178\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94. \u4e8c\u7ef4\u20051H\u2005\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u9b54\u89d2\u65cb\u8f6c\u2005(DQ-MAS)\u2005NMR\u2005\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u8131\u94dd\u2005H-MCM-22\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e2d\u2005Br\u00f8nsted\u2005\u9178\u4f4d\u2005(\u9aa8\u67b6\u6865\u5f0f\u7f9f\u57fa)\u2005\u548c\u2005Lewis\u2005\u9178\u4f4d\u2005(\u975e\u9aa8\u67b6\u94dd\u7f9f\u57fa)\u2005\u4e4b\u95f4\u662f\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684,\u2005\u6697\u793a\u7740\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u2005B/L\u2005\u9178\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94. \u4e8c\u7ef4\u200527Al\u2005DQ-MAS\u2005NMR\u2005\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u94dd\u7269\u79cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027,\u2005\u8868\u660e\u2005B/L\u2005\u9178\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u2005H-MCM-22\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u8d85\u7b3c\u4e2d\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u2005T6\u2005\u4f4d\u94dd\u548c\u975e\u9aa8\u67b6\u94dd\u7269\u79cd\u4e4b\u95f4. 2-13C-\u4e19\u916e\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u56e0\u2005B/L\u2005\u9178\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8131\u94dd\u2005H-MCM-22\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u9178\u6027\u660e\u663e\u589e\u5f3a,\u2005\u6c18\u4ee3\u5421\u5576\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5728\u2005H-MCM-22\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7684\u8d85\u7b3c\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u2005B/L\u2005\u9178\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94. \u4e0a\u8ff0\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u8131\u94dd\u2005H-MCM-22\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e0a\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u591a\u76f8\u50ac\u5316\u673a\u7406.",

The modified SBA-15 kept its ordered meso-structure well even when kept under boiling water for 14 d or 100 % H2O stream at 800 \u00b0C for 12 h, and still had BET surface areas as high as 310 and 213 m2/g, respectively, after these treatments. Two possible reasons for the stabilization were: (i) surface defects of SBA-15 were partially repaired by silicon insertion and (ii) some silicon hydroxyls were replaced by F\u2212 ions.

The adaptability of the combined alkaline treatment method and steaming toward the type of starting NaY zeolites was studied. By comparison with single steaming treatment the combination of sequential alkaline treatment and steaming affords products with an obviously increased mesopore volume. The level of framework ultrastabilization and acidity of the final products were not affected. The mesopore volume of the ultrastable Y zeolite prepared by steaming dealumination only was no more than 0.14 cm3/g. The mesopore volume of the final product prepared by sequential desilication and dealumination was 0.22 cm3/g. The sequential desilication and dealumination method is suitable for the NaY zeolite with a high framework silica to alumina ratio. A small increase in the mesopore volume and severe micropore damage were evident when the NaY zeolite with a relatively low silica to alumina ratio (SiO2/Al2O3 = 4.8, determined by nuclear magnetic resonance) was used as the starting material for the combined desilication and dealumination treatment.\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u2005\u201c\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u201d\u4ee5\u53ca\u201c\u78b1\u5904\u7406+\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u201d\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u5236\u5f97\u7684\u8d85\u7a33\u2005Y\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u7845\u94dd\u6bd4\u3001\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u53ca\u9178\u91cf,\u2005\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u201c\u78b1\u5904\u7406+\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8d77\u59cb\u2005NaY\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u524d,\u2005\u5bf9\u2005NaY\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u8fdb\u884c\u78b1\u5904\u7406\u8131\u7845\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6700\u7ec8\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u8d85\u7a33\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u9178\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6,\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u4ecb\u5b54\u4f53\u79ef\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0. \u76f4\u63a5\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u2005NaY\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u6240\u5f97\u6837\u54c1\u4ecb\u5b54\u4f53\u79ef\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u20050.14\u2005cm3/g,\u2005\u800c\u5148\u78b1\u5904\u7406\u540e\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406,\u2005\u6240\u5f97\u6837\u54c1\u4ecb\u5b54\u4f53\u79ef\u53ef\u8fbe\u20050.22\u2005cm3/g. \u8be5\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5236\u5907\u9aa8\u67b6\u7845\u94dd\u6bd4\u9ad8\u7684\u2005NaY\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b. \u8d77\u59cb\u539f\u6599\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u7845\u94dd\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6,\u2005\u6240\u5f97\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u4ecb\u5b54\u4f53\u79ef\u589e\u5e45\u5c0f,\u2005\u800c\u4e14\u5fae\u5b54\u53d7\u635f\u4e25\u91cd.",

The Al source has a great influence on the resulting sample composition. SAPO-34 could also be synthesized using triethylamine (TEA), morpholine (MOR), and a DEA-TEA mixture, respectively. The products were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, and 29Si MAS NMR. The level of silicon incorporation into the SAPO-34 framework decreased in the following order of SAPO-34 (DEA) > SAPO-34 (MOR) > SAPO-34 (TEA).

     "abstract": "ZSM-5 zeolite in the form of crystalline nanoclusters was synthesized from seeds functionalized by organosilane and its catalytic performance in the benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbon by benzyl chloride was investigated. The zeolite samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that they were composed of aggregates of nanocrystals about 20 nm. They had high external surface area that was five times that of conventional ZSM-5. The amounts of acid sites were increased, which was indicated by acidity characterization by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3. Moreover, accessibility to the acid sites was improved by reducing the size of crystals to nanoscale. In the benzylation of aromatics by benzyl chloride, nanoscale ZSM-5 showed a much higher activity than conventional ZSM-5 because the diffusional limitation for the large reactant was decreased in the nanoscale ZSM-5 zeolite. The benzyl chloride conversion in the benzylation of toluene was 98% at 363 K for 10 h, which was 3.6 times higher than that over conventional ZSM-5. The apparent rate constant over the nanoscale ZSM-5 zeolite was ca. 13 times larger than that over conventional ZSM-5.\u91c7\u7528\u6676\u79cd\u6709\u673a\u7845\u70f7\u5316\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u56e2\u7c07\u2005ZSM-5\u2005\u6cb8\u77f3,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u82b3\u70c3\u82c4\u57fa\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027.

Its ligninolytic peroxidase-like catalytic activity was studied. The coordinated mercapto ligand significantly affected the catalytic features of the catalyst because the oxidation of lignin-model compounds was very slow by comparison with imidazole- and pyridine-coordinated immobilized metalloporphines. Conversely, the catalyst efficiently bleached several industrial dyes and thus demon-strated promising activity for this application. Based on this altered substrate specificity the oxygen-donor catalytic route seems to be more favorable than a single electron oxidation pathway.",

The 4% Pt catalysts supported on Al2O3@FDU-14 were prepared by impregnation using H2PtCl6. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption characterization of the Pt/Al2O3@FDU-14 catalysts indicated that the mesoporous features of the FDU-14 mesopolymer were retained. The Pt/Al2O3@FDU-14 catalysts were used in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate after they were chirally modified with cinchonidine. For Al2O3 loading from 5% to 15%, Al2O3 was uniformly dispersed inside the mesoporous channels of FDU-14 host. Ethyl pyruvate conversion and their ee values increased with increasing alumina loading, with a highest ee value of 80%. It was suggested that the alumina coating inside the mesoporous channels of FDU-14 decreased the surface electronic density of the FDU-14 mesopolymer so that cinchonidine can be easily adsorbed on the surface of Pt/Al2O3@FDU-14 catalysts.

The principal component of the Pd nanoparticles was determined to be Pd0 with a Pd 3d5/2 binding energy at 335.6 eV. The as-made catalyst was applied to the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Its effects on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol were investigated in detail including the amount of catalyst, the solvent, the temperature, and the catalytic activities of recycling. The results indicated that benzaldehyde could be selectively synthesized from benzyl alcohol upon catalysis by Pd/Fe@C. The conversion of benzyl alcohol was 96% and the selectivity for benzaldehyde was 95% when using 0.5 mol% Pd/Fe@C catalyst with acetonitrile as a solvent under an oxygen atmosphere at 80 \u00b0C. The catalyst can be easily separated magnetically and high catalytic activity was retained after recycling the catalyst four times.\u4ee5\u78b3\u5305\u94c1\u7eb3\u7c73\u6676\u2005(Fe@C)\u2005\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u78c1\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u2005Pd/Fe@C\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u548c\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u2005Pd\u2005\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u7c92\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u20054\u223c10\u2005nm,\u2005\u5e73\u5747\u7c92\u5f84\u7ea6\u4e3a\u20057\u2005nm,\u2005Pd\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u4ee5\u2005Pd0\u2005\u4e3a\u4e3b,\u2005\u5176\u2005Pd\u20053d5/2\u2005\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u4e3a\u2005335.6\u2005eV. \u5c06\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u82ef\u7532\u9187\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7528\u91cf\u3001\u6eb6\u5242\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4f7f\u7528\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u53ef\u4f7f\u82ef\u7532\u9187\u9ad8\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u751f\u6210\u82ef\u7532\u919b,\u2005\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7528\u91cf\u2005(\u6469\u5c14\u5206\u6570)\u2005\u4e3a\u20050.5%\u3001\u4e59\u8148\u4e3a\u6eb6\u5242\u300180\u2005oC\u2005\u5e38\u538b\u2005O2\u2005\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005\u82ef\u7532\u9187\u7684\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u2005(\u82ef\u7532\u9187\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u4e3a\u200596%,\u2005\u82ef\u7532\u919b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e3a\u200595%). \u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6613\u4e8e\u78c1\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u56de\u6536,\u2005\u5faa\u73af\u4f7f\u7528\u20054\u2005\u6b21\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f73\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd.",

     "abstract": "The preparation of zeolite ZSM-5 without using a template was extensively investigated. Zeolite ZSM-5 small particle aggregates were synthesized in the absence of a template using sodium silicate as the silica source and by controlling the nucleation time at high temperature with a simple two-step method in a rotating autoclave on a spit within an oven. The first stage at higher temperature consisted of accelerating the nucleation and the second stage at lower temperature consisted of obtaining small crystals in the absence of a template. The resulting zeolites were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption, and N2 adsorption. Compared with the micron-sized zeolite crystals that are synthesized in the one-step method, zeolite ZSM-5 small particles prepared by the two-step method have a higher specific surface area and an equivalent acid site content. The sample synthesized by the two-step method mainly contains Br\u00f6nsted acid sites and a few Lewis acid sites indicating that Al is incorporated into the framework of the zeolite.\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u677f\u5242\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b,\u2005\u4ee5\u7845\u9178\u94a0\u4e3a\u7845\u6e90\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53d8\u6e29\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5,\u2005\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u9ad8\u6e29\u9884\u6676\u5316\u65f6\u95f4,\u2005\u5728\u8f6c\u52a8\u70d8\u7bb1\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u5c0f\u9897\u7c92\u2005ZSM-5\u2005\u6cb8\u77f3\u56e2\u805a\u4f53. \u9ad8\u6e29\u9884\u6676\u5316\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u52a0\u5feb\u53cd\u5e94\u6db2\u7684\u6210\u6838,\u2005\u800c\u4f4e\u6e29\u6676\u5316\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u5c0f\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u6676\u4f53. \u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04,\u2005\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c,\u2005NH3\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u548c\u2005N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u7684\u2005ZSM-5\u2005\u6cb8\u77f3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u4e0e\u4e00\u6b65\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u9897\u7c92\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f83,\u2005\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5c0f\u9897\u7c92\u56e2\u805a\u4f53\u2005ZSM-5\u2005\u6cb8\u77f3\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u76f8\u540c\u9178\u91cf. \u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6cb8\u77f3\u7684\u2005Br\u00f6nsted\u2005\u9178\u4f4d\u5360\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u5206,\u2005Lewis\u2005\u9178\u4f4d\u8f83\u5c11,\u2005\u4e5f\u8bf4\u660e\u2005Al\u2005\u57fa\u672c\u8fdb\u5165\u6cb8\u77f3\u9aa8\u67b6\u4e2d.",

     "abstract": "Palladium catalyst systems are the most widely used for the formation of C-C and C-N bonds. Environmentally friendly heterogeneous palladium catalysts have strongly stimulated growth in this research area. Herein, a FDU (Fudan University)-15 mesopolymer with p6mm mesostructures that combine the advantages of organic polymers and mesoporous materials was investigated as a new solid support for Pd complexes. The FDU-15 mesopolymer-supported N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursor was developed by a simple chemical functionalization approach. It has been used as a phosphine-free ligand to prepare the novel heterogeneous palladium catalyst FDU-NHC/Pd(II), which efficiently catalyzes Sonogashira reactions between aryl halides and terminal alkynes to afford the corresponding products in good yields. Various techniques such as X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been used to characterize the catalyst. The results indicate that the mesoporous structure of FDU-15 was not affected by immobilization, however, the pore diameter, pore volume, and BET surface area decrease. The stability of the heterogeneous catalyst was also studied. The FDU-NHC/Pd(II) complex catalyst was easily separated from the reaction system by a simple filtration of the reaction mixture and it has been shown to be robust without a significant loss of catalytic activity after recycling and reuse in 10 times.\u65b0\u578b\u6709\u673a\u4ecb\u5b54\u6750\u6599\u2005FDU-15\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5361\u5bbe\u914d\u4f53\u7edc\u5408\u918b\u9178\u94af\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u2005FDU-NHC/Pd(II)\u2005\u7684\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355,\u2005\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b65\u53cd\u5e94\u5373\u53ef\u5236\u5f97,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5b83\u5728\u2005Sonogashira\u2005\u5076\u8054\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u2005FDU-15\u2005\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u4ecb\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u4ec5\u5176\u5b54\u5f84\u3001\u5b54\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u2005BET\u2005\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u6709\u6240\u51cf\u5c0f. \u53e6\u5916,\u2005\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u2005Sonogashira\u2005\u5076\u8054\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u5e95\u7269\u666e\u9002\u6027\u597d,\u2005\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5e26\u6709\u5438\u7535\u5b50\u53d6\u4ee3\u57fa\u8fd8\u662f\u4f9b\u7535\u5b50\u53d6\u4ee3\u57fa\u7684\u7898\u82ef\u90fd\u80fd\u591f\u5f97\u5230\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u4ea7\u7387,\u2005\u4e14\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5206\u79bb\u7b80\u5355,\u2005\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u200510\u2005\u6b21\u4ee5\u4e0a\u65f6,\u2005\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8.",

Their catalytic activities were evaluated for the vapor phase aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity and the conversion of benzyl alcohol depended on the vanadia content while the catalyst with 15 wt% V2O5 content showed optimum activity. The characterization results suggest the presence of well-dispersed V2O5 and partially disintegrated Keggin ions of MPA on the support. In situ Raman studies showed a reduced Mo(IV) species when the catalysts were calcined at high temperatures. The high oxidation activity of the catalysts is related to the synergistic effect between MPA and V2O5",

     "abstract": "The effect of using polar liquid as the reaction medium for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on the product distribution was studied. The experiments were performed with an industrial iron-based catalyst in a batch autoclave reactor with different liquid phases (polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene glycol 600, 1,4-butanediol, and glycol). The reaction conditions were temperature of 200\u2013240 \u00b0C, initial H2/CO molar ratios of 1.00\u20132.03, catalyst particle sizes of 20\u201340 mesh and > 150 mesh, and reaction time of 24\u2013144 h. The \u03b1-olefin selectivity was significantly increased to more than 70% and was almost independent of carbon number with all the polar liquids. Most of the hydrocarbon distribution were not of the ideal Anderson-Schulz-Flory pattern and could not be explained by the mechanism of olefin readsorption and secondary reactions. The chain growth probability \u03b1 was larger than 0.85 for all conditions, and it was slightly influenced by changes of reaction conditions, liquid, and reaction time. There was product separation during reaction in this catalytic system, which meant that it did not have the problem of separating the catalyst from the wax product that traditional slurry reactors have. The result suggested new opportunities for the selective production of linear \u03b1-olefins and for mechanistic investigations of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.\u5728\u95f4\u6b47\u53cd\u5e94\u91dc\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6781\u6027\u6eb6\u5242\u4e2d\u5de5\u4e1a\u94c1\u57fa\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u8d39\u6258\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u70b9,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6781\u6027\u6eb6\u5242\u2005(\u805a\u4e59\u4e8c\u9187\u2005400\u2005\u548c\u2005600,\u20051,4-\u4e01\u4e8c\u9187,\u2005\u4e59\u4e8c\u9187)\u2005\u548c\u975e\u6781\u6027\u6eb6\u5242\u6b63\u8f9b\u70f7,\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u2005(\u6e29\u5ea6,\u2005\u8fdb\u6599\u2005H2/CO\u2005\u6bd4,\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4)\u2005\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u2005(\u95f4\u6b47,\u2005\u534a\u8fde\u7eed)\u2005\u5bf9\u4ea7\u7269\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u94fe\u589e\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u2005\u03b1\u2005\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.\u2005\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u6240\u8003\u5bdf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005\u4ea7\u7269\u4e2d\u2005\u03b1-\u70ef\u70c3\u2005(\u9664\u4e86\u4e59\u70ef)\u2005\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u968f\u78b3\u6570\u53d8\u5316,\u2005\u8fd9\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u6781\u6027\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8d39\u6258\u5408\u6210,\u2005\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u751f\u4ea7\u7ebf\u6027\u2005\u03b1-\u70ef\u70c3\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49. \u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6,\u2005\u4ea7\u7269\u4e2d\u2005\u03b1-\u70ef\u70c3\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u542b\u91cf\u53ef\u8d85\u8fc7\u200570%. \u4ea7\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u5927\u591a\u504f\u79bb\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u2005ASF\u2005\u5206\u5e03,\u2005\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u70ef\u70c3\u518d\u5438\u9644\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u89e3\u91ca. \u94fe\u589e\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u2005\u03b1\u2005\u5747\u5927\u4e8e\u20050.85,\u2005\u8868\u660e\u6781\u6027\u4ecb\u8d28\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u957f\u94fe\u70c3\u7684\u751f\u6210.",

     "abstract": "Titania-pillared clays (TiO2-PILC) were synthesized by ion exchange and manganese was introduced as the active phase. The catalytic behavior of the xMn/TiO2-PILC catalysts was studied for the low-temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3. A series of Ce-doped 8%Mn-yCe/TiO2-PILC catalysts were prepared and evaluated for their performance in the low-temperature SCR of NO with NH3, their resistance to water vapor (H2O), and their resistance to sulfur dioxide (SO2). It was found that the NO conversion properties of the 8%Mn/TiO2-PILC catalysts could be significantly improved by adding Ce and all the catalysts gave high resistance to H2O but were sensitive to SO2. The catalyst with a Ce loading of 2% gave 95% NO conversion at 220 \u00b0C and exhibited a moderate SO2-poisoning resistance compared with the other catalysts. X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction of H2 were used to characterize the properties of the catalysts. The addition of Ce improved the diffusion of Mn on the surfaces of the catalysts, which enhanced the surface acidity and improved the reduction properties of the catalysts and these were the main influencing factors for the low-temperature SCR.\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u949b\u57fa\u5c42\u67f1\u7c98\u571f\u2005(TiO2-PILC),\u2005\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5c06\u2005Mn\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e8e\u5176\u4e0a\u5236\u5f97\u4e0d\u540c\u2005Mn\u2005\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u2005xMn/TiO2-PILCs\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4f4e\u6e29\u2005NH3\u2005\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u2005NO\u2005(NH3-SCR)\u2005\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6dfb\u52a0\u2005Ce\u2005\u5bf9\u20058%Mn/TiO2-PILC\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u6297\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u6297\u2005SO2\u2005\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005TiO2-PILC\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u9530\u57fa\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6297\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u6027\u80fd,\u2005\u4f46\u5728\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u548c\u2005SO2\u2005\u5171\u5b58\u65f6\u5931\u6d3b\u4e25\u91cd.

     "abstract": "Sodium tantalate photocatalysts with a perovskite structure (NaTaO3), a pyrochlore structure (Na2Ta2O6), and a nano-heterojunction (NaTaO3/Na2Ta2O6) structure were controllably synthesized using the hydrothermal method. Sodium carbonate, sodium stearate, and sodium acetate were used as precursors, respectively. The physical properties of the as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The effects of the sodium precursor on the structure of sodium tantalate are discussed. The photocatalytic results indicated that the activity for the H2 evolution half-reaction from water splitting was in the following order: NaTaO3/Na2Ta2O6 > NaTaO3 > Na2Ta2O6. The highest photocatalytic activity of NaTaO3/Na2Ta2O6 can be attributed to heterojunction formation within the nanoparticles, which significantly enhanced the separation of the electron-hole pairs.\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u94a0\u6e90,\u2005\u5728\u6c34\u70ed\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u7ed3\u6784\u2005NaTaO3\u3001\u70e7\u7eff\u77f3\u7ed3\u6784\u2005Na2Ta2O6\u2005\u4ee5\u53ca\u2005NaTaO3/Na2Ta2O6\u2005\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u578b\u590d\u5408\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5408\u6210,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u3001\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u94a0\u6e90\u5bf9\u6240\u5f97\u94bd\u9178\u94a0\u6837\u54c1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u5149\u89e3\u6c34\u6790\u6c22\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5404\u94bd\u9178\u76d0\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u987a\u5e8f\u4e3a\u2005NaTaO3/Na2Ta2O6\u2005>\u2005NaTaO3\u2005>\u2005Na2Ta2O6.

X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the specially configured Pt-Bi nanoparticles in 5%Pt-5%Bi/C were highly dispersed (3.8 nm) over the active carbon support, which is proposed to contribute to the improved performance.\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6d3b\u6027\u78b3\u2005(AC)\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u2005Pt-Bi\u2005\u53cc\u91d1\u5c5e\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u2005Bi\u2005\u542b\u91cf\u5bf9\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u7518\u6cb9\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u9002\u91cf\u2005Bi\u2005\u7684\u6dfb\u52a0\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u2005Pt\u2005\u7684\u6c27\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u80fd,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u548c\u4e8c\u7f9f\u57fa\u4e19\u916e\u2005(DIHA)\u2005\u4ea7\u7269\u7684\u751f\u6210. \u5f53\u2005Bi\u2005\u7684\u542b\u91cf\u4e3a\u20055%\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u9ad8,\u2005\u7518\u6cb9\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u548c\u2005DIHA\u2005\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u200591.5%\u2005\u548c\u200549.0%. \u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a,\u2005Pt-Bi\u2005\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7c92\u5f84\u4e3a\u20053.8 nm,\u2005\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u6563\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762,\u2005\u8fd9\u662f\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0.",

     "abstract": "A highly ordered TiO2/Au nanorod array was successfully fabricated by direct current electrodeposition and subsequent spin-coating. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images revealed that the TiO2 film completely covered the surface of the Au nanorods, which resulted in TiO2 shell Au core nanorods. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the TiO2 film was anatase with preferential orientation in the (101) plane. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed a shift in the absorption edge toward the visible region because of the formation of a Schottky junction between Au and TiO2. A new absorption peak that ranged from 400 to 800 nm appeared because of the localized surface plasmon resonance of the Au nanorod arrays. For the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B under UV light irradiation, the TiO2/Au nanorod array exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and its kinetic constant was 2.0 times that of pristine TiO2 and 1.3 times that of a TiO2/Au film. The enhanced photocatalysis was attributed to the high surface volume ratio, an improved UV light response, efficient separation, and the convenient migration of photogenerated charge carriers because of the one-dimensional nanorod structure and the Schottky junction between Au and TiO2. This work could provide new insights into the fabrication of a high performance photocatalyst and thus facilitate practical environmental applications.\u91c7\u7528\u7535\u6c89\u79ef\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u6d82\u819c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u2005TiO2/Au\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u68d2\u9635\u5217\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005TiO2\u2005\u8584\u819c\u5747\u5300\u5730\u5305\u8986\u5728\u2005Au\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u68d2\u7684\u8868\u9762,\u2005\u5f62\u6210\u6838\u58f3\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u9635\u5217\u7ed3\u6784.

X-ray diffraction patterns of the composites showed that the Y-fullerene/TiO2 composites contained a single and clear anatase phase. The surface properties were observed by scanning electron microscopy, which gave a characterization of the texture on the Y-fullerene/TiO2 composites and showed a homogenous distribution of titanium particles. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectra showed the presence of C and Ti with strong Y peaks. The composite obtained was also characterized with transmission electron microscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The photocatalytic results showed that the Y-fullerene/TiO2 composites had excellent activity for the degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation. This was attributed to both the effects on the photocatalysis of the supported TiO2 by charge transfer by the fullerene, and the introduction of yttrium to enhance photo-generated electron transfer.",

     "abstract": "Chemical modification is a useful method to change the properties of enzymes. Laccase is a phenol oxidase belonging to a multicopper protein, which catalyzes the oxidation of many phenolics. DeniLite IIS, a commercial laccase preparation from the Novozymes China Company, was purified by ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation. Succinic anhydride (SA) was used as a modifier for the chemical modification of the purified laccase. The effects of modification were characterized using the 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid method, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The pH stability, thermal stability, and the phenolics removal efficiency for the native and modified laccases were compared. The results showed that the average amino modification yield of the modified laccase was 85% and the modified laccase had a blue shifted ultraviolet peak and fluorescence emission peak as well as a decrease in the ultraviolet absorbance and an increase in the fluorescence intensity. Although chemical modification with SA did not change the optimum temperature for the catalysis of the laccase, it caused the optimum pH of the catalysts to shift from 4.5 to 5.5 and the enzymatic activity increased by 60%. Compared with the native laccase, the modified laccase exhibited remarkably higher pH stability and thermal stability and its catalysis efficiency (kcat) and substrate affinity (kcat/Km) increased by 53% and 122%, respectively. The phenolics removal efficiency (o-, m-, p-dihydroxybenzene) of the modified laccase increased by 48%, 57%, and 18%, respectively. These results indicate that the modified laccase with higher stability and higher efficiency is suitable for application in industrial production and for the treatment of phenolics-polluted water.\u91c7\u7528\u2005(NH4)2SO4\u2005\u5206\u6b65\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bfa\u7ef4\u4fe1\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u6f06\u9176\u5236\u5242\u2005DeniLite IIS\u2005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7eaf\u5316,\u2005\u5e76\u7528\u4e01\u4e8c\u9178\u9150\u2005(SA)\u2005\u5bf9\u7eaf\u5316\u9176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u4fee\u9970,\u2005\u8fd0\u7528\u4e09\u785d\u57fa\u82ef\u78fa\u9178\u6cd5\u3001\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u6cd5\u53ca\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4fee\u9970\u6548\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5929\u7136\u9176\u548c\u4fee\u9970\u9176\u7684\u2005pH\u2005\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u9664\u915a\u6548\u7387. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u4fee\u9970\u9176\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c28\u57fa\u4fee\u9970\u5ea6\u4e3a\u200585%,\u2005\u5176\u7d2b\u5916\u5438\u6536\u5cf0\u548c\u8367\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u5cf0\u5747\u51fa\u73b0\u84dd\u79fb,\u2005\u800c\u4e14\u7d2b\u5916\u5438\u6536\u51cf\u5c0f\u3001\u8367\u5149\u5f3a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0. \u5c3d\u7ba1\u91c7\u7528\u2005SA\u2005\u5316\u5b66\u4fee\u9970\u672a\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6f06\u9176\u7684\u6700\u9002\u53cd\u5e94\u6e29\u5ea6,\u2005\u4f46\u4f7f\u5176\u6700\u9002\u53cd\u5e94\u2005pH\u2005\u503c\u7531\u20054.5\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u20055.5,\u2005\u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u9176\u6d3b\u63d0\u9ad8\u200560%. \u4e0e\u5929\u7136\u9176\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005\u4fee\u9970\u9176\u7684\u2005pH\u2005\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u6548\u7387\u2005(kcat)\u2005\u548c\u9176\u4e0e\u5e95\u7269\u7684\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u2005(kcat/Km)\u2005\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u200553%\u2005\u548c\u2005122%,\u2005\u5bf9\u90bb\u3001\u95f4\u548c\u5bf9\u82ef\u4e8c\u915a\u7684\u9664\u915a\u6548\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u200548%,\u200557%\u2005\u548c\u200518%. \u8fd9\u9884\u793a\u7740\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fee\u9970\u6f06\u9176\u53ef\u671b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u915a\u7c7b\u6c61\u67d3\u5e9f\u6c34\u7684\u6cbb\u7406.",

     "abstract": "A solid base catalyst (K2SiO3/C) capable of microwave absorption was used for the transesterification of soybean oil under microwave radiation. The K2SiO3/C catalyst was prepared by an impregnation method that loaded K2SiO3 on carbon particles (1-3.5 mm diameter) followed by drying at 120 \u00b0C. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometry, and the Hammett indicator method. K2SiO3 was well distributed on the support. The effects of reaction variables such as catalyst loading, molar ratio of methanol to oil, and reaction time (under microwave radiation and conventional heating) were studied. When the conventionally heated reaction was carried out at 65 \u00b0C with a methanol/oil molar ratio of 30:1 and a catalyst concentration of 24 wt%, the biodiesel conversion was 96.5% after 2.5 h reaction time. The same reaction reached equilibrium after 1.5 h under microwave radiation, and the conversion of biodiesel was 96.7%.\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5c06\u94be\u6c34\u73bb\u7483\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e8e\u78b3\u9897\u7c92\u2005(\u7c92\u5f84\u20051\u20133.5\u2005mm)\u2005\u4e0a,\u2005\u7ecf\u2005120\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u70d8\u5e72\u540e\u5236\u5f97\u2005K2SiO3/C\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u4ee5\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u626b\u7784\u7535\u955c-\u80fd\u91cf\u8272\u6563\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e0e\u2005Hammett\u2005\u6307\u793a\u5242\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u4ee5\u2005K2SiO3/C\u2005\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5927\u8c46\u6cb9\u4e3a\u539f\u6599,\u2005\u8fdb\u884c\u916f\u4ea4\u6362\u53cd\u5e94\u5236\u5907\u751f\u7269\u67f4\u6cb9,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7528\u91cf\u3001\u9187/\u6cb9\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u2005(\u5fae\u6ce2\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u52a0\u70ed)\u2005\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5927\u8c46\u6cb9\u916f\u4ea4\u6362\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u5f53\u9187/\u6cb9\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u200530:1,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7528\u91cf\u200524\u2005wt%\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u4f20\u7edf\u52a0\u70ed\u53cd\u5e94\u4e8e\u20052.5\u2005h\u2005\u8fbe\u5230\u200596.5%\u2005\u916f\u4ea4\u6362\u7387,\u2005\u800c\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5fae\u6ce2\u52a0\u70ed\u53cd\u5e94\u4e8e\u20051.5\u2005h\u2005\u8fbe\u5230\u200596.7%\u2005\u916f\u4ea4\u6362\u7387.",

Hydrogen fuel can be generated by using solar energy to split water, and liquid fuels can be produced via direct CO2 photoreduction. This would create an essentially free carbon or at least carbon neutral energy cycle. In this tutorial review, the current progress in fuels' generation directly driven by solar energy is summarised.

The catalysts with a lower reduction temperature and less H2 consumption showed a higher efficiency for ozone and toluene decomposition, such as NiO/Al2O3, CoO/Al2O3, and MnO2/Al2O3, while lower efficiency were observed on Fe2O3/Al2O3 and CuO/Al2O3. Toluene decomposition efficiency was obviously dependent on ozone. Because of the low ozone to toluene concentration ratio, a CO2 yield of less than 30% was obtained. At a toluene concentration of 666 mg/m3 and an ozone concentration between 193 and 965 mg/m3, toluene conversion was found to vary from 15.2% to 46.7%. Additionally, we observed an increase in oxidation products and lattice oxygen on the catalyst surface. A preliminary investigation into the reaction pathway was undertook by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. With regards to the formation of COO\u2212, C=O, and C-O groups the high ozone concentration accelerated the transformation from COO\u2212 to C=O and C\u2013O. The substance containing COO\u2212 remained unchanged at 573 K, while the substances containing C=O and C\u2013O underwent oxidation at higher than 373 K.

The results showed that the surfactant and pH had a significant influence on the particle morphology of the BiVO4 product.

The difference in BiVO4 particle morphology led to differences in surface area, surface oxygen vacancy density, and (040) crystal plane exposure. Among the four BiVO4 samples, the rod-like sample had the highest surface area, surface oxygen vacancy density, and (040) crystal plane exposure, and the lowest bandgap energy resulting in it having the best photocatalytic activity for MO photodegradation.

The synthesized Au NPs had a uniform hexagonal morphology and their size was about 17 nm. The catalytic performance of these NPs for photodegradation of methyl orange (MeO) was investigated in aqueous solution. UV-Vis studies showed that Au NPs can catalyze photodegradation of this azo dye. The pseudo-first-order rate constants were also calculated for this reaction.",

The TiO2 powders were prepared at low temperature. As compared with rutile obtained by a conventional high temperature calcination, the rutile TiO2 prepared by the low temperature route had a smaller particle size, higher surface area, and more surface hydroxyl groups, and it gave a high photocatalytic activity. Rutile gave a faster photocatalysis reaction rate than anatase TiO2 for the same particle size and surface area. A pure brookite phase showed a lower photocatalytic activity when this was expressed in moles converted RhB per hour than the anatase and rutile phases. However, its areal photocatalytic activity expressed in moles converted RhB per hour per surface area was much higher than that of anatase and rutile TiO2.",

When higher power ultrasound was used these characteristics of the catalyst changed remarkably. The pH of the Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution decreased with an increase in high power ultrasound treatment time, which led to a weak interaction between the smaller cobalt particles and the silica support.

In all these experiments, P-TiO2 shows superior activity compared with pure TiO2 and even better activity than the commercially available P25 in most cases. By carrying out methylene blue degradation in the presence of different scavengers, \u00b7OH radicals were found to be the dominant reactive oxidizing species. The excellent performance of P-TiO2 was correlated with its pronounced ability to generate \u00b7OH radicals under illumination. We also found that P-TiO2 is extraordinarily stable against annealing. Its transformation from anatase to rutile does not occur until calcination as high as 950 \u00b0C. This phase transformation is retarded since the phosphate species on the surface of the particles acts as a barrier to grain boundary nucleation. This peculiar feature of P-TiO2 gives it reliable performance during water decontamination even after calcination at 900 \u00b0C since it retains a 100% anatase phase at this stage.",

A new alternative oxidative desulfurization process using emulsion catalysts was developed mainly by our group, is introduced in detail. Limitations because of interphase mass transfer are greatly reduced in the emulsion reaction medium. The amphiphilic emulsion catalysts can selectively oxidize the sulfur-containing molecules present in diesel to their corresponding sulfones when using H2O2 as the oxidant under mild conditions. The sulfones in the oxidized fuel oils can be removed by a polar extractant. The sulfur level of a prehydrotreated diesel can be lowered from a few hundred \u03bcg/g to 0.1 \u03bcg/g after oxidation and subsequent extraction whereas the sulfur level of a straight-run diesel can be decreased from 6000 to 30 \u03bcg/g after oxidation and extraction.\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u71c3\u6cb9\u7684\u6c27\u5316\u8131\u786b,\u2005\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e9b\u5177\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u6c27\u5316\u8131\u786b\u65b9\u6cd5,\u2005\u5982\u2005H2O2/\u6709\u673a\u9178,\u2005H2O2/\u6742\u591a\u9178,\u2005H2O2/\u542b\u949b\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u548c\u5176\u5b83\u975e\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u6c22\u4f53\u7cfb\u2005(\u5982\u53d4\u4e01\u57fa\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u7b49). \u5bf9\u672c\u8bfe\u9898\u7ec4\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4e73\u6db2\u50ac\u5316\u6c27\u5316\u8131\u786b\u4f53\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u4ecb\u7ecd. \u5728\u4e73\u6db2\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d,\u2005\u754c\u9762\u95f4\u7684\u4f20\u8d28\u9650\u5236\u88ab\u5927\u5927\u964d\u4f4e. \u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005\u53cc\u4eb2\u6027\u4e73\u6db2\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u67f4\u6cb9\u4e2d\u7684\u542b\u786b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u9009\u62e9\u6c27\u5316\u6210\u5176\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u781c\u7c7b\u5316\u5408\u7269. \u6c27\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u781c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u6781\u6027\u8403\u53d6\u5242\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u6cb9\u54c1\u4e2d\u9664\u53bb. \u7ecf\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u548c\u8403\u53d6\u4e4b\u540e,\u2005\u52a0\u6c22\u67f4\u6cb9\u4e2d\u7684\u786b\u542b\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u51e0\u767e\u2005\u03bcg/g\u2005\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u20050.1\u2005\u03bcg/g,\u2005\u800c\u76f4\u998f\u67f4\u6cb9\u4e2d\u7684\u786b\u542b\u91cf\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u20056000\u2005\u03bcg/g\u2005\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u200530\u2005\u03bcg/g.",

In the fresh state, CeO2-ZrO2 addition was found to exert little effect on NOx reduction activity using H2, CO, and NH3 as the reductants. However, after simulated road aging, NOx reduction activity was significantly impaired for the CeO2-ZrO2-free catalyst, whereas the performance of the CeO2-ZrO2-containing analog was affected to only a minor degree. These differences are explained on the basis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements showing that Pt supported on CeO2-ZrO2 remained highly dispersed after aging, whereas Pt supported on BaO/Al2O3 underwent significant sintering. In addition, the Pt/CeO2-ZrO2 component did not accumulate sulfur during aging, unlike Pt/BaO/Al2O3 for which significant sulfation of the Ba phase occurred. For both catalysts, selectivity to NH3 in NO and NO2 reduction by H2 increased after catalyst aging, indicative of a change in the relative surface coverages of N and H ad-atoms on the precious metal sites.",

HDC was 100% selective over Ni while Pd also produced cyclohexane (selectivity < 4%) as a result of a combined HDC/hydrogenation.

Additionally, the physical features of and carbon deposition on some samples after the reaction under the chosen conditions were determined by BET and X-ray diffraction as well as by carbon analyses to deduce the precursors associated with catalyst deactivation. Activity maintenance profiles of the catalysts for CO oxidation at 100\u00b0C significantly depended on the support for Co3O4 nanoparticle dispersion, the loading, the preparation technique and the calcination temperature. The best on-stream performance was achieved using a 5% Co3O4/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness method followed by calcination at 350\u00b0C. All the reaction parameters chosen here such as the reaction temperature, the feed gas composition of CO, O2, H2O and C3H8, and the gas space velocity strongly influenced the extent of catalyst deactivation during CO oxidation and also the rate of catalyst deactivation. However, the deactivation behavior is very complicated. No appreciable changes in the surface area, the porosity, and the phase of the Co3O4 nanoparticles and their size occurred even for the samples that were severely deactivated. Significant deposition of carbon on the catalysts after the reaction was visible and it depended on the reaction parameters chosen here. Consequently, this extensive parametric study on the deactivation of catalysts during oxidation and with the chosen reaction parameters and guest gases can lead to an understanding of the deactivation precursors that are associated with carbonaceous species including carbonates and surface free carbon.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative decomposition of dilute nitrobenzene in air was carried out in a catalytic plasma reactor with an inner electrode made of sintered metal fibres (SMF) that also acted as catalyst. The parameters of the concentration, specific input energy, and gas residence time were optimized. The modification of the SMF inner electrode with transition metal oxides like MnOx and CoOx oxides promoted complete oxidation, especially at low input energy. CoOx/SMF showed higher activity than MnOx/SMF and SMF, and could oxidise completely 100 ppm of nitrobenzene at 300 J/L.",

Structural characteristics and catalytic activity of the synthesized samples have been investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements. To evaluate the catalytic properties, total oxygen storage capacity and CO oxidation activity measurements were carried out. The XRD analyses revealed the formation of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 phase for CZ and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 phases for CZA samples, respectively. While the formation of only Ce0.8Tb0.2O2-\u03b4 phase was noted for both CT and CTA samples. All the supported and unsupported samples adopted a fluorite-type structure and exhibited cell parameters with respect to Vegard's rule. The HRTEM results indicated well-dispersed particles of the size around 5 nm. The RS measurements suggested the presence of oxygen vacancies due to defective structure formation. The XPS studies revealed the presence of cerium in both Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states in different proportions. It was found that CO oxidation for CTA occurs at very much lower temperature than CT, CZ, and CZA samples. Details of these findings by correlating with the structural characterization studies are consolidated.",

The yields of the main products (methane and methanol) were higher with the 254 nm lamp than with the 365 lamp while no products were observed with the 400 nm lamp. This was because the electron-hole generation rate increased with increasing energy of irradiation (decreasing wavelength) and there were higher densities of electron states at higher energies in TiO2. The increased efficiency of electron-hole generation with a shorter wavelength irradiation increased the efficiency of the catalyst. The energy of the electrons excited by visible light (400 nm) was too low for CO2 photocatalytic reduction.",

A pseudo-homogeneous one-dimensional model of an ideal plug flow reactor under an isothermal regime (450\u00b0C) was used for reactor design. A catalyst particle diameter of 3 mm is a compromise size because increasing the size of the catalyst particle leads to a decrease in the reaction rate because of an internal diffusion limitation, and particles with a smaller diameter cause a large pressure drop. A catalyst bed of 11.5 m3 was estimated for the target N2O conversion of 90% upon the treatment of 30000 m3/h of exhaust gas (0.1 mol% N2O, 0.005 mol% NO, 0.9 mol% H2O, 5 mol% O2) at 450\u00b0C and 130 kPa.",

The structure of the catalysts was characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. Toluene was chosen as a model compound to evaluate the catalytic activity in a conventional fixed-bed quartz reactor. The results indicate that Cu-Co-O was present when the Cu content was low. CuO diffraction peaks were observed when the Cu content was high. Both Co2+ and Co3+ exist on the surface of the obtained monolithic catalysts while Cu2+ is the main Cu species. The addition of a certain amount of copper oxide improved the reducibility of the cobalt oxide, which enhanced the catalytic activity of the catalysts. All the obtained catalysts showed good activity for the catalytic combustion of toluene. The Cu0.5Co0.5/Al2O3/cordierite catalyst showed the best catalytic activity.

     "abstract": "Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) ceria with mesoporous walls and cubic crystal structures were prepared with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a hard template and triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 (EO106PO70EO106), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a soft template. Citric acid was used as a complexing agent and cerium nitrate was used as a metal precursor. The 3DOM CeO2 samples were characterized by numerous analytical techniques. The as-fabricated CeO2 samples had a 3DOM architecture with polycrystalline wormhole-like mesoporous walls. The nature of the soft template had an important effect on the pore structure and the surface area of the final product. The surface areas of the F127-, CTAB-, and PEG-derived 3DOM CeO2 samples (denoted CeO2-F127, CeO2-CTAB, and CeO2-PEG, respectively) were ca. 60.5, 60.2, and 51.8 m2/g, respectively. The low-temperature reducibility of the 3DOM-structured CeO2 samples was much better than that of the bulk counterpart and the low-temperature reducibility of the three 3DOM ceria samples increased according to: CeO2-PEG < CeO2-CTAB < CeO2-F127, which coincided with the surface oxygen vacancy density sequence. The improved physicochemical properties associated with the formation of the 3DOM skeleton with wormhole-like mesoporous walls may be useful for applications such as CeO2 materials in heterogeneous catalysis.\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u4ee5\u805a\u7532\u57fa\u4e19\u70ef\u9178\u7532\u916f\u2005(PMMA)\u2005\u4e3a\u786c\u6a21\u677f,\u2005\u4e09\u5d4c\u6bb5\u5171\u805a\u7269\u2005F127\u3001\u5341\u516d\u70f7\u57fa\u4e09\u7532\u57fa\u6eb4\u5316\u94f5\u2005(CTAB)\u2005\u6216\u805a\u4e59\u4e8c\u9187\u2005(PEG)\u2005\u4e3a\u8f6f\u6a21\u677f\u5242\u2005(\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u6027\u5242),\u2005\u67e0\u6aac\u9178\u4e3a\u7edc\u5408\u5242,\u2005\u785d\u9178\u94c8\u4e3a\u91d1\u5c5e\u524d\u9a71\u4f53,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6a21\u677f\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5408\u6210\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u4ecb\u5b54\u5b54\u58c1\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6709\u5e8f\u5927\u5b54\u2005(3DOM)\u2005\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7acb\u65b9\u76f8\u2005CeO2\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u2005CeO2-F127,\u2005CeO2-CTAB\u2005\u548c\u2005CeO2-PEG,\u2005\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7269\u5316\u6027\u8d28. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u4e09\u4e2a\u6837\u54c1\u5747\u5177\u6709\u20053DOM\u2005\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8815\u866b\u72b6\u4ecb\u5b54\u5b54\u58c1,\u2005\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u6027\u5242\u7684\u79cd\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927. \u5728\u5236\u5907\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u6027\u5242\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u2005CeO2\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef,\u2005\u6240\u5f97\u2005CeO2-F127,\u2005CeO2-CTAB\u2005\u548c\u2005CeO2-PEG\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u200560.5,\u200560.2\u2005\u548c\u200551.8\u2005m2/g. \u5177\u6709\u20053DOM\u2005\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u2005CeO2\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u4f4e\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u663e\u8457\u597d\u4e8e\u65e0\u5b54\u7684\u4f53\u76f8\u2005CeO2,\u2005\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f4e\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u6309\u7167\u2005CeO2-PEG\u2005<\u2005CeO2-CTAB\u2005<\u2005CeO2-F127\u2005\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u63d0\u9ad8,\u2005\u4e0e\u5176\u8868\u9762\u6c27\u7a7a\u4f4d\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u76f8\u543b\u5408.

     "abstract": "Solving the problem of catalyst deactivation is essential in process design. To do this, various aspects of the kinetics of processes with catalyst deactivation, and their different mechanisms, are discussed. Catalyst deactivation often cannot be avoided, but more knowledge on its mechanism can help to find kinetic means to reduce its harmful consequences. When deactivation is caused by coke, the generation of coke precursors is the determining step in the deactivation kinetics. Different types of deactivation were distinguished that lead to different evolution of the process. The phenomenon of non-uniform coking can be linked to catalyst surface non-uniformity. For the class of catalysts with more than one type of active sites, an explanation was suggested for the observed trends in the deactivation modes. For catalytic processes using catalyst particles of industrial size, the influence of intraparticle diffusion resistance is important. The analysis showed that for a number of processes, the decrease of the reaction rate due to deactivation is less under diffusion control. For certain reaction mechanisms, there exist operation conditions where the rate of the process under diffusion control exceeds the rate in the kinetic control regime. A significant problem is the change of selectivity in the course of catalyst deactivation. The selectivity may either decrease or increase, and depends on the reaction mechanism during deactivation. The changes are larger when there is no diffusion resistance. The intentional poisoning of catalysts and its influence on catalyst activity and selectivity for the process of ethylene oxide production was discussed.",

     "abstract": "Various NaY zeolites modified by alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) were synthesized and used as catalysts for the dehydration of lactic acid to acrylic acid to investigate the effects of cationic species on the structure and surface acid/base distribution of the NaY zeolites. The important factors that affect their catalytic performance were also identified. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, and temperature-programmed desorption of CO2. The results show that the basic sites that are induced by modified metallic species, particularly the medium basic sites, are mainly responsible for the formation of acrylic acid. The generation of acetaldehyde was affected by the acidic sites. Among the catalysts, 2%Ba/NaY showed the highest yield of acrylic acid at up to 44.6% (38% solution, LHSV = 3 h\u22121, 325 \u00b0C) because it contained the most medium basic sites and a suitable Ba2+ cluster character.\u91c7\u7528\u78b1\u571f\u91d1\u5c5e\u2005(Mg,\u2005Ca,\u2005Sr,\u2005Ba)\u2005\u5bf9\u2005NaY\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u6027,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6c2e\u6c14\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u6c28\u6c14\u53ca\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u7269\u79cd\u5bf9\u2005NaY\u2005\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8868\u9762\u9178\u78b1\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\u7684\u5f71\u54cd,\u2005\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7504\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u7269\u79cd\u6240\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u78b1\u6027\u4f4d\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e2d\u5f3a\u78b1\u6027\u4f4d\u63a7\u5236\u7740\u4e19\u70ef\u9178\u7684\u751f\u6210,\u2005\u800c\u8868\u9762\u9178\u6027\u4f4d\u5219\u5f71\u54cd\u4e59\u919b\u7684\u751f\u6210. \u5f53\u4ee5\u94a1\u542b\u91cf\u4e3a\u20052%\u2005\u7684\u2005NaY\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5728\u4e73\u9178\u8fdb\u6599\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e3a\u200538%,\u2005\u8fdb\u6599\u7a7a\u901f\u4e3a\u20053\u2005h$ - $1\u2005\u53ca\u2005325\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005\u4e19\u70ef\u9178\u6536\u7387\u6700\u9ad8,\u2005\u4e3a\u200544.6%. \u8fd9\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e8e\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6700\u591a\u7684\u4e2d\u5f3a\u78b1\u6027\u4f4d,\u2005\u4e14\u8868\u9762\u2005Ba2+\u2005\u7c07\u5177\u6709\u5408\u9002\u7684\u2005Ba\u2013O\u2005\u952e\u957f\u53ca\u78b1\u5ea6.",

     "abstract": "The conversion of methanol was carried out over various mordenite zeolite catalysts to evaluate their catalytic performance. A post-preparation treatment of the H-MOR catalyst by halogenation with NH4Cl or NH4F and by hydrohalogenation with HCl or HF was carried out and its effect on methanol conversion reactions at 100\u2013300 \u00b0C in a continuous flow reactor was investigated. The as-synthesized H-mordenite (H-MOR) is generally more active during dimethyl ether (DME) production than the NH4-MOR and Na-MOR. Fluorinated treatment with HF or NH4F significantly improved the catalytic activity during methanol conversion and the formation of DME in comparison to chlorinated treatments with HCl or NH4Cl. This is principally attributed to the higher Si/Al ratio and an increase in the number of acid sites and their strength. Halogenation treatment with the acids of F\u2212 or Cl\u2212 gave the highest conversion activity for DME production compared to halogenation treatments with the salts of the same halogens. Zeolite dealumination by the acids was more profound than that by the halogen ion salts, which resulted in a decrease in the crystallinity and crystallite sizes of the zeolite.",

Alkaline-earth metal oxides can reduce the agglomeration of ruthenium particles at high temperatures, which increases the amount of available ruthenium. The influence of the Mg promoter on the distribution and activity of the Ru/AC catalyst were investigated by CO chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive spectrometry and by an activity test for ammonia synthesis. The results show that a specific quantity of magnesium significantly promotes the uniform distribution of Ba and Ru on the surface of AC, which enhances catalytic activity. The introduction of Mg significantly improved the size of the Ru particles and increased the Ru surface area. The distribution and interaction were improved greatly for the Ba promoter and the Ru precursor on the surface of the AC because of the addition of the Mg promoter.

This conversion equation is based on the characteristics of the power-exponential function as well as the \u201cvariable reaction order\u201d and \u201cvirtual reactant\u201d concepts. Its validity was verified by fitting experiment data from three different catalytic systems such as the dehydrogenation of diethyl benzene, the hydrogenation of ethylbenzene, and the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene. The results show that the influences of reaction temperature, pressure, residence time, and reactant composition on the conversion of the reactant can be determined within a wide range of values. By comparison with the experimental data, the calculated conversions were all found to have a total average relative deviation of less than 2%. This suggests that the conversion equation is not limited to a specific catalyst system but could be suitable for various catalyst systems in tubular reactors.\uff1a\u2005\u6839\u636e\u5e42\u6307\u51fd\u6570g(u) = ua+bu\u7684\u7279\u70b9,\u2005\u501f\u7528\u201c\u865a\u62df\u53cd\u5e94\u7ec4\u5206\u201d\u548c\u201c\u53d8\u52a8\u7ea7\u6570\u201d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5,\u2005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ba1\u5f0f\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u4e0e\u5de5\u827a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5f0f X M = 1 \u2212 exp [ \u2212 exp ( A + B / T r + C T r ) p r n p 0 + n p 1 p r \u03c4 r n \u03c4 0 + n \u03c4 1 \u03c4 r \u220f i = 1 m y i n y 0 + n y 1 y i ] . \u4e3a\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e8c\u4e59\u82ef\u50ac\u5316\u8131\u6c22\u3001\u4e59\u82ef\u52a0\u6c22\u548c\u567b\u5429\u52a0\u6c22\u8131\u786b\u7b49,\u2005\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u2005Matlab\u2005\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u50ac\u5316\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u62df\u5408. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u6b64\u65b9\u7a0b\u5728\u8f83\u5bbd\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5747\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u538b\u529b\u3001\u7a7a\u901f\u548c\u7269\u6599\u6bd4\u5bf9\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u603b\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u5dee\u5747\u5c0f\u4e8e\u20052%,\u2005\u8bf4\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u6216\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7684\u7ba1\u5f0f\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d.",

     "abstract": "Vinyl chloride selectivity during epoxidation on an atomic oxygen pre-adsorbed Ag(100) surface using density functional theory (DFT) with the periodic slab model was investigated. The reaction mechanism is a two-step process where chloroethylene oxametallacycle intermediate (OMMC) is first formed and then converted to the products. Because of the asymmetry of vinyl chloride, two competitive reaction pathways are evident. The reaction energies and the activation energies of the processes were determined by the DFT calculations. Compared with the reaction activity energy, in one pathway the formation of chloroethylene epoxide (CE) is more favorable than the formation of chloroacetaldehyde (CA) whereas in the other pathway, the formation of CA is more favorable than the formation of CE and acetyl chloride. To further understand the reason for the selectivity difference in these different paths the projected density of states of the C atom and the Ag atom involved in the OMMC was calculated.\uff1a\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5e73\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6c2f\u4e59\u70ef\u5728\u9884\u5438\u9644\u6c27\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u2005Ag(100)\u2005\u9762\u4e0a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u73af\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u8be5\u53cd\u5e94\u9996\u5148\u7531\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53,\u2005\u518d\u7531\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4ea7\u7269. \u7531\u4e8e\u6c2f\u4e59\u70ef\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u5206\u5b50,\u2005\u6240\u4ee5\u8be5\u53cd\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u9014\u5f84. \u6bd4\u8f83\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u73af\u6c27\u6c2f\u4e59\u70f7\u8981\u6bd4\u6c2f\u4e59\u919b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613; \u800c\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u53cd\u5e94\u901a\u9053\u4e2d,\u2005\u6c2f\u4e59\u919b\u8981\u6613\u4e8e\u73af\u6c27\u6c2f\u4e59\u70f7\u548c\u4e59\u9170\u6c2f\u7684\u751f\u6210. \u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u4e2d\u78b3\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u94f6\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u2005(PDOS),\u2005\u4ee5\u671f\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u5e94\u9014\u5f84\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u539f\u56e0.",

     "abstract": "The fabrication of well defined hierarchical structures of anatase TiO2 with a high percentage of reactive facets is of great importance and challenging. Hierarchically flower-like TiO2 superstructures (HFTS) self-assembled from anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets (up to 87%) were synthesized by a simple alcohothermal strategy in a HF-H2O-C2H5OH mixed solution using titanate nanotubes as precursor. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the photocatalytic oxidation decomposition of acetone in air and methyl orange in aqueous solution under UV illumination. The photocatalytic activity of HFTS was much higher than that of commercial Degussa P25 and tabular-shaped anatase TiO2 obtained using pure water as the synthesis medium. The enhancement in photocatalytic activity was related to several factors, including the hierarchically porous structure, exposed {001} facets, and increased light harvesting ability. The HFTS was also of interest for use in solar cells, photocatalytic H2 production, optoelectronic devices, sensors and catalysis.\uff1a\u2005\u4ee5\u949b\u9178\u76d0\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u4e3a\u524d\u9a71\u4f53,\u2005\u5728\u2005HF-H2O-C2H5OH\u2005\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9187\u70ed\u65b9\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u200587%\u2005\u66b4\u9732{001}\u9762\u7684\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u7247\u81ea\u7ec4\u88c5\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5206\u7b49\u7ea7\u82b1\u72b6\u2005TiO2\u2005\u8d85\u7ed3\u6784. \u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u548c\u2005N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u5728\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b\u4e8e\u7a7a\u6c14\u548c\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u4e19\u916e\u548c\u7532\u57fa\u6a59\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u7b49\u7ea7\u82b1\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u6bd4\u5546\u4e1a\u2005P25\u2005\u548c\u5728\u7eaf\u6c34\u4e2d\u5236\u5907\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7247\u72b6\u9510\u949b\u77ff\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u5149\u6d3b\u6027\u9ad8\u5f97\u591a. \u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8be5\u6837\u54c1\u5177\u6709\u5206\u7b49\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u66b4\u9732\u7684{001}\u6676\u9762\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5149\u5438\u6536\u80fd\u529b. \u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u7b49\u7ea7\u82b1\u72b6\u2005TiO2\u2005\u8d85\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u7535\u6c60\u3001\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u4ea7\u6c22\u3001\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u50ac\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f.",

     "abstract": "Polythiophene/titanium dioxide (PTh/TiO2) composite particles were synthesized via the photoinduced polymerization of thiophene in a TiO2-chloroform suspension. The resultant composite particles were characterized by BET analysis, scanning electron microscopy, laser particle size analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS). The XPS spectra indicated that a strong interaction exists between the S sites of the polymer backbone and the TiO2 particles. The UV-Vis DRS spectra showed that the resultant composite particles are responsive to visible light. The photocatalytic activities of the PTh/TiO2 composite particles were examined through the degradation processes of a rhodamine B (RhB) solution under UV irradiation and visible light irradiation. The degradation ratios of the RhB solution were found to be 76% and 98% after UV irradiation (180 min) and visible light irradiation (10 h), respectively. The photocatalysis reactive mechanisms under UV irradiation and visible light irradiation were investigated using disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA-2Na, hole scavenger) and furfuryl alcohol (radical scavenger). The oxidant from the holes and the radicals are competitive. Under UV irradiation, photogenerated holes are the main active species while under visible light irradiation the radicals are the main oxidant for the degradation of RhB.\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8bf1\u5bfc\u567b\u5429\u5728\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u6c2f\u4eff\u60ac\u6d6e\u6db2\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u805a\u567b\u5429/\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u949b\u2005(PTh/TiO2)\u2005\u590d\u5408\u7c92\u5b50,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3001\u7c92\u5f84\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u3001\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u590d\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005PTh/TiO2\u2005\u590d\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u805a\u567b\u5429\u9aa8\u67b6\u4e2d\u2005S\u2005\u539f\u5b50\u4e0e\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7c92\u5b50\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528,\u2005\u8be5\u590d\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u5177\u6709\u54cd\u5e94. \u4ee5\u7f57\u4e39\u660e\u2005B\u2005\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6c61\u67d3\u7269,\u2005\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8be5\u590d\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u5206\u522b\u4ee5\u4e59\u4e8c\u80fa\u56db\u4e59\u9178\u4e8c\u94a0\u548c\u544b\u5583\u7532\u9187\u4e3a\u7a7a\u7a74\u6355\u6349\u5242\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u6355\u6349\u5242\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u2005PTh/TiO2\u2005\u590d\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u7406. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u7a7a\u7a74\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6c27\u5316\u6027\u7269\u8d28. \u5728\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b,\u2005\u7a7a\u7a74\u8d77\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u7528; \u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b,\u2005\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u8d77\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u7528.",

     "abstract": "A Cu-SAPO-34/cordierite catalyst was prepared by in situ hydrothermal synthesis. The morphology and structure of the Cu-SAPO-34/cordierite samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and physical adsorption-desorption analyzer. The removal of NOx from simulated diesel vehicle exhaust gas was carried out using a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of C3H8, O2 concentrations, and water vapor on the activity of the catalyst were studied. The results indicate that the Cu-SAPO-34 coatings obtained by the in situ synthesis are firm and compact, and the loading amount was found to be more than 20% after one synthesis operation. The surface areas of the Cu-SAPO-34/cordierite catalysts increase greatly compared with that of cordierite. The active Cu component prepared through in situ synthesis can significantly improve the activity of selective catalytic reduction of NOx by C3H8. NOx reduction over the Cu-SAPO-34/cordierite catalyst is more than 60% between 500 and 650 \u00b0C. The NOx conversion decreases after the addition of 10% water vapor to the feed gas but the deactivation caused by water vapor is not permanent.\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u539f\u4f4d\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Cu-SAPO-34/\u5807\u9752\u77f3\u6574\u4f53\u5f0f\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u548c\u2005N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u4e19\u70f7\u8fd8\u539f\u6a21\u62df\u67f4\u6cb9\u673a\u8f66\u5c3e\u6c14\u4e2d\u2005NOx\u2005\u6027\u80fd,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e19\u70f7\u548c\u2005O2\u2005\u6d53\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u6240\u5236\u6574\u4f53\u5f0f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u2005Cu-SAPO-34\u2005\u6d82\u5c42\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u7ed3\u5408\u7262\u56fa\u7d27\u5bc6,\u2005\u7ecf\u4e00\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u2005Cu-SAPO-34\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u5927\u4e8e\u200520%,\u2005\u4e14\u5176\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u8f83\u8f7d\u4f53\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0. \u53e6\u5916,\u2005Cu\u2005\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u4e19\u70f7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u2005NOx\u2005\u7684\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u5728\u2005500 sim 650\u2005\u00b0C\u2005NOx\u2005\u6d53\u5ea6\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u200560%\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0a. \u5f53\u539f\u6599\u6c14\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u200510%\u2005\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u540e,\u2005NOx\u2005\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u6709\u6240\u964d\u4f4e,\u2005\u4f46\u505c\u52a0\u6c34\u84b8\u6c14\u540e,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d.",

     "abstract": "A series of WO3/ZnO composite photocatalysts with different WO3 concentrations were prepared by a precipitation-grinding method followed by calcination at different temperatures. The prepared samples were characterized by N2 physical adsorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of acid orange II under UV light (\u03bb = 365 nm) irradiation. The results showed that at the optimal calcination temperature of 600 \u00b0C, the WO3/ZnO composite photocatalyst with 2 wt% concentration of WO3 showed about doubled photocatalytic activity compared to pure ZnO. The increase in the photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the coupling of WO3, which suppressed the growth of ZnO particles, increase of the surface area and increased amount of surface OH groups of the sample. The presence of WO3 also restrained the recombination rate of e\u2212/h+ pairs.\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u6c89\u6dc0-\u7814\u78e8\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0d\u540c\u2005WO3\u2005\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u2005WO3/ZnO\u2005\u590d\u5408\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e94\u7528\u2005N2\u2005\u7269\u7406\u5438\u9644\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u2005\u5e76\u4ee5\u2005\u03bb\u2005=\u2005365\u2005nm\u2005\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u4e3a\u5149\u6e90,\u2005\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u9178\u6027\u6a59\u2005II\u2005\u7684\u6d3b\u6027,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u2005WO3\u2005\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5bf9\u2005WO3/ZnO\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5f53\u590d\u5408\u20052%WO3,\u2005\u5e76\u4e8e\u2005600\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u7119\u70e7\u65f6,\u2005\u6240\u5236\u5907\u7684\u2005WO3/ZnO\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u9ad8,\u2005\u6bd4\u7eaf\u2005ZnO\u2005\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea6\u4e00\u500d. \u5408\u9002\u7684\u7145\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7ed3\u6676\u5ea6,\u2005\u800c\u2005WO3\u2005\u7684\u590d\u5408\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u2005ZnO\u2005\u6676\u7c92\u7684\u957f\u5927,\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u6539\u5584\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u7f9f\u57fa\u6570\u91cf,\u2005\u5e76\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u5149\u751f\u7535\u5b50\u4e0e\u5149\u751f\u7a7a\u7a74\u7684\u590d\u5408,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u8131\u8272\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "In the NOx storage reduction (NSR) technology used to remove NOx from lean burn engines, the NOx storage material is crucial. For NiO/Al2O3 catalysts with different NiO loading prepared by coprecipitation, the maximum storage capacity for NOx occurred at a Ni/Al molar ratio of 0.3 in the catalyst. The intensity of the NiAl2O4 diffraction peak decreased with increased nickel content. When the catalysts were pretreated by a non-thermal plasma (NTP) before calcination at high temperature, the adsorption capacities for NOx increased, with an increase from 345 to 477 \u03bcmol/g on the NiO/Al2O3 catalyst with the Ni/Al molar ratio of 0.3. The metal dispersion was increased with the NTP treatment, which resulted in a high surface area. The NOx storage mechanism was discussed on the basis of DRIFTS results, which indicated that NO was first adsorbed on the surface as bridged nitrites, and then the nitrites species was transformed into different kinds of NO3\u2212 adsorbed species.\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u2005NiO\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u7684\u2005NiO/Al2O3\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u2005NOx\u2005\u50a8\u5b58\u8fd8\u539f\u6280\u672f\u53bb\u9664\u2005NOx\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5f53\u2005Ni/Al\u2005\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u4e3a\u20050.3\u2005\u65f6,\u2005NiO/Al2O3\u2005\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u2005NOx\u2005\u5438\u9644\u91cf\u6700\u5927; \u968f\u7740\u2005Ni\u2005\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0,\u2005NiAl2O4\u2005\u6676\u76f8\u51cf\u5c11. \u6c89\u6dc0\u7269\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u7145\u70e7\u524d\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6e29\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u540e,\u2005\u6240\u5f97\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5438\u9644\u2005NOx\u2005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u660e\u663e\u589e\u5f3a,\u2005\u5f53\u2005Ni/Al\u2005\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u4e3a\u20050.3\u2005\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005NOx\u2005\u5438\u9644\u91cf\u7531\u672a\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u2005345\u2005\u03bcmol/g\u2005\u589e\u81f3\u7ecf\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684\u2005477\u2005\u03bcmol/g. \u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0,\u2005\u7ecf\u4f4e\u6e29\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u540e,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u7c92\u5b50\u66f4\u52a0\u5206\u6563,\u2005\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u5927. \u53e6\u5916,\u2005\u5229\u7528\u539f\u4f4d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5438\u9644\u2005NOx\u2005\u7684\u673a\u7406. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5438\u9644\u7684\u2005NO\u2005\u9996\u5148\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u4ee5\u6865\u5f0f\u4e9a\u785d\u9178\u76d0\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728,\u2005\u7136\u540e\u8f6c\u53d8\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u785d\u9178\u76d0.",

     "abstract": "Palladium close-coupled catalysts were prepared by impregnation method with different amounts of La2O3 as a promoter. Low temperature N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO-chemisorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the effect of La2O3 on the physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts. Their catalytic activities toward C3H8 conversion were evaluated using a gas mixture that simulates the emissions from a gasoline engine. The results of catalytic activity indicate that the presence of La2O3 significantly improves catalytic performance and enhances the thermal resistance of the catalysts. H2-TPR results suggest that the addition of La2O3 increases the reductive ability of the catalysts and shifts the reduction temperature to a lower value. The XPS and CO-chemisorption results indicate that doping by La2O3 also improves the dispersion of the Pd species and decreases the mean particle size of palladium. The optimal loading amount of La2O3 is 10%.\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u2005La2O3\u2005\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u2005Pd\u2005\u5bc6\u5076\u50ac\u5316\u5242. \u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6e29\u2005N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001H2\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u3001CO\u2005\u5316\u5b66\u5438\u9644\u548c\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u2005La2O3\u2005\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u6a21\u62df\u6c7d\u8f66\u5c3e\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u4e19\u70f7\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u6d3b\u6027. \u6d3b\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005La2O3\u2005\u7684\u6dfb\u52a0\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5bf9\u4e19\u70f7\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027.

     "abstract": "The combination of TiO2 nanotubes and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) photocatalyst used their large adsorption capacity and wide visible light response, respectively, and a synergistic effect to enhance photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. Anatase TiO2 nanotubes were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis, a hydrogen peroxide treatment, and calcination at 400 \u00b0C. AgCl nanoparticles were then loaded onto the TiO2 nanotubes by a precipitation reaction, and some of the AgCl particles were reduced to Ag particles under halogen tungsten lamp irradiation. This gave a visible light SPR photocatalyst of Ag@AgCl/TiO2 nanotubes that exhibited high photocatalytic activity, which was due to its large adsorption capacity, wide visible light response due to the SPR effect, fast separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and strong oxidizing ability of Cl0 generated by combining Cl\u2212 ions with photoexcited holes. Methylene blue dye was thoroughly decolorized within 1 h in the presence of this photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.

     "abstract": "Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) modified using TiO2 nanoparticles (CNT@TiO2) were prepared. Then, Pt-Au/CNT@TiO2 catalysts were prepared by a deposition-UV-photoreduction method for direct methanol fuel cells. The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalytic performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Pt-Au nanoparticles were found to be uniformly deposited onto the CNT@TiO2 support and had diameters of 2\u20133 nm. Compared with the Pt-Au/CNT catalyst that was made using a general chemical method, Pt-Au/CNT@TiO2 exhibits higher CO-tolerance for the following reasons. Firstly, the strong interaction between the Pt-Au alloy and TiO2 leads to an increase in electron density on the metallic Pt-Au, which transfers electrons to the \u03d5 $CO* orbital of CO and weakens C\u2013O binding while the oxidation overpotential is lowered. Secondly, the high-valence Ti ions dissociate water to form OHad (ad: adsorbed) species, which then reacts with the strongly bound COad on the Pt surface to form CO2.\uff1a\u2005\u4ee5\u2005TiO2\u2005\u5305\u8986\u7684\u591a\u58c1\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u2005(CNT@TiO2)\u2005\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53,\u2005Pt\u2005\u548c\u2005Au\u2005\u4e3a\u6d3b\u6027\u7269\u8d28,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u6c89\u79ef\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u51fa\u9ad8\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u7532\u9187\u9633\u6781\u7535\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u2005Pt-Au/CNT@TiO2,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u548c\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u7269\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81. \u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6297\u6bd2\u6027\u80fd\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u4f0f\u5b89\u548c\u4ea4\u6d41\u963b\u6297\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u7c92\u5f84\u4e3a\u20052\u223c3\u2005nm\u7684\u2005Pt-Au\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5728\u2005CNT@TiO2\u2005\u8f7d\u4f53\u4e0a. \u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u5316\u5b66\u8fd8\u539f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u7684\u2005Pt-Au/CNT\u2005\u7535\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005Pt-Au/CNT@TiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6297\u6bd2\u6027. \u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a: (1)\u2005Pt-Au\u2005\u5408\u91d1\u548c\u2005TiO2\u2005\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f7f\u2005Pt-Au\u2005\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0,\u2005Pt-Au\u2005\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u4f20\u9012\u90e8\u5206\u7535\u5b50\u5230\u2005CO\u2005\u7684\u53cd\u952e\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u524a\u5f31\u78b3\u6c27\u952e,\u2005\u6700\u7ec8\u4fc3\u4f7f\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u7535\u4f4d\u964d\u4f4e; (2)\u2005\u9ad8\u4ef7\u6001\u7684\u949b\u79bb\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u5438\u9644\u6001\u7684\u2005OHad\u2005\u7269\u79cd,\u2005\u6b64\u7269\u79cd\u4e0e\u5438\u9644\u5728\u2005Pt\u2005\u8868\u9762\u7684\u2005CO\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u6700\u7ec8\u751f\u6210\u2005CO2.",

     "abstract": "Pt catalysts supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon were prepared by the NaBH4 reduction of H2PtCl6 in the presence of a carbon support. One of the catalysts was deliberately treated with H2O2 after chemical reduction to alter the oxidation state of Pt and to promote methanol oxidation through more efficient water dissociation on the Pt sites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that H2O2 treatment resulted in a more oxidized Pt catalyst. The electrooxidation of methanol over treated and untreated Pt catalysts in acidic solutions at room temperature was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Despite their design, the more oxidized Pt catalysts could not supply active oxygen capable of removing the reaction-inhibiting CO-like reaction intermediates.

In this work, the role of carbon materials in heterogeneous catalysis is assessed and publications on methane decomposition and CO2 reforming of methane over carbon materials are reviewed. The influence of textural properties (BET surface area and micropore volume, etc.) and oxygen surface groups on the catalytic activity of carbon materials are discussed. In addition, this review examines how activated carbon and carbon black catalysts, which are the most commonly used carbon catalysts, are deactivated. Characteristics of the carbon deposits from methane are discussed and the influence of the reactivity to CO2 of fresh carbon and carbonaceous deposits for high and steady conversion during CO2 reforming of CH4 are also considered.",

The iron species in the prepared catalyst was Fe3O4 because of the partial reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) on the surface of CMK-3. The high catalytic activity of the catalyst arises from the formation of Fe3O4 on the surface of CMK-3 and the high selectivity for phenol is attributed to the consumption of excess hydroxyl radicals by CMK-3. The effect of temperature, reaction time, volume of H2O2, and amount of catalyst on the catalytic performance of the prepared catalyst were investigated. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol and 18% benzene conversion was achieved with 92% selectivity for phenol and with a TOF value of 8.7 h\u22121. The stability of catalyst was investigated by determining its activity after the fourth run and it was found to have decreased to 80% of the fresh catalyst's activity.",

The thermal genesis of the different catalysts from their precursors was explored using thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis, and X-ray diffraction. Texture analysis was carried out using N2 adsorption at \u2212196 \u00b0C. We found that all the catalysts that were calcined at 500 \u00b0C have a spinel structure. N2O decomposition activity was found to increase with an increase in the spinel structure's magnesium content. The influence of alkali cation promoters (Li, Na, K, and Cs) on the activity of the most active catalyst in the MgxCo1-xCo2O4 series, i.e. MgCo2O4, was also investigated. The sequence of the promotional effect was found to be: un-promoted < Li < Na < Cs < K-promoted catalyst. The reason for the increase in activity for the added alkali cations was electronic in nature. Additionally, the dependence of the activity on the K/Co ratio was also determined. The highest activity was obtained for the catalyst with a K/Co ratio of 0.05. A continuous decrease in activity was obtained for higher K/Co ratios. This decrease in activity was attributed to the elimination of mesoporosity in the catalysts with K/Co ratios > 0.05, based on N2 adsorption and scanning electron microscopy results.",

The Ni particle size was estimated from XRD patterns and TEM graphs. The agglomeration of nickel particle and the poison by sulfur components were recognized as the main reasons in deactivation of Arak and Razi catalysts, respectively. The activity of the used catalysts before and after regeneration was measured on methane steam reforming at a CH4:H2O ratio of 1:3 at 850 \u00b0C. The regeneration processes for Arak and Razi samples were performed with CO2 as an oxidative atmosphere and steam as a regenerating agent, respectively. The results show that, (1) no residual sulfur components were on the regenerated Razi catalyst surface without changing the structure of the catalyst and the regenerated catalyst has gained 80% of its catalytic activity, and that (2) the nickel particle size of regenerated Arak specimen decreased remarkably as measured by Debye-Scherrer equation from XRD patterns. TEM images were in agreement with the XRD results and indicated a decrease in nickel particle size of regenerated catalyst.

The effects of factors such as substrate concentration, catalyst concentration, partial pressure of hydrogen and temperature on initial rate of reaction of selected olefins were investigated. A mechanism for the reaction was proposed from the rate equation. The effects of the solvent and structure of the olefin on the rate of hydrogenation were investigated. The catalyst showed good reusability without any leaching of metal from the support. The homologous analog of the polymer-supported catalyst could not be used as catalyst for the hydrogenation of olefins in methanol because there was precipitation of the metal during reaction.",

     "abstract": "Precious metal nanomaterials have shown significantly different reactivity and catalytic activity because of their small-size effects. In this report, we focused on gold nanoparticle-based catalysts, especially gold nanoparticle surface-bound catalysts, their preparation and application. Because of its special surface properties, gold can form stable bonds with sulfur containing molecules including sulfides and thiols. These molecules form well ordered self-assembled monolayers on gold nanoparticles, which render monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles (MPGs) with good solubility, easy characterization, extraordinary stability, and versatility. With attached functional groups, we used MPGs as surface-bound catalysts. These catalysts show the combined characteristics of a homogeneous and a heterogeneous catalyst, which is critical for theoretical aspects and in the development of new types of surface-bound catalysts.\uff1a\u8d35\u91d1\u5c5e\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u2005Au\u2005\u7c92\u5b50\u8868\u9762\u914d\u4f4d\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528. \u7531\u4e8e\u2005Au\u2005\u53ef\u4e0e\u786b\u5316\u7269\u5f62\u6210\u914d\u4f4d\u952e,\u2005\u6240\u4ee5\u786b\u5316\u7269\u53ef\u5728\u2005Au\u2005\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u5e8f\u5355\u5206\u5b50\u819c. \u5355\u5206\u5b50\u819c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u2005Au\u2005\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u6eb6\u89e3\u6027\u3001\u5206\u6563\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027,\u2005\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u9762\u529f\u80fd\u56e2\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd. \u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u4f53\u7cfb\u517c\u5177\u5747\u76f8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u548c\u591a\u76f8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u7279\u70b9,\u2005\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49.",

Co-impregnation gave a better catalyst for the preferential CO oxidation in H2 (PROX) reaction. Microcalorimetry data showed that the adsorption of CO and H2 were different. Quasi in situ M\u00f6ssbauer data of the three catalysts after reduction, reoxidation, and PROX reaction showed that a strong interaction between Ir and Fe affected the redox properties of the Ir-Fe catalysts. CO conversion was proportional to the concentration of the Fe2+(a) species, thus, Fe2+(a) was an active site in the PROX reaction. The impregnation sequence influenced the interaction between Ir and Fe and consequently, the amount of the active Fe2+(a) species.

During an anodic potential sweep, the electro-oxidation of saccharose on Cu occurred by the formation of CuIII and this reaction also occurred in the early stages of the reversed cycle until it is stopped by the negative potentials. A mechanism based on the electro-chemical generation of CuIII active sites and their subsequent consumption by saccharose was proposed, and the rate law and kinetic parameters were obtained. The charge transfer resistance from theoretical and impedance studies was used to verify the mechanism. Under chronoamperometry regimes, the reaction followed Cottrellian behavior.

The rate determining barrier was that for electrophilic aromatic substitution (122.4 kJ/mol), while the subsequent C-S bond dissociation has a lower barrier (75.5 kJ/mol).\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u2005ONIOM\u2005\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e0a\u567b\u5429\u7684\u88c2\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u9aa8\u67b6\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5404\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6784\u578b\u3001\u7535\u8377\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u53ca\u6574\u4e2a\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u2005B3LYP\u2005\u548c\u2005M05-2X\u2005\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u9aa8\u67b6\u53ef\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cd\u5e94\u5e26\u7535\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53,\u2005\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5438\u9644\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5206\u79bb,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e. \u4e0e\u73b0\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u2005B3LYP\u2005\u6cdb\u51fd\u76f8\u6bd4,\u2005\u6700\u8fd1\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u2005M05-2X\u2005\u6cdb\u51fd\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528,\u2005\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u4e5f\u66f4\u4e3a\u5408\u7406. \u6574\u4e2a\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u51b3\u901f\u6b65\u662f\u4eb2\u7535\u53d6\u4ee3\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u5176\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u4e3a\u2005122.4\u2005kJ/mol,\u2005\u968f\u540e\u7684\u2005C\u2013S\u2005\u952e\u89e3\u79bb\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u8f83\u4f4e,\u2005\u4e3a\u200575.5\u2005kJ/mol.",

     "abstract": "Limonoid bitterness is a serious problem in the citrus industry worldwide. Limonoid glucosyltransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of bitter limonoid into non-bitter limonoid glucoside while retaining the health benefit of limonoids in the juice. The immobilization of this enzyme in a column can solve the juice bitterness problem. More information about the catalytic residues of the enzyme is needed in this immobilization process. Glutamate/aspartate, histidine, lysine, tryptophan, serine, and cysteine residues were chemically modified to investigate their roles in the catalytic function of limonoid glucosyltransferase. Inactivation of the enzyme following modification of carboxyl and imidazole moieties was a consequence of a loss in substrate binding and catalysis in the glucosyltransfer reaction. The modification of a single histidine residue completely destroyed the ability of limonoid glucosyltransferase to transfer the D-glucopyranosyl unit. Tryptophan seemed to have some role in maintaining the active conformation of the catalytic site. Lysine also seemed to have some direct or indirect role in this catalysis but the modification of serine and cysteine did not have any effect on catalysis. Therefore, we conclude that the carboxyl and imidazole groups containing amino acids are responsible for the catalytic action of the enzyme.",

     "abstract": "The selective catalytic reduction of NO in excess O2 by CH4 was investigated over a series of ZSM-5-supported manganese catalysts (Mn/ZSM-5). The catalytic activity depended on preparation method and Mn loading. An ion exchange method resulted in a higher activity than an impregnation method. Catalytic activity increased with increasing Mn loading until a Mn loading of 2.06% that gave a maximum NO conversion of 57.3%. H2 temperature-programmed reduction results showed that the ion exchange method and low Mn loadings (\u2264 2.06%) restricted the formation of non-stoichiometric MnOx (1.5 < x < 2) species that have higher oxidative activity, and thus suppressed the combustion of CH4 by O2, which increased the selectivity for NO reduction. In a SO2 containing stream, a substantial decrease in NO conversion was seen at \u2264 550 \u00b0C but not at \u2265 600 \u00b0C. SO2 temperature-programmed surface reaction and NO temperature-programmed desorption demonstrated that sulfur species were formed at temperature \u2264 550 \u00b0C, and these covered active sites and decreased the catalytic activity. The sulfur species desorbed at \u2265 600 \u00b0C, thus the addition of SO2 did not have a significant impact on the catalytic activity.\uff1a\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5bcc\u6c27\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u2005Mn/ZSM-5\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u2005CH4\u2005\u9009\u62e9\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u2005NO\u2005\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u2005H2\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u3001SO2\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8868\u9762\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u2005NO\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u2005Mn\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173. \u79bb\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u7684\u2005Mn/ZSM-5\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242; NO\u2005\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u968f\u7740\u2005Mn\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0,\u2005\u81f3\u20052.06%\u2005\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u503c\u2005(57.3%),\u2005\u7136\u540e\u968f\u7740\u2005Mn\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u964d\u4f4e. \u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u6cd5\u6216\u8f83\u4f4e\u2005Mn\u2005\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u2005(\u2264\u20052.06%)\u2005\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u975e\u5316\u5b66\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u2005MnOx\u2005(1.5\u2005<\u2005x\u2005<\u20052)\u2005\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u5f62\u6210,\u2005\u51cf\u7f13\u4e86\u2005CH4\u2005\u7684\u6c27\u5316\u71c3\u70e7\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u56e0\u800c\u2005CH4\u2005\u8fd8\u539f\u2005NO\u2005\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8. \u5728\u542b\u2005SO2\u2005\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d,\u2005Mn/ZSM-5\u2005\u6d3b\u6027\u5728\u2005550\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65f6\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d,\u2005\u4f46\u5728\u2005600\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0a\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd. \u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u2005550\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65f6\u2005SO2\u2005\u5728\u2005Mn/ZSM-5\u2005\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5438\u9644\u786b\u7269\u79cd,\u2005\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4d,\u2005\u5bfc\u81f4\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u964d\u4f4e; \u800c\u5728\u2005600\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u4ee5\u4e0a\u65f6\u542b\u786b\u7269\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u8131\u9644\u5b8c\u5168,\u2005\u56e0\u800c\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927.",

The results show that Ni/SiO2 catalysts with smaller Ni particle size exhibit higher catalytic activity and improved resistance to carbon deposition. The conversion of methane and carbon dioxide was 75.5% and 72.6%, respectively, for the methane-propane autothermal reforming reaction. The propane dissociates and is oxidized more easily than methane. The CHx intermediate species from propane dissociation combines with the adsorbed hydrogen to produce methane, which results in a decrease in the apparent conversion of methane. Additionally, H2 and CO are generated by the reaction with adsorbed CO2, which promotes the conversion of CO2.\uff1a\u5728\u6d41\u5316\u5e8a\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e2d,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u2005Ni/SiO2\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u2005CH4\u2005\u6216 CH4-C3H8\u2005\u4e34\u6c27\u2005CO2\u2005\u91cd\u6574\u2005(\u81ea\u70ed\u91cd\u6574)\u2005\u5236\u5408\u6210\u6c14\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u2005CH4-C3H8\u2005\u6df7\u5408\u6c14\u81ea\u70ed\u91cd\u6574\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d,\u2005Ni\u2005\u7c92\u5f84\u8f83\u5c0f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6297\u79ef\u70ad\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u9ad8,\u2005CH4\u2005\u548c\u2005CO2\u2005\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u200575.5%\u2005\u548c\u200572.6%.

The metal nano-sol was prepared by the chemical reduction of its precursor by the micellar technique in the presence of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), and the micelle stabilized metal particles were intercalated in the clay mineral by ion exchange. TEM micrographs of the catalyst particles showed that the metal particles were in the nanometre range. The average diameters of the particles were 1-25 nm. The effects of temperature, metal loading, and hydrogen flow rate on the catalytic activity and selectivity for \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated alcohol were studied. The results were correlated with the structural properties of the catalysts. The products formed in each reaction over the different catalysts showed that the catalysts were very active for hydrogenation, and the selectivity for the desired product, namely, \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated alcohol, was good. The metal catalysts intercalated in montmorillonite showed better selectivity than that in hectorite because of its higher acidity. Increased selectivity for \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated alcohol was observed with increased flow rate of hydrogen.",

Pt primarily enhances toluene conversion, total xylenes production, and p-xylene relative to its thermodynamic equilibrium. As the concentration of HF increases from 1.0% to 3.0%, the catalyst activity increases because of the increase in the number of acid sites and their strength. Additionally, the surface area and Pt dispersion also increases. An advantage of increased HF doping is that the formation of voluminous trimethylbenzene (TMB) byproducts is inhibited. However, at a HF concentration of 4.0%, Al and Si are partially leached and then deposited mostly in the wider catalytic pores. This was determined by evaluating the pore volume distribution and we determined that reactivity inhibition was obviously present and was due to diffusion restriction.",

The results show that TOLs have a higher degradation efficiency than pure TiO2 and TiO2-loaded lava composites (TLLs) because of the high adsorption capacity of MB and the small crystalline size of the TiO2 particles in addition to a synergetic effect for adsorption and photocatalytic degradation. The optimum conditions were a MB concentration of 1.5 mg/L at pH 8 with a TOLs concentration of 6.8 mg/L for the fastest MB degradation. Additionally, the used TOLs retained high activity for MB photocatalytic degradation.\uff1a\u2005\u4ee5\u949b\u9178\u4e01\u916f\u4e3a\u524d\u9a71\u4f53,\u2005\u5c01\u5835\u7684\u706b\u5c71\u5ca9\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53,\u2005\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u4e34\u754c\u2005CO2\u2005\u8f85\u52a9\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005TiO2\u2005\u5916\u8d1f\u8f7d\u706b\u5c71\u5ca9\u590d\u5408\u4f53,\u2005\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u4e9a\u7532\u57fa\u84dd\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u6eb6\u6db2\u2005pH\u2005\u503c\u53ca\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d53\u5ea6\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005TiO2\u2005\u5916\u8d1f\u8f7d\u706b\u5c71\u5ca9\u590d\u5408\u4f53\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u2005TiO2\u2005\u548c\u2005TiO2\u2005\u4f53\u8d1f\u8f7d\u706b\u5c71\u5ca9\u590d\u5408\u4f53. \u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5916\u8d1f\u8f7d\u590d\u5408\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e9a\u7532\u57fa\u84dd\u7684\u9ad8\u5438\u9644\u6027\u3001\u5c0f\u6676\u7c92\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u2005TiO2\u2005\u9897\u7c92\u4ee5\u53ca\u5438\u9644\u548c\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u964d\u89e3\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94. \u4e9a\u7532\u57fa\u84dd\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e3a\u20051.5\u2005mg/L,\u2005\u6eb6\u6db2\u2005pH\u2005\u4e3a\u20058,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e3a\u20056.8\u2005mg/L\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u5916\u8d1f\u8f7d\u2005TiO2\u2005\u706b\u5c71\u5ca9\u590d\u5408\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e9a\u7532\u57fa\u84dd\u964d\u89e3\u901f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8,\u2005\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7684\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027.",

The results show that the NO catalytic oxidation process is accompanied by a significant adsorption of NO2 and it exhibits a dynamic equilibrium between NO2 adsorption and the reaction of NO. TPSR and in situ DRIFTS characterization of the adsorbed NOx species revealed that adsorbed NO3 formed on the surface of the Na-ZSM-5 molecular sieve as a result of the reaction between adsorbed NO and gaseous O2. The oxidation of NO3 with NO produced weakly-adsorbing NO2 and N2O4 which were released once the adsorption reached saturation.

The ambition is to keep the essential advantages of solids as catalysts, in particular robustness, easy separation from products, and tolerance to high temperatures, while adding the advantages typical of enzymes, like more activity, allostery, and more precise control of selectivity, in particular enantioselectivity.

     "abstract": "Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with fish-bone graphene alignment and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used to support ruthenium for ammonia decomposition. The Ru nanoparticles on the CNF supports are more active than those on CNT supports. The Ru particle size was adjusted by changing the Ru loading or by introducing oxygen containing groups onto the CNF surface. The site activity increases when the Ru crystal size increases. The oxygen groups on the CNFs have a remarkable effect on ammonia decomposition over the Ru nanoparticles. On identically sized Ru crystals, oxygen on the CNFs clearly enhances ammonia decomposition over the Ru/CNFs.",

Al2O3 was highly dispersed in Al2O3-HZSM-5 after impregnation (Al2O3-HZSM-5-IM), while a layered Al2O3-covered HZSM-5 structure solid acid was synthesized via chemical precipitation (Al2O3-HZSM-5-CP). Both the combined Al2O3-HZSM-5 solid acids prepared by impregnation and chemical precipitation have a higher surface area and more meso- and macropores.

The structural and textural characterization of these catalysts was done using N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, and temperature-programmed reduction. These catalysts were found to be effective for the dehydrogenation reaction and the 6%V/MCF catalyst showed the highest activity. The MCF-supported vanadia catalysts exhibited far higher activity than their conventional V/MCM-41 counterparts, which can be attributed to the higher reducibility and better diffusion of reactants and products in the former catalysts. A higher conversion was obtained during EB dehydrogenation with CO2 than with N2. This is due to the oxidative dehydrogenation of EB with the help of oxygen that originates from CO2 as well as the coupling of EB simple dehydrogenation with the reverse water-gas shift reaction.",

The permeation of all components in the reaction mixture and their non-ideal thermodynamic behavior were taken into account. The esterification of acetic acid with n-butanol for the production of n-butyl acetate integrated with a poly(vinyl alcohol) pervaporation membrane was selected as the model system for this study. The validity of the model was tested by comparing the calculated results with experimental data reported in the literature. The results show that the esterification is facilitated by water removal using pervaporation, which accelerates the rate of ester formation. A parametric study was carried out to evaluate the effects of operating conditions on the performance of the pervaporation-coupled esterification reactor and this included temperature, initial composition of the reactants, membrane area relative to the reactor's size, and catalyst concentration. Based on these results, suitable operating conditions for the membrane-integrated reaction process are discussed.",

The composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The catalytic activity of LaMn0.8Mg0.2O3 toward methane combustion was evaluated. The results show that the different preparation methods and calcination temperatures greatly influence the textural structure, crystallite size, and different oxygen species within the LaMn0.8Mg0.2O3 perovskite material. The perovskite catalyst synthesized by the glycine-nitrate method and calcined at 700 \u00b0C shows the best activity for methane combustion among the tested materials. Its T50 (the reaction temperature at which 50% CH4 is converted) is only \u223c440 \u00b0C. This good catalyst performance can be attributed to the small crystallite size (12.4 nm), larger surface area (18.6 m2/g), and high concentration of surface Mn4+ cations, which creates more flexible and reactive surface oxygen species.",

The catalytic stability of HMOR was improved significantly by pyridine pre-adsorption, and a yield of methyl acetate \u223c30% was still obtained after 48 h on stream at 473 K. In situ infrared spectroscopy and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption revealed that pyridine preferentially occupied the acidic sites in 12-membered ring pores but not the acidic sites in 8-membered ring pores. 129Xe NMR studies suggested that the channels of HMOR were blocked by coke in the reaction but those in the pyridine-modified HMOR were not. The acidic sites in the 12-membered ring pores were responsible for the deactivation of HMOR, and the reaction can be directed to occur mainly on the acidic sties in the 8-membered ring pores by the selective adsorption of pyridine in the 12-membered ring pores.\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7532\u919a\u5728\u6c22\u578b\u4e1d\u5149\u6cb8\u77f3\u548c\u5421\u5576\u4fee\u9970\u7684\u6c22\u578b\u4e1d\u5149\u6cb8\u77f3\u4e0a\u7684\u4e8c\u7532\u919a\u7fb0\u57fa\u5316\u53cd\u5e94. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5421\u5576\u9884\u5438\u9644\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e8c\u7532\u919a\u7fb0\u57fa\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027,\u2005\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u2005473\u2005K\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u200548\u2005h\u2005\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u7ea6\u200530%\u2005\u7684\u4e59\u9178\u7532\u916f\u6536\u7387. \u539f\u4f4d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u2005NH3\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8131\u9644\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0,\u5421\u5576\u5438\u9644\u5728\u200512\u2005\u5143\u73af\u5185,\u2005\u800c\u20058\u2005\u5143\u73af\u5185\u7684\u9178\u6027\u4f4d\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d7\u5e72\u6270. 129Xe\u2005\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u672a\u7ecf\u4fee\u9970\u7684\u4e1d\u5149\u6cb8\u77f3\u53cd\u5e94\u540e\u5b54\u9053\u4e25\u91cd\u5835\u585e,\u2005\u800c\u5421\u5576\u4fee\u9970\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u53cd\u5e94\u540e\u5b54\u9053\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8. \u56e0\u6b64,\u200512\u2005\u5143\u73af\u5185\u9178\u6027\u4f4d\u662f\u79ef\u70ad\u5931\u6d3b\u4f4d,\u2005\u5421\u5576\u5438\u9644\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u200512\u2005\u5143\u73af\u5185\u79ef\u70ad\u7684\u751f\u6210,\u2005\u4e8c\u7532\u919a\u7fb0\u57fa\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u20058\u2005\u5143\u73af\u5185\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4d\u4e0a\u987a\u5229\u8fdb\u884c.",

The product distribution depends on the reaction temperature, number of acid sites, and the Br\u00f6nsted to Lewis sites ratios. A lower molar ratio of reactants (TBA/phenol = 2) and a higher space velocity facilitated the production of 4-tert-butyl phenol. The influence of various parameters such as temperature, reactant feed molar ratio, feed rate, and time on stream were investigated for conversion yield and product selectivity.",

It has all the features of a large specific surface area with a mesoporous architecture, pore wall of high crystallinity and high thermostability. Nanoparticles of noble metals in this mesoporous structured titania are stable.

Their acidity and catalytic activity for phenylhydroxylamine (PHA) rearrangement in the synthesis of p-aminophenol (PAP) from nitrobenzene were studied. The incorporation of Si in the samples prepared in the presence of HF was mainly by the SM3 mechanism and patches of Si(4Si) were predominant. This resulted in a decrease in the acid amount and increase in acid strength. The presence of HF during synthesis increased the integrity of the SAPO-5 crystal and helped incorporate more Si in the SAPO-5 structure by inhibiting the polymerization of Si species to a reticulated silica gel.

     "abstract": "The pre-reforming of commercial liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) over Ni-based catalysts at a low steam to carbon molar ratio was investigated. Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnating boehmite with an aqueous solution of cerium and nickel nitrates. These catalysts were found to be highly efficient in LPG pre-reforming at 300\u2013400\u00b0C and a low molar ratio of steam to carbon of 1.0. The effect of nickel content and reaction temperature on the performance of the Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts was evaluated and the 15%Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst was selected for a stability test in the pre-reforming of LPG. The results showed that the conversion of LPG and the composition of the products in the exit gas were almost unchanged for the steam reforming of commercial LPG after about 105 h of reaction time on stream at 350\u00b0C and GHSV of the inlet gas of 3\u223c000 ml/(g\u00b7h) with a steam to carbon molar ratio of 1.0, indicating that the catalyst exhibited excellent stability. After the reaction, no obvious carbon was observed on the catalyst surface. Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts show good catalytic performance for the low temperature steam reforming of LPG, which may potentially be used in commercial fuel cells.\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u785d\u9178\u954d\u548c\u785d\u9178\u94c8\u6c34\u6eb6\u6db2\u5171\u6d78\u6e0d\u8584\u6c34\u94dd\u77f3\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Ni/CeO2/Al2O3\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6c34\u78b3\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5546\u7528\u6db2\u5316\u77f3\u6cb9\u6c14\u2005(LPG)\u2005\u9884\u91cd\u6574\u53cd\u5e94. \u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u2005Ni\u2005\u542b\u91cf\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6e29\u5ea6\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u2005300\u223c400\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u548c\u6c34\u78b3\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u4e3a\u20051.0\u2005\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u2005LPG\u2005\u9884\u91cd\u6574\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027. 15%Ni/CeO2/Al2O3\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u2005350\u2005\u00b0C,\u20053\u00a0000\u2005ml/(g\u00b7h)\u2005\u548c\u6c34\u78b3\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u20051.0\u2005\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u2005105\u2005h\u2005\u540e\u2005LPG\u2005\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u548c\u4ea7\u6c14\u7ec4\u6210\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8,\u2005\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027. \u53cd\u5e94\u540e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u79ef\u70ad.",

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, 27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, N2 adsorption, and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurement. There was a strong intergrowth interaction between CeO2 and \u03b3-Al2O3 oxide crystallites during the synthesis, which influenced the microstructure and crystal growth of the two coexisting oxides and resulted in a high hydrothermal stability for \u03b3-Al2O3. The OSC per unit mass of the Ce-Al-O system was 2\u20133 times higher than that of a single phase CeO2 with a nanocrystalline structure even after hydrothermal treatment at a high temperature. With a mechanical mixture, this improved OSC was not observed because there was no oxide crystallite intergrowth.\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u67e0\u6aac\u9178\u7edc\u5408\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u2005Ce-Al-O\u2005\u4e24\u76f8\u6c27\u5316\u7269,\u2005\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u300127Al\u2005\u9b54\u89d2\u6838\u78c1\u3001N2\u2005\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u548c\u50a8\u6c27\u91cf\u6d4b\u5b9a\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u4e24\u76f8\u5171\u751f\u65f6\u2005CeO2\u2005\u548c\u2005\u03b3-Al2O3\u2005\u95f4\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528,\u2005\u76f8\u4e92\u8c03\u53d8\u4e86\u5f7c\u6b64\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u4e24\u7269\u76f8\u6676\u7c92\u7684\u957f\u5927,\u2005\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u2005\u03b3-Al2O3\u2005\u7684\u9ad8\u6e29\u6c34\u70ed\u8001\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027,\u2005\u5e76\u4f7f\u2005Ce-Al-O\u2005\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e24\u76f8\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u7684\u50a8\u6c27\u80fd\u529b\u6bd4\u5355\u76f8\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u2005CeO2\u2005\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u20052\u223c3\u2005\u500d,\u2005\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u540e\u6837\u54c1\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u50a8\u6c27\u6027\u80fd.",

     "abstract": "The decomposition of hydroperoxide in the presence of a metalloporphyrin is an important metalloporphyrin-catalyzed hydrocarbon aerobic oxidation reaction. This process affects the oxidation product selectivity, the formation rate of oxidation products, and also the life of the metalloporphyrin catalysts. The decomposition of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) catalyzed by tetra-(p-chlorophenyl) porphyrinatomanganese chloride (T(p-Cl)PPMnIIICl) was studied by EPR, and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was used as an EPR spin trap. Experiments revealed that only the cumoxyl radical adduct was present during the initial reaction time at 25\u00b0C. Another kind of radical adduct, a rearrangement product of the cumylperoxyl radical spin adduct, was also detected by EPR when the concentration of CHP was increased. Results further show that CHP decomposition started by homolytic O\u2013O bond cleavage because of the T(p-Cl)PPMnIIICl catalyst generating cumoxyl radicals in the initial part of the reaction and this led to 2-phenyl-2-propanol. The cumylperoxyl radicals were formed from the subsequent reaction of cumoxyl radicals with CHP when the initial CHP concentration increased. A free radical route for this decomposition reaction was also proposed.\uff1a\u4ee5\u20055,5-\u4e8c\u7532\u57fa-1-\u5421\u54af\u5549-N-\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u2005(DMPO)\u2005\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u6355\u6349\u5242,\u2005\u91c7\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u987a\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6ce2\u8c31\u2005(EPR)\u2005\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u6c2f\u56db\u82ef\u57fa\u9530\u535f\u5549\u2005(T(p-Cl)PPMn\u2162Cl)\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u5f02\u4e19\u82ef\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u6c22\u2005(CHP)\u2005\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u5728\u200525\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u4e0b\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u53cd\u5e94\u9636\u6bb5,\u2005\u5728\u2005T(p-Cl)PPMn\u2162Cl\u2005\u4e0e\u2005CHP\u2005\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u4ec5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6709\u5f02\u4e19\u82ef\u6c27\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u7684\u2005DMPO\u2005\u81ea\u65cb\u52a0\u5408\u7269. \u968f\u7740\u2005CHP\u2005\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u5927,\u2005\u8fd8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6709\u5f02\u4e19\u82ef\u8fc7\u6c27\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u81ea\u65cb\u52a0\u5408\u7269\u7684\u91cd\u6392\u4ea7\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7. \u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u5728\u2005T(p-Cl)PPMn\u2162Cl\u2005\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b,\u2005\u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u2005CHP\u2005\u662f\u4ee5\u2005O\u2013O\u2005\u952e\u5747\u88c2\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ea7\u751f\u5f02\u4e19\u82ef\u6c27\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u5f15\u53d1\u5206\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u5e76\u4e3b\u8981\u751f\u6210\u20052-\u82ef\u57fa-2-\u4e19\u9187. \u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u2005CHP\u2005\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0b,\u2005\u5f02\u4e19\u82ef\u6c27\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e0e\u2005CHP\u2005\u53cd\u5e94,\u2005\u4ea7\u751f\u5f02\u4e19\u82ef\u8fc7\u6c27\u81ea\u7531\u57fa. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u2005CHP\u2005\u5206\u89e3\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u5386\u7a0b.",

The effect of reaction time and temperature as well as the molar ratio of reactants on coking was investigated. Based on information obtained from experiments and a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the coke on the catalyst, we suggest a mechanism for coke formation. Results show that the formed coke mainly comes from the further oxidation of phenol, revealing that sequential deactivation occurs in the main reaction. Based on the suggested mechanism, a kinetic model for coke formation that describes coke deposition over the Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was developed.

The catalyst prepared at the calcination temperature of 500 \u00b0C showed the best performance, while the catalysts prepared above and below the 500 \u00b0C calcination temperature showed undesirable surface changes such as Pt active site degradation, Pt sintering, loss of Sn, etc. At the reaction temperature of 595 \u00b0C, Pt-Sn/SAPO-34 was stable and maintained surface metallic properties.\uff1a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7119\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u2005Pt-Sn/SAPO-34\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u2005\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u2005X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u2005\u5438\u9644\u3001X\u2005\u5c04\u7ebf\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u3001O2\u2005\u8109\u51b2\u70e7\u70ad\u3001H2\u2005\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81. \u5728\u5fae\u578b\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u2005Pt-Sn/SAPO-34\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5bf9\u4e19\u70f7\u8131\u6c22\u5236\u4e19\u70ef\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd,\u2005\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u7119\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6c14\u6c1b\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u2005\u7119\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e3a\u2005500\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027. \u5f53\u7119\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u2005500\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u65f6,\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u8868\u9762\u53d8\u5316,\u2005\u4f8b\u5982\u6d3b\u6027\u2005Pt\u2005\u4f4d\u70b9\u7684\u805a\u96c6\u3001Pt\u2005\u7684\u56e2\u805a\u3001Sn\u2005\u7684\u6d41\u5931\u7b49. \u5f53\u53cd\u5e94\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e3a\u2005595\u2005\u00b0C\u2005\u65f6,\u2005Pt-Sn/SAPO-34\u2005\u50ac\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a,\u2005\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u9762\u91d1\u5c5e\u72b6\u6001.",

     "abstract": "The dodecylsulfate anion (DS\u2212) embedded layered double hydroxide (LDH) supported nanopalladium catalyst (LDH-DS-Pd0) is a novel phosphine free recyclable heterogeneous catalytic system for palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling reactions and has been prepared for the first time. The intercalation of DS\u2212 changed the interlayer spacing of LDH from a microsize to a mesosize (2.9 nm) range, which favors the diffusion of average sized organic molecules. The Pd0 clusters obtained from the reduction of PdCl42\u2013-interlayered LDH were intercalated between the LDH layers and hence the growth of Pd0 clusters was effectively hindered by the limited space created by the intercalation of DS\u2212. This lipophilic catalyst was highly efficient in promoting the Suzuki reaction of aryl halides with phenylboronic acid. As a heterogeneous nanocatalyst, LDH-DS-Pd0 could be reused five times without significant loss of catalytic activity.\uff1a\u9996\u6b21\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u5341\u4e8c\u70f7\u57fa\u786b\u9178\u6839\u2005(DS\u2013)\u2005\u63d2\u5c42\u6c34\u6ed1\u77f3\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u94af\u65e0\u81a6\u914d\u4f53\u578b\u7684\u2005Suzuki\u2005\u5076\u8054\u53cd\u5e94\u50ac\u5316\u5242.

     "abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to investigate the geometric and electronic structure of molybdenum carbide loaded on ZSM-5 zeolite and the catalytic mechanism for methane C-H bond dissociation. Four active center models of the monomer and dimer models were proposed, which were Mo(CH2)2/ZSM-5, Mo(CH2)2CH3/ZSM-5, Mo2(CH2)4/ZSM-5, and Mo2(CH2)5/ZSM-5. The monomer model was located at the Br\u00f6nsted acid site of the T6 site positioned at the intersection of the channels of ZSM-5 zeolite. The dimer model was constructed at the T6\u2013\u2013\u2013T6 Br\u00f6nsted acid sites. Mo-carbene in the form of Mo=CH2 was formed in both the monomer and dimer models, and the optimized bond lengths of Mo-C were in reasonably good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. The frontier molecular orbitals in the active center were assigned to the p orbitals of the Mo=CH2 bonds in all four models. The catalytic activity of the Mo carbide active centers were investigated. It was found that the C-H bond of methane was heterogeneously dissociated with the H+ and the H3C\u2212 moieties bonded on the C and Mo atoms of the Mo=CH2 bond, respectively, and the p bond was broken simultaneously. The calculated activation energies of the methane C-H bond in the four models were between 106 and 196 kJ/mol. The Mo2(CH2)5/ZSM-5 model showed the best activity for methane C-H bond dissociation.\uff1a\u5e94\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u2005(DFT)\u2005\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u2005Mo/HZSM-5\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e0a\u78b3\u5316\u94bc\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784,\u2005\u4ee5\u53ca\u7532\u70f7\u2005C\u2013H\u2005\u952e\u5728\u8be5\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0a\u7684\u6d3b\u5316\u673a\u7406. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u78b3\u5316\u94bc\u5355\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u2005Mo(CH2)2/ZSM-5\u2005\u548c\u2005Mo(CH2)2CH3/ZSM-5,\u2005\u4e24\u79cd\u78b3\u5316\u94bc\u53cc\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u2005Mo2(CH2)4/ZSM-5\u2005\u548c\u2005Mo2(CH2)5/ZSM-5. \u5176\u4e2d\u5355\u94bc\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u2005ZSM-5\u2005\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u5b54\u9053\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\u2005T6\u2005\u4f4d\u7684\u2005Br\u00f6nsted\u2005\u9178\u4f4d\u4e0a,\u2005\u53cc\u94bc\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u2005T6\u2014T6\u2005\u76f8\u90bb\u53cc\u9178\u4f4d\u4e0a. \u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u2005Mo=CH2\u2005\u952e,\u2005\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u2005Mo\u2013C\u2005\u952e\u957f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u503c\u543b\u5408. \u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u7ebf\u5206\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u90fd\u5728\u2005Mo=CH2\u2005\u7684\u03c0\u952e\u4e0a. \u7532\u70f7\u6d3b\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u53d1\u751f\u2005C\u2013H\u2005\u952e\u5f02\u88c2,\u2005H+\u548c\u2005H3C\u2013\u6b8b\u57fa\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u653b\u2005Mo=CH2\u2005\u952e\u7684\u2005C\u2005\u548c\u2005Mo,\u2005\u4f7f\u2005\u03c0\u2005\u952e\u540c\u65f6\u65ad\u88c2. \u5728\u4ee5\u4e0a\u20054\u2005\u79cd\u78b3\u5316\u94bc\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a,\u2005\u7532\u70f7\u2005C\u2013H\u2005\u952e\u6d3b\u5316\u80fd\u90fd\u5728\u2005106\u223c196\u2005kJ/mol,\u2005\u4e14\u2005Mo2(CH2)5/ZSM-5\u2005\u5728\u7532\u70f7\u6d3b\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "Fast selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrogen (fast H2-SCR) was studied for the first time over Pd-based catalysts. Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 exhibited attractive activity and gave 100% NOx conversion above 200 \u00b0C. In contrast, Pd/MgO had no activity. The support had a decisive effect on the performance of the catalysts in fast H2-SCR reaction. Compared with the standard H2-SCR process, a significant enhancement of deNOx efficiency was achieved in the fast H2-SCR process. In situ DRIFT data indicated that the acceleration of ammonia formation and its reaction during the fast H2-SCR process should be the key point for the enhancement of deNOx efficiency.\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4715Pd\u4715\u57fa\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u6c22\u5feb\u901f\u9009\u62e9\u50ac\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u4715NOx\u2005\u53cd\u5e94\u4715(\u5feb\u901f\u4715H2-SCR\u4715\u53cd\u5e94).\u4715\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715Pd/Al2O3\u4715\u548c\u4715Pd/SiO2\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u6d3b\u6027,\u4715\u5728\u4715\u4715\u00b0C\u4715\u4ee5\u4e0a\u65f6\u4715NOx\u4715\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe\u4715100%\u4715\u4715\u4f46\u4715Pd/MgO\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8003\u5bdf\u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5747\u6ca1\u6709\u6d3b\u6027,\u4715\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8f7d\u4f53\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5feb\u901f\u4715H2-SCR\u4715\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528.\u4715\u4715\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u4715H2-SCR\u4715\u53cd\u5e94\u76f8\u6bd4,\u4715\u5feb\u901f\u4715H2-SCR\u4715\u53cd\u5e94\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4715NOx\u4715\u7684\u6d88\u9664\u6548\u7387.\u4715\u4715\u539f\u4f4d\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715\u5feb\u901f\u4715H2-SCR\u4715\u53cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6c28\u7269\u79cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u7eed\u53cd\u5e94\u901f\u7387\u7684\u52a0\u5feb.\u4715\u4715\u4715",

     "abstract": "A method to control the structure of the silica wall of mesoporous silica materials was proposed for trapping trace amounts of small pollutant molecules. The mesoporous silica materials containing pore wall defect voids were synthesized by controlling the pH of the synthesis system and the concentration of the organic surfactant and adding an inorganic salt to control the assembling rate of silica species on the surfactant micelle or change the form of the surfactant-aluminosilicate liquid crystal. X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, 29Si MAS nuclear magnetic resonance, and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the pore structure of the samples. Volatile nitrosamine N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) was selected as the probe to assess the adsorptive capacity of the composites. The introduction of aluminum species and the creation of structural defects in the mesoporous silica wall greatly improved the adsorption of NPYR.

     "abstract": "A series of Ni/AC catalyst samples were prepared by excessive impregnation, and the desulfurization activity of Ni/AC calcined at different temperatures was investigated. The Ni species on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at different temperatures were studied by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterization results showed that the Ni species on the catalyst calcined at 400 \u00b0C is Ni2O3. After calcination at 550 \u00b0C, NiO species is formed on the activated carbon. NiO and Ni coexist on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at 800 \u00b0C, and only pure Ni species is observed after calcination at 1000 \u00b0C. This suggested that Ni can form different chemical states on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at different temperatures. The desulfurization test results showed that the catalysts calcined at 550 and 800 \u00b0C exhibit good desulfurization activity, whereas the catalyst calcined at 400 \u00b0C has poor activity, indicating that different chemical states of Ni on the Ni/AC catalyst show different desulfurization performance, and NiO is the main active phase of the Ni/AC catalyst.\u91c7\u7528\u8fc7\u91cf\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4715Ni/AC\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u4715\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7119\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4715Ni/AC\u4715\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd,\u4715\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4715X\u4715\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u548c\u4715X\u4715\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81,\u4715\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ecf\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7119\u70e7\u540e\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u7684\u4715Ni\u4715\u7269\u79cd\u5f62\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.\u4715\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715\u7ecf\u4715400\u4715\u4715\u7119\u70e7\u540e\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u4715Ni\u4715\u7269\u79cd\u4e3a\u4715Ni2O3,\u4715550\u4715C\u4715\u7119\u70e7\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4715NiO\u4715\u7269\u79cd,\u4715800\u4715\u00b0C\u4715\u7119\u70e7\u540e\u4715Ni\u4715\u7269\u79cd\u53d8\u4e3a\u4715NiO\u4715\u548c\u4715Ni\u4715\u5171\u5b58,\u4715\u800c\u47151 000\u4715\u00b0C\u4715\u7119\u70e7\u540e\u53ea\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u8d28\u4715Ni.\u4715\u4715\u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7119\u70e7\u540e\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u4715Ni\u4715\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u5f62\u6001.\u4715\u4715\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715\u7ecf\u4715550\u4715\u00b0C\u4715\u548c\u4715800\u4715\u00b0C\u4715\u7119\u70e7\u540e\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027,\u4715\u800c\u4715400\u4715\u00b0C\u4715\u7119\u70e7\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u5dee.\u4715\u4715\u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u4715Ni\u4715\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5316\u5b66\u5f62\u6001\u662f\u9020\u6210\u8131\u786b\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0,\u4715\u800c\u4715NiO\u4715\u662f\u4715Ni/AC\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8131\u786b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6d3b\u6027\u7269\u76f8.",

     "abstract": "A series of Ce1-xZrxO2 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5) solid solutions were prepared by the micropore-diffused coprecipitation method with ammonia solution as precipitation agent. Co0.2/Ce1-xZrxO2 catalysts were prepared by the ultrasound-assisted incipient-wetness impregnation method. The effect of the Ce/Zr molar ratio on the catalytic activity for soot combustion was investigated. The Co0.2/Ce1-xZrxO2 catalysts gave very high activity for soot combustion under loose contact conditions between soot and catalyst, and the catalytic activity of Co0.2/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst was the highest for the soot combustion, whose T10, T50, T90, and SmCO2 were 316 \u00b0C, 385 \u00b0C, 413 \u00b0C, and 99.9%, respectively. Compared with when there was no catalyst, T10, T50, and T90 decreased by 136, 197, and 226 \u00b0C, respectively, and SmCO2 increased by 45.9%. This catalytic activity for soot combustion is as good as that of supported Pt catalysts, which was the best catalyst system so far reported for soot combustion under loose contact conditions. All the samples were characterized by the X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The results showed that nanometer Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solution supports can be prepared by the micropore-diffused coprecipitation method. The average particle size of the Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions was about 10 nm. Doping Zr affected the dispersion of Co over the Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions. The right Ce/Zr molar ratio was beneficial in enhancing the catalytic activity. Temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen measurements showed that the Co0.2/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst had the lowest reduction temperature (203 and 298 \u00b0C), which was in good agreement with its best catalytic activity.\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u5b54\u6269\u6563\u5171\u6c89\u6dc0\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4715Ce/Zr\u4715\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u7684\u4715Ce1-xZrxO2\u4715(x\u4715=\u47150,\u47150.2,\u47150.4,\u47150.5)\u4715\u56fa\u6eb6\u4f53,\u4715\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53\u7528\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u52a9\u5206\u6563\u7b49\u4f53\u79ef\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u4715Co0.2/Ce1-xZrxO2\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u4715\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u4715Ce/Zr\u4715\u6bd4\u5bf9\u5176\u50ac\u5316\u67f4\u6cb9\u8f66\u5c3e\u6c14\u78b3\u70df\u9897\u7c92\u7269\u71c3\u70e7\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.\u4715\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715\u5728\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0e\u78b3\u70df\u9897\u7c92\u677e\u6563\u63a5\u89e6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u4715Co0.2/Ce1-xZrxO2\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u50ac\u5316\u78b3\u70df\u9897\u7c92\u7269\u71c3\u70e7\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8.\u4715\u4715\u5176\u4e2d\u4715Co0.2/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u9ad8,\u4715T10,\u4715T50,\u4715T90\u4715\u548c\u4715SmCO2\u4715\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u4715316\u4715\u4715\u00b0C,\u4715385\u4715\u00b0C,\u4715413\u4715\u00b0C\u4715\u548c\u471599.9%.\u4715\u4715\u8fd9\u4e0e\u76ee\u524d\u6587\u732e\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u677e\u6563\u63a5\u89e6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6d3b\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u62c5\u8f7d\u4715Pt\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u76f8\u8fd1.\u4715\u4715\u5e94\u7528\u4715X\u4715\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u3001\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u4715Ce1-xZrxO2\u4715\u56fa\u6eb6\u4f53\u53ca\u4715Co0.2/Ce1-xZrxO2\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81.\u4715\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715Ce1-xZrxO2\u4715\u56fa\u6eb6\u4f53\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea7\u5c0f\u9897\u7c92\u7ec4\u6210\u4715(\u5e73\u5747\u7c92\u5f84\u5728\u471510\u4715nm\u4715\u5de6\u53f3).\u4715\u4715\u9002\u91cf\u7684\u4715Ce/Zr\u4715\u6bd4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u7acb\u65b9\u5c16\u6676\u77f3\u578b\u4715Co3O4\u4715\u5728\u4715Ce1-xZrxO2\u4715\u56fa\u6eb6\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5206\u6563,\u4715\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027.\u4715\u4715\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715Co0.2/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4f4e\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u7279\u6027\u4715\u4e0e\u5b83\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4.\u4715\u4715\u4715",

     "abstract": "Three 1,3-dipentylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ionic liquid isomers, 1,3-di-n-pentylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([D(n-C5)Im]PF6), 1,3-di-isopentylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([D(i-C5)Im]PF6), and 1,3-di(2-methylbutyl)imidazolium hexafluoro-phosphate ([D(2-mb)Im]PF6), were designed and synthesized. They were used as media for the synthesis of phenylethyl acetate catalyzed by Pseudomonas cepacial lipase. The activity and reactivity of the lipase in [D(2-mb)Im]PF6 is obviously higher than that in organic solvent hexane. Based on the temperature-controlled characteristics of [D(2-mb)Im]PF6, we designed a new route to synthesize phenylethyl acetate catalyzed by lipase, in which the reaction and the separation of the product were carried out under a relatively high and low temperature, respectively. By investigating the influence of various factors on the yield of product, optimal conditions for the synthesis of phenylethyl acetate were obtained, i.e., the amount of lipase 30 mg, the ionic liquid 1.0 g, water content 2%, reaction temperature 35 \u00b0C, and reaction time 48 h. Under the optimal conditions, the yield of phenylethyl acetate was up to 92.3%. Also, the stability of the lipase in the [D(2-mb)Im]PF6 medium was 7.4-fold that in hexane. The lipase in [D(2-mb)Im]PF6 was recycled 10 times without substantial diminution in activity. Moreover, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to follow the changes of enzyme structure in different solvents. The results showed that the lipase in the ionic liquid has excellent secondary structure stability and slightly big exposure level of amino-acid residues.\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u540c\u5206\u5f02\u6784\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u47151,3-\u4e8c\u6b63\u620a\u57fa\u54aa\u5511\u516d\u6c1f\u78f7\u9178\u76d0\u4715([D(n-C5)Im]PF6)\u30011,3-\u4e8c\u5f02\u620a\u57fa\u54aa\u5511\u516d\u6c1f\u78f7\u9178\u76d0\u4715([D(i-C5)Im]PF6)\u4715\u548c\u47151,3-\u4e8c\u4715(2-\u7532\u57fa\u4e01\u57fa)\u4715\u54aa\u5511\u516d\u6c1f\u78f7\u9178\u76d0\u4715([D(2-mb)Im]PF6).\u4715\u4715\u4ee5\u5047\u5355\u80de\u83cc\u8102\u80aa\u9176\u4715Pseudomonas cepacial \u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5408\u6210\u4e59\u9178\u82ef\u4e59\u916f\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u5e94,\u4715\u5206\u522b\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u53cd\u5e94\u4ecb\u8d28\u5bf9\u9176\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.\u4715\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0,\u4715\u9176\u5728\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53[D(2-mb)Im]PF6\u4715\u4e2d\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u53ca\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6709\u673a\u6eb6\u5242\u6b63\u5df1\u70f7.\u4715\u4715\u57fa\u4e8e[D(2-mb)Im]PF6\u4715\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u6e29\u63a7\u7279\u70b9,\u4715\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6e29\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6e29\u5206\u79bb\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u4e59\u9178\u82ef\u4e59\u916f\u5408\u6210\u8def\u7ebf.\u4715\u4715\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c,\u4715\u5f97\u5230\u5408\u6210\u4e59\u9178\u82ef\u4e59\u916f\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u53cd\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u4e3a\u4715\u4715\u4715mg\u4715\u9176,\u47151.0\u4715g\u4715\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53,\u47152%\u4715\u542b\u6c34\u91cf,\u4715\u53cd\u5e94\u6e29\u5ea6\u471535\u4715\u00b0C,\u4715\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u471548\u4715h.\u4715\u4715\u6b64\u65f6,\u4715\u4e59\u9178\u82ef\u4e59\u916f\u4ea7\u7387\u8fbe\u471592.3%.\u4715\u4715\u8102\u80aa\u9176\u5728[D(2-mb)Im]PF6\u4715\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u5728\u6b63\u5df1\u70f7\u4e2d\u7684\u47157.4\u4715\u500d,\u4715\u4e14\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u471510\u4715\u6b21\u540e\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u964d\u4f4e.\u4715\u4715\u6b64\u5916,\u4715\u91c7\u7528\u5706\u4e8c\u8272\u8c31\u548c\u5185\u6e90\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u8102\u80aa\u9176\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316.\u4715\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715\u8102\u80aa\u9176\u5728[D(2-mb)Im]PF6\u4715\u4e2d\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u6b8b\u57fa\u88f8\u9732\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027.\u4715",

The physical properties of these materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy. It is shown that the PEG template could be removed by washing, no significant impact of PEG molecular weight was observed on the surface area of the mesoporous SnO2 samples, but the factors such as PEG concentration, hydrothermal temperature, and calcination temperature exerted considerable influence on the pore structure of the SnO2 samples. After the hydrothermal treatment at 120 \u00b0C for 29 h with the molar ratio of PEG (with a molecular weight of 6000 g/mol) to Sn of 0.01, a wormhole-like mesoporous SnO2 sample with a high surface area of 161 m2/g and an average pore size of 2.6 nm was generated. The SnO2 samples exhibited good behavior in UV-light absorption. These porous materials are suitable for use as catalysts, supports, and gas sensors.\u4ee5\u805a\u4e59\u4e8c\u9187\u4715(PEG)\u4715\u4e3a\u6a21\u677f\u5242,\u4715\u6c2f\u5316\u9521\u4e3a\u9521\u6e90,\u4715\u5c3f\u7d20\u4e3a\u6c89\u6dc0\u5242,\u4715\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u51fa\u9ad8\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u7684\u8815\u866b\u72b6\u4ecb\u5b54\u56db\u65b9\u76f8\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u578b\u4715SnO2.\u4715\u4715\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4715PEG\u4715\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u6d53\u5ea6\u3001\u6c34\u70ed\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u7119\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4715SnO2\u4715\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f62\u8c8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.\u4715\u4715\u91c7\u7528\u4715X\u4715\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001N2\u4715\u5438\u9644-\u8131\u9644\u3001\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7d2b\u5916-\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8868\u5f81.\u4715\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715\u6a21\u677f\u5242\u53ef\u88ab\u6c34\u6d17\u9664\u53bb,\u4715PEG\u4715\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u5bf9\u4ecb\u5b54\u4715SnO2\u4715\u7684\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927,\u4715\u800c\u4715PEG\u4715\u6d53\u5ea6\u3001\u6c34\u70ed\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u7119\u70e7\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927.\u4715\u4715\u5728\u4ee5\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u4e3a\u47156000\u4715\u7684\u4715PEG\u4715\u4e0e\u4715Sn\u4715\u7684\u6469\u5c14\u6bd4\u4e3a\u47150.01\u4715\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u4715\u4e8e\u4715\u4715\u00b0C\u4715\u6c34\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u471529\u4715h\u4715\u540e\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u51fa\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u9ad8\u8fbe\u4715161\u4715m2/g\u4715\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u5b54\u5f84\u4e3a\u47152.6\u4715nm\u4715\u7684\u8815\u866b\u72b6\u4ecb\u5b54\u4715SnO2.\u4715\u4715\u6240\u5236\u5f97\u6837\u54c1\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u5438\u6536\u6027\u80fd,\u4715\u9002\u5b9c\u7528\u4f5c\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u3001\u8f7d\u4f53\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7b49.\u4715\u4715",

The effect of zirconia with the different surface areas of 34 and 87 m2/g (denoted ZrO2-34 and ZrO2-87, respectively) used as dispersants on the catalytic properties of the Ru-Zn catalyst was investigated. The crystallite sizes of ZrO2-34 and ZrO2-87 were 21.6 and 11.4 nm, respectively. They had similar purity and phases. Cyclohexene selectivity and the stability of the Ru-Zn catalyst dispersed using ZrO2-34 were better than that using ZrO2-87. This was due to the smaller surface area, bigger pore diameter, smaller particle size, narrower particle distribution, and bigger larger density of ZrO2-34.\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u70ed\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u522b\u4e3a34\u548c87m2/g\u7684ZrO2\u6837\u54c1(\u5206\u522b\u8bb0\u4e3aZrO2-34\u548cZrO2-87),\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4f5c\u5206\u6563\u5242\u65f6Ru-Zn\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u82ef\u9009\u62e9\u52a0\u6c22\u5236\u73af\u5df1\u70ef\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6027\u80fd.\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4e24\u4e2aZrO2\u6837\u54c1\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u7eaf\u5ea6\u548c\u7269\u76f8,\u6676\u7c92\u7c92\u5f84\u5206\u522b\u4e3a21.6\u548c11.4nm.\u5176\u4e2dZrO2-34\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u5b54\u5f84\u3001\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u7c92\u5f84\u3001\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u5806\u5bc6\u5ea6,\u56e0\u800c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4f5c\u82ef\u9009\u62e9\u52a0\u6c22\u5236\u73af\u5df1\u70efRu-Zn\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5242,\u4e14\u5faa\u73af\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6b21\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027.",

     "abstract": "The adsorption and oxidation of formaldehyde over 1%Pt/TiO2 under ambient conditions were investigated by in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and the deactivation of the catalyst was analyzed. It was found that formaldehyde could be oxidized to H2O and CO2 over Pt/TiO2 at ambient temperature, and the decomposition of formate was the key step below 100 \u00b0C. The catalyst deactivation at low temperature was attributed to the overcast of active sites by the formate that was failed to be decomposed in time. Nevertheless, the formate on Pt/TiO2 could be decomposed completely by increasing the reaction temperature to 100 \u00b0C, and the catalyst could be recovered simultaneously.\u91c7\u7528\u539f\u4f4d\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b1%Pt/TiO2\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u7532\u919b\u7684\u5438\u9644\u548c\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94,\u5e76\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5931\u6d3b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790.\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,Pt/TiO2\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u7532\u919b\u6c27\u5316\u6210H2O\u548cCO2,100oC\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7532\u9178\u6839\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u51b3\u901f\u6b65\u9aa4,\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5931\u6d3b\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u672a\u80fd\u53ca\u65f6\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7532\u9178\u6839\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4d,\u5347\u6e29\u81f3100oC\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u7532\u9178\u6839\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6d3b\u6027.",

     "abstract": "New catalysts of water soluble bifunctional metalloporphyrins M(TTMAPP)I4(X) (M = Co, Fe, Mn, and Cr; X = OAc, CF3COO, CCl3COO, OTs, Cl, Br, and I) were synthesized and used to catalyze the synthesis of cyclic carbonate through the coupling reaction of terminal epoxides and CO2. The effects of reaction temperature, various metals as the Lewis acidic center, counterions, and recycling of the catalysts were studied. 5,10,15,20-Tetra-(p-N,N,N-trimethylphenyl ammonium iodide)porphyrinium cobalt(III) acetate [Co(III)(TTMAPP) I4(OAc)] was efficient in the coupling reaction of various terminal epoxides and CO2 at 353 K under 667 kPa of CO2 pressure without solvent and molar ratio of epoxide:catalyst = 1000. It gave a propylene carbonate yield of 95.4% within 5 h. At 298 K in the presence of 1 ml methanol with the molar ratio of epoxide:catalyst = 2000, it gave a propylene carbonate yield of 19.4% within 24 h.

     "abstract": "Electrocatalytic reactions in direct alcohol fuel cells involve solid, liquid, and gas phase transport and electron and proton transfer. Better supports for the electrocatalysts are needed to carry out the reactions successfully and give a longer lifetime for the electrocatalysts. An ideal carbon support should have a high specific surface area, good electric conductivity, suitable pore size, favorable surface functional groups, good corrosion resistance, and low cost. Much work has been done on developing new carbon materials and modifying the carbon materials by pretreatment with acid, alkali, oxidant, or polymer to meet these requirements. In this work, commercial carbon supports that include the widely used carbon black Vulcan XC-72R, acetylene black, black pearls 2000, Printex XE-2, and Ketjen Black EC were briefly reviewed. New carbon materials such as carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, ordered porous carbon, mesocarbon microbeads, carbon nanohorns, carbon nanocoils, and carbon aerogels were reviewed in detail. These new carbon materials generally give better performance due to their special structure, better crystallinity, and faster mass transfer when compared to the commercial materials, and carbon nanotubes demonstrated the best performance up to the present time.\u7535\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6d89\u53ca\u56fa\u3001\u6db2\u3001\u6c14\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee5\u53ca\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u8d28\u5b50\u4f20\u5bfc,\u4715\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u987a\u5229\u8fdb\u884c\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e2d\u8d35\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u5229\u7528\u7387\u53ca\u5ef6\u957f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u5bff\u547d,\u4715\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u7535\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8f7d\u4f53\u5fc5\u987b\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u597d\u3001\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8010\u8150\u8680\u4ee5\u53ca\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8868\u9762\u57fa\u56e2\u7b49.\u4715\u4715\u4e3a\u6b64,\u4715\u78b3\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u6539\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8,\u4715\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u9178\u3001\u78b1\u3001\u6c27\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u6539\u53d8\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6027\u8d28,\u4715\u4ee5\u671f\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u7535\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u8981\u6c42;\u4715\u4715\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u78b3\u8f7d\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c.\u4715\u4715\u672c\u6587\u7b80\u8981\u8bc4\u8ff0\u4e86\u5546\u54c1\u70ad\u8f7d\u4f53\u5982\u78b3\u9ed1\u4715Vulcan XC-72R\u4715\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5b83\u7684\u4e59\u7094\u9ed1\u3001\u9ed1\u73cd\u73e0-2000\u3001Printex XE-2\u4715\u548c\u4715Ketjen Black EC\u4715\u7b49\u78b3\u6750\u6599\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u9187\u71c3\u6599\u7535\u6c60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528,\u4715\u4f46\u5bf9\u7eb3\u7c73\u78b3\u7ea4\u7ef4\u3001\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u3001\u6709\u5e8f\u591a\u5b54\u78b3\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u76f8\u78b3\u5c0f\u7403\u3001\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u89d2\u3001\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u5377\u548c\u78b3\u6c14\u51dd\u80f6\u7b49\u65b0\u578b\u78b3\u8f7d\u4f53\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8f83\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u8ff0.\u4715\u4715\u4e0e\u5546\u54c1\u78b3\u8f7d\u4f53\u76f8\u6bd4,\u4715\u65b0\u578b\u78b3\u8f7d\u4f53\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4715XC-72R\u4715\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd,\u4715\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u78b3\u6750\u6599\u5177\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7ed3\u6676\u6027\u80fd\u4715\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u4715\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f20\u8d28\u80fd\u529b.\u4715",

     "abstract": "Ammonium thiosulfate ((NH4)2S2O3) was used as a sulfiding agent for presulfiding CoMo and NiMoP catalysts. The effect of the amount of (NH4)2S2O3 on hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity was investigated. For the CoMo series, the use of a proper amount of (NH4)2S2O3 gave a higher HDS activity than when the catalyst was sulfided by H2S. SO42- formed during presulfidation modified the Al2O3 support and decreased the interaction between the active phase and support, and the activity was enhanced. However, a smaller amount of (NH4)2S2O3 used for the presulfidation would result in insufficient sulfidation, while a larger amount of (NH4)2S2O3 increased the particle size of the active phases, and both were harmful to HDS activity. For the NiMoP series, the presulfided catalysts were less active than those sulfided by H2S. This was ascribed to the high metal content and the addition of P to the catalyst.\u91c7\u7528\u786b\u4ee3\u786b\u9178\u94f5\u9884\u786b\u5316\u4715CoMo\u4715\u548c\u4715NiMoP\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u4715\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u9884\u786b\u5316\u5242\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cf\u5bf9\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u52a0\u6c22\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.\u4715\u4715\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4715\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u4715\u9884\u786b\u5316\u5242\u542b\u91cf\u9002\u4e2d,\u4715\u6c22\u6c14\u6d3b\u5316\u540e\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u786b\u5316\u6c22\u786b\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u7167\u50ac\u5316\u5242.\u4715\u4715\u9884\u786b\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4715SO42\u2212\u4715\u53ef\u4fee\u9970\u4715Al2O3\u8f7d\u4f53,\u4715\u51cf\u5f31\u4e86\u6d3b\u6027\u76f8\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528,\u4715\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u539f\u56e0.\u4715\u4715\u786b\u4ee3\u786b\u9178\u94f5\u542b\u91cf\u8fc7\u4f4e,\u4715\u5bfc\u81f4\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u786b\u5316\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168,\u4715\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0b\u964d,\u4715\u800c\u786b\u5316\u5242\u542b\u91cf\u8fc7\u9ad8,\u4715\u4f7f\u6d3b\u6027\u9897\u7c92\u957f\u5927,\u4715\u56e0\u800c\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11,\u4715\u8131\u786b\u6d3b\u6027\u964d\u4f4e.\u4715\u4715NiMoP\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u91d1\u5c5e\u542b\u91cf\u9ad8,\u4715\u4e0d\u6613\u88ab\u786b\u4ee3\u786b\u9178\u94f5\u5145\u5206\u786b\u5316,\u4715\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u786b\u5316\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7684\u4715NiMoP\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242.\u4715\u4715",

     "abstract": "The methanation of carbon dioxide on a Ni/La2O3 catalyst containing 10 wt% Ni prepared by the impregnation method was studied. The space-time yield of methane was 3000 g/(kg\u00b7h) at conditions of 350 \u00b0C, GHSV of 30000 h\u22121, 1.5 MPa pressure, and H2/CO2 molar ratio of 4. The selectivity for methane was 100% with different CO2 conversions. Combined with X-ray diffraction and H2 temperature-programmed reduction analyses, this suggested that the reaction mechanism on Ni/La2O3 may be different from that on Ni/\u03b3-Al2O3. The formation of lanthanum oxycarbonate (La2O2CO3) can play an important role in the activation of CO2.\u4ee5\u4715La2O3\u4715\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53,\u4715\u91c7\u7528\u6d78\u6e0d\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u471510%Ni/La2O3\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242,\u4715\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u8be5\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u4715CO2\u4715\u7532\u70f7\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u80fd.\u4715\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u4715(350\u4715\u00b0C)\u4715\u548c\u9ad8\u7a7a\u901f\u4715(\u7ea6\u471530000\u4715h\u20131)\u4715\u4e0b,\u4715\u7532\u70f7\u65f6\u7a7a\u6536\u7387\u53ef\u5927\u4e8e\u47153000\u4715g/(kg\u00b7h),\u4715\u65e0\u8bba\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u9ad8\u4f4e,\u4715\u7532\u70f7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u4715100%.\u4715\u4715X\u4715\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u548c\u4715H2-\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u7b49\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715CO2\u4715\u5728\u4715Ni/La2O3\u4715\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u4e0a\u7684\u52a0\u6c22\u673a\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u4715Ni/\u03b3-Al2O3\u4715\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c,\u4715\u5e76\u4e14\u4715La2O2CO3\u4715\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6d3b\u6027. \u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3;\u4715\u4715\u7532\u70f7\u5316;\u4715\u4715\u954d;\u4715\u4715\u6c27\u5316\u9567;\u4715\u4715\u8d1f\u8f7d\u578b\u50ac\u5316\u5242;\u4715\u4715\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u9178\u9567",

     "abstract": "Monolayer Fe films on Pt(111) and their derived structures under different environments were investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The growth of monolayer Fe films was seen at 487 K. The surface composition and structure of the Fe/Pt(111) surface were monitored by XPS and STM during stepwise annealing under vacuum. Surface Fe was driven into the subsurface region during annealing above 800 K. This resulted in a Pt-skin surface of Pt/Fe/Pt(111). Oxidation of the Pt-skin structure in O2 produced a FeO surface structure, FeO/Pt(111). This was transformed into a surface Fe structure by mild reduction in H2 (600 K) and into subsurface Fe by further severe reduction (800 K). The transformation of surface Fe (FeO) and subsurface Fe in Pt(111) was reversible in cycled oxidation and reduction treatments. The results demonstrated the controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surfaces. This can be important for the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts.\u5229\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u96a7\u9053\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u4715(STM)\u4715\u548c\u4715X\u4715\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u4715(XPS)\u4715\u5bf9\u4715Pt(111)\u4715\u8868\u9762\u5236\u5907\u7684\u4715Fe\u4715\u5355\u5c42\u8584\u819c\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u6c14\u6c1b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76.\u4715\u4715\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4715487\u4715K\u4715\u7684\u4715Pt(111)\u4715\u8868\u9762\u5236\u5907\u51fa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4715Fe\u4715\u5355\u5c42\u8584\u819cFe/Pt(111).\u4715\u4715\u5bf9\u4715Fe/Pt(111)\u4715\u4f9d\u6b21\u5347\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u9ad8\u771f\u7a7a\u9000\u706b,\u4715STM\u4715\u548c\u4715XPS\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u9000\u706b\u6e29\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4715800 K\u4715\u65f6,\u4715\u8868\u9762\u4715Fe\u4715\u539f\u5b50\u6269\u6563\u5230\u6b21\u8868\u5c42\u533a\u57df,\u4715\u5f62\u6210\u6b21\u8868\u5c42\u4715Fe\u4715\u7ed3\u6784Pt/Fe/Pt(111).\u4715\u4715Pt/Fe/Pt(111)\u4715\u5728\u4715O2\u4715\u6c27\u5316\u6c14\u6c1b\u4e2d\u7ecf\u4715850 K\u4715\u9000\u706b\u53ef\u8f6c\u53d8\u6210\u8868\u9762\u4715FeO\u4715\u8584\u819cFeO/Pt(111).\u4715\u4715FeO/Pt(111)\u4715\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u4715H2\u4715\u8fd8\u539f\u6c14\u6c1b\u4e2d\u4715(600 K)\u4715\u8f6c\u53d8\u6210\u8868\u9762\u4715Fe\u4715\u7ed3\u6784,\u4715\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u8fd8\u539f\u5904\u7406\u4715(800\u4715K)\u4715\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u4715Pt/Fe/Pt(111).\u4715\u4715\u63a7\u5236\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6c14\u6c1b\u5728\u4715O2\u4715\u548c\u4715H2\u4715\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362,\u4715\u4f7f\u5f97\u8868\u9762\u4715Fe\u4715(FeO)\u4715\u548c\u6b21\u8868\u9762\u4715Fe\u4715\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u590d\u5730\u8f6c\u53d8.\u4715\u4715\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4715Fe-Pt\u4715\u8868\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u5907,\u4715\u53ef\u4e3a\u5408\u7406\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4ef7\u5ec9\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u63d0\u4f9b\u501f\u9274.",

     "abstract": "Based on density functional theory calculation with periodic boundary conditions, the possibility of the direct coupling of methanol into ethene by oxonium ylide mechanism was investigated. The calculated results indicate that the energy barriers for the formation of dimethyl ether and trimethyl oxonium ion inside HSAPO-34 zeolite are 1.68 and 0.93 eV, respectively. The suggested intermediate oxonium ylide is very unstable and the energy barriers for the formation of C-C bond are over 3.0 eV by concerted pathway. It is thus concluded that the methanol to olefin reaction cannot follow the oxonium ylide mechanism.\u4715\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4715HSAPO-34\u4715\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e0a\u7532\u9187\u901a\u8fc7\u6c27\u9393\u53f6\u7acb\u5fb7\u673a\u7406\u76f4\u63a5\u8026\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4e59\u70ef\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027.\u4715\u4715\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u4715\u4e8c\u7532\u919a\u548c\u4e09\u7532\u57fa\u6c27\u9393\u79bb\u5b50\u5728\u4715HSAPO-34\u4715\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u5792\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u47151.68\u4715\u548c\u47150.93\u4715eV,\u4715\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u6c27\u9393\u53f6\u7acb\u5fb7\u4e0d\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b58\u5728,\u4715\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u660e\u4715C\u2013C\u4715\u952e\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u53cd\u5e94\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u80fd\u5792\u5747\u8d85\u8fc7\u47153.0\u4715eV.\u4715\u4715\u56e0\u6b64\u4715\u7532\u9187\u5236\u70ef\u70c3\u50ac\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u9075\u5faa\u6c27\u9393\u53f6\u7acb\u5fb7\u673a\u7406.\u4715",
