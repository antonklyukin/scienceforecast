     "abstract": "Lignin is generated as a waste biomass from pulp and paper industry. The majority of kraft lignin is currently combusted as a low-grade energy source. Lignin valorization has been considered a feasible option to sustainable production of chemicals and liquid fuels in the long run. This study reports a novel thermolysis process that selectively converts black liquor lignin into guaiacol and its derivatives in high-boiling-point hydrocarbon solvents: n-hexadecane (n-H) and 1-methyl naphthalene (1-MN). The operating pressure for lignin thermolysis in n-H and 1-MN is much lower than those in lignin liquefaction with low-boiling-point solvents, such as water, methanol, and ethanol. 1-MN performed better than n-H in terms of lignin conversion and liquid yield. The liquid products were 56\u202fwt% and 24\u202fwt% for 1-MN and n-H as solvent respectively. Reaction temperature and reaction time rotating were investigated. Low temperature and short reaction time are favorable for generating Guaiacol. Compared to 1-MN as solvent, n-H promotes the production of guaiacol. The reaction mechanisms of lignin depolymerization to chemicals in different solvents were proposed. Solvent chemical properties and H abstraction processes from solvents play a key role in the selectivity of guaiacol.",

     "abstract": "Inherent metallic species retained by coal char or coke, such as Na and Ca, behave as catalysts in gasification. The char/coke normally contains inherent SiO2, which can react with the inherent catalysts to form silicates, resulting in catalyst deactivation over the range of pyrolysis, carbonization and gasification, and thereby reducing the char/coke reactivity. The present authors simulated the inherent catalyst deactivation experimentally by blending a Victorian lignite with SiO2, briquetting the SiO2/lignite blend, carbonizing the briquette, and then gasifying the coke with CO2. The kinetic analysis of the gasification employed a comprehensive model, which assumed progress in parallel of non-catalytic and catalytic gasification. The model quantitatively described the measured kinetics of the coke gasification with different SiO2 contents over a range of coke conversion up to 99.9%. The kinetic analysis revealed that the SiO2 deactivated substantial and entire portions of the most active catalyst and its precursor, respectively, before the gasification (i.e., during the carbonization). The catalyst deactivation also occurred during the gasification, but mainly following a self-deactivation mechanism that involved no silicates formation.",

     "abstract": "A solid oxygen carrier is usually applied in a chemical looping conversion process to transfer oxygen from the gaseous oxygen source to the fuel, which can avoid the direct contact of these two reactants and hence decrease the energy penalty of separation. Among the solid oxygen carriers, iron-based oxygen carrier is an attractive option due to its inherent properties of low cost and environmentally-friendly. Several processes such as chemical looping combustion (CLC), chemical looping gasification (CLG), chemical looping reforming (CLR), and chemical looping hydrogen generation (CLHG) have been proposed and investigated based on the iron-based oxygen carrier. In this review, the relevant researches on the iron-based oxygen carrier are summarized, which include the characteristics of iron oxides, the preparations of the iron-based oxygen carrier based on the iron ores and some other low-cost iron contained materials, and their applications in the continuous operated chemical looping conversion processes. It is expected to provide a better understanding for the development and utilization of iron-based oxygen carrier in the practical chemical looping processes.",

     "abstract": "Shale gas is an unconventional gas source with substantial development potential. In this study, Longmaxi Formation shale from the Silurian system in Yibin, Sichuan Province was collected for characterizing total organic carbon (TOC), clay mineral content, and other reservoir properties. The pore structure of shale was analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and low-temperature N2 adsorption\u2013desorption method. Isothermal adsorption experiments for CH4 and CO2 mixtures in shale samples were performed. The second Virial coefficient was used to calculate for the compressibility factor of the gas mixture. The influencing factors of gas adsorption capacity of shale were analyzed. Finally, the CH4 and CO2 adsorption capacities and selection of shale samples were investigated. Under low pressure, the total gas mixture capacity of shale samples was positively correlated with pressure. When the pressure increased to a certain extent, the growth trend of gas mixture adsorption capacity of shale samples decreased. The mixed gas adsorption volume is high at 50\u202f\u00b0C for all the proportion. Given the same temperature and pressure, the CO2 adsorption of shale samples is higher than the CH4 adsorption. In competitive adsorption, shale prefers to adsorb CO2. Therefore, CO2 is easier to be adsorbed by shale and this causes CH4 to be released from the adsorption site.",

     "abstract": "Kinetics of thermal decomposition of benzene on lignite-derived char was investigated at 900\u202f\u00b0C by applying a new method to continuously monitor the char surface activity. Benzene vapor was continuously forced to pass through a micro fixed bed of char with residence time as short as 7.6\u202fms, and then detected continuously by a flame-ionization detector. Results showed the presence of two different types of char surfaces; consumptive Type I surface and non-consumptive (sustainable) Type II surface. Type I surface of a partially CO2-gasified char had an capacity of carbon deposit from benzene over 20\u202fwt%-char and an initial activity (represented by a first-order rate constant) as high as 160\u202fs\u22121. Both of them decreased with increasing carbon deposit due to consumption of micropores accessible to benzene, and finally became zero leaving Type II surface that had a very stable activity with rate constant of 4\u202fs\u22121. The chars without gasification had capacities of Type I surfaces smaller by two orders of magnitude than the partially gasified char, while the Type II surfaces had activities similar to that of the partially gasified char. It was found that Type II surface converted benzene into not only carbon deposit but also diaromatics and even greater aromatics. Composition of the greater aromatics was unknown because they were deposited onto the reactor wall immediately after passing through the char bed.",

     "publication date": "04-2019",
     "abstract": "Chemical Looping Combustion is a novel process that generates sequestration-ready CO2 from the combustion of woody biomass without requiring a gas separation step and without diluting the CO2 with N2 from air. This is achieved by oxidizing the fuel with lattice oxygen of a metal oxide oxygen carrier. When using cheap and abundant ilmenite ore (FeTiO3) as the oxygen carrier, the rather low reactivity towards volatiles released from the biomass upon devolatilization, as well as detrimental structural changes due to a segregation of Fe and Ti in the material, are of concern. These issues can be addressed by modifying ilmenite with Ca via melt infiltration. In this work, we demonstrate that this modification results in a good distribution of Ca throughout the ilmenite particles that a) prevents detrimental Fe/Ti segregation, b) improves the mechanical stability of the particle compared to materials prepared by solution impregnation and c) improves the reactivity of this material towards hydrogen and wet methane. Moreover, fixed bed experiments showed that the Ca modification not only resulted in increased methane conversion, but also in an increased degree of oxidation of gaseous intermediates CO and H2. We thus conclude that the performance of ilmenite in Chemical Looping processes can be significantly enhanced by Ca modification of ilmenite either prior to use or in-situ during operation of this bed material with Ca-rich fuels such as woody biomass.",

     "abstract": "Lignin represents the most significant potential source of sustainable aromatic compounds. Currently, the vast majority of technical lignin could be sourced from industrial paper production and in particular the Kraft process, where it is conventionally combusted for chemicals recovery and heat generation (e.g. for plant operation). While in recent years several efforts have concerned the conversion of native lignin (i.e. as found in nature) during biomass processing, there has also been significant focus on the \u201cBase Catalyzed\u201d conversion of technical lignin. This process is of significant interest, since it could be potentially integrated into existing Kraft mill infrastructure. The following review paper focuses on the development of the hydrothermal base catalyzed depolymerization (HBCD) of lignin, as a basis to produce valuable chemical compounds. Focus will be placed on NaOH catalyzed reactions in the aqueous phase, as this approach is considered the most promising. Focus is placed on reaction conditions and characterization of monomeric aromatic compounds from the HBCD approach. Oligomers, as largest product fraction, is also considered, however, these are seldom analyzed in detail in the literature and ideas on further use are scarce. The review also addresses findings in literature concerning the assessment of the solid, liquid, and gas product streams arising from HBCD. From this paper, process conditions for HBCD reactions can be derived and it is shown that the solid phase has a high potential for further valorization and downstream processing.",

Mixing aqueous solutions of tannin and sodium silicate indeed produced the very fast gelation of tannins, thus leading to organic hydrogels which were first converted into organic aerogels by supercritical drying, and then into carbon aerogels after pyrolysis at 900\u202f\u00b0C. Subsequent dissolution of the silica nanoparticles thus formed within the carbon structure further increased significantly the porosity of the materials. Silica thus appeared to be both the gelation catalyst and a pore-directing agent. In this work, the influence on the porosity of the silica/tannin ratio and of the nature of the etching agent used for removing the silica was thoroughly investigated by combining several techniques. The conditions for producing either the most porous materials or those with the highest surface areas were identified and discussed.",

     "abstract": "The effects of three different mixing methods of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) and HZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst on the stability for dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation were investigated. When the bifunctional catalyst was prepared by method A (mixing powder without pelletization), there was no significant change in DME production and catalyst stability when the HZSM-5 loading was varied between 0.1\u202fg and 0.5\u202fg with a fixed CZA loading of 0.5\u202fg,. When the bifunctional catalysts were prepared by method B (pressed into pellets of CZA and pellets of HZSM-5 and then mixed) and method C (mixed CZA and HZSM-5 powders, then pressed into pellets), the mixing methods did not initially impact CO2 conversion and had a minor effect on DME yield. However, long-term tests (100\u202fh) indicated that the mixing method had a significant influence on the catalyst stability. Method B showed the best stability and the extent of catalyst deactivation followed the sequence of method B\u202f<\u202fmethod A\u202f<\u202fmethod C. Characterizations of spent catalysts indicated that method B could reduce the extent of copper (Cu) oxidation, which due to the relatively low surface contact between Cu active sites and HZSM-5. Large amounts of water generated in CO2 hydrogenation to synthesize DME and intimate contact between CZA and HZSM-5 catalyst could induce severe oxidation of Cu and metal ions migration from hydrogenation catalyst to HZSM-5, which can result in the number reduction of acidic sites.",

Experimental results showed that the order of metal catalyst activity for hydrogen generation was Ni/MgO\u202f>\u202fFe/MgO\u202f>\u202fCu/MgO.

     "abstract": "This study aims to compare the pyrolysis behavior of Huadian oil shale in two infrared heating fixed bed reactors with different directions of infrared beam. Our previous work has shown that fast pyrolysis of oil shale conducted in the shallow fixed bed infrared heating reactor (co-current) presented the massive secondary reactions, which lowered the shale oil production (Siramard et al., 2017). Conversely, the cross-current infrared achieved shale oil yields higher than the Fischer Assay oil yield (13.07\u202fwt% of dry basis), such as 117.7% of the Fischer Assay yield at our realized highest heating rate of 7\u202f\u00b0C/s under a specified pyrolysis temperature of 550\u202f\u00b0C. The shale oil from the cross-current infrared heating reactor was obviously heavier than the oil obtained from the co-current heating reactor. Thus, the infrared cross heating evidently suppressed the secondary reactions toward volatile. Our realized shale oil yield could reach 13.67\u202fwt% or 122.5% of the Fischer Assay yield under reducing pyrolysis pressure of 0.6\u202fatm, indicating that lower pressure is also beneficial to the release of volatile and reduction of the secondary cracking reactions. This work shows essentially that the infrared cross heating provides an effective merge of the advantages from quick heating and minimization of secondary cracking reactions to enable the shale oil yields being higher than the Fischer Assay oil yield.",

     "abstract": "In this study, the Huadian oil shale (HD-R) and Balikun oil shale (BLK-R) were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed pyrolyzer at 360\u2013530\u202f\u00b0C. Based on the migration and conversion of organic carbon, their pyrolysis characteristics were investigated and compared. The aliphaticity of Huadian kerogen (HD-K) and Balikun kerogen (BLK-K) are 80.53% and 52.83%, respectively. The HD-K contains more CO, which will render the depolymerization and decomposition of kerogen to occur at low temperatures to produce volatile matters. Thus, the cumulative conversion of the Huadian shale oil is greater than the Balikun shale oil at 390\u2013435\u202f\u00b0C. The aliphatic carbons of the BLK-K are mainly present as short methylene chains attached to aromatic rings. They will leave the kerogen matrix with the breakage of relatively weaker CC bonds at \u03b2-sites from aromatic rings at medium temperatures. By contrast, aliphatic carbons of the HD-K are dominated by long aliphatic chains. High temperature is necessary to break other stronger CC to form shale oil and gaseous species, which appears to make the oil accumulation conversion of BLK-R exceed that of HD-R at 450\u2013510\u202f\u00b0C.",

     "abstract": "For disposal of scrap tyres, there have been a lot of studies done by previous researchers, but it yet remains a longstanding challenge in practice. To find a solution for this problem, the feasibility of a proposed approach in a laboratory scale was tested. The pyrolysis of scrap tyres pretreated by waste coal tar (noted as \u201cas-pretreated\u201d tyres) was performed in a batch reactor at atmospheric pressure. Waste coal tar was used to modify the scrap tyres to improve the pyrolysis efficiency of scrap tyres input and the quality of the product tar. The swelling behavior of scrap tyres soaked in waste coal tar at 10\u202f\u00b0C, effect of pyrolysis temperature on the product yields, and the synergies during pyrolysis of the as-pretreated tyres and co-pyrolysis of scrap tyres/waste coal tar mixture were all investigated in detail. The results observed found that by comparison of the calculated yields and the observed experimental yields for pyrolysis products, the synergy from co-pyrolysis of scrap tyres/waste coal tar mixture boosted the gas yield without increasing the tar yield. In contrast, the synergy during pyrolysis of the as-pretreated tyres could enhance the tar yield, but reduced the gas and char yields. According to the distillation range analyses of the tar, more light fractions were found in the tar from pyrolysis of the as-pretreated tyres, in which the gasoline fraction, diesel fraction and kerosene fraction were 38.4\u202fwt%, 46.8\u202fwt% and 50.2\u202fwt%, respectively.

The oil from the reactor with internals contained more aliphatic hydrocarbons and fewer aromatic hydrocarbons, leading to its higher H/C atomic ratios as for crude petroleum oil. The char yield was relatively stable for two beds and showed the higher heating values (HHVs) of about 23\u202fMJ/kg.

     "abstract": "China is rich of oil shale as one of alternative fossil energy resources. The exploitation and utilization of oil shale are strategically important in alleviating the shortage of oil and gas resources in China. However, low utilization rate of raw material, low oil yield, and high content of heavy components in the oil are the main problems in current Fushun type oil shale refinery technology. An indirectly heated moving bed is developed to de-bottleneck Fushun type technology. The oil shale refinery process with the indirectly heated moving bed is modeled and simulated in this work. Based on the simulation, a techno-economic analysis is performed and compared with the conventional Fushun oil shale refinery process. Results show that: for a shale refinery of 3.0\u202fMt/y scale, 375\u202ft/h oil shale retorting requires 149.6\u202fMW of heat, in which 60% of the heat is produced by combustion of the oil shale pyrolysis gas, while remaining 40% from the coal gasified gas. In consideration of investment and operation, the cost of product shale oil of the new process is 2636 CNY/t, which is 12% lower than that of the conventional Fushun refinery process. This benefit comes from higher utilization of raw material and oil yield of the new process. The competitive crude oil price of the indirectly heated moving bed refinery process is about 51\u202f$/bbl, while that of the Fushun refinery process is 58\u202f$/bbl. During 2017\u202fyear, the crude oil price fluctuates at around 50\u202f$/bbl, thus the new indirectly heated moving bed refinery process shows better economic competitiveness.",

Moreover, its techno-economic performance is analyzed and compared to a conventional oil shale retorting process with solid heat carrier (OSR-SHC). Several key parameters are investigated and optimized during the simulation process. For example, the optimal retorting temperature is set to 500\u202f\u00b0C.

In this work, a new kinetic model containing four hydrocarbon lumps (feedstock, diesel, gasoline, cracking gas) was developed to describe the coal tar hydrogenation process, the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt\u2019s optimization algorithm was used to determine the kinetic parameters by minimizing the sum of square errors between experimental and calculated data, the predictions from model validation showed a good agreement with experimental values. Subsequently, an adiabatic reactor model based on proposed lumped kinetic model was constructed to further investigate the performance of hydrogenation fixed-bed units, the mass balance and energy balance within the phases in the reactor were taken into accounts in the form of ordinary differential equation. An application of the reactor model was performed for simulating the actual bench-scale plant of coal tar hydrogenation, the simulated results on the products yields and temperatures distribution along with the reactor are shown to be good consistent with the experimental data.",

     "abstract": "Thermochemical conversion of fuels via pyrolysis/carbonization, cracking, gasification and combustion has to involve a number of individual reactions called attribution reactions to form an intercorrelated reaction network for any conversion process. By separating one or some attribution reactions from the others to decouple their interactions existing in the reaction network, the so-called reaction decoupling enables a better understanding of the complex thermal conversion process and further the optimization of the conditions for attribution reactions as well as the entire conversion process to realize advanced performances. The dual bed conversion and two-stage conversion are the two representative types of fuel conversion technologies developed in recent years based on reaction decoupling. Many technical advantages have been proven for such decoupling fuel conversion technologies, such as poly-generation of products, low-cost production of high-grade products, elimination of undesirable products or pollutants, easy operation and control, and so on. The treated fuels with decoupling conversion technologies mainly include solid biomass and coal, as well as liquid petroleum oil. This paper is devoted to reiteration of the reaction decoupling concept and further to reviewing the research, developments and successful applications of several decoupling fuel conversion technologies of two such types by using fluidized bed as their major reactors.",

     "abstract": "Surface active agents (surfactants) are chemicals that can accumulate at the surface of a liquid, or interface between two phases with the role of changing the surface tension of the interface. Depending on their structures, they have many applications in industries, such as the petroleum, mining, pulping and textiles, wherein they are utilized as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents and dispersants. Most of commonly used surfactants are oil-based chemicals. However, using environmentally friendly feedstocks to produce surfactant is desirable to lessen the environmental impact of surfactant production and use in industry. Lignin is an attractive candidate for this purpose as it is inexpensive and readily available. Lignin and lignin derivatives, such as lignosulfonates, can be chemically modified to produce surfactants with different chemical and physical properties, which makes them suitable for a wide variety of applications. The lignin types and the processes performed for lignin production affect the properties of generated lignin significantly, which in turn influence the reactivity and the efficiency of the reaction for surfactant generation. In this review, the characteristics and applications of oil-based surfactants, and the efforts to produce lignin-based surfactants are reviewed. As oil-based surfactants with altered properties are available in the market, several different pathways can be followed for producing lignin-based surfactants. The advantages and disadvantages of using lignin-based surfactants are also discussed.",

A binder and a non-caking coal were mixed in different ratios and carbonized at 1000\u202f\u00b0C to produce coal-binder composites. Two binders, one from coal origin and other from oil origin were used. Effect of coal-binder mixing ratio and base coal particle size on the fracture strength of composites was investigated. Bonding of binder with the coal particles at coal-binder interface and development of connected carbon matrix were primarily responsible for the strength of the carbonized coal composites. The trend of change in fracture strength as a function of coal-binder fraction was similar for both the binders. However, for same coal-binder mixing ratio, binder type strongly affected the maximum strength achieved. Fracture strength was found to be primarily dependent on the coal-binder mixing ratio and base coal particle size. The main finding of this study is that the irrespective of binder type, for a given base coal particle size there was only one coal-binder mixing ratio at which the maximum strength was obtained. The binder fraction at which the highest strength observed was correlated to the carbon matrix connectivity index.",

The higher heating value of liquefaction products is close to that of petroleum crude oil. The oil fraction from Botryococcus braunii liquefaction was specified for the first time, and the liquefaction mechanism was proposed. Due to the high lipid content of Botryococcus braunii, the liquefaction product distribution is quite distinct from other microalgae. The produced biocrudes contain \u223c9% oxygen, with oleic acid as the main source. Amides derived from oleic acid and proteins are the major nitrogenates in the biocrudes. The biocrude was processed using catalytic cracking and hydrotreating. Catalytic cracking mostly produces aromatics, while the majority of hydrotreating products are straight and branched hydrocarbons. The oxygen content in the catalytic cracking products was very low. The presence of amides in the hydrotreating feed changes the reaction pathway from hydrodecarboxylation to hydrodeoxygenation as a result of the competitive adsorption of amides on the active sites for hydrodecarboxylation. Both processes show satisfactory denitrogenation performance. Catalytic cracking displays superior ability than hydrotreating with regards to the removal of oxygen.",

The deployment of such a CEPS system will have a potential to remove more than 500 million tonnes CO2 from air annually, and increase the current food productivity by more than 15 times than the open field operation.

The DMFC power density showed a maximum at about a 1.5\u202fmg\u202fcm\u22122 PtRu loading that corresponds to about an 80\u202f\u00b5m layer thickness.

     "abstract": "Slow pyrolysis of a typical high-ash lignite in China was carried out in atmospheres of N2, 20%CO2/N2, 40%CO2/N2, and 60%CO2/N2 in a fixed bed reactor. The evolution of char, tar, and gases in yield and characteristics, and the physico-chemical characteristics of chars in different atmospheres were compared. Results revealed that CO2 almost behaves as an inert gas in the evolution of char and CO before 600\u202f\u00b0C. The decrease in char and CO2 yields and the increase in CO yield at temperatures higher than 600\u202f\u00b0C are ascribed to the occurrence of char-CO2 gasification. The higher the CO2 level present in the atmosphere, the higher the severity of the gasification becomes. Introducing CO2 into the atmosphere raises tar and water yields but cuts down H2, CH4, and C2H6 yields. The promotion of tar yield results from the higher phenols and aliphatics yields in the presence of CO2. The reduction of H2 yield is associated with the increase in water yield, while the decline of light hydrocarbon gases is connected with the suppression effects of CO2 on methyl decomposition. The role of inherent minerals was also investigated by comparing product yields from raw coal and demineralized coal. The comparison indicated that the char-CO2 gasification rate is sharply reduced to nearly zero without the catalytic effects of calcium, iron, and magnesium minerals. The evolution of tar and light hydrocarbon gases in the CO2-containing atmosphere greatly depends on inherent minerals. Without minerals, tar yield is inhibited in the presence of CO2. In the absence of minerals, CO2 hardly has influences on CH4 and C2H6 yields.",

     "abstract": "This paper reported the facile preparation of pyrolytic carbon derived from spent coffee grounds and the evaluation of its electrochemical performance when used as anode in sodium-ion battery. X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope, Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller were employed to characterize the structure of pyrolytic carbon. Electrochemical performances were tested by constant current charge\u2013discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results showed that the pyrolytic carbon possess a porous structure (1\u20132\u202f\u03bcm) and a specific surface area of 94.35\u202fm2\u202fg\u22121. When used as anodes in sodium-ion batteries, a reversible capacity of 154.2\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg\u22121 at a current density of 200\u202fmA\u202fg\u22121 after 50 cycles was obtained. Several electrolytes were evaluated and their electrochemical performances were compared. The result indicated that this material has excellent storage capacity and good cycling stability. Our method provided a preparation of pyrolytic carbon from environmentally friendly resources.",
