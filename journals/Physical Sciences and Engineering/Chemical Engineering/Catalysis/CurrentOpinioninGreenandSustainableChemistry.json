However, the natural complexity and degradation stability of lignin make the depolymerization a highly challenging task. Several efforts have been pursued for the selective degradation of the biopolymer into suitable compounds. However, there are only a few technical approaches for the degradation of lignin to aromatic fine chemicals. Organic electrosynthesis is the synthetic method that enables the direct use of electricity for the production of valuable compounds. Moreover, electro-organic synthesis represents a sustainable and modern technology. In addition, it is a powerful and \u201cgreen\u201d tool for the depolymerization and utilization of the renewable feedstock lignin.

Globally, it is estimated that about 35% of the quantities of construction and demolition waste (CDW) produced are directed to landfills, without any further treatment, although efforts to recycle and reuse CDW are increasingly being made. This paper, through a review of recent literature, focuses on the factors, barriers and motivations that influence the generation and management of CDW. Based on the analysis, two indicators are calculated for selected countries using the latest available data and an explanatory model is developed with a view to enabling identification of the factors affecting CDW generation. Most importantly, a concept map is created involving thirty-six different nodes that represents existing knowledge with respect to the components of the CDW system, and the positive or negative relationships between them.",

Despite the recommendation to utilize organic material in accordance to a cascading use, energetic use is predominantly carried out. Organic material, however, contains various secondary raw materials, such as functionalized organic compounds. Organic compounds contain unique functional groups which are urgently needed to cope with the limitation of fossil resources. However, an industrial utilization process solely relying on wasted food as feedstock seems paradox as it is based on an unsustainable behavior. Actions against the wastage of food consequently have an impact on the feedstock availability of utilization processes. It is assumed that due to economic reason more edible food fractions are processed for instance in biorefineries for the production of high-value products.",

     "abstract": "Nanomaterials are becoming widely used in areas such as biomedical applications, food, environmental protection, energy production, information technology and agriculture. As such, more research has been conducted on their synthesis and manufacturing from a variety of feedstocks. However, concerns regarding their impact on human health and the environment leads researchers to conduct a variety of \u2018sustainability\u2019 assessments. The purpose of this paper was to review the current opinion of sustainability assessments concerning nanomaterials. Major assessment tools were reviewed including life cycle assessment, risk assessment and multi-criteria decision analysis, along with subcategories. The review found that each assessment tool did positively contribute to sustainability assessments, but each also had drawbacks of varying degrees. In particular, multi-criteria decision analysis provides the most relevant tool for conducting a sustainability assessment as it can handle criteria of any typology and provide multiple types of decision recommendations, including rankings, scores and classifications.",

Indium phosphide (InP) QDs emerged as the most promising replacement for cadmium selenide-based QDs for luminescence in the visible range (450\u2013700\u00a0nm). Here, we consider areas of QD synthesis most relevant for future advances in InP. Advances in precursor chemistry, namely single-source precursors, facilitate synthesis of materials with more homogeneous properties. These isolable intermediates have atomically precise structure that introduces a scheme for the atom economy in InP QD synthesis. Methods for obtaining luminescent InP QDs are presented with emphasis on shorter reaction times, fewer steps, and less hazardous reagents. With these advances in luminescence quantum yield (QY), minimization of sample heterogeneity, and enhanced stability, emphasis on reproducibility, safety, and other green chemistry principles can be prioritized.

Peptides precipitated with either diethyl ether and cyclopentyl methyl ether showed identical HPLC profiles. This observation thus indicates that the use of the greener ether is not detrimental for the quality of the final product.

The textile production, which started in the West, gradually moved to low cost developing countries. Inadequate legislation and control in these countries has led to the pollution of the natural water bodies there. The textile industry uses over 8000 chemicals in its supply chain and today faces the challenging demand to move towards cleaner production. NGOs have challenged the industry to achieve the goal of Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals across all pathways by 2020. The industry has taken strong initiatives to address this challenge. In the long term, sustainable chemistry will be the only solution and innovation is the key.",

     "abstract": "Making current chemistry practice sustainable is a relatively new issue in developing countries. The current curricula for chemists' and engineers' education barely consider environmental sustainability as its own component. This make it difficult to train human resources to have consciousness about the implications of synthetizing chemicals with multiple applications while also considering the life cycle of the chemical and its final fate in the environment. For example, during the last Latin American Federation of Chemical Associations meeting in 2016, not a single paper was devoted to sustainable chemistry issues. This paucity is a clear demonstration that educational curricula must progress to include sustainability in order to raise the concern of a new generation of professionals. This issue is also linked to sustainable development goals (SDGs) and that of sustainable production and consumption. One element that may help raise concern of sustainable chemistry may be concentrated in problems that raise public interest, one being plastic pollution initially raised as a marine litter issue, but which is a far more complex problem, since plastic polymers contain a great variety of chemicals that complicate recycling and final disposal, but which brings the opportunity to address the issue of chemicals in the environment through some upstream solutions (i.e., before the plastics can become an environmental concern). Without doubt, we need strong education in chemical synthesis and green chemistry principles to address molecular design and minimize impacts ab initio, in addition to a pursuit of material innovation. It is also necessary to think of customers\u2019 needs, where chemistry meets economy and social sciences, and which can barely be observed in current chemistry and engineering curricula in developing countries. Possible solutions might be generated from an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented perspective.",

This review summarized the photolytic and photocatalytic degradation of UV filters in contaminated water. The findings indicated that limited research has been conducted on the photolysis and photocatalysis of UV filters. Photolysis of UV filters through UV irradiation in natural water was a slow process, which was accelerated by the presence of photosensitisers e.g. triplet state of chromaphoric dissolved organic matter (3CDOM*) and nutrients but reduced by salinity, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and divalent cations. UV Photocatalysis of 4-methylbenzylidene camphor and 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid was very effective with 100% removal within 30\u00a0min and 90\u00a0min using medicated TiO2/H2O2 and TiO2, respectively.

     "abstract": "Metal-halide perovskite semiconductors are certainly one of the hottest topic in solar energy conversion. Optimization of both the absorber material and device architecture has led to an astoundingly rapid increase in the reported device efficiencies. Initially developed in the context of dye-sensitized solar cell research, metal-halide perovskite devices now reach efficiency values and hence need to be compared to more conventional photovoltaic technologies such as silicon, copper indium gallium diselenide and cadmium telluride. Strong direct band gap absorption, long charge carrier diffusion length, ease and flexibility in processing at low temperatures and facile tunability makes these materials ideal for solar energy conversion applications. This review will both reflect on favorable properties of these hybrid and ionic semiconductors as well as reflecting on lead toxicity, material and device stability as the most critical issues that need to be solved in order for these materials to become technologically viable.",

     "abstract": "The conversion of carbon dioxide is vital if we are to avoid the catastrophic consequences that will result from further global temperature rise as a result of burning fossil fuels. Current techniques, such as catalytic conversion and biochemical processes, are each associated with their own drawbacks such as catalyst deactivation and high energy input. Plasma processes are gaining increasing interest as they have the potential to reduce a greater amount of atmospheric environmental pollutants at any one time due to an increased throughput, whilst using a smaller reactor with improved energy efficiency and near-zero emissions. Non-thermal plasma can dissociate stable molecules, such as CO2, at temperatures as low as room temperature. It is this key feature which makes plasma conversion such a promising technology in the conversion and utilisation of CO2. Furthermore, possible products from plasma processes include fuels and chemicals, such as methanol and syngas, which have a high market value; hence potentially making the process feasible on an industrial scale. This paper discusses recent advances in the use of plasma processes for carbon dioxide conversion, along with the future outlook of this technology and the impact these techniques could have on the chemical and energy industries.",

This is based on qualitative and quantitative criteria characterizing the different transformations along supply chains: ranging from the resource deposit to the product and from there into the so-called re-phases or disposal and end-of-life. The trajectories of the resources in real space and time have to be transparent in order to optimize the resource efficiency and its long-ranging compatibility but also to minimize dissipation.
