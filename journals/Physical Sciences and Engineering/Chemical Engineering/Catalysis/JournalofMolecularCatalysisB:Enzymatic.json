     "abstract": "Laccase-catalyzed synthesis of dye molecules represents a green choice to reduce the environmental footprint of conventional synthetic processes. Textile industry will benefit from this green technology since the synthesized dyes can be exploited to colour different fabrics.This work describes the application of the Pleurotus ostreatus POXA1b laccase in polymeric dye synthesis using resorcinol and 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid (2,5-DABSA) as substrates. The potential of the resorcinol/2,5-DABSA coupling route was transferred to a chemical industry, Seta\u015f Colour Center, by introducing a greener synthesis step within the process routinely used for textile dyeing. Dye synthesis was performed at different precursor ratios (1:1 and 1:10 2,5-DABSA: resorcinol) and their dyeing properties were compared on different fibres. The two mixtures of synthesized dyes proved to be effective on nylon and wool, with 1:10 ratio displaying the best performances in terms of dyeing efficiency and colour strength. Good and comparable end quality and \u201cperformances during use\u201d were observed for nylon and wool coloured with both synthesized dyes.",

     "abstract": "Biocatalysis with cytochrome P450 enzymes are important for the industrial production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fragrance and flavor compounds since chemoselective hydroxylation of aromatics and terpenes are chemically difficult to achieve. A few P450 based industrial processes have been developed based on whole cell catalysis. However, the outer membrane of microbial cells forms an effective barrier, which reduces the uptake of hydrophobic substrates. The coexpression of outer membrane proteins in E. coli such as the ferric hydroxamate uptake protein (FhuA) can provide alternative solutions to chemical or physical methods for increasing compound flux through the outer membrane of E. coli and thereby to boost productivities. In this study we employed an engineered FhuA \u03941-160 variant in which the \u201ccork domain\u201d was removed (first 160 residues are deleted); FhuA \u03941-160 has a cross-section of 39\u201346\u00a0\u00c5 with a \u201cfree\u201d inner diameter of about 14 \u00c5 that serves as passive diffusion channel. FhuA WT and \u03941-160 were coexpressed on a bicistronic system with two P450 BM3 variants for regiospecific hydroxylation of aromatic compounds toluene and anisole as well as for oxidation of two terpenes (\u03b1)-pinene and (R)-(+)-limonene. The presence of FhuA \u03941\u2010160 resulted in a doubled product concentration for toluene (35\u00a0\u03bc to 50\u00a0\u03bcM), anisole (25\u00a0\u03bcM to 45\u00a0\u03bcM), pinene (12\u00a0\u03bcM to 20\u00a0\u03bcM) and limonene (12\u00a0\u03bcM to 25\u00a0\u03bcM) and five times higher for the coumarin derivative BCCE. In order to characterizes and compensate for expression variations a quantification method based on Chromeo546-labled StrepTactinII was developed to quantify the number of FhuA \u03941-160 in the outer E. coli membrane (\u223c44000 of FhuA \u03941-160 per cell). Morphology studies showed that a 6% E. coli surface coverage can be achieved with FhuA \u03941\u2010160 without significantly influencing the E. coli rod shape. In summary, FhuA \u03941-160 efficiently increases uptake of hydrophobic aromatics and terpenes for whole-cell biotransformations and can likely be used for other enzymes and/or substrates.",

     "abstract": "Phenylpropanoid glucosides (PPGs) are naturally occurring and bioactive phenolic derivatives, largely distributed in plants. In this work different PPGs have been chemically or enzymatically synthesized from the lignols coniferyl and p-coumaryl alcohols as substrates for a laccase-catalyzed oxidative coupling. The biooxidation of these PPGs has been investigated here and novel dihydrobenzofuran-based structurally modified analogues have been isolated and characterized. Specifically, the presence of a carbohydrate moiety increased the water solubility of these compounds and reduced the number of dimeric products, as pinoresinol-like structures could not be formed. Looking for a possible sugar-promoted stereochemical enrichment of the obtained diastereomeric mixtures of dimers, different carbohydrate moieties (d-glucose, l-glucose and the disaccharide rutinose) were considered and the respective d.e. values of the dimeric products were measured by 1H NMR and HPLC. However, it was found that the sugar substituent had a minor effect on the stereochemical outcome of the radical coupling reactions, the best measured result being a d.e. value of 21%.",

     "abstract": "Besides merely destroying H2O2, an important use of the catalase reaction, H2O2\u00a0\u2192\u00a01/2 O2\u00a0+\u00a0H2O, is to supply O2 to oxygenation reactions. Due to convenient spatiotemporal control over O2 release, oxygenation from H2O2 is useful in particular for enzymatic reactions confined to solid supports. Because commercial catalases are difficult to immobilize, we have developed a one-step procedure of purification and immobilization of Bordetella pertussis catalase, recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli. Fusion of the catalase to a positively charged binding module enabled effective immobilization of the chimeric enzyme on anionic support (Relisorb SP 400), giving a controllable activity loading of between 5000 and 100,000 units/g support. Use of the immobilized catalase in combination with H2O2 feeding provided O2 to the reaction of glucose oxidase in solution for a range of volumetric conversion rates (0.2\u20131.5\u00a0mM/min). Using optical sensing to measure the O2 concentration in the liquid but also in the solid phase, we showed that internal superoxygenation of the support was made possible under these conditions, resulting in an inverted (that is, negative) O2 concentration gradient between the bulk and the particle and allowing the internal O2 concentration to exceed by up to 4-fold the limit of atmospheric-pressure air saturation in solution. By tailored immobilization of B. pertussis catalase, therefore, an efficient biocatalytic system for hydrogen peroxide conversion in porous solid support was developed. This could find application for bubble-free oxygenation of O2-dependent enzymes co-immobilized with the catalase whereby enhanced internal availability of O2 would contribute to biocatalytic reaction intensification.",

Previously, it has been demonstrated that several species of the Aspergillus genus are able to perform selective oxidation of benzopyrans. Isochroman or 3,4-dihydro-1H-benzopyran (1) was chosen as model substrate for the biotransformation since related motifs are often found in the structure of natural products with important biological and pharmacological activities. All the tested strains showed the ability to oxidize 1. Chemodivergent reaction pathways between the employed microorganisms were observed. The use of cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors, and different oxygenation conditions allowed to inquire about the type of enzymes involved in the process. The results obtained were compared with chemical one-electron oxidation of compound 1 and thus, a metabolic pathway was proposed.",

     "abstract": "We have undertaken physicochemical studies of the CO dehydrogenase from the aerobe Oligotropha carboxidovorans, probing both the binuclear Mo- and Cu-containing active site where CO is oxidized to CO2 and the enzyme\u2019s FAD, where the reducing equivalents obtained from CO are transferred to the quinone pool. Regarding the FAD site, we have characterized the semiquinone oxidation state by EPR and identified it to be of the blue neutral form with a linewidth of 20\u00a0G. The signature long-wavelength absorbance of FADH is also observed in the absorption spectrum of partially reduced enzyme at low pH. The enzyme exhibits a pH-dependent absorption spectrum in the oxidized state that is lost upon covalent modification of the enzyme by the flavin-specific agent diphenyliodonium cation. The pH dependence is attributed to Tyr 193 of the FAD-containing CoxM subunit, which sits atop the re face of the isoalloxazine ring in van der Waals contact with it. Electron equilibration among the enzyme\u2019s four redox-active centers (including two [2Fe-2S] clusters in addition to the binuclear center and FAD) is found to be pH-dependent, but too fast to be followed using a stopped-flow pH jump protocol. Electron transfer from the iron-sulfur clusters to the FAD is thus much faster than in other members of the xanthine oxidase family of molybdenum-containing enzymes to which CO dehydrogenase belongs. Finally, a complex of the binuclear center with bicarbonate has been characterized by EPR, where the absence of observed hyperfine coupling using 13C-labeled bicarbonate suggests strongly that the bicarbonate is not directly coordinated to the Mo(V) of the partially reduced binuclear center.",

     "abstract": "Enzymatic production of C\u2013N heteropolymeric dyes at alkaline pHs is an attractive process for the textile industry. In this work, we have designed a fungal laccase by directed evolution so that it may be used at alkaline pHs for the synthesis of C\u2013N heteropolymeric dyes (C\u2013N polydye) from catechol and 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid (2,5-DABSA). Firstly, several medium- and high-redox potential fungal laccases from previous laboratory evolution campaigns were benchmarked for the synthesis of the C\u2013N polydye at pH 8.0, choosing an alkaline laccase mutant from Myceliophthora thermophila as the departure point for further engineering. Mutant libraries were then constructed, expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and screened using a high-throughput colorimetric assay for the detection of the C\u2013N polydye. By combining directed and focused molecular evolution, a novel, strongly expressed alkaline laccase variant was identified. This laccase was secreted at 37\u00a0mg/L and its catalytic efficiency for the oxidation of catechol and 2,5-DABSA at pH 8.0 was enhanced 3.5-fold relative to that of the wild-type, promoting the synthesis of the C\u2013N polydye at basic pHs. While the improved expression was mostly the result of accumulating mutations that favor the yeast\u2019s codon usage together with the recovery of a secretion mutation, the enhanced C\u2013N polydye synthetic activity of the mutant laccase was dependent on the alkaline mutations it inherited. Readily secreted, this laccase mutant would appear to be a valuable platform for organic synthesis at basic pHs.",

     "abstract": "Biocatalytic oxidations can offer clear advantages compared to chemically catalyzed oxidations in terms of chemo, regio and stereoselectivity as well as a reduced environmental impact. One of the most industrially important reactions is the oxidation of alcohols, which can be carried out using alcohol dehydrogenases. However, their effective use requires an effective regeneration of the oxidized nicotinamide cofactor (NAD(P)+), which is critical for the economic feasibility of the process. NAD(P)H oxidase is an enzyme class of particular interest for this cofactor regeneration since it enables the use of molecular oxygen as a substrate, generating either water or hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. The use of these enzymes is now gaining an increased interest, and several different enzymes of both types have been applied for proof-of-concept. In this review, we give an overview of the state-of-the-art, and discuss several important issues for future implementation in a production process.",

We recently demonstrated that the thermotolerant ProDH from Thermus thermophilus (TtProDH) is overproduced in Escherichia coli when using maltose-binding protein (MBP) as a solubility tag. However, MBP-TtProDH and MBP-clipped TtProDH are prone to aggregation through non-native self-association. Here we provide evidence that the hydrophobic N-terminal helix of TtProDH is responsible for the self-association process. The more polar MBP-tagged F10E/L12E variant exclusively forms tetramers and exhibits excellent catalytic features over a wide range of temperatures.

     "abstract": "p-Hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) can be derived from the biodegradation of lignin or from man-made compounds. The pathway involved for HPA degradation has been characterized for several species, but little is known on the degradation of HPA in Acinetobacter sp. In this report, the HPA degradation operon in A. baumannii TH was investigated using genome walking and PCR amplification to identify the genes encoded by the operon. The results showed that there are thirteen ORFs that are involved in this process and their arrangement in the operon of A. baumannii TH is different from that in the operons of other previously reported species. ORFs 8-12 show clear variation compared to orthologous genes from other species, particularly at ORF9 which encodes for succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) that is absent in other species. The ssadh gene was overexpressed and the results confirmed that this enzyme is indeed succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. The results suggest that the final metabolites in this pathway are pyruvate and succinate, different from other species which have pyruvate and succinic semialdehyde as final products. Functional studies of the proteins encoded by ORF 8 and 10-12 have confirmed their roles in the HPA degradation pathway as an aldolase, a transporter protein, a hydroxylase and a reductase. Analysis of the sequence similarity network of enzymes encoded by ORFs 8-12 has revealed several interesting features. The designation of enzymes homologous to the oxygenase component of p-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase in the database should be reassigned, as they were mostly incorrectly assigned as acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. An understanding of the enzymatic reactions which convert aromatic compounds into pyruvate and succinate should be highly useful for future metabolic engineering for converting waste-derived aromatic compounds into useful biochemicals.",

It showed that in addition to a single distal histidine with a suitable distance to the heme iron (Phe43 to His43 mutation), a second distal histidine (Leu29 to His29 mutation) can work cooperatively to increase the turnover number, mimicking the role of well-known His-Arg pair in native peroxidases. Moreover, a channel created to the heme pocket by removal of the native His64 gate (His64 to Ala64 mutation) was shown to facilitate the binding of substrate, resulting in enhanced catalytic efficiency for the triple mutant L29H/F43H/H64A\u00a0Mb, which is beyond the addition of both double mutants, L29H/H64A Mb and F43H/H64A\u00a0Mb.

The ratio between the isolated products varied widely even between similar substrates, e.g. o-cresol, m-cresol and p-cresol. These differences are caused by different binding interactions within the active site of TDO. This study provides insight into the binding interactions by molecular docking using AutoDock tools. The nature of binding of phenolic substrates was of major interest, in order to explain the observed regio- and stereo-selectiviy of product formation. The ellipse-shaped binding pocket of TDO consists of a polar and a hydrophobic region, limiting the possible substrate orientations. The phenolic hydroxyl group was preferentially hydrogen bonded with Gln-215 and His-311 in the active site. In some cases, a hydrogen bond was formed with other amino acids, e.g. Asp-219 and Met-220, instead. The position and type of the substituent on the phenol ring influences the formation of transient intermediates, and thus the nature and stability of the major isolated product.",

It was known that dimer form was considered to be active and monomer form has inactive conformation. However, there are no evidences at the molecular levels for Glucose oxidase (GOx) inactivation through dissociation. Here, using molecular dynamic simulation, it has been investigated for the first time that why dimer form of the enzyme is active. We have performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations at different forms of GOx (monomer and dimer with and without FAD cofactor). The analysis of tertiary structure showed that monomer is more unstable and has more deviation from the crystal structure. In contrast, dimer has a stable conformation during simulation. These results are in good agreement with experimental data about enzyme inactivation by dissociation. It was also found that when FAD is removed from monomer, it became more unstable in comparison with monomer containing cofactor. This shows essential role of FAD in both activity and stability of the enzyme. According to the MD simulation, enzyme inactivation is associated with changing in secondary structure at the interface. Interestingly, it was found that some secondary structures are destructed while some structures are formed in monomer upon dissociation. The analysis of active site structure during simulation revealed that both dissociation and release of the FAD influence on inactivation of GOx. This study provided novel insight to understand the mechanism of enzyme inactivation upon dissociation, which would be useful for rational enzyme design.",

Immobilized MAS1 lipase was found to have no regiospecificity and be a more suitable catalyst for the glycerolysis of n-3 PUFA-rich EE compared with other enzymes. Higher TAG content (73.9%) and EE conversion (82%) were obtained by immobilized MAS1 lipase than those by Novozym 435 (29.6% and 54.8%, respectively) and Lipozyme RM IM (10% and 49%, respectively). Besides, the effects of temperature, enzyme loading and n-3 PUFA-rich EE/glycerol molar ratio on TAG content were evaluated using response surface methodology. The results showed that temperature, enzyme loading and n-3 PUFA-rich EE/glycerol molar ratio had significant effects on TAG content. The maximum TAG content (76.5%) was achieved under the optimal conditions (enzyme loading of 163.8\u00a0U/g substrate, n-3 PUFA-rich EE/glycerol molar ratio of 4.13:1 at 65\u00a0\u00b0C). Subsequently, the glycerolysis reaction mixtures were further purified by molecular distillation and highly pure n-3 PUFA-rich TAG (96.2%) with similar fatty acids composition to the substrate (EE) was obtained in the final products. In addition, the obtained final products had low acid value and peroxide value (0.03\u00a0mg KOH/g and 3.2\u00a0meq/kg, respectively).

However, we show that this perturbed architecture is unable to retain the high activity-conformation for further rounds of catalysis.

HWP of 180\u00a0\u00b0C, 20\u00a0min and SP of 121\u00a0\u00b0C, 20\u00a0min showed similar performance for sugar release from PKC.

When HWP pretreated PKC was further hydrolyzed with enzyme cocktail (cellulase, xylanase, endo-mannanase), 45% of PKC was solubilized compared with the control. The manno-oligosaccharides produced by HWP and SP were converted to mannose and mannobiose by endo-mannanase.

     "abstract": "The thermal stabilization of enzymes is a critical factor in the development and reliability of enzyme-based processes and functional materials. Using a simple amine coupling approach for enzyme immobilization onto magnetic microbeads, followed by encasement of the beads in a hydrogel, we demonstrate that the thermal stability of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase can be increased dramatically. For example, when free and microbead-immobilized enzyme (\u201cEM Conjugate\u201d) are incubated overnight in a dry state at 63\u00a0\u00b0C (140\u00a0\u00b0F), the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the latter is higher than the former by six orders of magnitude (a factor of 2.16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106). This effect arises mostly through a \u223c29,700-fold decrease in Km experienced by the EM Conjugate, relative to that of the free enzyme. Encapsulation of the EM Conjugate in a hydrogel based on poly(N-(3-aminopropyl methacrylamide)), which contains a primary amine, affords the enzyme additional stability when incubated overnight at 63\u00a0\u00b0C in an aqueous state. For example, its catalytic efficiency is four orders of magnitude higher than that of both the free enzyme (a factor of 4.34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104) and that of the EM Conjugate alone (a factor of 1.78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104) after all are incubated overnight at 63\u00a0\u00b0C. The presence of the hydrogel also caused the Michaelis constant to decrease by 1.38\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 relative to that of the EM Conjugate, reaching a value of 2.18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0M. Thus the hydrogel enables the AChE substrate binding site to retain a significant amount of its natural affinity for the substrate, after heating. This effect may occur via ion-pairing by the primary amines in the hydrogel polymer repeat unit, which are protonated and positively-charged at the assay pH. To the best of our knowledge, this simple method for enzyme thermal stabilization is novel and has not yet been investigated.",

Mesoporous fibrous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) were synthesized with particles size 200\u00a0nm pore size 15\u201330\u00a0nm; followed by amino-functionalization. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmittance Electronic microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and N2 adsorption were used for the characterization of nanoparticles. Further SiO2@NH2 nanoparticles were activated by glutaraldehyde as a bifunctional cross linker, and were used for lipase immobilization. The applied approach for support preparation, activation, and optimization of immobilization conditions, led to better resistance to temperature and pH inactivation in comparison to the free lipase, and hence widened the reaction pH and temperature regions, with the optimum pH and temperature of 7.5 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The immobilized Lipase Candida Ragusa (ICRL) maintained above 81% of the initial activity after 28\u00a0days and 80% activity after 8 repeated cycles.

A novel \u03b1\u2013RHA activity was identified in the crude extract of Novosphingobium sp. PP1Y, a marine bacterium able to grow on a wide range of aromatic polycyclic compounds. In this work, this \u03b1-RHA activity was isolated from the native microorganism and the corresponding orf was identified in the completely sequenced and annotated genome of strain PP1Y. The coding gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, strain BL21(DE3), and the recombinant protein, rRHA-P, was purified and characterized as an inverting monomeric glycosidase of ca. 120\u00a0kDa belonging to the GH106 family. A biochemical characterization of this enzyme using pNPR as substrate was performed, which showed that rRHA-P had a moderate tolerance to organic solvents, a significant thermal stability up to 45\u00a0\u00b0C and a catalytic efficiency, at pH 6.9, significantly higher than other bacterial \u03b1-RHAs described in literature.

     "abstract": "In this work, we explored the activation of a lipoprotein lipase from Burkholderia species by glucose-headed surfactants (GHSs) for enhancing its catalytic activity in organic solvent. Three GHSs were prepared and then tested as the additives for inducing the activation of lipoprotein lipase. The kinetic parameters of GHS-treated lipoprotein lipase were determined for the hydrolysis or alcoholysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. It was found that GHS-treated lipoprotein lipase was 4 to 5 orders of magnitude more active than its native counterpart in organic solvent. Such a dramatic activity enhancement was largely the result of a huge increase in the turnover frequency kcat. Surprisingly, the kcat values in organic solvent were one order of magnitude greater than their aqueous counterparts. As a result, the kcat/Km of GHS-treated lipoprotein lipase in organic solvent became comparable to the aqueous level within one order of magnitude. We thus have demonstrated for the first time that a lipase can display nearly aqueous-like activity in organic solvent. As an illustrative application of GHS-treated lipoprotein lipase, we performed the dynamic kinetic resolution of two secondary alcohols, which provided the products of high enantiopurity (98\u201399%ee) with high yields (90\u201391%).",

Since the wild type enzyme has an optimum temperature stability at 50\u00a0\u00b0C, the improvement of its stability will widen its application in industries with operating processes at higher temperatures. A library containing approximately 5000 afxynG1 mutants was generated and thermally screened at 60\u00b0\u00a0C for 30\u00a0min. Four mutants (T16A/T39I/L176Q, S68R, A60D and Q47P/S159R) were selected for enzymatic characterization because of their higher catalytic activity compared to the wild type. Among these mutants, the mutant T16A/T39I/L176Q showed highest stability at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and retained 45.9% of its activity after 60\u00a0min of incubation while the wild type had lost its activity completely after 50\u00a0min of incubation. The other mutants, A60D, S68R and Q47P/S159R also showed improvement in thermostability by retaining 33.2%, 25.8% and 23.8% of their activity respectively. The optimum temperature for mutants also significantly increased. The optimum temperature for T16A/T39I/L176Q increased up to 70\u00a0\u00b0C, followed by A60D increased up to 60\u00a0\u00b0C while the rest remained the same, similar to the wild type enzyme. The mutant T16A/T39I/L176Q had the highest half-life time (t1/2) of 42\u00a0min at 70\u00b0\u00a0C, which is a 3.5-fold increase compared to the wild type enzyme which only showed a t1/2 of 12\u00a0min at 70\u00a0\u00b0C.

In an effort to explore the feasibility of converting a cold-active esterase from Monascus ruber (Lip10) into a cold-active lipase, an Y264F variant in which the salt bridge between K243 and Y264 was disrupted has been constructed and characterized. The interfacial kinetic parameter, Kmapp for pNP-laurate (C12) and pNP-palmitate (C16), of Lip10 esterase was 4.2 and 5.7 times higher than those of the Y264F variant, respectively. Substrate specificity of the Y264F variant changed from shot-chain length substrate to medium- and long-chain length substrates, indicating that the Y264F variant turned into a lipase. Meanwhile, the Y264F variant displayed 48.6% maximum activity at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 3.2\u00a0kcal/mol activation energy in the range of 5\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting that it was still cold-active. Based on analysis of the structure-function relationships, it suggests that the shape of substrate channel controlled by the conserved salt bridge was very important for the substrate specificity. This study provides a way to alter the substrate preference of the Lip10 esterase as well as new insight into the structural basis of esterase substrate specificity.",

     "abstract": "Biotransformation of lignocellulose by microbial fermentation is usually preceded by thermo-chemical pretreatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. Derivatives formed during the pretreatment of the lignocellulosic biomass inhibit enzymatic hydrolysis as well as microbial fermentation. Pretreated lignocellulose hydrolysate contains many derivatives of either furanic or phenolic inhibitory derivatives. In the present study, laccase was used to detoxify three different types of lignocellulosic derivatives that are highly toxic to microbial fermentation due to their low hydrophilic nature, namely furfural, acetosyringone, and coniferyl aldehyde. A minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test was carried out with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The MIC of furfural, acetosyringone, and coniferyl aldehyde was 12\u00a0mM, 24\u00a0mM, and 1.5\u00a0mM, respectively. Laccase was immobilized on to cellulose nanofiber produced by Gluconacetobacter xylinus. Immobilized laccase showed a better pH and thermal stability than free laccase. Reuse of immobilized laccase retains 85% of its enzyme activity after 16 recycles. Immobilized laccase completely degraded the three lignocellulose inhibitory derivatives after 36\u00a0h of incubation at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Finally, the degradation was confirmed by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013VIS spectrum), high performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Interestingly, it was found that the effect of enzymatic degradation depends on the structural variation of the lignocellulosic derivatives as laccase alone detoxified the furfural and coniferyl aldehyde, whereas a redox mediator HOBt was needed for the detoxification of ketone based lignin derivative acetosyringone.",

The study included analysis of pH dependency of the catalase reaction and H2O2 mediated enzyme inactivation as well as experiments on the influence of a second substrate on the course of catalase reaction. Apparent kinetic parameters (Km, kcat) for the catalase activity of UPOs were determined. Inactivation of UPOs by H2O2 is discussed with regard to O2 production and remaining UPO activity. Furthermore formation of biliverdin as heme destruction product was demonstrated along with the formation of UPO compound III as a possible intermediate that forces the destruction process. Radical trapping experiments with methyl benzoate gave indication for the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the presence of excess H2O2. Eventually, a plausible pathway of heme destruction has been proposed, proceeding via UPO compound III and subsequent hydroxyl radical formation, which in turn may cause heme bleaching and verdoheme and biliverdin formation.",

     "abstract": "We have successfully obtained a recombinant xylanase by fusing with elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), the xylanase SoxB underwent a sharp irreversible phase transition, and self-assembled into an insoluble but more catalytically operative particle. This was analogous to the immobilized xylanase to a large extent and aroused our interest to gain new insights into the determinant factor that may cause this phenomenon. We herein listed several candidate factors including the length of ELPs, linker sequence, buffer properties, and the target protein, subsequently we evaluated their contributions to the formation of the active aggregates. The results suggested that SoxB was fused with ELPs as desired protein partners, neither ELPs length nor the linker type made crucial contribution to the formation of active aggregates. However, when Na2CO3 was chosen as the salt to trigger the phase transition, the catalytic activities detected in aggregates accounted for more than 87.7% of total activity, whereas above 83.8% of the activity remained in supernatant when using Na2SO4. Then we introduced an alkali-tolerant xylanase termed as Xyl and compared it with SoxB, and found that the activity ratio in insoluble particle dropped to 15.3% in Na2CO3 and 19.3% in Na2SO4 respectively, only a few insoluble aggregates observed during the purification. Therefore, we speculated the property of xylanase partner fused to ELPs should be the predominant factor to form the catalytically active insoluble aggregates, and this provides a promising not yet reported perspective for industrial application of \u201cimmobilized\u201d SoxB.",

Two methods 1. Entrapment in a thin calcium alginate coating and 2. Direct sorption, were used to immobilize the enzyme. The three different plasma treatments for surface activation of PET nonwovens were: 1. Air atmospheric DBD plasma, 2. Cold remote plasma-CRP with 100% N2 and 3.- CRP with a mixture of N2/O2 gases. Plasma treatment of the PET fiber surface increased the quantity of immobilized enzyme using the entrapment method, and the degree of alginate film cross-linking highly influenced the enzyme activity. Highest enzyme activity was reached for the PET treated with air atmospheric plasma and cross-linked with 0.25\u00a0g/l of CaCl2. With the direct sorption method, greater amounts of enzyme were immobilized as compared to the entrapment method, but a considerable proportion of enzyme lost their catalytic activity. Only with the CRP N2/O2 plasma treatment, up to 90% of sorbed enzyme maintained their activity. Reusability study showed that for the optimized entrapment method, a progressive decrease in activity was observed after each use cycle. With the optimized sorption method using N2/O2 CRP plasma, no decrease in enzyme activity was detected, and the immobilized enzyme could be used over more than 15 cycles.",

Several amino acids located at the substrate channel and active sites are known to be important for the catalytic activity of CYP102A1. The L188 residue at the C-terminus of \u03b1-helix F undergoes a large shift upon substrate binding and has frequently been found in different combinations of multiple mutations showing enhanced and altered activities.

The mutants were made with site-directed mutagenesis and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzymatic properties of the mutants for a set of fatty acids (C10-C16) were compared to the properties of the wild-type. L188Q and L188\u00a0P mutants showed especially strong increases in hydroxylase activity toward C10-C13 fatty acids, although they did not have activity changes for C14-C16 fatty acids. Although most mutants showed very similar overall hydroxylation rates for myristic acid, 14 mutants showed apparent changes in the regioselectivity of hydroxylation with a preference for the \u03c9-3 position over the \u03c9-1 position.

     "abstract": "Numerous state-of-the-art technologies and new types of carriers have been developed recently to improve enzyme immobilization. Cross-linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) technology is a lucrative prospect, as several robust biocatalysts have been generated using this simple method of carrier-free immobilization with the possibility of using semipurified enzyme. However, the low lysine content in the enzyme remains a challenge for effective crosslinking. In this work, maghemite (\u03b3- Fe2O3), a recently sought after nanoparticle, was silanized with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) for use in the preparation of cross-linked enzyme aggregates of recombinant xylanase from Trichoderma reesei (Xyl-CLEA-silanized maghemite). Prior screening revealed ethanol to be the best precipitant, and a 0.2: 1 (v:v) glutaraldehyde to enzyme ratio was essential to form active CLEAs. The Xyl-CLEA-silanized maghemite succeeded in increasing the activity recovery 1.66- and 1.5-fold compared to conventional Xyl-CLEAs and Xyl-CLEA-BSA, respectively. The silanization of maghemite with APTES was proven feasible when a 0.0075:1 (v:v) maghemite to enzyme ratio was able to achieve a 78% activity recovery of the xylanase aggregates, whereas the non-silanized maghemite only achieved a 47% activity recovery. At an elevated temperature of 60\u00a0\u00b0C, Xyl-CLEA-silanized maghemite retained approximately 50% of its initial activity, compared to the free enzyme, for which the activity recovery had plummeted to 20%. Conversely, Xyl-CLEA suffered a total loss of activity at this temperature, whereas Xyl-CLEA-BSA retained only a 6% activity. Xyl-CLEA-silanized maghemite also successfully retained more than 50% of its activity after up to 6 cycles, whereas Xyl-CLEA retained approximately 10% of its initial activity after only 5 cycles. The surface morphology, particle size and loading of silanized maghemite were confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The combination of the effective surface modification, high enzyme activity recovery, improved stability and enhanced reusability of Xyl-CLEA-silanized maghemite presents an attractive process for xylanase immobilization and provides a promising catalyst for the biomass industry.",

     "abstract": "In order to remove the residual lactose in crude galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), different commercial soluble \u03b2-galactosidases from Kluyveromyces lactis (Lactozym Pure 6500L, Maxilact L2000, Lactase NL and Biolactasa-NL) and reaction conditions (temperature, total carbohydrate concentration and enzyme:substrate mass ratio) were evaluated. To select the best biocatalyst, the hydrolytic activity on o-NPG and thermal stability of all enzymes were evaluated in the absence and presence of three cations (Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+) at different concentrations. The enzyme source, cation and cation concentration were selected to obtain the highest hydrolytic activity and thermal stability. Then lactose hydrolysis of raw GOS was assessed varying the temperature (30\u00a0\u00b0C\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C), total carbohydrate concentration (10%-50%) and enzyme:substrate mass ratio (50\u00a0IU\u00a0g\u22121\u2013400\u00a0IU\u00a0g\u22121) and considering the lactose percentage decrease as response parameter (DL). Lactase NL was selected as the best enzyme, with a hydrolytic activity of 286\u00a0IU\u00a0mg\u22121 and a half-life of 9\u00a0h at 35\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of 1\u00a0mM Mn2+. The best reaction conditions for lactose hydrolysis employing the selected enzyme were 35\u00a0\u00b0C, 50% initial carbohydrate concentration and 135\u00a0IU\u00a0g\u22121. At such conditions of lactose hydrolysis, 70% reduction of lactose in raw GOS was obtained, with an increase of 48% in monosaccharides and of 30% in GOS. This pre-hydrolytic step is a key aspect for the subsequent purification of GOS by nanofiltration or selected bioconversion, in which monosaccharides can be removed efficiently producing GOS of high purity.",

     "abstract": "Stabilization of multimeric enzymes is one of the major challenges in biocatalysis since dissociation of subunits can inactivate the enzyme. Particularly, catalase that breaks down hydrogen peroxide in water and molecular oxygen is an enzyme difficult to stabilize by conventional immobilization techniques, because it is a tetrameric structure containing Fe-protoporphyrin IX in its active site. Cross-linking of enzyme aggregates is a methodology that can overcome this bottleneck, but diffusional delay of mass transport within the particles is a recurrent drawback. In this work, cross-linked aggregates of catalase from bovine liver were prepared, evaluating the influence of precipitant and cross-linking agents, as well as bovine serum albumin (BSA) as feeder protein on the catalytic properties, thermal stability, and mass transport resistance of the derivatives. The most active derivatives were prepared using ammonium sulfate as precipitant agent, 50\u00a0mM glutaraldehyde as cross-linker, and mass ratio BSA/catalase of 3.0. These derivatives in the absence of diffusive effects showed recovered activity of 98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7% and high stability at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 7.0 (\u223c80% of the initial activity was recovery after 200\u00a0h under these conditions). The co-precipitation of BSA together with catalase reduced the size of clusters suggesting a decrease of diffusive effects within the biocatalyst. Empirical kinetic model was fitted to the experimental data of initial rate vs. substrate concentration and used to make a comparative analysis of mass transfer into derivatives with and without BSA. Results suggested that the main effect that differentiates the free enzyme and the two derivatives analyzed was of diffusive nature. In fact, the effectiveness factor of the cross-linked aggregates of catalase with BSA increased around 4 times. Statistical design of experiments and the analysis of the response surface methodology showed that the immobilization did not alter the conditions of maximum activity of the catalase, which were found to be 30\u00a0\u00b0C and pH \u223c7.0 for all biocatalysts.",

The 12 biocatalysts were utilized in the production of esters using tributyrin and 20% (v/v) methanol, ethanol or isopropanol via a kinetically controlled strategy. All preparations produced the desired ester, except RML, TLL and LU for isopropyl butyrate. CALA showed the best performance in these reactions, with maximum yields over 40%. The immobilization on heterofunctional supports usually reduced the activity and even the maximum yields, although some exceptions were relevant (e.g., CALA or CALB in the production of ethyl butyrate). The effect of the nucleophile was also very different using the just physically adsorbed or the covalently immobilized preparations, some instances one preparation has as best substrate an alcohol while the best substrate was other alcohol using the other lipase preparation.Using CALB as model enzyme, we have shown the advantages of the use of the covalent preparation. The increase of the alcohol permitted the increase in maximum ester yields. However, the combined presence of dibutyrin and alcohol prevented the reuse of OC-CALB due to the enzyme desorption, while the covalent preparation could be reused by 6 cycles.",

     "abstract": "Enzymes are biocatalysts with huge potential for industry because they have specific catalytic properties, are easy to produce, and are environmentally friendly. These biocatalysts are remarkable molecules for use in the field of bioprocessing technology. However, for certain biocatalytic processes, native enzymes do not meet the requirements for large-scale application; therefore, their natural properties need to be modulated. Another consideration is that the current global demands of the biotechnology industry require increasing productivity of processes and reduction of costs. In this context, enzyme immobilization can be a low-cost approach to the development of more robust and resistant systems to industrial conditions. Immobilized enzymes provide greater stability, sensitivity, and catalytic activity, than free enzymes do, in addition to improved purification processes and the potential for reuse of the enzymes. Among different classes of enzymes, holocellulases are important because they have a broad application spectrum in key industries, such as food, textiles, and biofuels, which are billion-dollar industries. We compiled recent reports of holocellulase immobilization achieved using different techniques, with the focus on the production of bioethanol, a product with growing global demand. In this review, we discuss the concept of immobilization, immobilization techniques, and the state of the art with respect to immobilized holocellulases. We also discuss recent trends in immobilization for second-generation ethanol production and future prospects for industrial applications of immobilized enzymes.",

With the aid of FESEM, BET and BJH analysis, the effect of glutaraldehyde on porosity of chitosan was evaluated. It was observed that the total surface area and pore volume of the carrier were significantly improved by addition of glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agent. The surface area exposure and pore volume were substantially increased (both by 4.4 folds). In addition, distribution of enzyme on the carrier was illustrated by fluorescence image. The characteristics of the immobilized lipases such as immobilization efficiency, enzyme activity, pH stability, thermal stability, reusability, storage stability and enzyme leakage were evaluated. In kinetic studies of enzyme, Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetic coefficients of the hydrolytic activity for the immobilized lipase were defined using Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot. The low value of ionization constant, Km (\u223c0.008\u00a0mM) and high value of specific rate, Vmax(\u223c200\u00a0\u03bcM/ml.min) indicate strong affinity and high activity of enzyme.

The obtained immobilized SMG1-F278N was characterized and its application in synthesis of partial glycerides was evaluated. The immobilization was best achieved by an initial buffer pH of 6.0, an ionic strength of 1.5\u00a0mol/L and a lipase/support ratio of 20\u00a0mg/g. Several analytical approaches such as Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy showed that SMG1-F278N was successfully immobilized onto ECR8285. Besides, the properties of immobilized SMG1-F278N were investigated and it was shown that immobilized SMG1-F278N improved their performance in wider ranges of pH and temperature. It was interesting that the thermostability of immobilized SMG1-F278N was improved significantly relative to the free SMG1-F278N. Moreover, the immobilized SMG1-F278N was employed to synthesis of partial glycerides [diacylglycerol (DAG), monoacylglycerol (MAG)] via esterification of oleic acids and glycerol. High yield (79%) of partial glycerides was obtained and it was observed that high substrate molar ratio of glycerol to oleic acids contributes to the conversion of oleic acids as well as the accumulation of MAG. The immobilized SMG1-F278N was quite stable and can be reused for 7 cycles without significant loss in activity (2%). The obtained results demonstrated that the immobilized SMG1-F278N is a prospective enzyme in oils and fats industry.",

In present study, \u03b2-glucosidases were investigated for their activities under high glucose and cellobiose concentrations. \u03b2-glucosidases recognizes cellobiose a true substrate and hydrolyzes it resulting in glucose or transglycosylates it to give cellotriose. Our observation highlight that rates of reaction for cellotriose synthesis and glucose formation are mainly concentration driven and are dynamically adjusted based on cellobiose concentration in the reaction system.

A 4.0\u00a0kb DNA fragment from QE-9 containing a full length esterase encoding gene was cloned and analyzed. Multiple sequence alignment showed that the esterase gene estqe encoded a 382 amino acid protein that contained the conserved S-X-X-K esterase motif and clustered within esterase family VIII, owning to a lack of beta-lactamase activity. Full-length estqe was amplified by PCR and cloned into plasmid pET-29a for functional expression in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The purified recombinant esterase EstQE converted QE to quizalofop acid (QA) at an optimum temperature and pH of 45\u00a0\u00b0C and 8.0, respectively. Enzyme activity was severely inhibited by Cu2+, whereas, Ca2+ and Mg2+ significantly increased enzyme activity to 142 and 122% of the control, respectively. The inhibitors PMSF, pCMB, and DEPC as well as detergent SDS strongly inhibited esterase activity.

     "abstract": "The oligosaccharide-producing multifunctional amylase (OPMA-N) has both hydrolytic and transglycosyl activities. Our previous reports demonstrated that the function and catalytic versatility of OPMA-N is closely related to its oligomerization, and its oligomeric state is affected by several conserved residues, such as Trp358, and by the cooperation of its small, noncatalytic N-terminal module and the catalytic module. We have demonstrated that the residue Trp358 exposed on the surface of OPMA-N molecule and has an obvious impact on OPMA-N oligomerization mainly by the charge effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of module recombination on the functional integration of OPMA-N. A series of module recombinants of the N-terminal and catalytic modules revealed that the intramolecular, semi-intramolecular and semi-intermolecular interactions of the N-terminal module with two or more catalytic modules enhanced the substrate affinity of the catalytic modules and facilitated the transglycosyl activity and functional integration of the enzyme by mediating positive cooperativity between the catalytic modules. Free N-terminal module alone did not contribute to these effects. Based on the results of this study, we speculated that the substrate affinity, but not the maximal catalytic activity, was the primary driving force in the natural evolution of enzymes, and that molecules of natural or modular enzymes may have occupied some evolutionary spaces that could be expanded or exhumed through module recombination to increase their overall catalytic efficacies or eventual catalytic efficiencies. All of the results in this study could be applied to integration of enzyme function and for creation of novel enzymes.

     "abstract": "A chitosanolytic activity found in a commercial \u03b1-amylase from Bacillus amylolyquefaciens (BAN) was covalently immobilized onto glyoxal agarose beads (25% recovery of activity) and assessed for the continuous production of chitooligosaccharides (COS). The immobilization did not change the reaction profile (with chitotriose and chitobiose as major products, using chitosans of different polymerization and deacetylation degrees), but significantly increased the enzyme thermostability. A two-step process was proposed, in which chitosan was first hydrolyzed in a batch reactor to a viscosity that could flow through a packed-bead reactor (PBR), thus avoiding clogging of the column. The relationship between hydrolysis degree of chitosan (1% w/v) and viscosity of the solution was assessed in a batch reactor. A 50% hydrolyzed chitosan did not cause any clogging of the PBR. Under these conditions, the productivity of the PBR at the lowest dilution rate was 37\u00a0gCOS\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121, with a conversion yield of 73%. In contrast, at the highest dilution rate, the productivity was nearly 200\u00a0gCOS\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121, but the conversion yield dropped to around 40%.",

     "abstract": "The present review deals with current advances in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of biologically important nucleoside analogues (NA), either by the use of microorganisms or enzymes as biocatalysts. The interest in exploiting these biocatalysts is constantly increasing nowadays because of the advantages they have with respect to classic organic chemistry synthesis, such as a fewer number of synthesis steps, an improved chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity, high catalytic efficiency, and simple subsequent processing. Besides, this technology offers an environmentally friendly alternative in comparison with synthetic chemistry. Thus, the present article gives a brief outline of emerging methodologies for the biosynthesis of NAs commonly used in cancer therapies, such as cladribine, clofarabine, nelarabine, fludarabine, decitabine, cytarabine and floxuridine, and as antivirals: ribavirin, iduviran, vidarabine, acyclovir, lamivudine and emtricitabine from microbial or enzymatic sources, and their potential applications in the biotechnology industry. Also, it points highlights the importance of subsequent modifications of nucleoside analogues by different enzymes used as biocatalysts in order to improve the pharmacological properties of the existing drugs. Moreover, the importance of biocatalyst immobilization for industrial applications is considered.",

For this purpose, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed polymerization of a multifunctional monomer, 7-amino-4-hydroxy-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid (AHNAPSA) was carried out by using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant at room temperature for 24\u00a0h under air. The structure of poly(7-amino-4-hydroxy-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid), (PAHNAPSA) was identified by using nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and ultraviolet-visible. Further characterization was performed by means of gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cyclic voltammetry (CV), photoluminescence (PL), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and solid state conductivity measurements. The spectral analysis results exhibited functional group selective polymerization of the monomer containing a multi-active center. Solvent effects on the optical, electrochemical and photo physical properties of PAHNAPSA were investigated by using five different solvents. PAHNAPSA presented an irreversible redox characterization at different scan rates. Optical band gap of PAHNAPSA is also found in the range of 3.18\u2009eV to 3.55\u2009eV. The fluorescence measurements were utilized to investigate the photochemical behaviors of PAHNAPSA in selected polar solvents. Accordingly, PAHNAPSA surprisingly presented multicolor emission behavior with relatively high quantum yield in all selected solvents. In addition, PAHNAPSA presented a reversible pH-responsive behavior and also had high selectivity and sensitivity towards chromium ions. Finally, the kinetic parameters associated with the solid state thermal degradation of PAHNAPSA were calculated from isoconversional methods. The TG/DTG analysis showed that PAHNAPSA followed a diffusion controlled degradation mechanism in N2.",

Alternatively, LIPB was immobilized on SBA-15-APTES-DVS at pH 10.2 and the biocatalyst was named SBA-15-APTES-DVS-LIPB-pH10. The different biocatalysts were assayed to check the effect of the immobilization strategies on the stability and in the substrate specificity during the kinetic resolution of (R,S)-Phenylethyl acetate. The thermal stability of some new preparations were higher than LIPB adsorbed on SBA-15 (SBA-15-LIPB) and LIPB immobilized on Glyoxyl-agarose. High conversions in the enzymatic kinetic resolution were obtained (43\u201350%) for all biocatalysts studied. Regarding activity and stability, the SBA-15-APTES-DVS-LIPB-pH10 was the most successful strategy, since, in first cycle, the maximum conversion was obtained (50%), and the biocatalyst remained active and enantioselective even after five successive cycles.",

The activity of dextran AfMGL conjugates was 50% of the free MGL that consistent with the extent of occupied surface reactive amino groups. The accessibility of reactive \u03b5-amino groups on dextran AfMGL surface was reduced by 70% normalizing to free enzyme. The thermal stability of dextran AfMGL was increased by two folds over the free enzyme. The dextran AfMGL had a higher resistance to proteinase K, retaining about 70% of its initial activity comparing to 20% to the native enzyme after 30\u00a0min of proteolysis at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The in vivo half-life time of dextran modified AfMGL in New Zealand rabbits was increased by 2.3 folds comparing to free enzyme. The in vitro anticancer activity of the free and modified AfMGL was evaluated against five tumor cell lines (MCF-7, HEPG-2, HCT, PC3, HEP-2). The activity of AfMGL towards the tested tumor cells was significantly increased upon dextran conjugation suggesting the dramatic increasing of MGL hydrophilicity and catalytic efficiency.

     "abstract": "In this study we provide the first biochemical characterization of a bacterial pyranose 2-oxidase (AsP2Ox) from Arthrobacter siccitolerans. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of several aldopyranoses at the C-2 position, coupling it to the reduction of dioxygen to hydrogen peroxide. Pyranose 2-oxidases belong to the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family. A structural model based on the known X-ray structure of P2Ox from Phanerochaete chrysosporium supports that AsP2Ox shares structural features with well-characterized fungal P2Oxs. The gene coding for AsP2Ox was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme is a 64-kDa monomer containing a non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, distinct features as compared with fungal counterparts that are \u223c 270\u00a0kDa homotetramers with covalent-linked FAD. AsP2Ox exhibits a redox potential of \u221250\u00a0mV, an optimum temperature of 37\u00a0\u00b0C and an optimum pH at 6.5. AsP2Ox oxidizes d-glucose at the highest efficiency, using additionally d-galactose, d-xylose, l-arabinose and d-ribose as electron donors, coupling their oxidation to the reduction of both dioxygen and 1,4-benzoquinone. AsP2Ox shows a relatively low thermal stability with a melting temperature (Tm) of 43\u00a0\u00b0C and a half-life (t1/2) at 40\u00a0\u00b0C of 25\u00a0min.

     "abstract": "Presently the production and use of biodiesel is not cost-effective in comparison to traditional fossil fuels. Naturally occurring enzymes, such as lipases and esterases, can potentially be engineered to lower the cost of certain steps in the biodiesel synthesis process that would otherwise be more costly. However, these enzymes have evolved to perform biologically relevant functions, and not necessarily to manufacture biodiesel under commercially viable conditions. To this end, we have identified, cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized two proteins from the staphylococcal lipase family that are capable of catalyzing the formation of fatty acid alkyl esters. In an effort to explore strategies for improving these fatty acid modifying enzymes (FAMEs), we have engineered a chimeric fusion protein that significantly increases the esterification of free fatty acid with ethanol. The fusion protein, which consists of a staphylococcal FAME fused to a Drosophila ethanol binding protein, demonstrably improves the rate of catalysis by providing an additional substrate binding site and concomitant increase in the local concentration of substrate. This results in greater overall substrate (ethanol) residence in proximity to the catalytic domain, and a faster rate of catalysis, without the necessity of altering the amino acid sequence of the FAME protein.",

Most of each biomass-conversion usually correspond to one specific purpose, such as to produce chemicals, fuels, or energy. However, when a production of chemicals is through one or more oxidation reactions, co-production of electricity is possible through a conversion on an enzymatic bioanode in a biofuel cell. The simultaneous production will reduce the energy required for producing chemicals. According to the coproduction concept, here we show a production of meso-galactaric acid which is considered a platform chemical. meso-Galactaric acid can be obtained from C1 aldehyde oxidation of d-galacturonic acid, which exists in large quantities as pectin in food process residue. d-Galacturonic acid oxidation catalyzed by pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) and subsequent meso-galactaric acid production was confirmed for the first time by NMR measurements. PQQ-GDH is a useful catalyst for in vitro production, especially for electrosynthesis, because it requires neither the expensive cofactor nor O2. Hence, PQQ-GDH was fixed on an electrode to fabricate the PQQ-GDH electrode. The catalytic current from d-galacturonic acid oxidation with the electrode was confirmed in the electrochemical experiments to show the simultaneous production of meso-galactaric acid and the electric current.",

The CE from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus has recently been applied for epilactose and lactulose production in milk at lower temperatures. The kinetic parameters under supposedly industrial relevant conditions and the direct comparability of CsCE and DtCE still remain unknown and were, therefore, the object of this study. In general, CsCE and DtCE displayed similar reaction progresses and similar kinetic parameters. Surprisingly, the CsCE was observed to catalyse the isomerisation reaction of lactulose into lactose and epilactose twice as efficiently (kcat/Km) as DtCE. For the first time, the reaction progress for lactose, epilactose and lactulose as substrates was observed for both CsCE and DtCE over 48\u00a0h at 50\u00a0\u00b0C, pH 7.5. These conversions led to the same final sugar concentrations of about 30.5%ts lactose, 14.5%ts epilactose and 55%ts lactulose with both CEs.

Due to economic and environmental concerns, LDCs active at elevated pH are highly desirable. In this study, a new LDC from Aliivibrio salmonicida (AsLdc) was discovered, expressed, and characterized. Compared to the LDCs from Escherichia coli, LdcC and CadA, the latter was frequently used for cadaverine production, the purified AsLdc showed much higher activities at alkaline pH 7.0\u20138.5, for instance, 205.1\u00a0U/mg at pH 7.5 with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL enzyme, in comparison to 68.3 and 51.5\u00a0U/mg for CadA and LdcC, respectively. The activities of AsLdc and CadA correlated well with the proportions of decamers at the pH range of 5.0\u20138.5. AsLdc with a melting temperature of 79\u00a0\u00b0C was more thermostable than CadA (73.6\u00a0\u00b0C). When used for whole-cell biotransformation of l-lysine to cadaverine at pH 7.5, AsLdc completed the transformation within 7\u00a0h while the CadA did only 82.8%. These results indicate the high potential of the new AsLdc for the industrial production of cadaverine.",

We compared the catalysis efficiency of papain and bromelain in catalyzing l-phenylalanine methyl ester (l-Phe-Me) for oligomer peptides synthesis. A set of reaction conditions (such as protease type, reaction temperature, time, and pH) have been tested for the polymerization reaction with papain and bromelain, respectively. Moreover, the resultant oligomers were analyzed through 1HNMR and MALDI-TOF. The results indicated that the average degree of polymerization (DP) reached the highest value (6.74) when papain was used for l-Phe-Me polymerization in phosphate buffer (0.2\u00a0M, pH 8) at 40\u00a0\u00b0C for three hours. At 50\u00a0\u00b0C, the DP reached 6.62 with a yield of 72.9% when papain as the catalyst. Its yield and DP were 4.50 and 1.27 folds higher than those of the oligo- peptides synthesized by bromelain. Moreover, we found the DP and the yield of oligo(l-Phe) can be enhanced with higher reaction temperature and longer reaction time. In summary, papain presents better catalytic properties compared with bromelain for l-Phe polymerization in terms of DP and yield. Oligomerization catalyzed by papain at high temperature presents a potent procedure for the synthesis of biologically active oligo(l-Phe) peptides.",

The fundamental understanding of the difference in specificity of lipases in esterification/transesterification reactions in presence of solvents can help in reduction of experimental cost.

The protein conformations from MD were used for docking studies to estimate \u0394\u0394G between R and S form of tetrahedral intermediate. The predicted E value was compared with experimental data for hexane and good agreement was obtained. It was observed that hexane and toluene are better solvents for chiral resolution of 1-phenylethanol compared to tert-butyl methyl ether and decalin when lipase in free form is used.

     "abstract": "Chemo-enzymatic reactions combine the advantages of chemistry and biocatalysis. Chemical synthesis provides precursor molecules and low costs, whereas the application of enzymes provides selectivity. Additionally, the mild reaction conditions of enzymatic approaches allow the chemical application of intermediates and/or products that otherwise are not accessible. One example is the in situ production of peroxycarboxylic acids (peracids) by Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB). In contrast to the harsh conditions of chemical peracid synthesis, CalB catalyzed reactions run at low temperatures and without additives. Unfortunately, the enzyme is rapidly inactivated by the oxidative environment. Herein, we report on CalB stabilization by preventing disulfide cleavage after H2O2 exposure. Therefore, a bismaleimide functionalized linker was used to convert all the enzyme\u2019s disulfide bridges to more stable thioether linkages. These bonds are still affected by hydrogen peroxide but will not open upon oxidation. A two- to fourfold excess of this linker was optimal to avoid enzyme oligomerization. At the same time, a 1.5 fold increase in half life time after exposure to hydrogen peroxide was achieved. To our knowledge, such an approach to intramolecular disulfide stabilization has never been reported before, but might be a general strategy for enzyme engineering. Furthermore, a carrier screening was performed, identifying different optimal carrier types for CalB immobilization.

In this study, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was regenerated with high efficiency via UV photocatalysis using original TiO2 nanoparticles as the catalyst, disodium salt of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the electron donor and [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ as the mediator. When the loading amount of TiO2 was increased, the initial reaction rate first increased and subsequently remained almost unchanged. In the presence of 1.5\u00a0mg/mL TiO2, the NADH yield reached approximately 90% after 30\u00a0min of irradiation. Several electron donors were investigated. Disodium and tetrasodium salt of EDTA were demonstrated to be superior to triethanolamine, CH3OH, trisodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate and H2O under appropriate pH conditions. The optimal concentration for disodium EDTA and rhodium mediator was 0.15 and 0.25\u00a0M, respectively, and the preferred molar ratio of NAD+ to TiO2 and [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ was 1:0.1:0.25. Regenerative NADH was successfully applied in the enzymatic reduction of formaldehyde to methanol with a high conversion percentage (up to 95% after several minutes), which was notably close to fresh NADH. This work provides an alternative strategy to catalyst modification for the high-efficiency photoregeneration of coenzyme by optimizing the regeneration system.",

In order to overcome these disadvantages, we investigated microbial glucosylation of 6-gingerol by the soil bacterium Ensifer sp.

The SMG1-F278D exhibited 4-fold increased esterification activity as well as superior fatty acid (FA) specificity for medium chain FAs. Molecular docking study suggested that the caprylic acid (CA) was strongly bound to the catalytic residue Ser171 present in the SMG1-F278D as compared to SMG1. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were employed in order to understand the structural conformations of SMG1 and SMG1-F278D. The structure of SMG1-F278D was found to be more compact as well as less deviated from its native conformation. There was an increase in \u03b2-sheet as well as \u03b1-helix in the SMG1-F278D that may stabilize the protein structure due to point mutation. Finally, the capability of SMG1-F278D in synthesis of DAG was evaluated. Effects of reaction parameters such as substrate molar ratio of glycerol to FAs, enzyme loading and reaction temperature on the esterification were investigated. The optimal reaction conditions were achieved as 4:1 molar ratio of glycerol to FAs, enzyme loading of 100\u00a0U/g (U/w, with respect to the total substrates) and temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C.

In this study, two novel esterases were identified in hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus VF5 based on the typical characteristics of lipolytic enzymes. Two genes, Aaeo1 and Aaeo2 encoded 207 and 226 amino acids respectively, were synthesized after optimization according to the P. pastoris codon preferences. Using sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, Aaeo1 and Aaeo2, were classified into the bacterial lipolytic enzyme family VIII and V, respectively. Two genes were cloned and expressed in P. pastoris cells, and the recombinant enzymes were purified from culture supernatants by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography and characterized.

After 2 months of storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the immobilised proteases showed good stability, retaining more than 85% of their initial activity. The high magnetic response of MNPs render an ease of separation and reusability, which contributes to the residual activity of both immobilised proteases on MNPs retaining more than 60% of their initial values after seven hydrolytic cycles. These results showed the enhancement of the stability of the crosslinking interactions between the proteases and nanoparticles.

After structural simulation, refinement, and molecular docking, all ligands were able to recognize the coenzyme site of SOX. In addition, when the position 7- or 8-site of the compounds was modified, new pi-cation/sigma interactions were formed in the SOX-ligand complex. Fluorescent detection revealed that all the ligands could be successfully reconstructed with unfolded SOX. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra and nano differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicated that the loss of phosphoric acid and adeninein natural coenzymes could significantly reduce the \u03b1-helix content, transition temperature (Tm), and calorimetric enthalpy (\u0394H). In addition, although reconstruction with the position 7- or 8-site modified compounds led to variations in secondary structure, no significant shifts in Tm and \u0394H were observed. Furthermore, in the evaluation of catalytic kinetic parameters, when SOX was reconstructed with ligands containing halogen atoms at the 7- or 8-sites, much higher relative specificities in the presence of organic solvents were noted.",

The materials obtained (expanded perlite treated with HCl, rehydroxylated expanded perlite, zeolite, and the incorporation of polystyrene in expanded perlite) were analysed by infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis, zeta potential, adsorption of N2, and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The analysis allowed us to confirm that the modifications on the materials studied were effective. This is perceived by an increase in bands corresponding to OH groups, which is beneficial when considering functional groups that interact directly with the enzyme. It also allowed us to determine that the materials tested exhibit good thermal stability at the temperature range in which enzymatic studies are conducted. The conditions for immobilisation (pH, concentration of glutaraldehyde, time of contact between the enzyme and the substrate, enzyme concentration) and some properties of the immobilised derivatives (optimum pH, temperature of maximum activity, and reuse) were analysed. The suitable range for the immobilisation of \u03b1-amylase from A. oryzae by covalent binding was pH between 5 and 6, and for immobilisation by adsorption the suitable pH range was between 5 and 5.5. These values are consistent with the zeta potential values previously determined for the different media studied. The reuse of the immobilised enzyme by covalent binding resulted in a residual activity of 90% up to the sixth reuse. Immobilisation by covalent binding was more effective than immobilisation by adsorption.",

     "abstract": "l-Ornithine, a non-protein amino acid, is widely used as a food supplement and nutrition product that is usually produced by the enzymatic hydrolysis of l-arginine. However, urea, a by-product, complicates purification of l-ornithine. Here, we describe a highly efficient coupled system, which involves Rummeliibacillus pycnus arginase and Jack bean urease, for the production of l-ornithine without urea residue. Although R. pycnus arginase exhibited the highest enzyme activity at pH 9.5 with Mn2+, it could be activated by Ni2+ at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 6.5. Kinetic study showed that, compared with Mn2+-containing arginase, Ni2+-containing arginase had a higher substrate affinity and catalysis efficiency. Based on the properties of commercial Jack bean urease and recombinant arginase, both enzymes showed robust activity at pH 6.5 and 40\u201350\u00a0\u00b0C. Using a coupled system involving arginase and urease for bioconversion, l-ornithine production of 37.8\u00a0g\u00a0l\u22121 was achieved with a 99.7% molar yield within 5\u00a0h. Thus, this coupled system represents an applicable strategy for the biosynthesis of l-ornithine.",

However, CAL-B substrate\u2019s scope for enzymatic kinetic resolution (EKR) of carboxylic acids and their derivatives is limited, especially by low stereoselectivity. In an attempt to overcome this drawback, we decided to employ substrate engineering of enzymatic transesterification of 2-bromobutyric esters by changing the alcohol moiety of the structure. The modifications in the substrate resulted mainly in alterations of the conversion rate, but the inclusion of a chiral alcohol moiety such as (R)-1-phenylethanol resulted in inversion of CAL-B enantiopreference. When esters containing ordinary achiral aliphatic alcohol moiety were used, CAL-B presented S-selectivity. This selectivity was unexpectedly changed to R when an ester containing (R)-1-phenylethyl alcohol moiety was introduced. The use of (R)-1-phenylethanol and its derivatives as nucleophiles in the EKR of the 2-bromobutyric esters also resulted in the inversion of enzymatic enantiopreference. This is the first time that CAL-B acyl enantiopreference has been switched by the chiral nature of the alcohol moiety.",

The wide use of PEs has become a public health concern as they are considered toxic to human health and PE contamination of the environment is increasing. In this study, we cloned a gene encoding the psychrophilic phthalate esterase (hereafter referred to as EstSP1) from an Arctic bacterium, Sphingomonas glacialis PAMC 26605, and characterized the properties of recombinant EstSP1 protein. EstSP1 belongs to the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase family and its catalytic triad consists of Ser 161, Asp 253, and His 283 residues. Thermal stability and protein folding of EstSP1 were reduced under ambient temperatures when compared with those at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, despite EstSP1 maintaining its secondary structure at 4\u00a0\u00b0C\u201350\u00a0\u00b0C. EstSP1 is unique among cold-adapted esterases in that it not only has substrate preferences for phthalates with shorter ester chains (C2\u2013C6), but also tolerance to polar organic solvents, including alcohols and DMSO. Furthermore, EstSP1 exhibited a larger change in conformational flexibility in ethanol, isopropanol, and DMSO when evaluated by acrylamide-induced fluorescence quenching. The results indicate that EstSP1 is a novel organic solvent-tolerant, psychrophilic phthalate esterase.",

We successfully improved thermostability and catalytic efficiency of NAGK from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgNAGK) by site-saturated mutagenesis. Residues G71, I74 and F91 that located in the substrate-binding pocket were selected to be substituted according to sequences alignment and homologous modeling.

Results indicated that the length and shape of residue, hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bond interactions and conjugation effect had significant impact on catalytic efficiency and stability by analyzing the structure of mutants and CgNAGK. Substitution of Val for I74 and replacement of F91 with His or Tyr both resulted in small structure changes of substrate binding pocket, which contributed to improve protein stability and catalytic efficiency. Our strategy could provide a way of improving enzyme activity and stability. Simultaneously, it could provide an insight into the catalytic mechanism of CgNAGK and amino acid kinase family.",

The results of MD-simulation demonstrate that the overall structure maintained stable with or without polar organic solvent; however, the lid region was found more flexible in the presence of polar organic solvent.

Along the last 30 years, a variety of mono- and di-substituted arenes have been studied as substrates for this enzyme, and some interesting observations have been reported regarding the yield and selectivity of the biotransformation. Nevertheless, none of them has been explained considering the active site\u2019 structural and electronic features. In this work we present the first computational model of TDO\u2019s active site, with a description of its architecture and interactions with the substrate to understand and predict substrate orientation. Our findings indicate that in the O2-free TDO, the iron(II) is stabilized by the coordination of an oxygen atom from the neighboring Gln215 residue. Besides, the active site is comprised by four pockets with different relative affinities for the substrates\u2019 substituents. Monosubstituted arenes adopt a pose in which the alkyl chains maximize the London dispersion interactions with minimal steric clashes, giving an explanation for the observed trend in the benzylic hydroxylation yields. Finally, the computational results allowed us to rationalize the enantiomeric excess of 1,4-disubstituted arenes and the regioselectivity of the dihydroxylation of fluorobenzene. These data were used to develop and validate an affinity index (AI), as a quantitative indicator of the orientation preference for these substrates. This practical and easy-to-use tool can be applied to successfully predict the orientation of the para-disubstituted benzenes into the TDO active site.",

This allowed the determination of the rate constants of hydrolysis of each individual cleavage site in the substrate protein. For five cleavage sites, no cleavages were found.

     "abstract": "The enzyme activity of \u03b1-chymotrypsin (ChT) has been known to increase with the addition of polyelectrolytes and amine compounds that combine with oppositely charged substrates. Enzyme hyperactivation is thought to occur by changing the electrostatic field around the enzyme, leading to favorable interactions between the enzyme and substrate. Inspired by the enzyme hyperactivation system, this paper focuses on inorganic salts as additives that specifically affect the enzyme activity of ChT toward the small, hydrophobic substrate phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide. The enzyme activity of ChT increased linearly with increasing concentration of kosmotropes; kcat/KM of ChT in the presence of 1.5\u00a0M sodium sulfate was 18-fold higher than in the absence of salts. In contrast, the enzyme activity of ChT was decreased by sodium perchlorate and sodium thiocyanate due to denaturation. Enzyme kinetic analysis showed that the increased activity of ChT caused by sodium sulfate results from both increasing kcat and decreasing KM. Kosmotropes enhanced both the structural stability of the native state and hydrophobic interactions between the enzyme and substrate. This simple yet effective enzyme activation mechanism provides biotechnological applications as well as new insight into the enzymology of ChT.",

     "abstract": "This study kinetically characterized the mechanism of the enzymatic synthesis of theaflavins (TFs) from catechins by mushroom tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1). In reactions containing one of four catechins, (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and their galloylated forms (ECg and EGCg), they were oxidized by tyrosinase with apparent KM values of 3.78, 5.55, 0.80, and 3.05\u00a0mM, respectively, and with different consumption rates, of which EC was more than four times higher than those of the others. In reactions with binary combinations of catechins with tyrosinase, the synthesis of TF1 from EC and EGC occurred most efficiently, while the yields of mono- and di-galloylated TFs, TF2A, TF2B, and TF3, were low. Time-dependent changes in concentrations of the reactants suggested that the enzymatic oxidation of catechins and the subsequent non-enzymatic coupling redox reaction between the quinone derived from EC or ECg and the intact pyrogallol-type catechin (EGC or EGCg) proceeded concurrently. The latter reaction induced the rapid decrease of EGC and EGCg and it was remarkable for EGCg. So the efficiency of condensation of a pair of quinones from catechol- and pyrogallol-type catechins is restricted, critically influencing the yield of TFs. Using green tea extracts as mixtures of the four substrate catechins, tyrosinase produced TF1 most abundantly. Furthermore, a remarkable enhancement of production of TF2A and TF2B as well as TF1 was observed, when the initial concentration of EGCg was low. These results suggest that the catechin composition has an impact on yields of TFs.",

Although the immobilization of lipases is widely reported, the search for new supports and immobilization protocols with better properties is still important. In this study, mono- and heterofunctionalized silica magnetic microparticles (SMMPs) were synthetized for immobilization of lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB). The SMMPs were prepared in a micro-emulsion system containing sodium silicate and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, followed by chemical modification with octyl groups and octyl plus aldehyde groups. These supports allowed the immobilization of CALB by hydrophobic adsorption or hydrophobic/covalent linkages, achieving immobilization yield of 88% and recovered activities of 128% and 59%, respectively. The performance of the magnetic biocatalysts was evaluated in the synthesis of xylose fatty acid esters (laurate or oleate) in tert-butyl alcohol medium, yielding around 60% conversion after 48\u00a0h under optimized conditions (xylose/fatty acid molar ratio of 1:0.2, 55\u00a0\u00b0C, and activity load of 37.5\u00a0U/g).

     "abstract": "It is usually time-consuming to determine intrinsic kinetic parameters of bisubstrate enzymes, especially when experimental kinetic data deviate from a linear Lineweaver-Burk plot due to complex inhibition patterns. A typical example is \u03c9-transaminase (\u03c9-TA) which is an industrially important enzyme for asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines. \u03c9-TA catalyzes transfer of an amino group between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) via a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism and often displays substrate inhibitions by reactive amino acceptors, which leads one to prefer to determine apparent kinetic parameters rather than intrinsic ones despite limited applicability for precise understanding of enzyme properties. Here, we developed a new method to determine intrinsic kinetic parameters of \u03c9-TA by double-reciprocal analysis using only two sets of kinetic data. First, linear regression of 1/initial rate (vi) against 1/[A] was carried out with one set of kinetic data measured at a fixed [D] while [A] lay far below the concentration range under the influence of substrate inhibition. Second, another linear regression of 1/[D] vs 1/vi was conducted with one set of kinetic data obtained at a fixed [A] within a substantial substrate inhibition range. The resulting four equations obtained from the y-intercepts and slopes of the two regression lines were used for determination of four intrinsic kinetic parameters, i.e. turnover number (kcat), substrate inhibition constant (KSI) for A and Michaelis constants (KM) for D and A. To evaluate reliability of the intrinsic parameters, a validity test was taken by comparing experimental and computational results for the maximum point on a concave-down substrate inhibition curve. Once the intrinsic parameters were determined for a substrate pair, intrinsic parameters for other substrates were simply assessed by constituting a new substrate pair with the kinetically characterized substrate and carrying out linear regression with one set of kinetic data. Our method is expected to be applicable to a wide range of bisubstrate enzymes for facile determination of intrinsic kinetic parameters including KSI.",

Excg1 was tolerant to various organic solvents at a concentration of 5% (w/v) and also to sodium acetate up to 200\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121. Xylobiose and xylotriose with a 4-O-methylglucuronic acid branching were the main products of beechwood xylan hydrolysis, and the time course of hydrolysis was not affected by NaCl 0.5\u00a0mol\u00a0L\u22121 or sea water. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a halotolerant endoxylanase from fungal origin.

This intracellular nitrilase induced by acetonitrile (0.3%) catalyses the conversion of 3-cyanopyridine to nicotinic acid without noticeable production of nicotinamide. Optimal pH and temperature of Nitrilase AC21 was obtained at pH 8.0 and 45\u00a0\u00b0C. Irreversible thermo-inactivation results showed that, enzyme half-life was 6\u00a0h at 80\u00a0\u00b0C. Several process factors, including quantity of enzyme and rate of substrate feeding, were considered with the goal of reaching whole substrate transformation. In a fed batch manner at 1\u00a0l scale using hyper-induced AC21 resting cells equivalent to 10\u00a0U\u00a0ml\u22121 nitrilase activity, a total of 945\u00a0mM of 3-cyanopyridine was formed at a rate of 3.32\u00a0g h\u22121\u00a0g\u00a0dcw\u22121, which directed AC21 has ability of application in large scale nicotinic acid production.",

In this study, we cloned the AofaeD coding sequence into Pichia pastoris and demonstrated heterologous expression and secretion of active recombinant enzyme (rAoFaeD) as a 30-kDa protein in the culture medium. Purified rAoFaeD exhibited optimal activity at pH 7.0 and at 45\u00a0\u00b0C, but was stable at a pH range of 7.0\u201310.0 and a temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C. While wild-type rAoFaeD failed to cleave the methyl esters of ferulic acid (MFA), p-coumaric acid (MpCA), caffeic acid (MCA), and sinapic acid (MSA) and ethyl ester of ferulic acid (EFA), enzyme exhibited esterase activity when wheat arabinoxylan was used as a substrate, and this reaction was enhanced synergistically by the addition of xylanase. Notably, rAoFaeD variants in which one of the tryptophan residues (Trp142 or Trp144) located adjacent to the putative catalytic serine residue at position 143 (Ser143) was replaced with phenylalanine and tyrosine (W142F and W144Y), respectively, exhibited hydrolytic activity toward MFA, MpCA, MCA, MSA, and EFA. Moreover, these variants exhibited enhanced production of ferulic acid from wheat arabinoxylan compared to the wild-type protein, and the activity of these proteins was enhanced by the addition of xylanase.",

     "abstract": "One of the major challenges in biocatalysis is the discovery or development of novel biocatalysts suitable for different applications. Within the last decades, directed evolution has emerged as a powerful tool for generating diversity and has allowed the development of biocatalysts with the desired properties. An alternative way to increase diversity among biocatalysts is to further explore nature on the search for novel activities or broader substrate specificity. Recent estimations indicate that we have been able to culture in the lab only 1% of the existing microorganisms, thus the strategy of searching for enzyme activities among existing microorganisms could still provide a manifold of useful biocatalysts. The endophytic community is a particularly interesting group of microorganisms since they have adapted themselves to live in an environment rich in biologically active compounds. Furthermore, several endophytes are able to produce secondary metabolites mimicking their host plant. It has been proposed that the endophytes have acquired these capabilities through years of co-evolution with their host plant. These characteristics indicate that endophytic microorganisms can be a rich source of novel enzymes; despite that, they have been scarcely explored in biocatalysis. This review attempts to cover all the precedents in the area of biotransformation and biocatalysis mediated by endophytic microorganisms.",

Reactivity of 1-(N-acylamino)alkylphosphonic and 1-(N-acylamino)alkylphosphinic acids and their esters in the penicillin G acylase-mediated hydrolytic deacylation reaction depends strongly on the kind of their N-acyl group, with high preference to the hydrolytic splitting of the N-phenylacetyl moiety. The initial hydrolysis rates of 1-(N-phenylacetylamino)alkylphosphonic acid dimethyl esters 2 are mostly distinctly lower in comparison with the corresponding free acids 3 and rapidly decrease with the increasing steric effect of the substituent at the \u03b1-position. In contrary to the substituents at the \u03b1-carbon, bulky substituents at the phosphorus hinder the enzymatic hydrolysis to a much lesser degree. The penicillin G acylase-mediated stereospecific hydrolysis of N-acyl group of both racemic 1-(N-acylamino)alkylphosphonic acids 3 and their dimethyl esters 2 proved to be, in most cases, a highly effective method for the kinetic resolution of these compounds. High enzyme enantioselectivity E-values exceeding 100, or synthetically useful E-values exceeding 20 (in two cases) were obtained for the N-acylated phosphonic acid analogues of alanine, phenylalanine, valine, leucine, and asparagine, as well as for their dimethyl esters, with the exception of the dimethyl ester of phosphonic analogue of valine 2e, that E-value was low (E\u00a0=\u00a01.2).

In contrary, E-values for both diastereomers of ethyl ester of phenylphosphinic analogue of alanine 2k were low (E\u00a0=\u00a07 and 13).

     "abstract": "Ionic liquids (ILs) have many potential benefits in biochemical processes, including improved substrate or product solubility, increased enzyme selectivity, and higher yield. Varying ion substituents allow ILs to be tuned or optimized to achieve a specific goal. Unfortunately, optimization based on a single design criterion can have undesirable side effects on other process components. For example, hydrophilic ILs capable of efficiently dissolving biomass often inhibit enzymatic activity during hydrolysis. A panel of nine different aqueous ILs was selected for this study to systematically assess which factors contribute to the loss of enzyme activity. The activity of endoglucanase E1 from Acidothermus cellulolyticus steadily decreased in higher concentrations of ILs, especially in the presence of the common cellulose dissolving solvent 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. The impact of most other ILs could be rationalized via the Hofmeister series. Enzyme behavior was further probed by rationally modifying the surface charge of E1. Variants were computationally designed to have positively or negatively charged surfaces and assessed for activity in ILs. Surprisingly, positive supercharging maintained wild type activity levels in ILs, while negative supercharging drastically reduced activity. Discrepancy between stability and activity measurements for some ILs indicated active site inhibition or other unique inactivation mechanisms might be crucial components to consider in future studies.",

Naringenin was hydroxylated at the 3\u2032-position in a regiospecific manner to yield eriodictyol.

We used the quantum mechanical cluster method to model the enzyme active site. Glyoxalase I accepts both enantiomers of the hemithioacetal between methylglyoxal and glutathione and converts them to the S-D enantiomer of lactoylglutathione. We have compared several previously suggested or alternative reaction mechanisms for both substrates on an equal footing. The results show that the coordination shell of the Zn ion in the optimized geometries is more symmetric than in some inhibitor crystal structures, which we assign to differences in the electronic structure and the protonation states of the substrate. The symmetry of the active site model indicates that the enzyme can use the same reaction mechanism for the S and the R enantiomers of the substrate, but with exchanged roles of the two active-site glutamate residues. However, the calculations show some asymmetry (0\u20134\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 differences in reaction energies and activation barriers), caused by the different coordination states of the glutamate residues in the starting crystal structure.

In this study, only two hemicelulases, the endo-1,4-xylanases (GH11) from Penicillium funiculosum (XynC11/CAC15487) and the feruloyl esterase (CE1) from Clostridium thermocellum (CtFAE/ATCC27405), effectively broke-down hemicellulose from pretreated sugarcane bagasse (up to 65%), along with the production of xylooligosaccharides (XOS).

     "abstract": "Nitrile reductase is a newly discovered enzyme class that can catalyze the reduction of nitriles directly to amines, a very important reaction in synthetic organic chemistry. However, little progress has been made towards the application of this biocatalysis reaction for organic synthesis since the initial discovery of nitrile reductase for over ten years. One of the potential reasons may be due to the lack of structural information and biochemical properties, in addition to its inherent narrow substrate scope. Meanwhile, the highly conserved active site residues make it a great challenge to widen the substrate spectrum of nitrile reductase by means of protein engineering approaches. To explore more nitrile reductases with different characteristics (e.g. specific activity, thermostability, etc) for potential synthetic applications, a new nitrile reductase, designated as PcNRed, was discovered from the genome of Pectobacterium carotovorum, with a moderate specific activity of 366\u00a0U/g protein towards its natural substrate, preQ0. The PcNRed was subsequently overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), purified to homogeneity and then its biochemical properties were examined. The optimal reaction temperature and pH were determined to be 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 7.4, respectively. The thermal deactivation process of PcNRed obeys first-order kinetics, with half-lives of 47.2, 13.6 and 3.9\u00a0h measured at 30, 40, and 50\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.

The conformational flexibility required for maximal enzymatic activity differed between PML and LipS, suggesting distinct conformations of PML and LipS in each organic solvent for maximal enzymatic activity.

Genome sequencing revealed the presence of ten putative genes coding for ene-reductases that can be potentially exploited for biocatalytic purposes. To this end, the availability of a method able to predict which isoform binds and turns over a specific substrate would help to choose the best catalyst for the desired bioconversion.Here, homology models of the ten putative enzymes are first generated, validated and show that the proteins share the typical TIM barrel fold with a conserved \u03b2-hairpin cap on one side of the barrel and a non-conserved subdomain capping the other side, where the FMN cofactor is accommodated. The active site of the ten enzymes is different in terms of both volume and charge distribution whereas the residues responsible for substrate recognition and catalysis are generally conserved.Docking of cyclohexenone into the active site of the ten enzymes shows a binding almost superimposable to that found in pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase in complex with this substrate (PDB ID 1GVQ) in isoforms 1, 2, 6 and 10.The data demonstrate that in silico predictions can be used for new putative fungal ene-reductases to predict the best substrate-enzyme matching for the selection of the most suitable catalyst for the desired biotransformation.",

However, it shows low tolerance toward organic solvents. Also the YqiG shows high activities towards maleimide, dimethyl maleate and acyclic ketones (55.5\u00a0U/mg, 6.22\u00a0U/mg and 2.97\u00a0U/mg, respectively).

Nonetheless, the low content in nature and the difficulties in the total synthesis of EsB strongly limit its extensive investigations and further development as a drug candidate. This study aims to provide a practical method for highly efficient preparation of EsB using esculentoside A (EsA, phytolaccagenin 3-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl (1\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-\u03b2-d-xylopyranoside) as the starting material. \u03b2-d-glucosidase from snailase was used to catalyze the formation of EsB, and the product was then purified and fully characterized by both HRMS and NMR. To prepare EsB in a more cost-effective way, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to explore the potential effects of the reaction conditions (such as reaction temperature, pH, enzyme load, and reaction time) on the conversion rates of EsA. The highest EsB yield of 0.66\u00a0mg/ml was obtained experimentally under optimized conditions as follows: temperature 48.28\u00a0\u00b0C, pH 6.4, enzyme load 4.43%, and reaction time 2.73\u00a0h. This result agreed well with the predicted yield of 0.68\u00a0mg/ml by RSM. The enzymatic kinetics of this biotransformation was characterized at the optimum pH and temperature. The S50 value was evaluated as 167.4\u00a0\u03bcM, while the Vmax value was 345.6 nmol/min/mg. In summary, this study provided a mild and practical method for the highly efficient preparation of EsB from EsA, which held great promise for large scale production of EsB.",

Both, activity and enantioselectivity of all the immobilized lipase preparations were evaluated with different racemic esters under different reaction conditions (temperature, pH and solvent polarity). A strong effect of reaction media and immobilization protocol on enzyme activity and selectivity was found. Enzyme immobilization and reaction engineering allowed us obtaining the best immobilization protocol and reaction conditions to achieve high activity and enantioselectivty of CRL as heterogeneous catalyst. CRL immobilized on an agarose-based carrier activated with primary amino groups preferentially hydrolyzed (S)-phenylethyl acetate with E\u00a0>\u00a0200 under pH 7, 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 30% of acetonitrile.

An interesting route is transglycosylation by glycosidases due to their availability and cheap substrates. In this work transglycosylation by means of \u00df-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae was investigated at pH 4.5 using ONPG as glycosyl donor and several saccharides in different concentrations as acceptor. As the influence of ionic liquids was often described to be beneficial for synthesis or specificity of glycosidases, the ionic liquid [Bmim][Pf6] was investigated in an emulsion with aqueous buffer. Additionally, a fed-batch mode is presented here, including the ionic liquid as extraction phase. Reaction products were analyzed via HPLC and thin-layer chromatography.By use of transglycosylation, oligosaccharides were produced in high yields, often above 90%, both in aqueous buffer and the system using buffer and ionic liquid. The application of [Bmim][Pf6] lead to an altered substrate specificity of \u00df-galactosidase: Depending on the system applied, preferentially di- or trisaccharides were produced, partly in contrast to the synthesis in aqueous buffer. Using a new model for the transglycosylation with ONPG reaction the observed reaction courses were well described.The fed-batch mode, applying ONPG above solubility and using [Bmim][Pf6] as extraction phase for ONP, strongly increased and product concentration. In this context it was observed that the absorption spectrum of ONP in [Bmim][Pf6] is altered in the presence of an aqueous phase, even though [Bmim][Pf6] is not mixable with water.The findings in this work enable a better understanding of the influence of ionic liquids on enzyme activity and can help to make glycosidases an even more interesting tool in saccharide synthesis.",

The deglycosylation activity significantly increased when the single DES components \u2013 glycerol and ethylene-glycol \u2013 were added (e.g. 140% of enzyme activity at glycerol at 40% v/v), whereas deleterious effects were observed when choline chloride was solely added, presumably due to its chaotropic effect.

For deracemizing (R,S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (PED) to (R)-PED, a facile one-pot system was established by combination of two stereoselective oxidoreductases, the stereospecific carbonyl reductase 1 (SCR1) and the ketoreductase (KRD).

Lipophilic tyrosyl esters, which are scarce in nature, have proven in certain cases to acquire improved biological activity compared to tyrosol itself, increasing their potential use in the food and cosmeceutical industries. The enzymatic approach for the synthesis of such esters has prevailed, as it is \u201cgreen\u201d, compared to chemical practices. We hereby report the enzymatic synthesis of tyrosyl esters of various aliphatic fatty acids performed by a recombinant cutinase from Fusarium oxysporum (FoCut5a). The reaction system used consists of an aqueous phase saturated with the corresponding fatty-acid vinyl ester, which played the role of the acyl donor. We also proceeded to the study of several parameters on the yield of the tyrosyl butyrate ester synthesis. The maximum yield achieved was 60.7% after 4\u00a0h at 20\u00a0\u00b0C, in pH 7.0, with initial tyrosol concentration of 12.5\u00a0mM and using 5\u00a0\u03bcg FoCut5a mL\u22121 reaction as catalyst. The optimum reaction conditions can be considered mild, highlighting the environmentally friendly nature of this reaction, along with the fact that there are not any harmful reagents involved.

Despite a wealth of reports related to 3-HP biosynthesis in microorganisms, its industrial application still requires further research because of low titer and productivity. Herein an effective enzymatic method for the synthesis of 3-HP was achieved by using free or immobilized recombinant Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring a nitrilase gene from environmental sample (NIT190). Under the optimal conditions (100\u00a0mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 30\u00a0\u00b0C), the maximum substrate concentration which could be completely hydrolyzed by using free cells within 24\u00a0h was 4.5\u00a0mol/L (319.5\u00a0g/L). Furthermore, immobilization of the whole cells enhanced their substrate tolerance (up to 7.0\u00a0mol/L), stability, and reusability. The immobilized cells could be reused for up to 30 batches, and 70% of enzyme activity was retained after 74 batches in distilled water. The titer (184.7\u00a0g/L) and productivity (36.9\u00a0g/(L\u00a0h)) were obtained by isolation and purification of 3-HP from the first 30 batches. These results demonstrate that the immobilized cells have potential industrial application for the synthesis of 3-HP.",

Most studies in the past used toxic p-nitrophenyl sulfate as a sulfate donor for sulfation by this enzyme. However both the donor and p-nitrophenol are difficult to remove from the sulfated products. This new donor N-hydroxysuccinimide sulfate is easy to synthesize and has the advantage that at pH values above 7 it hydrolyzes to N-hydroxysuccinimide which is a safe compound and can easily be removed. As examples we demonstrated the formation of sulfated resveratrol and synthesized efficiently 3-sulfo-17-\u03b2-estradiol and bisphenol A bisulfate.

On SDS-PAGE, the purified enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 46.2\u00a0kDa. The N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences were determined and the cloned xylanase gene were sequenced.

MAO-Ns are important enzymes in the chemical industry due to their stereoselectivity and they are often used for the deracemisation of non-optically pure mixtures of amines. Biomass production, enzyme preparation, enzyme immobilisation, process parameters for the immobilised enzyme and characterisation of the enzyme are described in detail here. The biomass was prepared in laboratory bioreactors, and two different disruption techniques were compared. The activity of the enzyme was determined by biotransformation with secondary amine 3-azabicyclo [3,3,0] octane as a substrate. The crude enzyme extract showed 61.5% of the whole cell activity and the immobilised enzyme showed a wider optimum pH and temperature ranges than the free enzyme. The initial specific activity of the immobilised monoamine oxidase crude enzyme extract remained at 80% after 12 repeated biotransformations.

Surface functional groups of chitosan coated MNPs, lipase enzyme, and immobilized lipase enzyme were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FT-IR) analysis. The structural characteristics of the chitosan coated magnetic nanoparticles were analyzed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) studies. The statistical methodology with central composite design (CCD) was applied to evaluate the effects of immobilization, including the magnetic nanoparticles, lipase enzyme, pH and immobilization time on the enzyme activity. Based on the statistical analysis, the optimum immobilization conditions of magnetic nanoparticles (40\u00a0mg), lipase enzyme (40\u00a0mg), pH (9), and immobilization time (6\u00a0h), the maximum enzyme activity obtained was 16.94\u00a0U/mL.

Then, the purified recombinant exo-inulinase (rEXINU) and endo-inulinase (rENINU), either individual or combination with another, were used for hydrolysis of inulin and inulin in tuber meal of Jerusalem artichoke. After the analysis of the dynamic hydrolysis process, it was found that the rEXINU and the rENINU acted synergistically with each other, and the maximum degree of synergistic effect on the level of fructose formation (DSEFru) could be obtained with a molar ratio of the rEXINU to the rENINU at 1:1. Furthermore, the investigation of the hydrolysis product in the synergistic hydrolysis process showed that a wide range of oligosaccharides were first generated and then converted to fructose. Based on the enzyme kinetics, substrate specificity and product inhibition of the rEXINU and the rENINU, a synergism mechanism of the them for the inulin hydrolysis was proposed. During the process of the synergistic action, the rENINU preferentially degraded the inulin with high DP, but was inhibited by the produced oligosaccharides. Then the released oligosaccharides which were the optimum substrates of the rEXIUN were rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme to produce fructose and glucose. Meanwhile, this process relieved the inhibition of the produced oligosaccharides to the rENINU. Besides, in the synergistic hydrolysis of the inulin in tuber meal of Jerusalem artichoke, the depolymerization of the rENINU could result in the increase of the subtrate solubility to improve the hydrolysis efficiency. Therefore, this kind of the synergistic effect between the exo-inulinase and the endo-inulinase may provide a potential driving force in the industrial application of inulin and inulin-containing materials.",

It has been shown for the first time that nucleotidase activity of PAP exhibits positive cooperativity, or homotropic allostery, in binding the purine ribonucleotides. Therefore, these substrates are homotropic positive effectors, or homotropic allosteric activators, of PAP-catalysed reaction. Enzyme-substrate saturation curves described by Hill equation are sigmoidal and the values of Hill cooperativity coefficient h are higher than 1. The affinity of PAP to substrates, the degree of cooperativity and the efficiency all depend on the chemical nature of the ribonucleotide and they increase in the following order: 5\u2032-AMP\u00a0<\u00a05\u2032-IMP\u00a0<\u00a05\u2032-GMP\u00a0<\u00a03\u2032-AMP, but the enzyme reactivity remains almost equal.

The method led to very effective MnP immobilization (91.0%), and imparted remarkable stability to the enzyme (82.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9% after 2 months of storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C). The optimum pH was 5.0 and 4.0 for soluble and sol-gel immobilized MnP, respectively. Sol-gel encapsulated MnP exhibited 43% residual activity at 50\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas the free enzyme lost its activity completely after 72\u00a0h. After 5\u00a0h reaction time, textile wastewater effluents were decolorized to different extents (with a maximum of 93.92%) by immobilized MnP. Operational stability of the entrapped MnP was significantly improved after immobilization, and it retained more than 70% of original activity after three repeated uses for the tested effluents. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) of maximally decolorized effluents were below the permissible limits. The cytotoxicity evaluated through Allium cepa and brine shrimp lethality tests was considerably reduced after treatment with immobilized MnP. The broader pH stability, better thermo-and storage stability, and high catalytic activity are the attractive features of immobilized MnP that make it a promising candidate for environmental biotechnology.",

Since these functionalities are highly dependent on the degree of hydrolysis (DH) of the hydrolysates, the enzymatic hydrolysis process must be carefully controlled. Hydrolysates with both free amino acids and long-chain peptides are usually not desirable which leads to strict requirements for the commercial peptidases used. In the study presented, we characterized ten commercially available peptidase preparations in respect of the production of protein hydrolysates with defined compositions. Therefore, we utilized a three-step methodology to investigate the composition of the commercial peptidase preparations and to characterize the obtained protein hydrolysates applying a HPLC-based system for automated small-scale enzymatic reaction and analysis. With the presented methodology we identified two suitable preparations for the production of hydrolysates with high DH and high amounts of free amino acids, and six suitable preparations for the production of hydrolysates with low DH and negligible release of amino acids.",

     "abstract": "It is well recognized that oils with a high 1,3-diacylglycerol content has the advantage of suppressing the accumulation of visceral fat and preventing the increase of body weight, and the synthesis of 1,3-diacylglycerol has attracted considerable attention. It is important to explore various methods for 1,3-diacylglycerol synthesis. In this work, the potential of using lipase Lipozyme TL IM-mediated esterification of oleic acid with glycerol for 1,3-diolein preparation was explored. The effect of solvent, oleic acid feeding strategy, online water removal, water activity, temperature, molar ratio of oleic acid to glycerol and enzyme dosage on the diolein yield and 1,3-positional selectivity of the lipase was investigated systematically. It was found that solvent, water activity, temperature, substrate molar ratio and enzyme dosage had varied influence on diolein yield as well as the positional selectivity of the enzyme. With the increasing water activity and solvent\u2019s log\u00a0P, diolein yield and the positional selectivity increased to a maximum value at a certain point, then had a decrease. It seems that in the process with multiple reaction involved, reactions trend to generate the products with log\u00a0P closer to the system log\u00a0P. In addition, with the water activity being closer to its optimum water activity, the hydration degree of the enzyme would be closer to its optimum hydration degree, and the activity might be closer to the highest enzyme activity, causing the reaction proceeding better. Under the optimum conditions (1.8\u00a0g Lipozyme TL IM was used to catalyze the reaction with 9.8\u00a0g oleic acid and 0.72\u00a0g glycerol in the system with 8.4\u00a0g toluene, and 6.4\u00a0g molecular sieve to remove water), a total diolein yield of about 50% could be achieved with the content of 1,3-diolein in the total diolein over 90%.",

The present study examines the mechanism of enzymatic de-acidification in degummed rapeseed oil by esterification of free fatty acids with an acyl-group acceptor (monoacylglycerol) utilizing an immobilized lipase from Rhizomucor miehei. As the experiments were performed in a solvent free system, first investigations comprise the exclusion of possible mass transfer limitations. The results obtained for the kinetically controlled system strongly indicate that the reaction seems to follow a multi-substrate Ping Pong mechanism. A slight competitive inhibition of the reaction by the acyl-group acceptors was observed during the determination of the effect of substrate concentration on lipase-catalyzed esterification. The free fatty acid content did not influence the activity of the biocatalyst within the ranges investigated. The kinetic parameters were determined, exhibiting that the lipase has a higher affinity towards the acyl-group acceptors (K(AGA)\u00a0=\u00a0150\u00a0mM) than to free fatty acids (K(AGD)\u00a0=\u00a0204\u00a0mM).

Best conversion yields were generally obtained at 40\u00a0\u00b0C in n-heptane, but temperature of 50\u00a0\u00b0C and the solvents hexane and isooctane proved to be also useful. Then, crude lipases from five strains, namely Rhizomucor miehei NRRL 5282, Rhizopus oryzae NRRL 1526, Rhizopus stolonifer SZMC 13609, Mucor corticolus SZMC 12031 and Mortierella echinosphaera CBS 575.75 were selected for further kinetic studies and to evaluate the effect of the acyl acceptors and donors with various chain lengths on the reaction. In general, ethanol up to 4.25\u00a0mol/L concentration enhanced the catalytic activities, and a steady conversion with maximum yields ranging from 61.2% to 90.5% was obtained at about 96\u00a0h. Replacement of ethanol as the acyl acceptor with methanol, isopropanol, n-butanol or n-hexanol resulted in lower conversions when incubated with the same concentration. The selected crude lipases demonstrated high initial affinity toward the medium-chain aryl esters with C8 and C12 acids. Esterification of palmitic acid with ethanol showed much slower catalysis rates resulting in less specific activities than transesterification. The high stability in organic solvents makes the investigated crude enzymes promising candidates for further studies aiming at the application in organic synthesis processes.",

In our knowledge, it is one of the highest temperature optima described till now, even among those reported for thermophilic fungi; recalling here that our fungus is a mesophilic one. The N-terminal sequence was almost identical to that deduced from the previously cloned pga1 gene. The mass spectrometry analysis of PG1 further confirmed its belonging to the pga1 gene. As the peptide sequence of the pga1 bears the signature of endopolygalacturonases, we brought in this work evidences that it belongs to enzymes that hydrolyze pectin by endo-fashion. Indeed, during the hydrolysis of polygalacturonic acid by PG1, the viscosity drops very quickly while reducing sugars were released very slowly. In addition, thin layer chromatography showed that mainly oligosaccharides were released from PGA, namely tetra and tri-galacturonic acids. The purified PG1 was able to enhance the clarification of citrus juice.

From the deduced amino acid sequence it was assigned to glycoside hydrolase family 5. EndoG showed similarity to non-characterized proteins, and its parental organism is likely related to the genus Prevotella. The 1146pb ORF encoding EndoG was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and the protein purified. The recombinant EndoG displayed a wide range of pH activity with a maximum at pH 5.0 and at least 65% activity at pH between 4.5 and 7.5. The enzyme was highly stable at 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h, and retained 81% activity at 4\u00a0M NaCl. EndoG was also active in the presence of diverse divalent cations, detergents, EDTA, acetate, furfural, imidazolium ionic liquids, and ethanol. Glucose or cellobiose had no effect in EndoG performance. EndoG behaved as a multifunctional endo- and exo-glucanase, as well as xylanase, displaying activity on 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-d-cellobioside, p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-cellobioside, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, avicel, xylan, lichenan and sugar cane bagasse.

In this study, GI was immobilized on silica/chitosan hybrid microspheres via simple process through in situ encapsulation. Enhanced rate of reaction was observed when the conversion of glucose to fructose was completed in 10\u00a0min catalyzed by immobilized GI because most GI was located on the shell of the support. Moreover, it was found that immobilized GI exhibited better pH, temperature, ions, storage and operation stability when compared to free GI. The relative enzyme activity was found to be above 90% with a wide pH range of 5.8\u20138.0, temperature range of 40\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C, storage range of 3 months and an increase in operation range of >15 times. Therefore, immobilized GI supported by silica/chitosan hybrid microspheres is an ideal candidate for biocatalysis.",

However, in the current era of genomics and metagenomics, finding and characterizing FAEs is not straightforward, mainly due to a lack of suitable compounds for high-throughput assays. To remedy this, indolyl and 4-nitrocatechol hydroxycinnamates (i.e. trans-ferulate and p-coumarate derivatives) were synthesized in good overall yields \u2013 between 46 and 56% after 4 steps \u2013 and their usefulness as substrates for FAEs was ascertained. The hydrolysis of the ester bond of these chromogenic compounds leads to a colour change, which can be readily monitored.

Since most of the chemically synthesized compounds are produced as racemates their kinetic resolution has been of great interest. For this purpose a number of chemo-enzymatic approaches were proposed. One of such approaches, the use of isolated lipases, is a well-established alternative. Herein we report the kinetic resolutions of 2-Substituted five-membered heteroaromatic rings. By optimizing the reaction conditions it was possible to produce (2-hydroxy)-2-substituted furans and thiophenes in high enantiomeric ratio (E\u00a0>\u00a0200). Thus, racemic mixtures of compounds with slight structural differences were resolved. The current chemo-enzymatic strategy has been applied to a scalable approach leading to the formation of the enantiopure (S)-2i a well-known building block used for the synthesis of bioactive natural compounds.",

Searching for the key spot of a protein is a critically important but time-consuming process. In our previous study, an InDel site neighbouring residue Lys209 of the deep sea bacterial amylase AMY121 was proposed as one putative determinant for thermostability by homology sequence comparison and biochemical analysis [1]. Here, the structural stabilizing role of residue Lys209 was verified, and semi-rational protein design was applied to further improve capacity of higher temperature adaptation. Systematic mutagenesis study on Lys209 of amylase AMY121 revealed that all of the nineteen substitution mutants on the 209th site led to stability loss compared with wild type enzyme, indicating the crucial role of residue Lys209 in protein structural stabilizing. Four Lys209 neighboring sites were then selected and site directed saturation mutagenesis libraries were constructed for high through put thermostability screening. Two thermostability enhanced mutants Y187E and K205L were obtained from 1600 mutant colonies. Temperature properties comparison of wild type AMY121 and its variants showed Y187E and K205L possessed better kinetic thermal stability. The optimum temperature Y187E and K205L both increased by 5\u00a0\u00b0C. T5015 values of Y187E and K205L also increased to 0.63 and 8.52\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.

These amphiphilic compounds receive great attention from cosmetic industry due to a range of beneficial properties for skin. The aminolysis reactions were performed with the esters ethyl linoleate (1) and ethyl salicylate (4) as acyl group donors and the fatty compound N-dodecylamine (2) as the nucleophilic substrate. The aminolysis reactions were carried out in a solvent-free process, which is beneficial from an environmental and economical perspective, at 65\u00a0\u00b0C and reduced pressure (50\u00a0mbar). Parameters as enzyme amount and substrates molar ratios were investigated and the products were monitored by HPLC analysis. The conversion rates were measured through disappearance of ethyl linoleate and ethyl salicylate. The best conversion rates (up to 95%) were obtained by adding an enzyme amount of 5.0\u00a0g/mol of acyl donor group substrate and an equimolar substrates ratio (1:1). The products characterization was performed by High Resolution Mass Spectrometry, Infrared spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Ressonance.

Currently, bacterial and fungal lipases have been widely studied and researched for biodiesel production.

In this paper, extracellular lipase of Botryococcus sudeticus UTEX 2629 (B. sudeticus) was isolated and studied. This is the first time lipase isolated from B. sudeticus is reported. The optimum lipase production condition was analysed by incubating B. sudeticus in various types of oil (palm, corn, canola and olive oils) and under different agitation effects. The highest lipase production was found in the olive oil containing medium with the presence of agitation. The molecular mass of the purified lipase was estimated to be approximately 120\u00a0kDa.

     "abstract": "The pH has a great physiological effect on the catalysis of tyrosinase because protons can act as competitive-type inhibitors. In this work, a reaction mechanism is proposed whereby only the protonation of the free forms Em (met-tyrosinase) and Eox (oxy-tyrosinase) has a significant kinetic effect. The pKa value calculated for tyrosinase is 4.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04. This pKa value could correspond to a residue that acts as a gatekeeper of the active site, controlling the access of the substrate depending on its protonation state. Regarding the location and the nature of the responsible residue, we propose that glutamic acid E322 could be a key residue in the pH effect on the enzyme activity. Moreover, the substrate nature has a large effect on the kinetic behavior as a function of pH, depending on the pKa values of the phenolic hydroxyl groups and, to a lesser extent, on the charge of the R group. The sigmoid behavior of the initial rate vs. pH due to the pKa of the enzyme in the pH range studied could change to a bell-shaped behavior when the pKa values of the hydroxyl groups are low enough, and the R group is negatively charged.

The concentrated enzyme could hydrolyse sardine oil effectively and the reaction conditions were optimized by central composite rotatable design. A hydrolysis ratio of 83.7% was obtained at 72 h with 1000 U of lipase and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 concentration. Urea complexation of the hydrolysed sardine oil enriched the contents of EPA and DHA to 44.3% and 11.6%, which were 2.6 and 1.8 times higher than the initial content of the oil. Spectral properties of the enriched PUFA concentrates were evaluated by ATR-FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. PUFA enrichment using native lipase from yeast Cryptococcus sp. was attempted for the first time in this study.",

N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase and Neu5Ac aldolase were overexpressed in E. coli individually and the activity ratio was optimized by varying recombinant amounts of cell biomass for synthesis of Neu5Ac. Moreover, substrate concentrations and ratio of pyruvate and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and detergent concentrations were optimized to increase product synthesis. The resulting process generated 237.4\u00a0mM Neu5Ac with a yield of 40.0% mol/mol GlcNAc. Furthermore, transporter pathways involved in Neu5Ac and GlcNAc were engineered and their impact on the Neu5Ac synthesis was evaluated. Using a stepwise optimization, an overall whole-cell biocatalytic process was developed and a maximum titer of 260.0\u00a0mM Neu5Ac (80.4\u00a0g/L) with a conversion yield of 43.3% from GlcNAc was achieved.

To overcome this pattern and develop high performance, cost-effective systems, a trend toward a more comprehensive characterization of the heterogeneous bioconversion systems is emerging. This work encompasses such scope. The model system is the immobilization of invertase on glass substrate for the production of invert sugar syrup through sucrose hydrolysis. Before invertase immobilization, the glass substrates were cleaned and hydroxylated; next, substrate functionalization was performed by incubation with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde. Detailed characterization was performed by monitoring every step of the immobilization protocol by contact angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy. Enzyme loading and affinity toward the functionalized substrate was evaluated with a quartz crystal microbalance. The successful deposition of the different coating reagents and of the enzyme was confirmed by the shifts in surface wettability and roughness. XPS highlighted the over-simplistic nature of common models for chemical interaction between layers. Surface saturation was observed for the protein concentration of 0.5\u00a0mg/mL alongside with surface coverage of 910\u00a0ngenzyme/cm2.

A comparison of resulting synthetic and hydrolytic activities after immobilization was performed. Whereas hydrolytic trypsin activity was measured employing N-\u03b1-benzoyl-dl-arginine 4-nitroanilide (BAPNA) assay, synthetic trypsin activity was measured employing a dipeptide synthesis assay. Within spacer-mediated trypsin immobilization, diaminoalkanes, aminoalkanoic acids and biotin spacers showed up to 40% increased synthetic specific activity of trypsin compared to the spacer-free method. Within the hydrolytic reaction type, coupling of trypsin via diaminoalkanes and biotin spacers resulted in a specific activity increase of up to 30%. BSA-bound trypsin displayed only minor increasing effects on both activities of trypsin. Furthermore, protein loading-dependent specific synthetic and hydrolytic activities were evaluated for 8-aminooctanoic acid, 12-aminododecanoic acid and 1,12-diamonododecane as spacers and compared to the direct covalent binding method. The protein binding capacity of spacer-modified particles was lower compared to the direct binding method. Synthetic activity of 8-aminooctanoic acid-bound trypsin was higher than in the case of the spacer-free method over a broad protein loading range with an up to 10-fold increase. The hydrolytic activity was increased by 64% using 8-aminooctanoic acid as spacer within a lower protein loading range.

The purified enzyme assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and gel filtration was approximately 45\u00a0kDa and monomeric. The maximal activity examined using p-nitrophenyl palmitate as a substrate was observed at 98\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 6.0.

     "abstract": "A combined temperature-pH study of urease kinetics was performed with the primary objective to assign the observed pKa values to the ionizable groups of the enzyme active site involved in the reaction. This was done in view of the fact that the identity of the groups detected by pH studies reported in the literature has never been conclusively resolved. Accordingly, herein the urease kinetic parameters KM and vmax were measured at eight pHs between 5.0 and 8.3 in noninteracting biological buffers (MES and HEPES), at each pH at five temperatures between 15 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C. The determined values of pKas and of the enthalpies of ionization \u0394 H ion o allowed the ionizable groups to have the pKas assigned. Unlike previously assumed to have pKa\u00a0\u2248\u00a06.5, the determined acidic pK2\u00a0\u2248\u00a05.0 was assigned to a histidine residue (most likely His320 by Klebsiella aerogenes numbering). By contrast, the basic pK1\u00a0\u2248\u00a08.8 was assigned to the Ni\u2013Ni bridging hydroxyl ion, a feature that supports the mechanism operative in the urease activity in which this hydroxyl is a general acid. Further, the pH-dependent analysis of the obtained KM and vmax values revealed that even though both the thermodynamic and activation parameters of the urease reaction were little pH-dependent, their values indicated that the most favorable conditions for the substrate binding are at pH 5.5\u20136.0, and those for the catalytic step, at pH 6.5\u20137.0. Taken together, the work brings in new mechanistic information of significance to the understanding of the activity of urease.",

The reaction sequence significantly improves the aldol cleavage of d-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (d-F16BP) catalyzed by RAMA and yields 100% conversion of d-F16BP by overcoming thermodynamic limitation. The degradation kinetics of d-GAP under reaction conditions was investigated and a reaction kinetics model defining the entire cascade was developed. Validation of the model shows 98.5% correlation between experimental data and numerically simulated data matrices. The evaluation of different types of reactor was performed by combining the reaction kinetics model, mass balances and kinetics of the non-enzymatic degradation of d-GAP. Batch-wise operation in a stirred tank reactor (STR) is the most convenient procedure for the one-pot enzymatic syntheses of d-GAP and sn-G3P. The separation of the two products d-GAP and sn-G3P has been achieved using polyethylenimine (PEI)-cellulose TLC.",

Endophytic microorganisms, in particular are emerging as potential sources of l-asparaginases.The current work involves partial purification and characterization of l-asparaginase from Talaromyces pinophilus, an endophytic fungus isolated from the rhizomes of Curcuma amada. Maximum enzyme activity could be achieved at pH 8.0 and with temperature 28\u00a0\u00b0C. The enzyme Exhibits 95 % and 98% of its total activity at physiological pH and temperature, respectively. The enzyme activity is largely unhindered in the presence of metal ions such as Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+. Increase in the enzyme activity in the presence of thiol groups and reduction in the same upon addition of thiol blockers indicates the involvement of cysteine in the enzyme\u2019s catalytic activity. The enzyme is a heterodimer of 62\u00a0kDa and 39\u00a0kDa. The enzyme has a Km of 6.4\u00a0mM, its turnover number towards l-asparagine is 286.3\u00a0s\u22121.

Therefore, a novel \u03b2-glucosidase gene encodes a protein (BglA) of 446 amino acid, belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1), was cloned from a hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga naphthophila RKU-10T and over-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21CodonPlus. An extracellular BglA with a molecular weight of 51.50\u00a0kDa, was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography after heat treatment. Purified enzyme displayed optimal activity at pH 7.0 and 95\u00a0\u00b0C. It was quite stable over a broad range of pH (6.0 \u20139.0) and temperature (60\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C), fairly stable up to 8\u00a0h at 80\u00a0\u00b0C. Enzyme activity was stimulated by glucose concentration up to 600\u00a0mM and exhibited high glucose tolerance with a Ki value of 1200\u00a0mM.

     "abstract": "Chiral amines are important building blocks in the pharmaceutical industry, and the biocatalytic synthesis of these compounds using \u03c9-transaminases has been increasingly studied in recent years. In principal, asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines from a prochiral ketone is the preferable route, but it is often hampered by an unfavourable equilibrium position and product inhibition. An effective method for product removal is therefore necessary to drive the reaction towards product formation. In a recent study (Rehn et al., 2014) [29] we reported on the successful use of a supported liquid membrane (SLM) for the in situ product removal (ISPR) of (S)-\u03b1-methylbenzylamine (MBA) produced by Arthrobacter citreus \u03c9-transaminase present in immobilized Escherichia coli cells.In the present work, we thoroughly discuss the factors influencing the performance of the SLM system and considerations for its successful use. Moreover, the system is further improved by implementing continuous control of the reactor pH using the amine donor substrate, and regeneration of the SLM unit at regular intervals to maintain the extraction performance, allowing the accumulation of 1.0\u00a0M (121\u00a0g/l) product in the stripping phase during operation for 91\u00a0h.",

Immobilised enzymes offer well-known advantages over soluble enzyme preparations, including an enhanced control of the reaction process and enzyme-free products. The immobilisation was performed using carbodiimide on commercially available magnetic beads.The immobilised glycosidases were compared with the free enzymes with respect to pH, temperature, ethanol content, glucose and fructose concentrations, stability over time and kinetic parameters (KM and kcat). The stability parameters of the immobilised enzymes in acid buffer and wine were very high, and there were no shifts in the enzyme activities under different characteristics.

In this study, we investigate gTG2-catalyzed peptide bond formation between various amino acid-derived donor and acceptor substrates.

An aromatic ester of Gly was the most efficient acyl-donor substrate tested; aromatic esters of d-Ala and l-Ala showed 50-fold lower reactivity or no reactivity, respectively. A computational strategy combining computational protein design algorithms and molecular dynamics simulations was developed to model the binding modes of donor substrates in the gTG2 active site. We show that the inability of gTG2 to efficiently catalyze peptide synthesis from donors containing alanine results from the narrow substrate binding tunnel, which prevents bulkier donors from adopting a catalytically productive binding mode.

Employing merely 0.1\u00a0g recombinant RpCR-GDH in a toluene-aqueous biphasic system, as much as 7.0\u00a0g COBE could be asymmetrically reduced into ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate [(S)-CHBE] (>99% ee) without addition of external cofactor, achieving molar isolation yield of 91%, substrate to biocatalyst ratio of 70 and space-time yield of 1480\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0d\u22121.

An Escherichia coli\u2013 Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector (pHS-CotG-nit) was constructed for the spore surface display of the nitrilase from hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima MSB8. The successful display of CotG-nit fusion protein on the spore surface of B. subtilis was verified by western blot analysis and activity measurement. The optimal temperature and pH of the spore surface-dispalyed nitrilase were observed to be 50\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 8.0, respectively, which were higher than the free nitrilase (45\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 7.5). The analysis of thermal and pH stability indicated that the spore surface-displayed nitrilase retained 79% and 97% at 75\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 8.0 after 1\u00a0h of incubation, whereas it were 32% and 52%, respectively, for free nitrilase. Furthermore, the reusability experiments indicated that the activity of the spore surface-displayed nitrilase was not significantly decreased throughout the reusability process, which still retained 83% of the initial activity at the fifth cycle. Above all, these results suggested that surface display of enzymes on the spore of B. subtilis might be an effective method for enzyme immobilization and help to meet the ever-increasing industrial demand for preparation and stabilization of biocatalysts.",

However, pre-treatment by-products, such as sugar and lignin degradation products, can negatively affect the performance of hydrolytic (mannanolytic) enzymes. In this study, two monomeric sugars, five sugar degradation products, five lignin derivatives and four liquors from biomass feedstocks pre-treated by different technologies, were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on mannanolytic enzymes (\u03b1-galactosidases, \u03b2-mannanases and \u03b2-mannosidases). Lignin derivatives elicited the greatest inhibitory effect on the mannanolytic enzymes, followed by organic acids and furan derivatives derived from sugar degradation. Lignin derivative inhibition appeared to be as a result of protein\u2013phenolic complexation, leading to protein precipitating out of solution. The functional groups on the phenolic lignin derivatives appeared to be directly related to the ability of the phenolic to interfere with enzyme activity, with the phenolic containing the highest hydroxyl group content exhibiting the greatest inhibition. It was also demonstrated that various pre-treatment technologies render different pre-treatment soluble by-products which interact in various ways with the mannanolytic enzymes. The different types of biomass (i.e. different plant species) were also shown to release different by-products that interacted with the mannanolytic enzymes in a diverse manner even when the biomass was pre-treated using the same technology. Enzyme inhibition by pre-treatment by-products can be alleviated through the removal of these compounds prior to enzymatic hydrolysis to maximize enzyme activity.",

Rheological analysis of the succinoglycans in terms of concentration (0.5\u2fff2.0%), temperature (5\u2fff75\u00a0\u00b0C) and pH (2.5\u2fff10.0) revealed non-Newtonian and shear thinning behavior of the biopolymer. The technique of immobilization in loofa sponge and use of sugar cane molasses as a low cost carbon source produced significant and effective results for the industrial production of succinoglycan.",

The optima reaction conditions for free and immobilized pectinase were pH 3.5 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 4.5 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. During the evaluation of storage stability of immobilized derivative at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, a hyperactivation of enzyme activity was observed, with an increase of 98% on the initial activity after 229 days of storage. The study of thermal stability showed that the immobilization exerted a protective effect to the enzyme submitted to high temperatures, probably due to a result of the microenvironment created inside the RFPU. The kinetic parameters showed that the immobilization process did not change the affinity of the enzyme by the substrate. The immobilized pectinase in RFPU was reused consecutively by 6 catalytic cycles in the hydrolysis of pectic oligosaccharides, keeping 35% of its initial activity. Due to the good performance of the enzymatic derivative, this presents a potential alternative to be used in the conception of industrial reactors.",

We call this descriptor T50. Aspergillus niger transglucosidase had the lowest T50 value (30\u00a0mM) and produced panose as the major product from maltose with a 69% yield after 6\u00a0h. With a longer incubation time, secondary hydrolysis occurred and isomaltose could be obtained with a 65% yield.

For heteromolecular reactions a number of different aminated five- and six-membered aromatic compounds were used. The first reaction type involved the oxidation of catechol, 3- or 4-methylcatechol to o-quinone and subsequent Michael-addition of the amino compounds with CN bond formation. Conclusive analytical data (UV\u2fffvis data, MS spectra) for the respective o-quinone are provided. The second type of reaction included a homo-intermolecular dimerization probably with C-C and CO bond formation to the proposed dibenzofuran derivatives. The heteromolecular reaction with the amino compounds yielded trimers consisting of homomolecular dimers and the amino compound connected via a CN bond. The third reaction type started from epinephrine (adrenaline) which was oxidized by laccase and underwent an intramolecular Michael-addition to adrenochrome.

     "abstract": "In this work we have shown for the first time the effect of Met65Thr substitution on the activity of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) from Planococcus sp. strain S5. Even though the 3D model does not reveal the influence of an amino acid substitution on the enzyme active site structure, the Thr65 variant differed in lower pH optimum and lower Km from the wild type enzyme. Activity measurements with various catechols as the substrates showed almost 1.5-times higher activity of the mutant protein in comparison to the wild type enzyme against 4-methylcatechol and its remarkably high activity towards 4-chlorocatechol. From the computational studies it follows that the difference in activity of the wild type and mutant form of C23O towards 4-chlorocatechol is most likely linked to the shift of the pH optimum caused by the presence of the two additional H-bonds between Ser307 and Thr65 which anchor the C-terminal fragment of the protein. This work reveals the role of the N-terminal domain, which is considered to be catalytically inactive, in modulation of the C23O activity and the obtained results may facilitate the engineering of C23Os for bioremediation of environments contaminated with chloroaromatic compounds.",

In order to reduce biodiesel production cost, development of stable enzymes under extreme conditions is one of the important prominences. To this end, the properties of a lipase of Cryptococcus diffluens D44, isolated from petroleum sludge, has been investigated. Crude extracellular D44 lipase showed maximal activity at pH 9.0 and 45\u00a0\u00b0C. Half-life of the enzyme at 30, 40, 50 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C was 79.67, 45.90, 39.16 and 2\u00a0min, respectively. Activation energy of p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) hydrolysis was 30.13\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u2fff1. D44 lipase was active within a broad range of pH from 6.0 to 10.0 with the optimum pH at 9.0. SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF fingerprint analyses revealed the molecular weight of the enzyme to be 45.7\u00a0kDa. Its inhibition with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) indicated that D44 lipase requires metal ions as cofactors.

The use of sn-1,3 specific lipases adds an even more interesting feature to this process, which is related to the possibility of maintaining the sn-2 fatty acid composition of natural substrates unaltered. The pursuit of this characteristic in interesterified products by sn-1,3 specific lipases could be threatened by a chemical reaction, the acyl migration whithin mono- and diacylglycerols. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of this undesired reaction in a soybean oil:fully hydrogenated soybean oil enzymatic interesterified blend. Once acyl migration was confirmed to occur, the influence of different reaction parameters -namely enzyme type and concentration, substrate ratio, and addition of hexane and temperature effect- was studied. Lipozyme TL IM demonstrated an enhancer acyl migration effect compared to Lipozyme RM IM, effect that was hypothesized to be correlated with the immobilization support material of the former (silica gel). Acyl migration was also promoted by the increase of biocatalyst concentration in reaction media. On the contrary, the presence of hexane, together with a decrease in temperature reaction, reduced its occurrence. A temperature effect analysis performed in solvent reaction media demonstrated its promoter effect on acyl migration.",

A wide variety of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ionic liquids have been synthesized in order to investigate their effects on both enzyme activity and stability.

In the present work, the effect of alkyl chain length of [CnMIM][Br] (n\u00a0=\u00a02, 4, 6, 12) on hydrolytic activity of Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus lipase (TTL), as a model enzyme, was evaluated and compared with [C4MIM][PF6] as a hydrophobic ionic liquid. Moreover, effect of hydrophilic ILs on the activity and thermal stability of TTL in different concentrations of ionic liquids was studied. The results showed that TTL had the highest lipase activity in the presence of 0.3\u00a0M [C2MIM][Br], 1\u00a0M [C4MIM][Br] and 0.3\u00a0M [C6MIM][Br].

Then further incubation of the oriented enzyme led to irreversible covalent attachment via the reaction of the nucleophilic groups of ROL and the remaining epoxy groups of the supports. In the other approach in order to perform oriented/multipoint covalent immobilization, ROL was modified by chemical amination to introduce new amino groups with lower pkb values. After the initially adsorption of the aminated enzyme on the heterofunctional supports, the oriented enzyme was further incubated at pH 9.2 to promote additional covalent linkages between the chemically introduced amino groups and the supports. The results showed higher thermal/co-solvent stability of the preparations of aminated ROL compared to the immobilized derivatives of not-aminated ROL. The immobilized derivatives were used in selective hydrolysis of fish oil in order to investigate the effect of immobilization procedure on selectivity of ROL. All the derivatives discriminated between cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in favor of EPA. Considerable improvement in selectivity (16.1:1) was obtained by oriented/multipoint immobilization of aminated ROL on SBA-15.",

In the present study, the possibility of enzyme catalysed kinetic resolution was investigated. Screening of a number of hydrolytic enzymes showed the crude pig liver esterase (PLE) to exhibit modest enantioselectivity in the hydrolysis of racemic clopidogrel. Molecular modeling simulations were applied on the homology model of PLE-1, the major isoenzyme in the crude PLE, and distinct sites of mutations were proposed and produced in the laboratory. The PLE-1 variants with one mutation i.e. PLE-1-F407L and PLE-1-F407I resolved the racemic substrate yielding the (R)-isomer with E value >100.

The subunit of EbSDR8 is composed of 250 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26.4\u00a0kDa. Important properties regarding the application of EbSDR8 include utilization of cheaper coenzyme, the excellent catalytic performance over a broad pH range from 7.0 to 10.5, and temperature optimum of 35\u00a0\u00b0C.

The reaction of acetic anhydride with 1-butanol to give short chain ester butyl acetate was chosen as a model reaction. Results showed that selected ILs (choline glycinate, choline alaninate, choline asparaginate, choline malate) and DESs (choline chloride mixtures with glycerol Gly, ethylene glycol EG, and urea U as hydrogen bond donors in molar ratio 1:2) are poor media for tested reaction if applied as pure solvents (yield <5%). This happens probably due to the substrate \u2fffentrapment\u2fff within DES structure through H-bonding. The addition of water (as a protic solvent) to the DESs strongly enhances both enzyme activity and reaction yield. Among different DES:water mixtures tested, the one with EG as hydrogen bond donor at water content of 5% (w/w) proved to be the most effective, resulting in esterification yield 80% (higher than yield obtained in a reference solvent n-heptane).

Various polysaccharides were tested to encapsulate FSAwt and pre-immobilised FSAwt in LDH (FSAwt@Mg2Al-LDH). \u03b9-Carrageenan appears as the most suitable candidate to prepare biohybrid beads. The retained activities in \u03b9-carrageenan beads were measured for both free FSAwt and immobilised FSAwt revealing a 3 fold higher activity in favour of the pre-immobilised FSA.

However, a biochemical characterization of the Flavourzyme peptidases is difficult, because obtaining purified proteins is essential when functional and structural characterization studies are targeted. Key enzyme activities (three endopeptidases, two aminopeptidases, two dipeptidyl peptidases) have recently been identified and isolated from this commercially available enzyme preparation. The impact and the synergism of theses peptidases on the complex wheat gluten hydrolysis are yet unclear. However, the knowledge about the latter is crucial for an efficient protein hydrolysis. In the present study, we determined the product inhibition for the seven isolated peptidases and analyzed the impact of each peptidase on the wheat gluten hydrolysis using response surface methodology. In general, both aminopeptidases and the three endopeptidases were of major importance. One of the endopeptidases (alkaline protease 1) was least affected by product inhibition and showed the highest effect on the wheat gluten hydrolysis. In the case of the aminopeptidases, the leucine aminopeptidase 2 showed a higher impact on the hydrolysis compared to the leucine aminopeptidase A, but exhibited the highest product inhibition sensitivity. The dipeptidyl peptidases were of only minor impact on the wheat gluten hydrolysis. To conclude, six out of the seven peptidases contributed significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) to the wheat gluten hydrolysis and should be considered when designing such a process.",

     "abstract": "d-Threonine is one of the important unnatural amino acids used as chiral building blocks in pharmaceutical drugs. Owing to the presence of two chiral centers, a synthetic protocol, either through chemocatalysis or biocatalysis, has not yet been available for one-step preparation of stereochemically pure d-threonine in terms of enantiomeric and diastereomeric excesses (i.e., both >99%). Here we demonstrate that facile production of d-threonine can be implemented using threonine deaminase (TD) via kinetic resolution of dl-threonine that can be readily prepared by conventional organic synthesis. TD catalyzes the dehydration/deamination of l-threonine, leading to generation of 2-oxobutyrate and ammonia. In contrast to mild substrate inhibition of the TD activity by l-threonine (i.e., apparent inhibition constant ( K I app )\u00a0=\u00a0950\u00a0mM), d-threonine turned out to be a strong inhibitor (i.e., K I app =\u00a041\u00a0mM). In addition to the enzyme inhibitions by both enantiomers of threonine, cell lysis observed during small-scale kinetic resolutions of \u2fe51\u00a0M dl-threonine led us to carry out a preparative-scale reaction at 500\u00a0mM racemic substrate.

Product isolation by a cation-exchange chromatography led to white solid of d-threonine (1.36\u00a0g, 90.7% isolation yield). To explore whether our strategy could afford coproduction of another valuable unnatural amino acid, the pass-through solution from the cation-exchange column was further processed by a \u03ff-transaminase (\u03ff-TA) reaction where 2-oxobutyrate was converted to enantiopure homoalanine using isopropylamine as an amino donor.

A biphasic system (isopropyl ether/isooctane/aqueous) was used, in which the product 3-(1\u2ff2-naphthyloxy)-propane-1,2-diol (2) precipitated instantly, facilitating its separation and increasing the enantiopurity of (R)-2 (>99.5% ee). This enzymatic resolution had a total turnover number of 70,000, affording enantiopure epoxide (S)-1 (>99% ee) and 1,2-diol (R)-2 (>99% ee) in 45.3% and 42.4% yields, respectively. (R)-2 and (S)-1 were subsequently converted to (R)- and (S)-propranolol (3) (>99% ee) in overall yields of 31.4% and 44.8%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best case for enzymatic resolution of rac-1 using an epoxide hydrolase, giving high space-time yields [136\u00a0g\u00a0L\u2fff1\u00a0days\u2fff1 for (S)-1 and 139\u00a0g\u00a0L\u2fff1\u00a0days\u2fff1 for (R)-2] under mild reaction conditions.

Using the esterification production of menthyl butyrate as a reaction model, evaluation on the catalytic efficiency of the three lipases was performed. It was found that Leu evidently improved the catalytic activity of the Q114L lipase, achieving the highest conversions of menthyl butyrate under varying experimental conditions that may be attributable to its lower total energy when compared with both the T1 and Q114M lipases. The diminishing catalytic activity of T1 lipase observable following substitution with Met (Q114M lipase) may be due to formation of three additional cavities within the vicinity of the mutation, lesser density of the protein core and susceptibility to high temperature, particularly under prolonged reaction time. Therefore, it can be concluded that the substitution of Leu into the oxyanion-114 had rendered favorable structural changes that enhanced the catalytic activity of the T1 lipase, envisaging that such approach may also be of applied value for improving the catalytic activity of other bacterial lipases within the I.5 family.",

The impact of the amount of initial CALB was also explored.

Nominal quantity of APTS did not affect catalyst\u2fffs activity when used in combination with GLUT. Additional studies demonstrated that stability during storage was mainly dependent on the enzyme loading. The optimum biocatalyst was reused six cycles without mass loss. Biocatalyst\u2fffs performance decreased with reuse. Mechanisms justifying these results were proposed.The role of GLUT and APTS on stability during storage and on differences between initial enzymatic activity and the performance in the reaction after two months was discussed. The problem of mixed interaction of CALB (covalent bonding plus simple adsorption) was carefully addressed to explain leaching of the lipase.Leaching and stability on storage should be included in the analysis of modifiers impact when support\u2fffs modifiers are used.

In recent papers, there have been attempts to modify its structure and thereby alter its features and activity. In this work, proteolytic modification of laccase isoforms was performed. To achieve the goal, commercially available proteases: proteinase K, trypsin, pepsin, papain, and Rhizopus pepsin were applied. The results obtained proved that only proteinase K was able to digest laccase resulting in lowering its activities to only 7%. The other four proteases enhanced the activities of this multicopper oxidoreductase up to 140%. Proteolytic modification of laccase structure resulted also in enhancement of its prooxidative potential. Moreover, analysis of kinetic constants proved that Vmax of modified laccase increased over 2 times, the highest kcat (321.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.83\u00a0L/s) was observed when analyzing laccase incubated with pepsin from Rhizopus. The electrochemical investigations of anodic peak (650\u00a0mV vs Ag/AgCl), and cathodic peak (400\u00a0mV) showed that pepsine-treated laccase had 2 times higher peaks than trypsin digested and four times higher than control experiment. Additionally, the remaining forms seem to inhibit proteolytic activities leaving even only 20% of its initial activity.",

In this study, we explore and discuss the laccase isoform diversity of Trametes versicolor under submerged culture conditions. Oak sawdust was used as a natural, abundant and cheap source of laccase inducers. Two laccase bands (lcc1 and lcc2) were detected by SDS-PAGE zymography. Lcc2 exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 100\u00a0kDa, and was purified to its characteristic blue color for biochemical characterization. Lcc2 displayed high affinities toward all the substrates used in this study (0.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0043, 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.053, 2.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53 and 3.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85\u00a0mM, for ABTS, DMP, GUA and SYR, respectively). Isoelectric focusing analysis of this band revealed the presence of 5 distinct laccase isoforms. The suggested existence of different laccase heterodimers in lcc2 may have had an influence on its catalyzing capacity. Laccase isoform diversity was corroborated by molecular characterization of 5 allelic mRNA sequences. Multiple alignment analysis, 3-dimensional mapping and theoretical sequence-structure-function assumptions suggests that the newly characterized alleles would most likely display diversity in their biochemical behavior if functionally expressed.",

Free lipase NS81006 has been demonstrated to be capable of efficiently catalyzing the methanolysis of soybean oils and further kinetic study is of great significant to reveal the related mechanism of free lipase catalysis. In this paper, the kinetic models based on Ping-Pong Bi Bi mechanism were proposed in lipase-mediated alcoholysis process for biodiesel production. The whole model was calculated from separate reaction blocks including hydrolysis, esterification and transesterification, and Matlab was used to estimate the kinetic constants by fitting experimental data of the conversion of soybean oil. It was found that in the process of NS81006-catalyzed methanolysis of soybean oil, the hydrolysis followed by esterification as well as the methanolysis would occur simultaneously. The inhibitory effect of methanol on free lipase could also be observed from the relative high inhibition constant of methanol compared with other equilibrium constants. Moreover, as it can be seen from the simulated results, the enzymatic rate constants for direct transesterification are much greater than those for hydrolysis, indicating that transesterification is a more dominant reaction pathway for the free lipase NS81006 mediated biodiesel production.",

This hydroxyketone is so far only accessible in biocatalytic reductions starting at low substrate concentrations. To improve this biotransformation, two thermostable dehydrogenases for the production of the hydroxyketone with coupled cofactor regeneration were co-expressed in Escherichia coli and applied in a whole-cell catalytic approach. A putative 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (HBD) derived from Thermus thermophilus HB8 was identified as S-selective enzyme for reduction of 2,5-hexanedione to (5S)-hydroxyhexane-2-one. This enzyme is resistant to high concentrations of 2,5-hexanedione. In the biotransformations, initial substrate concentrations of up to 250\u00a0mM 2,5-hexanedione were shown to be converted by the catalyst. To our knowledge, optically pure (5S)-hydroyhexane-2-one at a final concentration of 169\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mM has never been produced in a biocatalytic batch process before. This concentration corresponds to a space-time-yield of 3.9\u00a0g/L/h. The application of calcium carbonate as buffering compound was a key for the production of those high product titers. Therefore, the thermostable whole-cell catalyst investigated in this study is superior to published catalysts for the production of (5S)-hydroxyhexane-2-one.",

In this paper, the production of d-p-hydroxyphenylglycine by using these biocatalysts is optimized taking into account the special features of this system (low enzyme stability and both substrate poor solubility and low stability with temperature). The best operational conditions to produce d-p-hydroxyphenylglycine are identified. Moreover, the encapsulation allows us to carry out the reaction in heterogeneous conditions and to reuse the biocatalysts 3 and 5 times without losing their activity for biocatalyst V-II and V-I, respectively. Finally, the encapsulation dramatically protects the enzymatic activity during lyophilization improving biocatalysts storage.",

Subsequently, two different whole-cell setups (resting and growing cells) were tested in two different host organisms (Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expressing CYP BM3. It was found that resting E. coli whole cells produced the highest amounts of products and therefore this biocatalytic setup was further optimized for application in a laboratory-scale fermentor.

Such thiolases could serve as powerful carbon\u2013carbon bond-forming biocatalysts in vitro if handles less costly than CoA were employable. Here, thiolase activity is demonstrated toward substrates linked to the readily-available CoA mimic, N-acetylcysteamine (NAC). ReBktB was observed to catalyze the retro-Claisen condensation of several \u03b2-ketoacyl-S-NAC substrates, with a preference for 3-oxopentanoyl-S-NAC over 3-oxobutanoyl-, 3-oxohexanoyl-, and 3-oxoheptanoyl-S-NAC. A 2.0\u00a0\u00c5-resolution crystal structure, in which the asymmetric unit consists of four ReBktB tetramers, provides insight into acyl group specificity and how it may be engineered. By replacing an active site methionine with an alanine, a mutant possessing significant activity towards \u03b1-methyl substituted, NAC-linked substrates was engineered. The ability of ReBktB and its engineered mutants to utilize NAC-linked substrates will facilitate the in vitro biocatalytic synthesis of diketide chiral building blocks from feedstock molecules such as acetate and propionate.",

     "abstract": "A recently proposed coenzyme regeneration system employing laccase and a number of various redox mediators for the oxidation of NAD(P)H was studied in detail by kinetic characterization of individual reaction steps. Reaction engineering by modeling was used to optimize the employed enzyme, coenzyme as well as redox mediator concentrations. Glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus sp. served as a convenient model of synthetic enzymes that depend either on NAD+ or NADP+. The suitability of laccase from Trametes pubescens in combination with acetosyringone or syringaldazine as redox mediator was tested for the regeneration (oxidation) of both coenzymes. In a first step, pH profiles and catalytic constants of laccase for the redox mediators were determined. Then, second-order rate constants for the oxidation of NAD(P)H by the redox mediators were measured. In a third step, the rate equation for the entire enzymatic process was derived and used to build a MATLAB model. After verifying the agreement of predicted vs. experimental data, the model was used to calculate different scenarios employing varying concentrations of regeneration system components. The modeled processes were experimentally tested and the results compared to the predictions. It was found that the regeneration of NADH to its oxidized form was performed very efficiently, but that an excess of laccase activity leads to a high concentration of the oxidized form of the redox mediator \u2013 a phenoxy radical \u2013 which initiates coupling (dimerization or polymerization) and enzyme deactivation.",

     "abstract": "Galactose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.9) is a single copper metalloenzyme, having a molecular weight of 65\u201368\u00a0kDa. Galactose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols to corresponding aldehydes with strict regioselectivity, and the selectivity is high for the galactose C-6 primary hydroxyl group. The oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds is one of the most important reactions in synthetic chemistry, thus enzymatic biocatalysis requiring only molecular oxygen as an oxidant is a valuable alternative to chemical reagents.We review here the various mono-, oligo- and polysaccharide derivatives that have been synthesized by galactose oxidase-catalyzed reactions, and the several either qualitative or quantitative analytical techniques utilized to follow of the reaction, determine the conversion, and identify the products. The optimal reaction conditions, the formation of side products, and the oxidation of substrates other than carbohydrates are discussed. Finally, we summarize engineering efforts of galactose oxidase that have improved recombinant enzyme expression and yield, or altered substrate specificity.",

Since the non-enzymatic side reactions could be reduced in acid conditions, slightly acidic pH optimum is one of the main issues for biological production of d-psicose. In this study, we first characterized an acidic ketose 3-epimerase, the recombinant d-psicose 3-epimerase (DPEase) from Dorea sp. CAG317. The protein exhibited high amino acid sequence identity with other reported DPEases, and was determined as a homotetramer with subunit molecular weight approximately 33\u00a0kDa, which was the same as other reported findings. The recombinant DPEase was a metal-dependent enzyme with the optimum metal cofactor as Co2+. In presence of 1\u00a0mM of Co2+, the enzyme displayed the maximal activity as 803\u00a0U/mg at pH 6.0 and 70\u00a0\u00b0C. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was measured to be 412 and 199\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0min\u22121 toward d-psicose and d-fructose, respectively. The equilibrium ratio between d-fructose and d-psicose was approximately 30:70, and the elevated temperature did not significantly shift the equilibrium toward d-psicose. Compared to other reported DPEases, the recombinant Dorea sp.

     "abstract": "The lipase of Serratia marcescens (SML), containing 614 amino acid residues and belonging to the lipase family I.3, has an important pharmaceutical application in production of chiral precursors. Similar to other members of this family, the SML consists of the N-catalytic domain (\u03b1/\u03b2) that contains the active-site residues and the C-terminal domain that includes the two parallel \u03b2-roll domains, the first and second \u03b2-roll. The repetitive sequences, a nine-residue sequence motif (GGXGXDXUX), in SML are somewhat degenerated as well as not consecutive. The parallel \u03b2-roll domains are separated from each other by a 72-residue spacer. The importance of these repetitive sequences has not been fully understood yet. In the present investigation, as an approach, a C-terminally truncated (\u223c13\u00a0kD) SML was generated using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based site-directed mutagenesis method (designated SML-\u0394128). Both wild-type and truncated forms of SML were constructed, overexpressed in Escherichia coli without the Lip system and purified by affinity chromatography on the Ni-NTA system. The kinetic parameters and circular dichroism (CD) spectra were determined and compared. The SML-\u0394128 showed an approximately 3.7-fold increase in the turnover rate (kcat), relative to that of the full-length enzyme. In conclusion, this report demonstrates that the SML could tolerate extensive modification in the C-terminal extreme of the protein, as deletion of the C-terminal region (\u223c13\u00a0kDa), which consists of several tandem repeats of glycine-rich and 49 residues including the signal peptide, significantly increases the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.",

In this optimization study, the effect of water, t-butanol and water adsorbent content on the yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was considered. Complete conversion to FAMEs was achieved under optimum conditions for CALB immobilized on epoxy-functionalized silica (Silica-CALB); 30% (w/w) t-butanol by substrate weight, reaction time of 96\u00a0h, 50\u00a0\u00b0C and molar ratio of methanol to oil 3:1, which was added to the reaction mixture in three steps. In general by adding t-butanol to the reaction medium, the conversion of oil to FAME increased for RML immobilized on epoxy-functionalized silica (Silica-RML) and 50\u00a0wt.% t-butanol by substrate weight gave the best yield. TLL immobilized on epoxy-functionalized silica (Silica-TLL) reach to 100% yield at 10% t-butanol. Water suppresses the methanolysis reaction catalyzed by Silica-CALB but significantly increased FAME yield for Silica-TLL and Silica-RML. It was observed that at high water adsorbent amounts (more than 55%, w/w), conversion to FAME decreased possibly due to mass transfer limitation. The immobilized TLL was quite stable and can be reused for 16 cycles without significant loss in activity (95%). The immobilized preparations of RML and CALB also presented a good reusability, keeping 85% of their initial activities after 16 cycles of the reaction.",

Previously we have established automated microwell methods for rapid data collection and hybrid kinetic modelling techniques for quantification of kinetic constants. In this work these methods are applied to explore the substrate selectivity and kinetics of monoamine oxidase, MAO-N-D5, from Aspergillus niger. In particular we examine the MAO-N-D5 variant Ile246Met/Asn336Ser/Met348Lys/Thr384Asn to allow the oxidation of secondary amines Initial screening showed that MAO-N-D5 enabled the selective oxidation of secondary amines in 8 and 9 carbon rings, as well as primary ethyl and propyl amines attached to secondary amines of indolines and pyrrolidines. Subsequently we developed a first kinetic model for the MAO-N-D5 enzyme based on the ping-pong bi-bi mechanism (similar to that for the human MAO-A enzyme). The full set of kinetic parameters were then established for three MAO-N-D5 substrates namely; 3-azabicyclo[3,3,0]octane, 1-(2 amino ethyl) pyrrolidine and 3-(2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-1-yl)propan-1-amine. The models for each amine substrate showed excellent agreement with experimentally determined progress curves over a range of operating conditions. They indicated that in each case amine inhibition was the main determinant of overall reaction rate rather than oxygen or imine (product) inhibition. From the perspective of larger scale bioconversion process design, the models indicated the need for fed-batch addition of the amine substrate and to increase the dissolved oxygen levels in order to maximize bioconversion process productivity.",

Results of the modeling showed that immobilization did not change inactivation pathways of the met- and oxy-forms of tyrosinase and that the activation energies of unfolding were quite similar to those of the native enzyme. The estimated inactivation rate constants indicated that the met-form was considerably less prone to thermal inactivation and that both forms were far less susceptible to thermal unfolding than native tyrosinase.

The alcoholysis reaction was catalyzed using Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (Lipozyme TL IM) and was carried out both in solvent-free medium and using tert-butanol to increase lipase stability. Studies were carried out to determine the influence of the reaction time and the lipase/oil ratio. The tuna oil\u2019s DHA content was trebled (from 26 to 78\u00a0wt%) using isobutanol as the acyl acceptor while carrying out the alcoholysis reactions in solvent-free medium. However, under these conditions, the lipase was partially deactivated given that the conversion rate decreased by around 80% after catalyzing six successive reactions using the same lipase batch. With tert-butanol as the reaction medium, the lipase was more stable but the resulting DHA concentrations were lower: 56% with isobutanol and dodecanol (59% with dodecanol in solvent-free medium) and 42.5% with ethanol (47.5 % without solvent).",

Both the activity and stability were found to be enhanced in presence of the surfactant at low concentration (1\u2013125\u00a0\u03bcM) followed by inhibition at high concentration. The activity increased by 80% and thermal deactivation temperature raised by 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C.

Deactivation at high concentration correlated with greater structural changes depicted by spectroscopic studies. Isothermal titration calorimetric studies showed the binding to be spontaneous in nature involving non-covalent interactions. High negative value of entropy signifies exposure of hydrophobic domains and increase in structural rigidity, which correlates with active site being more accessible and rigid in presence of the surfactant.

Of the conditions tested, levan formation reached the highest value at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0g/L sucrose. The increase of temperature (40\u00a0\u00b0C) and sucrose concentration (600\u00a0g/L) caused a significant decrease of the levan concentration and a higher production of FOS. However, an increase of the temperature also caused an enhancement of the undesired hydrolytic activity. Several inulin-type FOS (1-kestose, nystose, 1F-fructosylnystose), neoFOS (blastose, neokestose, neonystose) and levan-type FOS (6-kestose, 6,6-nystose) were synthesized by levansucrase. The latter compound was purified and characterized by mass spectrometry and 2D NMR. Using 600\u00a0g/L sucrose at 40\u00a0\u00b0C, the maximum yield of FOS was reached at 85% sucrose conversion; at this point, the reaction mixture contained (in weight basis) 31% glucose, 14% fructose, 15% sucrose and 40% FOS (including a small contribution of levan).",

In addition, lag time kinetics altered seriously guaiacol peroxidase tests. A part of 80% of ecotypes showed lag time kinetics with guaiacol substrate versus 10% for o-dianisidine. Filtered extracts on Sephadex G-25, containing low amounts of small molecules (such as antioxidants), did not show lag phases. This data support the hypothesis of involvement of small size antioxidants in the appearance of lag time. At this semi-purification level, the enzyme showed low affinity towards guaiacol. In addition, adding ascorbic acid (AsA) as exogenous antioxidant, to the guaiacol peroxidase reaction medium, led to the reappearance of lag time, where its increase follows increases in AsA concentrations. A positive correlation (coefficient 0.86) between lag times and AsA concentrations was established. The addition of copper (known as oxidant of ascorbic acid) in the reaction mixture affected the lag phase behaviour. At a final concentration of 0.5\u20131.0\u00a0mM, Copper abolished completely a lag time of about 120\u00a0s, allowing guaiacol peroxidase reaction to start immediately. Electrophoretic analysis of acidic peroxidases on 6\u201315% gradient polyacrylamide gels followed by in situ revelation using reaction mixtures containing 0.5\u20131.0\u00a0mM Cu++, allowed the appearance of new fast isoforms (Rf 0.66\u20130.68) which are absents in controls.

Lipase from Candida rugosa was immobilized on various cellulose/lignin hydrogel beads. The results showed that lipase immobilized on cellulose/lignin beads showed higher activity and stability than those of lipase immobilized on pure cellulose beads. The activity and stability of immobilized lipase increased with the increase in the lignin content in the cellulose/lignin beads. The activity, protein loading, and specific activity of lipase immobilized on the optimal cellulose/lignin beads were 2.6, 2.2, and 1.2 times higher than those of lipase immobilized on cellulose beads, respectively. The effect of lignin on the activity of lipase immobilized on cellulose/lignin beads was statistically well predicted. The residual activity of lipase immobilized on the optimal cellulose/lignin beads after incubation for 12\u00a0h at 40\u00a0\u00b0C was 3.2 and 1.9 times higher than that of free lipase and lipase immobilized on cellulose beads, respectively.

The immobilization of the enzyme on Octadecyl Sepabeads at pH 7 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C was the best choice to catalyze the esterification reaction.

     "abstract": "In addition to cellulose and hemicellulose, pectin is an important renewable resource for biorefinery. Endo- and exo-polygalacturonases are two essential enzymes required for complete deconstruction of pectin into simple and fermentable sugars. In biorefinery, thermophilic pectinases are more appealing than their mesophilic counterparts. Two pectinase genes encoding a putative exo-polygalacturonase (NfPG4) and a putative endopolygalacturonase (NfPG5), respectively, were thus cloned from a thermophilic filamentous fungus Neosartorya fischeri P1 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. NfPG4 and NfPG5 share 79% and 58% identity, respectively, with their closest characterized homologs from Aspergillus tubingensis and Achaetomium sp. Xz-8. They are both acidic and thermophilic, with maximum activities at pH 3.5 and 65\u00a0\u00b0C for NfPG4 and pH 4.5 and 70\u00a0\u00b0C for NfPG5, respectively. In comparison with other characterized thermophilic polygalacturonases, NfPG5 is the most thermophilic fungal endopolygalacturonase. Both enzymes have excellent stability at 55\u00a0\u00b0C and over a broad pH range (pH 3.0\u20138.0 for NfPG4 and pH 2.0\u201311.0 for NfPG5), and are strongly resistant to many metal ions and chemical reagents. NfPG5 has a typical endo-mode of action on polygalacturonic acid, releasing galacturonic acid, di-galacturonic acid, and tri-galacturonic acid. In contrast, NfPG4 only releases galacturonic acid as the end hydrolysis product, typified by exo-polygalacturonases. NfPG4 has a specific activity of 700.9\u00a0U/mg, higher than most characterized exo-polygalacturonases. NfPG5 is also a robust polygalacturonase with a specific activity of 3630.4\u00a0U/mg. These superior properties make the two polygalacturonases interesting candidates for industrial applications with a preference for thermophilic pectinases.",

It was found that the reaction rate of both transformations was increased more than twice by CDs. The observed increase of the enzymatic activity is connected with the beneficial influence of CDs on the active conformation of PheDH due to formation of inclusion complexes on the surface of the enzyme protein. Moreover, the formation of the Phe\u2013CD and PP\u2013CD complexes was also postulated and studied theoretically by semiempirical calculations. The specificity of PheDH for Phe\u2013CD increased over 6-fold in comparison with that for free Phe molecules. On the other hand, the specificity of PheDH for PP\u2013CD decreased three times as compared with that for uncomplexed PP molecules. These reversed specificities of PheDH for complexed and free substrate molecules seem to be related to different properties of the Phe\u2013CD and PP\u2013CD inclusion complexes.

Upon addition of either NADH or NADPH, the whole cells of E. brevis ZJUY-1401 showed enhanced catalytic activity. The activity and stereoselectivity of the biocatalyst toward acetophenone were significantly increased in the presence of 10% (v/v) ethanol as cosubstrate. Important properties concerning the application of E. brevis ZJUY-1401 include the excellent catalytic performance over a broad pH range from 6.0 to 9.5, temperature optimum of 35\u00a0\u00b0C, and noticeable tolerance against ethanol. Under the optimal conditions, E. brevis ZJUY-1401 was highly active for the reduction of acetophenone derivatives, giving corresponding alcohols in excellent enantiomeric purity (>99% ee). These results imply that E. brevis ZJUY-1401 is a promising biocatalyst for the preparation of anti-Prelog chiral alcohols.",

     "abstract": "Trypsin has been immobilized on divinyl sulfone (DVS) activated agarose at pH 5, 7 and 10. While at pH 5 and 7 immobilization was slow and presented a negative effect on enzyme activity, the immobilization at pH 10 produced a significant increment of activity (by a 24 fold factor). Using this preparation, the effect on enzyme activity/stability of different blocking reagents (used as an enzyme-support reaction end point) were evaluated, selecting ethylenediamine (EDA) because it produced an increase in enzyme activity (a 4 fold factor) and the best results in terms of stability. Next, the effect of alkaline incubation on enzyme activity/stability before the blocking step was analyzed. Activity decreased by 40% after 72\u00a0h (but it should be considered that previously it had increased by a 24 fold factor), but the stability significantly improved after this incubation. Thus, after immobilization at different pH values, the immobilized trypsin was submitted to 72\u00a0h of alkaline incubation and blocked with EDA. The most active and stable preparation was that immobilized at pH 10. This preparation was less stable than the glyoxyl preparation in thermal inactivations (by less than a twofold factor), but was more stable in organic solvent inactivation (also by less than a twofold factor). The number of groups involved in the enzyme support attachment was 6 Lys using glyoxyl and became a minimum of 13 (including Lys, Tyr and His) using the DVS-activated support (the precision of the method did not permit to analyze the implication of some of the 3 terminal amino groups). Thus, this DVS-agarose support seems to be a very promising support to permit a very intense enzyme-support multipoint covalent attachment.",

     "abstract": "This is the first study on the effect of ionic liquids (ILs) based on non-nutritive sweeteners on the catalytic efficiency and the structural and the thermal stability of lipases from Candida rugosa (CRL) and Rhizopus delemar (RhDL). Initially, we synthesized two series of ILs, namely 1-akyl-3-methylimidazolium saccharinates {[CnC1im][Sac]} and 1-akyl-3-methylimidazolium acesulfamates {[CnC1im][Ace]}, where the alkyl substituent was butyl, hexyl, octyl or decyl. The activities of the two enzymes were tested in two hydrolytic reactions using walnut oil and 4-nitrophenyl acetate as substrates. The activity of CRL toward walnut oil was strongly influenced by the chain-length of the N-alkyl substituents at the imidazolium cation of the compounds. The ILs with short alkyl substituents (butyl or hexyl) activated moderately (up to 30%) or had no effect on CRL activity, while those with medium chain-length substituents strongly inhibited CRL. In the case of CRL, we observed the same behavior pattern for the two tested series of ILs, while for RhDL the same tendency was displayed only for the series of saccharinates. The coating of RhDL with 0.1\u00a0M [C8C1im][Sac] or [C8C1im][Ace] resulted in up to 1.5-fold increase in the enzyme initial activity. In contrast, CRL was strongly inhibited by these two ILs. We found that the effect of [C8C1im][Ace] on enzyme activity adopted concentration- and time-dependent manner for the two lipases.We observed a moderate increase in hydrolytic activity (by 1.2-fold factor) and good storage stability of RhDL (more than 30 days at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) when small quantities of all ionic liquids (<0.04\u00a0M), were added to the enzyme solutions. At the same time, by adding of 0.02\u00a0M [C4C1im][Sac] or [C4C1im][Ace], CRL was also stabilized and its activity was preserved for more than 25 days at room temperature. For comparison, the activities of the stored at 25\u00a0\u00b0C non-treated with ILs soluble CRL and RhDL were reduced by half for 7 days and 5 days, respectively. In contrast, we observed rapid inactivation at higher temperatures for all ionic liquid-coated enzymes. For example, half-lives of 25\u00a0min and 57.3\u00a0min at 50\u00a0\u00b0C were estimated for the pre-treated with [C4C1im][Ace]-CRL and for the non-treated-CRL, respectively. In addition, applying Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, we monitored the changes in the secondary structure of the two enzymes in presence of the tested ILs which explained the altered stability and the activities of the two enzymes. Interestingly, coating with small amounts of ILs prevents aggregation of the two lipases even at high protein concentration.",

Furthermore, whole-cell biocatalyst reaction process with repeated cell recycling to eliminate product inhibition was conducted in 1-L bioreactor under the optimum reaction conditions for L-pipecolic acid production.

     "abstract": "Chloroperoxidase (CPO) from Caldariomyces fumago is a versatile enzyme because of its ability to catalyze different reactions, with high regio- and enantio-selectivities, and among them the styrene epoxidation is of especial industrial interest. However, the use of CPO at industrial scale has been limited mainly due to their low operational stability. In this work, two fundamental aspects are addressed: the selection of a suitable co-solvent to improve biocatalytic epoxidation reaction of hydrophobic substrates such as styrene and some of its derivatives, and CPO immobilization in mesoporous materials in order to increase the enzyme operational stability. Co-solvents tested were acetonitrile, 2-methyl-2-propanol and 2-methyl-2-butanol. In addition, CPO immobilization onto three mesoporous materials was assayed: two siliceous mesocellular foams (MCF and MSU-F) and titanium dioxide (TiO2, anatase). The CPO/MCF preparation showed 3-times higher catalytic activity for styrene epoxidation than the free enzyme. In addition, the total turnover numbers (TTN) were determined for styrene, 3-chlorostyrene and 3-nitrostyrene epoxidations, both with free and immobilized enzyme. The CPO immobilization in mesoporous materials together with use of co-solvent increased the operational stability of CPO in 51% in the case of styrene, 41% for 3-chlorostyrene and 246% for 3-nitrostyrene, when compared to the corresponding values obtained with the free enzyme. These results clearly indicated that CPO immobilization onto nanostructured materials and the use of co-solvent significantly enhances the enzymatic epoxidation reactions of styrene derivatives.",

     "abstract": "Proteases represent the commercially most relevant enzyme family with applications in the chemical, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry. For the personal care industry, both cold-active and thermo-active protease variants are of particular interest for detergent formulation. We have identified a gene sequence encoding a putative subtilisin-like serine protease in a gene library of the psychrophilic bacterium Shewanella arctica (DSM 16509, JCM 14208). The recombinant protein (67\u00a0kDa, 644 amino acids) product was flanked by 4.4\u00a0kDa (38 a.a.) signal sequence. Initial in-silico sequence analysis and protein modelling revealed the dominant alpha helical structural features embedding the catalytic residues Asp-180, His-213 and Ser-364, which form the canonical catalytic triad of subtilisin-like serine proteases. Further, in the N-terminal region a subtilisin-N domain was detected between residues Asp-55 and Thr-135. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that this enzyme can be classified as subtilisin-like serine protease with 73% amino acids identity to its closest characterized relative, the putative protease of Pseudoaltermonas sp. This is the first report of a detailed biochemical characterization of Shewanella spp. derived protease activity. The recombinant protein (28.18\u00a0mg/L), termed SaP, was purified to homogeneity from a crude E. coli lysate with an activity of 0.52\u00a0U/mg. Surprisingly, although derived from psychrophilic bacteria, SaP is active over a very broad temperature (T\u00a0=\u00a00\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C) and pH (pH 6\u201310) range, with optimal proteolytic activity at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 8.

Preparations obtained with 10\u00a0mg of protein per gram of support were compared with respect to the synthesis of ethyl-oleate in n-hexane, using an ethanol to oleic acid molar ratio of 3:1. LipC12 gave a better conversion of oleic acid when immobilized on Immobead 150 (95% in 4\u00a0h) than when immobilized on Accurel MP-1000 (80% in 6\u00a0h).

At a protein loading of 200\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121, the immobilized preparation (\u201cIbead-CELipC12\u201d) gave a conversion of oleic acid of 99% in 60\u00a0min, for reactions performed in n-hexane, again using an ethanol to oleic acid molar ratio of 3:1.

However, when the reaction was repeated with the addition of ethanol in six equal aliquots during the course of the reaction, a conversion of oleic acid of 85% in 48\u00a0h was achieved. These results demonstrate that LipC12 has good potential to be used in the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel. The results are particularly encouraging because it was possible to immobilize His-tagged LipC12 directly from the crude extract, thereby avoiding the need to purify the enzyme prior to immobilization.",

The microscale sample was subjected to microwaves\u2019 electric field (E-field) and magnetic field (H-field) radiation; good temperature control for samples at the \u03bcL scale was achieved using an apparatus that emitted microwaves at a precise frequency (5.800000\u00a0GHz). Temperature-dependent experiments with the Asp-N metallo-enzyme confirmed the activity of this enzyme to be greatest at 37\u00a0\u00b0C reached within 15\u00a0s on irradiation with the 5.8-GHz microwaves\u2019 H-field component with an input power of 1.7\u00a0W under air cooling conditions. Enzymatic activity decreased significantly above and below this temperature by a slight temperature change of 1\u00a0\u00b0C. Proteolysis yields of the peptide by the Asp-N enzyme at 30\u201342\u00a0\u00b0C under microwave E-field and H-field heating and under conventional heating revealed that enhancement of the proteolysis of the peptide at 37\u00a0\u00b0C by E-field irradiation (42.6%) was 1.5 times greater than by conventional heating (27.5%), whereas under microwave H-field irradiation (63.5%) it was 2.3 times greater than conventional heating. The relative dielectric loss factors (\u025br\u2033) of the sample solution (peptide\u00a0+\u00a0enzyme) were also determined: 22.19 (5.8\u00a0GHz) and 12.78 (2.45\u00a0GHz) at 22\u00a0\u00b0C, which decreased with increasing temperature (faster for the 5.8-GHz microwaves) so that the initial heating efficiency of 5.8-GHz microwaves was nearly twofold greater than for 2.45-GHz microwaves. Results indicated that in addition to a thermal factor, microwave non-thermal factors also had a significant influence as the microwaves considerably enhanced the proteolytic process relative to traditional heating.",

The influence of lipase, reaction medium, nucleophile, temperature and the structure of the acyl group on the reaction velocity, the stereopreference and the stereoselectivity of the deacylation was studied. In addition, the rate of the spontaneous intramolecular migration of different acyl groups was determined for the intermediate 2-monoesters. The acyl group migration may diminish the apparent stereoselectivity of the two-step process if fast migrating acyl groups are used. It was found that the migration rate of different acyl groups differs by up to two orders of magnitude, being faster for acetyl and isobutyryl and much slower for butyryl and benzoyl groups.The best results were obtained by the sequential methanolysis of bis-butyryl-1,2-alkanediols in an acetonitrile/methanol mixture catalyzed by Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) at 20\u00a0\u00b0C, affording (S)-1,2-alkanediols.

Purification from inclusion bodies was achieved by a six-step dialysis protocol enabling mild refolding of the urea-denaturated protein followed by affinity- and size-exclusion chromatography under native conditions. Pul13A is a type-I pullulanase, which is capable of hydrolysing \u03b1-1,6-glycosidic bonds in pullulan to produce maltotriose, while maltose and intermediate oligosaccharides are produced from soluble starch and amylopectin. The recombinant enzyme exhibited typical properties of cold-adapted proteins including low thermostability at elevated temperatures. It showed a temperature optimum at 35\u00a0\u00b0C, while at 10\u00a0\u00b0C residual activity (25%) remained. The optimal pH was in the range of 6.0\u20137.0, with Pul13A being stable at neutral and basic pH, but not in the acidic range. Catalytic activity was increased in the presence of divalent cations calcium and cobalt and both metal ions were also able to restore catalytic activity of EDTA-chelated enzyme samples. Pul13A represents the first type-I pullulanase from a psychrophile that has been produced in recombinant form. Moreover, its favourable enzymatic properties make this enzyme a potential candidate for industrial applications such as starch degradation for ethanol based biofuel production.",

P450cam catalyzes the hydroxylation of camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor. The variant P450cam (Y96F/V247L) was reported for the oxidation of monoterpene by protein engineering. In this work, we constructed an artificial self-sufficient P450-type monoterpene hydroxylase by connecting the P450SMO reductase domain and the P450cam (Y96F/V247L) domain together with a linker region (G4S)4. The resultant chimeric P450 enzyme could catalyze the hydroxylation of (\u2212)-limonene and \u03b1-pinene as well as camphor, which were all inactive for the natural fusion protein P450SMO. Co-expression of the fused P450 with a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) improved the (\u2212)-limonene conversion as sufficient NADPH was regenerated in the system with glucose as a cosubstrate. This work illustrated that P450SMO reductase might act as an electron donor partner of P450s and might be used for fusion with heterogeneous P450 domains to elucidate the catalytic function of other unknown P450s.",

     "abstract": "Enzymatic reduction of CO2 to formic acid promises the production of high-value chemicals from greenhouse gases in the way of high selectivity and low energy consumption. However, slow hydration process of CO2 in reaction solution leads to low production rate of formic acid. Carbonic anhydrase (CA), a vigorous biocatalyst for CO2 hydration, has attracted much attention for its potential applications in CO2 capture and sequestration in recent years, while its use in biosynthesis of chemicals and fuels based on CO2 has hardly been reported. Herein we report the feasibility of CA in facilitating biosynthesis of formic acid from CO2 with the catalysis of formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and various reaction conditions were optimized for the first time. With the addition of CA, the substrate of FDH might transform from CO2 to more soluble HCO3\u2212, together with the increase in the hydration rate of CO2, resulting in that the production rate of formic acid was increased by a factor of 4.2-fold. Due to the decrease in pH value induced by CA with the reaction proceeded, the ratio of two enzymes was important to coordinate the reaction rate and avoid the accumulation of hydrogen ions, at the same time, buffer system was critical to ensure the synergize effect of CA. It appeared to us that the introduction of CA represents a new bioprocessing strategy for efficient biotansformation of CO2 to formic acid and its further products.",

However, the acetaldehyde tolerance of DERASEP is still at low level, which limits its use in large-scale applications. Although the mechanism responsible for enzyme inactivation in the presence of solvents is unclear, earlier work indicated the positive correlation between the tolerance of an enzyme for organic solvents and the rigidity of its structure. The acetaldehyde tolerance of DERASEP was improved by site-directed mutagenesis on the basis of enhancing the rigidity of the protein structure. After calculating the virtual mutation energy (stability) of the enzyme and experimental verification, variant10 mutant DERASEP with three amino acid substitutions (T120C, G174I, and G213C) was harvested after three rounds of site-directed mutagenesis. It showed surprisingly high tolerance to acetaldehyde, with almost 70.5% residual catalytic activity after exposure to 300\u00a0mM acetaldehyde for 2\u00a0h, while the wild-type DERASEP retained only 11.3% activity under the same condition. Because the rigidity of the protein was increased after incorporating the mutations, the specific activity of the variant10 was only half that of DERASEP. Thus, the acetaldehyde tolerance of DERASEP was efficiently increased by enhancing the rigidity of the structure. These results suggested that the inactivation of DERA by exposure to acetaldehyde may result from protein structural damage.",

Genes encoding several thermophilic xylanases were cloned, including \u03b1-glucuronidase, endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase, xylan-1,4-\u03b2-xylosidase, and \u03b1-l-arabinofuranosidase. The enzymatic activities of the proteins were studied under a wide range of pH (4\u20138) and temperature (45\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C) conditions. Optimal pH and temperature values were determined as follows: \u03b1-glucuronidase, 50\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 7.5; endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase, 55\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 5.7; xylan-1,4-\u03b2-xylosidase, 65\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 5.0. Under optimal conditions, the enzymes showed the following activities: \u03b1-glucuronidase, 23.26\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0min\u22121\u00a0mg\u22121; endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase, 2.9\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0min\u22121\u00a0mg\u22121; and xylan-1,4-\u03b2-xylosidase, 58.03\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0min\u22121\u00a0mg\u22121, demonstrating that some of the enzymes are active in ionic liquid (IL).

The recombinant E. coli cells co-expressing the Segniliparus CAR and Nocardia PPTase genes catalyzed the reductions of vanillic acid (20a) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (25a) to give vanillyl alcohol (20c) and 3-hydroxytyrosol (25c) with high yield, respectively. The endogenous aldehyde reductases of E. coli should be responsible for the further reduction of the produced aldehydes.

The optimal temperature and pH for UEB-S lichenases activity were 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 6.0, respectively. More remarkably, the purified lichenase was stable over a broad range of temperature and pH. It retained more than 60% of its activity after incubation at 90\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Substrate specificity studies revealed that the enzyme is a true lichenase. A genomic library was screened. It allows the identification of a gene that encodes a putative lichenase showing 98% identity with the lichenase from Bacillus subtilis 168. Sequence comparison revealed that the two enzymes differed by two mutations at positions 69 and 83, where Val69 and Ser83 are replaced by Met and Ala amino acids, respectively. Therefore, a theoretical structural model was built using the lichenase from B. subtilis 168 Pdb code (3o5sA) structure as template. Comparison of the two 3D structures suggested that Val69 stabilizes a calcium-binding site and could be involved in the higher stability of the enzyme.",

The purified HHDHTm displays maximum enzymatic activity toward 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (DCP) at the more alkaline pH, 45\u00a0\u00b0C. HHDHTm was stable up to 55\u00a0\u00b0C and approximately 60% of residual activity retained at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. HHDHTm shows higher activities toward halohydrins with modest enantioselectivities compared with other reported HHDHs. Interesting, (S)-epichlorohydrin (ECH) was enantioselectively biotransformed from the prochiral 1,3-DCP with about 75% yield. Moreover, 100\u00a0g/L ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate (CHBE) can be converted to ethyl (R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyrate (HN) with >99% ee and 89% isolated recovery by the recombinant HHDHTm. Therefore, HHDHTm is a promising biocatalyst for (S)-ECH and (R)-HN production.",

In order to reduce the formation of 3-aminopropanamide, aspartate ammonia-lyase and fumaric acid were added into the reaction system to consume the byproduct ammonia. As expected, the reaction was shifted toward the formation of \u03b2-alanine, resulting in the decrease of 3-aminopropanamide from 33% to 3%.

In this study, multimeric enzymes pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNP) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), from Thermus thermophilus and Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius, respectively, were successfully immobilized on the magnetic beads with cross-linked polyethyleneimine and epoxide functional groups, resulting in high enzyme loading (up to 0.4 and 1.3\u00a0g per g dry beads), high enzyme activity maintenance (41% and 83% under the highest enzyme loading), and improved enzyme stability.

     "abstract": "Multipoint covalent attachment of Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) on epoxy-functionalized silica and silica nanoparticles (MCM-41 and SBA-15) is reported. Multipoint immobilization of enzymes on these supports usually performs by the reaction between several epoxy groups of the support and several Lys residues on the external surface of the enzyme molecules at pH 10. However, this standard immobilization procedure is unsuitable for ROL due to the low stability of ROL at pH 10. Introducing new amino groups with lower pKb to the surface of ROL by using chemical amination strategy permits immobilization of the enzyme at lower pH values. Immobilization/stabilization of aminated ROL was performed in two steps. First the enzyme is covalently immobilized at pH 7.0 and then the already immobilized enzyme is further incubated at pH 9.2 to promote the formation of further covalent linkages between the immobilized ROL and the support. The results showed higher thermal and co-solvent stability for immobilized derivatives of aminated ROL compared to the results obtained for the derivatives of not-aminated ROL and free ROL. Influence of the immobilization procedure on selectivity of the immobilized preparations was studied in selective hydrolysis of fish oil at three different conditions. The selectivity and reusability of ROL was greatly improved after immobilization.

Analysis of the enzyme kinetics indicated that the catalytic constant (kcat) and specific constant (kcat/KM) increased in the presence of amine compounds depending on both the multivalency and hydrophobicity of the amine compounds, whereas the Michaelis constant (KM) remained constant. Molecular dynamics simulation suggested that the enhancement of enzyme activity of ChT was induced by weak interactions between amine compounds and ChT.

X6-CLEAs, X7-CLEAs, L1-CLEAs and L7-CLEAs were prepared after elaborative optimization of the precipitating agent and glutaraldehyde concentration. The highest activity after precipitation was observed with acetone but following cross-linking with glutaraldehyde less than 60% activity was retained, while more than 60% activity was retained after precipitation with ammonium sulphate and cross-linking with glutaraldehyde.

We recently reported the racemization of enantiopure phenyl-ring-containing alcohols using W110A Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (W110A TeSADH), which relies on selectivity mistakes. Trp-110 lines the large pocket of the active site of TeSADH, which allows W110A TeSADH mutant to accommodate phenyl-ring-containing substrates in Prelog mode, albeit with selectivity mistakes. Here, we report the racemization of enantiopure phenyl-ring-containing alcohols using several Trp-110 mutants of TeSADH in the presence of the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide\u2013adenine dinucleotide. We observed a noticeable enhancement in racemization efficiency when W110G TeSADH was used compared with W110Q, W110M, W110L, W110I, and W110V. This observation was anticipated because the W110G mutation is expected to open the large pocket of the active site to a greater extent compared to other mutants of TeSADH at W110. Both enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol and 4-phenyl-2-butanol were fully racemized by W110G TeSADH. We also constructed a triple mutant of TeSADH, W110A/I86A/C295A, by site-directed mutagenesis with the aim of opening the two pockets of the active site of TeSADH. The W110A/I86A/C295A mutant was employed to racemize enantiopure phenyl-ring-containing alcohols. The current study demonstrates that W110G and W110A/I86A/C295A TeSADH are more efficient catalysts for the racemization of enantiopure secondary alcohols than the previously reported mutant W110A TeSADH [6].",

     "abstract": "One-pot multistep stereoselective cascade reactions were implemented for the straightforward synthesis of various nitrocyclitols. Two kinases, an aldolase and a phosphatase were involved in this process, together with a spontaneous intramolecular Henry reaction to provide the nitrocyclitol moiety. The CC bond formation catalysed by the aldolase and the nitroaldol reactions were key steps to build the carbocycle stereoselectively. The aldolase acceptor substrates were all 4-nitrobutanal structurally based, either hydroxylated or unsubstituted at the C2 and/or C3 positions. l-Fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (FucA) catalysed the formation of the expected (R,R)- or d-erythro aldol, except in the case of 4-nitrobutanal, from which the epimeric (R,S)- or l-threo aldol was also formed. l-Rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase consistently formed the expected (R,S)- or l-threo aldol together with a minor amount of (R,R)- or d-erythro aldol. The intramolecular Henry reaction was also found to be stereoselective, occurring spontaneously once the aldol was formed due to the presence of both ketone and a terminally positioned nitro group. The combination of this set of reactions successfully furnished 11 nitrocyclitols which have not been described previously in the literature.",

     "abstract": "Since the preparation of nucleoside 5\u2032-diphosphates by classical methodologies is complex, multistep enzymatic systems were explored to synthesize pyrimidine nucleoside 5\u2032-diphosphates starting from readily available reagents. Different strategies were combined to prepare uridine- and thymidine 5\u2032-diphosphates as ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside models, respectively. For uridine 5\u2032-diphosphate synthesis, conversions between 38 and 66% were achieved, using a simple methodology that involves commercial yeast extract as biocatalyst and biocatalytically in situ prepared uridine 5\u2032-monophosphate. Corynebacterium ammoniagenes ATCC 19350 was used for the first time as biocatalyst to synthesize uridine 5\u2032-monophosphate from uracil and orotic acid while Raoultella planticola was the selected biocatalyst for uridine 5\u2032-monophosphate synthesis from uridine. The overall performances of all the tested approaches were similar but the use of uracil leads to a more suitable and cheaper process. Alternatively, for thymidine 5\u2032-diphosphate synthesis two consecutive one pot multistep enzyme systems were assayed. In the first biotransformation, 2\u2032-deoxyribose 5-phosphate was formed from glucose by Erwinia carotovora whole cells followed by the action of phosphopentomutase and thymidine phosphorylase affording thymidine in 85% conversion relative to 2\u2032-deoxyribose 5-phosphate. Finally, in the second one pot reaction, the nucleoside was converted to thymidine 5\u2032-diphosphate by the combined action of Escherichia coli BL21 pET22b-phoRp and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

     "abstract": "Metalloproteases represent the largest fraction of the global enzyme market. For biotechnological purposes the accumulation of product (i.e. productivity) provides the best measure of assessing enzyme performance because it takes into account the interplay between activity, stability, activation and inhibition. Studies assessing the productivity of alkaline metalloproteases and chemicals that improve their productivity have not previously been reported. In this study we report the specificity, productivity, kinetic and thermodynamic properties of an extracellular protease, purified from a new strain of Pseudomonas sp. isolated from refrigerated milk. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the enzyme is a serralysin-type alkaline metalloprotease, with broad cleavage-site specificity. By studying the effects of Ca2+ ion removal (using a chelator) and Ca2+ ion addition, conditions were identified that led to an increase in productivity by 300% (6.3 vs 1.9\u00a0mg\u00a0azopeptide\u00a0\u03bcg\u22121 enzyme at 40\u00a0\u00b0C). The basis for the enhanced productivity was linked to elevated melting temperatures of secondary (Tm 47 vs 38\u00a0\u00b0C) and tertiary structure (Tm 50 vs 44\u00a0\u00b0C), increased half-life of inactivation (t1/2 30 vs 4.9\u00a0min), increased optimum temperature (44 vs 36\u00a0\u00b0C), and changes in both catalytic activity (kcat 3.3 vs 2.2\u00a0min\u22121) and substrate affinity (Km 3.9 vs 2.5\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121). Thermodynamic data were indicative of Ca2+-binding causing the transition-state to be more ordered (less entropy) relative to the folded-state, thereby resisting a transition to an unfolded state. The specificity, kinetics and response to calcium of this AMP illustrate its potential usefulness for industrial applications, and the research highlights the broader potential for using calcium to enhance the productivity of proteases.",

Genetic engineering facilitates the artificial fusion of genes that encode functional proteins into a single open reading frame.

The metagenome of cow rumen bacteria was the source of a gene that encodes an extracellular \u03b2-glucanase for cloning and expression in Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1. The cellulase (cel9E) gene of un-culturable rumen bacteria existed in tandem with the xylanase (xyn10A) gene.

The results demonstrated an increase up to 31\u00a0U/mg in the activity of the enzyme after folding as revealed by circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, differential scanning calorimetry, and free thiol analysis. Collectively, these techniques revealed a larger number of covalent and non-covalent bonds within the protein seen as an increase in the chemical and thermal stability, while exhibited a lower level of non-bonded cysteines after the protein was folded. Mass spectrometry analysis showed the maintenance of the distribution of the enzyme isoforms related to N-terminal histidine residues after folding, which confirmed that the enzymatic activity of rLAP depends on its three-dimensional structure rather than N-terminal self-processing activity.

This objective can be realized by an amalgamation of magnetic nanobiotechnology and enzyme engineering. The present work explores the ramifications of this concept through the insolubilization of inulinase on to magnetite nanoparticles entrapped in chitosan (cMNPs). Statistical methods were used to identify the optimum concentration of EDAC (N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2032-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride), cMNPs, and cross-linking time which play a pivotal role in deciding the overall efficiency of the biocatalyst. The optimum concentrations for preparation of the magnetic biocatalyst were found to be 15.29\u00a0mg and 23.76\u00a0mg for EDAC and cMNPs respectively, for which the maximum activity recovery obtained, was 81.40% with an optimum cross linking time of 1.73\u00a0h. The optimum pH and temperature for soluble inulinase (SI) was found to be 6.0 and 70\u00a0\u00b0C whereas that of magnetically insolubilized inulinase (MII) shifted to 4.6 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. The insolubilized inulinase could be recycled for up to 15 cycles with substantial activity at least for a year at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. This feature coupled with ease separation of biocatalyst and a fivefold increase in the t1/2 value at temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C are evidence of enhanced thermal and operational stability inherited by the enzyme after insolubilization, indicating a high stability in practical operation.",

AAL was not detected in Corynebacterium glutamicum Lys1 but increased in aspB-deleted strain. Inversely, AAT exhibited high activity in Lys1, but it was not detected in aspB-deleted strains. Moreover, the deletion of aspB was bad for cell growth and metabolites production. The expression of Escherichia coli aspA in aspB-deleted strain not only restored cell growth and l-lysine production, but also accumulated some metabolites. However, the over-expression of aspB or aspA in aspB-natural strain did not affect cell growth and metabolites production except l-aspartate production. Although E. coli AAL could used to restore cell growth and metabolites accumulation in aspB-deleted strain, the effect on l-lysine production was significantly worse than that of AAT. Results indicates that native AAT is both necessary and sufficient for cell growth and l-lysine production, and deepens our understanding of the role of native aspB and E. coli aspA on cell growth and metabolites productions.",

The scanning electron microscope images indicate that Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs have a spherical and uniform size distribution, and the high saturation magnetization (14.68\u00a0emu\u00a0g\u22121) makes it easily to be separated from the reaction system under an extra magnetic field. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis reveal that polydopamine (PDA) has been successfully coated on Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs surface. During in situ polymerization of DA, laccase is also firmly immobilized on Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs, and the total activity recovery can reach to 43.28%. However, the laccase immobilized by glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking method only keeps 3.33% of the total activity recovery under the optimized condition. Compared with free laccase and laccase immobilized by GA, the laccase immobilized by DA exhibits superior resistance to a broader pH value and obviously enhanced stability. After 10 times reusing cycles, the activity of laccase immobilized by DA still retains 65% of its initial activity, whereas the laccase immobilized by GA has 35% of its original activity. After 70 days of storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the laccase immobilized by DA keeps about 80% of its initial activity, but the free laccase and the laccase immobilized by GA only remained 7.8% and 37%, respectively.

The state of the art production is the Clostridia based anaerobic acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE) fermentation process. However, the classical ABE fermentation is capped at 2% (v/v) butanol yield, due to end-product toxicity effects. By contrast, cell-free bio-butanol production systems based on designed enzyme cascades hold the promise of higher butanol yields and simplified end-product recovery. Crotonases catalyze the reversible hydration of crotonyl-CoA and are key enzymes in butanol biosynthesis.

     "abstract": "The homodimeric Candida parapsilosis carbonyl reductase 2 (CPCR2) is an industrially attractive biocatalyst due to its broad substrate range and high stereoselectivity. In addition, CPCR2 is reasonably stable in monophasic organic solvents (e.g. alcohols) but apparently instable in biphasic organic systems. Hence, we conducted first a thorough quantitative inactivation study of CPCR2, using both wild-type and stability improved variants, in an attempt to identify critical factors influencing the enzyme stability. Possible inactivation phenomena including oxidation, shear forces, dissociation and adsorption at interfaces were assessed on a microliter scale using quantitative kinetic assays. Our results demonstrate that interface interactions and dimer dissociation are the main reasons for inactivation of CPCR2. Shear forces seems to enhance these inactivation processes whereas oxidation plays no role in CPCR2 inactivation. Secondly, an attempt was made to find suitable stabilization strategies to utilize CPCR2 in various reaction systems. To minimize the inactivation, bovine serum albumin was used as traditional blocking and crowding agent. The residual activity of the wild-type was successfully increased up to 2.5-fold by addition of 1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u22121 bovine serum albumin. To avoid dimer dissociation the cofactor concentration was successively increased. The residual activity was successfully enhanced up to 5-fold, 3-fold and 1.5-fold for the wild-type, single and double mutant, respectively. Further, recently gained data from the enzyme crystal structure were used to interpret the effects of stabilization. We propose conformational change of a flexible region in CPCR2 upon binding of the cofactor leading to internal stabilization of the enzyme. In conclusion, we propose the addition of bovine serum albumin and the cofactor NADH as a suitable stabilization strategy to utilize CPCR2 in various reaction systems.",

This strategy allowed to obtain aza-Michael adducts from benzylamine and different acrylates with high selectivity. In almost all reactions carried out in n-hexane, a non-polar solvent, aminolysis was avoided while the corresponding Michael adducts were exclusively synthesized in 53\u201378% yields.

Fluoride competitive binding studies revealed that L29E Mb has an axial water molecule readily replaced by fluoride anion, whereas L29H Mb has a much more stable axial water molecule. pH titration studies showed that L29E Mb exhibits a lower pKa and L29H Mb exhibits a higher pKa of the heme coordinated water molecule compared to that of Mb, rationalizing the relative hydrolysis activities. Moreover, pH-jump induced unfolding studies suggested that the heme distal hydrogen-bonding network, especially in L29H Mb, plays a key role in stabilization of the protein.

     "abstract": "Methyl caffeate is a natural ingredient with several biological activities, but its preparation is generally limited to chemical synthesis. To set up a simple, high-yield and low-cost synthesis process for obtaining methyl caffeate, a novel synthesis method using the lipase-catalyzed esterification of methanol and caffeic acid in an ionic liquid under ultrasound irradiation was established. A maximum yield of 99.79% was obtained using ultrasound irradiation with an ultrasound frequency of 25\u00a0kHz and ultrasound power of 150\u00a0W under the following optimal conditions: Novozym 435 as a biocatalyst, [Bmim][Tf2N] as the reaction medium, lipase concentration of 60\u00a0g/L, reaction temperature of 75\u00a0\u00b0C, and reaction time of 9\u00a0h. Using the optimal conditions under ultrasound irradiation, the reaction time was reduced 0.75-fold, and the apparent kinetic parameter (Vm/Km) was increased 2-fold. The lipase could be reused 11 times without significant loss of activity. The results suggest that ultrasound irradiation can accelerate lipase-catalyzed synthesis of methyl caffeate in an ionic liquid.",

Through subsequent construction of a subclone library, 3 chitosanase positive clones were selected. The gene csnA, which was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami, consisted of 834 base pairs encoding 277 amino acid residues. The corresponding recombinant chitosanase CsnA was overexpressed and showed a molecular mass of 31\u00a0kDa. The specific activity of CsnA reached 2373\u00a0U/mg toward chitosan, with the optimal pH and temperature of 6.0 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. CsnA performed stable activity at a wide pH range from 4.5 to 6.5 and was thermostable at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 55\u00a0\u00b0C. The enzyme is significantly inhibited by various heavy metal ions and SDS, while enhanced by Mn2+, Sr2+, Tweens and Tritons.

The specificity of conjugation was verified by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and the secondary structures of the conjugates were verified by circular dichroism. PEGylated enzymes retained their activity, which was higher in low molecular mass PEG conjugates. Importantly, both pH and thermal stability of enzymes were enhanced by PEGylation, especially at basic pH and above room temperature. Moreover, conjugates with the site of polymer coupling near the catalytic centre were more stable.

Here, quantum-mechanical (QM)/molecular-mechanical (MM) calculations for the l-DEX from Pseudomonas sp. YL (l-DEX YL) 2-CPA complex were performed to elucidate the structure of transition state and the energy profile in this enzymatic reaction. QM/MM simulations using the ONIOM (PM3:Amber) method revealed that the activation energy of dehalogenation reaction was around 9.0\u00a0kcal/mol and that one of the most important residues in the ester intermediate formation step was Arg41, which was found to decrease the activation energy by about 40\u00a0kcal/mol compared to the case of its absence. On the other hand, this stabilization effect by Arg41 was significantly counterbalanced by the presence of Asn177. Simulations of enzymes mutated at Arg41 indicated that mutants possessing a positive charge near the Arg41 position would allow the dehalogenation reaction as well. Specifically, it was suggested by our simulations that homolysine (homK) mutant of Arg41, which contains one more methylene group in the side chain compared to lysine, could be active as well as the wild-type enzyme. The distance from the chloride ion to the position of the positive charge of the acceptor seems to dictate the activation energy.",

Using different mixtures of \u03b1Glc 1-P and Glc 6-P (e.g. 180\u00a0mM each) as the substrate, Zbasic2_HAD4 could be used to selectively convert the \u03b1Glc 1-P present, leaving back all of the Glc 6-P for recovery. Zbasic2_HAD4 was immobilized conveniently using direct loading of E. coli cell extract on sulfonic acid group-containing porous carriers, yielding a recyclable heterogeneous biocatalyst that was nearly as effective as the soluble enzyme, probably because protein attachment to the anionic surface occurred in a preferred orientation via the cationic Zbasic2 module. Selective removal of \u03b1Glc 1-P from sugar phosphate preparations could be an interesting application of Zbasic2_HAD4 for which readily available broad-spectrum phosphatases are unsuitable.",

These carriers were different from traditional solid supports, because they were free-standing and no aggregation in solution. Lipases were covalently bonded to these Fe3O4 nanoparticles through 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS) activated coupling to synthesize magnetically responsive lipases (MRLs). The analyses of transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed no significant change on the size and shape of Fe3O4 nanoparticles after being conjugated with lipases. The conjugation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and lipases was confirmed by electrophoresis and zeta potential analyses. Furthermore, the factors that affected the enzyme activity and specific activity of the MRLs were discussed. The optimized conjugation conditions were found to be that the dosages of the lipase solution and the EDC solution were 200\u00a0\u03bcL and 10\u00a0\u03bcL for 1\u00a0mL Fe3O4 respectively, the molar ratio of EDC and Sulfo-NHS was 1:2.5, and the conjugation time was 2\u00a0h.

We developed a direct method to quantify residue-adsorbed cellulase by elemental analysis without use of calorimetric methods such as the Bradford, BCA, or Lowry assays. First, initial cellulase loading was estimated from the absorbance at 280\u00a0nm using the weight adsorption coefficient of cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI), predicted using the amino acid sequence. Secondly, small amounts of nitrogen derived from adsorbed cellulase were detected using an elemental analyzer by analyzing various large quantities of residue. The nitrogen content of the Trichoderma reesei cellulolytic enzymes was calculated to be 16.5\u201317.3% based on the amino acid sequences, and the quantity of residue-adsorbed cellulase was calculated from the nitrogen content of the residue, using the nitrogen content of CBHI (16.5%).

The development of fast, simple and efficient immobilization strategies is becoming of great importance in specific Biological Micro-Electromechanical Systems (BioMEMS) manufacturing. Thus, the current work focuses on an original methodology and mild procedure for \u03b2-galactosidase immobilization. Using as support either silicon or a thin film obtained from polymerization of 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (ppTMDSO) deposited by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition in afterglow mode, the strategy developed here consisted in adsorption of \u03b2-galactosidase followed by its overcoating by the same siloxane plasma polymer. After sample washing, the enzymes were characterized to be efficiently entrapped within the porous polymer matrix while allowing the penetration and hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate ortho-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (o-NPG) with stability over at least 8 assays. The entrapment procedure allowed obtaining bio-functionnal coatings where \u03b2-galactosidase was expected to be included in the plasma-polymerized films while preserving its native structure and its activity. This latter was modulated by mass transfer limitations of the substrate according to the thickness of the ppTMDSO coatings.

The enzyme can be purified, immobilized, hyperactivated and stabilized, though its enantioselectivity could still be improved. A moderately hydrophobic support (e.g., phenyl-Toyopearl) allows the almost-quantitative immobilization of the enzyme via selective hydrophobic adsorption, while any contaminant proteins are not adsorbed. A further desorption of the adsorbed enzyme with surfactants (e.g., 0.5% sucrose laurate) allows the complete purification of the enzyme in only one step, with a 90% purification yield and an 8-fold purification factor. By using a more hydrophobic support, the ROL can be immobilized and hyperactivated. The enzyme is completely adsorbed on octyl-Sepharose and C18-Sepabeads. The pure enzyme (when adsorbed on these supports) becomes hyperactivated to approximately 250% of the activity of the soluble enzyme. In this study, two protocols for the covalent immobilization of ROL were developed: a one-point immobilization on CNBr-activated Sepharose and a multipoint covalent immobilization on highly activated glyoxyl-agarose supports. The multipoint attached enzyme decreased in activity to 50% of the activity of the soluble enzyme, but the derivatives were 300-fold more stable than the soluble enzyme. The hydrolysis of racemic 2-O-butyryl-2-phenylacetic acid was modulated by the different immobilized derivatives. In fact, the most active and selective preparation was demonstrated to be the C18-SB-ROL derivative (0.05\u00a0UI/mg and E\u00a0=\u00a022) when compared with the CNBr-ROL enzyme preparation (0.0073\u00a0UI/mg and E\u00a0=\u00a03.5).",

However, when the metabolism of Escherichia coli was re-engineered in the present study to express both aforementioned plant enzymes, it was observed that taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase acts on 4 substrates and forms 12 products, of which taxadien-5\u03b1-ol is only a minor constituent.

We describe the influence of four non-ionic surfactants (Tween 20, Triton X 114, Triton X 100, and Eumulgin ES) on the activity of the immobilized \u03b1-chymotrypsin and the optimization of the AMTPS composition via a Design of Experiments approach. Additionally, we demonstrate the reuse of the immobilisates for hemoglobin digestion over eleven cycles in an Eumulgin ES AMTPS. Our findings show that continuous enzymatic conversion processes can be implemented effectively with the help of carrier bound enzymes in surfactant systems.",

     "abstract": "Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reversible conversion of l-serine and tetrahydropteroylglutamate to glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroylglutamate. This enzyme represents a good model for analysing the intricate relationship between activity and stability, since it is ubiquitous in nature and well characterized from different organisms. Besides its physiological role, SHMT catalyses the reversible cleavage of several \u03b2-hydroxy amino acids varying in substituent and stereochemistry at C\u03b2 and, for this reason, it represents a good tool for biotechnological applications. SHMT from the psychrophilic bacterium Psychromonas ingrahamii (piSHMT) displays the interesting feature of having high specific activity in the cleavage of \u03b2-hydroxy amino acids at all temperatures. In the present study, we compare the temperature dependence of psychrophilic piSHMT and mesophilic Escherichia coli SHMT (ecSHMT) in catalysing the physiological hydroxymethyltransferase reaction. We also investigate the structural stability of both enzymes by performing equilibrium unfolding experiments. Unexpectedly, our results show that piSHMT is a less efficient catalyst than ecSHMT in the hydroxymethyltransferase activity at all temperatures. Moreover, the two enzymes have comparable structural stability, with piSHMT showing even higher resistance to chemical denaturation by urea and to inactivation by formaldehyde. This unusual structural stability of piSHMT and its high efficiency at low temperatures as catalyst of \u03b2-hydroxy amino acids cleavage make this enzyme an attractive tool for industrial applications.",

Different reaction condition factors, including acyl agent, solvent, reaction temperature, and the concentration of Et3N, were optimized in order to establish the optimal reaction conditions for the enzymatic kinetic resolution of secondary amines. It was demonstrated that acyl agent, the concentration of Et3N or the type of solvent have a greater influence on the selectivity and rate of the asymmetric acylation reaction in the process of the enzymatic resolution, respectively. The target product amine was obtained in good conversion (49%) and an excellent degree of enantiomeric purity (>99%) when Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) and phenyl allyl carbonates were combined to use in the tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) medium.

Recent progresses in CA research suggest that this biocatalyst can be used as an alternative or an additive for chemical CO2 capture, which is considered an essential green route for the reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, the facilities in which CA will most likely be used usually operate under high temperature conditions, requiring a highly thermostable CA. Here, we attempted to find and characterize \u03b1-CAs originated from Persephonella marina and Thermovibrio ammonificans, thermophilic Gram-negative bacteria in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The recombinant \u03b1-CAs expressed in Escherichia coli showed catalytic efficiencies better than the previously characterized thermophilic \u03b2- and \u03b3-CAs from archaea, and their activities were significantly increased at higher temperatures. Remarkably, these enzymes exhibited outstanding thermostability (stable up to at least 80\u00a0\u00b0C). Through long-term stability tests at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 60\u00a0\u00b0C, we discovered that the novel \u03b1-CA of T. ammonificans might be the most thermostable CA ever characterized. Also, the recombinant CAs successfully accelerated CO2 sequestration in CaCO3, more efficiently than mesophilic bovine CA under high temperature condition. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the \u03b1-CAs of thermophilic bacteria from deep-sea hydrothermal vents are promising biocatalysts for practical industrial CO2 capture in terms of both activity and stability.",

The polar solvent molecule approaches the catalytic triad of YLLIP2 more easily and has a stronger interaction with His289 than the non-polar solvent molecule. The interaction between His289 and Asp230 was affected by the higher temperature (333\u00a0K) whereas the interaction between His289 and Ser162 was affected by the polar solvent molecule (acetone and ethanol).",

     "abstract": "The stereo-recognition of chiral primary alcohols by lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia was found to deviate from earlier observations. Enantioselectivity toward 14 pairs of chiral primary alcohol esters by this lipase was dependent on the existence of an Onon-\u03b1 (oxygen at non-\u03b1-position of the acyloxy group) in the alcohol moiety, and decreased as the size of the acyl moiety increased. Chemical modification on the lipase and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that Tyr29 located within the catalytic cavity forms a hydrogen bond with the Onon-\u03b1 of the preferred enantiomer of the primary alcohol ester. However, a larger acyl moiety suffered stronger hindrance from the catalytic cavity wall of the lipase, pushing the Onon-\u03b1 away from Tyr29, and thus weakening the stereo-recognition.",

     "abstract": "Ceramides are spingolipid compounds that are very attractive as active components in both the pharmaceutical and the cosmetic industries. In this study, the synthesis of ceramide analogs, the so-called pseudo-ceramides, was carried out using for the first time a two-step continuous enzymatic process with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (Novozym\u00ae 435) in a packed-bed bioreactor. The first step involved the selective N-acylation of 3-amino-1,2-propanediol using stearic acid as the first acyl donor (i). This was followed by the selective O-acylation of the N-stearyl 3-amino-1,2-propanediol synthesized in the first step, with myristic acid as the second acyl donor, to produce a N,O-diacyl 3-amino-1,2-propanediol-type pseudo-ceramide, namely 1-O-myristyl,3-N-stearyl 3-amino-1,2-propanediol (ii). The process was first optimized by evaluating the influences of three factors: feed flow rate, quantity of biocatalyst and substrate concentration. Under optimal conditions an amide synthesis yield of 92% and a satisfying production rate of almost 3.15\u00a0mmol\u00a0h\u22121\u00a0gbiocatalyst\u22121 (1128\u00a0mg\u00a0h\u22121\u00a0gbiocatalyst\u22121) were obtained. The second step, N-acyl 3-amino-1,2-propanediol O-acylation, was similarly optimized and in addition the effect of the substrate molar ratio was studied. Thus, an optimal pseudo-ceramide synthesis yield of 54% and a production rate of 0.46\u00a0mmol\u00a0h\u22121\u00a0gbiocatalyst\u22121 (261\u00a0mg\u00a0h\u22121\u00a0gbiocatalyst\u22121) were reached at a 1:3 ratio of amide to fatty acid. In addition, it was demonstrated that this two-step process has great potential for the production of N,O-diacyl 3-amino-1,2-propanediol-type pseudo-ceramides on an industrial scale. It was shown in particular that Novozym\u00ae 435 could be used for more than 3 weeks without a drop in the yield during the first step of 3-amino-1,2-propanediol N-acylation, proving that this biocatalyst is very stable under these operational conditions. This factor would greatly reduce the need for biocatalyst replacement and significantly lower the associated cost.",

In the present work, an isolated and identified high acetoin (AC)-yielding (41.63\u00a0g/L) bacteria strain belonging to Bacillus subtilis but without 2,3-butanediol (BD) byproduct during its fermentation was selected. To understand the characteristics of BDH activity from this high AC-yielding strain, we cloned, purified and compared the BDH from Enterobacter aerogenes (CICC10293) (E. a-BDH) with the BDH from this high AC-yielding strain B. subtilis. Sequence alignments indicate a non-conservative amino acid substitution from Asp to Gly at site 194 on the B. s-BDH compared to that of E. a-BDH.

Moreover, Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements detected the substrate binding for the D194G B. s-BDH but no reaction was detected. Circular dicroism (CD) spectroscopy characterization revealed an identical secondary structure of E. a-BDH and D194G B. s-BDH. Remarkably, D194G B. s-BDH is highly susceptible to protease digestion, suggesting that the aspartic acid to glycine substitution might cause the proteolytic susceptibility of D194G B. s-BDH. Furthermore, by homology modeling with meso-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. p-BDH) as a template, Gly194 seems to lose the hydrogen bond interactions with the surrounding residues (Gly206, Gly207 and Thr209), resulting in a putative conformational changes of D194G B. s-BDH which might be responsible for the loss of activity.",

A comparison of the structures of NADPH-dependent FMO from Methylophaga aminisulfidivorans (mFMO) and SMFMO from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which is able to use both NADPH and NADH, suggested that the promiscuity of the latter enzyme may be due in part to the substitution of an Arg\u2013Thr couple in the NADPH phosphate recognition site in mFMO, for a Gln\u2013His couple in SMFMO (Jensen et al., 2012, Chembiochem, 13, 872\u2013878). Natural variation within the phosphate binding region, and its influence on nicotinamide cofactor promiscuity, was explored through the cloning, expression, characterisation and structural studies of FMOs from Cellvibrio sp.

It was observed that simultaneous addition of both calcium and sodium (1200\u00a0ppm of calcium and 400\u00a0ppm of sodium ions, in a ratio of 3:1) significantly improved the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), of CLEAs\u2013BSA\u2013CN from 3.91\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 to 4.57\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 (1.2-folds) compared with free enzyme. Although immobilization did not significantly affect Vmax (5.35\u20135.25), substrate affinity of the enzyme increased (1.34\u20131.12) after addition of mixed ions to the prepared CLEAs. Moreover, compared with free \u03b1-amylase, enzyme half-life (t1/2) of CLEAs\u2013BSA\u2013CN increased from 43.31 to 115\u00a0min (about 3-folds) at 110\u00a0\u00b0C.

With the aim to better understand the enantioselectivity of this reaction, we have performed a molecular dynamics (MD) study of the enzyme substrate complexes. Reactive enzyme substrate complexes were identified for both enantiomers of propranolol, which differ in their temporal stability and in their ability to reach the corresponding transition states (TS). Reactive complexes of R-propranolol present a better ability to be transformed by CalB than those of S-propranolol. This allows us to explain the enantioselectivity. Analysis of the enzyme\u2013substrate interactions suggests that the CH-\u03c0 interactions between the naphthyl rings of propranolol and the residues of the CalB binding pocket may play an important role in stabilizing the transition states involved in the transformation of the R-propranolol. The residues Ile189, Ala282 and Leu278 were identified as key residues for the enantioselectivity of CalB.",

Laccases were purified by ultrafiltration, ion exchange (IEX) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography achieving specific activities close to 285\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u22121. The molecular weights of LacI and LacII, determined by SDS-electrophoresis, were 68 and 66\u00a0kDa, respectively. Both laccases showed high amino acid sequence similarity (91%) between them and high thermostability, at 50 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C (half-lives of 277.7 and 18\u00a0h for LacI, 35.8 and 2.25\u00a0h for LacII). The isoforms oxidized common laccase substrates such as 2,2\u2032-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate (ABTS), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) and guaiacol at acidic pH conditions. ABTS was the most efficient substrate, showing high specificity constants of 74,816 and 36,746\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 for Lac I and LacII, and Michaelis constants (Km) of 6.9 and 12.2\u00a0\u03bcM respectively at pH 3.

The high thermostability, unique Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetic parameters, and organic solvent tolerance demonstrated for the isoforms produced by P. sanguineus CS43 render them promising candidates for industrial applications.

The immobilized on nanoZrO2-A lipase (nanoZrO2-A-CRL) exhibited enhanced thermal and solvent stability in comparison to the native enzyme. NanoZrO2-A-CRL has a half-life at 55\u00a0\u00b0C of 73\u00a0min, while for the native enzyme it was only 5.3\u00a0min. The immobilized enzyme preserved 20% of its activity in six consecutive cycles of the reaction hydrolysis of tributyrin. The immobilization influenced the enantioselectivity of CRL. Using nanoZrO2-A-CRL under optimal reaction condition in the reaction of esterification of lauric acid with (\u00b1)-menthol, we achieved menthol conversion of 43% (i.e. 82% of (\u2212) methyl laurate), enantiomeric excess of 97% and enantiomeric ratio of 144.

Electrochemical regeneration systems, in which an electrode serves as electron donor, provide an alternative route to enzymatic redox reactions. Mediators are often used to accelerate electron transfer between electrode and enzyme. We investigated the mediated bioelectrochemical conversion of p-xylene to 2,5-dimethylphenol (2,5-DMP) by a P450 BM3 variant and were able to produce 2,5-DMP electrochemically. Due to the fact that mediator reduction is limited by the electrode surface a scale-up was performed. However, increasing the electrode surface area to reactor volume ratio led to a drastic increase in cathodic oxygen reduction, causing a drop in product formation. It was shown that reduced cobalt sepulchrate reacts with the co-substrate oxygen. Furthermore, the reportedly oxygen stable mediator [Cp*Rh(I)(bpy)H]+ was compared to cobalt sepulchrate. While its turnover frequency is of comparable magnitude to cobalt sepulchrate when transferring the electrons between electrode and enzyme, using NADP+ as intermediary between the mediator and the enzyme significantly increased the mediator's turnover frequency. The rhodium mediator [Cp*Rh(I)(bpy)H]+ does not appear to be significantly more oxygen stable.",

Free fatty acids, in particular oleic acid were esterified with glycerol. The reaction seems to follow a multisubstrate Ping Pong mechanism with competitive inhibition by the acyl acceptors (mono-, diacylglycerides and glycerol). Free fatty acid content did not affect lipase activity within the ranges investigated. The kinetic parameters were determined and showed that enzyme affinity is much higher to glycerol than to free fatty acids. These observations were supported by the fact that the optimum glycerol level is rather small while the reaction rate increases with increasing free fatty acid concentration.",

The gene Calkro_0081 encoded a novel GH11 xylanase (Xyn11A) with a catalytic domain (GH-CD) and a carbohydrate binding module (CBM6). The native Xyn11A and two corresponded truncations Xyn11A-CD (catalytic domain of Xyn11A) and Xyn11A-CBM (carbohydrate binding module of Xyn11A) were respectively cloned, heterologously expressed, and biochemically characterized. The recombinant Xyn11A is active in a wide temperature range from 40 to 95\u00a0\u00b0C with the highest activity at 75\u00a0\u00b0C. Xyn11A was completely stable at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h and more than 50% activity was retained after incubation for 6\u00a0h at 75\u00a0\u00b0C. The optimum pH of Xyn11A was 6.0, and it retained 100% activity after 15\u00a0h incubation in pH 5.5\u20137.5\u00a0at 70\u00a0\u00b0C. As for Xyn11A-CD, the optimal pH value and temperature were 6.0 and 65\u00a0\u00b0C, the residual activity retained 30% after 6\u00a0h at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The respective specific activities of Xyn11A, Xyn11A-CD, and Xyn11A-CBM were 1752.0, 986.8, and 0\u00a0IU/mg on beechwood xylan (BWX) at optimum conditions. The activity of Xyn11A is the highest among the reported thermostable xylanases at 75\u00a0\u00b0C. Using BWX as substrate, the final products were xylose and xylobiose after hydrolysis with Xyn11A or Xyn11A-CD. No hydrolytic activity of CBM6 was found, while which shows crucial functions on thermostability and activity for Xyn11A. The characteristics of thermostability and high activity make Xyn11A a potential enzyme for industry application.",

Here, we describe how acetyl moieties protecting hydroxyl groups of the glycosides make these molecules better inhibitors to the enzyme activity. In particular, the presence of a unique hydroxyl group in the peracetylated glycosides still enhanced the inhibitory capacity of the molecule more. Molecular docking studies showed that the acetylation in the carbohydrate structure helps the substrate to accommodate into the active site. From a small biocatalytic synthesized library of different monohydroxy acetylated glycosides we can conclude that galactosidic structures are better for inhibition capacity. The best inhibitors were two monohydroxy lactal derivatives. The one with the OH free, in C-6 of the galactosidic part of the disaccharide, was a better inhibitor (Ki of 95\u00a0\u03bcM) than that with the OH free in C-3 in the glucosidic part of the molecule (Ki of 143\u00a0\u03bcM).",

     "abstract": "\u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is widely used as a pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and as a precursor for synthesizing materials for industrial use. Bacterial cells can be exploited for use as biocatalysts with the potential to synthesize compounds such as GABA with greater efficiency, safety, and economy. However, efforts to use biocatalysts must overcome the permeability barrier of the cell envelope. Therefore, to produce a whole-cell biocatalyst with enhanced cell-associated glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity, we overexpressed the Glutamate (Glu)-GABA antiporter (GadC) in Escherichia coli (BL21(DE3)-pET28a-gadB). The cell-associated GAD activity of the transformants was higher by a factor of 2.6 in comparison; however, expression of GadC inhibited growth. Therefore, we permeabilized the cells using either organic solvents, surfactants, or heat. Permeabilization with organic solvents increased cell-associated GAD activity as a function of their hydrophobicity, and hexane was the most effective, increasing cell-associated GAD activity by a factor of 9.65 (6.72\u00a0U/mg). The surfactants Triton X-100, CHAPS, NP-40, OGP, and Brij-35 enhanced cell-associated GAD activity, and Triton X-100 was the most effective, increasing cell-associated GAD activity by a factor of 10.8 (7.53\u00a0U/mg). Heating BL21(DE3)-pET28a-gadB at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min increased cell-associated GAD activity by a factor of 13.1. GAD did not leak from the permeabilized cells under optimum conditions. When the heat-permeabilized cells were immobilized on Ca-alginate gel beads, the biotransformation ability of beads maintained over 60% of their initial ability after 20 consecutive batches, and the beads retained 90% of their initial activity after 30 days of storage. These approaches for improving cell permeability to enhance cell-associated GAD activity show great promise for decreasing the cost of industrial production of GABA.",

To date, most of the cloned BVMOs available are derived from bacteria, although Baeyer-Villiger oxidations using fungi have frequently been demonstrated. Here we report the cloning and characterization of four BVMOs from the fungus Aspergillus flavus NRRL3357. Phylogenetic analysis shows these four BVMOs to cluster in a distinct group apart from other well-characterized BVMOs including cyclohexanone, phenylacetone and 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase. Building on the Grogan classification/clustering of BVMOs, we have designated this new group of BVMOs, Group VI. Group VI BVMOs show an early divergence from the cyclopentanone monooxygenase (CPMO) type BVMOs (Group I). Substrate profiling using cyclic, bicyclic, aliphatic and aryl ketones show a clear divergence in function and specificity not only between this new group of BVMOs and the CPMO-type BVMOs, but also between the four A. flavus BVMO paralogues despite their high sequence similarity. This study not only contributes to the growing number of available BVMOs, but also addresses the current classification of Type I BVMOs, and the usefulness of phylogenetic clustering and prediction of function and selectivity when genome-mining is used to search for new biocatalysts.",

Although having advantages like higher enzyme stability, easy enzyme separation and recovery, product streams without the used enzyme, and the possibility of continuous processes, the use of immobilized enzymes in big scale process volumes concentrates on well-known enzymes like Glucose isomerase, Lipase, Lactase and Penicillin G acylase, although there is a lot more potential for immobilized enzymes in preparative and industrial applications. For a broader use of immobilized enzymes in a repetitive way it is necessary to have a reliable process analytics with regard to the immobilizates. While working on the adoption of immobilized proteases for biotransformation reactions in biotechnological and pharmaceutical industrial processes, we found no established method to measure the amount of immobilized enzymes on the carrier directly, as mostly only the activity of the immobilizates is analyzed. We propose a method to quantify the immobilized enzymes directly on non-porous polyvinyl alcohol magnetic beads using well-established Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The method utilizes the Attenuated Total Reflection mode and a multivariate, chemometric model. Two models, one for adsorptive and one for covalent immobilization of the protease bovine \u03b1-Chymotrypsin, are developed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method for the use in process analytics.",

Acyltransferase A was partially purified while acyltransferase B was purified to homogeneity by a four steps process with a purification fold of 12.1 and 37.5% yield. Acyltransferase A was found to have affinity for only short chain aliphatic amides with maximum activity towards acetamide. In contrast acyltransferase B had a broad substrate spectrum with highest acyltransferase activity for nicotinamide and exhibited significant high acyltransferase to amide hydrolase activity ratio for various amides. Purified acyltransferase B was a monomeric protein with molecular mass of 63\u00a0kDa. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that acyltransferase B was \u03b1\u03b2 protein with 39% \u03b1-helix, 17% \u03b2-sheet and 26% random coils. The optimum temperature and pH of acyltransferase B were 45\u00a0\u00b0C and 7.0 respectively. Catalytic efficiency of acyltransferase B was relatively high with a Kcat/Kmamide and K cat /Km NH 2 OH of 32.0\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 and 2.47\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 respectively. Heavy metals and thiol modifying reagents inhibited acyltransferase activity while DTT caused a 2.2 fold increase in activity. Furthermore, acyltransferase B showed tolerance to many polar and non polar organic solvents (10\u201330%, v/v) which is promising for the synthesis of hydrophobic hydroxamic acids. This acyltransferase B has been shown to be of potential use for hydroxamic acid synthesis owing to its high ratio of acyltransferase to amide hydrolase activities and its considerable organic solvent compatibility.",

To equalize allosteric pathway in EMGS with TMGS, ten amino acid residues, containing Arg150, are omitted from the EMGS C-terminal tail. The resulting recombinant enzyme (EMGS-\u0394C) surprisingly shows homotropic cooperative behavior in presence of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Structural studies and irreversible thermoinactivation data shows EMGS-\u0394C is not only more flexible but also less stable compared to wild-type EMGS. These data suggest EMGS C-terminal tail may play an important role in allosteric behavior and stability of wild-type EMGS and thus indicating that the homotropic cooperativity is arisen by binding of the substrate which pushes the pre-existing equilibrium between the relatively inactive (RI) and relatively active (RA) conformations.",

     "abstract": "For the past decades, the global trends in the demand of cellulase has been arisen due to its extensive range of applications in food and agriculture industry, and its potential use in the fermentation of biomass into biofuels. However, the instability, highly solubility in water, low catalytic efficiency and high cost of enzyme has become the main obstacles for the development of large scale operations and applications. In this study, cellulase enzyme was immobilized onto functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via physical adsorption method to yield a stable and ease of separate enzyme. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) are used to confirm the successful immobilization of cellulase enzyme. In this approach, the efficiency of enzyme immobilization reaches an optimal value when 4\u00a0mg/mL enzyme concentration is used in which approximately 97% enzyme loading can be attained. Based on the UV\u2013visible spectroscopy analysis, the optimum reaction conditions for immobilized cellulase are at pH 5 and a temperature of 50\u00a0\u00b0C. Results have revealed that MWCNT\u2013cellulase composite still retained 52% of its cellulase activity after six cycles of the CMC analysis. This feature is beneficial to the industrial applications because of its potential to be easily separated from the end product at the end of the reaction, reuse for multiple times and allow the development of multiple enzyme reaction system.",

Three variants of the enzyme (TnBgl1A_E349G, TnBgl1A_E349A and TnBgl1A_E349S), mutated at the catalytic nucleophile, were constructed to evaluate their glycosynthase activity towards oligosaccharide synthesis. Two approaches were used for the synthesis reactions, both of which utilized 4-nitrophenyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (4NPGlc) as an acceptor molecule: the first using an \u03b1-glucosyl fluoride donor at low temperature (35\u00a0\u00b0C) in a classical glycosynthase reaction, and the second by in situ generation of the glycosyl donor with (4NPGlc), where formate served as the exogenous nucleophile under higher temperature (70\u00a0\u00b0C). Using the first approach, TnBgl1A_E349G and TnBgl1A_E349A synthesized disaccharides with \u03b2-1,3-linkages in good yields (up to 61%) after long incubations (15\u00a0h). However, the GH1 glycosynthase Bgl3_E383A from a mesophilic Streptomyces sp., used as reference enzyme, generated a higher yield at the same temperature with both a shorter reaction time and a lower enzyme concentration. The second approach yielded disaccharides for all three mutants with predominantly \u03b2-1,3-linkages (up to 45%) but also \u03b2-1,4-linkages (up to 12.5%), after 7\u00a0h reaction time. The TnBgl1A glycosynthases were also used for glycosylation of flavonoids, using the two described approaches. Quercetin-3-glycoside was tested as an acceptor molecule and the resultant product was quercetin-3,4\u2032-diglycosides in significantly lower yields, indicating that TnBgl1A preferentially selects 4NPGlc as the acceptor.",

     "abstract": "Efficient cellulose saccharification is crucial for the cost-effective production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. Most \u03b2-glucosidases are inhibited by glucose, and high enzyme loads are needed to attain acceptable hydrolysis yields, increasing the process costs. Therefore, glucose-stimulated \u03b2-glucosidases with high catalytic efficiency for cellobiose hydrolysis are highly interesting, particularly those produced at low cost using convenient expression systems. The bglhi gene from Humicola insolens RP86, which encodes a glucose- and xylose-stimulated \u03b2-glucosidase (Bglhi), was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant Bglhi was expressed in soluble form and dynamic light scattering showed that the protein was monomeric (56.1\u00a0kDa). The enzyme showed broad substrate specificity, with optima of pH and temperature of 5.0\u20137.0 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C, and was stable from pH 4.5 to 8.0, and for 1\u00a0h at 50\u00a0\u00b0C in water. The recombinant Bglhi was highly stimulated by glucose and xylose. About 2-fold stimulation of pNP-glucosidase activity occurred at 50\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121 glucose or 100\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121 xylose. In addition, stimulation was observed over 50\u2013370\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121 glucose or 100\u20131000\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121 xylose. Xylose maximally stimulated (2.3-fold) the cellobiase activity of the enzyme at 80\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121 concentration. The Vmax for cellobiose hydrolysis (183.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.0\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u22121) was 5-fold higher than that for pNP-Glc (36.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u22121), but a lower KM for pNP-Glc (0.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121), compared to cellobiose (0.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121), was estimated. More importantly, the recombinant Bglhi presented the highest catalytic efficiency for cellobiose hydrolysis (kcat/KM\u00a0=\u00a0453.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.6\u00a0s\u22121\u00a0mmol\u22121\u00a0L) among all glucose-stimulated and glucose-tolerant \u03b2-glucosidases known to date. Together, these properties indicate that the recombinant Bglhi is an attractive candidate to include in enzymatic cocktails for application in industrial processes for the saccharification of lignocellulosic materials.",

The recombinant lipase activity reached 25,000\u00a0U/L after optimization. Different carriers were used to immobilize the recombinant S. marcescens lipase (SmL), and LH-EP was found to be the most ideal carrier. LH-EP immobilized SmL could catalyze enantioselective resolution of racemic alcohols. Using 4-phenyl-2-butanol as the model alcohol, the effects of temperature, organic solvent, water activity, acyl donor and substrate molar ratio on the LH-EP immobilized SmL catalyzed kinetic resolution were investigated. All of these factors influenced the resolution effect to some extent. At last, a high E value of more than 200 was achieved, with eeS\u00a0>\u00a099% and a conversion of 49.9%. Further studies showed that the LH-EP immobilized SmL could also catalyze the kinetic resolution of other structure similar racemic alcohols. These results indicate that the SmL is useful for biocatalytic production of chiral alcohols. This work is the first attempt of using SmL in this field, and it further broadens the application field of SmL.",

Furthermore, we also address novel approaches to enhance stability and activity of recombinant lipases, such as VHb gene co-expression, multi-enzyme co-display technique, and the micro-environmental interference and self-assembly techniques. Finally, we represent the variety of applications of whole cell surface displayed lipases on yeast cells in non-aqueous phases, including synthesis of esters, PUFA enrichment, resolution of chiral drugs, organic synthesis and biofuels. We demonstrate that the lipase surface display technique is a powerful tool for functionalizing yeasts to serve as whole cell catalysts, and increasing interest is providing an impetus for broad application of this technique.",

Sucrose laurate was obtained in yields from 12 to 53% after 48\u00a0h under different catalytic conditions. The serine protease ALP-901, derived from a Streptomyces sp., produced the highest yield at this reaction time, while reaction with the zinc-protease thermolysin achieved the overall highest yield (63%) after 6\u00a0h, with only monoesters synthesised. The total conversion of sucrose after 48\u00a0h ranged from 19 to 96%. The highest degree of conversion was observed in the reaction with thermolysin, while the reactions without protein and with ALP-901 resulted in 82% and 66% sucrose conversion, respectively. 2-O-Lauroyl sucrose was the most abundant monoester regioisomer synthesised and the highest concentration observed was 23.7\u00a0mM after 24\u00a0h in the thermolysin-catalysed reaction. The highest concentration of 2-O-lauroyl sucrose detected in the reaction catalysed by ALP-901 was 19.0\u00a0mM, while it was 17.0\u00a0mM the reaction without protein, both after 48\u00a0h. The detected appearance of the sucrose laurate regioisomers largely corresponded to the apparent rates of formation, and 2-O-lauroyl sucrose was among the first regioisomers to appear in all reactions. The observed sucrose laurate regioisomeric distribution after 48\u00a0h (2:3:4:6:1\u2032:3\u2032) was 72:5:2:1:7:14 in the reaction catalysed by ALP-901, and 74:5:2:1:7:13 in the reaction without protein.

Non-catalytic protein in the reaction medium seemed to lower the catalytic activity of the molecular sieves.",

Immobilized Lipozyme RM IM from Mucor miehei was shown to be the best biocatalyst for the production of TMHQ-1-MA through regioselective transesterification between trimethylhydroquinone diacetate (TMHQ-DA) and alcohol. The effects of lipase-catalyzed reaction conditions including solvent, acyl receptor, substrate mole ratio, reaction temperature and agitation speed were investigated. The optimum conditions for Lipozyme RM IM catalyzed regioselective transesterification were achieved at a substrate mole ratio of 1:1, an agitation of 200\u00a0rpm at 50\u00a0\u00b0C in MTBE/n-hexane (3:7). Under the above conditions, Lipozyme RM IM exhibited high substrate tolerance (substrate concentrations of 1.06\u00a0M). Recycling experiments demonstrated that Lipozyme RM IM was quite steady under the reaction conditions. The analysis of kinetic experiment showed that the enzymatic reaction obeys the Ping\u2013Pong bi\u2013bi mechanism with n-butanol inhibition.",

Therefore, investigating the mechanisms underlying how enzyme activity is changed by mutations may have widespread clinical and industrial applications as well as understanding of enzyme catalysis. In this paper, various reported mutants of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme were analyzed to investigate the relationship between enzyme activity and flexibility. The activity-enhanced mutants of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme demonstrated a tendency for mutations to localize to the edge of helices and to involve substitutions to flexible amino acids such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Additionally, the mutated residues were shown to demonstrate increased flexibility in B-factor. These findings suggest that flexibility modulation may be a feasible means to enhance enzyme activity.",

The lipase from Burkholderia ambifaria YCJ01 was immobilized on the comb copolymer modified TiO2. The activity of immobilized lipase YCJ01 showed that comb polymer which side chain with a molecular weight of 1000 was the best material for the functionalization of TiO2.

However, it is often challenging to implement oxidative reactions at scale due to the low activity and stability of the biocatalyst under industrial conditions. Consequently, it becomes critical to identify the bottlenecks for specific oxidation reactions as a first step in scale-up. Subsequently, we can identify where research the effort is required when developing a biocatalytic reaction for implementation in an industrial reaction, i.e., on biocatalyst development (e.g. improvement of expression levels), process development (e.g. improved oxygen supply, product removal strategies) or biocatalyst stabilization (e.g. through immobilization or directed evolution).

The structure of TADH in complex with NADH has been determined and refined to a resolution of 2.74\u00a0\u00c5. The structure reveals structural features commensurate with known stabilising factors of thermostable MDRs, including shorter peripheral loops and an increased amount of inter- and intra-subunit salt bridges and hydrogen bonds compared to mesophilic MDRs of known structure. A study of the active site reveals the molecular determinants of NADH and substrate binding in TADH that help to shed light on observed differences in cofactor specificity and stereoselectivity when compared to its thermophilic NADPH-dependent homolog from Thermoanaerobium brockii (TbADH).

     "abstract": "The application of lipase catalysis to the production of biodiesel has received much interest during the past several years. Although most of the previous work has involved the use of immobilized enzyme, more recent work has indicated that liquid formulations of lipase can provide a highly competitive option for the conversion of oils and fats to biodiesel. This study investigates the impact of several process parameters on the production of fatty acid ethyl esters from rapeseed oil in a pure batch process on the liquid lipase formulation Callera\u2122 Trans L. Oil conversion in excess of 98% was achieved by combining a 50% stoichiometric excess of ethanol (1.5 equivalents) with 20% (w/w) water relative to the oil. The rate of reaction was directly proportional to the amount of lipase added in this system (500\u20132000\u00a0LU per gram oil). Addition of glycerol to the initial reaction mixture reduced the initial reaction rate, but also improved the final yield of biodiesel by suppressing hydrolysis.",

This activity had an alkaline pH optimum and a moderate tolerance to the presence of organic solvents, appealing features for its possible biotechnological uses. An increase of the \u03b1-L-rhamnosidase activity in PP1Y crude extracts was induced by adding naringin to the growth medium, suggesting the possibility to use material from Citrus industrial waste to induce the glycosidase activity expressed by strain PP1Y and produce simultaneously high-added-value molecules from the hydrolysis of their flavonoids.

The physicochemical properties of CHO-MCFs were characterized by SAXS, nitrogen sorption, TEM, elementary analysis, solid state 29Si MAS NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetry. The results show that the aldehydepropyl groups have been grafted successfully on the surface of MCFs, and after functionalization, the BET surface area and pore volume of CHO-MCFs decrease, but the ultra-large and continuous 3D mesoporous structure of CHO-MCFs are retained to be beneficial for immobilization of PGA with large size and diffusion of substrates and products. PGA is immobilized covalently on CHO-MCFs via the reaction to produce Schiff's base between the free amino groups of lysine residues of PGA and the aldehyde groups on the surface of CHO-MCFs, which greatly increases the operational stability of the immobilized PGA with little activity loss due to the short-chain groups of aldehydepropyl grafted on the surface of CHO-MCFs.

The influence of methanol on the activity of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) upon hydrolysis of tributyrin was investigated by enzyme kinetics analysis. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and circular dichroism (CD) was used to measure the variation of hydrodynamic diameter and secondary structure change of CALB at different methanol concentration, respectively. A concentration-dependent influence of methanol on CALB was observed. The activity of CALB slightly increased with less than 1.2\u00a0mol\u00a0l\u22121 of methanol, followed by sustained decrease at higher methanol concentrations. DLS result indicated that the negative effect of methanol on CALB was supposed to follow different mechanisms due to the significant variation of particle size of CALB at different methanol concentrations. Both reversible competitive inhibition based on enzymatic kinetics analysis and inactivation based on CD spectroscopy study were supposed to contribute to the negative effect of methanol on CALB with methanol concentration in the range of 1.2\u00a0mol\u00a0l\u22121 to 6\u00a0mol\u00a0l\u22121.

The biocatalyst was inactivated down to 25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% of residual activity using 70% (v/v) of dioxane and afterwards it was reactivated. Biocatalyst kinetic behavior, reflected in the Michaelis constant (KM) and inhibition constant PAA (KI), could not be restored by reactivation and conformational changes induced by the organic solvent were reflected in different intrinsic kinetic parameters of the native and reactivated biocatalyst. The significant variation of biocatalyst kinetic parameters due to its inactivation and reactivation should be considered when the enzyme reactor performance is modeled, aspect which has not been given sufficient attention up to now.",

Analysis of variance showed that the obtained mathematical model is significant to carry out further studies. The biochemical properties of this bio-conjugate experienced a slight shift from the optimum of its free form equivalent. This change was found favourable with respect to its utilization in industrial sector. Optimal pH and temperature were 6.0 and 70\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Though there was not much change in optimum temperature but the immobilized enzyme was functionally active at higher temperatures. Immobilization showed positive effect when thermal inactivation at 67\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in first-order kinetics with t1/2 126\u00a0min. It retained 77% residual activity after 10 uses and 80% residual activity on 2 months of storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. These properties provide impetus for its utility for commercial purpose.

At the moment, large scale application of YtbE has been complicated by uncertain thermal and operational stabilities. Consequently, we endeavored possible enzyme inactivation mechanism, and showed that (a) unfolding of YtbE explains enzyme activity loss, and (b) YtbE dimerization has a less significant effect owing to a small quantity detected. The effects of substrate and temperature on YtbE are mostly upheld by a one-step inactivation model, whereas the effect of product by a 2-step activity reduction modality. Partially based on these new understandings, a multi-factor experimental strategy was rationalized for improving the YtbE stability. For instance, glycerol was introduced to reduce enzyme unfolding whilst dithiothreitol to suppress its dimerization. This improved substrate conversion from 62.9% to 98.7%, and from 70.5% to 96.6% at 0.1\u00a0M and 1.0\u00a0M CBFM, respectively, with YtbE half-life being increased from 46.6\u00a0min to 159\u00a0min.",

Among them, the so-called DyP-type peroxidases (DyPs) that are secreted under conditions close to nature (i.e. in wood cultures) are of particular interest, since they are able to oxidize diverse substrates including veratryl alcohol, non-phenolic lignin model dimers as well as recalcitrant phenols and dyes. In spite of their unique protein structure and their catalytic versatility, the estimation of the redox potential of this new peroxidase group is still pending. To solve this problem, we used a catalytic approach developed by Ayala et al., 2007 [21], which is based on the Marcus equation and the determination of the redox thermodynamics between heme-peroxidase compound II and the resting state enzyme. Five fungal DyPs (among them four wild-type enzymes and one recombinant protein) were tested regarding phenol oxidation in comparison to other well-studied plant and fungal peroxidases (soybean peroxidase, SBP, Coprinopsis cinerea peroxidase, CiP, lignin peroxidase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium, LiP). DyP-type peroxidases have a high affinity for phenols and can oxidize even recalcitrant representatives such as p-nitrophenol. Based on this \u201cphenol oxidation method\u201d, their redox potential was estimated to range between 1.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 and 1.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0V, which is between the values calculated for high-redox potential LiP (1.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0V) and low-redox potential, phenol-oxidizing plant (0.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0V for SBP) and fungal (1.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0V for CiP) peroxidases.",

     "abstract": "The heterogeneous enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by a polyester hydrolase (TfCut2) from Thermobifida fusca KW3 was determined by measuring the change of intensity of transmitted light due to the scattering effect of PET nanoparticles immobilized in an agarose gel. Nanoparticles with a mean diameter between 100 and 160\u00a0nm were prepared from PET samples of different crystallinity to provide a large surface area for the adsorption of the enzyme. The turbidity decrease of the PET nanoparticle suspensions was correlated to the surface erosion process resulting from the enzymatic degradation, and enabled a direct estimation of the kinetic parameters of the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET based on a model for heterogeneous biocatalysis. A comparison of the hydrolysis rate constants and the adsorption equilibrium constants of the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET nanoparticles prepared from recycled PET granulate, film and fibres showed that the biodegradability of PET was mainly influenced by the mobility of the polyester chains, which determined the affinity and accessibility of the ester bonds to the enzyme. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis of the partially hydrolyzed PET nanoparticles provided indirect evidence for an endo-type hydrolytic mechanism of TfCut2 in the heterogeneous degradation of aromatic polyesters.",

Here we present a proof-of-concept approach for the cultivation of cell suspension cultures exclusively containing laticifers. We transformed T. brevicorniculatum plants with a plasmid conferring laticifer-specific hygromycin resistance. Transgenic callus tissue was used to induce a cell suspension culture under antibiotic selection to favor laticifer growth. The cultured cells appeared laticiferous in terms of morphology and expressed laticifer-specific genes. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed intracellular lipid accumulation in vesicle-like structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance and diffusion ordered spectroscopy indicated the presence of mid-length poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) chains but no high HMW natural rubber in the cells. Precursor feeding with mevalonolactone increased the accumulation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) by 17-fold, reaching a concentration of 2.7\u00a0mg/g dry weight.

In this study, we found that CO2 was a direct substrate for formate formation with Candida boidinii formate dehydrogenase (CbsFDH), but HCO3\u2212 was not. Enzymatic formate formation with CbsFDH was inhibited at NADH concentrations higher than 0.35\u00a0mM. Electrochemical NADH regeneration was performed at a Cu electrode using the [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]+ complex, which catalyzed the conversion of NAD+ into the active NADH with almost 100% selectivity. The electroenzymatic reaction for HCO2H formation was conducted at 1.0\u00a0V, 0.25\u00a0mM NADH and 0.25\u00a0mM Rh complex during electrochemical NADH regeneration. CO2 was reduced into formate by enzymatic catalysis under the NADH regeneration condition, where protons and electrons was continuously supplied into a cathode cell through Nafion\u00ae membrane from water splitting at a Pt anode. The interactions of the Cu electrode, Rh mediator, NADH, and CbsFDH were analyzed for the first time. The Rh(III) mediator was hydrolyzed and reduced reversibly into a Rh(I) intermediate (Mred1) as well as irreversibly into a Rh(I) hydride intermediate (Mred2) at the Cu electrode. Interestingly, the Rh(I) species showed activity toward the direct reduction of CO2 as well as NADH regeneration, although the primary CO2 reduction occurred through CbsFDH at 1.0\u00a0V.",

     "abstract": "Free lipase-mediated biodiesel production has been drawing great attention for its lower cost and faster reaction rate compared to immobilized lipase. Since biodiesel derived from vegetable oils may cause competition with food supply, the exploration of crude vegetable oils as well as microbial oils as the feedstock has aroused great interest worldwide. It is reported that those crude oils usually contain some amount of phospholipids, typically with content varying from 2% to 10%. Our previous study showed that phospholipids content within 2% in the oil feedstock was even beneficial to free lipase NS81006-catalyzed biodiesel production. However, there was no research about the influence of much higher phospholipids content on free lipase-mediated methanolysis for biodiesel production. In this paper, the effect of varied content of phospholipids on free lipase NS81006-mediated biodiesel production as well as the related mechanism was investigated for the first time. It was found that both the catalytic performance and reuse stability of free lipase NS81006 were inhibited with more than 5% phospholipids contained in the oil feedstock. Exploration on the related influence mechanism revealed that either phospholipids or methanol (with appropriate addition strategy) alone did not have negative effect on the catalytic performance of the lipase, while the coexistence of phospholipids and methanol in the system led to significant inhibitory effect on the lipase. The further exploration indicated that with the increase of phospholipids content, the amount of solubilized methanol gradually increased in the micelle, which may subsequently result in negative effect on the enzyme's catalytic performance.",

     "abstract": "l-Arabinose isomerase is an intracellular enzyme that can convert l-arabinose to l-ribulose and d-galactose to d-tagatose, a promising but rare nutraceutical. Most of l-arabinose isomerases purified up to date employed the combination between DNA recombinant technology and affinity chromatography based on poly-histidine tail recognition, but few of the enzymes were obtained and purified in a non-recombinant way. For these reasons, a specific affinity bioadsorbent containing l-arabitol as ligand, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, was designed and synthesized for achieving pure preparations of the enzyme l-arabinose isomerase from wild-type Enterococcus faecium DBFIQ E36 strain, isolated from raw cow milk.The two-step purification procedure consisted in fractionation by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography with obtained bioadsorbent, allowing the purification, to electrophoretical homogeneity, of target enzyme. Characterization studies were performed with purified l-arabinose isomerase in order to increase knowledge of their physicochemical properties. In this sense, enzyme exhibited an optimum temperature of 50\u00a0\u00b0C and optimum pH of 7.0, maintaining good stability in the ranges 20\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 6.5\u20138. Ki were calculated, employing d-galactose as substrate, for l-arabitol and l-ribitol, achieving values of 7.9\u00a0mM and 183\u00a0mM, respectively. Km and Vmax values obtained were 35\u00a0mM and 81\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u22121 at 50\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.

Eco-efficiency analysis was used as an optimisation tool to create more sustainable solutions and improve subsequent reactions, enabling the scaled-up biocatalytic process to become more economical and competitive compared with the chemocatalysed procedure using sodium iodate. When working with higher substrate concentrations (up to 100\u00a0mM), the following key aspects must also be considered: (1) the low solubility of n-hexylamine and the reaction products in aqueous solution, and (2) the poor stability of enzymes in unconventional solvents. The present study includes activity and stability experiments using laccases in methanol, a suitable solvent for the hydrophobic compound n-hexylamine. Contrary to previously published reports, excellent activities were obtained using Novozym 51003 at high methanol contents and substrate concentrations up to 100\u00a0mM.

     "abstract": "The rare monosaccharide d-tagatose is a low-calorie sugar-substituting sweetener, having 92% of relative sweetness but only 1/3 of energy content of sucrose. Industrial production of d-tagatose is carried out from d-galactose by l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI). It is generally recognized that commercial l-AI for d-tagatose production requires two important enzymatic properties, thermostability and slightly acidic pH optimum. In this article, a thermostable l-AI was characterized from a novel thermoacidophilic bacterium, Alicyclobacillus hesperidum URH17-3-68, which showed promising thermostability and displayed a relatively wide pH spectrum. The araA gene encoding the Al. hesperiduml-AI was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity by heat treatment and ion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme displayed maximal activity at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 7.0, and showed more than 75% of maximal activity from pH 5.5 to 7.0. Cobalt ion was required as optimum metal cofactor for both activity simulation and thermostability improvement at high temperature. The enzyme retained 93% and 63% of initial activity after 4 and 16\u00a0h of incubation, respectively, at 75\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of Co2+. The Michaelis\u2013Menten constant (Km), turnover number (kcat), and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for substrate d-galactose were measured to be 54.7\u00a0mM, 68.0\u00a0min\u22121, and 1.2\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0min\u22121, respectively. The bioconversion yield of d-tagatose by the purified enzyme after 27\u00a0h at 70\u00a0\u00b0C reached 43% and 22%, from 50 and 200\u00a0mM of d-galactose, respectively. Due to the promising thermostability and high activity at slight acidic pH, the Al. hesperiduml-AI was appropriate for use as a new source of d-tagatose producing enzyme.",

The aim was to compare the volume productivity (QP) as well as biocatalyst productivity number (BPN) of these two continuous reactor systems. Influence of geometry, surface roughness of the microchannel walls, and inner mixing in the microreactors on conversion were also tested. In all used microreactors full conversion of benzaldehyde was achieved at residence times longer than 4\u00a0min. This was not the case in the UFMR where BFD was \u201csoluble\u201d immobilized because of the enzyme instability under the working conditions. The microreactor with inner mixing (micromixers) showed higher conversion at residence times shorter than 2\u00a0min (higher flow rates); while at longer residence times there were no significant differences between the different microreactor types.

     "abstract": "Pasteurella multocida hyaluronan synthase (PmHAS) encompasses two transferase domains that elongate a growing hyaluronan (HA) oligosaccharide chain by addition of either GlcNAc or GlcUA residues from a corresponding UDP-sugar. Initial velocity studies of single-step elongations were conducted for both domains by independently varying the concentrations of the HA oligosaccharide and the UDP-sugar. Two-substrate models were discriminated by their goodness-of-fit parameters and by dead-end inhibition studies. A mechanistic shift from a steady-state ordered bi-bi to rapid equilibrium ordered bi-bi mechanism was observed at the NAc-site between the HA6 and HA8 elongation. This shift was invoked by a minor reduction in turnover number kcat. Both NAc- and UA-transferase domains follow a sequential kinetic mechanism, most likely an ordered one in which the UDP-sugar donor binds first, followed by the HA oligosaccharide. After transfer of the sugar moiety, both products are released, first the elongated HA oligosaccharide and then the UDP sugar. This mechanism was visualized with a structural model of PmHAS that presented two flexible loops, one in each transferase domain; these loops form a bridge above the active site. Based on structural similarities between PmHAS with \u03b11,3-galactosyltransferase (\u03b13GT) and \u03b21,4-galactosyltransferase (\u03b24Gal-T1), these flexible loops are seemingly involved in a conformational change upon binding the UDP-sugar, inducing the ordered mechanism. Kinetic analyses have demonstrated significant differences in dissociation constant KD,UA and KM,NAc of 124\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031\u00a0\u03bcM and 28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8\u00a0mM, respectively, suggesting that the variance in the binding affinity of the two UDP-sugars controls the molecular weight of hyaluronan.",

In this study, a novel type of biocatalyst, meta-cleavage product (MCP) hydrolase (MfphA and BphD) displayed on the surface of Bacillus subtilis 168 spores, was developed for the transformation of HODAs. The successful display of CotG-MfphA and CotG-BphD fusion protein on the surface of spore were confirmed by western blot analysis and activity measurement. The optimal transformation conditions by spore surface-displayed MfphA and BphD were found to be 70\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 7. The thermal and pH stability analysis exhibited that spore surface-displayed MfphA and BphD were stable and retained more than 80% of relative activities even at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 10. Meanwhile, recycling experiments showed that the conversion percentage of HODA by surface-displayed MfphA and BphD were not significantly decreased throughout the reutilization process, which still retained 45% and 70% at the tenth cycle, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report concerning the B. subtilis 168 spore surface-displayed MCP hydrolases. The high activities and good recycle performance suggested that this novel biocatalyst system could serve as a suitable alternative for HODAs transformation.",

Optimal conditions for enzymatic studies were determined to be pH 6.0\u20136.5 and 28\u00a0\u00b0C. The partially purified PPO presented high activity toward catechol (Vmax 3.42\u00a0U\u00a0mL\u22121 and Km 6.47\u00a0mM) and 4-methylcatechol (Vmax 3.01\u00a0U\u00a0mL\u22121 and Km 0.15\u00a0mM) and low activity toward phenol being classified as a catecholase type polyphenol oxidase. S. lycocarpum PPO was sensitive to inhibitors such as l-cysteine, sodium metabisulfite, ascorbic acid, thiourea and citric acid. l-Cysteine was the most effective inhibitor, presenting a competitive inhibition. The results from kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the thermal inactivation evidenced that the partially purified PPO is a biocatalyst, whose inactivation process is related to aggregation of partially unfolded enzyme molecules.",

     "abstract": "Immobilization of enzymes on glutaraldehyde-activated supports has been largely used on supports previously activated with amine groups. Therefore, the supports are positively charged hence usually the immobilization is promoted through a two step mechanism: in a first step the enzyme is adsorbed on the support via an anionic exchange mechanism and then, the covalent immobilization occurs. In this paper a new glutaraldehyde activated support without a net charge is presented and characterized in immobilizations of trypsin, penicillin acylase G, lipase and E. coli BL21 cell extract. Immobilization mechanism was studied and this was produced without an adsorption step. This support promoted initially a reversible immobilization, converting into irreversible after incubation of the enzyme-support for several days or after a reduction step. In addition the stability of glutaraldehyde groups was studied retaining around 50 and 25% of its immobilization capacity for 24\u00a0h at pH 7 and 10 respectively. This fact allows the incubation of the enzyme with the support even at alkaline pH promoting an extra stabilization factor for trypsin on this support.",

Properties, like hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding capability of the enzyme active site were computed by means of the GRID method and the output was used as molecular descriptors. Correlations with experimental behavior of the catalysts were calculated by means of partial least square regression (PLS). The analysis of the QSAR model fully exploits fundamental knowledge while avoiding conceptual biases. Rationales for driving enzyme engineering are disclosed and a priori evaluation of new virtual candidate mutants becomes feasible. On that respect, the whole procedure for production of virtual mutants and scoring of their activity was automated within a workflow constructed by means of the modeFRONTIER package.

Laccases from Didymocrea sp. (DsL) and Trichaptum abietinum (TaL) were used. These enzymes showed different pH profiles towards syringaldazine. DsL showed a maximum activity at pH 8.0 that is unusual for fungal laccases. The maximal activity of TaL was observed at pH 5.5. A kinetic mechanism for the laccase-catalyzed syringaldazine oxidation and disproportionation of reaction products as well as their reaction with NAD(P)H was suggested. Since TaL was slightly more reactive with syringaldazine than DsL, the calculated constants of enzymatic reaction were different for the investigated laccases.

LacdiNAc was confirmed to be a specific ligand for human galectin-3 contrary to human galectin-1. The compounds were tested as ligands for human galectin-3 in competitive binding assays and compared to a monovalent LacdiNAc standard. Molecular modeling was performed to calculate approximate length of respective ligands and its relation to their inhibitory capacity. The best performance was observed in symmetrical compounds carrying two LacdiNAc units connected with a hydrophobic linker of sufficient length (alkyl chain n\u00a0\u2265\u00a06).

However, their lower catalytic efficiencies and operational stabilities limit their practical and multipurpose applications in various sectors of the current industrial processes. Dependence of lignin peroxidase (LiP) on veratryl alcohol and that of manganese peroxidase (MnP) on Mn2+ is another limitation for these enzymes. Therefore to expand the range of natural industrial bio-catalysts, e.g., ligninolytic enzymes, significant progress related to the enzyme biotechnology has appeared and researchers have been re-directing their interests to immobilization engineering processes. Among the diverse immobilization techniques, the use of pre-existing supports (via covalent or physical coupling) and the immobilization without supports (enzyme cross-linked aggregates (CLEAs) or crystals (CLECs) are among the most promising. This review article mainly focuses on recent trends and valorization of immobilization and ligninolytic enzymes, i.e., LiP, MnP and laccase by industrial biotechnology.

The results show that for most of these substrates the activating EWG is the CN moiety linked to the prostereogenic olefinic carbon atom. The final stereochemical outcome can be explained through the empirical model which has been recently developed for difunctionalised alkenes activated by carbonyl/carboxyl containing EWGs.In a single case the activation is due to the COOR group linked to the less substituted olefinic carbon atom: an alternative empirical model is established for this kind of substrates, taking into consideration the OYE-catalysed reductions of \u03b2,\u03b2\u2032-disubstituted-\u03b1-monofunctionalised alkenes.",

     "abstract": "As a new type of ionic fluids that are inexpensive and environmentally friendly, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have recently attracted a broad interest in many fields including biocatalysis. In this study, 24 DESs were prepared by mixing two cholinium salts (cholinium chloride (ChCl) and cholinium acetate (ChAc)) with four H-bond donors (HBDs) (urea, glycerol, acetamide, ethylene glycol) at three molar ratios, and their effects on the activity, stability and structure of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) have been investigated. The ChCl-based DESs have been found to be superior to the ChAc-based ones in terms of promoting the HRP activity. For the DESs composed of the same salt and same HBD, an increase in the HRP activity has been observed with a higher salt/HBD molar ratio of 1:2\u00a0<\u00a01:1\u00a0<\u00a02:1. Structural studies with fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy have agreed well with the activity data, suggesting that DESs capable of providing the enzyme with a higher \u03b1-helix content and a slightly more relaxed tertiary structure may facilitate the HRP activity. All the 24 DESs were able to highly stabilize the enzyme. Addition of DESs may help to improve the HRP-mediated phenolic wastewater treatment. Our experiments have also supported the idea that the extensive H-bonding network throughout the DES is sufficiently strong to prevent the DES from dissociation in aqueous solution.",

It has been established that ultrasound had a positive effect on the activity of cellulase enzyme, though the selection of operating conditions played a crucial role in deciding the intensification. The maximum cellulase activity was observed at 17.33\u00a0W/cm2 intensity and ultrasonic treatment time of 30\u00a0min, under which the enzyme activity was increased by about 25% over the untreated enzyme. After the ultrasonic treatment, thermodynamic parameters Ea, \u0394H, \u0394S and \u0394G were reduced by 64.7%, 68%, 37.3% and 1.3%, respectively. In addition, fluorescence and CD spectra revealed that the ultrasonic treatment had increased the number of tryptophan on cellulase surface, and changed the molecular structure of cellulase enzyme favourably to provide more access to the active sites.",

To this end, a model that mimics the acyl-enzyme system was built from CALB crystallographic structure and optimized then to be used as docking target. One main orientation of the peptide within the catalytic cavity was obtained. The lysine side chain was observed to enter the cavity, placing the \u025b-amino group as to be acylated near the catalytic residues. This result was consistent with the N-acylation experimentally observed, showing the robustness of the model. Docking simulations were then applied to the peptides Lysine-Tyrosine-Serine, Serine-Tyrosine-Lysine and Leucine-Glutamine-Lysine-Tryptophan aiming to predict the selectivity of the reaction. Whatever the peptidic sequence and its constitutive amino acids, the models suggested the preferential N-acylation of the lysine side chain.

Tannases are by and large produced by microorganisms including Aspergillus, Paecilomyces, Lactobacillus and Bacillus. Tannases are generally produced on tannic carbon such as tannic acid, wheat bran, tea and coffee husk extract. Microbial tannases are mostly induced extracellular enzyme and produced by submerged fermentation and solid-state fermentation. The enzyme is most commonly purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography in addition to reverse micelle. Most tannases can act in a wide range of temperature and pH, although tannases with acidic pH optima are more common. A sequence-based classification spreads tannases in many families thus reflecting the variety of molecules. Furthermore, tannase from Lactobacillus plantarum had been characterized by three-dimensional architecture. In recent years, a novel approach, metagenomic, was developed to exploring novel tannase from natural communities.",

We previously reported a novel esterase, Est25, which was expressed in active form in Escherichia coli, and showed high hydrolyzing activities for various substrates. However, the enzyme did not show any preference for either of rac-ketoprofen ethyl ester. In this study, to improve the enantioselectivity of Est25, we used a protein engineering approach that involves building a homology model of Est25, library generation based on the model, screening for esterase activity, and screening for specificity toward (S)-ketoprofen ethyl ester. One variant, L255W was isolated showing significantly higher enantioselectivity than the wild-type enzyme. Enantioselectivity was further improved by adding one of the polar organic solvents, namely, ethanol and methanol. However, the mutant enzyme showed lower thermostability, higher sensitivity to pH, and lower resistance to polar solvents than Est25. The L255W mutation improves substrate specificity, but, at the same time, sacrifices structural stability. The approach used in this study is precise enough to engineer the substrate specificity of esterase, and general enough to be adapted to engineer other kinds of enzymes with a minimum amount of modifications.",

The whole process was fulfilled under mild conditions. Notably, gelatin played a dual function of both gelation and inducing silicification during the fabrication of composite beads. The as-prepared gelatin/silica composite beads displayed superior swelling resistance compared to pure gelatin beads and crosslinked gelatin beads. As an example, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH) was encapsulated in the composite beads during the silicification process.

Accurel MP 1000 (hydrophobic macroporous polymer of propylene) is a commercial support described as advantageous in different circumstances and it was used as comparative control in the process of immobilization.

Although Km varies \u223c1000-fold across laccases, the molecular basis of substrate binding is poorly understood. Furthermore, laccase isoenzymes vary substantially in stability and activity for unknown reasons, and are thus useful probes of stability-function trade-offs relevant to protein engineering. We report here the first systematic comparison of ABTS-binding to different proteins, i.e. the four isoforms of Trametes versicolor, using a combination of sequence clustering, density functional theory calculations, homology modeling, and multiple induced-fit docking protocols at variable pH-dependent protonation states and T1-copper oxidation state. Clustering analysis provided a systematic overview of laccases across Trametes and revealed distinct isoenzyme classes (A\u2013J) with the four T. versicolor isoforms belonging to separate classes. The T1 oxidation state had minor effect on ABTS binding, whereas the protonation state of Asp206 was important, consistent with site-directed mutagenesis studies. The absence of active poses for the \u03b4-isoform agrees with its large Km, whereas the \u03b1-isoform with the smallest Km also had most active poses with protonated Asp206 corresponding to its pHopt\u00a0\u223c\u00a02. Protonated Asp can bind to ABTS to form strong, active conformations partially explaining the low pHopt of fungal laccases toward ABTS. We identified several laccase properties optimal for ABTS binding. Notably, very high (R2\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.99) correlation was observed between log\u00a0Km (ABTS) and binding-pocket charge due to sites 157, 161, 269, 271, and 333, i.e. laccases optimal for ABTS turnover have positively charged anchor points in their pockets.

After analysis of variance test, coefficient of determination and adjusted coefficient of determination values were estimated as 0.98 and 0.94, respectively. The optimal immobilization pH, immobilization time and initial lipase concentration were determined as 6.0, 7\u00a0h and 1.1\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121, respectively, after desirability analysis. The specific activity values for three individual experiments were observed as 25.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.73, 26.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.47 and 25.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.52\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u00a0protein\u22121 under the optimized conditions. The hydrolytic activities of free and immobilized lipase preparations were characterized using p-nitrophenyl palmitate as substrate. The esterification activity of immobilized lipase preparation was evaluated by asymmetric acylation of 2-(methylamino)-1-phenylethanol, 2-(ethylamino)-1-phenylethanol, 2-(butylamino)-1-phenylethanol, and 2-(hexylamino)-1-phenylethanol with vinyl acetate. The acylation protocol was optimized in terms of the effects of initial water amount, reaction temperature, molar ratio of amino alcohol to vinyl acetate, biocatalyst loading, organic medium and kind of lipases used. The developed protocol provided a facile methodology for the preparation of enantiopure 2-amino-1-phenylethanols which may be used as potential new \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists.",

     "abstract": "Even though a lot of high pressure studies on enzyme structure, stability and activity are published in the last years, just a few works deal with the influence of pressure on the enantioselectivity of an enzymatic reaction. Furthermore, a change of the reaction medium from buffer to organic solvents for high pressure studies offers some interesting advantages, like pH independency and higher sensitivity towards hydration changes. From this point of view, in the present paper the influence of high pressure on the activity and selectivity of a Candida rugosa Lipase catalyzed reaction in organic solvents was examined. The transesterification of 1-phenylpropan-2-ol with vinyl acetate was chosen as a model reaction. The reactions carried out at 50\u00a0MPa showed an increased specific activity of the lipase, independent of solvent composition, reaction temperature and water content of the solvent. An activity maximum, without deactivation, was observed in hexane at 45\u00a0\u00b0C and 200\u00a0MPa. Between 50\u00a0MPa and 200\u00a0MPa a linear increase in the enantiomeric excess (eeR) could be detected, also independent of the solvent composition, reaction temperature and water content of the reaction medium. Furthermore, if additional water was added to the reaction solvent no change of the eeR at high pressures could be observed. This leads to the conclusion that the eeR under pressure is probably mainly influenced by the compression state of the enzyme or by structural changes of the active center rather than by the water content of the enzyme, as it is the case at ambient pressure.",

In order to improve their biotechnological applications, a deep knowledge of structural factors involved in controlling their activity, in various experimental conditions and on different substrates, is required. In the present study, a laccase from the mushroom Rigidoporus lignosus was kinetically characterized. In particular, the stability, the effects of pH, ionic strength and fluoride ion concentration on the kinetic parameters were investigated, using three di-hydroxy-benzene isomers (1,2-dihydroxy-benzene, 1,3-dihydroxy-benzene and 1,4-dihydroxy-benzene) as substrates. The catalytic constant values of the laccase showed a bell-shaped pH profile, with the same optimum pH and pKa values for all tested substrates. This behavior appears to be due to the presence of an ionizable residue in the enzyme active site. To identify this residue, the enzyme was derivatized with diethyl-pyrocarbonate to modify accessible histidine residues, which, according to structural data, are present in the active site of this enzyme. The kinetic behavior of the derivatized laccase was compared with that of the native enzyme and the derivatized residues were identified by mass spectrometry.

Using this approach, we have isolated and identified nine OSS bacteria secreting lipases that showed the same level of solvent tolerance of lipases from another 11 OST bacterial strains. Among them, two OST lipases from the OSS bacteria, Bacillus subtilis ZJU003 and Xanthomonas oryzae ZJU548, showed remarkable stability in 50% (v/v) a variety of hydrophobic organic solvents over an incubation period of 7 days. These results show that OSS microorganisms are a rich microbial resource for OST lipases that can display excellent stability in organic solvents.",

The FeTPPS/AER catalyst had a fast reaction rate for TBBPA degradation, but decolorized quickly and had no reusability. In contrast, the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst was highly durable, catalyzing the degradation of over 90% of the TBBPA and no bleaching was observed in the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst after ten recyclings. Thus, the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst can be considered to be a biomimetic model of oxidative enzymes in landfills. 4-(2-Hydroxyisopropyl)-2,6-dibromophenol (2HIP-2,6DBP) was the major oxidation product, both in the absence and presence of HA.

Major findings include the demonstration that the enzyme can accept 2-oxovalerate and 2-oxoisovalerate in addition to its natural substrate 2-oxoglutarate, and that the tested acceptors are also acceptable in the carboligation reaction, thereby very much expanding the repertory of the enzyme in chiral synthesis.",

A biocatalytic characterization of these newly discovered enzymes, expressed in recombinant forms, was carried out. Both enzymes could be purified as holo enzymes containing a FAD cofactor. Their thermostability was investigated and revealed that the Cm-BVMO is the most thermostable type I BVMO with an apparent melting temperature of 56\u00a0\u00b0C. Substrate profiling revealed that both eukaryotic BVMOs accept a wide range of ketones which include aromatic, aliphatic, aryl aliphatic and bicyclic ketones. In particular, linear aliphatic ketones (C9 and C12), carrying the keto functionality in different positions, resulted to be the best substrates in steady state kinetic analyses. In order to restore the BVMO-typifying sequence motif in the Pp-BVMO, a mutant was prepared (Y160H). Intriguingly, this mutation resulted in higher activities on most tested substrates.

In this study, we reported an improved method for the synthesis of 1-monoolein using 1,2-acetonide glycerol as starting reactant. Firstly, commercial oleic acid was purified using our previous method and then 1,2-acetonide-3-oleoylglycerol was synthesized by the esterification of 1,2-acetonide glycerol with purified oleic acid using Novozym 435 lipase as catalyst. Finally, the cleavage of unpurified 1,2-acetonide-3-oleoylglycerol in methanol was conducted to obtain 1-monoolein. The effects of reaction system, addition amount of solvent, lipase load, reaction temperature and time on 1,2-acetonide-3-oleoylglycerol content in the crude reaction mixture were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, 94.6% 1,2-acetonide-3-oleoylglycerol in crude reaction mixture was obtained. 1-Monoolein was synthesized further by cleaving unpurified 1,2-acetonide-3-oleoylglycerol in methanol at room temperature with Amberlyst-15 resin as catalyst. The cleavage reaction resulted in the formation of 76.5% 1-monoolein and 96.2% 1-monoolein was obtained at 72.8% yield after repeated recrystallization in hexane to remove nonpolar impurities and water washing to remove glycerol. The main novelties for the synthesis of 1-monoolein are the use of Novozym 435 lipase instead of chemical catalysts used in previous studies to catalyze the esterification of 1,2-acetnode glycerol with free fatty acids and scalable crystallization method used instead of column chromatography to purify 1-monoolein.",

     "abstract": "Lipase from Aspergillus oryzae (AOL) was experimentally identified to be strictly specific for mono- and diacylglycerol, but not triacylglycerol, whose substrate selectivity was considerably different from most of lipases. The mechanism of this unique feature was still not clear. To address this problem, the structure of AOL in complex with substrate analog was constructed and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to fully relax steric clashes occurring in this enzyme-substrate complex. The bound diacylglycerol analog unambiguously identified two binding pockets, into which the corresponding parts of substrate were closely fitted. Comparison of AOL with the triacylglycerol lipase in homology revealed that its substrate selectivity mainly came from its unique binding pocket: a \u201cbridge-like\u201d structure was created by two bulky residues (W89 and F257) on the top of catalytic site, which prevented substrates with large size from entering the active site. In addition, a common feature that was responsible for substrate selectivity of mono- and diacylglycerol lipases (MDGL) was drawn. A well-conserved sequence motif F-X-X-H was identified, and this consensus sequence participated in substrate recognition of these MDGLs by forming the \u201cbridge-like\u201d structure that governed the specific binding of substrate. These results could provide a guide for discovering novel MDGLs and pave the way for site-directed mutagenesis experiments to improve enzyme for applications.",

This high-throughput strategy uses a 96 well plate system, and has enabled the rapid biocatalytic screening of 256 novel bacterial isolates towards \u03b2-hydroxynitriles. Results demonstrate the strategy's potential to rapidly assess a variety of \u03b2-hydroxynitriles including aliphatic, aromatic and dinitriles.

     "abstract": "Enzymes, as natural catalysts, are prime players in the search for the new efficient environmentally friendly production of biofuels. The different permutations of the many variables, such as source, selectivity, stability and structure of substrates and enzyme, immobilization and/or life-time of the catalyst, temperature and time of the reaction and solvent constituency, polarity and quantity make the use of enzymes for this purpose a daunting task. An esterase is a unique family of enzymes that can either esterify a fatty acid in a non-polar solvent containing a stoichiometric amount of short-chain alcohol or hydrolyse an ester into the corresponding acid and alcohol. Even though tolerance of the esterase to such solvents increases the solubility of the substrates and assists in the recovery of product final product yield is controlled provided a specific amount of water is also present influencing the enzyme\u2013substrate equilibrium and the lipid\u2013water interface \u2013 an area that is occupied by the esterase. Knowing the composition of the solvent medium needed for esterase activity is complicated by knowledge of the structure of the binding pocket, substrate entry into the enzyme active channel, the flexibility of the enzyme itself, unwanted hydrolytic reactions and total changes in the thermodynamic footprint between substrate and enzyme. This article explores a computational structural analysis of an esterase investigating the substrate\u2013enzyme binding site and uses simple simulations and molecular dynamics to address the mechanism(s) and pathways that products \u2013 fatty acid esters (biodiesel) \u2013 dissociate from the enzyme. Two simulations in hexane:MeOH (9:1) and water as well as hydrogen bond interactions of the substrate/product with the enzyme, RMSD and B-factor calculations and the presence of water molecules in enzyme active binding pocket dictate which entry or exit pathway is preferable.",

The maximum half-life at a reaction temperature of 35\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 8.0 was only 5.3\u00a0h.

The amino acid sequence of NH2 terminus was determined. Nitrilase gene was cloned through CODEHOP PCR, Degenerate PCR and TAIL-PCR. The open reading frame consisted of 1113\u00a0bp encoding a protein of 370 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence showed the highest identity (61.6%) to nitrilase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1. The enzyme was highly specific toward aromatic nitriles such as 3-cyanopyridine, 4-cyanopyridine, and 2-chloro-4-cyanopyridine. It was classified as aromatic nitrilase. The nitrilase activity could reach up to 71.8\u00a0U/mg with 3-cyanopyridine as substrate, which was a prominent level among identified cyanopyridine converting enzymes. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax for 3-cyanopyridine were 27.9\u00a0mM and 84.0\u00a0U/mg, respectively.

In the present study, a high-redox potential laccase is proposed as an alternative system for the biotransformation of selected NSAIDs: naproxen (NPX) and diclofenac (DCF). The effects of pH and the use of synthetic and natural mediators (1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) and syringaldehyde (SA), respectively) were evaluated with the aim of optimizing the removal of NSAIDs by laccase. Results proved high removal yields for NPX (70\u201394%) after 24\u00a0h in the presence of HBT at acidic and neutral pH, while DCF was completely transformed at pH 4 within shorter periods, from 30\u00a0min to 4\u00a0h, both in the absence or presence of mediators. The operation at a higher pH implied the addition of mediators to remove DCF, with values of 50 and 98% for SA and HBT, respectively. Kinetic parameters of the transformation reactions and laccase inactivation were estimated and compared for the different experimental conditions. Besides, the identification of the major biotransformation products of DCF was attempted: decarboxylated compounds were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and corresponding reaction pathways were proposed. Moreover, laccase-catalyzed treatment was demonstrated to significantly improve the aerobic biodegradability of the medium containing DCF in comparison with untreated solution, suggesting that DCF transformation products are less toxic than the parent compound.",

Temperature dependent circular dichroism and steady state fluorescence studies of LipR3 and LipR1 lipase supported the observation that LipR3 is more thermostable than LipR1. Structural analysis of the homology model of LipR3 showed that the Arg 214 was substituted with Cys at a large surface loop which connects lid helix (\u03b16) to another helix (\u03b17). The hydrophobic residues of the loop (Val 197, Tyr 204 and Phe 206) formed a compact hydrophobic region with residues from lid helix.

Phylogenetic analysis of the protein showed it was a new member of family VI lipolytic enzymes. Biochemical characterization analysis showed that PE8 preferred short chain p-nitrophenyl esters (C2\u2013C6), exhibited maximum activity toward p-nitrophenyl acetate, and was not a metalloenzyme. PE8 was an alkaline esterase with an optimal pH of 9.5 and an optimal temperature of 45\u00a0\u00b0C toward p-nitrophenyl acetate. Furthermore, it was found that PE8 exhibited activity and enantioselectivity in the synthesis of methyl (R)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)glutarate ((R)-3-MFG) from the prochiral dimethyl 3-(4-fluorophenyl)glutarate (3-DFG).

However, esterification of the free hydroxyl function of the lactate esters was much more enantioselective, with an opposite preference toward the d form. Among the 200 combinations screened (substrates and lipases), only two reactions fulfilled the required criteria for an efficient resolution (fast reaction, enantioselectivity ratio higher than 100).

In the present study, the role played by aromatic residues present in the aglycone binding subsite of BhXyl39 in the hydrolysis and transglycosylation reactions of the enzyme was investigated. In this way, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out in order to highlight the role of three targeted hydrophobic residues F116, F167 and Y284. These residues were replaced by alanine to decrease the steric hindrance or were mutated into serine to evaluate the impact of the presence of a polar residue into the aglycone binding subsite of BhXyl39. Taking into account kinetic parameters and yields of transglycosylation, the function of each mutated residue in the catalytic mechanism was studied. Results concerning transglycosylation reactions in the presence of pentan-1-ol and octan-1-ol indicated that yields of transglycosylation were impacted both by the position and the nature of the mutated residues. These results were consistent with molecular docking performed with both acceptors which notably confirms that among the three targeted residues, F116 represents the most interesting one for mutagenesis to increase the transglycosylation reactions in presence of long chain alcohols.",

Optimization of the reaction conditions have shown that the highest production (80% in 30\u00a0min) could be achieved at 40\u00a0\u00b0C, in microemulsions with relatively low water content (wo\u00a0=\u00a08). Kinetic studies have shown that the esterification reaction of stearic acid with solketal catalyzed by CaL B occurs via the ordered bi\u2013bi mechanism, in which inhibition by the acid was identified. Moreover, at high fixed solketal concentrations a negative cooperativity is pronounced, which means that binding of the alcohol lowers the affinity of the enzyme for binding of the acid. Values of all kinetic parameters have been determined.",

A SlPXG gene was cloned from tomato, heterologously expressed in yeast and the membrane bound recombinant SlPXG protein was used as enzyme source. Unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives, and terpenes were epoxidized by SlPXG in the presence of various hydroperoxides exclusively at their cis-double bonds. Terpenes with p-menthene skeleton were transformed in different ways depending on their molecular structures. R-(+)- and S-(\u2212)-limonene were converted to R-(+)-limonene-trans-1,2-epoxide (97%) and cis-S-(\u2212)-limonene-1,2-epoxide (88%), respectively whereas \u03b1-terpinene was hydroxylated to cis-1,4-dihydroxy-p-menth-2-ene and \u03b3-terpinene was aromatized to p-cymene. In the last reaction the hydroperoxide served as hydrogen acceptor rather than an oxygen donor. PXG appears to be a versatile biocatalyst able to perform different kinds of oxidation reactions.

Knowing how specificity is controlled, would allow to optimise this activity in an efficient way by means of enzyme engineering. Therefore, in this study, a map of the acceptor site of the SP from Bifidobacterium adolescentis was created by substituting each residue by alanine and analysing the influence on the affinity for both the natural (inorganic phosphate and fructose) and alternative acceptors (d-arabitol and pyridoxine). All residues examined were found to contribute to the specificity for phosphate (Arg135, Leu343, Tyr344), fructose (Tyr132, Asp342) or both (Pro134, Tyr196, His234, Gln345). Alternative acceptors that are glycosylated rather efficiently (e.g. d-arabitol) were found to interact with the same residues as fructose, whereas poor acceptors like pyridoxine do not seem to make any specific interactions with the enzyme. Furthermore, it is shown here that SP is already optimised to outcompete water as an acceptor substrate, meaning that it will be very difficult to lower its hydrolytic activity any further. Consequently, increasing the transglycosylation activity towards alternative acceptors seems to be the best strategy, although that would probably require a drastic remodelling of the acceptor site in most cases.",

One of these genes, designated as estWSD, consisted of 1152 nucleotides, encoding a 383-amino-acid protein.

The best substrate for the purified EstWSD among the \u03c1-nitrophenol esters examined was \u03c1-nitrophenol butyrate.

Analysis of the tertiary structures showed that three essential domains of the enzyme including super secondary structure (\u03b1\u03b2)8, the barrel region, and the large cleft remained native in Amyl-S1 and Amyl-S2. Secondary structures of Met112-Val118, Gly202-His211, Gln230-Asp233, Phe292-Asp297 residues in Amyl-C, Amyl-S1, and Amyl-S2 remained unchanged.

Flexibility analysis of the three forms was examined and it is obtained that by truncation, the flexibility of the C-terminal domain was increased.

This mechanism has been exploited to combine the selectivity of metal chelate affinity chromatography with the covalent immobilization capacity of epoxy supports. In this way, it has been possible to accomplish, in a simple manner, the purification, immobilization, and stabilization of a histidine-tagged recombinant benzaldehyde lyase. To fulfill this objective we prepared and characterized a multifunctional Co2+-IDA-epoxy functionalized the silica coated magnetic nanoparticles (SCMPs) which are modified with glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA).To test immobilized BAL, benzoin condensation reaction was performed with this magnetically responsive biocatalyst. The results obtained from the carboligation reaction that was performed with this simple and convenient heterogeneous biocatalyst were comparable to that of free-enzyme-catalyzed reaction.Additional advantages are its reusability and it is easy to work with.",

In this study both free cells and macerated mycelia immobilised in calcium alginate were utilised and the results (products, % yields, % transformation) were compared. In general the encapsulated cells of the microorganisms effectively generated products similar to those found using free cells. However, with immobilised macerated mycelia, isolation of the transformation products was expedited by the simple work up procedure, and their purification was facilitated by the absence of fungal secondary metabolites.

We performed acylation experiments on three amino-alcohols (alaninol, 4-amino-1-pentanol and 6-amino-1-hexanol) using myristic acid as an acyl donor. Two organic solvents (tert-amyl alcohol and n-hexane) and one ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate: Bmim [PF6]) were used to determine the effect of the solvent. The influence of the amino-alcohol carbon chain length between the alcohol and amino groups on chemoselectivity C (kcat,app O-acylation/kcat,app N-acylation) was highlighted. N-acylation is improved using alaninol, a short chain amino-alcohol (no mono-O-acylation in tert-amyl alcohol and C\u00a0=\u00a00.12 in n-hexane) whereas O-acylation is improved using 4-amino-1-pentanol and 6-amino-1-hexanol which are amino-alcohols with longer chain (C\u00a0=\u00a010.5 in tert-amyl alcohol and C\u00a0=\u00a0539 in n-hexane).

The biocatalysts showed different optimal conditions for the production of FAME. For CALB-435, optima conditions were 5.6:1 molar ratio methanol:oil, 25% enzyme, and 5.44% of added water, while for MCI\u2013CALB, these optima were 3:1 molar ratio methanol:oil, 25% enzyme, and 1.18% of added water, resulting in initial reaction rates of 51.47\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121, and 57\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 of FAME, respectively.

Acid hydrolysis, followed by oxidation with sodium periodate, was applied to modify Immobead 150 by exchanging its epoxy groups to aldehyde in its surface. Immobilization occurred between the introduced aldehyde groups on the support and the primary amino groups from the lysines on the enzyme surface. These biocatalysts were characterized using the techniques of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Thermogravimetry (DTG) and used for the transesterification reaction of soybean oil. The immobilization was highly efficient, 96.30% and 99.08% for CALB and RML, respectively, with yields of 86.68% to CALB and 94.21% to RML. Analysis of the enzymatic transesterification reaction between soybean oil and methanol showed that the CALB preparation presented higher yield (72%) of fatty acid methyl ester than RML (29%) in 4\u00a0h.

The findings revealed that the three glucose isomerases displayed different behaviors in particular in terms of thermoactivity, stability at high temperature and specific activity. The thermoactivity/thermostablity and specific activity of r-SKGI were lower than those of native SKGI. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed that native and r-SKGI showed different molecular weights. This could be attributed to the presence of 8% O-glycosylation in the SKGI monomers, which entailed a potential attachment of sugar residues having a total mass of about 3.44\u00a0kDa on Thr at positions 6 and/or 30. The results also demonstrated that the His-tagged SKGI was less thermoactive/thermostable than SKGI and r-SKGI. Electrophoretic analysis showed that the His tag significantly affected the dimerization of SKGI. A 3D model of His6-SKGI was constructed. The results showed that the Histidine attachment was located at the dimerization interface and that, unlike the rest of this interface, it was hydrophilic in nature, which presumably hamper the dimerization process and led to the decrease in thermoactivity/thermostablity and catalytic efficiency.",

We constructed Escherichia coli cells that expressed P450cam and its redox partners, putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase, and cells that co-expressed this P450cam multicomponent system with a glucose dehydrogenase (Gdh) to regenerate NADH using glucose. Two types of cells \u2013 wet cells that did not receive any treatment after washing with glycerol-containing buffer, and freeze-dried cells that were lyophilized after the washing \u2013 were prepared as whole-cell catalysts. When wet cells were reacted with 2-adamantanone, E. coli cells expressing only the P450cam multicomponent system efficiently produced 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone in the presence of glucose. However, the co-expression of this P450cam system with Gdh did not further enhance the amount of this product. These results indicate that enough amounts of NADH for P450cam catalysis would be supplied by endogenous glucose metabolism in the E. coli host. In contrast, when freeze-dried cells were used, only the cells co-expressing the P450cam multicomponent system with Gdh efficiently catalyzed the oxidation in the presence of glucose. These results suggest that the exogenous Gdh compensated loss of NADH regeneration by the endogenous glucose metabolism that would be damaged by the lyophilization process. Furthermore, we attempted to produce 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone with repeated additions of the substrate using wet cells expressing only the P450cam multicomponent system and freeze-dried cells co-expressing this P450cam system with Gdh.

The effects of the monosaccharides were concentration dependent, where in a stimulatory range (0.1\u201350\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121), the activity increased up to 2-fold; in a stimulatory-inhibitory range (50\u2013450\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121 glucose or 50\u2013730\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121 xylose), the enzyme continued to be stimulated, but the activity was lower than maximal.

Dynamic light scattering confirmed that the enzyme is monomeric (54\u00a0kDa) and kinetic, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission and far ultraviolet circular dichroism analyses indicated that the enzyme possesses a catalytic site (CS) and a modulator binding site (MS). Glucose or xylose binding to the MS induces conformational changes that stimulate the catalytic activity at the CS. Glucose and xylose may compete with the substrate for the CS while the substrate competes with the monosaccharides for binding to the MS. The stimulation of the enzymatic activity by glucose and xylose, which compete for the same sites on the enzyme molecule, is not synergistic. These data reveal allosteric interactions between the MS and the CS in H. insolens \u03b2-glucosidase that result in fine modulation of the catalytic activity by the monosaccharides.

The present study suggests MNPs negatively charged by docusate sodium salt (AOT) as a support for pectinase immobilization. AOT is a biocompatible anionic surfactant which can stabilize MNPs. Electrostatic adsorption can occur between enzyme with positive charge and oppositely charged surface of MNPs (ca. 100\u00a0nm). The effect of three factors, i.e. initial enzyme concentration, aqueous pH and AOT concentration in different levels was investigated on pectinase immobilization. Maximum specific activity (1.98\u00a0U/mg\u00a0enzyme) of immobilized pectinase and maximum enzyme loading of 610.5\u00a0mg\u00a0enzyme/g\u00a0support was attained through the experiments. Initial enzyme concentration is significantly important on both loading and activity of immobilized enzyme, while pH and AOT concentration only affect the amount of immobilized enzyme. Immobilized enzyme on MNPs was recovered easily through magnetic separation. At near pH of immobilization, protein leakage in reusability of immobilized enzyme was low and activity loss was only 10\u201320% after six cycles. Since pH is associated with immobilization by electrostatic adsorption, the medium pH was changed to improve the release of protein from the support, as well.

In reverse micelles, Km values decreased 2\u20137 fold relatively to the free biocatalyst using as substrates acetamide, acrylamide, propionamide and glycinamide ethyl ester. We have concluded that overall the affinity of the biocatalyst to each substrate increases when reactions are performed in the reversed micellar system as opposed to the buffer system. The immobilized biocatalyst in general, exhibits higher stability and faster rates of reactions at lower substrates concentration relatively to the free form, which is advantageous. Additionally, the immobilization revealed to be suitable for obtaining the highest yields of hydroxamic acids derivatives, in some cases higher than 80%.",

Bioinformatics analysis of the protein sequence indicated that there were two hydrophilic and two hydrophobic amino acid clusters in an alternate arrangement at the N-terminus, and 50 extra amino acid residues at the N-terminus were not present in the known maleate cis\u2013trans isomerases. The alternate hydrophilic and hydrophobic clusters at the N-terminus were thus truncated one by one to evaluate their effect on the gene expression and enzyme activity. Three mutants (MaiR-D41/42-304AA, MaiR-D48/49-304AA and MaiR-D52/53-304AA) without the hydrophilic and hydrophobic clusters were expressed as soluble protein with maleate cis\u2013trans isomerase activity.

     "abstract": "The purpose of the present investigation was to study the pH dependence of both the immobilization process and the enzyme activity of a feruloyl esterase (FoFaeC from Fusarium oxysporum) immobilized in mesoporous silica. This was done by interpreting experimental results with theoretical molecular modeling of the enzyme structure. Modeling of the 3D structure of the enzyme together with calculations of the electrostatic surface potential showed that changes in the electrostatic potential of the protein surface were correlated with the pH dependence of the immobilization process. High immobilization yields were associated with an increase in pH. The transesterification activity of both immobilized and free enzyme was studied at different values of pH and the optimal pH of the immobilized enzyme was found to be one unit lower than that for the free enzyme. The surface charge distribution around the binding pocket was identified as being a crucial factor for the accessibility of the active site of the immobilized enzyme, indicating that the orientation of the enzyme inside the pores is pH dependent. Interestingly, it was observed that the immobilization pH affects the specific activity, irrespective of the changes in reaction pH. This was identified as a pH memory effect for the immobilized enzyme. On the other hand, a change in product selectivity of the immobilized enzyme was also observed when the transesterification reaction was run in MOPS buffer instead of citrate phosphate buffer. Molecular docking studies revealed that the MOPS buffer molecule can bind to the enzyme binding pocket, and can therefore be assumed to modulate the product selectivity of the immobilized enzyme toward transesterification.",

A detailed hydrogen bond analysis confirms previously implicated residues in the active site (Asp217, Asp222, Trp226, Asp229 and Glu488) and quantifies the importance of individual residues for the binding. The most important amino acids are Asp229 and Phe339 which are involved in many interactions during the simulations. While Phe339 was observed in more simulations, Asp229 was involved in more persistent interactions (forming an average of at least 2 hydrogen bonds during the simulation).

     "abstract": "The behavior of two yeast strains has been studied under different conditions. Both microorganims catalyzed the aldol reaction between activated aldehydes and acetone when a large amount of the latter was present in the reaction medium producing, with moderate stereoselectivity, the aldol product with the R configuration. No reduction of any of the products present in the medium was detected. On the other hand, the carbonyl group of the racemic aldol was reduced to produce chiral 1,3-dialcohol derivatives when water was employed as the only solvent. In this case, the resolution of the racemic starting material was also possible with one of the biocatalysts, and the aldol was recovered with the S configuration. A complementary enantioselectivity was shown by both microorganisms in the generation of the new stereogenic center, which allowed access to 3 of the 4 possible diastereomeric diols with high enantiomerical purity.",

Analysis of these data, taking into account chemical shifts of the carbon atom supporting the hydroxyl or amino group, (\u03b4) and \u03c3 p + , enables a mechanism to be proposed for the transformation of o-diphenols, o-aminophenols and o-phenylendiamines into their products (o-quinones, o-quinoneimine and o-diimine), and, at the same time, for the suicide inactivation.The reaction constants in the representations of log k cat X / k cat H vs. \u03c3 p + according to Hammett's equation for the three types of substrate (o-diphenols, o-aminophenols and o-phenylendiamines) confirm that the catalysis mechanism is similar (simultaneous oxidation/reduction process on the two copper atoms). The dependence of log \u03bb max X / \u03bb max H vs. \u03c3 p + for the three substrate types reflects a lower reaction constant (in absolute value), which might indicate a similar reaction mechanism for the different molecules, but different from the previous mechanism, in that the oxidation/reduction only involves one copper atom.We also discuss the proposed mechanism and compare it with those described by other authors. Knowledge and quantification of the catalysis/inactivation process of tyrosinase might be of interest for optimizing applications such as wastewater treatment.",

Previously, two distal histidines were introduced in the heme pocket of myoglobin (Mb) at positions 29 and 43. The resultant His29 and His43, together with the native His64, formed a metal-binding site in the designed L29H/F43H Mb mutant, which closely mimics the heterobinuclear center of native cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). Instead of studying the oxidase activity, we herein investigated the cross-reactivity, i.e., the peroxidase activity of this mutant, as well as the effect of metal ions binding to the designed metal-binding site on protein reactivity. It was found that the introduced two distal histidines with no bound metal ion serve to improve the peroxidase activity of L29H/F43H Mb compared with that of WT Mb containing a single distal histidine, whereas the binding of metal ions such as Cu(II) and Zn(II) to L29H/F43H Mb inhibits the catalytic activity to a different extent. These findings provide valuable insights into the peroxidase activity observed for the native CcO, as well as the role of metal ion in fine-tuning the protein cross-reactivity.",

Homology models of Kau2 were built; we selected one of them and used it as a guide for saturation mutagenesis experiments targeted at specific residues within the large substrate binding pocket. During the molecular evolution process, we found several enzyme variants with higher enantioselectivity or enhanced enantioconvergence toward para-Chlorostyrene oxide. Improved enantioselectivities by up to a factor of 5, reaching an E-value of up to 130 with the R-enantiomer as the residual epoxide, were achieved by replacing amino acid pairs at the positions 110 and 113, or 290 and 291, which are positions located in the vicinity of two presumed binding sites for the epoxide enantiomers. The (R)-para-Chlorophenylethane-1,2-diol product exhibited a high enantiomeric excess (ee) of 97% at 50% conversion of the racemic epoxide for the most enantioselective variant. Further, five amino acid substitutions were sufficient to substantially increase the degree of enantioconvergence and to lower the E-value to 17 for the final evolved EH variant, enabling the production of the R-diol with an ee-value of 93% at 28\u00a0\u00b0C in a complete conversion of the racemic epoxide. Higher eep-values of up to 97% were determined in enantioconvergent reactions using lower temperatures. The EH activities of whole cells were found to be within the range of 74\u2013125% of the wild-type activity for all investigated variants. We show in this report that the metagenome-derived Kau2 EH is amenable to the redesign of its enantioselectivity and regioselectivity properties by directed evolution using a homology model as a guide. The generated enzyme variants should be useful for the production of the chiral building blocks (R)-para-Chlorostyrene oxide and (R)-para-Chlorophenylethane-1,2-diol.",

The activity of immobilized lipases was found to depend upon the size of the PEI polymers and the way of GA treatment, with best results obtained for covalent-bind enzyme on glutaraldehyde activated PEI-PUF (MW 70,000\u00a0Da), which was 1.7 time greater activity compared to the same enzyme immobilized without PEI and GA. Kinetic analysis shows the hydrolytic activity of both free and immobilized lipases on triolein substrate can be described by Michaelis\u2013Menten model. The Km for the immobilized and free lipases on PEI-coated PUF was 58.9 and 9.73\u00a0mM, respectively. The Vmax values of free and immobilized enzymes on PEI-coated PUF were calculated as 102 and 48.6\u00a0U/mg enzyme, respectively. Thermal stability for the immobilization preparations was enhanced compared with that for free preparations. At 50\u00a0\u00b0C, the free enzyme lost most of its initial activity after a 30\u00a0min of heat treatment, while the immobilized enzymes showed significant resistance to thermal inactivation (retaining about 70% of its initial activity). Finally, the immobilized lipase was used for the production of lauryl laurate in hexane medium. Lipase immobilization on the PEI support exhibited a significantly improved operational stability in esterification system. After re-use in 30 successive batches, a high ester yield (88%) was maintained. These results indicate that PEI, a polymeric bed, could not only bridge support and immobilized enzymes but also create a favorable micro-environment for lipase.

     "abstract": "Free lipase-mediated alcoholysis offers an effective alternative approach to biodiesel production due to its merits of faster reaction rate and lower preparation cost. Further promoting the application of free lipase in catalyzing the transesterification of crude renewable oils is of significance since the cost of oil feedstock accounts for a major part in biodiesel production. Crude renewable oils typically contain a certain amount of phospholipids and it has been found that the phospholipids have inhibitory effect on lipase's catalytic performance during immobilized lipase-catalyzed biodiesel production. However, the influence of phospholipids on free lipase-mediated alcoholysis in oil/water biphasic system has not been reported. In this work, free lipase from Aspergillus niger was employed as the catalyst for biodiesel production and the effect of phospholipids on free lipase's catalytic performance was explored for the first time. It was found that both the reaction rate and the final FAME content increased and the free lipase exhibited better reuse stability in the presence of phospholipids. Further study on the distribution of phosphorous showed that within 2% phospholipids contained in the oil feedstock, only less than 4\u00a0ppm phosphorous remained in the final methyl esters, which well met the phosphorous demand of biodiesel standard. The above results demonstrated that free lipase-mediated alcoholysis was promising for biodiesel production especially with low quality crude vegetable oils as the feedstock.",

It was also evaluated that in case of adsorption size of nanoparticles did not influence enantioselectivity, but in case of covalent binding small nanoparticles gave much better results than big ones.",

The purified recombinant enzyme (TreS-T.C) could catalyze the reversible interconversion of maltose and trehalose of sucrose into trehalulose without other disaccharides including isomaltulose at an optimum temperature of 35\u00a0\u00b0C and a pH of 6.5. The Km of TreS-T.C for maltose (96\u00a0mM) was lower than those for trehalose (198\u00a0mM) and sucrose (164\u00a0mM), suggesting that maltose is the optimum substrate.

Homology modeling analysis revealed that TreS-T.C had a GH13-typical (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 barrel catalytic domain. Two sites, one determining substrate specificity (L116) and the other affecting product formation (E330), were found near the active center by homology modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis. TreS-T.C may be used effectively as a potential biocatalyst for the production of trehalose and trehalulose from maltose and sucrose in a one-step reaction, respectively. This study also provides a feasible and effective method for studying functional amino acid residues around TreS without performing crystal structure analysis and high-throughput screening.",

The purification profile of peroxidase on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis had shown two protein bands corresponding to two isoenzymes (TCWP1 and TCWP2) with a molecular weight of \u223c47 and 49\u00a0kDa respectively. The purified isoenzymes TCWP1 and TCWP2 exhibited its maximal activity (3.5 and 3.2\u00a0U/ml; respectively) at pH 4.5 and 5.0 with o-Dianisidine dihydrochloride (o-D) as substrate at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. TCWP1 and TCWP2 isoenzymes were stable up to 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. The stability of the enzyme at increased temperature may be attributed to the presence of Ca2+ ions to the enzyme. Addition of excess Ca2+ ions to the enzyme mixture enhanced the stability further to 55\u00a0\u00b0C for both the isoenzymes. The excess addition of H2O2 inhibited the peroxidase activity and the TCWP isoenzymes were stable up to 10\u00a0mM of H2O2 concentration at 25\u00a0\u00b0C.

We discuss a simple route to overcome the geometric disadvantage imposed by most 2D immobilization supports and make them capable of closely mimicking free enzymes (FE) operating under similar reaction conditions. The supramolecular assembly of oppositely charged quenched polyelectrolytes and maghemite\u2013magnetite nanoparticles on 2D graphene supports followed by covalent immobilization of cellulase shows a marked improvement in the bio-receptivity of graphene supports. The incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles opens up the possibility of recovery and reuse of the enzyme over multiple cycles. The immobilized enzymes retained about 55% of the original specific activity even after four cycles of reuse. Cellulase immobilization is achieved by a combination of annealed polyelectrolyte brushes and zero-length spacer molecules. The swelling behavior of annealed polyelectrolyte brushes is a strong function of the environmental conditions. The degree of polyelectrolyte swelling can be easily tweaked by manipulating the pH and temperature, providing us an effective tool to control the activity of immobilized enzymes. At a pH of 5.1 and a temperature of 50\u00a0\u00b0C, the immobilized enzymes with the annealed polyelectrolyte brushes displayed close to 1.5-fold improvement in the activity as compared to immobilized enzymes without the brushes. Activity of immobilized cellulase is evaluated using both soluble as well as insoluble substrates like 2% (w/v) CMC and avicel respectively.",

In order to overcome these limitations, a novel electroenzymatic system using tyrosinase/carbon nanopowder/polypyrrole composite as a working cathode was reported with the outstanding conversion rate up to 95.9%. However, the productivity was still limited due to a low solubility of the substrate l-tyrosine in aqueous phase. Herein, we demonstrated a novel strategy for enhancing the productivity by employing well-dispersed l-tyrosine as the substrate. When using well-dispersed l-tyrosine, not only the concentration of the substrate was increased to 90.6\u00a0gL\u22121 in aqueous phase but also the productivity was enhanced up to 15.3\u00a0gL\u22121\u00a0h\u22121.

Increased formation of diaminated products occurred in PcL-mediated reactions and generally when the amine was supplied in excess. Diamination entailed elimination of the benzoquinone methoxy group (amination in para-position to the first amine substituent). Six products were synthesised and characterised by NMR and HR-MS analysis.

The maximum BD yield with PDA-6 WCL reached 95.3% after 40\u00a0h at a lipase load 10% (w/w) of PO and methanol to PO molar ratio 5:1. The immobilization of PDA-6 cells within biomass suspended particle (BSP) made of polyurethane foam improved the repeated use of WCL and the remaining activity after 10 cycles was 88.2%. The PDA-6 WCL was more active in methanolysis of PO to BD than most WCLs previously reported. The newly isolated A. nomius is not only potential for producing WCL but also utilizing waste cooking oil.",

     "abstract": "The escalation in genome sequencing has presented a mass of potentially useful new alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in the form of putative open reading frame (ORF). To take advantage of such available resources, PCR primers based on the genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis were used to clone a gene encoding a hypothetical alcohol dehydrogenase (named as BtADH). Activity studies of the translation product revealed that the alcohol dehydrogenases catalyse the inter-conversion of aliphatic aldehydes and corresponding primary alcohol with chain length of two to ten carbons. The required co-factor for such inter-conversion was found to be NAD(H). The ADH gene was engineered for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme was produced in a soluble form. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and physical, spectral and catalytical properties were determined.The findings lead us to propose that BtADH represents a novel primary\u2013secondary alcohol dehydrogenase that acts on primary alcohols of medium chain lengths and simple ketones. Besides, BtADH shares high sequence similarity with well known ADHs from thermophilic origins. Such biochemical characterisation of BtADH provides valuable information for the study of sequence\u2013function relationship including source of thermal stability, cofactor and substrate preferences.",

Through performance evaluation of the immobilization based on its yield and efficiency, an adequate combination of the immobilization conditions to obtain optimum values in these parameters were determined as enzyme loading of 60:1 (weight ratio of enzyme carrier to enzyme) in an immobilization buffer of 500\u00a0mM at pH 8.5 for 24\u00a0h.

The development of an enzyme-based sensor employing the enzyme ChOx has great potential as a simple and economical sensor system. However, an electron mediator-type electrochemical monitoring system based on oxidases is inherently affected by dissolved oxygen. Therefore, oxidases that are less O2-sensitive would be very advantageous for the development of amperometric enzyme sensors using artificial electron acceptors. In this study, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis on oxygen-binding residues, which are observed in the high-resolution crystal structure, in order to elucidate the amino acid residues responsible for the oxidase activity. First, Ala substitutions were carried out. Among the 6 Ala-substituted ChOxs, along with saturation mutagenesis, Val191Ala showed a significant decrease in its oxidase activity, but showed increased dehydrogenase activity. The dehydrogenase/oxidase ratio of Val191Ala was more than 150%, which was a 400-fold increase compared with the ratio for the wild-type enzyme.

A key issue for catalytic applications of isolated P450s is the demand for a continuous electron supply to the heme-group. Mediator driven bioelectrocatalysis can help to overcome this problem.For mediator driven bioelectrocatalysis the identification of a suitable mediator is crucial for the fast development of an efficient electro enzymatic process. To this end we have developed a computational screening method based on using freely available software. Calculated electron transfer rates were compared with measured product formation rates.

A three-step method, including acryloylation, polymerization with acrylamide and sequential polymerization with N-isopropylacrylamide, was established to fabricate enzyme nanogel with temperature-sensitive interpenetrating polymer network. It has been shown by an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation that above mentioned polymer matrix forms a more hydrophobic environment, as compared to that obtained with sole polyacrylamide, because of the penetration of N-isopropylacrylamide into the polymer acrylamide network via hydrogen bonding, which is further confirmed by the fluorescence spectrum. This favours the uptake of hydrophobic substrates and thus the overall rate of enzymatic catalysis. The enhanced stability and catalytic performance of this novel lipase nanogel in aqueous and non-polar organic solvent were demonstrated by using hydrolysis reaction of p-NPP in aqueous and esterification reaction of ibuprofen in isooctane. In aqueous solution, the residual activity of CRL-IPN nanogel maintains its 70% activity at 60\u00a0\u00b0C after 4\u00a0h, compared with that free lipase only has 30% at the same condition.

In isooctane, CRL-IPN nanogel gave a 33% yield of esterification of ibuprofen, in comparison to 22% using free lipase and less than 5% using lipase encapsulated in a polyacrylamide matrix.

Lipase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of pentadecalactone (\u03c9-PDL) dispersed in water was used as a model reaction to understand the synthetic activity of lipases in biphasic o/w system. We conducted a systematic investigation of the influence of reaction conditions on the macromolecular characteristics of oligo(\u03c9-PDL) encompassing chemical, thermophysical and colloidal properties of the reaction medium. A model was proposed assuming Michaelis\u2013Menten interfacial kinetics followed by chain extension via lipase-catalyzed linear polycondensation. The solidification of oligo(\u03c9-PDL) chains with a degree of polymerization of approximately three was identified as a major factor limiting the molecular weight of obtained oligomers to \u223c870\u00a0g\u00a0mol\u22121, despite the fast reaction rate and complete conversion of \u03c9-PDL. The addition of toluene into the dispersed phase at a volumetric ratio of 0.3\u20130.5 of toluene to \u03c9-PDL allowed us to circumvent this problem and increase the molecular weight of obtained oligomers up to 1460\u00a0g\u00a0mol\u22121. The molecular weight of polymer product according to this model was thus inversely related to the weight ratio percentage of interfacial lipase PS to \u03c9-PDL per droplet and correspondingly correlated with the activity of lipase.

After purified by Bio-Gel P-2 size exclusion column chromatography, the main products were determined by MS and NMR analysis to be maltosyl-, maltotriosyl-, maltotretraosyl- and maltopentaosyl-fructosides (G2F, G3F, G4F and G5F, respectively, where G\u00a0=\u00a0glucosyl unit and F\u00a0=\u00a0fructose) with an \u03b1-1,4 linkage between the added glucosyl unit and the sucrose. The low cariogenic property of these maltooligosylsucrose products was confirmed by analyzing the effect on the synthesis of water insoluble glucan, acid fermentation, plaque formation and cell aggregation of Streptococcus mutans when compared to those exerted by sucrose. Moreover, by adding sucrose to maltooligosylsucrose products at ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4, the inhibitory effects on glucosyltransferase activity of S. mutans by 7, 33 and 50%, respectively, were observed. These results suggest that the obtained maltooligosylsucrose products have an anticariogenic property and could be used to substitute for sucrose in food or related products.",

All A. niger EH preparations catalyzed preferentially hydrolysis of (R)-epoxides. Although enantiomeric excess values of all the tested epoxides were 99%, the highest enantiopure epoxide yields were obtained as 48% for (S)-styrene oxide by the immobilized EHs onto modified Florisil\u00ae and Eupergit\u00ae C. The highest diol yield was obtained as 78% for 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol, however, its enantiomeric excess value was 28.2%. Enantioselectivity of A. niger EH was improved with the preparation of mentioned immobilized forms. The highest enantioselectivity value was obtained as 95 toward styrene oxide by A. niger EH immobilized onto modified Florisil\u00ae.

Although there is a general agreement that the microenvironment mechanism is the dominant model for the color determination of firefly luciferase, a complete mechanism has not been shown, partially due to the lack of comprehensive data on which amino acid positions alter the bioluminescent color. In this paper, a mutant library of position serine 286 (S286) in Luciola cruciata luciferase (LUC-G) was constructed and characterized. The substitution of S286 resulted in a drastic red shift in bioluminescence color (>600\u00a0nm), and only glycine (G) and alanine (A) mutants remained yellow-green. To explain this color difference, molecular dynamics (MD) calculations of 3 S286 derivatives (S286G, S286N, and S286I), in addition to wild type (WT), were performed. The active site rigidity and active site hydrogen bonding networks were compared to WT for each derivative.

In this study, we describe the enzymatic synthesis of O-aryl \u03b1-glycosides catalyzed by \u03b1-thioglycoligases. An \u03b1-xylosidase mutant (YicI-D482A) efficiently catalyzed the synthesis of O-aryl \u03b1-xylosides in near-quantitative yields (up to 99%) using 4-methylumbelliferone and nitrophenols. Synthesis did not occur with those acceptors having a nitro group at the ortho-position. The conversion yields of 3-nitrophenol markedly increased at pH 8.0, whereas those of other aryl compounds were nearly independent of pH, ranging from pH 6.0 to 8.0. The O-aryl \u03b1-xylosides were prepared on a preparative scale with yields of up to 96%. Upon employing the O-aryl \u03b1-xylosides as the substrate for the wild-type YicI, Br\u00f8nsted relationships of log kcat versus pKa and log (kcat/KM) versus pKa both showed a linear monotonic dependence on the leaving group pKa with low \u03b2lg values of 0.39 and 0.38, respectively. In addition, synthesis of O-aryl \u03b1-glucosides was successfully conducted by an \u03b1-glucosidase mutant (MalA-D416A) in the same fashion with high yields. Therefore, this strategy can be used for the synthesis of O-aryl \u03b1-glycosides using an acid/base mutant of retaining \u03b1-glycosidases that hydrolyze the glycosides.",

For this purpose, different types of ATPS were prepared and the partition coefficient of pure commercial laccase was determined in each one, at 23\u00a0\u00b0C. A total of 21 ATPS were investigated: 12 composed by a polymer and a salt and 9 composed by two different polymers. For polymer\u2013salt ATPS, different compositions of the same biphasic system were also studied. Laccase partition coefficients (K) obtained were used to conclude about ATPS effectiveness for this enzyme recovery. According to the results, it was found that UCON-phosphate salts (K\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.604), PEG-Li2SO4 (K\u00a0=\u00a02.081) and PES-dextran (K\u00a0=\u00a01.911) ATPS can be interesting options for laccase extraction, with laccase partitioning toward opposite directions. However, the most effective ATPS for laccase extraction was UCON-K2HPO4, presenting K values from 0.272 up to 0.306. UCON is a thermo-separating polymer which facilitates its recovery and reutilization. Additionally, for the first time, laccase stability in different ATPS was investigated by incubating the enzyme in each equilibrium phase during a week, at room temperature. The results obtained showed that UCON-sulfate salts, UCON-NaH2PO4 and UCON-KH2PO4 ATPS are not recommended for laccase recovery since a high loss of activity was observed: approximately 88% for sulphates and 80% for both dihydrogen phosphates. The best stability results were obtained with PEG-sulfate salts. For these ATPS, laccase stability remained similar or improved over time.",

Immobilized enzyme (on octyl Sepharose or Eupergit C) has been used, to take advantage of the solid phase. Modification of immobilized CALB's native amino groups did not produce a significant alteration of CALB. However, if the enzyme was previously aminated, around 14\u201315 PEG molecules could be introduced per enzyme molecule. Also, it has been found that succinic groups are far more reactive than acetic acid following this strategy.Even after this drastic double modification, the functional properties of the enzyme have not been impoverished to a large extent: stability decreased only to some extent (by a 5\u20136 fold factor), activity versus some substrates even increased (e.g., around 60% using p-nitrophenyl butyrate). It has been found that both modifications (amination and pegylation) have very different effects on enzyme properties when performed on CALB immobilized on Eupergit C or octyl Sepharose. For example, activity versus pNPP increased using CALB-octyl Sepharose while it decreased when using Eupergit C following amination and PEGylation. The effects also depend on the reaction and substrate, for example in hydrolysis of methyl mandelate, the activity decreased by 50% using CALB-octyl Sepharose after PEGylation of the aminated enzyme, while using CALB-Eupergit C had no effect. In this last case, enantioselecitvity in this hydrolysis significantly improved after both chemical modifications (from 7.5 to 20), while using CALB-octyl Sepharose almost had no effect.",

     "abstract": "After purification from the crude commercial preparation, the 3D structure of the synthetically valuable lipase from Pseudomonas stutzeri (LipC) is described through homology modelling, leading to a rational explanation of its catalytic behaviour. This elucidates that the enzyme has an active site defined by residues Ser-109, His-277 and Asp-255, and an oxyanion hole formed by peptidic NH groups from Met-43 and His-110. Interestingly, the active site is covered by two lids, one of them (Lid1, residues 145\u2013181) being larger than the other (Lid2, residues 233\u2013253). The opening and closing of these lids have been simulated by molecular modelling assuming both water and pure THF as solvents. Accordingly, THF clearly helps the exposure of the catalytic serine to the reaction medium which explains its excellent reported performance in this organic solvent. On the other hand, the stereospecificity of this enzyme is explained considering a small hydrophobic cavity formed by Gly-45, Phe-46, Tyr-54, Trp-55, Leu-278, Val-281 and Phe-284; particularly, Tyr-54 plays an important role in substrate recognition. In fact, in benzoin acylation, this residue forces the benzoyl group of the substrate to go into that cavity via H bonding with the carbonyl O atom of benzoin, thereby explaining the observed S-preference in benzoin acylation, which apparently contradicts the canonical Kazlauskas\u2019 rule. For other alcohols non possessing the \u03b1-hydroxycarbonyl core, Tyr-54 is allowing the entrance into the above-mentioned hydrophobic cavity only to those substrates with no steric hindrance in the vicinity of the hydroxymethane moiety.",

Kinetic parameters, pH and temperature optima of the pure recombinant enzyme were determined using linoleic acid as the substrate. Km, vmax, and kcat were 40.3\u00a0\u03bcM, 130.3\u00a0U mg\u22121, and 157\u00a0s\u22121, respectively. The maximal enzymatic activity was found at pH 7.0 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C. Showing high specificity toward free linoleic acid, the enzyme was classified as lipoxygenase type 1. Conversion of linoleic acid yielded mainly (S)-13-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (94% ee), as was confirmed by chiral HPLC analysis of the hydroperoxides. The amino acid sequence showed homology to lipoxygenases catalyzing S stereospecific oxygenation, and thus the enzyme was characterized as a 13S-lipoxygenase. This is the first lipoxygenase described to accept terpene hydrocarbons as substrates.",

     "abstract": "Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (PCL) was immobilized onto polyurethane copolymers containing \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) via physisorption. The polymer bound PCL was characterized using an equilibrium sorption method, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR), Raman spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The objective of this research was to investigate lipase immobilization onto polyurethane copolymers and an investigation of its enzymatic activity. The copolymers contain \u03b2-CD with two types of crosslinker units: 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate (CDI) and 4,4\u2032-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), respectively. Immobilization of PCL resulted in a pronounced increase in catalytic activity and stability of lipase (\u223cthree-fold for CDI and \u223cfour-fold for MDI) in comparison with free lipase in aqueous solution. PCL exhibited remarkable hydrolytic activity over a range of pH (5\u20139) values, temperatures (25\u201365\u00a0\u00b0C), and solvents (mostly non-polar). The immobilized lipase was further used for the synthesis of n-butyl octanoate ester using n-butanol and octanoic acid. The immobilized lipase was successfully recycled four times while maintaining \u223c75\u201380% esterification activity after the fourth catalytic cycle and exhibited appreciable stability for at least 30 days.",

This coupling was catalyzed by Alcalase covalently immobilized onto macroporous acrylic beads; these immobilized enzymes were hydrated prior to use. Near-anhydrous conditions (i.e. extremely low water activity) were maintained by a carefully chosen amount of molecular sieve powder. Kinetic characteristics were determined from reaction time courses up to full conversion at various initial concentrations of substrate and product. These progress curve data were fitted with different kinetic models to determine which of these models best approximates the kinetic properties of the immobilized Alcalase with respect to the coupling under study. An appropriate model of the coupling reaction is necessary in order to design a reactor and predict its performance adequately leading to the practical implementation of biocatalyic peptide synthesis. The kinetics of the coupling were found to be complex and to obey a two-substrate kinetic model with two competitive product inhibition terms. To reduce the effect of the product inhibition on immobilized Alcalase, a reactor should be designed in which at least glycolamide is selectively removed as this was found to be the strongest inhibitor.",

These new enzyme variants (\u03d5-BTL2) maintained the catalytic properties of the native enzyme. The \u03d5-BTL2 was immobilized by different orientation on disulfide support at pH 7 via disulfide-exchange and additionally rigidification was introduced by the immobilization on disulfide-aldehyde support through the interaction of the reactive amino groups on the protein near to the position of the introduced cysteine with aldehydes on the support.The oriented immobilization of the \u03d5-BTL2-S334C variant on disulfide-aldehyde supports generated a fully enantioselective biocatalyst (ee\u00a0>\u00a099%) in the kinetic resolution of rac-2-O-butyryl-2-phenylacetic acid and the asymmetric hydrolysis of phenylglutaric acid dimethyl diester. The simple orientation by the introduced cysteine on the lipase immobilization on disulfide supports was enough for good selectivity (ee\u00a0>\u00a099%) in the asymmetric hydrolysis but not in the kinetic resolution (ee\u00a0=\u00a027%).The rigidification of the oriented immobilized Q40C, T94C or S334C variants on disulfide-aldehyde support was key in the lipase selectivity improvement in the kinetic resolution process (ee from 27\u201350 to >99%). In this case, the oriented immobilization did not alter significantly the selectivity. A similar result was obtained for S196C variants in the asymmetric hydrolysis, which it selectivity was greatly altered depending on the immobilization method, no selectivity was observed after immobilization on disulfide support but a fully selective catalyst (ee\u00a0>\u00a099%) was achieved after immobilization on heterofunctional disulfide-aldehyde support.",

While this step allowed for the recovery of unreacted, optically pure (3S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylnonae-2,4-dione, the corresponding (3R)-enantiomer was obtained by subsequent TEMPO-mediated oxidation of the syn diol intermediate. Moreover, using the title compounds as analytical standards, predominance of the (3R) enantiomer in the natural flavor compound was finally demonstrated by chiral GC\u2013MS analysis.",

     "abstract": "We have designed a kinetic model of biodiesel production using Novozym 435 (Nz435) with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a catalyst. The scheme assumed reversibility of all reaction steps and imitated phase effects by introducing various molecular species of water and methanol. The global model was assembled from separate reaction blocks analyzed independently. Computer simulations helped to explore behavior of the reaction system under different conditions. It was found that methanolysis of refined oil by CALB is slow, because triglycerides (T) are the least reactive substrates. Conversion to 95% requires 1.5\u20136 days of incubation depending on the temperature, enzyme concentration, glycerol inhibition, etc. Other substrates, free fatty acids (F), diglycerides (D) and monoglycerides (M), are utilized much faster (1\u20132\u00a0h). This means that waste oil is a better feedstock for CALB. Residual enzymatic activity in biodiesel of standard quality causes increase of D above its specification level because of the reaction 2M\u00a0\u2194\u00a0D\u00a0+\u00a0G. Filtration or alkaline treatment of the product prior to storage resolves this problem. The optimal field of Nz435 application appears to be decrease of F, M, D in waste oil before the conventional alkaline conversion. Up to 30-fold reduction of F-content can be achieved in 1\u20132\u00a0h, and the residual enzyme (if any) does not survive the following alkaline treatment.",

     "abstract": "Some ionic liquids are able to dissolve wood, including lignin and lignocellulose, and thus they provide an efficient reaction media for modification of globally abundant wood-based polymers. Lignin can be modified with laccases (EC 1.10.3.2), multicopper oxidases, which selectively catalyze the oxidation of phenolic hydroxyl to the phenoxy radical in lignin by using oxygen as the co-substrate and an electron acceptor. Many enzymes, including laccases, retain their catalytic activity in the presence of ionic liquids. However, the enzyme activity is usually decreased in the presence of ionic liquids, and the most deactivating ionic liquids have been observed to be those dissolving wood most efficiently. In the present study the activity, pH optimum and catalyzed oxidation of coniferyl alcohol by the laccase from the ascomycete Melanocarpus albomyces was investigated in the ionic liquid 1-allyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride ([Amim]Cl), known to dissolve wood and expected to affect the laccase activity. Indeed, with an increasing concentration of [Amim]Cl, the activity of M. albomyces laccase decreased, and the pH range of the enzyme activity was narrowed. The pH optimum, using 2,6-dimethoxyphenol as the substrate, was shifted from 6.5 to 6.0 when the amount of [Amim]Cl was increased to 60% (m-%). It was also found that the inhibition of laccase with NaN3 was not as severe in the ionic liquid as in water. The insoluble fraction of the dehydropolymer (DHP) formed in the presence of [Amim]Cl had clearly higher molecular weight compared to the one formed in water. DHPs formed in the absence and presence of [Amim]Cl both contained \u03b2-5, \u03b2\u2013\u03b2, \u03b2-O-4, \u03b1-CO/\u03b2-O-4 and \u03b1-O-4/\u03b2-O-4 structures.

The current work describes the different behavior shown by Candida antarctica lipase B (Novozym 435) when catalyzing the O-acylation and N-acylation of bifunctional acyl acceptors. The acylation of three amino-alcohols (alaninol, 4-amino-1-pentanol and 6-amino-1-hexanol) was studied using myristic acid as an acyl donor. To achieve this, a structure-reactivity study was performed in tert-amyl alcohol as a solvent, comparing the three amino-alcohols as acyl acceptors and a series of structurally related amines, namely (R)-sec-butylamine, 1-methoxy-2-propylamine and 1,2-diaminopropane. These substrates were designed to investigate the effect of the group located in \u03b2-position of the amino group on the acyl acceptor: the more nucleophilic the group, the more the apparent maximal velocity (Vmax,app) of N-acylation increases. Moreover, the crucial role of the carbon chain length between the alcohol and amino groups on the chemoselectivity was also demonstrated. The chemoselectivity for the N-acylation was improved when the carbon chain included two carbons (alaninol) whereas the chemoselectivity for the O-acylation was improved when the carbon chain included four carbons or more (4-amino-1-pentanol and 6-amino-1-hexanol).These results provided new insights for the selective synthesis of amides or esters produced from the acylation of bifunctional substrates.",

     "abstract": "A gene encoding acidic, thermostable and raw starch hydrolysing \u03b1-amylase was cloned from an extreme thermophile Geobacillus thermoleovorans and expressed. The ORF of 1650\u00a0bp encodes a 515 amino acid protein (Gt-amy) with a signal peptide of 34 amino acids at the N-terminus. Seven conserved sequences of GH-13 family have been found in its sequence. The specific enzyme activity of recombinant Gt-amy is 1723\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u22121 protein with a molecular mass of 59\u00a0kDa. It is optimally active at pH 5.0 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C with t1/2 values of 283, 184 and 56\u00a0min at 70, 80 and 90\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The activation energy required for its temperature deactivation is 84.96\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121. Ca2+ strongly inhibits Gt-amy at 10\u00a0mM concentration, and inhibition kinetics with Ca2+ reveals that inhibition occurs as a result of binding to a lower affinity secondary Ca2+ binding site in the active centre in a mixed-type inhibition manner. The Km and kcat of the Gt-amy are 0.315\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121 and 2.62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0s\u22121, respectively. Gt-amy is Ca2+-independent at the concentration used in industrial starch saccharification, and hydrolyses raw corn and wheat starches efficiently, and thus, is applicable in starch saccharification at the industrial sub-gelatinization temperatures.",

     "abstract": "The methyltransferase NovO cloned from Streptomyces spheroides could be heterologously produced as soluble and active enzyme in Escherichia coli. Sequencing of the cloned novO gene revealed differences to the GenBank entry AAF67508.1 resulting in a different amino acid at position 223 (Cys instead of Ser). A generated variant containing a Ser residue at this position, however, resulted in poor ability to express soluble and enzymatically active protein. Characterization of NovO revealed a type I methyltransferase that performs its action as a dimer in solution. Functional elements include the conserved S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) binding site (consensus: E/DXXXGXG) as DLCCGSG (residues 45\u201351). Mutation analyses of the respective amino acids verified their importance for cofactor binding and enzyme activity.

Yeast reductase YDL124W has been shown to convert ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxo butanoate (ECOB) into (S)-ECHB in an enantioselective manner. In that reduction, YDL124W absolutely prefers NADPH as a cofactor to NADH. NADPH is, however, much more expensive and unstable than NADH. In this study, four amino acid residues that directly interact with the 2\u2032-phosphate group of adenosine ribose of NADPH were identified based on the homology model and docking model of YDL124W with ECOB and NADPH. Among various single mutants altered in these target residues, R264H evidenced noticeably increased reductase activity with NADH. The double mutant, R264H/R27Y, had more profoundly enhanced reductase activity with NADH. Kinetic analysis results demonstrated that these mutants had reduced Km values toward NADH and increased kcat/Km values in comparison with the wild-type. Computer modeling showed that no hydrogen bond could be formed between the wild-type and 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of adenosine ribose of the NADH cofactor, whereas three hydrogen bonds and one \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction could be formed between R264H or R264H/R27Y mutants and the NADH cofactor.

Kinetic parameters for the phosphorolysis of natural substrates were determined for GtPyNP at 60\u00a0\u00b0C (Km for uridine 2.3\u00a0mM, Km for thymidine 1.3\u00a0mM) and TtPyNP at 80\u00a0\u00b0C (Km for uridine 0.15\u00a0mM, Km for thymidine 0.43\u00a0mM). The kcat values for uridine are almost identical for both enzymes (ca. 277\u00a0s\u22121), while the kcat value for thymidine is about 8 times higher for TtPyNP than for GtPyNP (679\u00a0s\u22121 vs. 83\u00a0s\u22121).Both enzymes were tested towards the ability to catalyze the phosphorolytic cleavage of 2\u2032-fluorosubstituted pyrimidine nucleosides \u2013 a prerequisite for the efficient synthesis of a number of relevant purine nucleoside analogues. GtPyNP showed poor activity towards 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluorouridine (dUrd2\u2032F; 0.4% substrate conversion after 30\u00a0min), and the phosphorolysis of the epimeric counterpart 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-\u03b2-d-arabinofuranosyl)uracil (dUrd2\u2032F) could not be detected at all. By contrast, TtPyNP showed dramatically higher conversion rates (15.6% and 1.6% conversion in 30\u00a0min of both substrates, respectively). The amount of converted pyrimidine nucleosides increased significantly with time. After 17\u00a0h 65% of dUrd2\u2032F and 46% of dUrd2\u2032F was phosphorolytically cleaved.Our results demonstrate the potential of TtPyNP as a biocatalyst in transglycosylation reactions aiming at the production of 2\u2032-fluorosubstituted purine nucleosides that are highly bioactive but hardly accessible by chemical methods.",

Because of its ability to hydrolyse soluble and insoluble substrates and the lack of a classical interfacial activation it was previously characterized as an intermediate between a lipase and an esterase. We show by molecular dynamics simulation in full atomistic detail that CALB attaches and binds to a hydrophobic tributyrin\u2013water interface via three hydrophobic anchor regions defined by Leu 147, Leu 219, and Val 272 surrounding the entrance to the active site. These regions trigger the reorientation of the protein via hydrophobic interactions even when the protein impacts at the surface in a non-optimal orientation. During the binding process the flexible helix \u03b15 undergoes a movement of 7.5\u00a0\u00c5 towards the substrate layer. Though tributyrin has no net charge a long-range attraction between interface and protein was observed up to a separation of 7\u00a0\u00c5 that corresponds to the amplitude of the fluctuations of the tributyrin surface. A stable binding of the protein with the active site oriented towards the active site was observed for several hundreds of nanoseconds in total. During that time, single tributyrin molecules moved from the tributyrin layer into the substrate binding site of CALB and were temporarily binding as productive sn3-complexes.",

Results show that the leaving alkoxy group influences the enantiomeric ratio of the reaction. Resolution of pentan-2-ol with methyl propanoate gives an enantiomeric ratio of 62. Esters with longer linear alkyl chains, from ethyl to pentyl propanoate give higher enantiomeric ratios, comprised between 103 and 117. Enantiopure ester (R)-1-methylpentyl propanoate increases the enantiomeric ratio to 140 compared with E\u00a0=\u00a0120 for the racemic mixture. In contrast, enantiopure (S)-1-methylpentyl propanoate decreases the enantiomeric ratio to 72. Our data support the notion of an imprinting effect or \u201cligand-induced enzyme memory\u201d caused by the shape of the leaving alcohol.To simulate the imprinting effect caused by the alkoxy part of the acyl donor, molecular modeling studies were performed with both (R)- and (S)-enantiopure 1-methylpentyl propanoate. To investigate how the first step of the reaction, through the first tetrahedral intermediate, affects the enzyme conformation depending on the enantiopure ester substrate used, 20\u00a0ns molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. Clustering analysis was done to study relevant conformations of the systems. Differences in the global conformation of the enzyme between systems with R or S enantiomers were not observed. Interestingly however, orientation of the partially buried side chain for Ile285 was affected.

Biochemical characterization of ZmoSHC1 uncovered unique substrate activity patterns compared to the previously reported AacSHC from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius and ZmoSHC2, the second squalene-hopene cyclase from Z. mobilis. ZmoSHC1 showed cyclization of the non-natural substrates homofarnesol (C16) and citronellal (C10) in addition to hopene formation from squalene (C30). Moreover, ZmoSHC1 turned out to reveal high biocatalytic stability during long-term incubations. Remarkably, ZmoSHC1 exhibited a shift of activity towards substrates of shorter chain lengths, displaying over 50-fold higher conversion of homofarnesol and more than 2-fold higher conversion of citronellal in comparison to squalene conversion.",

Following a 190-fold improvement in the enzyme activity by protein engineering means, improving the process conditions of this biocatalytic route was under taken for developing a liter-scale bioprocess. The growth stage was improved by selection of a rich media and harvesting the cells at the end of the logarithmic stage. The biotransformation stage was optimized by evaluating substrate concentration, cell density, and different operational modes. It was found that although reusing the cells in successive batch modes is feasible, their activity is dramatically decreased after the first use. In comparison, the activity of the cells following subsequent substrate addition in a fed batch mode was only slightly decreased. Furthermore, a better yield was obtained by extending the duration of the biotransformation stage, rather than adding more substrate. An overall concentration of 133\u00a0mg/L HTyr, corresponding to a volumetric productivity of 54\u00a0mg/L/h and a yield of 48% was achieved by a batch mode using 2\u00a0mM substrate. This is an order of magnitude improvement compared with the enzyme productivity before the process optimization. The use of beads conjugated with phenylboronic acid residues for adsorbing the product from the biotransformation bulk was evaluated. Though the recovery yield and purity were shown to be oppositely dependent, an average recovery procedure led to 2-fold purification of HTyr resulting in 84% purity with 70% recovery yield.",

The central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the effects of the PA concentration (PAC) and lipase concentration (LC) as well as the agitation speed (AS) on the BY of phenolic lipids. The initial findings indicated that the stationary point was a saddle point. To overcome this saddle point, sequential experiments have been carried out at fixed PAC, with LC and AS as the two independent variables. For the models with PAC, fixed at 10 and 20\u00a0mM, the results revealed that LC had a significant quadratic effect (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) on the %BY, whereas a significant linear effect was only obtained at PAC fixed at 20\u00a0mM. The AS had a significant quadratic effect (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) on the %BY only for the model with PAC fixed at 10\u00a0mM. At fixed PAC of 20\u00a0mM, the response surface model predicted a BY of 75%, using a LC of 62\u00a0mg/mL and an AS of 154\u00a0rpm. The subsequent verification experiment carried out under these conditions confirmed the validity of the prediction.",

Glycerol can produce a functionalized polymer through a polycondensation process. Enzymatic polycondensation of glycerol and divinylesters was studied and xanthorrhizol was covalently loaded via a butanedioate linker to the polymer backbone. It was observed that xanthorrhizol loading to the polymer backbone increases with the increasing of the chain length of a dioate moiety. Enzyme-mediated xanthorrhizol release from a polymer backbone shows that the polymeric prodrug is able to release xanthorrhizol in a sustained manner. Therefore, the approach described here might be valuable for controlled loading and release of such phenolic sesquiterpenes from the polymeric prodrug.",

The enzyme immobilization yield was 66%, and the high level of phenol removal activity was preserved during this process (91% of enzyme activity was retained). The Michaelis\u2013Menten model parameters for the immobilized HRP were somewhat different from those for free HRP (\u03bdmax\u00a0=\u00a07.83\u00a0mM/min and KM\u00a0=\u00a08.41\u00a0mM for free HRP and \u03bdmax\u00a0=\u00a04.29\u00a0mM/min and KM\u00a0=\u00a012.96\u00a0mM for immobilized HRP).

Comparison of the best conditions for the immobilization process at 25\u00a0\u00b0C showed that Eupergit C and C 250\u00a0L require milder conditions than Sepabeads EP (e.g. lower ionic strength and pH, shorter incubation time) to achieve immobilized activity yields over 90%.Seeking to increase the thermostability of the derivatives, the effects of two post-immobilization treatments were studied: alkaline incubation to favor the formation of additional covalent linkages, and blocking of excess oxirane groups by reacting with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol or glycine. The blocking process improved the thermal stability of all derivatives, with glycine having a greater effect than \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Thermal stability further improved when an alkaline incubation was performed before blocking. The stabilization achieved by this combined strategy was more effective for Eupergit-based than for Sepabeads EP derivatives, and was higher at medium applied load (30\u00a0mg/g of gel). Thus, stabilized biocatalysts obtained at medium load on Eupergit C and C 250\u00a0L showed half-lives 10-fold higher than similar Sepabeads derivatives (387, 385 and 37\u00a0h, respectively).These improved biocatalysts were used batchwise and in continuous processes for lactose hydrolysis in cheese wheys.

Recent progress in nanotechnology leads research interests toward the immobilized enzyme on/into nanoscale support material.

The isotherm curve fitted for Langmuir model indicated that high loading densities were based on the monolayer coverage of full surface, not multi-layer aggregation.

The low reaction rate registered in this reaction was investigated in terms of the effect of the alcohol on the physicochemical\u2013enzymatic stability of the biocatalyst and the interaction of the substrates with the catalytic triad at a molecular level.The effect of contacting 2-propanol:H2O mixture on Novozym\u00ae 435 was investigated at 45\u00a0\u00b0C for an extended period of time (8 days). The mixture dissolves the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) that constitutes the support of the Candida antarctica B lipase (CALB). Additionally, the alcohol diffuses into the biocatalyst's beads remaining strongly adsorbed (the alcohol desorption is evidenced only upon heating at 187\u00a0\u00b0C) and altering the inner texture of the biocatalyst's beads. Additionally, 2-propanol modifies the secondary structure of the enzyme by decreasing the \u03b2-sheet contribution and increasing the \u03b2-turn structure. The molecular modeling of the interaction of R/S-ketoprofen and 2-propanol with the catalytic triad of the lipase provides evidences that the secondary alcohol exerts an important steric hindrance for the reaction to proceed.",

We have performed, then, a comparative study on the biochemical properties of the two enzymes. Due to the insertion of 4Ile at the N-terminus of Staphylococcus simulans lipase (SSL), some important differences in the biochemical properties between r-SSL and 4Ile-SSL have been found. We can essentially notice that, when using short chain triacylglycerols (tributyrin) as substrate, the insertion of four Isoleucines residues (4Ile) was accompanied by an increase in the specific activity (3 fold) as well as in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM app.) (2 fold), as compared to the recombinant SSL.

The predominant metabolism of the incubated 5-ene steroids (10 and 14) occurred through 3\u03b2-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase/5,4-en isomerase pathways resulting in the generation of a 4-en-3-oxo system on ring-A.

Here, it has been demonstrated that several species of the Aspergillus genus are able to perform chemo- and stereoselective oxidation of organic sulfides. Two substrates were chosen as models, the aliphatic cyclohexyl(methyl)sulfide and the alkyl aryl sulfide, thioanisole. All the tested strains showed the ability to oxidize cyclohexyl(methyl)sulfide, whereas most of them oxidized thioanisole. In all cases R-stereoselectivity was observed and full chemoselectivity was verified since no sulfone was detected. Several biotransformation parameters such as the employment of growing or resting cell, different head-space volumes, age of the cultures, bio-reaction times and biocatalyst/substrate ratios resulted crucial in the optimization of the processes. Thus, when using isopropyl alcohol as co-solvent in growing cell systems, chemo- and stereoselectivity could be modulated. Among the studied strains, Aspergillus japonicus ICFC 744/11 was found to be a promising whole cell biocatalyst to prepare enantioenriched sulfoxides since after optimization, either conversion and optical purity of (R)-cyclohexyl(methyl)sulfoxide were excellent (c: 100%, ee\u00a0>\u00a099%).",

The core magnetic material (\u03b3-Fe2O3) in the support induced an easy recovery of the catalyst by the use of a magnetic field.

The Zn(II)-His complex was characterized by elemental analysis, Ultraviolet\u2013visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis DRS), and FTIR spectroscopic methods. The catalytic performances of the CA and zinc complex were studied for para-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA) hydrolysis by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy.

The studied enzymes were four carboxylesterases: PsyHSL (psychrophilic), Aes (mesophilic), EST2 (thermophilic) and AFEST (hyperthermophilic). The effect of the solvents on catalytic activity was measured by adding solvents up to 20% (v/v) to the assay mixture. For all enzymes at low solvent concentrations (4\u20135%) the catalytic activity (U/mg) increased up to 3\u20134-fold; only diethyl ether exerted a negative effect when compared to the reference value without solvent. EST2 and AFEST retained more than 100% of activity for concentrations of solvent >10% (v/v). Similar results were obtained for the stability analysis; in fact these two enzymes appeared more stable than the mesophilic and psychrophilic counterparts.The kinetic parameters of PsyHSL, EST2 and AFEST in all the tested solvents showed an increase in kcat but a negative effect on KM values. In the case of PsyHSL the KM increase was very low resulting in a substantial increase of the specific constant (S); in particular, the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide increased the kcat and the s values about 4- and 3-fold, respectively. We tested the ability of the enzymes to synthesize esters with the aim to discriminate if the decrease of activity in the presence of organic solvents was due to protein denaturation or an inversion of the hydrolytic reaction toward synthesis. While for PsyHSL and Aes the synthesis was very low and completely abolished in presence of solvents, instead for EST2 and AFEST the esters synthesis increased up to 10-fold in the presence of solvents, although the hydrolytic activity dropped about 300-fold.",

Contrary to the hydrolytic activity, the kinetic of the transfructosylation activity of LS was best fitted to the Hill model with low Hill coefficients (nH, 0.74), indicating the negative binding cooperativity of substrates.

A shift of the transfructosylation reaction further towards the polymerization side was observed in the presence of raffinose as a fructosyl donor as compared to sucrose. The acceptor specificity studies reveal the ability of LS to synthesize a variety of hetero-fructooligosaccharides from various saccharides as fructosyl acceptors. Disaccharides were more favourable fructosyl acceptors as compared to monsaccharides. Contrary to disaccharides acceptor reactions, LS-catalyzed transfructosylation of monosaccharides did not yield a quasi equilibrium state. Contrary to lactose, galactose, xylose and glucose acceptor reactions, a lower accumulation of levan was detected in the presence of maltose.

We followed directly and quantitatively the formation and decomposition of an enzyme-substrate (ES) complex as frequency changes (mass changes) on the QCM plate. It has been predicted from X-ray crystallography of SBA that two carboxyl groups, Glu186 and Glu380, are the crucial residues for the catalytic hydrolysis of \u03b1-1,4-glycoside linkage, and the side chain Thr342 on the inner loop structure bends the glycoside at subsites \u22121 and +1 of the substrate, thereby accelerating the hydrolysis. When SBA wild-type (WT) was employed, the frequency increased (mass decreased) simply because of the hydrolysis of the substrate on the QCM plate. When T342S and T342A mutants having small side chains with no hydrogen bond on the inner loop were employed, the frequency change showed a sigmoidal curve pointing to an increase in ES complex formation and hydrolysis of the substrate. When E186A and E380A mutants were employed, the frequency decreases (mass increases) showed only enzyme binding to the substrate ES complex formation, but not hydrolysis. From curve fitting of these different patterns of frequency changes, we obtained all kinetic parameters for each step of the enzyme binding to the substrate (kon), the enzyme release from the ES complex (koff), and the catalytic rate constant (kcat) for WT and mutants. From the frequency change patterns of the substrate-immobilized QCM we evaluated how mutations of the enzyme affect kon, koff, and kcat values for ES complex formation and decomposition.

The interest in exploiting recombinant enzymes as biocatalysts is constantly increasing nowadays. The plausible advantages involved with their use include their (1) rigidity and permeability, (2) hydrophobic/hydrophilic character, (3) ease of purification and large-scale production, (4) immediate separation from the reaction mixture after completion of reaction without using any chemicals or heating, (5) regenerability as they impart stability to enzymes by protecting their active sites from deactivation, and (6) recombinant enzymes can be conveniently tailored within utility limits. \u03b2-Galactosidase is one of the relatively few enzymes that have been used in large-scale processes to perform lactose hydrolysis and galacto-oligosaccharide production.

Maximum conversion of 47.74% with enantiometric excess of substrate (ees) of 90.05% and enantiomeric ratio (E) of 433.39 was obtained in 3\u00a0h using 30\u00a0mg of enzyme loading with equi-molar ratio of alcohol to ester at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. From the progress curve analysis, the ping\u2013pong bi\u2013bi mechanism with inhibition by both substrates was found to fit the initial rates. Kinetic parameters were obtained by using non-linear regression. The process is efficient and easily scalable as compared to the chemical process.",

Here, we determined the reactivities of E- and Z-farnesyl diphosphate synthases (E- and Z-FPP synthases) isolated from Bacillus stearothermophilus and Thermobifida fusca, respectively. For this purpose we use the synthetic substrate analogs, 8-tetrahydropyran-2-yloxy-, 8-hydroxy- and 8-acetoxygeranyl diphosphates. Z-FPP synthase catalyzed the reaction between 8-hydroxygeranyl diphosphate (HOGPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which produced (2Z)-12-hydroxyfarnesyl diphosphate (yield: 16.7%) and (2Z, 6Z)-16-hydroxygeranylgeranyl diphosphate (yield: 6.6%). Neither E- nor Z-farnesyl diphosphate synthases detectably catalyzed reactions between 8-tetrahydropyran-2-yloxygeranyl diphosphate (8-THPOGPP) and IPP. However, a mutated E-FPP synthase (Y81S), did catalyze this reaction, producing 12-tetrahydropyran-2-yloxyfarnesyl diphosphate (12-THPOFPP) with a yield of 12.3%. Wild-type E-FPP synthase catalyzed the reaction of 8-acetoxygeranyl diphosphate (8-AcOGPP) with IPP, which produced 12-acetoxyfarnesyl diphosphate (12-AcOFPP) (yield, 21.8%). Mutant E-FPP synthase catalyzed the reaction between 8-AcOGPP with IPP, producing 12-AcOFPP and 16-acetoxygeranylgeranyl diphosphate (16-AcOGGPP) with respective yields of 55.3% and 1.7%.

In the present study, chemical modification of HRP was carried out using citraconic anhydride and trimellitic anhydride introducing one and two carboxylic groups respectively, per each amino group. As is well known, chemical modification provides a rapid and inexpensive method to stabilize enzymes. Thermoinactivation, kinetic parameters and activation energy of catalysis and structural changes of HRP were studied using spectroscopic techniques. The results indicated that both modifiers stabilized HRP in the range of 50\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C but citraconic anhydride was the only stabilizer at higher temperatures. Structural study implied that HRP became less compact upon modification. In addition, catalytic efficiency and activation energy did not change remarkably following reaction of the enzyme with carboxylic anhydrides. We concluded that the effect of chemical modification with carboxylic anhydrides on the thermal stability depends on temperature condition probably, due to a competition between hydrophilization of the protein surface and repulsion of the negative charges occurring following modification.",

Thermo-gravimetric analysis showed the supports to be stable <250\u00a0\u00b0C. Both wt and N221S/P342L were covalently bound to oxirane-groups respectively via glutaraldehyde spacers, and for coupling reactions 26 Lys and 20 Ser/Thr were surface-located.

To purify the extracellular enzyme responsible for transglycosylation, a four-step protocol was adopted and the enzyme with electrophoretical purity was obtained. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of 210\u00a0kDa and displays a narrow hydrolysis specificity towards \u03b1-1,4-glucosidic bond. Its hydrolytic activity was identified as decreasing in the order of maltotriose\u00a0>\u00a0panose\u00a0>\u00a0maltose. Only 3.61% maltose activity occurs when p-nitrophenyl \u03b1-d-glycopyranoside serves as a substrate, suggesting that this enzyme belongs to the type II \u03b1-glucosidase. In addition, the enzyme was able to transfer glucosyl groups from the donors containing \u03b1-1,4-glucosidic bond specific to glucosides, xylosides and alkyl alcohols in \u03b1-1,4- or \u03b1-1,6-manners. A decreased order of activity was observed when maltose, maltotriose, panose, \u03b2-cyclodextrin and soluble starch served as glycosyl donors, respectively. When maltose was utilized as a donor and a series of p-nitrophenyl-glycosides as acceptors, the glucosidase was capable of transferring glucosyl groups to p-nitrophenyl-glucosides and p-nitrophenyl-xylosides in \u03b1-1,4- or \u03b1-1,6-manners. The yields of p-nitrophenyl-oligosaccharides could reach 42\u201360% in 2\u00a0h.

Hydration prior to drying (with anhydrous tert-butanol and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran) of the Alcalase formulations resulted in a significant increase in rate of the subsequent dipeptide synthesis. Repeated use, in the presence of molecular sieves, without intermediate rehydration led to inactivation of the enzyme. For three enzyme formulations this inactivation could be counteracted by intermediate rehydration. Inactivation of another enzyme formulation was only partially reversible by hydration. Alcalase immobilized onto dicalite with glutaraldehyde was found to be the most active in dipeptide synthesis, i.e. the formulation that initially produces the largest amount of product per gram of total formulation per unit of time. Due to its small particle size and its lack of operational stability, this formulation may nevertheless not be the best choice for the synthesis of dipeptides in neat organic media on a large scale. The most promising enzyme formulation for this is Alcalase covalently immobilized onto macroporous acrylic beads due to its reasonable activity, its seemingly good operational stability, and its size and uniform shape.",

Enhanced by 20% stain removal was achieved with the photozyme containing protease formulations as a result of improved enzyme performance along with anti-redeposition effect. Light irradiation of stained fabrics in presence of the photozyme brought about 37% higher cleaning degree compared to the samples irradiated without photozyme. Fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were used to confirm the self-assembling behavior of the photozymes in aqueous solutions, their interaction with the protease and the generation of singlet oxygen, thus elucidating the rationale behind the boosted cleaning performance of photozyme containing bio-based formulations.",

More recently, the endogenous AARS has been reported to recognize the close structural analogs of its cognate amino acid and helps in the in vitro and in vivo incorporation of analogs into recombinant proteins. By exploiting this substrate promiscuity, a number of non-canonical amino acids were successfully incorporated into the recombinant proteins. However, the incorporation efficiency varies with the different structural analogs depending on their reactivity towards the tRNA synthetases, which is due to the interaction and accommodation in the active site. Here, to analyze the incorporation efficiency of different proline analogs and to predict the active site residues responsible for the recognition, we carried out molecular docking study with the modeled Escherichia coli prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EcProRS). We also mapped the binding mode for the reported, virtually generated proline analogs and compared it with the reported crystal structure. The reactivity of the reported analogs was correlated with the biochemical data with respect to their interaction and orientation in the active site, which demonstrates the role of active site residues for the recognition of proline analogs and some new substrates such as chloro, bromo and iodoproline for EcProRS. We also rationally designed a EcProRS mutant for desired proline analog and validated by docking simulation with 3D model structure.",

Using compatible polymers to tether the enzyme provides a means of maintaining bulk properties of the carrier while limiting disadvantageous associations that reduce activity retention of the enzyme.

Lactase (Aspergillus oryzae) was then covalently conjugated to the microspheres having the chitosan tether as well as directly to microspheres without the chitosan tether. Relative to the soluble enzyme, activity retention of lactase attached directly to the microspheres without the chitosan tether resulted in 11% activity retention after immobilization. Comparatively, attachment of lactase to microspheres having the chitosan tether yielded a retained activity that was not significantly different from that of the soluble enzyme, under optimum conditions for the immobilized conjugate. Chitosan-tethered microspheres also enabled an increase in protein loading\u2014achieving 18\u00a0mg/g of support compared to 5\u00a0mg/g of support on microspheres without the chitosan-tether. However, beyond a protein loading of 12\u00a0mg/g of support, the immobilization efficiency on chitosan-tethered microspheres decreased. Lactase conjugation to chitosan-tethered microspheres resulted in shift in optimum pH from pH 4.5 to pH 4.0, but no significant change in temperature stability relative to the soluble enzyme.

Morphological evaluation of enzyme particles revealed that high speed rate might devastate the enzyme particles as those particles were susceptible to mechanical force. A ping-pong bi-bi with substrate competitive inhibition by water kinetic model had been proposed to simulate the reaction kinetic of partial hydrolysis. The kinetic constants Vmax, Km (palm oil), Km (water) and Ki were evaluated to be 17.39\u00a0mmol/L/min, 0.55\u00a0mmol/L, 1.04\u00a0mmol/L and 2.68\u00a0mmol/L, respectively using non linear regression analysis with the computer program Microsoft Excel Solver. The model proposed was found to accurately represent the experimental data with determination coefficient R2 of 0.99.",

The enzyme loading was measured as \u223c2.02\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u22121 (76.6\u00a0mg\u00a0protein %) of polyurethane foam. The optimum activity of the immobilized enzyme was detected in the pH range 7.0\u20138.0. The catalytic activity of the immobilized AOx was utilized for the production of n-heptanal. A maximum n-heptanal yield of 20.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2% (w/w) was achieved at a substrate concentration of 10\u00a0mM n-heptanol; beyond this concentration substrate dependent inhibition of the catalytic reaction was observed. The operational stability of the immobilized enzyme was determined and found to be \u223c60% of the initial activity till the fifth reaction cycle, thus providing high cumulative yield of the product.

The thermal stability and the stability in solvated reaction medium of different derivatives of Candida cylindracea lipase (CCL) were evaluated for their hydrolysis activity of p-nitrophenyl butyrate and in obtaining Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA from fish oil triacylglycerols. CCL was immobilized by hydrophobic interactions and by covalent binding. In addition, hydrophobic derivatives were cross linked with functional polymers, such as dextran aldehyde and dextran sulfate, after chemical amination of its surface to prevent lipase desorption. Fish oil hydrolysis reactions were carried out using 35\u00a0U of biocatalyst per gram of oil, at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and with a 1:1 aqueous/organic phase ratio. The aqueous phase was a 40% polyethylene glycol/phosphate buffer solution, pH 7, and the organic phase a 1:4 fish oil/hexane solution. According to its half-life time, the most thermostable derivative corresponds to CCL immobilized in glyoxyl-agarose. Derivatives of CCL immobilized on octyl-agarose (O-CCL) and CCL immobilized on octyl-agarose cross linked with dextran sulfate (O-CCL-NH2-DxSO4) showed an activation effect of about 10 folds compared to its initial activity when they were incubated in solvent and co-solvent biphasic reaction media. After 48\u00a0h of reaction, O-CCL and O-CCL-NH2-DxSO4 were those derivatives with highest yields of fish oil hydrolysis; its differential rate of hydrolysis detected for polyunsaturated fatty acids make them a valuable tool for EPA/DHA glycerides concentration.",

The oxidative 9\u2032,10\u2032 cleavage of structurally related carotenoids by Arabidopsis thaliana carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (AtCCD1) was applied as model reaction. Unlike commonly assumed, non-ionic surfactants differed significantly in their ability to deliver the strongly hydrophobic carotenoid substrates to the enzyme. Even small structural differences in the carotenoid substrates led to different non-ionic surfactants being required for efficient micellar delivery to the enzyme. The reaction velocities using the same substrate but different non-ionic surfactants varied by up to the 19-fold of the lowest value.The kinetic activation of micelle based enzymatic carotenoid cleavage by organic cosolvents was investigated in order to complement published data on this recently discovered effect [1]. The length and saturation of the surfactant aliphatic side chain determined the concentration of water-soluble organic cosolvent at which maximum kinetic activation was achieved. The required cosolvent concentrations were between 6 and 15% (v/v) and led to up to 3.8-fold increased reaction velocities. For specific combinations of enzymes and non-ionic surfactants, kinetic lag phases were observed. Factors of influence on occurrence and duration were investigated and a hypothesis for the underlying mechanism was formulated.The results complement recent studies on the properties of liposomes and micelles as substrate delivery vesicles [1], [2], [3].

Hydrolysates of soybean oil were esterified with glycerol to produce diacylglycerol, and the optimized results for the esterification reaction were with an fatty acids/glycerol molar ratio of 1:4, lipase SMG1 at a concentration of 120\u00a0U/g (U/w, with respect to total reactants), initial water content 1% (w/w, with respect to total reactants) and 30\u00a0\u00b0C, which yielded 62.03% of diacylglycerol in reaction mixture (80.5% in acylglyceride) after 12\u00a0h of reaction. The results showed that lipase SMG1 is a prospective enzyme which could be used in the oils and fats industry.",

This study investigates an enzyme immobilization procedure that immobilizes lipase in a sol\u2013gel supported on diatomaceous earth (Celite\u00ae R632), and determines its potential for biodiesel production in terms of achievable conversion and apparent stability. Four immobilized materials (lipase sol\u2013gels with and without Celite\u00ae at two protein loading levels) were compared in terms of their immobilized protein content, conversion of methanol to methyl oleate, lipase activity, long term stability, and glycerol\u2013water adsorption. The Celite\u00ae R632 sol\u2013gel with high protein loading achieved the maximum conversion in the 6-h reaction period (90%). A drying step was found to be advantageous prior to the reaction, and the absorption of glycerol\u2013water on the Celite\u00ae was only found to be significant at high levels of glycerol. The material was found to be very stable upon storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for up to 1.5 years, losing only about 15% of its percent conversion capacity per year. Based on this study, the supported immobilization technique shows significant potential as a novel catalyst for biodiesel production.",

The effect of chemical modification on the reactivity of NADH for redox reactions catalyzed by dehydrogenases was examined in this work. Compared with the native NADH, kinetics and molecular docking studies with 8-(6-aminohexyl)-amino-NADH showed that its binding with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was not much affected or even enhanced by a factor of 4.9-fold with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), but complicated the binding of substrates to the enzymes. For ADH, the Michaelis constant for acetaldehyde decreased from 0.47 to 0.048\u00a0mM, while that of sodium pyruvate with LDH increased to 0.81 from 0.18\u00a0mM. On the other hand, the modified coenzyme showed a 19.3-fold decrease in turnover number (kcat) with ADH, while a slight increase with LDH. Molecular docking analysis showed that the hexanediamine arm on the modified coenzyme generated an extra hydrogen bond at the active site of ADH, as well as additional hydrophobic interactions with both ADH and LDH. It appeared that the apparently decreased reactivity of modified cofactor with ADH was caused mainly by the enhanced stability of ternary coenzyme\u2013enzyme\u2013substrate complex, while in the case of LDH, the reduced substrate binding as a result of the chemical modification of NADH led to a slight increase in the overall reaction reactivity.",

Besides nitroreduction, Nfr-A1 exhibits a strong NADH oxidase activity in the presence of oxygen, leading to high concentration of H2O2 (up to 200\u00a0\u03bcM). In the presence of (N,N)-dimethyl-5-nitrouracil 1 (dim-NU), Nfr-A1 achieves the reduction of dim-NU double bond to compounds 2 and 3 and in parallel the oxidation of dim-NU to the denitrated five membered derivatives 4 and 5. The reduction is catalyzed by the reduced flavin Fl-Red and resembles those catalyzed by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenases (DPD), during the catabolism of pyrimidines. The oxidative denitration is catalyzed in part by hydrogen peroxide generated through the NADH-oxidase activity, and certainly by the peroxyflavin intermediate Fl-OOH for the other part. The mechanisms of reaction were proposed according to experimental data and literature. These findings together with our previous results on the potential biological role of Nfr-A1, confirm the large spectrum of catalysis supported by this enzyme. The oxidative denitration is sporadically reported in literature and represents a safe and green alternative for the remediation of nitro-compounds.",

An efficient and stable multi-enzyme system is often required for large-scale applications. Herein we report the immobilization of a multi-enzyme system, which catalyzes consecutive reactions by alkyl hydroperoxides reductase (AhpR) on functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). AhpR, composed of H2O2-forming NADH oxidase (nox) and peroxidase (AhpC), protects microorganisms from the toxic effects caused by organic hydroperoxides and regulates H2O2-mediated signal transduction. Both His-tagged nox and AhpC were immobilized via non-covalent specific interactions between His-tagged proteins and modified SWCNTs. The activity and stability of AhpR at different nox/AhpC ratios were examined and the immobilized AhpR system demonstrated ca. 87% of the native enzyme activity. We found that various nox/AhpC ratios may affect overall AhpR activity but not the total turnover number. The amount of intermediate hydrogen peroxide is not influenced by immobilization and it decreases when the weight of AhpC increases, and becomes undetectable when nox/AhpC ratio reaches above 1:50. Hence, we believe that this non-covalent specific immobilization procedure can be applied to multi-enzyme systems with satisfactory activity retention and stability improvement during consecutive reactions.",

We demonstrate that enantiopreference for the R form of butan-2-ol arises mainly from a lower apparent KM. This corresponds to a major contribution of \u0394\u0394GES, the free energy difference between the ES complex formed with the R and S enantiomers, to \u0394\u0394G\u2021, the free energy difference between both transition states, in comparison with \u0394\u0394Gkcat, the activation free energy difference.

In addition, we used, for the first time, the free energy perturbation method to evaluate the free energy difference between tetrahedral intermediates formed with R and S alcohol enantiomers for a series of secondary alcohols. This is a valid model for \u0394\u0394G\u2021.

     "abstract": "Novozyme-435 (N-435) catalyzed polycondensation reaction between different aliphatic (oligo)esters and diamines by precipitation polymerization at elevated temperatures yields various particulate polyamides and poly(amide-co-ester)s. The reaction between diethylsebacate (DES) and 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO) at 60\u00a0\u00b0C in dried toluene leads to a low Mn polyamide (NMR: Mn\u00a0=\u00a0520\u00a0g\u00a0mol\u22121 GPC: Mn\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0g\u00a0mol\u22121 with Mw/Mn\u00a0=\u00a01.3). An improved three-step procedure with an adjusted temperature profile and an optimized amount of enzyme in dried diphenyl ether, yields 97% amide bond formation and a polymer with increased molecular mass (NMR: Mn\u00a0=\u00a05380\u00a0g\u00a0mol\u22121, GPC: Mn\u00a0=\u00a04960\u00a0g\u00a0mol\u22121 with Mw/Mn\u00a0=\u00a03.5). Three step ring-opening and polycondensation reactions between a cyclic ester (ethylene tridecanedioate) with three different diamines were also performed in dried toluene to obtain the corresponding polyamides. Here, diamine with higher alkyl chain length, i.e. 1,12-diaminododecane shows higher activity towards N-435 catalyzed amide bond formation and therefore the produced nylon-12,13 has higher molecular weight (GPC: Mn\u00a0=\u00a08250\u00a0g\u00a0mol\u22121 and Mw/Mn\u00a0=\u00a05.8) compared to the other nylons. By adopting the three step synthetic protocol, a new series of poly(amide-co-ester)s with Mn up to 17,550\u00a0g\u00a0mol\u22121 were produced. Melting and thermal degradation behaviors of these copolymers are compared with pure nylon-8,10 and polyester by DSC and TGA. The microstructure of the synthesized polyamides with different end groups was investigated by MALDI-TOF MS analysis while the particles\u2019 morphology was studied by TEM analysis.",

     "abstract": "Enzymatic modification of vegetable oils can be used to produce plastic fat or structured lipids (SL) avoiding the generation of trans fatty acids. Biocatalysts previously prepared by immobilization of Rhizomucor miehei lipases onto alkylated chitosan microspheres were used to synthesize SL by acidolysis reaction of sunflower oil and palmitic\u2013stearic acids mixture. Effects of some reaction parameters, substrate molar ratio (SR), amount of biocatalyst (E) and amount of solvent (H), over selected response variables were analyzed by applying an incomplete factorial design of three factors with three levels (Box\u2013Behnken). Responses were selected to evaluate not only the development of desired TAG but also the yield and quality of obtained products, through by-products and undesired trisaturated lipids quantification. The analysis of variable effects showed that E was the most significant factor on each analyzed response. Multiresponse optimization with restrictions from practical considerations revealed that maximum saturated fatty acids composition in glycerides of the SL (38.6%) is obtained when SR\u00a0=\u00a03, E\u00a0=\u00a00.34\u00a0g and H\u00a0=\u00a03.2\u00a0ml are used. Under these conditions, a change in the composition of the desired TAG group (monounsaturated TAG) from 2.5% in the original oil to 33.9% in the final product was achieved. On the other hand, time and temperature behavior studies showed that generation of trisaturated triacylglycerols and by-products were favored mainly by increasing temperature. After 12\u00a0h of reaction, overall hydrolysis and esterification reactions rates were comparable. However, TAG distribution continued changing.",

     "abstract": "The production of extracellular lipases by staphylococcal species has been known for many years [1], [2]. Interest in these lipases was originally stimulated by observations that certain pathogenic staphylococci possess lipolytic activity. There are several indications that they are involved in the release of free fatty acids in blood plasma and in skin colonization and related diseases [3], [4]. In addition to this physiological importance, a research was stimulated by the potential use of staphylococcal lipases to synthesize many molecules with high value added. Recently, different staphylococcal lipases were isolated, purified and biochemically characterized. An increased interest of these lipases results from their potential in modern biotechnology. These new lipases are immobilized to be used in non aqueous media as biocatalyst to catalyze the transesterification, the alcoholysis and the esterification of the alcohols with organic acids. This review describes various applications of staphylococcal lipases in detergent, food, flavor, biopolymers, esters and antioxidant.Because of their biological significance and their increasing importance in biotechnology, a thorough understanding of staphylococcal lipases functioning is needed.",

A suitably selective lipase was sought to preferentially esterify l-menthol in organic solvent, hence simplifying separation from the diasteromeric mix through distillation.From an initial screen a commercial Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase (Amano AK) was selected, and vinyl acetate was chosen as a suitable irreversible acyl donor for transesterification. The reaction reagent ratios were optimised, and an enantiomeric excess (ee) of l-menthol of greater than 95% was reproducibly achievable at a conversion of 30% dl-menthol (0.68\u00a0M) at \u226450\u00a0\u00b0C. On the basis of the composition of liquid menthol the reaction had a diastereomeric excess (de) of 82%. The enzyme was recycled 150 times in 5\u00a0ml batch reactions using liquid menthol and achieving an overall yield of 184.3\u00a0g dl-menthol/g commercial enzyme preparation.

     "abstract": "The suicide inactivation kinetics of tyrosinase acting on 3-isopropyl-6-methylcatechol, 3-tert-butyl-6-methylcatechol and 3,6-difluorocatechol was studied. All three substrates act as suicide substrates despite the fact that their 3 and 6 positions are occupied, confirming the mechanism proposed in Biochem. J. (2008) 416, 431\u2013440. Although the most active substrate for the suicide inactivation was 3,6-difluorocatechol, its efficiency was much lower than that of the catechol used as reference. Its r value, the number of turnovers made by one mol of enzyme before its inactivation, is the highest described in the bibliography, highlighting the great difference between the catalytic and inactivation constants. A study of the effect of the pH on the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase showed that both 3-isopropyl-6-methylcatechol and 3-tert-butyl-6-methylcatechol behave as typical substrates of tyrosinase, while 3,6-difluorocatechol behaves differently. The remarkable behavior of 3,6-difluorocatechol when reacts with tyrosinase may be due to the fact that its two hydroxyl groups have very low pK values as a result of the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine atoms in the ortho positions, so that, at pH 7.0, the substrate would be mainly negatively charged. The apparent Michaelis constant shows a minimum value at pH 6.0, but increases at both high and low pH. However, the values of the catalytic constant and maximum apparent inactivation constant do not vary with the pH, so that the r remains practically constant. Under anaerobic conditions, 3,6-difluorocatechol acts as an irreversible inhibitor of the deoxy- and met-tyrosinase forms.",

We employed aldehyde dextran \u2013 a bulky polymeric aldehyde obtained by oxidation of dextran with sodium metaperiodate \u2013 as a crosslinking reagent. The activity of AcT crosslinked with aldehyde dextran and covalently attached to SWNTs (AcT-dex-SWNTs) was \u223c40% of that of native AcT and more than two-fold higher than that of enzyme immobilized directly, i.e., without crosslinking. This relatively high retention of AcT activity was consistent with the nearly complete retention of the enzyme's secondary structure upon attachment to the nanoscale support. Further incorporation of the AcT-dex-SWNTs conjugates into a latex-based paint led to active composites that were used to decontaminate Bacillus spores.",

For 2\u00a0g caprylic acid, under the optimal conditions, with 0.4\u00a0g immobilized lipase, at substrates molar ratio 1:10 (TMP to acid), temperature 40\u00a0\u00b0C and water content controlled under 0.8% (w/w), the total conversion of fatty acid with TMP reached up to 96% and the formation of trisubstituted TMP esters reached 93%. Water content controlled during esterification process was found to be critical for high yield of direct esterification.",

In this work, we report the isolation of eugenitin from cultures of the endophyte Mycoleptodiscus indicus and its potential as additive for Aspergillus niveus glucoamylase activation. The glucoamylase hydrolytic activity increased twofold using 5\u00a0mM of eugenitin and this activation could be explained by the binding mode of eugenitin with the three-dimensional structure of glucoamylase. The in silico prediction of ligand binding sites revealed at least 9 possible interaction sites able to accommodate eugenitin on glucoamylase from Hypocrea jecorina. Besides, we evaluated the effect of pH and temperature on activity and stability, as well as in the hydrolysis of different substrates and kinetic parameters either in presence or absence of eugenitin. The results displayed by eugenitin as additive to glucoamylase activation are promising and provide novel perspectives for applications of fungal metabolites.",

We selected five genes encoding (putative) glycosidases (TTP0042, TTP0072, TTP0220, TTC0107 and TTP0222) from the genome of this strain, and the corresponding recombinant enzymes were overexpressed and purified. Several transglycosylation reactions using cellobiose-induced HB27 cell extracts and the purified recombinant enzymes were assayed. Biochemical properties and biosynthetic capabilities of the HB27 cell extracts and the TTP0042 enzyme were very similar, suggesting that this enzyme was responsible for most of the \u03b2-glycosidase activity detected in the HB27 strain. This was confirmed through the isolation and analysis of a null mutant of its encoding gene. With both, HB27 cell extracts and purified TTP0042 recombinant enzyme, we finally achieved high yields conditions for disaccharide production by transglycosylation with low amounts of self-condensed donor when high concentrations of a 1:5 donor:acceptor molar ratio was used.",

The FAD binding to the apo-form of AzrA was identified by spectrophotometric analysis, and the bound FAD was stably retained in the enzyme molecule without degradation to FMN. On the other hand, no effect of riboflavin on the activity of AzrA was detected and there was no obvious quenching of riboflavin detected with the addition of apoAzrA. By a docking simulation of FAD into the structure of a homolog of AzrA (AzoR from Escherichia coli), we created a FAD-binding model.

While the presence of catalase drastically slows down the P2Ox inactivation, a considerable decrease of the main reaction rate is observed.

The biocatalysts were inactivated in 70% (v/v) dioxane at 5\u00a0\u00b0C down to 25% residual activity. Biocatalysts were then recovered by filtration to remove the inactivation medium and re-incubated in aqueous medium to promote reactivation. The highest level of reactivation (73% recovery of activity with respect to the initial activity before inactivation) was obtained with Gx1-PGA, corresponding to the biocatalyst with stronger multipoint interactions. For Gx2-PGA and CNBrSep-PGA, only 33% and 31% of activity was recovered respectively. When the distortion caused by the organic solvent produces a inactive enzyme structure that cannot be significantly recovered by re-incubation in aqueous medium, complete unfolding of the enzyme molecule by chaotropic agents prior to its refolding by incubation in aqueous medium can be used to recover enzyme activity. When this strategy was used, 70% activity was recovered with Gx1-PGA and Gx2-PGA, but weakly linked CNBrSep-PGA was completely inactivated after unfolding and no activity was recovered by re-incubation in aqueous medium. With respect to enzyme load, full recovery of enzyme activity was obtained with Gx1-PGA by reactivation in aqueous medium up to 74\u00a0IU/gsupport. However, at higher enzyme loads recovery was significantly impaired because of intense protein\u2013protein interaction during biocatalyst inactivation and reactivation.",

The resulting immobilized CRL had better resistance to pH and temperature inactivation in comparison to free CRL, the adaptive pH and temperature ranges of lipase were widened, and it exhibited good thermal stability and reusability. The immobilized CRL was used as biocatalyst for enzymatic esterification of phytosterols with unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) to produce the corresponding phytosterol esters.

With lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of (R)-1-phenylethyl 3(5)-methylpyrazole-N-carboxylate mixture (1a and 1b) in water-saturated organic solvents as the model system, excellent regioselectivity (V1a/V1b\u00a0>\u00a0100) for 3-methylpyrazole-N-carboxylate (1a) is obtainable when selecting Novozym 435 from Candida antartica lipase B, but not Lipase MY-30 from Candida rugosa and Lipase PS-D from Pseudomonas cepacia, as the biocatalyst.

Lipase catalyzed transesterification of the polyol, trimethylolpropane (TMP) with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) or diethyl carbonate (DEC) followed by thermal cyclization was used for synthesis of six-membered cyclic carbonates with pendant hydroxyl and alkoxycarbonyloxyl groups. Immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (Novozym\u00ae435) was used as the catalyst. Mixture of a hydrophilic solvent such as THF for high solubility of TMP, and a hydrophobic solvent such as toluene, were selected as the best solvent system for achieving high substrate conversion and selectivity. A relationship between polyol conversion and solvent hydrophobicity (log\u00a0P) and solvent type, respectively, was established. THF:toluene system at a ratio of 0.5:1.0 (v/v) provided high degree of TMP conversion to product with high proportion of cyclic carbonates (>80%).

The reactivity of DEC was lower than that of DMC. The reaction pathway leading to the formation of cyclic carbonate in this process comprised enzymatic carbonation of TMP with alkylcarbonates and thermal cyclization of linear carbonates. The process affords high degree of conversion of polyol to cyclic carbonates and provides a potentially attractive synthetic route for monomers of polycarbonates and polyurethanes.",

Some interesting and unexplainable observations drew our attention, and the acylase-catalyzed Markovnikov addition was investigated further in this paper. We detected an acylation product in the reaction and found that acetaldehyde was able to improve the reaction rate. Moreover, Markovnikov adduct could be formed using isopropenyl acetate or 2,2,2-trifluoro-ethyl acetate as substrates in the presence of acetaldehyde. Based on these results, it was proposed that the so-called acylase-catalyzed Markovnikov addition actually consisted of three steps identified as acylation, hemiaminal intermediate formation and transesterification.

     "abstract": "Pseudomonas cepacia lipase was immobilized onto the electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous membrane with covalent binding by activating the nitrile groups of PAN using the amidination reaction successfully. The fiber diameters of initial PAN nanofibers were between 150 and 300\u00a0nm. The lipase molecules (1\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm) were observed to be attached onto the nanofiber surfaces. After 5\u00a0min activation and 30\u00a0min reaction with lipase solution, the protein loading has reached saturation point and the immobilized lipase retained 79% activity compared to that of free lipase. The kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, were determined to be 56.7\u00a0mM and 22.5\u00a0U/mg for free lipase and 88.4\u00a0mM and 18.3\u00a0U/mg for immobilized lipase. To compare with free lipase, the pH stability of immobilized lipase was improved significantly in the acidic conditions and the thermal stability of immobilized lipase still maintained 90% of initial specific activity when the temperature achieved 70\u00a0\u00b0C. After being stored at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 20 days, the immobilized lipase kept almost 100% of its initial specific activity. For reusability test, the immobilized lipase still retained 98% of its original specific activity after 10 batch cycles. These results show that the proposed scheme for lipase immobilization has potential in industrial transesterification reaction such as biodiesel production.",

Here we report an endo/exocellulase Rucel5B with 336 amino acids cloned from yak rumen uncultured microorganism, and its recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. This cellulase possesses endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase activity of 220\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u22121 against carboxymethylcellulose and exo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase activity of 52.9\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u22121 against 4-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-cellobioside, and is able to hydrolyze not only amorphous cellulose (carboxymethylcellulose, barley glucan, lichenan, phosphate acid swollen cellulose, etc.), but also crystalline cellulose (filter paper, avicel, etc.). The exo-type action mode of Rucel5B was confirmed by its release of cellobiose from cellooligosaccharides and crystalline cellulose, and its endo-type action mode was confirmed by a time-dependent decrease in the polymerization degree of hydrolysates when Rucel5B was incubated with soluble amorphous cellulose. Therefore, the enzymatic activities, the endo/exo-mode of action and the ability in saccharification of both amorphous and crystalline cellulose make Recul5B a very interesting candidate for efficient saccharification of cellulose.",

In the present study, we report the use of in vitro directed evolution for the creation of a new l-ASNase variant lacking glutaminase activity. A library of enzyme variants was constructed by staggered extension process (StEp) using the genes that code for the l-ASNases from Erwinia chrysanthemy (ErL-ASNase) and Erwinia carotovora (Ecal-ASNase) and screened using activity assays. A variant of the E. carotovora enzyme lacking detectable glutaminase activity was identified. Sequence analysis showed that this variant contained a single point mutation (Leu71Ile). Steady-state kinetic measurements and the analysis of the pH dependence of Vmax and Vmax/Km of l-Asn hydrolysis showed that the mutation causes significant alterations in binding and catalytic properties. Analysis of the molecular model of the mutant enzyme showed that Ile71 may perturb the conformation of important amino acid residues in the linker region which directly affects the catalytic function. The Leu71Ile mutant enzyme was used to assemble a cuvette-based biosensor specific for l-Asn. The enzyme was immobilized by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde on the side of a transparent plastic cuvette. The sensing scheme was based on the colorimetric measurement of ammonia formation using the Nessler's reagent. Calibration curve was obtained for l-Asn, with useful concentration range of 0\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcM for l-Asn.

The highest bglG activity was obtained at pH 5 and a temperature range of 50\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C. This enzyme was shown to act through a retaining-enzyme mechanism. The N-terminal sequence analysis did not reveal any homology with all available sequences in the database. BglG is somehow atypical for multiple reasons: (1) BglG is insensitive to the conventional Coomassie staining protocol and CuCl2 method was applied to reveal the protein; (2) the bglG activity is strongly enhanced by ferrous ion (Fe2+) to 161% at 5 and 10\u00a0mM of Fe2+. Flame spectrometry analysis showed that iron was stoechiometrically and strongly bound to bglG; (3) besides cellobiose, BglG is active on sucrose (114%); a rarely described property among \u03b2-glucosidases and (4) bglG is significantly stimulated by xylose.

The functioning of MaL in different aqueous organic media was excellent. Propylene glycol and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether were better solvents than ethanol or acetone in enzymatic oxidations.

     "abstract": "Immobilization of a bile salt activated lipase from Chinook salmon was achieved on two hydrophobic supports. The salmon lipase immobilized on octyl-Sepharose had approximately 40-fold higher activity (on a dry weight basis) against a tributyrin emulsion than the same lipase immobilized on Lewatit VP OC 1600. It also had approximately 10-fold higher activity than Candida antarctica Lipase B immobilized on Lewatit (Novozym 435). Salmon lipase\u2013octyl-Sepharose was highly active against both ghee and fish oil emulsions. Novozym 435 and salmon lipase-Lewatit had very low activities against the same fish oil emulsion. The vast discrepancies in lipolytic activity between the two forms of immobilized fish lipase, and Novozym 435, may be attributed in part to the conformation of the bound lipases, but also to the different hydrophobicities of the lipase\u2013carrier complexes, which determine the substrate access for hydrolysis. Incubation of the salmon lipase with 40\u00a0mM sodium cholate prior to immobilization on Lewatit resulted in improved enzyme binding. The bile salt is thought to cause the lipase active site loop to open more fully and expose more hydrophobic regions on the enzyme. In contrast, when Lewatit was incubated with 40\u00a0mM cholate prior to lipase addition, significantly less binding was observed. Sodium cholate appeared to have little effect on salmon lipase immobilization on octyl-Sepharose. Immobilization was found to raise the temperature optimum of the salmon lipase against tributyrin. The thermal stability and bile salt requirement of the lipase were not affected by immobilization. The results demonstrate a successful immobilization of an active and functional fish bile salt activated lipase and its potential for low temperature modifications of lipids in emulsions.",

The catalytic performance of a circularly permutated variant of CALB, cp283, with various acyl donors and glycerol was examined. In comparison to wild-type CALB, butyl oleate and ethyl \u03b3-linolenate glycerolysis rates were 2.2- and 4.0-fold greater, respectively. Cp283 showed substrate inhibition by glycerol, which was not the case with the wild-type version. With either ethyl ferulate or vinyl ferulate acyl donors, cp283 matched the performance of wild-type CALB. Changes in active site accessibility resulting from circular permutation led to increased catalytic rates for bulky fatty acid esters but did not overcome the steric hindrance or energetic limitations experienced by arylaliphatic esters.",

GA\u2032 inhibitory effect on TvLac activity was investigated on the oxidation of caffeic acid (CA) by free TvLac and its immobilised form on modified polyethersulfone membrane (PES/TvLac), using spectrophotometric and amperometric biosensor detection methods. The results have indicated that GA presents inhibitory behaviour on TvLac activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The GA concentration leading to 50% activity lost, IC50, was determined to be 19.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0\u03bcM and 5.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0\u03bcM for free and immobilised enzyme, respectively. The results have also shown that GA exhibited a competitive and a mixed inhibition types on the TvLac activity for spectrophotometric and amperometric biosensor methods, respectively. Further GA\u2032 and CA\u2032 cyclic voltammetry studies have demonstrated that GA\u2032 oxidation products interfered with CA\u2032 redox reaction products. In fact, a decrease of the reduction current was observed at cyclic voltammograms of CA, when mixed with GA. Therefore, the GA\u2032 interference on polyphenolic amperometric biosensing is the result of the combination of two factors: on one hand, we have the inhibitory enzymatic effect, and on the other, the reaction of GA\u2032 oxidation products with the o-quinones obtained by the enzymatic oxidation of CA.

A dyeing method was developed for in situ visualization of glycerol in order to study its partitioning and accumulation during the ethanolysis reaction. The method was used to illustrate the interaction of glycerol with immobilized lipases and thus provided an aid for screening supports for lipase immobilization according to their interaction with glycerol. Glycerol was found to have great affinity for silica, less for polystyrene and no affinity for supports made from polymethylmethacrylate and polypropylene. It was also found that the immobilization of enzyme on the support influenced the adsorption of glycerol to the surface of the enzyme carrier.",

Inclusion of the relevant molecular interaction fields could significantly improve the predictive accuracy which suggested that enantioselectivity was a consequence of multiple molecular interactions.

Once assembled along with Ag/AgCl as reference and Pt as auxiliary electrode, the biosensor gave optimum response within 15\u00a0s at pH 7.5 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C, when polarized at +0.4\u00a0V. The response (in mA) was directly proportional to polyphenol concentration in the range 0.2\u2013400\u00a0\u03bcM. The lower detection limit of the biosensor was 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM. The biosensor was employed for determination of polyphenols in tea, beverages and water samples. The enzyme electrode showed 25% decrease in initial activity after 150 reuses over 6 months, when stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.",

AglA was optimally active at pH 5\u20136 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C and had a half-life of 16.8\u00a0h and 1.4\u00a0h at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and 85\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.

Analysis of the reaction with maltooligosaccharides and panose as substrates show that AglA specifically liberates glucose from the non-reducing end indicating that it is typical of a glycoside hydrolase family 31 (GH31) \u03b1-glucosidase. Kinetic analyses revealed that the hydrolytic activity of AglA was greatly affected by the chain length of the substrate and the regiospecificity of the glucosidic linkages. The enzyme showed highest specificity for maltose and decreasing values of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward higher maltooligosaccahrides, although these still serve as substrates.

In industrially feasible and efficient processes, immobilization of enzymes is often required for sufficient enzyme stability and to enable recovery. In recent years, mesoporous materials have become popular as immobilization support due to advantages such as high protein loading capacity and enhanced enzyme activity because of confinement into pores. We used mesoporous silica, for the first time, as immobilization support for feruloyl esterases. The crude enzyme preparation Depol 740L was adsorbed into two SBA-15 mesoporous silica materials of different pore size and the effects of the immobilization on transesterification of methyl ferulate with 1-butanol into butyl ferulate were studied, tested in a reaction system based on 92.5% 1-butanol and 7.5% MOPS buffer (pH 6.0). Immobilization in mesoporous silica with larger pore size (9\u00a0nm) showed higher protein loading and higher specific activity compared to immobilization with smaller pore size (5\u00a0nm). Importantly, adsorption into mesoporous silica changed the product specificity of the enzymes to favor transesterification and decrease the rate of hydrolysis compared to free enzymes. The immobilized enzyme had a butyl ferulate yield of up to 90%, significantly higher compared to free enzymes. Additionally, the immobilized enzymes showed an excellent operational stability and reusability, retaining \u226570% of the initial activity after 6 sequential runs, each lasting 6 days. Consequently, we show that mesoporous silica is a robust immobilization support for feruloyl esterases to be used in the development of biocatalysts for customization of the antioxidant properties of hydroxycinnamic acids.",

     "abstract": "The goal of the present work is to define the partitioning behavior of laminarinase (EC 3.2.1.6) from Trichoderma spp. in soya lecithin liposomes using a thermodynamic approach based on the partitioning variation with the temperature. No information is available yet on use of laminarinase for microencapsulation in liposomes. An attempt has been made to define the stability of liposomes as well as free and immobilized enzyme during the storage under different conditions. The partition coefficients (Ko/w) were greater than 1, therefore the standard free energies of the enzyme transfer are negative, indicating an affinity of enzyme for microencapsulation in liposomes. The enthalpy calculation led to the conclusion that the process is endothermic. The transfer of laminarinase in liposomes is a entropy driven process attributable to positive value of entropy change. The presence of enzyme decreases the liposome storage stability from 70 days to an approximately 20 days at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 40 days at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Monitoring of the liposome's diameter demonstrates that their size and concentration decreases during storage. There was no evidence for liposome fusion process. The stability of immobilized enzyme in the buffer contained suspension did not increase in comparison with free laminarinase, however, stability increased in the soil and phytomass contained systems upon exposure to 254\u00a0nm UV-light for every 12\u00a0h. Thus the present study has theoretical input, as well as practical significance for enzyme application as biocontrol agent.",

In this study, Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase has been immobilized through crosslinking using 2% glutaraldehyde and hen egg white, as an approach towards CLEA preparation. The immobilization efficiency and the properties of the immobilized enzyme in terms of stability to pH, temperature, and denaturants was studied and compared with the free enzyme. Immobilization efficiency of 56% was achieved with hen egg white. The immobilized enzyme displayed a shift in optimum pH towards the acidic side with an optimum at pH 4.0 whereas the pH optimum for free enzyme was at pH 6.0. The immobilized enzyme was stable at higher temperature retaining about 83% of its maximum activity as compared to the free enzyme retaining only 41% activity at 70\u00a0\u00b0C. The denaturation of lipase in free form was rapid with a half-life of 2\u00a0h at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 58\u00a0min at 70\u00a0\u00b0C as compared to 12\u00a0h at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 2\u00a0h at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for the immobilized enzyme.

To this purpose, CalB has been immobilized on Eupergit C (EC) under different conditions and on EC partially modified with ethylenediamine (EDA), iminodiacetic acid (IDA) or metal chelate (IDA-Cu2+) and used for kinetic resolution of (R/S) 4-[2-hydroxy-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]propoxy]benzeneacetamide (rac-atenolol). Enantiomeric resolution of atenolol was carried out by a transesterification reaction using vinyl acetate as acylant agent and an organic solvent as reaction medium. After a preliminary optimization of the reaction to obtain satisfactory yields, toluene was selected as the optimal solvent and the performances of the different CalB biocatalysts were compared. The R enantiomer was preferred in all cases but their performances were substantially different, with high differences in reaction rates, reaction yields in this kinetically controlled synthesis (EC-CalB gave a conversion of 76% while EC-IDA-Cu2+-CalB gave just a 27%), and enantiospecificities (EC-CalB gave an E value of 65 while EC-IDA-Cu2+-CalB gave a value of 13). Replacing toluene with hexane caused a decrease in enzyme activity, reaction yields and enantiospecificity of the reaction. It was remarkable that some preparations were much more sensitive to this solvent change than others. Considering that the activity decreased by less than 10% per reaction cycle, these differences are likely associated with the differences in the enzyme catalytic properties caused by the different immobilization protocols and not by inactivation of immobilized enzyme preparations during the reaction. These results confirmed that use of different immobilization protocols may be a powerful tool for altering enzyme properties when used in organic media.",

We investigated liposome based substrate delivery with regard to qualitative and kinetic effects of vesicle properties on the enzymatic reaction. The cleavage of highly hydrophobic carotenoid and xanthophyll substrates by Arabidopsis thaliana carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (AtCCD1) was used as model reaction for the investigation. Conversions of the partly polar xanthophylls and the fully non-polar carotenes showed different responses to variations in the phospholipid composition of the delivery vesicles. Furthermore, the cellular reaction environment of AtCCD1 was imitated by incorporation of the galactolipid monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol (MGDG) into the liposome membranes. This led to an increase of the specific AtCCD1 activity towards the fully non-polar \u03b2-carotene by approximately 70% at MGDG shares between 8 and 20\u00a0mol% while the specific activity towards the more hydrophilic zeaxanthin decreased with increasing MGDG content. Liposome based systems proved to be less suitable for the delivery of amphiphilic and non-symmetric substrate molecules than micelles due to substrate orientation within the liposome membrane. The results represent a starting point for a systematic design of liposome based delivery of hydrophobic substrates in enzymatic conversions performed in aqueous media.",

Exploitation of the unique properties of HPt-CNTs composites led to the achievement of direct electron transfer between the electrode and the redox active centers of GOD, and the electrode exhibited a pair of well-defined reversible redox peaks with a fast heterogeneous electron transfer rate. In particular, the detection limit (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0M) of this biosensor was significantly lower and the linear range (1.2\u00a0\u03bcM\u20138.4\u00a0mM) was much wider than similar carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Pt-based glucose biosensors.

     "abstract": "Peroxidases are oxido-reductases that have industrial applications. Hemi-parasitic plants which experience continuous oxidative-stress may serve as a source for novel peroxidases. A wild endemic hemi-parasitic plant (Viscum angulatum) from the Western Ghats (India), was selected and the cationic peroxidase VanPrx (pI 9.6) was isolated and purified. Analyses of trypsin digested peptides by LC\u2013MS/MS confirmed that VanPrx was a Class III peroxidase. Further, the matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis showed its molecular weight as 46.42\u00a0kDa. The ultraviolet/visible absorption spectrum is characteristic of heme containing plant peroxidases with a soret peak at 403\u00a0nm and R/Z value of 3.1. Different redox states of VanPrx are not similar to those of Class III peroxidases. Unlike HRP, its Compound I was relatively unstable. Further, it did not show formation of Compound III on addition of high concentration of NADH (200 times the molar concentration of enzyme). In contrast to that of classical plant peroxidases, N-terminal sequence of VanPrx was neither conserved nor blocked by pyroglutamate. Kinetic studies with twelve electron donors showed that VanPrx possessed high activity towards substrates of different chemical nature (viz. guaiacol, ferulic acid, ABTS, etc.). Unlike most cationic peroxidases, a significantly high activity of VanPrx with hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives rather than hydroxycinnamyl alcohols indicates its involvement in suberization. Suberization is associated with seed germination and establishment of haustoria of parasitic plants on the host plant. Unlike other cationic peroxidases, lack of IAA oxidase activity in VanPrx may be associated with the absence of root system in V. angulatum. VanPrx is highly thermo stable and retains partial activity even after an 80\u00a0\u00b0C treatment for 10\u00a0min. Inhibition kinetics revealed that unlike HRP, VanPrx is not inhibited by EDTA. Furthermore, TEMED a competitive inhibitor of HRP inhibited VanPrx uncompetitively. The present study identifies an endemic hemi-parasitic plant as a source of a novel isoform of Class III peroxidase with distinct substrate affinity, redox states, inhibition kinetics of some of the inhibitors and high thermostability.",

However, there are still some limitations when challenging peptides, e.g. containing sterically demanding acyl donors, non-proteinogenic amino acids or proline residues, are to be synthesized. To remedy these limitations, special ester moieties have been used that are specifically recognized by the enzyme, e.g. guanidinophenyl, carboxamidomethyl (Cam) or trifluoroethyl (Tfe) esters, which, unfortunately, are notoriously difficult to synthesize chemically. Herein, we demonstrate that Cam and Tfe esters are very useful for Alcalase-CLEA mediated peptide synthesis using sterically demanding and non-proteinogenic acyl donors as well as poor nucleophiles, and combinations thereof. Furthermore, these esters can be efficiently synthesized by using the lipase Cal-B or Alcalase-CLEA. Finally, it is shown that the ester synthesis by Cal-B and subsequent peptide synthesis by Alcalase-CLEA can be performed simultaneously using a two-enzyme-one-pot approach with glycolamide or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol as additive.",

The immobilization was carried out in three silica nanostructured supports with different pore size MCM-41 (3.3\u00a0nm), SBA-15 (6.4\u00a0nm) and MCF (12.1\u00a0nm).

Catalytic parameters of immobilized and free enzymes were determined at different temperatures (20\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C) and in different acetonitrile/water mixtures (15\u201385% of acetonitrile). The results show that there is low leaching of the enzymes in the three supports assayed and the adsorption capacity (qmax) was higher as the pore size of the support increased. The pore size also produces the enhancement of peroxidase activities on the styrene oxidation. Thus, CPO adsorption into SBA-15 and MCF showed remarkable thermal and solvent stabilities at 40\u00a0\u00b0C showing a total turnover numbers of 48,000 and 54,000 times higher than free CPO, respectively.

The enantioselectivity was calculated for the alcohol (E\u00a0\u2248\u00a03.17) and for the amine (E\u00a0\u2248\u00a01.34).

Thermogravimetric analysis of bioaffinity support revealed 6% loss in weight at 600\u00a0\u00b0C whereas its thermal decomposition was observed at 350\u00a0\u00b0C by differential thermal analysis. No significant change was noticed in the band intensity of pUC19 plasmid upon its treatment with Con A layered Al2O3-NPs. Comet assay further exhibited negligible change in tail length of comet after treating the lymphocytes by bioaffinity matrix. Atomic force microscopy revealed large surface area of Con A layered Al2O3-NPs for binding higher amounts of enzyme. Moreover, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy confirmed binding of \u03b2 galactosidase on bioaffinity support by exhibiting broadening in peaks at 3220.61\u00a0cm\u22121 and 3447.27\u00a0cm\u22121.

     "abstract": "A membrane-associated esterase (E34Tt) was detected in Thermus thermophilus HB27. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity in a three-step protocol. Detergent (CHAPS) above the CMC was found to be essential to solubilise the enzyme from cell membranes as well as for maintaining activity and stability.By using mass fingerprinting, peptides were found to share identity with the YP_004875 protein, which was annotated as putative esterase in the genome analysis of T. thermophilus HB27, although experimental evidence was lacking. No homology was detected with any known lipase or esterase. However, a comparison with the high-scored sequences from a BLASTp search identified the consensus sequence for lipases/esterases between amino acids 157 and 161 (Gly-Cys-Ser159-Ala-Gly). Further inhibition assays with E600 confirmed that Ser159 was involved in the catalytic mechanism.The monomeric enzyme had a molecular mass of 34\u00a0kDa and exhibited esterase activity with preference for medium chain-length esters (C10). E34Tt was noticeable for its high thermal stability; the optimal reaction temperature was higher than 80\u00a0\u00b0C and the half-life of thermal inactivation at 85\u00a0\u00b0C was 135\u00a0min, which makes it even more thermostable than some hyperthermophilic esterases. These properties convert E34Tt into a very attractive enzyme for biotechnological purposes.A theoretical structural model was constructed using as template a prolyl oligopeptidase from Sus scrofa, and a putative catalytic triad (Ser159, Glu255 and His293) with high similarity to the template was identified.",

The specific interfacial area was varied over several orders of magnitude by changing either the amount of emulsified oil or the average diameter of oil droplets. This work particularly focused on the effect of changing droplet size (at given amount of oil) on lipase activity. When the specific interfacial area was varied over several orders of magnitude, the specific activity of the enzyme exhibited a non-monotonic variation with a pronounced maximum. At low specific interfacial area, initial velocity increased with specific interfacial area. Inhibition of enzyme activity at a high interfacial concentration of triglyceride was observed.

Structural exploration of the urease was carried out to find the optimum condition of solvent polarity which provides efficient adsorptive immobilization through emphasizing on dual approaches: creation of hydrophobic intermediates as molten globule like states and improved accessibility of substituted alkyl chains. The optimum percent volume of dioxane in phosphate buffer to fulfill such aim was achieved at 30% (v/v). Restoring of native-like secondary structure was observed using circular dichroism; moreover, improved exposure of hydrophobic surfaces of urease was confirmed using a set of UV-analysis, intrinsic fluorescence, and differential 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonate fluorescence spectroscopy, at 30% as an optimum concentration of dioxane. The yield of immobilization was doubled using reversible denaturation approach and storage stability of the immobilization product of urease was noticeably improved (half live of the multi-used immobilized urease was resulted to be 6.5 folds higher than the half live of the free enzyme). Moreover, 7\u201313.5 folds activation of the enzyme was resulted upon immobilization. Improved immobilization ensures the efficiency of this strategy, for applied approaches, along with providing further evidences for enhanced surface hydrophobicity of the multimeric urease at defined concentration of dioxane.",

A series of acetophenone like compounds reduced with such enzyme was docked showing a distinct preference for binding to the active center. Favorable docking conformations calculated with two different protocols fall into two low-energy ensembles. These conformational ensembles are distinguished by the relative position of a given structure, presenting either the si- or re-face of the ketone to the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) moiety reductant. For the ketones presented here, there is a correspondence between the major enantiomer obtained from the experimental data and the conformer found to have the most stable interaction energy with the receptor site in all cases. Furthermore, based on these two energy data sets we were able to build a reliable quantitative model (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.98; crossvalidation q2\u00a0=\u00a00.78) to predict the percentage of conversion from docking energy and the nature of the substrate with the following equation: conversion (%)\u00a0=\u00a030.80 Ed\u00a0\u2212\u00a072.84\u03c3\u00a0+\u00a0224.34, where Ed is docking energy and \u03c3 is the Mulliken charge of the adjacent group of the ketone.

Among them, BS-LVS was selected for the fructosylation of aromatic or aliphatic alcohols due to its high activity and stability. The effects of acceptor concentration, enzyme concentration and the presence of a co-solvent in the fructosylation efficiency of hydroquinone were evaluated. It was demonstrated that this reaction is kinetically controlled, producing the best yields of phenolic fructosides when 500\u00a0mM of acceptor and 5\u00a0U\u00a0mL\u22121 of enzyme were employed. Higher enzyme loads resulted in the rapid hydrolysis of the products. Increased amounts of organic co-solvent up to 50% (v/v) reduced fructoside yield due to a concomitant decrease in the thermodynamic activity of the acceptor, as confirmed by theoretical calculations using COSMO-RS; moreover, increased fructose transfer to levan and reduced hydrolysis were observed.

A maximum fructoside production (19\u201335\u00a0mM) was obtained with dihydroxybenzene acceptors such as hydroquinone, whereas reactions with primary alcohols, such as benzyl alcohol resulted in lower fructosylation efficiency.

The optimum nanohybrid sample (C) in terms of \u03b1-amylase immobilization was synthesized when water (H2O), tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and methanol (MeOH) were used in 17:1:1 ratio at fixed template amount (0.5\u00a0g of carboxymethyl tamarind gum). Enzyme immobilization efficiency of \u201cC\u201d was further enhanced on calcination in nitrogen atmosphere, the optimum calcination temperature being 400\u00a0\u00b0C (C4).

The amount of \u03b2-galactosidase immobilized onto MAG-PANI was ca. 2.04\u00a0mg/g support. This magnetic enzymatic derivative was capable to act on lactose and to produce tri and tetragalactosides (transgalactosylation) and the catalytic properties were similar to the soluble enzyme. For lactose concentrations up to 100\u00a0g/L, no differences were observed in the enzyme specific activity between free and immobilized forms (100% of specific activity retention), but for higher lactose concentrations the initial specific reaction rate of the immobilized form was affected by increasing lactose concentrations. The Activation Energy values for both free and immobilized forms were similar, around 16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0KJ/mol. The tri and tetra-galactosides production by both soluble and immobilized enzyme was not affected by temperature in the range of 30\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C. As the initial lactose concentration increased from 5% to 50%, the maximum GOS content in the product increased from 11.2% (at 35% conversion) to 26.1% (at 56% conversion) for the free enzyme and from 10.8% (at 33% conversion) to 26.0% (at 52% conversion) for the immobilized enzyme. The MAG-PANI was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analyzer, scanning electronic microscope, differential scanning calorimeter, thermogravimetric analyzer, vibrating sample magnetometer and thermomagnetization. These analysis showed rhombohedra particles presenting good magnetic response, evidences for the PANI coating and protein immobilization and magnetite as the predominant component. This magnetic \u03b2-galactosidase derivative presents the following advantages: simple synthesis using low cost reagents, catalytic properties similar to the soluble enzyme and easy removal from the reaction mixture by a magnetic field and reuse.",

Nonetheless, industrially relevant enzymes are often poorly characterized with respect to enzyme kinetics. For the description of bisubstrate reactions catalysed by oxidoreductases in many cases Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics is used, which is a significant simplification. The NADPH-dependent 3-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase (KR) from Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 is an interesting biocatalyst for the asymmetric synthesis of a variety of chiral building blocks, such as ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate. Initial-rate analysis of the KR-catalysed reduction of ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate to the corresponding (S)-alcohol gave families of straight lines in double-reciprocal plots consistent with a sequential mechanism being obeyed. Product inhibition studies revealed that the KR follows a steady-state ordered Bi Bi mechanism with NADPH binding first. This result was corroborated by fluorescence enhancement studies, which indicated that the cofactor can bind to the free enzyme. The dissociation constants for the binary NADPH\u2013protein complex determined kinetically and by fluorescence titration were identical within experimental error (1.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35\u00a0mM and 1.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23\u00a0mM) and confirmed the accuracy of the obtained kinetic parameters.",

Common immobilization methods, such as physical adsorption, covalent binding, crosslinking, and encapsulation, often cause problems in enzyme leaching, 3D structure change and strong mass transfer resistance. We have previously demonstrated a site-specific enzyme immobilization method, which is based on the specific interaction between a His-tagged enzyme and functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), that can overcome the foresaid constraints. In this work, we broadened the use of this immobilization approach by applying it on other nanomaterials, including multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanospheres. Both supporting materials were modified with N\u03b1,N\u03b1-bis(carboxymethyl)-l-lysine hydrate prior to enzyme immobilization. The resulting nanomaterial\u2013enzyme conjugates could maintain 78\u201387% of the native enzyme activity and showed significantly better stability than the free enzyme. When compared with the SWCNT\u2013enzyme conjugate, we found that the size variance among these supporting nanomaterials may affect factors such as surface curvature, surface coverage and particle mobility, which in turn results in differences in the activity and stability among these immobilized biocatalysts.",

Our results confirmed that LUC-H exhibits enantioselective thioesterification activity toward a series of 2-arylpropanoic acids. The highest activity was observed with ketoprofen. We also observed high enzymatic activity of LUC-H toward long-chain fatty acids. These results were reasonable because LUC-H is homologous with long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase.

     "abstract": "We developed a convenient one-pot procedure for conversion of 5-caffeoylquinic acid to 3-cyclohexylpropyl caffeate, which exhibits an antiproliferative effect toward various human tumor cells. The procedure was comprised of two consecutive reactions by chlorogenate hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.42) from Aspergillus japonicus and Candida antarctica lipase B, and was performed using an ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, as the reaction solvent. When various caffeoylquinic acids from coffee beans, namely, 3-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid were used, the first alcoholysis reaction with methanol using chlorogenate hydrolase produced methyl caffeate with conversion yields of 60.0%, 61.3%, 86.0%, 92.7%, and 114.0%, respectively, to each individual substrate. Two caffeoyl groups of dicaffeoylquinic acids would be used for the synthesis of methyl caffeate. In the subsequent transesterification reaction by C. antarctica lipase B with 3-cyclohexyl-1-propanol, the methyl caffeate produced was converted to 3-cyclohexylpropyl caffeate under reduced pressure to remove the by-product methanol. In the one-pot synthesis, the methyl caffeate was transesterified efficiently to 3-cyclohexylpropyl caffeate by C. antarctica lipase B with deactivation of chlorogenate hydrolase by taking advantage of the difference between the optimum temperatures for the two enzymes. This system provided 12.8\u00a0mM 3-cyclohexylpropyl caffeate from 15\u00a0mM 5-caffeoylquinic acid with conversion yield of 85.3%.",

     "abstract": "An amperometric biosensor was developed for determination of urea using electrodeposited rhodium on a polymer membrane and immobilized urease. The urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to NH4+ and HCO3\u2212 ions and the liberated ammonia is catalytically and electrochemically oxidized by rhodium present in the rhodinized membrane on the Pt working electrode. Three types of rhodinized polymer membranes were prepared by varying the number of electrodeposition cycles: membrane 1 with 10 deposition cycles, membrane 2 with 40 cycles and membrane 3 with 60 cycles. The morphologies of the rhodinized membranes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and the results showed that the deposition of rhodium was like flowers with cornices-like centers. The influence of the amount of electrodeposited rhodium over the electrode sensitivity to different concentrations of ammonia was examined initially based on the cyclic voltammetric curves using the three rhodium modified electrodes. The obtained results convincingly show that electrode with rhodinized membrane 1, which contain the lowest amount of electrodeposited rhodium is the most active and sensitive regarding ammonia. It was found that the anodic oxidation peak of ammonia to nitrogen occurs at 0.60\u00a0V. In order to study the performance of urease amperometric sensor for the determination of urea, experiments at constant potential (0.60\u00a0V) were performed. The current\u2013time experiments were carried out with urease rhodinized membrane 1 (10 cycles). The amperometric response increased linearly up to 1.75\u00a0mM urea. The detection limit was 0.05\u00a0mM. The urea biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity of 1.85\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0cm\u22122 with a response time 15\u00a0s. The Michaelis\u2013Menten constant Km for the urea biosensor was calculated to be 6.5\u00a0mM, indicating that the immobilized enzyme featured a high affinity to urea. The urea sensor showed a good reproducibility and stability. Both components rhodium and urease contribute to the decreasing of the production cost of biosensor by avoiding the use of a second enzyme.",

     "abstract": "A glucose biosensor was developed, which was based on Prussian blue-gold (PB-Au) nanocomposite films and platinum nanoclusters (Pt-NCs). Prussian blue (PB), as an electron mediator, was electrochemically deposited on the glass carbon electrode (GCE) in the presence of chloroauric acid, forming PB-Au nanocomposite films. Then, Pt-NCs were electrodeposited to construct a bilayer film. At last, glucose oxidase was modified on the electrode with the bilayer film and the film of Nafion (Nf) was used to prevent the glucose oxidase (GOD) from leaking off. The resulting amperometric glucose biosensor exhibited a fast response time (within 8\u00a0s) and a linear calibration range from 3.0\u00a0\u03bcM to 1.1\u00a0mM with a low detection limit of 1.0\u00a0\u03bcM glucose (S/N\u00a0=\u00a03). With the low operating potential, the biosensor showed little interference to the possible interferents, including acetum acid, uric acid and arginine, indicating an excellent selectivity. The improved performances of resulting electrode for electrocatalysis-oxidation glucose were ascribed to the high surface-to-volume ratio and the excellent catalytic activity of nanoparticles. The combination of the PB-Au nanocomposite and Pt-NCs would open new horizons for fabrication of biosensors and biocatalysts.",

     "abstract": "The bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars for production of ethanol requires a multienzyme system named cellulase. This system contains enzymes that act synergistically in the hydrolysis of cellulose: endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase and \u03b2-glucosidase. The first two enzymes act directly on cellulose, yielding mainly glucose and cellobiose, which is hydrolyzed into glucose by \u03b2-glucosidase. An industrial process would be more economical by using immobilized systems that allow the reuse of the enzyme and improve the enzyme stability against different inactivation agents. Particularly, the hydrolysis of cellobiose would be performed using immobilized enzyme because cellobiose molecules are soluble in the reaction medium. In this work, \u03b2-glucosidase was immobilized on agarose matrix derivatized with different reactive groups, e.g. polyethylenimine (PEI), glyoxyl (linear aliphatic aldehydes) and amine-epoxy, trying to optimize the stability and activity of the immobilized enzyme. Using reversible attachment (immobilization by anion exchange), the derivatives were active, but with poor thermal stability, e.g. PEI agarose derivative was approximately 7 times more stable than the soluble \u03b2-glucosidase. However, these derivatives have important characteristics for an industrial process: reuse of the enzyme and/or the application of continuous systems. Among the activated supports with irreversible attachment (covalent immobilization), glyoxyl agarose did not reach a good thermal stability; it seems that the enzyme surface is very poor in amino groups from lysine residues. Better results were obtained with amine-epoxy agarose supports. \u03b2-Glucosidase immobilized on that support kept 80% of its activity and was ca. 200 times more stable than the soluble enzyme.",

Immobilization on the hydrophobic surface of macroporous poly(methylmethacrylate) resin resulted in the full retention the lipase active fraction, while immobilization on the hydrophobic surface of mesoporous, amorphous, octyl-modified silica allowed retention of just half of the lipase active fraction. The polar surface of unmodified mesoporous, amorphous silica bound the lipase in such a manner that all of the immobilized enzyme was active. Mesoporous, crystalline SBA-15 silica also bound lipase so that it all was active. The polar, non-porous surface of fumed silica retained only a small fraction (28%) of active lipase. Substantial differences were found among the various supports in their ability to preserve catalytic activity upon vacuum drying. These findings demonstrate that surface polarity alone is not the only determinant for immobilization, as hydrophobic poly(methylmethacrylate) and hydrophilic SBA-15 were equally competent as lipase supports. The ordered-channel mesostructure of SBA-15 may provide a critical balance of interactions with the enzyme to preserve its native conformation.",

     "abstract": "Evidence has been collected that H2O2 resulting from redox reactions taking place in some inhibitor systems, is responsible for the inactivation of urease. Accordingly, in this study the inactivation by H2O2 exogenously added to urease (jack bean) was investigated. The reaction accountable for the inactivation was the oxidation of the enzyme thiol groups. The reaction was studied at pHs over 6.2\u20138.2. At each pH, the first-order kinetics was obeyed, the resulting dependences of kobs on H2O2 concentration being hyperbolic. Analyzed with Kitz-Wilson method, the kinact appeared to be invariant with pH, while the inhibitor binding constant KI decreased with increasing pH. Consequently, the process grew faster with an increase in pH, the second-order rate constants increasing from 0.0032\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 at pH 6.2 to 0.0615\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 at pH 8.2, consistent with higher susceptibility of thiolate anions to oxidation by H2O2 compared to reduced thiols. The reactions always resulted in irreversible inactivation of urease, indicative of the oxidation of thiol groups to either sulfinic or sulfonic acid, independent of the extent of inactivation. Analysis of the numbers of urease thiol groups modified with H2O2 revealed that for the complete inactivation, out of 36 thiols/molecule available under non-denaturating conditions, the rapid oxidation of 30 highly reactive \u2013SH groups was responsible for a 50% loss in enzyme activity, and the slower oxidation of the remaining six \u2013SH groups, for the other 50%. The enzyme was protected by active-site binding inhibitors, boric acid and fluoride, from the inactivation, suggesting that the six thiols are the active-site flap Cys-592s. For comparison with other urease inhibitors, the IC50 was determined for 20\u00a0min incubation with H2O2, its value changing from 242\u00a0mM at pH 6.2 to 11\u00a0mM at pH 8.2.",

The conversion was dramatically dependent on the water content and the LipK107 showed high activity in a wide range of water content without appreciable loss of enzyme enantiodiscrimination. Besides, the chain length of acyl donor also had a significant effect on the conversion, and the highest enantioselectivity was achieved when methyl palmitate was used. Based on the analysis of computer model structure of LipK107, different mutations were introduced into the lid region. Each derivative of LipK107 was expressed, purified, and assessed of the activity. According to the prediction, using mutants E130L\u00a0+\u00a0K131I and T138V as catalyst, respectively, the conversions of 1-phenylethanol improved greatly with a slight increase of enantiodiscrimination.

     "abstract": "Laccases (benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.2), a multicopper oxidase enzyme, widely distributed in plants, fungi and bacteria have ability to catalyze oxidation of various phenolic and non-phenolic compounds as well as many environmental pollutants. The diversified functions of laccases, including the antagonistic ones such as their involvement in lignin biosynthesis (in plants) as well as lignin degradation (in fungi and bacteria), make them an interesting enzyme for study from the point of view of their structure, function and application. Important applications of laccases include delignification, pulp bleaching and bioremediation. The ability of laccases to polymerize natural phenols helps to develop new cosmetic pigments, hair dyeing materials, deodorants, toothpastes, mouthwashes and other useful products.Recently, the utility of enzyme has also been shown in the nanoparticle based biosensor technology as well as in medical fields. In the present review, a comparative account of the bacterial, fungal and plant laccases has been presented from these points of views. Laccases are dimeric or tetrameric glycoproteins usually containing four copper atoms per monomer. To perform catalytic function, laccase depends on Cu atoms that are distributed at the three different copper centers. These copper centers in laccases are categorized into three groups: Type-1 or blue copper center, Type-2 or normal copper and Type-3 or coupled binuclear copper centers. The four copper atoms are differing in their characteristic electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. The phylogenetic analysis reveals, laccases from these groups (viz. bacteria, fungi and plant) form independent clades, in consistent with that of taxonomical classification. From previous experimental evidence and from in silico studies, it is evident that despite their wide taxonomic distribution and substrate diversity, molecular architecture of laccases is common to multicopper oxidases. Three dimensional structure predictions, at monomeric level, for all laccases (bacterial, fungal and plant) suggest that they are composed of three sequentially arranged cupredoxin-like domains. Multiple alignment of primary sequences of all three modeled laccases shows that, the copper binding motives are highly conserved in all sequences. The similarities are more significant in the N- and C-terminal regions, corresponding to Domains 1 and 3, as the copper interacting motif is present in Domains 1 and 3 not in Domain 2. This structural conservation reflects a common reaction mechanism for the copper oxidation and the O2 reduction in these enzymes. Putative binding pocket analysis depicts, larger binding cavity for bacterial laccase as compared to those for plants and fungi. An in depth analysis of copper binding site, yielded significant differences in conserved residues for laccases of bacteria, fungi and plants which provided the basis for the dual and contrasting functions of laccases.",

     "abstract": "Salmonella enterica is the main cause of food-borne disease worldwide and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains has become a major public health concern. To combat the resistant pathogens, screening of new antibacterials with novel targets or mechanisms of action is very urgent. Luteolin, a traditional Chinese medicine monomer, was proven to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of FabI, the sole enoyl-ACP reductase (ENR) from S. enterica (SeFabI), with the inhibition constant (Ki) of 15.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcM. Three missense mutations SeFabI[G93V], SeFabI[G93S], and SeFabI[Y156F] were designed to investigate the structure\u2013activity relationship between the inhibitor and the SeFabI target. The specific activities and substrate affinities of SeFabI[G93V] and SeFabI[G93S] were similar to the wild-type SeFabI, while SeFabI[Y156F] lost the substrate catalytic activity, which was consistent with the mechanism for catalytic activity of FabI from Escherichia coli (EcFabI) described previously. SeFabI[G93V] mutation showed high level luteolin resistance, which was consistent with the studies in E. coli by triclosan. Interestingly, the SeFabI[G93S] showed both luteolin sensitivity and triclosan resistance, and the difference could be explained by the structure discrepancy between luteolin and triclosan. These data imply that the Gly-93 and Tyr-156 are key amino acid residues for luteolin in the active site of the target. As a phytochemical, it has been certified to be safe, thus luteolin would be able to develop as a lead compound for combating resistant bacteria.",

     "abstract": "Various bacterial and fungal strains were screened for their ability to catalyse the regioselective hydrolysis of 1-benzylpyrrolidine-2,5-dicarbonitrile (1). Among the examined strains, Rhodococcus opacus sp-lma whole cells transformed both isomers of 1 into 1-benzyl-5-cyano-2-pyrrolidinone (2) and N-benzylacetamide (3). These reactions are difficult to achieve chemically and the synthesis of compound 2 did not compete with microbiological catalysis in terms of efficiency and respect for the guidelines of green chemistry. To distinguish between an oxidative or hydrolytic based-mechanism, the origin of the oxygen atom in 2 was investigated by using 18O2 and 18OH2 coupled with GC\u2013MS analysis. These experiments confirmed that the oxygen atom in 2 came from water and not from molecular oxygen. The reaction is probably initiated by the dehydrogenation of 1 to generate the iminium ion, which could be trapped by a water molecule to form the cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin intermediate would spontaneously break down to the \u03b3-lactam product 2. Conversion of 1 to 2 by induced rat liver microsomes suggests the involvement of a Cyt P-450-type enzyme. A mechanism that accounts for the formation of 3 is also proposed.",

Many lipases preserve their activity at extreme temperatures and pH, and in the presence of surfactants, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and therefore they can be applied in laundry formulations. Bacillus lipases display diverse selectivity to the chain length of the acid, and few enzymes show positional specificity. Several enzymes can be applied in the production of enantiopure compounds for the pharmaceutical industry due to their remarkable enantioselectivity. The immobilization experiments with Bacillus lipases, though a limited number, illustrate the vast possibilities for optimization of the properties of the biocatalysts for a particular application.

One of the key emerging characteristics of these intragenomic complements of enzymes is the impressive breadth of catalytic diversity that is observed within them. This diversity may have been acquired either in order to combat the spectrum of metabolic challenges with which the organism may be presented in its natural environment or as part of the biosynthetic machinery evolved to produce a spectrum of secondary metabolites that will prove to be advantageous in establishing a niche.

Effects of various process conditions on (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl caproate synthesis employing germinated rapeseed lipase acetone powder in organic solvent were investigated. Rapeseed lipase catalyzed ester formation more efficiently with non-polar compared to polar solvents despite high enzyme stability in both types of solvents. Maximum ester yield (90%) was obtained when 0.125\u00a0M (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and caproic acid were reacted at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h in the presence of 50\u00a0g/L enzyme in heptane. Enzyme showed little sensitivity towards aw with optimum yield at 0.45, while added water did not affect ester yield. Esterification reduced by increasing molecular sieves (>0.0125%, w/v). The highest yields of caproic acid were obtained with isoamyl alcohol (93%) followed by butanol and (Z)-3-hexen-1-o1 (88%) respectively reflecting the enzyme specificity for straight and branched chain alcohols. Secondary alcohols showed low reactivity, while tertiary alcohol had either very low reactivity or not esterified at all. A good relationship has been found between ester synthesis and the solvent polarity (log\u00a0P value); while no correlation for the effect of solvents on residual enzyme activity was observed.

Reactivation yields were increased with respect to the control (fully aqueous medium) when cosolvents were added to the reactivation medium at concentrations below 50% (v/v). Best results were obtained with 30% (v/v) ethyleneglycol (EG) in both reactivation strategies.

Catalytic modulators were also included in the reactivation medium: competitive inhibitors (phenylacetic acid and 2-thienylacetic acid) caused a reduction while non-competitive (7-ADCA and 6-APA) caused an increase in reactivation yield. Combining cosolvent and catalytic modulators, best results in both strategies were obtained with 30% (v/v) EG plus 100\u00a0mM 7-ADCA, where an increase in reactivation yield from 36.0 to 96.0% and from 50.0 to 98.0% was achieved with unfolding\u2013refolding and direct incubation in reactivation media respectively. Apparent reactivation rate was higher in the case of direct incubation in reactivation media, best results being obtained when using 100\u00a0mM 7-ADCA and 30% (v/v) EG, with an increase with respect to the control (fully aqueous medium with no modulator) from 0.309\u00a0h\u22121 to 1.129\u00a0h\u22121, while for unfolding\u2013refolding strategy increase was only from 0.124\u00a0h\u22121 to 0.384\u00a0h\u22121.

A drastic behavior change is observed by altering the media from a hydrophobic IL to a hydrophilic IL.

The use of other lipases resulted in the desired epoxidized derivative and also in the 1,2-diol as a result of a reversible epoxy ring-opening promoted in the reaction media.

This bioconversion requires three oxidation steps: a hydroxylation of one methyl group followed by the oxidation of the corresponding alcohol into the aldehyde and finally its oxidation into the carboxylic acid. The oxidation reaction of each step has been studied. Terfenadine and intermediates incubated with whole cells were not oxidized under argon whereas their biotransformation under 18O2-enriched atmosphere gave labeled fexofenadine. P450 inhibitors, such as clotrimazole or fluconazole, inhibited oxidation activity of each step.

In this study, sodium alginate was used as immobilization material and glycidyl methacrylate was grafted onto sodium alginate.

The molecular mass of sodium alginate was calculated as 15,900\u00a0Da. Graft polymerization was made in two steps. Firstly, sodium alginate was activated with benzophenone using UV-light at 254\u00a0nm. Secondly, glycidyl methacrylate was grafted under UV-light at 365\u00a0nm onto activated sodium alginate. Grafted glycidyl methacrylate was determined gravimetric and titrimetric.

Various fatty acids which are also the substrates of lipases in esterification reactions were used as active site protecting agents during the immobilization process in an organic solvent. The obtained results showed that covalent immobilization carried out in the presence of fatty acids as protective ligands improved the hydrolytic and esterification activity of immobilized enzyme.

     "abstract": "Previously it has been shown that glycerol can be regioselectively glucosylated by sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides to form 2-O-\u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl-glycerol (Goedl et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47 (2008) 10086\u201310089). A series of compounds related to glycerol were investigated by us to determine the scope of the \u03b1-glucosylation reaction of sucrose phosphorylase. Both sucrose and glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) were applied as glucosyl donor. Mono-alcohols were not accepted as substrates but several 1,2-diols were readily glucosylated, proving that the vicinal diol unit is crucial for activity. The smallest substrate that was accepted for glucosylation appeared to be ethylene glycol, which was converted to the monoglucoside for 69%. Using high acceptor and donor concentrations (up to 2.5\u00a0M), sucrose or G1P hydrolysis (with H2O being the \u2018acceptor\u2019) can be minimised. In the study cited above, a preference for glucosylation of glycerol on the 2-position has been observed. For 1,2-propanediol however, the regiochemistry appeared to be dependent on the configuration of the substrate. The (R)-enantiomer was preferentialy glucosylated on its 1-position (ratio 2.5:1), whereas the 2-glucoside is the major product for (S)-1,2-propanediol (1:4.1). d.e.ps of 71\u201383% were observed with a preference for the (S)-enantiomer of the glucosides of 1,2-propanediol and 1,2-butanediol and the (R)-enantiomer of the glucoside of 3-methoxy-1,2-propanediol. This is the first example of stereoselective glucosylation of a non-natural substrate by sucrose phosphorylase. 3-Amino-1,2-propanediol, 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol, 1-thioglycerol and glyceraldehyde were not accepted as substrates. Generally, the glucoside yield is higher when sucrose is used as a donor rather than G1P, due to the fact that the released phosphate is a stronger inhibitor of the enzyme (in case of G1P) than the released fructose (in case of sucrose). Essentially the same results are obtained with sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis.",

     "abstract": "Surfactant-enveloped enzymes (SEEs) were prepared from pure cellulases, cellobiohydrolase I and endoglucanase I (Cel7A and Cel7B, respectively), via simply freeze-drying water-in-oil emulsions, wherein the aqueous phase containing each cellulase was stabilized with the nonionic surfactant, dioleyl-N-d-glucona-l-glutamate. The enzymatic tolerance of SEEs to various nonaqueous solvents was investigated, aiming at a novel synthetic approach in biocatalytic glycoengineering. SEE-Cel7A preserved ca. 67% of the original activity after 3\u00a0h incubation in lithium chloride (LiCl)/dimethylacetamide (DMAc) that is a good solvent for carbohydrates but completely deactivates intact enzymes. This excellent enzymatic durability depended on the preparation conditions of SEEs, e.g. pH and salt species of the aqueous phase during SEE preparation. SEE-Cel7A or SEE-Cel7B was applied as a biocatalyst to synthesize cellulose, a sugar polymer which is insoluble in common solvents but dissolves in LiCl/DMAc. Both SEEs could catalyze the direct dehydration of cellobiose without any activation of the anomeric carbon, a property that is indispensable for conventional chemo-enzymatic synthesis. The SEE-Cel7A provided short-chain cellulose with the degree of polymerization (DP) ca. 20, and longer-chain cellulose with DP ca. 60 was preferentially obtained by the SEE-Cel7B, possibly through preferential reverse hydrolysis instead of inherent hydrolysis. Nonaqueous SEE-mediated biocatalysis using inexpensive glycohydrolases and sugars that do not need to be chemically modified beforehand would have potentially wide applications in glycoengineering.",

Each enzyme can hydrolyze its natural substrate, dalcochinin-8\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside and linamarin, respectively, but not the natural substrate of the other enzyme. Linamarase can transfer glucose to primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols with high efficiency, while dalcochinase can transglucosylate primary and secondary alcohols at moderate levels. In this study, eight amino acid residues in the aglycone binding pocket of dalcochinase were individually replaced with the corresponding residues of linamarase, in order to identify residues that may account for their catalytic differences. The residues I185 and V255 of dalcochinase appeared important for its substrate specificity, with their respective mutations resulting in 24- and 12-fold reductions in kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of dalcochinin-8\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside. Transglucosylation activity was improved when I185, N189 and V255 of dalcochinase were replaced with A201, F205 and F271 of linamarase, respectively, suggesting these residues support transglucosylation in linamarase. Among these three mutants, only the N189F mutant showed significant increases in the rate constants for the reactivation of trapped glucosyl-enzyme intermediates by all alcohols. Together, our results suggest that both hydrophobicity and geometry are important determinants for substrate specificity in hydrolysis and transglucosylation by these family 1 \u03b2-glucosidases.",

The reference reaction is the reduction of acetophenone to (R)-1-phenylethanol with concomitant oxidation of 2-propanol to acetone for the purpose of regeneration of the redox cofactor.It could be clearly shown that not the thermostability of the cofactor, but the thermostability of the proteins in the solid dry state govern the order of magnitude of the operational stability of both purified enzymes in the gas/solid reactor at low thermodynamic activity of water and substrate. However, at higher thermodynamic activity the operational stability in the gas/solid reactor is overlaid by stabilizing and destabilizing effects of the substrates that require further investigation. We demonstrated first evidence that the substrate affinity of the two variants in the gas/solid reactor is similar to the affinity in aqueous medium. We could also show that partial unfolding of the proteins with subsequent aggregation are the factors governing protein thermo-in-stability both in the dissolved and in the dry state. Thus, stability investigations of enzymes in the dry state are suggested to predict their basal level of operational stability in gas/solid reactions.",

Docking calculations showed that the mutation altered the orientation of indole, and that the C-2 of the indole pyrrole ring was closer to the heme iron of P450 BM-3 than the C-3. The mutation possibly shifted the hydroxylation preference of P450 BM-3 for indole from the C-3 to C-2, which may be responsible for the reversal of distribution of the product yield.

The combined use of Lipase AY and Lipase AK gave a higher yield of biodiesel than using Lipase AK alone. The optimal conditions for biodiesel synthesis using mixed lipases in a batch system were: 2% water content, 10% enzyme dosage and 3:1 molar ratio of ethanol to oil. The mixed lipases could be used in 15 replicates with retained relative activity higher than 50%. In a continuous system using mixed lipases packed in packed-bed reactor, >67% of biodiesel was achieved.",

Among lipases from different origins, the immobilized Novozym 435 lipase from microorganism was found to be the best biocatalyst, while plant lipase from Carica papaya and animal lipase from Porcine pancreas are quite ineffective as biocatalyst for the esterification of plant stanols with fatty acid.

The immobilization of DGCs for continuous c-di-GMP production is challenging because the dimerization and conformational changes accompanied with the chemical transformation could be impeded by the entrapment of the enzyme. Here we demonstrate that an engineered thermophilic diguanylate cyclase (etDGC) cloned from Thermotoga maritime can be effectively encapsulated in both the methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS) and tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) gels. However, only the enzyme immobilized in the MTMOS gel through a gradual gelation process exhibited enzymatic activity. The immobilized enzyme exhibits extended lifetime and catalytic activity in comparison to the free enzyme in solution, suggesting that the sol\u2013gel immobilized etDGC could be used as a stable and convenient reagent for long-term storage and in situ synthesis of c-di-GMP or 32P-labelled c-di-GMP.

The enzyme can be used for synthesis of pyridoxamine, a promising candidate for prophylaxis and treatment of diabetic complications. A disadvantage of PPAT for industrial application to the synthesis is that it requires an expensive amino acid l-alanine as an amino donor. Here, mutated PPATs with a high activity toward 2-oxoglutarate (and hence toward l-glutamate) were prepared by a rational design plus random mutagenesis of the wild-type PPAT because l-glutamate is readily and economically available. The PPAT(Y35H/V70R/F247C) showed 9.1-fold lower Km and 4.3-fold higher kcat values than those of the wild-type PPAT. The model of the complex of mutated PPAT and pyridoxyl-l-glutamate showed that \u03b3-carboxyl group of l-glutamate was hydrogen-bound with an imidazole group of His35. The production of pyridoxamine from pyridoxal with transformed Escherichia coli cells expressing the mutated PPAT did not correlate with the kcat value or catalytic efficiency of the mutated PPAT but with Km value at a low level. E. coli cells expressing the PPAT(M2T/Y35H/V70K/E212G) could be used for in vitro conversion of pyridoxal into pyridoxamine at 30\u00a0\u00b0C with l-glutamate as an amino donor.",

A relationship between the concentration of d-serine in cerebrospinal fluid and neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been hypothesized. A simple and accurate d-serine assay system would be useful in the study and diagnosis of these diseases. Previously, we developed an enzymatic assay of d-serine using d-serine dehydratase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactate dehydrogenase and NADH. Although this method can detect 10\u00a0\u03bcM d-serine, a 10-fold increase in sensitivity is required for the assay to be useful for the study and diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this study, we increased the sensitivity of this assay to detect submicromolar concentrations of d-serine. In the new assay, d-serine dehydratase converts d-serine to pyruvate, which is in turn oxidized by pyruvate oxidase. Then, in the presence of horseradish peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide formed during the oxidation converts 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxy-phenoxazine (Amplex\u00ae Red) to resorufin, which exhibits a strong fluorescence.

     "abstract": "Random mutagenesis and screening for enzymatic activity was used to engineer Escherichia coli acetyl esterase to enhance its enzymatic activity. A gene encoding E. coli esterase was subjected to PCR random mutagenesis. The mutated esterase gene was expressed in E. coli cells, and the variants were screened for esterase activity by observing halo formation on a tributyrin plate. The screening of a variant with enhanced halo formation allowed us to isolate the Arg48Ser (R48S) mutation, which was predicted to be close to the substrate-binding site. Kinetics analysis using p-nitrophenyl butylate as the substrate demonstrated that the R48S mutant exhibits esterase activity significantly greater than that of the wild-type esterase with the kcat/Km value of the wild-type enzyme by 2.6-fold (3.0-fold in kcat). The replacement of Arg48 by Ala or Glu also increased the kcat value, whereas that by Lys did not. These results suggest that the replacement of Arg by neutral or acidic residues facilitates the release of the fatty acid product due to the loss of interaction between the positive charge of Arg and the negative charge of the fatty acid product, thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, kinetics analysis using tributyrin as the substrate demonstrated that the Km and kcat value of the R48S mutant are, respectively, 3.4-times smaller and 2.8-times larger than those of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the replacement of Arg48 by Ser could relieve the steric hindrance caused by the bulky alcohol moiety of the substrate, thereby facilitating substrate binding. Unexpectedly, the R48S mutation was found to enhance the thermostability of the enzyme as well. The temperature at which the enzyme activity is inactivated by 50% for a 10-min incubation of the R48S mutant was estimated to be 66\u00a0\u00b0C, which was 5\u00a0\u00b0C higher than that of the wild-type enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Flavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenolic antioxidants of increasing biotechnological interest. Through lipase-catalyzed bioprocesses, they can be selectively converted into acylated derivatives displaying improved stabilities and bioavailabilites within nutritional or cosmetic formulations. In order to better understand the molecular basis for the selectivity in these bioconversions, we previously described the application of an enzyme\u2013substrate docking protocol, which identified the most favourable orientations of the flavonoid glycosides isoquercitrin and rutin and their aglycon analogue quercetin within the catalytic cavity of the Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB). In the present work, we further applied quantum chemical calculations, based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT), in these enzyme\u2013substrates complexes. The goal is to verify if the flavonoids OH groups reaching the CALB catalytic residues Ser105 and His224 are expected to form the ester bond that leads to the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate. According to the DFT results, after the transfer of the OH proton to the His224, an ester bond with the carbonyl carbon of the Ser105-bound acetate is expected to be formed for the glucose 6\u2033-O of isoquercitrin and for the rhamnose 4\u2033\u2032-O for rutin. On the contrary, this ester bond is not expected to be formed with the B-ring 3\u2032-O of quercetin. These theoretical results agree with available experimental data concerning the CALB-catalyzed acetylation of these three flavonoids and show that the reaction selectivity is influenced not only by the structural accessibility of the flavonoids OH groups to the catalytic residues, but also by the intrinsic chemical reactivity these OH groups.",

In the case of the hematin/H2O2 system, the decolorization of Eriochrome Blue Black R solutions decreased with the increase of the dye concentration reaching only a removal of 30.2% at the highest dye concentration tested. Fluorescein decolorization in the presence of HRP was very good at 25\u00a0mg/L (near 85%) but decreased to 35.7% as the dye concentration increased to 150\u00a0mg/L. On the other hand, hematin was poorly active as catalyst for Fluorescein elimination. The use of hematin as catalyst instead of HRP has advantages from the technological and economical points of view for Eriochrome Blue Black R. Hematin can be considered an adequate alternative to the use of enzymatic catalysts based on peroxidases.",

The objective of this work was to investigate the influence of mutations in the tunnel entrance of toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO) from Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 on rate, regioselectivity, and enantio-selectivity, in comparison with mutations located in the active site. Residue TmoA D285, located at the tunnel entrance, distant from the active site was randomized, as well as residue I100 which is positioned in the vicinity of the diiron center. Both libraries were screened for regioselective hydroxylation of phenylethanol (PEA), and enantioselective oxidation of methyl p-tolyl sulfide and styrene. It was discovered that mutations at position 285 enhanced the rate of catalysis but did not affect the specificity. Substitutions D285I and D285Q were beneficial for the oxidation of the large and bulky substrates PEA and methyl p-tolyl sulfide (8\u201311-fold improvement), however variant D285S improved the activity rate for styrene oxidation (1.7-fold). Thus, the extent of improvement in rate, and the best amino acid replacement were substrate dependant. In contrast, mutations at position I100 influenced the activity rate and the selectivity for all three substrates tested. Combining the effects by mutating both \u201cgates\u201d, to the tunnel entrance along with the active site, resulted in an additive or even synergistic outcome on enzyme activity and selectivity.",

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this novel lipase represents a new subfamily of family I of bacterial lipases, annotated as family I.8.

In the test conditions applied here it has a maximum activity at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 9.0 and displays extreme thermal stability. Interestingly, it was not only stable, but was also activated by treatment with polar organic solvents including propanol, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).

The reliable in situ monitoring of biocatalyzed reactions has been a challenge where reactions run in aqueous solutions. Limited work has been published on the use of spectroscopic methods for on-line analysis of biocatalytic reactions up to now.

The kinetic parameters of the free and the immobilized lipases, Km and Vmax were calculated, as well. Moreover, the application of immobilized lipase to the hydrolysis of different vegetable oils was realized. The effect of organic solvents on olive oil hydrolysis was examined and time course of the oil hydrolysis was studied. The optimum pH was shifted from 6 to 7 by immobilization of the enzyme.

We have studied the enzyme kinetics of FucO with a spectrum of putative alcohol and aldehyde substrates to map the substrate specificity space. Additionally, for a more detailed analysis of the kinetic mechanism, pH dependence of catalysis, stereochemistry in hydride transfer, deuterium kinetic isotope effect of hydride transfer and effect of increasing solvent viscosity were also analyzed. The outcome of this study can be summarized as follows: FucO is highly stereospecific with the highest E-value measured to be 320 for the S-enantiomer of 1,2-propanediol. The enzyme is strictly regiospecific for oxidation of primary alcohols. The enzyme prefers short-chained (2\u20134 carbons) substrates and does not act on bulkier compounds such as phenyl-substituted alcohols. FucO is an \u2018A-side\u2019 dehydrogenase transferring the pro-R-hydrogen of NADH to the aldehyde substrate. The deuterium KIEs of kcat and kcat/KM were 1.9 and 4.2, respectively, illustrating that hydride transfer is partially rate limiting but also that other reaction steps contribute to rate limitation of catalysis. Combining the KIE results with the observed effects of increasing medium viscosity proposed a working model for the kinetic mechanism involving slow, rate limiting, product release and on-pathway conformational changes in the enzyme\u2013nucleotide complexes.",

     "abstract": "Modelling of inactivation kinetics was applied to assess the thermal stability of Agaricus bisporus tyrosinase preparations of different levels of purity. Experiments were carried out for a raw enzyme extract and preparations obtained after salting-out and ionic chromatography separation steps at six temperatures ranging from 30 to 55\u00a0\u00b0C. Each inactivation run was first fitted separately using a kinetic model derived from an irreversible one-step mechanism. The first-order model was then verified using multitemperature evaluation in which the initial heating period was considered and temperature dependence of the rate constants was expressed through the Arrhenius equation. The modeling results showed that (i) unidentified compound(s) caused a lower thermal stability of the enzyme in the raw extract compared to that of the purified preparations; (ii) the estimated inactivation rate constants for the cresolase activity loss were two\u2013three times higher than those for the catecholase activity loss, which indicated that the oxy-form of tyrosinase was more prone to thermal denaturation than the met-form.",

     "abstract": "Disperse dyes are frequently used worldwide for dyeing polyester, nylon, cellulose acetate and acrylic fibers. The highly variable and complex chemical structure of the dyes makes them difficult to remove using conventional wastewater treatment systems. Redox mediated enzymatic catalysis has wide applications including degradation of polycyclic compounds, phenols, aromatic amines, biphenyls, pesticides, insecticides etc. We investigated the effect of Trichosanthes diocia peroxidase along with redox mediators on decolorization of water insoluble disperse dyes; Disperse Red 19 and Disperse Black 9. Nine different redox mediators; bromophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, guaiacol, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, m-cresol, quinol, syringaldehyde, vanillin and violuric acid were evaluated. Results indicated that among the chosen mediators, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) was most effective for decolorization. At a concentration of 0.45\u00a0U\u00a0mL\u22121 the peroxidase could decolorize Disperse Red 19 to a maximum of 79% with O.2\u00a0mM 1-hydroxybenzotriazole whereas Disperse Black 9 decolorized upto 60% with 0.5\u00a0mM 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. The time, pH and temperature at which maximum decolorization were recorded was 60\u00a0min, 4 and 42\u00a0\u00b0C. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Mann Whitney test. The study suggests that peroxidase from T. diocia could be a cheap, easy, effective source and along with redox mediators be used to treat recalcitrant synthetic dyes.",

     "abstract": "Polystyrene (PST) microspheres are commonly chosen as immobilization carriers due to their unique advantages such as ideal mechanical strength, adjustable particle size, and favorable chemical stability. However, there were few reports on immobilization by using microspheres with large pore sizes (>100\u00a0nm). We have successfully prepared the PST microspheres with macropores and gigapores by a novel method. In this study, giga-/macro-/meso-porous PST microspheres (314\u00a0nm, 104\u00a0nm, and 14.7\u00a0nm in pore sizes) were employed to immobilize lipase (from Burkholderia cepacia) by strong hydrophobic interactions, and the effects of pore sizes on lipase distribution, relative activity, kinetic behavior, thermal stability, storage stability, and reusability were also investigated in detail. According to laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) observation, lipase penetrated into the center of those giga-/macro-porous microspheres. With regard to the mesoporous microspheres, lipase only adsorbed to the external shell. The relative activities of immobilized lipase were 146%, 126%, and 50.9% for giga-/macro-/meso-porous PST microspheres, respectively. Comparing with the kinetic constants of free lipase (0.441\u00a0mM), the Km value for mesoporous PST-lipase (0.532\u00a0mM) was higher, whereas for giga-/macro-porous PST-lipase (0.402\u00a0mM and 0.411\u00a0mM), the Km values were comparatively lower suggesting the accessibility of substrate to the enzyme active sites was unlimited. The thermal stability, storage stability, and reusability were all improved significantly with the increase of pore sizes. In stimulant system, even after 100 times of recycling, the activity of lipase immobilized on gigaporous and macroporous PST microspheres remained nearly 100% and 93%, respectively, while that of lipase-PST with 14.7\u00a0nm pores could only keep 64.1%. In real system, 73.5% and 68.8% activity of gigaporous PST-lipase and macroporous PST-lipase, respectively, were retained after being used 30 times, whereas only 49.4% activity was remained for mesoporous PST-lipase. Therefore, compared with other microspheres, the gigaporous PST microsphere exhibited obvious advantages as a potential enzyme support in industry.",

Both chemically modified and untreated enzyme were then immobilised onto SBA-15-, CNS- and MCM-type MPS by adsorption. Thermal stabilities of chemically modified CalB in solution and of the immobilised preparations were evaluated and compared. Citraconic anhydride dramatically reduced the stability of CalB whereas both bifunctionals yielded an eightfold increase in stability over the native free CalB at 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Following immobilisation of the EGNHS-treated preparation onto CNS-MPS, the stability gain increased to over 60-fold and this combination proved to be the most effective stabilisation strategy.

     "abstract": "In view of the heath problems induced by the presence into the environment of endocrine disruptors, laccase from Trametes versicolor was covalently immobilized on a chemically modified polypropylene membrane in order to remove phenol and its derivatives from polluted waters. Using phenol as substrate model the optimal immobilization conditions were determined. The immobilized laccase exhibited maximal enzyme activity at pH 5.5 and optimal temperature at 55\u00a0\u00b0C. These operative parameters have been compared with those obtained with the soluble laccase in order to ascertain the immobilization effect.When employed in a bioreactor operating under isothermal conditions the immobilized laccase was able to oxidize a wide range of phenolic substrates. In particular it was found that some phenol derivatives (2-CP, 3-CP, 4-CP, NP and chlorophene) were oxidized at a similar rate than phenol, other derivatives (paracetamol, 3-MP and chloroxyphenol) at a smaller rate, while others (2,4-DCP and BPA) at higher rate.When the catalytic membrane was employed in a non-isothermal reactor the reaction rate increased with the increase of the applied temperature difference. Practically the increase of the laccase oxidative power under the non-isothermal conditions followed the same sequence observed under isothermal conditions. Interesting enough, the percentage increase of enzyme reaction rate under non-isothermal conditions resulted higher in the cases in which the isothermal reaction rate was smaller.When the reduction of the production times by the presence of a temperature gradient is considered, the measured values strongly candidate the technology of non-isothermal bioreactors as a useful tool in processes of detoxification of waste waters polluted by endocrine disruptors of phenolic origin.",

For the production of l-Tle and l-HAG, BCAT from Enterobacter sp. TL3 (BCATen) and BCAT from Escherichia coli K12 (ilvE, newly named as BCATes) were used, respectively. In our current study, we characterized the basic properties of BCATen and BCATes such as substrate specificity, enantioselectivity, and kinetic parameters. The activities of BCATen and BCATes were inhibited severely by \u03b1-ketoglutarate which is a deaminated product of l-Glu. In the presence of 10\u00a0mM \u03b1-ketoglutarate, both enzymes activities were reduced up to 80%. In order to overcome product inhibition by \u03b1-ketoglutarate and the problem of equilibrium of the transamination reaction, coupling reactions were carried out with l-glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)/formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and AspAT.

The performances of CALB wt and mutants were compared to two other hydrolases, Humicola insolens cutinase and Rhizomucor mihei lipase. The low reaction rates of enzyme catalysed transacylation of acrylates were found to be caused mainly by electronic effects due to the double bond present in this class of molecules. The reduction in rate of enzyme catalysed transacylation of acrylates compared to that of the saturated ester methyl propionate was however less than what could be predicted from the energetic cost of breaking the \u03c0-system of acrylates solely.

Biocatalytic transglycosylation usually provides the desired glycosidic product in exquisite anomeric purity.

Kinetic studies and in situ proton NMR analysis of reaction time courses were used here to characterize glucosylation of substituted phenol acceptors by Leuconostoc mesenteroides sucrose phosphorylase in the presence of \u03b1-d-glucose 1-phosphate (\u03b1G1P) as donor substrate. In the wild-type enzyme, hydrolysis of the sugar 1-phosphate strongly prevailed (about 10-fold, \u223c1.6\u00a0U/mg) over glucosyl transfer to the 2,6-difluorophenol acceptor (\u223c0.17\u00a0U/mg) used. A mutated phosphorylase in which the catalytic acid\u2013base Glu237 had been replaced by Gln (E237Q) did not display hydrolase activity under transglucosylation conditions and therefore provided substantial (\u223c7-fold) enhancement of transfer yield.

     "abstract": "Metagenomic DNA is a rich source of genes encoding novel epoxide hydrolases (EHs). We retrieved two genes encoding functional EHs from total DNA isolated from biofilter-derived biomass, using PCR with EH-specific degenerate primers followed by genome-walking PCR. The degenerate primers were based on two EH-specific consensus sequences: HGWP and GHDWG. The resulting recombinant EHs, Kau2 and Kau8, were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their enantioselectivity and regioselectivity were determined using 13 different epoxide substrates. The EH Kau2 had broad substrate specificity and preferentially hydrolyzed epoxides with S-configuration. It showed high enantioselectivity towards aromatic epoxides such as styrene oxide, p-nitrostyrene oxide, and trans-1-phenyl-1,2-epoxypropane. In addition, Kau2 showed enantioconvergent hydrolysis activity. The EH Kau8 also showed broad substrate specificity and preferentially hydrolyzed epoxides with R-configuration. High enantioselectivity was observed for p-nitrostyrene oxide, and the hydrolysis activity of Kau8 was less enantioconvergent than that of Kau2. To determine the usefulness of Kau2 for synthetic applications, preparative-scale biohydrolysis reactions were performed. Specifically, two kinetic resolutions were carried out with 80\u00a0g/L of racemic trans-1-phenyl-1,2-epoxypropane, affording both (1R,2R)-epoxide and the corresponding (1R,2S)-diol in high enantiomeric excess (>99%) and good yield (>45%). In addition, a process based on enantioconvergent hydrolysis by the EH Kau2 was established for racemic cis-1-phenyl-1,2-epoxypropane at a concentration of 13\u00a0g/L, resulting in the formation of the corresponding (1R,2R)-diol with a 97% yield and an enantiomeric excess exceeding 98%.",

In order to circumvent this problem, the enzyme was chemically modified by cations usually present in ionic liquids: cholinium (1), hydroxyethyl-methylimidazolium (2) and hydroxypropyl-methylimidazolium (3) cations were activated with carbonyldiimidazole before being reacted with the FDH leading to a heterogeneous population of 6\u20137 biocatalysts.

To overcome the low solubility of naringin in the enzymatic reaction media, the effect of different solvents was studied, in order to improve the productivity and yield of the system. The effect of increasing concentration of co-solvents on the stability of both soluble and immobilized naringinase expressing \u03b1-l-rhamnosidase and \u03b2-d-glucosidase activities was evaluated. The enzyme was immobilized onto sol\u2013gel matrices of tetramethoxysilane and glycerol. Combining the higher naringin solubility, and the higher residual activity of both \u03b1-l-rhamnosidase and \u03b2-d-glucosidase expressed by naringinase, eight solvents were chosen for stability and activity studies: dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylmethanamide, methanol, ethanol, acetone, tetrahydrofurane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane and 1,4-dioxane.Deactivation of soluble naringinase was analyzed according to a first-order kinetic model.

To a better understanding of these effects on naringinase enzyme complex, they were also evaluated over \u03b1-l-rhamnosidase and \u03b2-d-glucosidase activities, using specific substrates, p-nitrophenyl \u03b1-l-rhamnopyranoside (4-NRham) and p-nitrophenyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (4-NGluc), respectively.

A 3-fold and 4-fold increase on naringinase thermostability was observed under 150\u00a0MPa at 70 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, compared to 0.1\u00a0MPa experiments. In addition, a 15-fold increase of kcat/kM values from experimental conditions of 0.1\u00a0MPa and 30\u00a0\u00b0C to 150\u00a0MPa and 70\u00a0\u00b0C was observed.

After 24-h reaction at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, molar incorporation of oleic acid was about 27% for all the commercial lipases tested and 9% with C. parapsilosis enzyme. Concerning omega-3 PUFA, the highest incorporations were observed with Novozym 435 (21.6%) and Lipozyme RM IM (20%), in contrast with C. parapsilosis enzyme (8.5%) and Lipozyme TL IM (8.2%). In system I, Lipozyme RM IM maintained its activity for 10 repeated 23-h batches while for Lipozyme TL IM, Novozym 435 and C. parapsilosis enzyme, linear (half-life time, t1/2\u00a0=\u00a0154\u00a0h), series-type (t1/2\u00a0=\u00a0253\u00a0h) and first-order (t1/2\u00a0=\u00a034.5\u00a0h) deactivations were respectively observed. In system II, Lipozyme RM IM showed linear deactivation (t1/2\u00a0=\u00a0276\u00a0h), while Novozym 435 (t1/2\u00a0=\u00a0322\u00a0h) and C. parapsilosis enzyme (t1/2\u00a0=\u00a0127\u00a0h), presented series-type deactivation.

In order to increase the number of their applications it is useful to shed light on the reasons that cause a non-optimal activity of these enzymes when used in inactivating experimental conditions (e.g., in the presence of co-solvent to favor substrate dissolution). To this end the effect of different mono alcohols on the activity and the conformation of alkaline protease from Bacillus clausii GMBAE 42 was investigated. We found that the enzyme in the presence of 20\u201325% of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol or 2-propanol halves its activity. At the concentration of 10%, all the alcohols caused a slightly more intense far-UV (CD) circular dichroism signal of the protease at around 208 and 220\u00a0nm with respect to the protein in only buffer, which suggests an increase of helicity in the secondary structure of the protein. Monitoring the shift of the fluorescence emission of the protease with respect to that of the standard N-acetyl-l-tryptophan-ethyl ester, we suggest that with all the alcohols tested the decrease of activity might be due to the loss of tertiary structure (even though at a lower extents in methanol and ethanol compared to 1-propanol and 2-propanol).",

     "abstract": "An amperometric biosensor for the detection of polyphenols in wine has been developed immobilizing the two enzymes Tyrosinase and Laccase on graphite screen printed electrodes modified with ferrocene. Different immobilization procedures have been carried out, the sensor operational parameters have been optimized, determining the best conditions and the analytical method for the analysis of samples. The biosensor has been then tested with real samples, using wines and musts supplied by Astra, experimental winery, in Imola (Italy). The biosensor gave good results when employed for wine analysis, showing a good agreement with the spectrophotometric data obtained with the Folin-Ciocalteu test, the official method for polyphenols\u2019 analysis in wine. On the other hand, the measurements on musts and wines recently bottled, were seriously affected by the presence of an high level of free sulphur dioxide. SO2 is the likely responsible for enzyme activity inhibition on the sensor. Further studies are currently proceeding to find out the most suitable conditions to obtain results not influenced by the presence of sulphur dioxide.",

Although this lipase was initially produced to be used in food industry, in this review we will focus our attention on the application of this enzyme in organic chemistry, from biodiesel production to fine chemicals (mainly in enantio or regioselective or specific processes). After showing the enzyme features, some of the most efficient methods of RML immobilization will be commented (entrapping on reverse micelles, preparation of cross-linked RML aggregates or immobilization on pre-existing solids). Finally, the main uses of the enzyme in organic chemistry will be revised. The use of RML in the production of biodiesel will be analyzed, and compared to the performance of other lipases. The synthesis of esters of carboxylic acids as flavors is other example where RML has been successfully employed. Taking advantage of the wide specificity of the enzyme, mainly a high enantiospecificity, many examples of the use of RML in the resolution of racemic mixtures of chiral carboxylic acids, alcohols or esters will be presented. Special mention requires the use of the regioselectivity of RML, mainly the chemistry of sugars. Finally, more unusual uses of RML will be presented (anomalous substrates, novel uses, etc.). In general, this enzyme seems very adequate for esterification reactions due to its high stability in anhydrous media and good esterification activity.",

Hydrogen peroxide was utilized as source of electrons and oxygen to support the monooxygenase activity of BM3H_F87A. The mesoporous materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption analyses before and after immobilization. The results revealed that the immobilization efficiency of MCM-41 and SBA-15 after single immersion was strongly affected by the pH value of the enzyme solution, initial enzyme concentration and agitation conditions. By modelling the 3D structure in silico and performing electrostatic potential calculations, the pH-dependence of the enzyme immobilization could be explained and a possible orientation of the protein on mesoporous materials was predicted. The oxidizing activity of the immobilized enzyme was found to depend on pore diameter and accessibility of the substrate for the enzyme. The highest activity toward 12-pNCA of 830\u00a0nmol product/mg P450/min was observed with BM3H_F87A immobilized on SBA-15 with pore diameter 133\u00a0\u00c5. Enzyme activity toward n-octane was similar for the enzyme immobilized on SBA-15 of 60\u00a0\u00c5 and 133\u00a0\u00c5, and was at least two-fold higher as compared to a system with free enzyme.",

     "abstract": "The potential of enzyme catalysis as a tool for organic synthesis is nowadays indisputable, as is the fact that organic solvents affect an enzyme's activity, selectivity and stability. Moreover, it was recently realized that an enzyme's initial activity is substantially decreased after prolonged exposure to organic media, an effect that further hampers their potential as catalysts for organic synthesis. Regrettably, the mechanistic reasons for these effects are still debatable. In the present study we have made an attempt to explain the reasons behind the partial loss of enzyme activity on prolonged exposure to organic solvents. Fluorescence spectroscopic studies of the serine protease subtilisin Carlsberg chemically modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG-SC) and inhibited with a dansyl fluorophore, and dissolved in two organic solvents (acetonitrile and 1,4-dioxane) indicate that when the enzyme is initially introduced into these solvents, the active site environment is similar to that in water; however prolonged exposure to the organic medium causes this environment to resemble that of the solvent in which the enzyme is dissolved. Furthermore, kinetic studies show a reduction on both Vmax and KM as a result of prolonged exposure to the solvents. One interpretation of these results is that during this prolonged exposure to organic solvents the active-site fluorescent label inhibitor adopts a different binding conformation. Extrapolating this to an enzymatic reaction we argue that substrates bind in a less catalytically favorable conformation after the enzyme has been exposed to organic media for several hours.",

In this work we investigate the effect of water miscible alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol) on activity and quaternary structure of this thermophilic enzyme. The enzyme activity of NOX was studied in a broad range (0\u201360%) of alcohol concentrations. In all studied alcohols, NOX displays optimum activity at low alcohol concentration (<20%). Under these conditions, the enzyme catalytic efficiency (kcat,app/KM,app) significantly increases mainly due to \u223c10-fold increase of the catalytic constant. At high alcohol concentrations (>30%), NOX activity is time dependent and slowly diminished with an apparent time constant of several hours. We found that prolonged incubation in the presence of alcohols results in: (i) dissociation of the homodimeric native structure of the enzyme and (ii) release of catalytically essential flavin cofactor from the intermonomer interface. The inactivation is fully reversible on increasing enzyme concentration and NOX activity is completely recovered even in the presence of high alcohol concentrations. Moreover, exogenous addition of the flavin cofactor dramatically stabilizes dimeric form of the enzyme and results in shift of apparent Kd to the lower values. Theoretical simulations showed that flavin dissociation and monomer/dimer equilibria are strongly coupled.",

     "abstract": "Arginine kinase (AK, EC 2.7.3.3) is a phosphagen kinase widely distributed in lower and higher invertebrates. Sabellastarte indica AKs (AK1 and AK2) are the only AKs that use d-arginine in addition to l-arginine as a substrate. S. indica AKs are therefore clearly unrelated to typical AK. The purpose of this work was to identify the amino acid residues responsible for distinguishing the chirality of d- and l-arginine. The three-dimensional structure of Sabellastarte AK2 was predicted using the SWISS-MODEL automated modeling server. Two amino acids, L64 in the N-terminal flexible loop and N320 in the C-terminal flexible loop, were found to be closest to the substrate arginine. We introduced several mutations around the predicted binding site of the substrate arginine. In the L64I mutant, the affinity for l-arginine was greatly increased (9.5-fold that of the wild-type), whereas its affinity for d-arginine was increased 2.9-fold, indicating that the L64I mutant enzyme was more specific for l-arginine. On the other hand, the L64V mutant showed a 1.7-fold decrease in affinity for l-arginine, but unchanged affinity for d-arginine. Thus the L64V mutant enzyme was more specific for d-arginine. Since the replacement of amino acid residue L64 by I or V significantly affected the affinity for l-arginine or d-arginine, it can be concluded that amino acid 64 is a key residue for distinguishing d- and l-arginine. Seven mutants at position 320 (N320H, Q, D, E, R, K and A) had considerably reduced enzymatic activity (0.05\u201352% of the wild-type). The reduction in enzyme activity was more significant when d-arginine was the substrate rather than l-arginine, except for N320D, suggesting that the carbonyl oxygen of the Asn320 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the \u03b1-amino nitrogen attached to the asymmetric carbon of the d-arginine substrate. In addition, we found that even a residue remote from the guanidino substrate-binding site, such as G54 and Y89 in Sabellastarte AK2, significantly affected guanidino substrate specificity.",

The synthetic activity and the ratio of the synthetic activity to the hydrolytic activity were significantly affected by amino acid substitutions at positions 181, 266 and 370. The synthetic activity was enhanced to 2.7\u00a0U/mg by G181D-H266N substitutions, and the activity was further enhanced in the G181D-H266N-D370Y triple mutant to a level approximately 104-fold greater than the parental carboxylesterase form (3.4\u00a0U/mg), which was nearly equal to the ordinary hydrolytic activity in water (type A-mutants). Type A-mutants possessed more than 50% of the 6-aminohexanoate-linear dimer (Ald)-hydrolytic activity at 0\u201370% tert-butyl alcohol, but the synthetic reaction became predominant at 85\u201390% tert-butyl alcohol. In contrast, type B-mutants (G181E-H266N and G181N-H266N) possessed quite low levels of Ald-hydrolytic activity (<0.01\u00a0U/mg) at 0\u201370% tert-butyl alcohol. However, both the hydrolytic and synthetic activities were enhanced at higher concentrations, and the maximum activity was obtained at 90% tert-butyl alcohol for both hydrolysis and synthesis. In a type C-mutant (R187S-F264C-D370Y), the Ald-hydrolytic activity was enhanced to approximately 80-fold that of the parental carboxylesterase, but the mutant barely demonstrated any synthetic activity. On the basis of the three-dimensional structure of the Ald-bound enzyme and a kinetic study for typical mutant enzymes, we propose that the efficient enzymatic syntheses of nylon-6 units were achieved by (i) stable binding of the 1st-Ahx at the N-terminal region with Asp181, (ii) interaction of the 2nd-Ahx at the C-terminal region with Tyr370, and (iii) motion of Tyr170 that generated a closed form in the catalytic center of Ald hydrolase.",

Preliminary tests for the activity of immobilized AChE were carried out using these three methods. The third method was selected as the most efficient one for the immobilization of AChE and the prepared enzyme carriers were used for the construction of amperometric biosensors for the detection of acetylthiocholine (ATCh).A five level three factorial central composite design was chosen to determine the optimal conditions for the enzyme immobilization with three critical variables: concentration of enzyme, Concanavalin A and MWCNs. The design illustrated that the optimum values of the factors influencing the amperometric current were CE: 70\u00a0U\u00a0mL\u22121; CCon A: 1.5\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121 and CMWCN: 11\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121, with an amperometric current 0.418\u00a0\u03bcA. The basic amperometric characteristics of the constructed biosensor were investigated. A calibration plot was obtained for a series of ATCh concentrations ranging from 5 to 400\u00a0\u03bcM. A linear interval was detected along the calibration curve from 5 to 200\u00a0\u03bcM. The correlation coefficient for this concentration range was 0.995.

     "abstract": "Aspergillus niger lipases are important biocatalysts for a broad range of industrial applications. To enhance the expression level of a newly cloned lipase gene lip2 of A. niger in Pichia pastoris, we applied codon optimization and synthesized the full length codon-optimized gene by a two-step gene synthesis strategy. This strategy consists of an assembly PCR for several small DNA fragments and enzymatic digestion and ligation steps to ligate these fragments into the full-length gene. First, the full-length lip2 gene was divided into three fragments F1 (237\u00a0bp), F2 (238\u00a0bp) and F3 (422\u00a0bp) with the additions of proper restriction sites, and separately amplified by assembly PCR reactions. Second, three PCR amplified fragments were digested and ligated into the full-length lip2 gene. In the two-step gene synthesis, synthesis of smaller DNA fragments resulted in a significant lower level of nonspecific mismatching among oligonucleotides and a very low mutational rate of the PCR products, demonstrating the superiority of the method. When compared with the originally cloned lip2 gene of A. niger, the new codon optimized lip2 gene expressed at a significantly higher level in yeasts after methanol induction for 72\u00a0h, and both the enzyme activity and protein content reached maximal levels of 191\u00a0U/ml and 154\u00a0mg/1, with 11.6- and 5.3-fold increases, respectively.",

Despite the potential use of mammalian P450s in various fields of biotechnology, these enzymes are not suitable as biocatalysts due to their low stability, low catalytic activity, and limited availability. Recently, wild-type and mutant forms of bacterial P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium have been found to metabolize various. It has therefore been suggested that CYP102A1 may be used to generate the metabolites of drugs and drug candidates. In this report, we show that the oxidation reactions of typical human CYP1A2 substrates (phenacetin, ethoxyresorufin, and methoxyresorufin) are catalyzed by both wild-type and mutant forms of CYP102A1. In the case of phenacetin, CYP102A1 enzymes show only O-deethylation product, even though two major products are produced as a result of O-deethylation and 3-hydroxylation reactions by human CYP1A2. Formation of the metabolites was confirmed by HPLC analysis and LC\u2013MS to compare the metabolites with the actual biological metabolites produced by human CYP1A2. The results demonstrate that CYP102A1 mutants can be used for cost-effective and scalable production of human CYP1A2 drug metabolites. Our computational findings suggest that a conformational change in the cavity size of the active sites of the mutants is dependent on activity change. The modeling results further suggest that the activity change results from the movement of several specific residues in the active sites of the mutants.",

The gene has an open reading frame of 1860\u00a0base pairs and encodes a 620 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of about 65\u00a0kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated that Bgl1T and other putative \u03b2-glucoside-specific II ABC subunit components, were closely related. Functional characterization with a high performance liquid chromatography method demonstrated that the recombinant Bgl1T protein hydrolyzed d-(+)-cellobiose to glucose. The maximum activity for Bgl1T protein occurred at pH 7.0 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C using p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-glucoside as the substrate. The putative \u03b2-glucosidase had an apparent Km value of 1.45\u00a0mM, a Vmax value of 20.5\u00a0U/mg, a kcat value of 1370/min and a kcat/Km value of 943/mM/min.

     "abstract": "Acyl migration phenomenon was often observed during 1,3-positional specificity lipase-catalyzed reactions from triglycerides and partial glycerides, including acyl migration of 1,2-diglyceride (1,2-DG) to 1,3-diglyceride (1,3-DG) and 2-monoglyceride (2-MG) to 1-monoglyceride (1-MG). However, the acyl migration mechanism and kinetics were seldom studied despite of numerous researches on process optimization of 1,3-positional specificity lipase-catalyzed reaction. In this paper, the influence of related factors on acyl migration process as well as their influencing mechanism was further studied. It was found that temperature and water activity were two crucial factors that would influence acyl migration kinetics. Determination of the kinetic parameters under different temperatures revealed that the acyl migration reaction rates were greatly promoted by the increasing of temperature. The acyl migration rates of 1,2-diglyceride and 2-monoglyceride were quite different from each other, which was found to be due to the different activation energies. Further study of how would water influence the acyl migration process showed that water activity rather than water content was a key factor that influenced acyl migration and the acyl migration rate would decrease with the increase of water activity. It was further revealed that water activity influenced the charge dispersion of the transition state, which ultimately influenced the reaction activation energy and then influenced the acyl migration rate.",

The initial rate of PEL-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) was 12-fold enhanced in the ionic liquid. The optimal water content required by PEL in [BMIm][PF6] was 10 times higher relative to that in hexane due to the greater polarity of the ionic liquid. Direct addition of salt hydrates into the two nonaqueous reaction media showed different impacts on the enzyme activity, which could be related to the dual functions of the salt hydrates, i.e., the water buffering effect, and the specific ion effect (Hofmeister effect). The transesterification activity of PEL was reflected by the yield of producing fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in the methanolysis of corn oil for 25\u00a0h, which was 69.7% in [BMIm][PF6], as compared to 19.4%, 14.0%, and 1.0% obtained in tert-butanol, solvent-free system, and hexane, respectively.

The choice of the reaction medium allowed the regioselective formation of products bearing different degree of acetylation: in isopropanol, CAL-B catalysed the formation of the corresponding 2\u2032-O-acetylated arabinonucleosides, while hydrolyses afforded the 2\u2032,3\u2032-di-O-acetylated products. In particular, the procedure herein described allows a simple and efficient preparation of the reported vidarabine prodrug 2\u2032,3\u2032-di-O-acetyl-9-\u03b2-d-arabinofuranosyladenine, avoiding the utilisation of protective groups. Moreover, to achieve full deacetylation of the assayed substrates, a set of commercial hydrolases and fungal keratinases from Doratomyces microsporus (DMK) and Paecilomyces marquandii (PMK) were tested. While only PMK and DMK catalysed the quantitative complete deacetylation of 1, DMK accomplished full deacetylation of 2 in shorter time than the other assayed enzymes.",

Based on the ABTS-bound crystal structure of CotA, 19 amino acids are within 6\u00a0\u00c5 of ABTS, and they were simultaneously randomized. A mutant was identified that was 132 times more specific for ABTS. Unexpectedly, the variant was found to acquire enhanced thermal stability. The half-life for the heat inactivation (t1/2) at 80\u00a0\u00b0C was increased by 62\u00a0min for the mutant. Laccases have several applications in biotechnology, which include pulp bleaching, biosensors, bioremediation, and biofuel cells.

We achieved preferential chemical modification of the non-catalytic domain of endoinulinase (EC 3.2.1.7) to enhance the thermostability of the enzyme. We used pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP) to modify the more accessible lysine residues at the surface of endoinulinase and then performed a necessary step of reduction with ascorbate. Endoinulinase was incubated in the presence of PLP at various concentrations; this step was followed by reduction of the resulting Schiff base and dialysis. The effects of different PLP concentrations and incubation times on enzyme modification were evaluated. Enzyme deactivation was observed immediately after treatment, even at low PLP concentrations, while reactivation was observed for samples treated with low PLP concentrations after a period of time. Structural analysis revealed that the \u03b1-helix content increased from 13.60% to 17.60% after applying the modification strategy; consequently, enzyme stabilization was achieved. The melting temperature (Tm) of the modified enzyme increased from 64.1\u00a0\u00b0C to 72.2\u00a0\u00b0C, and a comparative study of thermal stability at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, 45\u00a0\u00b0C, and 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 150\u00a0min confirmed that the enzyme was stabilized because of increase in its half-life (t1/2) after PLP modification/ascorbate reduction. The modification process was optimized to achieve the optimum mole ratio for the PLP/endoinulinase (1.37). Excess moles of the modifier are thought to be responsible for enzyme deactivation through unwanted/nonspecific and noncovalent interactions, and the optimization ensured that there was no excess modifier after the desired covalent reaction was complete.",

The demands of a high amount of lipase as well as the long reaction time are caused by the low reactivity of the carboxylic group and the formation of salt with the amine.

The in silico results also indicate that different PBMs of the slow-reacting enantiomer do exist in one lipase even when there is little structural differences between substrates, e.g. compounds with Ph or CH2CH2Ph group display the M/H permutation type PBM while molecules with CH2Ph show the M/L permutation type PBM. By relating the PBMs of substrates to the experimentally determined E-values obtained by Hoff et al.

Stabilization with respect to T, pH and the presence of organic solvent was observed as well as, unlike the solubilized enzyme, the adsorbed lipase was active at T\u00a0>\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C, at pH 5 and after 24-h incubation with 70% (v/v) methanol (13% residual activity).",

     "abstract": "Passing a nitrogen stream over a preparation of oxy-tyrosinase (Eox) gives rise to the relaxed deoxy-tyrosinase form ( E d R ) , which, under anaerobic conditions, slowly transforms into tense deoxy-tyrosinase ( E d T ) . In the presence of oxygen, regeneration of the form Eox from E d R is rapid but from E d T it is a slow process. However, when two substrates (oxygen/o-diphenol or oxygen/monophenol) are simultaneously added, both the E d R and E d T forms rapidly revert to the active Eox form, pointing to a synergistic effect of both substrates. However, the activity obtained in the case of E d T is less than that of the native enzyme and of the enzyme that can be generated rapidly by pre-incubation with oxygen of the E d R recently formed by passage of the nitrogen stream, or that generated slowly by pre-incubating the E d T form with oxygen. Although the Vmax of the forms E d R and E d T are very similar, the Michaelis constant of the latter is higher. The kinetic properties of E d R are similar to those of the native enzyme. The behaviour of the monophenols is similar to that of the o-diphenols, although, while the latter inactivate the enzyme under anaerobic conditions, the former protect it from inactivation. The pH affects the transition from E d R to E d T , which is more rapid at pH 6.5, at which value the kinetic properties of the native enzyme and of E d T are similar and the oxygenation step in which E d T regenerates Eox is more rapid. At pH values other than 6.5, the transition of E d R to E d T takes place slowly. From a study of the effect of pH on the transition of E d R to E d T and of the re-oxygenation of E d T to Eox, the possible existence of two apparent pKas, with approximate values of 6.0 and 6.8, may be surmised. At high pH, the enzyme contains two acid/base groups carrying negative charges, which repel (pH\u00a0>\u00a06.8) or two positive charges (at pH\u00a0<\u00a06.0), which also repel, while at \u223cpH 6.5 one positive and one negative group exists, which prevents the separation of the two copper atoms.",

Molecular sieves, generally used to control the water content during acylation reactions, turned out to have an important role in this. It was proven that molecular sieves alone can catalyze the acylation of fructose oligomers using vinyl laurate, leading to multiple substitution of the oligomers. This effect was the most profound at conditions unfavorable for the enzyme, because this resulted in a relatively high concentration of the chemically produced adducts. The enzyme alone catalyzed the formation of monosubstituted oligomers. It was proven that even solvent pre-drying by molecular sieves already causes the release of catalyzing compounds to the liquid, leading to subsequent catalysis. These findings should be taken into account when applying molecular sieves in this type of reactions in the future. Molecular sieves could, moreover, be used as a catalyst when multiple substitution is desired.",

The central reaction in the biodiesel production is the transesterification reaction which could be catalyzed either chemically or enzymatically. Enzymatic transesterification has certain advantages over the chemical catalysis of transesterification, as it is less energy intensive, allows easy recovery of glycerol and the transesterification of glycerides with high free fatty acid contents. Limitations of the enzyme catalyzed reactions include high cost of enzyme, low yield, high reaction time and the amount of water and organic solvents in the reaction mixture. Researchers have been trying to overcome these limitations in the enzyme catalyzed transesterification reaction. This paper is meant to review the latest development in the field of lipase catalyzed transesterification of biologically derived oil to produce biodiesel.",

Under these conditions, THL was found to be a potent HPL inhibitor. After being dissolved in the pure triglyceride phase (method D), THL also strongly inhibited HPL. However, with TC4 as substrate TLL was efficiently inhibited by THL only when method C was used and not method D. The very different inhibitory effects on HPL and TLL recorded with method D and PSO as substrate were confirmed using the monomolecular film and oil drop techniques.With a monomolecular film of dicaprin (di-C10) as substrate, 1 molecule of THL embedded in 400\u00a0000 molecules of di-C10 sufficed to reduce the HPL activity to half of its initial value.HPL was therefore efficiently inhibited by THL with all the methods and substrates tested here. Paradoxically, TLL was inhibited by THL molecules transiently present in the aqueous phase and not by the THL molecules present at the triglyceride/water interface. It should therefore be stressed that the inhibitory effects of THL on each lipase depend strongly on the method and the substrate used.",

The sensitivity of the constructed biosensor was calculated to be 0.066\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0\u03bcM\u22121\u00a0cm\u22122. The correlation coefficient for this concentration range was 0.996. The detection limit with regard to ATCh was calculated to be 1.80\u00a0\u03bcM.The potential application of the biosensor for detection and quantification of organophosphate pesticides was investigated as well. It was tested against sample solutions of Paraoxon. The biosensor detection limit for Paraoxon was determined, 7.39\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211\u00a0g\u00a0l\u22121, as well as the concentration interval (10\u221210 to 10\u22127\u00a0g\u00a0l\u22121) within which the biosensor response was linearly dependant on Paraoxon concentration.Finally the storage stability of the enzyme carrier was traced for a period of 50 days. After storage for 20 days the sensor retained 75% of its initial current response and after 30 days \u221225%.",

     "abstract": "Herbimycin A, a typically water-insoluble anti-tumor drug and an analog of geldanamycin, was transformed by fungus Eupenicillium sp. SD017. The water solubility and anti-tumor activity of converted products were evaluated after separation, purification, and structure elucidation. The results showed that herbimycin A can be converted into herbimycin C 1 and 11-hydroxy-(11-demethoxy)-herbimycin C 2 with water solubility increased. The latter is a novel compound, and its IC50 to A549, MCF-7, Ehrlich and HeLa cells is 152.9, 0.46, 10.7 and 109.3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively, which are nearly in the range of those between herbimycin A and herbimycin C. It is suggested that an O-demethylase or/and methyltransferase may play an important role on biotransformation in this case. This study will firstly serve as a fundamental methodology for further structural alteration and functional improvement of the water-insoluble anti-tumor drugs using microbial resources.",

Under the experimental conditions, up to 70\u00a0mol% of the acyl donor methyl acrylate was converted. Methyl methacrylate is the less efficient acyl donor (up to 60\u00a0mol%) due to the higher sterical hindrance in the enzymatic transacylation. Under the reaction conditions high yields of the mono-acylated products are obtained, which contain minor amounts of bis(meth)acrylates. In addition it was observed that Novozyme 435 catalyzes regioselectively the acylation of the primary hydroxyl groups. In comparison with the chemical catalyzed route no selectivity was observed for unsubstituted diols. For substituted diols more mono-acylated product was formed in the lipase-catalyzed reaction than in the chemical catalyzed reaction.",

     "abstract": "To improve the production of biodiesel by enzymatic conversion of triglycerides in cottonseed oil, compatible solutes were added to the solvent-free methanolysis system to prevent competitive methanol inhibition on the immobilized lipase (Novozym\u00ae 435). The results indicated that the addition of ectoine increased biodiesel synthesis using a three-step methanol addition process. The concentration of methyl ester (ME) reached a maximum of 95.0% in the presence of 1.1\u00a0mmol/l ectoine, an increase of 20.9% compared to that in the absence of ectoine. On the other hand, excess ectoine decreased the ME concentration. Ectoine was also shown to enhance reuse of the immobilized lipase, significantly improving ME concentrations in each recycling test. Total concentrations of ME with added ectoine were about 1.5 times that without ectoine during five recycling tests (molar ratio of cottonseed oil to methanol, 1:4). Enzymatic reaction kinetics showed, in the concentration ranges of 0.8\u20131.14\u00a0mol/l and 0.03\u20138\u00a0mol/l for triglyceride and methanol, respectively, that ectoine had no effect on the initial reaction rates when methanol concentrations were below 0.5\u00a0mol/l. When methanol concentration exceeded 0.5\u00a0mol/l, the addition of 0.8\u00a0mmol/l ectoine increased the initial reaction rates, and the lipase exhibited a lower affinity for methanol and higher affinity for triglyceride (kinetic parameters of KmA increase, KmTG decrease). However, the initial reaction rates decreased significantly when 8\u00a0mmol/l ectoine was added, with the lipase having higher affinity for methanol and lower affinity for triglyceride (KmA decrease, KmTG increase). The supplementation of ectoine provided a new method for the purpose of improving yield of biodiesel catalyzed by enzyme.",

     "abstract": "The present work involves the use of p-tert-butylcalix[4,6,8]arene carboxylic acid derivatives (tButyl[4,6,8]CH2COOH) for selective extraction of hemoglobin. All three calixarenes extracted hemoglobin into the organic phase, exhibiting extraction parameters higher than 0.90. Evaluation of the solvent accessible positively charged amino acid side chains of hemoglobin (PDB entry 1XZ2) revealed that there are 8 arginine, 44 lysine and 30 histidine residues on the protein surface which may be involved in the interactions with the calixarene molecules. The hemoglobin\u2013tButyl[6]CH2COOH complex had pseudoperoxidase activity which catalysed the oxidation of syringaldazine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in organic medium containing chloroform. The effect of pH, protein and substrate concentrations on biocatalysis was investigated using the hemoglobin\u2013tButyl[6]CH2COOH complex. This complex exhibited the highest specific activity of 9.92\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0U\u00a0mg\u00a0protein\u22121 at an initial pH of 7.5 in organic medium. Apparent kinetic parameters (V\u2032max, K\u2032m, k\u2032cat and k\u2032cat/K\u2032m) for the pseudoperoxidase activity were determined in organic media for different pH values from a Michaelis\u2013Menten plot. Furthermore, the stability of the protein\u2013calixarene complex was investigated for different initial pH values and half-life (t1/2) values were obtained in the range of 1.96 and 2.64 days. Hemoglobin\u2013calixarene complex present in organic medium was recovered in fresh aqueous solutions at alkaline pH, with a recovery of pseudoperoxidase activity of over 100%. These results strongly suggest that the use of calixarene derivatives is an alternative technique for protein extraction and solubilisation in organic media for biocatalysis.",
