     "abstract": "This paper reported a novel catalyst CuO/graphene oxide (CuO/GO) for the efficient amination of benzene to aniline, with NH3\u00b7H2O as the aminating agent and H2O2 as the oxidant. The catalysts were characterized by ICP-AES, XRD, TEM, and FTIR. It was found that 30\u202fwt% CuO/GO exhibited excellent and steady activity in the reaction of benzene to aniline, and the yield of aniline was 77.3% and selectivity to aniline was 99.2%.

In this method, zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-67 is used as structural template for the preparation of a mesoporous metal oxide shell as well as sacrificial precursor to form Co3O4 nanoparticles inside the shell. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of a carbonization step prior to the final calcination can decrease the required calcination temperature from 550\u202f\u00b0C to 300\u202f\u00b0C. This has a large effect on the dispersion and catalytic activity of Co3O4 for CO oxidation and decreases the light-of temperature (temperature at 50% conversion) from 160\u202f\u00b0C to 134\u202f\u00b0C. Exploiting metal-organic frameworks as both structural template and sacrificial precursor offers precise control of size, shape and structure and opens up new exiting opportunities for design of advanced nanostructured catalysts.",

Au nanoparticle cocatalyst remarkably enhances photocatalytic activity of C3N4 for H2O2 production. Due to the inert nature to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2, Au/C3N4 also exhibits stable H2O2 evolution rate. It is of great interest that the maximal H2O2 production activity is reached at the loading amount of Au as low as 0.01%, revealing the great catalytic efficacy of highly dispersed Au cocatalyst during the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis and the possibility to produce concentrated H2O2 using C3N4 with extremely low Au loading amount.

The proposed method improves the dispersibility of Mo12O30(\u03bc2-OH)10H2[Co(H2O)3]4 (Co4Mo12) on Al2O3 by hydrothermal deposition. Direct sulfurization without calcination weakens the metal-support interaction and improves the stacking of MoS2 slabs. Furthermore, the intimate contact between Co and Mo atoms and the high Co/Mo ratio in Co4Mo12 guarantee a high concentration of active CoMoS phases. Consequently, the Co4Mo12-based catalyst presents higher activity for dibenzothiophene (DBT) HDS than do its counterparts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation.",

The difference between the two catalysts lies in that the PANDF contains hydrogen bond network while the PANTF does not. Employing Knoevenagel condensation as a model reaction, the cooperative action of immobilized tertiary amines with hydrogen bonds was evaluated in detail. At the same time, the aggregation of reactants in the polar microenvironment under different solvents was also investigated. The results showed that hydrogen bonds and the supporting basic groups can promote the reaction by the synergistic catalytic effect in most solvents. The catalysts displayed different catalytic behaviors in solvents with different polarities. The catalysts can achieve highly efficient catalytic activity in the more polar solvents which were well compatible with the catalysts.

The catalyst is effective for internal and terminal alkynes and showed high functional group compatibility. A low catalyst loading, low temperature and shorter duration of photolysis are ideal feature of reaction. The catalyst can be reused several times under aerobic and aqueous conditions, exemplifying the robust nature of the catalyst.

     "abstract": "For the first time, nitrogen-doped TiO2 was successfully synthesized by a novel single-step flame aerosol method. Our XPS and EDX results illustrate that the nitrogen was effectively doped into the crystal lattice of TiO2 in our as-synthesized N-TiO2 catalysts predominantly in the form of interstitial nitrogen (Ti\u2212O\u2212N) rather than substitutional nitrogen (Ti\u2212N). The shift of the (101) plane anatase diffraction peaks to lower angles in our N-doped TiO2 catalysts compared to pristine TiO2 revealed the distortion and strain in the crystal lattice instigated by the incorporation of the nitrogen atoms. The growth or expansion of crystal lattice can be attributed to the larger atomic radius of respective nitrogen atoms (r\u202f=\u202f1.71\u202f\u00c5) compared to oxygen (r\u202f=\u202f1.40\u202f\u00c5). Our single-step rapid aerosol synthesis method directs the nitrogen atoms mainly occupy interstitial positions in TiO2 lattice. This occurrence narrows the band gap of TiO2 (from 3.12 to ~2.51\u202feV) in our N-doped TiO2. The lowering of band-gap energy for our flame-made N-doped TiO2 materials indicates that the nitrogen doping in TiO2 by aerosol method is highly effective in achieving a red-shift on adsorption to potentially make use of the energy of visible light. The presence of high amount interstitial nitrogen would modify the band structure and suppress the recombination efficiency of the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs, resulting in enriched photocatalytic ability of TiO2 under solar environment or visible irradiation. The incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the lattice structure of TiO2 modifies the electronic band structure of titania, which leads to a new mid-gap energy state N 2p band formed above O 2p valance band. The photocatalytic degradation of phenol as a probe reaction was used to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of the as-synthesized N-doped materials under visible light.",

In the present work, Cu-Mg-Al-Ox mixed metal oxides and Cu/Al2O3 active catalysts in NH3-SCO were investigated under NH3/O2/CO2/H2O/N2 reaction conditions.

Cu-Mg-Al-Ox hydrotalcite derived mixed metal oxides were obtained by coprecipitation, while Cu/Al2O3 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. A highly dispersed copper oxide species formed on Cu-Mg-Al-Ox, while a mixture of highly dispersed (CuOx) and bulk copper oxide species (CuO and CuAl2O4) formed on Cu/Al2O3. The comparison of Cu-Mg-Al-Ox and Cu/Al2O3 in NH3-SCO provided good insight into the nature of the active species present in both copper-based catalysts.

With the same Pt loaded content (0.5\u00a0wt%), the Pt-loaded Mg4Ta2O9-x exhibits the excellent photocatalytic stability and higher hydrogen evolution activity (4.42\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00b7h\u2212\u00a01) than the Pt-loaded Mg4Ta2O9 (0.14\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00b7h\u2212\u00a01) under visible light irradiation.",

Tri-coordinated gold chloride with a vacant site shows high activity in adsorbing HCl and C2H2. Mechanisms in the first adsorption of HCl and C2H2 on gold were found to be the Eley-Rideal (ER) and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanisms, respectively. The transfer of Cl atom of AuCl3 to acetylene is the key step in the LH mechanism, which could form new vacant site to adsorb HCl effectively. Tri-coordinated gold was formed by removing Cl atom through addition reaction of acetylene in the induction period.",

     "abstract": "The shape and porous configuration of supports are key parameters to design outstanding catalysts. However, the selection of a proper mesoporous support, such as SBA-15, by itself does not guarantee accessibility to catalytic sites. The distribution of the active phase and its stability are strongly related to the procedure used to deposit it on the catalytic substrate. Herein, we have prepared rod-shaped SBA-15 silica supports functionalized with amine groups to facilitate the electrostatic attraction and a good distribution of the resulting Pt-based catalytic nanoparticles along the pore walls. Additionally, the use of tetrakis-(hydroxymethyl)-phosphonium chloride (THPC) as both reductant and stabilizer is presented as a novel alternative for Pt nanoparticle synthesis. The behaviour of this catalyst in the total oxidation of n-hexane demonstrates high activity and excellent stability after 70\u00a0h on reaction stream. STEM-HAADF and 3-D tomography were used to confirm the presence of the metallic nanoparticles within the mesochannels and to corroborate their reduced sintering after reaction.",

     "abstract": "Due to the excessive cost and scarcity of Pt metal, it is very vital to enhance the utilization efficiency and recovery yield of Pt-based catalysts. Herein, we employ a facile and simple approach to synthesize the hierarchical \u03b3-Fe2O3 microflowers supported Pt, which is assembled from \u03b3-Fe2O3 nanosheets as building blocks. Further analysis demonstrated that well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles with average size of 1.5\u00a0nm are uniformly supported on the \u03b3-Fe2O3 nanosheets and the hierarchical structure provides a large surface area and abundant macropores and mesopores. The resultant Pt/Fe2O3 microflowers show superior catalytic performance for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP), including high conversion and excellent recycling durability. Furthermore, the unique magnetically separable property of the Pt/Fe2O3 microflowers makes their recovery easy after reaction using an external magnet, which not only saves the cost and time but also tremendously increases the recovery yield of catalyst. Consequently, the magnetically recoverable Pt/Fe2O3 catalyst with the facile synthesized strategy, good catalytic performance and high utilization efficiency would be well expected as a potential candidate for practical utilization.",

The efficiency is attributed to the large surface area of the porous structure that greatly enhances the light absorption ability and the number of surface reaction sites. Furthermore, the separation of photo-generated charge carriers is efficiently facilitated by the large amount of CdS/C3N4 heterojunctions.",

In particular, CeO2/CuxO calcined at 300 and 350\u00a0\u00b0C consist of Cu+ and Cu2\u00a0+ and their catalytic activity is higher than that of CeO2/CuxO calcined at 400\u00a0\u00b0C for which copper is in the Cu2\u00a0+ state, as well as that of CeO2/CuxO calcined at 250\u00a0\u00b0C for which copper is in the Cu+ state.

However, homogeneous acid catalysts are still preferred in their industrial production, despite their associated energy cost and the environmental issues that they present. In this paper, we describe lignocellulose-derived amorphous carbons with a high loading level of SO3H and their application to the synthesis of polyolesters as a biobased heterogeneous acid catalyst. These sulfonated amorphous carbons could be readily prepared via (i) heat treatment at 400\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h and (ii) sulfonation with chlorosulfuric acid. XRD and BET analyses demonstrated that these carbonaceous materials were not crystalline but were amorphous structures with a low surface area. The attachment of SO3H groups was confirmed by FT-IR and XPS, and the loading level of SO3H was determined by CHNS elemental analysis. Chlorosulfuric acid gave a higher loading level of SO3H than other sulfating agents, such as conc. sulfuric acid and fuming sulfuric acid. The higher SO3H-loaded amorphous carbons exhibited a greater catalytic activity for esterification between trimethylolpropane and fatty acids under solventless conditions. Esterification of oleic acid derived from vegetable oil with trimethylolpropane using this catalyst afforded the desired biolubricant at over 93% yield in 3\u00a0h. The sulfonated amorphous carbons could be reused three times without any significant loss of catalytic activity.",

The latter is considered to be linked to the incorporation of rhodium, a component that promotes the NOx reduction selectivity towards N2. Also, lean/rich cycling experiments were carried out to simulate the cycling conditions that passive-SCR after treatment systems depend upon. High activity is again seen over the Pd/Ce/Al2O3 catalyst during short periodic switches. For the three-way catalyst, longer periodic switches are required for the onset of ammonia formation due to the high oxygen storage capacity of this sample as compared to the other two.

     "abstract": "Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is a promising technique to improve ozonation for degrading organic contaminants. Preparation of heterogeneous catalysts (e.g., substrate-supported metals and metal oxides) for ozonation typically involves multiple steps and reagents. Because iron (Fe) is an abundant and non-noble metal, Fe-based heterogeneous catalysts are attractive for ozonation. Therefore, it is critical to develop a readily-available, stable and non-toxic Fe-based heterogeneous catalyst. To this end, we propose ferrocene (Fc), consisting of two cyclopentadienyl rings bound on opposite sides of a central Fe2\u00a0+ atom, as a catalyst for ozonation. Degradation of the toxic dye amaranth was employed as a model test. The presence of Fc significantly improved amaranth degradation extent and kinetics, and Fc did not adsorb amaranth in water. Factors influencing amaranth degradation were investigated including Fc and ozone dosages, temperature, pH, and addition of NaCl and humic acid. Effects of radical inhibitors were also examined to provide insights into the occurrence of radical species during Fc-catalyzed ozonation. Degradation of amaranth was primarily attributed to derivative reactive oxygen species, as well as direct degradation by ozone to a lesser extent. A pathway of amaranth degradation is proposed based on degradation intermediates detected using LC/MS/MS. Fc was also re-used over multiple cycles for catalyzing ozonation to degrade amaranth without a loss of efficiency. These results indicate that Fc is a promising commercially available nanoscale heterogeneous catalyst for catalytic ozonation.",

Cu@Pt showed higher turnover frequencies of furfural hydrogenation compared to pure Pt and pure Cu. This improved reactivity is likely due to fewer Pt sites being blocked by strong hydrogen adsorption as a result of decreased H2 binding strength of Pt overlayer compared to pure Pt.",

Herein, these solvents were successfully used as the reaction media for enzyme-mediated transphosphatidylation of phosphatidylcholine with l-serine for the synthesis of phosphatidylserine for the first time. Enzymatic phosphatidylserine synthesis in various DESs was comprehensively investigated, employing phospholipase D. Our results indicated that >\u00a090% yield of phosphatidylserine could be achieved using choline chloride/ethylene glycol as DES. Furthermore, 81% original activity of the enzyme was maintained after being used for 10 batches. This study indicates that DESs act as potential candidates for the eco-friendly solvents in biocatalysis applications.",

BiOBr, using cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) as Br source and surface template, was prepared with water with the presence of three polyhydroxyl alcohols. Based on SEM, HR-TEM and XRD, mannitol results in different particle morphologies. Rather than smooth microspheres, projections form that double surface area. BiOBr prepared in mannitol displayed the highest photocatalytic activity and tripled the oxygen consumption rate compared to the other preparations. The Bi3\u00a0+\u2013mannitol complex competes with hydroxide for Bi3\u00a0+ in the CPB micelles and limits the availability of BiO+, altering the assembly process. A four-step mechanism for ligand-assisted assembly of BiOBr in mannitol is proposed.",

The intensity of the strongly perturbed band at 2205\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 correlates with the CO bond dissociation rate under conditions relevant to the Fischer\u2013Tropsch reaction. Due to the intermediate reactivity of Rh, step-edge sites are required to dissociate the strong CO bond. DFT calculations show that N2 prefers to adsorb on top of low-coordinated surface atoms such as steps, corners and edges. The occurrence of the intensity maximum at intermediate particle size is explained by the presence of surface overlayers on terraces that give rise to step-edges. These step-edge sites are important in the dissociation of di-atomic molecules such as CO, NO and N2.",

An oxygen-transformation and metal-dissociation mechanism for RWGS reaction was proposed. The dissociation of carbon dioxide over ceria by directly oxidized oxygen vacancy was considered as a main reaction pathway of RWGS. Meanwhile, dissociated adsorption of CO2 and hydrogen over nickel surface directly formed CO and supplied spillover hydrogen to nearby oxygen vacancies, respectively.

Specifically, Co3, with the most flexible cyclic framework exhibits the best catalytic performance among the three catalysts, due to the efficient cooperative interactions between two cobalt centers.",

     "abstract": "Simplifying the synthesis of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) photocathode has turned out to be critical for scalable application. Herein, we present a novel thermal conversion approach to synthesize a shell/core structured Cu2O/Cu photocathode. In this method a shell comprising a mixture of CuO and Cu2O is obtained by heating Cu mesh at 500\u00a0\u00b0C in air beforehand, and subsequent annealing in N2 atmosphere converts the unwanted CuO into Cu2O gradually, which results in the desired Cu2O/Cu structure. A slightly viscous starch sol coats the Cu2O shell as carbon source, after carbonizing under N2 atmosphere, the Cu2O/Cu is covered with compact carbon films, i.e. C/Cu2O/Cu. Photoelectrochemical experiments reveal that the introduction of carbon layers on Cu2O enhances the photocurrent density from \u2212\u00a01.5 to \u2212\u00a02.75\u00a0mA\u00b7cm\u2212\u00a02 at 0\u00a0V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

The resulting aqueous 1-cyanocycloalkaneacetic acid was then directly converted to 2-azaspiro [4.5] decan-3-one without further purification in subsequent hydrogenation by Raney-nickel, followed by simple chemical steps to afford gabapentin in high purity and 77.3% overall yield from 1-cyanocyclohexylacetonitrile.

     "abstract": "Sb-doped (BiO)2CO3 nanoplates have been successfully fabricated via a facile hydrothermal method. XRD patterns, XPS spectra, SEM and TEM images demonstrated that doping with antimony (Sb) has no effect on the crystal phase, morphology and structure of (BiO)2CO3 nanoplates. However, the red shift of diffraction peak in the 2\u03b8 range of 29\u201332\u00b0 was observed, which could be attributed to the substitution of larger radius of Bi atoms by lower radius of Sb atoms resulting in the decrease of lattice parameters. The photocatalytic performance of Sb-doped (BiO)2CO3 nanoplates was evaluated by the degradation of RhB upon visible light irradiation. It was found that the visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity of Sb-doped (BiO)2CO3 nanoplates was significantly improved, which was mainly attributed to its enhanced surface area and electron transfer rate. It was proposed that RhB photodegradation proceeded through a photosensitization pathway upon visible light irradiation.",

The coupled structure of Fe2WO6/TiO2 was then fabricated by covering the Fe2WO6 surface with polycrystalline TiO2 by sol\u2013gel process. Under visible-light irradiation, the Fe2WO6/TiO2 exhibits remarkable photocatalytic activity in decomposing gaseous 2-propanol and aqueous salicylic acid which is comparable to that of typical nitrogen-doped TiO2. It is deduced that its high catalytic activity originates from the hole-transfer from Fe2WO6 to TiO2.

The presence of hydrochloric acid during the complexing impregnation process resulted in a significant improvement of selectivity for p-xylene production by toluene methylation with dimethyl carbonate over MgO/MCM-22 catalysts. The dramatic performance was ascribed to the designated shifting of the complex equilibrium of malonic acid and Mg2\u00a0+, which may alter the coverage of acidic sites on the external surface of zeolite, adjust the pore size of zeolite, and therefore affect the shape-selective performances of the catalysts.",

Besides, the effect of the deposition dosage of Ag nanoparticles on the photocatalytic activity was also investigated. Under UV light irradiation, the Ag nanoparticles acted as electron traps, which enhanced electron\u2013hole separation efficiency of TiO2. Under visible light irradiation, the Ag nanoparticles showed surface plasmon resonance, which induced the visible light responsive photocatalytic activity for the obtained samples.",

In particular, we find that the thermodynamically stable surface termination in these Pt*/M alloys can be inverted from Pt-terminated in vacuum to M-terminated under exposure to oxygen (for an M that is more oxophilic than Pt). Interestingly, in many of these alloys, Pt is not driven into the bulk; rather it remains in the first subsurface layer where it enhances oxygen binding through a ligand interaction with the surface metal atoms. On the other hand, exposure to CO provides a much milder driving force for the surface composition inversion. To quantify segregation under catalytically relevant conditions, we constructed approximate phase diagrams for the PtRu system as a function of O2 and CO chemical potential (temperature, pressure).

The possibility of performing this step in the presence of CO2/O2, instead of air can remarkably mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and simultaneously produce a huge amount of CO for sequential uses. Herein, we report that alumina (usually present in 20\u201340\u00a0wt.% in the catalyst composition) modified by both potassium (5\u00a0wt.%) and vanadium (1\u00a0wt.%) was able to perform this goal under regular regeneration conditions, i.e. at 700\u00a0\u00b0C. The apparent activation energy values for CO2 and coke reaction on alumina, alumina with potassium and with both potassium and vanadium were 349, 249 and 192\u00a0kJ/mol respectively. In the presence of 13CO2 and O2 the primary observed product was 13CO, followed by 12CO and then by 12CO2.

Fe3\u00a0+ and Sn4\u00a0+ co-doped TiO2 with optimized phase composition were synthesized through a simple soft-chemical solution method. The visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of Fe3\u00a0+ and Sn4\u00a0+ co-doped TiO2 was 5 times of that of Evonik P25 TiO2 using degradation of methylene blue as model reaction. The synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, 119Sn M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. It is indicated that Sn4\u00a0+ doping can facilitate the phase transition from anatase to rutile. The different ratios of anatase and rutile can be achieved by tuning the amount of Sn4\u00a0+ doped into the lattice. Furthermore, the doping of Sn4\u00a0+ into TiO2 lattice can stabilize the phase composition when Fe3\u00a0+ is co-doped. In the Fe3\u00a0+ and Sn4\u00a0+ co-doped TiO2, Sn4\u00a0+ is mainly used to tune and stabilize the phase composition of TiO2 and Fe3\u00a0+ acts as a doping cation to narrow the band gap of TiO2. Both band gap and phase composition of TiO2 can be tuned effectively by the simultaneous introduction of Fe3\u00a0+ and Sn4\u00a0+. The synergic effect of optimized phase composition (anatase/rutile\u00a0=\u00a025/75) and narrowed band gap should be the two main reasons for the promoted photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under visible light.",

It is also found that the activity of catalysts is closely related to the synergy between the Cu and basic sites. The CH3OH yield for the fluorine-modified Cu/Zn/Al/Zr catalysts was higher than that for the fluorine-free catalysts; thus, the introduction of fluorine favored the methanol formation.",

The capillary condensation of H2O in the micropores of the catalyst inhibited SCR activity and the reaction of adsorbed NH3 and NO.",

Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of 1-butene is an alternative route to produce BD. In this study, a soft oxidant, CO2 was used instead of O2. Fe2O3 was selected from a preliminary screening using Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR). The catalytic performance was greatly improved by supporting Fe2O3 on Al2O3. This contribution clearly shows that both Fe2O3 and CO2 are involved in the reaction. The main byproducts, trans/cis-2-butenes, can also be converted to BD with similar BD yield. A preliminary reaction mechanism is proposed.",

     "abstract": "Nowadays, the syngas which is obtained from the reforming of coal, biomass or natural gas contain significantly amounts of CO2 that cannot be separated and consequently, it can take part into the Fischer\u2013Tropsch (FTS) catalytic activity. Therefore, the presence of CO2 in the syngas flow should be taken into account. In the present study, the FTS CO hydrogenation process was compared to that of CO2 on a carbon nanofibers supported Co catalyst. The influence of CO2 content in the feed stream (H2/CO/CO2 ratio) on the reaction performance in terms of conversion and selectivity to the different products was described. Both the support and the prepared catalyst were characterized by nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results showed that CO hydrogenation was controlled by a Fischer\u2013Tropsch regime, whereas CO2 hydrogenation was controlled by a methanation process. When feed was composed of CO and CO2 mixtures, the catalytic activity decreased with respect to that obtained with a CO2-free feed stream. Moreover, the presence of CO2 in feed stream favored the formation of lighter hydrocarbons and could block the production of further CO2 via Water-Gas-Shift (WGS) reaction.",

Synthesis time plays an important role in controlling the morphology, size and photocatalytic activity of both CuS and CuS/ZnS core/shell NCs which evolve from spherical shaped particles to form rods with increasing reaction time, and after 5\u00a0h resemble \u201cflower\u201d shaped morphologies in which each \u201cflower\u201d is composed of many NCs. Photocatalytic activity originates from photo-generated holes in the narrow bandgap CuS, with encapsulation by large bandgap ZnS layers used to form the core/shell structure that improves the resistance of CuS towards photocorrosion. Such CuS/ZnS core/shell structures exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity than CuS or ZnS NCs alone under visible light illumination, and is attributed to higher charge separation rates for the photo-generated carriers in the core/shell structure.",

The nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption analysis showed the mesopores over the catalyst surface with narrow pore size of 4.5\u00a0nm. About 0.125\u00a0g/L of dosage was found to be optimum for efficient removal of 2-EEA.

The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra indicated that metallic palladium is observed in the whole temperature range investigated (up to 900\u00a0\u00b0C) and irrespective of the air/fuel ratio. In both natural gas and gasoline cycles, the XANES data show that the PdO reduced in the rich periods cannot be restored in the lean periods. With this background, activity for methane abatement in the high temperature regime is greatly affected by the oxidation state of palladium rather than by the change of air/fuel ratio. In the case of propene oxidation, while Pd also remains predominantly in the reduced state, activity is dictated by the oxygen concentration in the feedstock. Comparison between the two hydrocarbons demonstrates that the oxidation state of Pd may be responsible for observed methane emissions under realistic operating circumstances. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that reduced Pd may be continuously present during operation in agreement with observations on real catalytic converters. Although this may be the average oxidation state of Pd, more advanced probes are certainly necessary to capture variations of oxidation state under the fast oscillatory conditions needed to imitate real operation.",

The temperature at 50% soot conversion over RuOx/SiO2 in the presence of NO and O2 is about 120\u00a0K lower than that only in the presence of O2. It has been identified that NO was adsorbed on the surface of RuOx in the presence of O2. The adsorbed NO was highly active for oxidizing soot, which can be attributed to the high mass transferring of the active species in the reaction systems. The mechanism of NO dissociation is also discussed in soot oxidation.",

Although the one- and two-electron reductions have similar potentials (\u2212\u00a01.03 and \u2212\u00a01.04\u00a0V, respectively), gold nanocatalysts change the traditional reduction reaction pathway of EY dye with BH to a selective one-electron reduction instead of two. The resultant one-electron reduction product is a slightly persistent semiquinone intermediate: the same as is produced with the electrochemical one-electron reduction. This is the first example of nanocatalysts guiding a reaction to the same products as the electrochemical pathway. The semiquinone intermediate was found to be photochemically active and decomposed by light into a novel green EY dye after losing two bromine atoms. Whereas in the dark, the semiquinone intermediate radical was found to be reduced by accepting another electron forming a colorless reduced form of EY. It was found that hollow gold nanoparticles were superior catalysts for this reaction than solid gold nanoparticles; this was attributed to the cage effect of hollow nanoparticles.

The sulphidation of the catalyst by THT has been studied by IR spectroscopy. Infrared spectra of CO adsorbed at low temperature over the oxidized, the reduced and the sulphurized catalyst have also been recorded. The catalyst acts as a bifunctional one, with the behaviour attributed to the uncovered support (alumina modified by nickel ions) at 773\u00a0K (dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and alkylation of phenol with ethanol) that fully disappears at 973\u00a0K when steam reforming occurs very selectively. By lowering back the reaction temperature, the support behaviour reappears. THT poisons selectively the Ni component, thus causing the appearance of the support behaviour also at 973\u00a0K. IR experiments show that THT deposes sulphur at the catalyst surface with the production of gas-phase 1,3-butadiene, thus converting the catalyst into a \u201csulphided\u201d SR-inactive state. The steam reforming activity of the poisoned catalyst progressively reappears upon feeding back S-free feed at 973\u00a0K.

The driving force for the nanoparticles synthesis was obtained by using concentrated solar energy as a dual energy source in the form of radiational and thermal effect. The resulting magnesium oxide nanoparticles are found to be excellent and reusable catalyst for the Claisen\u2013Schmidt condensation under solvent free condition.",

Thus, palladium-promoted nickel catalysts supported on MCF were prepared, and their activities were tested in cellulose pyrolysis (RT\u00a0\u2192\u00a0800\u00a0\u00b0C, 40\u00a0\u00b0C/min) under dry argon.

Although the Pd promoters had little impact on the fraction of H2 in the product gas, adding \u2265\u00a00.4\u00a0wt.% Pd enhanced the H2 yield from cellulose pyrolysis by increasing the total gas yield from the reaction. Thus the promoter improved H2 yield by enhancing the tar-cracking activity of the catalyst.

Electrochemical measurement revealed that Pt/IrO2/CNT exhibits much higher activity for methanol oxidation and better CO tolerance than Pt/CNT. The anodic peak current of methanol oxidation on Pt/IrO2/CNT (873.1A gPt\u2212\u00a01) is 2.6 times that of Pt/CNT catalyst (335.7A gPt\u2212\u00a01). The enhanced performance of Pt/IrO2/CNT is attributed to the fact that IrO2 improves the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles, and lowers the charge transfer resistance in methanol electrooxidation.",

     "abstract": "Despite the considerable progress in the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of the oscillatory electro-oxidation of C1 molecules, there are apparently no systematic studies concerning the impact of surface modifiers on the oscillation dynamics. Herein we communicate on the oscillatory electro-oxidation of formic acid on ordered Pt3Sn intermetallic phase, and compare the results with those obtained on a polycrystalline platinum electrode. Overall, the obtained results were very reproducible, robust and allowed a detailed analysis on the correlation between the catalytic activity and the oscillation dynamics. The presence of Sn in the intermetallic electrode promotes drastic effects on the oscillatory dynamics. The decrease in the mean electrode potential and in the oscillation frequency, as well as the pronounced increase in the number oscillations (and also in the oscillation time), was discussed in connection with the substantial catalytic enhancement of the Pt3Sn towards the electro-oxidation of formic acid. The self-organized potential oscillations were used to probe the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt3Sn electrode and compare it with that for polycrystalline Pt. The presence of Sn resulted in a significant decrease (2\u201311 times, depending on the applied current) of the rate of surface poisoning.",

These and similar materials may have many applications including photocatalysis because of the ability to tune the plasmonic and catalytic properties. After immobilization onto silica, the particles were tested for methanol decomposition and partial methanol oxidation. For methanol decomposition, Ag/silica was the more active than Pt/silica. This result was in agreement with product poisoning (CO) limiting turnover and CO generally binding more weakly to Ag than Pt surfaces. The properties of the bimetallic Pt\u2013Ag were between the parent catalysts, but different than their physical mixture, which indicated Pt\u2013Ag bimetallic formation. The catalytic activity for partial methanol oxidation was greater than methanol decomposition for all catalysts. The Pt/silica catalyst demonstrated the best hydrogen and carbon dioxide yields when oxygen was added. The results are discussed in the discussion of a two-step process in which methanol is decomposed to carbon monoxide and hydrogen and then these species are oxidized to water and carbon dioxide. Further work is needed to refine the process and the catalyst to achieve CO-free hydrogen from methanol and oxygen.",

The reaction was studied in a batch reactor at 300\u00a0\u00b0C and 5\u00a0MPa. Activity differences on the carbon supports are correlated with the dispersion of MoS2. Greater abundance of surface oxygen (mainly carboxylic, quinonic and lactonic groups) on the support resulted in lower catalyst dispersion and lower HDO activity. The dispersion, textural properties and surface chemistry did not affect the nature of the MoS2 active sites.",

In the presence of aniline, nitrobenzene adsorbs on other sites on titania, as it is not able to displace aniline from hydroxyl sites. On alumina, nitrobenzene displaces some aniline from the surface hydroxyl groups. Nitrobenzene and aniline thus compete, at least in part, for the same sites on alumina, but not on titania.",

AA hydroconversion activity of the parent alumina supported Ni catalyst and the yield of selectively produced alcohol can be increased drastically by In2O3 addition. Efficient catalysts, containing finely dispersed metal particles were obtained by reduction with H2 at 450\u00a0\u00b0C. In the catalysts modified with In2O3 additive formation of indium metal and/or an intermetallic compound (InNi2) was observed resulting in a different catalytic behavior as for pure nickel particles supported on alumina. Appearance of metallic indium can direct the step by step catalytic reduction to ethanol formation inhibiting decarbonylation, decarboxylation, and additional dehydration. On comparing the commercial, conventionally used catalysts with the bimetallic alumina supported composite (InNi/Al2O3) the novel catalyst proved to be much more active and selective for producing ethanol.",

The experimental set-up was extraordinary simple. An open-to-the-atmosphere glass beaker was used as reactor. Just enough octadecanol was placed on the silicon-supported catalytic surface to cover it with a thin film when melted.

The comparative kinetic investigation reveals that the dichlorocyclopropanation of 1-methyl-4-vinyl benzene is faster than styrene in the presence of the new catalyst. This catalyst can be used several times with consistent catalytic activity. Experimental observations support an interfacial-type mechanism.

Under the same conditions, Pd/Mo2N was non-selective, generating nitrobenzene and aniline via combined hydrodechlorination and hydrogenation. These results demonstrate the viability of Au/Mo2N as a new catalyst formulation in selective substituted nitroarene hydrogenation.",

Their catalytic performances for the ethanol conversion to propylene were investigated in a continuous flow fixed-bed micro-reactor.

While dimethyl ether does not participate in the process, the addition of methyl formate remarkably increases the MeOH production by its oxygen-assisted split into active intermediate species (CH3O\u204e and HCOO\u204e). Specifically, a breakthrough role was assigned to ZnO as catalytic partner for methyl formate conversion to methanol, since even the Cu-free ZnO/Al2O3 sample shows a considerable MeOH yield on MeF co-feeding. Alternatively, in the Zn-free Cu/Al2O3 sample, the presence of carbon dioxide in the inlet mixture was crucial to activate the methyl formate conversion path, likely because CO2 provides readily available oxygen to the Cu surface.",

TPR studies of used catalysts confirm coking of the catalysts. The superior catalytic activity in terms of conversion and selectivity during time on stream operation exhibited by Ni/SBA-15 catalyst is due to the hydrophobic nature of this catalyst (resistant to water generated during the reaction) and the effect of coking is not significant.",

In the presence of pure zirconia catalysts, it was found that ZrO2 interacts with CB and can be reduced into Zr3+ formed in tetragonal phase of this oxide support.

The carbonaceous signals disappeared completely after CB oxidation in agreement with a regeneration of the catalyst treated under air.For copper supported on zirconia catalysts, oxygen surrounding isolated Cu(II) species and oxygen from tetragonal ZrO2 lattice are involved in carbon black oxidation.

Clopyralid (3,6-dichloropyridine-2-carboxylic acid) is a systemic herbicide from the chemical class of pyridine compounds, which has a high potential to contaminate water sources. The hydrodechlorination of clopyralid (C6H3NO2Cl2) proceeds step-wise to the monochlorinated intermediates 3-chloropyridine-2-carboxylic acid and 6-chloropyridine-2-carboxylic acid (C6H4NO2Cl) and to the dechlorinated intermediate picolinic acid (C6H5NO2). The dechlorination is followed by hydrogenation with formation of the harmless end product pipecolinic acid (C6H10NO2). With different alumina supported mono- and bimetallic catalysts a complete dechlorination and hydrogenation of clopyralid could be achieved. Pd and PdAu catalysts showed the highest activity for the dechlorination steps whereas the Pt and PtAu catalysts are most active in the complete conversion of clopyralid, i.e. combined dechlorination and hydrogenation.

The mixed solution of iron nitrate with ethylene glycol (EG) and methanol was infiltrated into the void of the colloidal crystal of a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sphere with size in several microns. Heating initiated nitrate oxidation of the EG to produce metal glyoxylate salt. Further heating converted the glyoxylate salt to metal oxide and the skeleton of PMMA was reserved, which produced the hierarchically mesoporous and macroporous hematite Fe2O3. The fabricated iron oxide was applied to catalyze the FTS, showing high reaction activity and stability in comparison with the conventional Fe FTS catalyst.",

In comparison with the commercial TiO2 powder (P25) supported 1\u00a0wt.% Ru catalyst, Ru/TiNTA shows higher activity and much better stability.

A systematic increase of the CO2 mole fraction of carbon in the feed gas mixture alters the product distribution dramatically for cobalt FT synthesis with CO2 behaving like an inert gas at higher partial pressure of CO. With cobalt, CO appears to compete with CO2 for adsorption. Using an iron FT catalyst, hydrogenation of CO2 was effected due to the presence of the reverse water\u2013gas shift activity of the catalyst which converts CO2 to hydrocarbons through the formation of CO. Unlike the cobalt catalyst, the product distribution was only slightly altered with increasing CO2 content in the feed gas mixture to the iron catalyst.

The results showed that different reactive ruthenium oxide species are formed following calcination at 600\u00a0\u00b0C. The reactivity increases with the cerium content in the support, Ru/CeO2 being the most reactive catalyst. However, the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 support and corresponding catalyst, Ru/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, exhibited decreased reactivities comparing to solids with lower cerium content. This was ascribed to the formation of a solid structure that inhibits the interaction between cerium and ruthenium oxide species following impregnation.",

An optimal size for the highest photocatalytic activity was determined for Pt-WO3 nanoparticles (18\u201326.4\u00a0nm). Based on the initial rate of photodegradation analysis, the optimal size of Pt-WO3 exhibited an approximately 3.5-fold higher rate compared with other sizes. The dynamics of the electron/hole recombination process at different sizes indicates that photodegradation activity is dependent on particle size.",

The study was made before and after use of these catalysts in the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene. The microstructure of carbon-stabilized MoS2 is characterized by nanoslabs of \u2248\u00a02\u00a0nm average stacking height embedded in an amorphous matrix with a very broad pore-size distribution. Thermal stress induced a collapse of the microporous structure leading to the formation of mainly mesopores. The carbon is well-distributed over the bulk, without any signature of carbide species detected neither in XPS nor in EXAFS measurements. The activity patterns of both materials (related to the OCS capacity) were similar despite the differing sulfur content, with the carbon-stabilized MoS2 being more sulfur deficient. This suggests that the catalytic properties of the latter material were caused by near-stoichiometric MoS2 apparently present in the nanoslabs, whereas the sulfur vacancies in the sulfur-deficient amorphous phase were blocked by strongly adsorbed carbon residues. Interestingly, the HDS reaction did not cause significant changes of the properties of the carbon-stabilized MoS2. Conversely, the reference MoS2 was strongly activated, in particular with respect to ethene hydrogenation, which can be explained by a pronounced sulfur loss during the HDS reaction, without significant site blockage by the coke deposited.",

This sequential stage reaction process provides lower glycerol conversion but increases the selectivity ratio between 1,2 propanediol and the main liquid by-product, ethylenglycol.The influence of two relevant variables in this process, H2/glycerol ratio and initial glycerol concentration, is analysed. Increasing the H2/glycerol ratio increases glycerol conversion, although it also causes higher production of unfavourable ethylenglycol.

     "abstract": "The Pt\u2013ceria synergy may be described as the dehydrogenation of formate formed on the surface of the partially reducible oxide (PRO), ceria, by Pt across the interface, with H2O participating in the transition state. However, due to the rising costs of rare earth oxides like ceria, replacement by a less expensive partially reducible oxide, like manganese oxide, is desirable. In this contribution, a comparison between Pt/ceria and Pt/manganese oxide catalysts possessing comparable Pt dispersions reveals that there are significant differences and certain similarities in the nature of the two Pt/PRO catalysts. With ceria, partial reduction involves reduction of the oxide surface shell, with Ce3+ at the surface and Ce4+ in the bulk. In the case of manganese oxide, partial reduction results in a mixture of Mn3+ and Mn2+, with Mn2+ located at the surface. With Pt/CeOX, a high density of defect-associated bridging OH groups react with CO to yield a high density of the formate intermediate. With Pt/MnOX, the fraction of reactive OH groups is low and much lower formate band intensities result upon CO adsorption; moreover, there is a greater fraction of OH groups that are essentially unreactive. Thus, much lower CO conversion rates are observed with Pt/MnOX during low temperature water\u2013gas shift. As with ceria, increasing the Pt loading facilitates partial reduction of MnOX to lower temperature, indicating metal\u2013oxide interactions should be taken into account.",

A catalyst composed of 60\u00a0wt.% Fe2O3 and 40\u00a0wt.% CeO2 gave optimal catalytic activity, and the highest iron metal surface area. The well-dispersed Fe state helped to maintain the active surface area for the reaction. Methane conversion increased when the reaction temperature was increased from 600 to 650\u00a0\u00b0C. Continuous formation of trace amounts of carbon monoxide was observed during the reaction due to the oxidation of carbonaceous species by high mobility lattice oxygen in the solid solution formed within the catalyst.

     "abstract": "SO2 has been recognized as an effective reducing agent for N2O over iron-containing zeolite catalysts, lowering the operation temperature up to 100\u00a0K with respect to the direct N2O decomposition. This unique behavior contrasts with the common poisoning effect of SO2 over other active de-N2O metals (e.g. Co, Cu, Rh, and Ru). The formation of surface sulfates has been generally posed as the main cause for catalyst deactivation by SO2. Through the use of in situ infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), we show that steam-activated FeZSM-5 indeed builds up stable sulfate species during the N2O\u00a0+\u00a0SO2 reaction. Significant amounts of sulfur were detected in the used catalyst by elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. However, the enhanced N2O conversion is remarkably stable, indicating that the reducing action by SO2 and the sulfation of the surface are decoupled. The resulting sulfate species are thus spectators in the catalytic process and do not block or alter the structure of the active sites for N2O reduction and decomposition.",

Computed electronic properties, charge transfers and frequency analysis of \u03b1-oxygen and iron in [O\u2013Fe\u2013O]+ and [OFe\u2013(\u03bcO)\u2013(\u03bcOH)\u2013FeO]+ suggest a FeII character for the isolated and FeIV for the binuclear Fe\u2013ZSM-5 sites. Addition of CO on oxygen atoms reveals that along the oxidation reaction the valence state for the isolated iron is II and remains relatively constant while a clear change from IV to II is calculated for the binuclear iron. According to DFT calculations CO addition on the \u03b1-oxygen from the iron active sites induces a significant length increase of the Fe\u2013\u03b1-oxygen bond. Whatever the \u03b1-sites, the addition of CO is strongly exothermic and leads to stable minima resembling an adsorbed CO2 on iron active site. This reactivity is in line with the well known high reactivity of \u03b1-oxygen and the rapid CO2 formation at low temperatures. Based on the calculated enthalpy values, the adsorption of CO is slightly more favourable on binuclear [OFe\u2013(\u03bcO)\u2013(\u03bcOH)\u2013FeO]+ than over isolated [O\u2013Fe\u2013O]+ iron site.

Improved catalyst stability was observed on small crystallites due to faster removal of products with the shorter diffusion path length, reducing the formation of coke precursors. As previously shown, C9 aromatics are the initial aromatics produced from propanal via aldol condensation followed by cyclization and these have less opportunity to crack to lighter aromatics on the small crystallites. Thus, a higher ratio of C9/(C8+\u00a0C7) aromatics was observed on the small crystallites. The main isomer of the C8 aromatic products observed on small crystallites was the initial cracking product of the C9 aromatics, and thermodynamically preferred, meta-xylene, while the shape-selective preferred para-xylene was the predominant product on large crystallites. The higher internal diffusion rate of the para isomer results in greater shape selectivity with the longer path of the large crystallite zeolite. It is concluded that the use of smaller crystallite HZSM-5 improves results for production of alkyl aromatics from light oxygenates at mild conditions that may prove useful for bio-oil upgrading.",

It was found that the addition of Ce leads to ceria particles being formed upon iron and thus most likely leading to a reduction in available chain-growth active sites on the iron.",

Investigation also shows that the onset reaction temperature of the glycolysis process catalyzed by [bmim]FeCl4 is much lower, being 140\u00a0\u00b0C. The proposed mechanism indicates that the high catalytic activity of [bmim]FeCl4 is attributed to the synergic effect of its cation and anion.",

The activity of the as-prepared catalyst was remarkably enhanced compared with KBH4, H2 or carbothermal reduced Ni/AC catalyst. The Ni particles and the variation of oxygen-containing surface groups (OSGs) were studied by XRD, TEM, FT\u2013IR, He-TPD and NH3-TPD techniques. The high dispersed Ni and the acidity generated by the OSGs have the synergy effect on the activity of glycerol hydrogenolysis.",
