     "abstract": "An isolated CH bond in a molecule has a very low reactivity owing to the large kinetic barrier associated to the CH bond cleavage and the apolar nature of this bond. For this reason, the selective reactivity of such a non-functional group is under active study since several decades and is still regarded as the Holy Grail in chemistry. Metal-catalyzed CH activation/functionalization chemistry allows the step-economical and original construction of CC as well as CO and CN bonds starting from hydrocarbons (or hydrocarbon fragments) without the need of prior non catalytic oxidation steps. Furthermore, it can be of utmost importance in the domain of multistep syntheses, and also in transformations of societal significance such as the conversion of methane into methanol. This tutorial review addresses to students and researchers who would like to become acquainted with this fascinating topic. After a brief historical introduction, the main mechanistic fundaments of metal-catalyzed CH activation are exposed. Then, a selection of seminal advances and conceptual breakthroughs are presented.",

     "abstract": "The quest of selective catalytic reactions for direct conversion of alkanes into valued products remains to be the most important task objective of modern chemistry and metal complex catalysis. Nowadays it is adopted that the formation of metal\u2013alkyl intermediates (MR) is a necessary condition for activation and functionalization of alkanes on metal complexes but the mechanism of subsequent reactions of metal alkyls remain obscure, so that effective catalytic systems of this kind are still rare and uncommon. Although it is widely adopted that alkane \u03c3-complexes (M\u00b7RH) most frequently are primary hydrocarbon intermediates in these processes, low profile in the literature is given to their reactivity and these are often considered simply just as some \u2018collision complexes\u2019. Nevertheless, theoretical and experimental studies provide more and more evidence that the \u0421\u041d bonds in such complexes may be markedly weakened and/or polarized, thus opening wide horizons for occurrence of subsequent direct homolytic or heterolytic reactions of alkanes. This review addresses the discussion of new routes for activation and oxygenation of saturated hydrocarbons, including those via alkane \u03c3-complexes, without formation of metal\u2013alkyl intermediates.",

     "abstract": "CH bond catalytic activation/functionalization has been matter of great interest, since these transformations could establish new grounds from the synthetic perspective, and could serve to propose alternative and greener methods for the production of organic molecules. In this sense, the development of efficient catalytic systems for CH bond activation becomes of great importance, and understanding the principles that govern such transformations, either stoichiometric or catalytic, is essential. To study such processes from the mechanistic or catalytic point of view requires of the design of ligands and catalysts able of performing CH bond activation. (P,N)-chelates have arisen as alternative ligands to develop new catalytic systems, due to their combination of different donor atoms, and the ability to tune their steric and electronic characteristics and to create potential vacant sites at the metal center due to hemilability.This mini review summarizes the advances from 2005 to 2015 in the field of CH bond activation at transition metal centers from groups 8\u201310 bearing (P,N)-chelating ligands. Even when the examples of inter- or intramolecular CH bond activation using transition metal complexes with the (P,N) ligands described herein do not engage yet in catalytic applications, their understanding becomes of great importance and sets the basis for future developments in this field.",

     "abstract": "The effective functionalization of CH bond in methane, the main hydrocarbon component in Earth's crust and the most real source of energy for mankind in the nearest observable future, is undoubtedly can be regarded nowadays as one of the most important scientific and technological tasks. However, the usual practice of considering catalytic and gas-phase processes as independent technological branches seriously restricts the possibilities for a deeper understanding and technological optimization of real processes. The development of more effective technologies to convert methane and other gas-phase hydrocarbons into more valuable and demanded chemicals needs a complex approach based on the combined heterogeneous\u2013homogeneous chemistry of these processes. A number of examples are used to illustrate the interconnection between heterogeneous catalytic and gas-phase processes in oxidative functionalization of methane. A number of potential possibilities for the optimization of the real heterogeneous\u2013homogeneous chemistry of these processes are discussed.",

     "abstract": "A new hybrid Fe3O4@mSiO2@Cu4 material was constructed by loading a bio-inspired tetracopper(II) coordination compound [Cu4(\u03bc4-O){N(CH2CH2O)3}4(BOH)4][BF4]2 (Cu4) onto the Fe3O4@mSiO2 core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) composed of a magnetite (Fe3O4) core and mesoporous silica (mSiO2) shell with perpendicularly aligned channels. The obtained Fe3O4@mSiO2@Cu4 magnetic nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), FT-IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and field-dependent magnetization. This hybrid material acts as a magnetically recoverable C\u2212H functionalization nanocatalyst, namely for the mild oxidation, by t-butyl hydroperoxide at 50\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C in acetonitrile medium, of cycloalkanes (cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, and cyclooctane) to the corresponding alcohols and ketones (with up to \u223c15% yields based on cycloalkane; TON 335). A related oxidation process using cyclohexanol as a more reactive substrate leads to the formation of cyclohexanone in up to \u223c25% yield (TON 570). The Fe3O4@mSiO2@Cu4 nanocatalyst can be recycled five times without an appreciable loss of activity. The bond-, regio-, and stereoselectivity parameters were investigated in the oxidation of different alkane substrates (n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, methylcyclohexane, adamantane, cis- and trans-1,2-demethylcyclohexane), and the obtained results were compared with the homogeneous systems based on the Cu4 catalyst. In particular, the high bond selectivity parameters detected in the oxidation of methylcyclohexane (1\u00b0:2\u00b0:3\u00b0 of 1:8:142) and adamantane (2\u00b0:3\u00b0 of 1:21) catalyzed by Fe3O4@mSiO2@Cu4 suggest that the reactions possibly occur in hydrophobic pockets of the nanocatalyst.",

     "abstract": "The oxidation reactions of alkanes with hydrogen peroxide and peracids (peracetic acid (PAA) and m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA)) catalysed by two Fe(II) complexes of pentadentate {N5}-donor ligands have been investigated. Kinetic isotope effect experiments and the use of other mechanistic probes have also been performed. While the total yields of oxidized products are similar regardless of oxidant (e.g. 30\u201339% for oxidation of cyclohexane), the observed alcohol/ketone ratios and kinetic isotope effects differ significantly with different oxidants. Catalytic reactions in H2O2 medium are consistent with the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in the CH bond cleavage step, and resultant low kinetic isotope effect values. On the other hand, catalytic reactions performed using peracid media indicate the involvement of an oxidant different from the hydroxyl radical. For these reactions, the kinetic isotope effect values are relatively high (within a range of 4.2\u20135.1) and the C3/C2 selectivity parameters in adamantane oxidation are greater than 11, thereby excluding the presence of hydroxyl radicals in the CH bond cleavage step. A low spin Fe(III)-OOH species has been detected in the H2O2-based catalytic system by UV/Vis, mass spectrometry and EPR spectroscopy, while an Fe(IV)-oxo species is postulated to be the active oxidant in the peracid-based catalytic systems. Computational studies on the CH oxidation mechanism reveal that while the hydroxyl radical is mainly responsible for the H-atom abstraction in the H2O2-based catalytic system, it is the Fe(IV)-oxo species that abstracts the H-atom from the substrate in the peracid-based catalytic systems, in agreement with the experimental observations.",

These were isolated as stable and aqua-soluble microcrystalline products and were fully characterized by IR spectroscopy, ESI\u2013MS(\u00b1), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, the latter revealing distinct Cu2 cores containing the five-coordinate copper(II) centers with the {CuN2O3} or {CuNO4} environments. Compounds 1 and 2 were used as homogeneous catalysts for the mild oxidation of C5\u2013C8 cycloalkanes to give the corresponding cyclic alcohols and ketones in up to 23% overall yields based on cycloalkane. The reactions proceed in aqueous acetonitrile medium at 50\u00a0\u00b0C using H2O2 as an oxidant. The effects of different reaction conditions were studied, including the type and loading of catalyst, amount and kind of acid promoter, and water concentration. Despite the fact that different acids (HNO3, H2SO4, HCl, or CF3COOH) promote the oxidation of alkanes, the reaction is exceptionally fast in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, resulting in the TOF values of up to 430\u00a0h\u22121. Although water typically strongly inhibits alkane oxidations due to the reduction of H2O2 concentration and lowering of the alkane solubility, in the systems comprising 1 and 2 we observed a significant growth (up to 5-fold) of an initial reaction rate in the cyclohexane oxidation on increasing the amount of H2O in the reaction mixture. The bond-, regio- and stereo-selectivity parameters were investigated in oxidation of different linear, branched, and cyclic alkane substrates. Both compounds 1 and 2 also catalyze the hydrocarboxylation of C5\u2013C8 cycloalkanes, by CO, K2S2O8, and H2O in a water/acetonitrile medium at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, to give the corresponding cycloalkanecarboxylic acids in up to 38% yields based on cycloalkanes.",

In optimization studies using 1-phenyl-2-propen-1-ol (7a) in THF and in iPrOH/MeONa, the only observed product was the saturated alcohol 1-phenyl-1-propanol (9a) when working under a 30\u00a0bar H2 pressure, but activation for only 1\u00a0min under H2 pressure and then continuation under 1\u00a0bar of H2 or Ar led to increasing amounts of the allylic isomerization product propiophenone (8a). Continued reaction under H2 converted (8a) into (9a). The Rh precatalysts were more active than the Ir analogues. For the rhodium precatalysts (3) and (4), the redox isomerization reaction could be carried out after precatalyst activation in iPrOH/MeONa under Ar at 82\u00a0\u00b0C (without H2) with complete conversion in 1\u00a0h (1% catalyst loading).

The new concepts are introduced: a \u201cdirect kinetic study of CH activation\u201d, \u201cvisible and hidden reagent preactivation\u201d, the \u201cstrongest reactant and earliest transition state\u201d (ETS), the \u201c5/6 effect\u201d (the ratio of CH bonds splitting constant rates in the \u0441-C5H10/\u0441-C6H12 couple), \u201csingle-factor compensation effect\u201d (SCE), and a \u201crefined compensation temperature\u201d. The compensation effect (CE) exists in reality, but it is necessary to exclude the influence side factors, for example, to go from rate constants to the 5/6 effect to observe its purest form. The 5/6-CE combination as an example SCE is a new instrument for studying CH-activation mechanisms. Temperature dependences of (5/6) values for the reagents in aqueous solution (PtII, MnO4\u2212, HMnO4, HOCl, HOONO, HVO2 \u2013 RuIV, OH, SO4\u2212) and sulfuric acid (PdII, HgII, CrO3, MnIII, CoIII, NO2+, OH+, 1-adamantyl cation, C14H11+, \u0421\u041d2OH+, SO3H+) are found. The only influencing factor on the (5/6) value is conformational strain difference in the C5 and C6 rings, which in a series of one-type reactions decreases with increasing the reagent activity. Four mechanisms are revealed: H-atom abstraction by anionic (I\u2212), uncharged (I0) and cationic (I+) oxygen-centered \u201cO-reactants\u201d, and a bifunctional incorporation into CH bond of electrophilic cation \u2013 base adduct (II+). Various SCE lines (the entropy change versus enthalpy changing) for these groups are found. They converge in a \u201cSCE pole\u201d (the first example of ETS). Features of these mechanisms, differences of PtII, PdII, HgII acidocomplexes as the reagents and a surprising similarity between the Shilov reactant PtIICl3(H2O) and OH radicals in the water are discussed. The probable general cause of CEs in various processes is compensation effects in thermodynamics of interparticle interactions.",

Previous investigations into Tp\u2032PtLnXm complexes [Tp\u2032\u00a0=\u00a0hydridotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate] revealed the importance of hemilability as the Tp\u2032 ligand facilitates Pt(II/IV) interconversions.

Oxidation from Pt(II) to Pt(IV) with electrophilic reagents, simple acids and acid chlorides, leads to isomers in some cases, and the binding properties of the various donor arms dictate the stereochemistry of the products. Investigations into the reactivity of heteroscorpionate tridentate ligands bound to platinum(II) led to CCl activation reactions with methylene chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane.

     "abstract": "A novel catalytic reaction of alcohol etherification in the system ROH \u2212 PtCl42\u2212 \u2010 PtCl62\u2212 was found. Methanol easily transforms into dimethyl ether in the presence of catalytic amounts of PtII chloro complexes at 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Under the same conditions reaction of ethanol affords diethyl ether (catalytic) and \u03c0-ethylene PtII complex (stoichiometric). The reactions are accompanied by multiple H/D exchange, which is indicative of intermediacy of corresponding alkyl platinum derivatives. The plausible reaction mechanism involves oxidative addition of alcohol forming intermediate alkyl platinum(IV) derivative followed by decomposition of it via reductive elimination step under the action of alcohol giving the ether and regenerating catalyst. In the case of ethyl alcohol reaction, \u03b2-hydrogen abstraction from the intermediate Pt-ethyl species yields \u03c0-ethylene platinum(II) complex. Although it seems that the reaction does not involve the initial breaking of CH bonds of an alcohol, this system can be regarded as a model for studying of some peculiarities of Shilov chemistry, in particular, of isotope scrambling mechanisms in Shilov alkane activation.In contrast to reactions of dimethyl and diethyl ethers formation, tert-butyl ethers formation in CD3OH/t-BuOH medium is catalyzed by PtIV chloro complexes also and is not accompanied by isotope scrambling. These observations argue against intermediacy of alkyl platinum derivatives suggesting that acid-catalyzed mechanism operates in tert-butyl alcohol etherification.",

This very strong two-electron oxidizing species is generated from peroxo complex PcFe(IV)\u03bcNFe(III)OOR(Pc) (RH in the case of H2O2) via heterolytic OO bond cleavage.

Both hybrids are non-porous bearing graphitic layers intermixed with disordered sp2/sp3 carbon units.

Both showed high selectivity towards epoxides and comparing the achieved yields and TONs, they appear equivalent. However, MnII-L3imid@PCox catalyst is kinetically faster than the MnII-L3imid@Cox (accomplishing the catalytic runs in 1.5\u00a0h vs. 5\u00a0h). Thus, despite the similarity in TONs MnII-L3imid@PCox achieved extremely higher TOFs vs. MnII-L3imid@Cox.

The free energy changes at the stages of the addition and isomerization are negative; the maximal energy barrier on the reaction pathway is small. In the Mg-free system LTiCl2-AlR3, the isomerization proceeds through the single energy barrier with a significantly higher amplitude.

In contrast to single crystal studies, the assignment of CO adsorption to the nanoparticle structure is still controversial. Here we present a case study where we assign CO adsorption bands to the structure of Platinum nanoparticles with a given size distribution. Using a special diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) cell allows to achieve high quality data under in-situ conditions. Temperature dependent CO adsorption spectra are resolved into three bands which depend on the applied flow and pretreatment conditions. Our calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) can mimic the experimental findings and link these bands to the particle structure. By explicitly calculating the IR spectra of CO/Pt nanoparticles of different sizes we show that the IR bands are due to a combined size and site effect. For fully covered small nanoparticles the IR bands are attributed to all binding sites. For larger nanoparticles the dominant contribution is related to {111} facets but the other bands are still site independent. Here we provide a tool to assign CO adsorption bands on Platinum nanoparticles with a given size distribution. This can be related to the structure\u2013acitvity relationship which is required for a tailored catalyst design.",

Theoretical and experimental investigation showed that the matched electronic structure between AgTaO3 and AgBr induced an efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from AgBr to AgTaO3, leading to efficient charge separation and the subsequent improved photocatalytic activity. Partial AgBr converted to AgBr/Ag during the photocatalytic process, leading to the construction of ternary AgTaO3/AgBr/Ag photocatalyst.

     "abstract": "Protonation of copper-triazolide is a distinctive and final part in CuAAC reaction which has kinetic importance such that it can even affect the product distribution. In the context of this study, the protonation mechanism of copper-triazolide was investigated with quantum mechanical calculations to have a deeper understanding of the mechanism. In aprotic conditions where the alkyne is considered as proton donor, the key finding of DFT calculations performed in this study is that the activation energy barrier for the protonation step is greater than the cycloaddition step. In the absence of a strong proton donor the final protonation step is coupled with the alkyne deprotonation step in the catalytic cycle, which slows down the reaction. A conceivable pathway for acetic acid promoted CuAAC reaction on the basis of experimental and computational studies was also sought. With acetate as ligand, cycloaddition is a facile reaction and the energetics shows that it speeds up the cycloaddition step. Acetic acid in CuAAC reaction provides proton for the final protonation step in the catalytic cycle, decouples the protonation/deprotonation step by acting as a strong proton donor in the last step and facilitates protonation. The energetics presented herein are in accordance with the experimental proposals on rate-determining step in aprotic conditions and decreased reaction times obtained in the experiments in the presence of acetic acid.",

The raw and modified catalysts were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDX, X-ray mapping, DRS, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and BET techniques. The calcined catalysts at 600\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h showed the best photocatalytic activity in metronidazole (MZ) aqueous solution. Based on the EIS results, this catalyst has the best charge transfer efficiency with respect to other catalysts calcined at lower and higher temperatures. This caused to lower e/h recombination and hence higher photodegradation activity. The mole ratio of ZnO/SnO2 affects the degradation activity of the catalysts so the best activities were obtained for the ZnO2.4-SnO2(2.0)/NC (ZS-NC) and ZnO3.3-SnO2(2.0)/NC (Z2S-NC) catalysts at pH 3. Cyclic voltammograms of the modified carbon paste electrodes with ZS-NC and Z2S-NC showed increased peak current in phosphate buffer which confirm formation of the ZnO and SnO2 semiconductors inside NC. Also, peak current dependence of the modified electrode to MZ concentration confirmed that the degradation extent of MZ can be estimated by electrochemical methods.",

Here, we report the synthesis of 2-methoxy-6-acetylnaphthalene from 2-methoxynaphthalene with a high selectivity and a high conversion under an unprecedented simple reaction system; acetic anhydride as an acetylating agent, acetic acid as a solvent, and proton-type zeolite catalysts with low acidity. Among the examined zeolites, a proton-type H-MOR (SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a0200) with a low acid content shows a conversion of 82% and an 86% selectivity for 2-methoxy-6-acetylnaphthalene.

The Co/P-Al2O3 catalysts having a different P/Al molar ratio were investigated to elucidate the roles of phosphorous species on the \u03b3-Al2O3 to the catalytic stability and product distribution for CO hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. The \u03b3-Al2O3 surface was partially transformed to aluminum phosphates after phosphorous modification, and the newly formed aluminum phosphate phases simultaneously altered the surface hydrophilicity and cobalt dispersion as well. The partial formation of tridymite aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) phases on the P-Al2O3 support eventually enhanced the dispersion of the supported cobalt crystallites and suppressed the aggregation of cobalt nanoparticles by forming the strongly interacted cobalt crystallites on the P-Al2O3 surfaces. The phosphorous-modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalyst also significantly suppressed heavy hydrocarbon depositions due to an increased surface hydrophilicity originated from partially formed SiO2-like tridymite AlPO4 surfaces. A higher stability of the Co/P-Al2O3 catalyst at an optimal phosphorous content in the range of 0.5\u20131.0 mol% was attributed to homogeneously distributed cobalt crystallites and less deposition of heavy hydrocarbons by forming macro-emulsion droplets with the help of trace amount of alcohols formed during FTS reaction. This was confirmed by in-situ analysis of adsorbed intermediates with surface hydrophilicity and some surface characterizations such as crystallite size, reducibility, and electronic state of the supported cobalt nanoparticles.",

Dilution of a calcined sample by the support led to a sharp increase of both hydrogen storage by the support and catalytic activity.

A series of characterizations revealed that dispersion of copper increases with an increase in nickel loading on \u0263-Al2O3 due to strong interaction between nickel and copper oxide particles. This also led to the formation of mixed copper-nickel oxides in calcined catalysts at the highest loading of nickel and copper (i.e. Cu/Ni\u00a0=\u00a01). In catalytic activity, both the monometallic Cu/\u0263-Al2O3 and Ni/\u0263-Al2O3 showed lower activity and selectivity towards hydrogenation of both Furfural and 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2-methylfuran (2-MF) and 2, 5-dimethylfuran (DMF), respectively.

Furthermore, combination of Cu/Ni ratios and temperature plays a significant role in the product distribution, as in the case of furfural hydrogenation, at a lower temperature, furfuryl alcohol (FOL) appears as the main product while at a higher temperature, 2-methylfuran (2-MF) is found to be the dominant product over Cu-Ni/\u0263-Al2O3 (Cu/Ni\u00a0=\u00a01) catalysts.

Lower photocatalytic degradation efficiency of RB19 in the presence of oxalate anion and p-benzoquinone indicated the crucial role of photogenerated holes and superoxide anion-radicals in photocatalysis on Gd-doped Ag3PO4. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity was attributed to scavenge the photoexcited electrons, and to suppress their recombination with holes and generation of active oxygen species. A nonlinear empirical kinetic model was introduced to predict the apparent first order rate constant (kapp) as a function of operational parameters, including initial RB19 concentration, Gd-doped Ag3PO4 dosage and light intensity.

The developed Pd/MagSBA showed excellent catalytic performance at comparatively low temperature range of 70\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C. The catalyst made the oxidation of BzOH milder, purification simpler and less pollution caused. Effects of the palladium loadings, reaction temperature, and stirring rates on their catalytic activity of benzaldehyde conversion were studied. It was found that the designed catalysts were recoverable by simple magnetic separation and were reusable without significant loss of catalytic activity. In addition, the reaction kinetics of the catalytic oxidation was investigated, showing that the reaction was zero order and the calculated activation energy was 50.08\u00a0kJ/mol.",

In this study, a kind of immobilized Ru based catalyst for the hydrogenation of DMO has been developed. The catalyst was synthesized by covalently bonding a ruthenium complex onto the modified-SiO2 surface, which was modified by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH550), through coordination interaction with aminosilane ligands. Compared with the traditional Ru/SiO2 catalyst, the immobilized Ru-NH2-SiO2 catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic performance and high stability towards hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to MG at temperatures as low as 80\u00a0\u00b0C. The yield of MG was 86.8% over Ru-NH2-SiO2 catalyst, while the yield of MG was only 34.5% over Ru/SiO2 catalyst. A series of characterization revealed that the excellent catalytic performance of Ru-NH2-SiO2 was resulted from the superior dispersion of Ru NPs on the surface of support and the electron-rich state of Ru centers.",

The unique features of CO2 mediated medium such as low viscosity, low surface tension and high diffusivity were beneficial to the uniform carbon coating on CdS surface. For the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants of RhB dye, phenol and dimethyl phthalate, the porous C/CdS catalyst prepared in the presence of CO2 (denoted as C/CdS-CO2) exhibited more excellent catalytic performance and stability under visible light than pure CdS and the reference C/CdS-E synthesized in ethanol without CO2 presence. The remarkable enhancements of photocatalytic activity and stability were ascribed to the multifunctional roles of the porous carbon coated CdS composites. Due to the uniform porous C coating layer, the adsorption capability to organic pollutants was enriched, the absorption to visible light was enhanced, the separation efficiency of photoinduced charges was accelerated, the photocorrosion of CdS and the toxicity leaching of Cd2+ were inhibited, which integrally contributed to the enhanced catalytic activity and stability of the C/CdS-CO2 composites. Besides, a possible photodegradation process for the pollutants over porous C/CdS-CO2 composites was tentatively proposed based on the experimental results.",

The XRD, EPR and also TPD of H2O results indicated the formation of oxygen vacancies when Zn was added to m-ZrO2. These results showed that Zn replaces Zr in the m-ZrO2 lattice forming a surface solid solution (ZnxZr1\u2212xO2\u2212y).

     "abstract": "Although UV-induced TiO2 photocatalysis involves the generation of several reactive oxygen species (ROS), the formation of hydroxyl radicals is generally associated with the degradation of persistent organic contaminants in water. In this study, a variety of radical scavengers were employed to discriminate the roles of different ROS during visible light-activated (VLA) photocatalysis using nitrogen and fluorine doped TiO2 (NF-TiO2) in the degradation of the hepatotoxin, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in water. The addition of hydroxyl radical scavengers, methanol and tert-butyl alcohol to the reaction mixture resulted in negligible inhibition of NF-TiO2 photocatalytic degradation of MC-LR at pH 3.0 and only partial inhibition at pH 5.7 under visible light. While hydroxyl radicals (OH) generally play the primary role in UV-TiO2 photocatalysis, the minimal influence of MeOH and t-BuOH on the degradation process under these experimental conditions indicates that OH are not crucial in VLA NF-TiO2 photocatalysis. However, strong inhibition was observed in VLA NF-TiO2 photocatalytic degradation of MC-LR in the presence of superoxide dismutase, benzoquinone and catalase at pH 3.0 and 5.7 indicating that O2\u2212 and H2O2 play critical roles in the degradation process. Similar degradation rates were observed in the presence of deuterium oxide, which enhances singlet oxygen mediated processes further suggesting singlet oxygen is not a key species in the degradation of MC-LR. Formic acid and cupric nitrate were added to probe the roles of the valence band holes and conduction band electrons, respectively. Under UV\u2013vis light irradiation, almost complete inhibition of MC-LR removal is observed with NF-TiO2 in the presence of OH scavengers at pH 5.7. These results demonstrate that the solution pH plays a major role in the formation and reactivity of ROS during VLA NF-TiO2 photocatalysis. The adsorption strength of scavengers and MC-LR onto NF-TiO2 as well as the speciation of ROS as a function of pH needs to be carefully considered since they also play a major role in the efficiency of the process. These results indicate that the reduction of molecular oxygen by photo-generated electrons rather than hydroxyl radicals produced by oxidative reactions of photo-generated holes is the key factor in the VLA NF-TiO2 photocatalytic degradation of MC-LR.",

Iron carbide catalysts achieved stronger CO adsorption and higher BET surface area than Fe3O4 catalysts, which resulted in higher CO conversion.

TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) were prepared by hydrothermal method with larger specific surface area (364.2\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121), and CdTeSe@TNTs were synthesized by in situ process. The absorption edge of CdTeSe@TNTs is red shifted significantly toward 697\u00a0nm.

The results showed that substituting Ni2+ in the structure by Mg2+ ions significantly increased the surface basicity of the catalysts.

Varied alcohols were tested and discussed in the reaction system to verify the effect, and the results indicated that the activity of \u03b1-CH bond is the key factor for the benzyl alcohol derivatives, while the first base-acid reaction step may be more important for aliphatic alcohols. The comparison results between the hydrotalcites and the calcined samples showed that the type of basic site have significantly influence on the catalytic activity, and only the Br\u00f8nsted OH basic sites accelerate the oxidation.

The structure and morphology of the fabricated composite nanofibers were characterized by FTIR, SEM, TEM, TGA, and XPS. The results indicate that the composite nanofibers possess excellent photoreduction performance for Cr(VI) under visible light (125\u00a0W) after 30\u00a0min, which is much faster than previous reports. The effects of various experimental parameters such as catalyst dose, irradiation time, initial concentration of Cr(VI), and pH on the photoreduction efficiency of Cr(VI) were investigated. The highest photoreduction efficiency of Cr (VI) was obtained at low acidity and low amount of TiO2/CNT photocatalyst. The kinetic experimental data was attained and fitted well with a pseudo-first-order model. The UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer and XPS analyses proved that chromate Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III). In addition, it can be concluded that the addition of the phenol enhances the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). Furthermore, the photoreduction mechanism has also been discussed. Finally, the fabricated composite nanofibers were found to be stable after at least five regeneration cycles.",

Structural analysis reveals that complex 1 is a di-\u03bc2-phenoxo-bridged dinuclear Ni(II) complex and has an additional syn-syn benzoate bridge. Enzyme kinetic studies reflect that it (1) is effective in mimicking catecholase like activity with 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (3,5-DTBC) as the substrate. Kinetic measurements suggest that the rate of catechol oxidation follows first order kinetics with respect to the catalyst. The possible intermediates during the course of reaction are identified from ESI\u2013MS spectra. The characteristic EPR spectra of the complex in the presence of 3,5-DTBC supports the formation of nickel(II)-semiquinonate as an intermediate species during the catalytic oxidation. When the synthesis is carried out with Ni(II) : HL ratio of 3:2, a different compound [Ni3L2(PhCOO)4] (2) is produced incorporating an additional Ni(II)-benzoate. 2 possesses a linear trinuclear structure with the tridentate reduced Schiff base ligand coordinated to the terminal nickel atoms which are linked to the central Ni(II) by phenoxo and carboxylate bridges. Unlike 1, it does not show any catalytic activity towards catechol oxidation. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements have also been performed for 1 and 2. Complex 1 indicates the presence of intradimer antiferromagnetic interactions (J\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.65\u00a0cm\u22121).

The catalytic reaction mechanism over Ag-CuCl2/BaCO3 catalyst follows Rideal-Eley mechanism, in which propylene in the gas phase reacts with molecular oxygen species adsorbed on the surface of Ag at the interface in close contact with CuCl2 to produce PO, and with atomic oxygen species adsorbed on the surface of Ag nanoparticles to produce CO2 and H2O. One oxygen atom of molecular oxygen species reacts with propylene to form a PO molecule, and the left insufficient oxygen atoms react with propylene to produce oxygen-containing intermediates and then to form coke deposition which covers the active sites and thus results in the catalyst deactivation. The deactivated Ag-CuCl2/BaCO3 catalyst can be completely regenerated by combustion of coke deposition and then impregnation with appropriate amount of Cl.",

Additionally, the amplification experiment in a 5.0\u00a0L stainless steel reactor also verified the reliability of this transesterification process with MgO as catalyst, giving maximum Mw value for PBC as high as 208 600\u00a0g/mol. It was found that medium and strong basic sites were responsible for this transesterification process. Simultaneously, strong basic sites also could favor the decomposition and depolymerization of the resultant PBC, leading to the decrease for Mw and yield at higher temperature. In addition, based on the experimental results and relevant literature, a plausible reaction mechanism involving the activation of diols via the abstraction of proton with basic site over MgO was proposed for this process.",

As the radical probe compound, benzoic acid (BA) degradation was completely achieved after 25\u00a0min in the nZVC/H2O2 system at initial pH 3.0. H2O2 can accelerate the corrosion of nZVC to release Cu+ resulting in the further activation of H2O2via a Fenton-like reaction in acidic aqueous solution. The released Cu+ during the corrosion of nZVC is the main effective copper species to activate H2O2 to produce OH in the nZVC/H2O2 system. Hydroxyl radical (OH) was verified as the primary reactive oxidant which is responsible for BA degradation in the nZVC/H2O2 system owing to the intense inhibition of BA degradation with the addition of excess tert-butyl alcohol (TBA). Moreover, acidic aqueous solution facilitates the degradation of BA and optimum initial pH for BA degradation is 3.0. Higher nZVC dosage could enhance the degradation rate of BA. In addition, the present study put forward an interesting idea to make full use of intermediate Cu+ to activate H2O2 during corrosion of nZVC to degrade organic contaminants.",

     "abstract": "Vanadium(III) complex bearing PMePh2 ligand has been synthesized, fully-characterized and investigated for homo- and co-polymerization of ethylene with norbornene, in combination with aluminum compounds, i.e., methylaluminoxane (MAO) and Et2AlCl. The results are carefully compared with those obtained with VCl3(THF)3 and VCl3 in the presence and absence of ethyltrichloroacetate (ETA), and free phosphine. VCl3(PMePh2)2 was likely activated through a dissociative mechanism where the dissociation of the labile phosphine ligand was the first and possibly the rate-determining step. The activity of VCl3(THF)3 was slightly higher than that of VCl3(PMePh2)2 likely due to a different competition of re-insertion rate of dissociated ligand compared to the insertion/coordination of (co)monomers. Copolymers obtained at low norbornene feedstock concentration from VCl3(THF)3, showed greater non-uniformity in terms of composition distribution with respect to those from VCl3(PMePh2)2 because of a more pronounced compositional drift in the semi-batch polymerization process. This strongly affects the copolymer\u2019s thermal properties, the copolymers from VCl3(PMePh2)2 exhibiting higher Tgs. The effect of PMePh2 and THF ligand on reactions responsible for chain growth termination, affecting the copolymers molecular weight, is discussed. Control over the norbornene incorporation and molecular weight of the resultant copolymers proved to be possible by changing the polymerization temperature, and ETA loading.In addition, ad-hoc. experiments, designed to ensure the uniformity of the catalytic copolymerization process even in the presence of the observed relevant (and unavoidable) compositional drift were performed, and copolymers microstructure and catalytic mechanisms were thoroughly investigated. Due to the peculiar features of the catalytic systems, these studies could be performed only after appropriate modifications to well established methods were developed. As a by-product of these investigations, general and original computational methods are proposed, whose applicability goes beyond the cases treated here.",

The results show that the atmosphere during ion exchange and calcination significantly affects the cation exchange capacity and the nature of the Fe species in Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts. An air atmosphere was conducive to improving the ability of ZSM-5 zeolites for Fe ionic exchange. However, isolated Fe3+ sites were dominant in Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst (Fe-Z(N2)) prepared under a N2 atmosphere, and small oligomeric FexOy clusters and FexOy nano-particles were markedly increased in Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst prepared in air, resulting in the higher SCR activity and wide temperature window of Fe-Z(N2). Moreover, Fe-Z(N2) catalyst possessed more Br\u00f8nsted acid sites and could adsorb more NH3 species, promoting its SCR activity. In situ DRIFT studies showed that NH3 can be adsorbed on both Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis acid sites on Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst, and this adsorbed NH3 can react with gaseous NOx. Additionally, NOx can be adsorbed on Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst, mainly as a bidentate nitrate, but these nitrate species cannot be confirmed to react with gaseous NH3 because of the overlap with the strong absorption band of adsorbed NH3 species. Based on the IR results and weak adsorption of NOx over Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, it was concluded that NH3-SCR over this Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst predominantly follows the Eley-Rideal reaction mechanism.",

The latter proceeded auto-oxidation reaction to afford the pyridine derivatives. The observed sequential catalysis over Au-L1 proved more efficient than that over the mechanical mixtures of the Au-complex (Au-L2) and N-methylimidazole, because the free N-methylimidazole as an N-containing donor competed with the alkyne substrate to coordinate to Au-center.

Investigation of concerted and stepwise pathways for benzene methylation by methanol showed that the energy barriers of benzene methylation calculated in concerted pathway are 129\u00a0kJ/mol for HZSM-11 and 149\u00a0kJ/mol for HZSM-5. In the case of stepwise pathway, the achieved energy barriers of formation of the methoxy group and benzene methylation over HZSM-11 are 153 and 93\u00a0kJ/mol (vs. 149 and 97\u00a0kJ/mol over HZSM-5), respectively. The energy values obtained over both zeolites are similar, in good agreement with their analogous topologies.

     "abstract": "The combination of graphene and semiconductor photocatalysts such as graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely demonstrated as an effective strategy to improve the H2-evolution performance of photocatalysts. However, owing to the hydrophobicity of graphene, the green synthesis of well-suspended graphene/g-C3N4 in the absence of surfactant or additives is still a challenge. In this study, the suspended reduced-graphene-oxide-modified g-C3N4 (rGO/g-C3N4) photocatalysts were fabricated through an in situ hydrothermal synthesis route, which includes a facile preparation of well-coupled GO/g-C3N4 precursor and its following in situ transformation to form the rGO/g-C3N4 by a hydrothermal reduction method. It was found that the obtained rGO/g-C3N4 photocatalysts showed a cotton-like structure and could be well suspended in water owing to the well coupling between rGO and g-C3N4 nanosheets, which is quite favorable for the photocatalytic reactions in an aqueous solution system. After loading Pt cocatalyst as the active site for H2 evolution reaction, the rGO/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts exhibited an obviously improved performance (ca. 23.7%) by the addition of a small amount of rGO (0.08%), compared with the pure g-C3N4. The improved photocatalytic H2-evolution performance of rGO/g-C3N4 composite can be attributed the synergistic effect of rGO nanosheets and Pt nanoparticles, namely, rGO nanosheet acts as an electron-transfer mediator to rapidly capture the photogenerated electrons from the g-C3N4 and then transfer to the Pt cocatalyst, while the Pt nanoparticle functions as a reduction active site to promote the H2-evolution reaction effectively. Considering its green preparation and high photocatalytic performance, the present synthesis route of suspended rGO/g-C3N4 may provide new insights into design and fabrication for other composite materials with various potential applications.",

     "abstract": "Palladium catalysts supported on manganese oxides octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2), Pb doped OMS-2 (Pb-OMS-2) and perovskite-type La0.5Pb0.5MnO3 were prepared for investigating the deactivation causes of catalysts during the oxidative carbonylation of phenol. The catalytic experiments on three different sets of catalysts demonstrated that they were inactive after continuous reaction for 22\u00a0h. XRD patterns and HRTEM images demonstrated that carbonaceous pollution and palladium leaching occurred during the reaction process. The solvent and oxygen have significant impact on the palladium leaching by ICP-AES analysis. In addition, hot filtration tests and SH-HZSM-5 adsorption studies indicated that the leached palladium species are not active species. The results of XPS patterns and H2-TPR profiles showed that aggregation and reduction of Pd species was another deactivation cause. It was discovered that lattice oxygen species decreased and palladium aggregated, which hindered the re-oxidation of Pd(0) to Pd(II). In summary, carbonaceous pollution, Pd leaching, aggregation and consumption of oxygen species hindered the redox recycling of palladium, which resulted in the deactivation of supported palladium catalysts for the oxidative carbonylation of phenol.",

This work intends to investigate the effect of PHF on the heterogeneous photo-Fenton activity of ferrihydrite (Fh). PHF/ferrihydrite (PHF/Fh) composites were prepared and their photo-Fenton activities in the degradation of acid red 18 under simulated sunlight irradiation were examined. The structural characteristics of the as-synthesized samples were studied using XRD, SEM-EDS, SPM, DRS, and N2 adsorption-desorption. The results showed that PHF/Fh had much higher catalytic activities than Fh, and appropriate contents of PHF on PHF/Fh could enhance the stability of Fh. In addition, the presence of PHF on PHF/Fh could enhance the production of 1O2 and OH as compared with pure Fh. We propose that the excited state PHF could efficiently sensitize the ground state O2 to generate 1O2, and at the same time could transfer electrons to the Fe3+ on Fh, leading to an accelerated reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. As a result, the decomposition of H2O2 (by Fe2+) into OH could be promoted as well. On the other hand, based on the results of GAMESS calculation and GC\u2013MS analysis, the degradation pathway of AR18 was further proposed.",

A platinum catalyst was immobilized on these microspheres. At every stage of the microspheres modification they were characterized by spectroscopy methods as well as by SEM microscopy. The catalyst appears only in the form of Pt(II) complex. The Pt(0) form was obtained by reducing this complex using sodium borohydride.

In both of these reactions the new platinum catalysts were recycled several times with the retention of their high catalytic activity. The hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde leads to two products hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCA) and 3-phenyl-1-propanol (PP). The comparison of the rate of formation of the products with the rate of HCA and cinnamyl alcohol (CA) hydrogenation indicates that neither HCA nor CA are intermediate in the main pathway of the formation of PP.",

The ethanol plays a role of reducing agent of MoO3 because the latter is stable under hydrogen atmosphere up to 823\u00a0K.

     "abstract": "It has been reported widely that Rh-Mn-Li/SiO2 catalysts can exhibit high selectivity to C2+ oxygenates during CO hydrogenation, with promoters of Mn and Li playing an important role in this behavior. In this study, a series catalysts of Rh-Mn-Li/SiO2 with different amounts of Mn and Li were prepared, and the new insights into the effects of Mn and Li on the mechanistic pathway for C2+ oxygenates synthesis from syngas were investigated. The XPS analysis showed that Rh existed mainly as metallic Rh after reduction, however partially positively charged Rh\u03b4+ atoms appeared on the surface of Mn-containing catalyst due to the interaction of Rh-Mn. The results of H2-TPR indicated that both of Li and Mn can inhibit the reduction of Rh2O3. With the increase in the ratio of Mn/Rh, the most effective interaction, associated to the presence of two reduction centers of Rh2O3, was obtained when the ratio of Mn/Rh\u00a0=\u00a01. In situ-FTIR was used to probe the effects of Mn and Li on CO absorption and hydrogenation. With regards to the CO adsorption, the doping of Mn can enhance the CO adsorption ability of Rh and weaken the CO-Rh bond strength very effectively when the amount of Mn reached 1.5\u00a0wt.%. Improved capacity of CO adsorption is conducive to increase of CO conversion, while the weakening of CO-Rh bond is beneficial to the CO insertion reaction, thus contributing to the generation of C2+ oxygenates. Moreover, the low amount of Li (\u22640.075\u00a0wt.%) can also enhance the CO adsorption, resulting in the improvement of reactivity. On the other hand, Mn and Li promoted dissociation of H2, which is favorable to an increase in the rate of hydrogenation. But an opposite effect appeared at high content of Mn (>1.5\u00a0wt.%). As the optimized results, when Rh, Mn, Li content was 1.5\u00a0wt.%, 1.5\u00a0wt.% and 0.075\u00a0wt.%, the catalyst for CO hydrogenation of C2+ oxygenates achieved the best performance of C2+ oxygenates synthesis.",

Two different reaction routes, \u201cL-H\u201d mechanism via \u201cNH4NO3\u00a0+\u00a0NO\u201d at low temperatures (<200\u00a0\u00b0C) and \u201cE-R\u201d mechanism via \u201cNH2\u00a0+\u00a0NO\u201d at high temperatures (>350\u00a0\u00b0C), are presented. The niobia addition increases the surface acidity and promotes the formation of nitrates species at low temperatures. In this way, the reaction between the ads-NH3 and nitrates species is accelerated to form NH4NO3 intermediates, which then decompose to N2 and H2O. The reaction of the ads-NH3 species with gaseous NOx at high temperatures is also promoted due to the enhanced acidity and weakened thermal stability of nitrates after niobia loading.",

In this work we fabricated porous TiO2 microspheres through a hydrothermal process followed by photochemical reduction of noble metal nanoparticles at the TiO2 surface. The morphology and structure of M-TiO2 spheres (M\u00a0=\u00a0Ag, Au, Pt and Pd) were studied with the use of various techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD), photoluminescence (PL) and UV\u2013vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The effect of metal amount (from 0.1 to 1\u00a0wt.%.) on the photocatalytic activity during toluene degradation in gas phase and phenol degradation in aqueous phase was investigated. Additionally, the photocatalytic activity of the M-TiO2 samples was evaluated by measuring the formation rate of photo-induced hydroxyl radicals (OH) under UV\u2013vis light irradiation using coumarin as a probe. The obtained results indicated that toluene could be mostly removed from the air over TiO2 microspheres modified with Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd nanoparticles. UV-mediated photoreactivity was almost similar for all samples obtained by loading metals from solutions consisting of 0.1 and 1\u00a0wt.% of metal precursors. Under visible light, except for Au, in gas phase toluene oxidation, the optimized loading of the metals was 0.1\u00a0wt.-% (photoreactivity changed in order: Ag-TiO2\u00a0\u2248\u00a0Pd-TiO2>\u00a0Pt-TiO2\u00a0>>\u00a0Au-TiO2).

K/bulk-MoS2 is used as a control catalyst to provide insight into the role of K/MoS2 and K/MoS2-MMO sites on higher alcohol formation pathways. Analysis of the products via 13C NMR show preferential enrichment of terminal carbons in C3\u2013C4 alcohols with both co-feeds, suggesting that CO insertion is the primary higher alcohol synthesis pathway, and that olefin carbonylation proceeds through the same pathway as alcohol formation. The observation of 13C4-1-butanol species during the CO hydrogenation reactions with 13C2-ethanol co-feeds provides conclusive evidence of ethanol self-coupling to 1-butanol as a secondary pathway. Additionally, acetate species are shown to be formed via an acyl precursor reacting with an alkoxy anion. Hydrogenation of an acetyl species (CH3CO*) to an ethoxy intermediate (C2H5O*) is shown to be largely irreversible under the reaction conditions employed, as no preferential enrichment is observed for the acetyl group in acetate species. Propionate species are shown to be formed via esterification of propionate with the corresponding alcohol, while isobutyl alcohol formation observed over both the K/bulk-MoS2 and the MMO supported catalysts occurs via methanol coupling with 1-propanol or 1-propanol derived species.",

EPR studies further revealed important information regarding the coordination geometry and interaction with CO2 of surface cobalt sites in the hybrid photocatalysts.",

Theoretically, density functional theory calculations are used to explore the potential energy surface of the reactions, providing insight into the mechanisms. Our combined approach allows us to show that the reactions with the sulfoxides take place with the enolate instead of the enol intermediates. The addition mechanisms are evaluated computing the transition states of the reactions between enolates of \u03b2-ketosulfones and \u03b2-ketosulfoxides with the iminium ion of different catalysts. In the reactions with \u03b2-ketosulfoxides, the experiments found a high enantio \u2013 and diastereoselectivity; this is explained with the kinetic control exerted by the difference in the energetic barriers as given by the calculations. In the case of \u03b2-ketosulfones a low diastereoselectivity was experimentally observed. In this case, similar energy barriers in the two studied pathways are obtained. In both cases (\u03b2-keto-sulfones and -sulfoxides), the interaction of both reactants leads to a weakly bounded complex previous to the reaction, in which the orientation determines the stereoselectivity obtained in the products.",

The adsorption of relevant species for CO2/CO hydrogenation were studied on Cu(111) surfaces doped with Ga, Mg, and Ti. Preferred adsorption sites, geometries, and binding energies for relevant intermediates were determined. A systematic study of the thermochemistry of plausible surface reactions for CO2/CO hydrogenation on Ga/Cu(111), Mg/Cu(111), and Ti/Cu(111) was performed to postulate reaction mechanisms for the synthesis of formic acid, formaldehyde, and methanol.

CO2 is activated by chemisorption on Mg/Cu(111) and Ti/Cu(111), but the latter surface has a strong interaction with O, which inhibits the last reaction steps and the desorption of the products. Our results demonstrate that the thermochemistry of CO2 hydrogenation for the synthesis of the different products varies drastically depending on the dopant on Cu(111).

The present results indicated that comparing with large size commercial red phosphorus particles, NRP possesses higher specific surface area and photocatalytic activity.

The results indicated that the increasing pH facilitated the nucleation of BiOBr, leading to the decrease of crystallite size. Moreover, due to the change of {001} facets exposure, the BiOBr nanosheets rotated to reduce the total surface energy of crystal and formed looser structure, even assembled into flower-like structure at pH 7. The photocatalytic activity evaluated by the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) was positively correlated with the initial pH value.

The Ni species interaction with support was investigated by TPR and by performing five catalyst recycling tests. After catalyst activation by reduction, the increase of Ni particle size with an increase of Ni loading was relatively small (from 6.9 to 8.9\u00a0nm) due to enhance of the metal-support interaction.

The XRD analysis of precursors demonstrates that, compared with the sample prepared by conventional batch reactor, more Zn2+ are incorporated into malachite structure, which is attributed to the relatively uniform distribution of Cu, Zn elements in initial precipitates caused by the excellent mixing performance of the microchannel reactor. Higher decomposition temperature of carbonate species trapped in the interfaces between CuO and ZnO and higher binding energy of Cu2p3/2 indicate that sample prepared by the new reactor possess a stronger interface interaction, which derives from the more intimate contact between oxide components. This supposition is confirmed by the HRTEM images and the stronger interface interaction in the final reduced catalyst can improve catalytic performance on methanol synthesis.",

The as-prepared hybrid showed enhanced light absorption in the visible light region compared to pure g-C3N4, and possessed a type-II heterojunction structure. The photocatalytic properties of these hybrids were evaluated through the photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation.

In order to clarify the effects of the kind of precious metal and treatment process in the catalyst preparation on the propene epoxidation and the hydrogen peroxide decomposition, TS-1 was impregnated with gold and palladium via drying, calcination and reduction and the experiments to check its catalytic performance were conducted in a gas aspirating autoclave reactor in the absence of mass transfer limitations. The presence of precious metals vigorously catalyzed the side reactions and hydrogen peroxide decomposition. Some of the precious metal containing TS-1 catalysts showed high initial rates but there was no catalyst with a propene oxide yield after 5\u00a0h reaction time comparable to TS-1 alone because of the enhancement of side reactions by precious metals. The significant decline in the selectivity to propene oxide over the dried precious metal containing TS-1 catalysts was attributed to the leaching of precious metals into the reaction medium. Palladium containing TS-1 showed exceptionally high decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Reduction and calcination increased the decomposition by forming metallic gold and palladium. Homogeneous dispersion of gold nanoparticles was achieved by a sol immobilization method which led to a decrease of propene oxide selectivity and an increase of hydrogen peroxide decomposition.",

Distinct tendencies in reaction behavior between primary and secondary alcohols were found and the lower reactivity of secondary alcohols could clearly be attributed to electronic properties, along with steric hindrance.Furthermore, the influence of double bonds in the alcohol chain has been studied. Interestingly, alcohols with double bonds that are not conjugated to the hydroxyl groups were shown to be more active than saturated alcohols. Allylic alcohols, however, are significantly less reactive than their saturated analogs.With the gathered information, we were able to deduce a structure reactivity-relationship of certain functional groups and substitution patterns.

With this purpose, the preparation and characterization of catalysts based on Beta nanozeolites were described in this work, aiming to find active and selective catalysts to produce biofuels through the cracking of crude soybean oil. The samples were prepared by using different organosilanes such as phenylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane (PHAPTMS), phenyltrimethoxysilane (PHMTS) and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to functionalize the Beta zeolite seeds. The silanized seeds produced solids with smaller crystallites, more framework aluminum and different textural and acidic properties as compared to the Beta nanozeolite prepared without organosilane. APTES produced the solid with the smallest crystallites while PHAPTMS produced the sample with the highest external area, the differences being related to agglomeration of nanoparticles, generating voids related to the size of organosilane chains. The catalysts showed different selectivities during the cracking of crude soybean oil, depending on the organosilane used in the preparation. This finding was related to the different acidic properties and to the different particles size and porosity of the solids. The Beta nanozeolite obtained without any organosilane produced more gaseous compounds (C2\u2013C4), due to the largest percentage of strong acidic sites, whereas those obtained with organosilanes were more selective to liquid hydrocarbons. The sample prepared with APTES was the most active and selective to hydrocarbons in the range of gasoline, diesel and kerosene, because of its smallest crystallite size and low acidity, as well as to the agglomeration of nanoparticles, which facilitates the hydrogen transfer reactions. Moreover, the sample prepared with PHMTS was the most selective to hydrocarbons in the gasoline range (C5\u2013C11) while that obtained with PHAPTMS was the most selective to oxygenates. These changes were related to the combined effects of crystallite sizes, porosity and acidity on the catalytic properties of the solids, in the different pathways of the complex reaction network of cracking of soybean oil. It was shown that different organosilanes allowed tailoring the catalytic properties of Beta nanozeolites to produce biofuels or chemicals for several applications.",

In this work the acetol oxidation by homogeneous cheap and green catalytic system FeCl3/H2O2 has been studied. Acetonitrile or water was used as solvent. Acetol (0.5\u00a0M) gave acetic acid (0.25\u00a0M) and formic acid (0.35\u00a0M) as the main products. Some amount of CO2 was also detected. For quantification of the CO2 amount, a novel method has been developed which uses GC\u2013MS for monitoring the signals produced by the CO2 and argon (used as internal standard) present in the headspace of the reaction vessel. The formation of 0.028\u00a0M CO2 after 4\u00a0h under typical conditions was demonstrated. The effects of reactant concentration on the initial reaction rate were studied. The experiments in atmosphere of 16O2 and 16O2\u00a0+\u00a018O2 led to the conclusion that molecular oxygen from atmosphere takes part in the reaction and these atoms are incorporated into the products.",

CVD grown pristine hollow carbon spheres (HCSs), N-doped HCSs (NHCSs) and B-doped HCSs (BHCSs) were used to prepare composites with TiO2 nanoparticles. The presence of B and N doping in these carbonaceous materials was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The composite films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV\u2013vis spectroscopy and electron microscopy techniques. In the photoelectrochemical studies, the influence of the addition of NHCSs or BHCSs in the TiO2 matrix was evaluated and compared with a pristine TiO2 film. The TiO2/NHCS (0.5\u00a0wt%) composite electrode exhibited a 2.4 increase in anodic current density compared to the pure TiO2 electrode; it also showed an enhanced incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and good photoelectrochemical stability over time. The EIS analysis at open circuit conditions showed that the irradiated TiO2/NHCS electrode exhibited smaller resistance values (R1\u00a0=\u00a043\u00a0\u03a9 and R2\u00a0=\u00a03.1\u00a0k\u03a9) than the irradiated TiO2/BHCS electrode (3.3\u00a0k\u03a9 and 10\u00a0k\u03a9). From the experimental results, we propose a photocatalytic mechanism for the NHCS/TiO2 and BHCS/TiO2 composites as a photoanode. The presence of p-type BHCSs between the n-type TiO2 nanoparticles impairs the photocatalytic processes by the formation of a p-n diode with enhanced resistance and recombination. On the other hand, an appreciable enhancement of photocurrent density was achieved for the NHCS/TiO2 composite films due to a combination of their electronic properties, crack free compact film morphology and enhanced light absorption.",

     "abstract": "Photocatalytic degradation of pollutant molecules delivered great challenges for sustainable development of green energy in the field of environmental science. For this purpose, growing interests have been made to witness the fast development of new photocatalysts with improved catalytic efficiency and to monitor the reaction mechanism at the atomic and molecular levels. Therefore, doping of semiconductor metal oxide (e.g. TiO2) with main group elements, especially with sulfur atoms (S), has gained much interest due to the introduction of a localized band between the conduction bands (CB) and valence bands (VB) that increase the absorbance in the visible light region. More interestingly, photocatalytic practices of the S-doped TiO2 material are of pronounced significance due to photon-to-carrier conversion ability of S-doping beneath the band gap energy region of pure TiO2. Therefore, visible-light-activated S-doped TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared via template free and low-temperature oxidant peroxide method (OPM) assisted hydrothermal treatments. Experimental findings have revealed the successful incorporation of sulfur atoms into TiO2 crystal lattice and, as a result, substitution of Ti4+ by S6+ to form TiOS bonds for cationic S-doping was observed. Whereas, in the case of anionic S-doping, substitution of S2\u2212 by O2\u2212 to form OTiS bonds was achieved. More evidence was observed for the presence of chemisorbed sulfate groups on the surface of S-doped TiO2 samples and inhibition of crystallite size growth by S-doping, and obviously, upsurge the absorbance in the visible light region. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared 1-D nanorods shaped photocatalysts and the mechanism involved for the photodegradation of organic molecules (methyl orange and phenol) under visible-light irradiation were investigated by adding different scavengers into the system solution to capture active species. It was found that in cationic S-doped TiO2 photocatalysts, chemisorbed hydroxyls (OHads\u2212) and photoinduced holes (h+) played a major role in photocatalysis. Whereas, in the case of anionic S-doped TiO2 photocatalysts, electrons (e\u2212) and photoinduced holes (h+) played the nearly equal role in photocatalysis.",

In this study, a facile hydrothermal method was used to incorporate BiOBr with \u03b1-Fe2O3 in an attempt to overcome the previously mentioned limitations of \u03b1-Fe2O3, and the synthesized composites were fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV\u2013vis diffuse-reflection spectroscopy (DRS). The BiOBr/\u03b1-Fe2O3 composite showed much higher visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity than the pure \u03b1-Fe2O3 and BiOBr for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation. Specifically, the composite synthesized at 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 18\u00a0h with a mass ratio of BiOBr to \u03b1-Fe2O3 5:10 performed the best. This work also explored the chemical mechanism and pathway of RhB degradation, and the roles of the oxidative species with the presence of BiOBr/\u03b1-Fe2O3 composites in the photocatalytic oxidation process, including holes (h+), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and superoxide radicals (O2\u2212).",

A considerable difference in isobutane solubility between ionic liquid and sulfuric acid was observed with ionic liquid having a greater tendency to dissolve isobutane at the start-up of alkylation. Deuterated product distributions indicate that trimethylpentane fractions stemmed primarily from the self-alkylation of isobutane, the direct alkylation reaction of C4 hydrocarbons, and the scission of C12+ intermediates.

The adsorption efficiency of CR on Ag3PO4 decreased with increasing initial solution pH, whereas its degradation efficiency increased with increasing solution pH value. This phenomenon was significantly different from conventional photocatalytic properties of most catalysts for heterogeneous photocatalysis of organic compounds in aqueous solution. Three other azo dyes, i.e. Methyl orange (MO), Methyl red (MR) and Orange II, were used to further confirm such an adsorption-degradation relationship of Ag3PO4/dye at different pH value of solution. The tested three dyes behaved similar to CR, and they showed unexceptionally higher adsorption behavior and lower degradation efficiency at low pH value or vice versa at high pH value. This special adsorption-degradation relationship for azo dyes with Ag3PO4 as visible-light catalyst was correlated with the OH group-related defects present on Ag3PO4 surface as determined by FTIR spectroscopy and surface fluorination method, implying that the defects played an important role for the visible-light photocatalysis of Ag3PO4 in water solution.",

After the first hour of reaction the acrolein selectivity was 36% and it reached steady state after 6\u00a0h at a selectivity of 73%.

The prepared nanocatalysts are characterized by various analyses such as XRD, FESEM, FTIR, EDX, and BET techniques. XRD results show that increasing ultrasonic power decreases CuO crystallite size and improves its dispersion. FESEM analysis shows that enhancement of ultrasonic power leads to better morphology and smaller particles with no agglomeration. EDX results prove the existence of all elements used in primary solution and also support the better dispersion of active elements on the nanocatalysts fabricated by higher ultrasonic power. Application of higher ultrasonic power during the coprecipitation synthesis method results higher surface area according to the BET analysis. Finally, the catalytic experiments represents that application of higher ultrasonic power for synthesis of nanocatalysts results higher hydrogen yield due to the better characteristic properties even at low temperatures.

It was observed that the p-cresols were activated by alkali to form phenolate salt to ensure mild reaction conditions demonstrated by comparing the oxidation of p-cresol and its phenolate sodium. It was also found that excess alkali improved the selectivity of aldehyde by inhibiting the formation of dimeric side products in view of an analysis of the side products distribution. The alkaline alcoholic anion facilitates the 1,6-addition reaction between p-benzoquinone methide and solvent. Thus, more alkali was needed in solvents with high pKa values and high water content. The detection of trace acid during the oxidation of p-cresols suggested the phenoxy radical mechanism rather than the classic benzyl radical mechanism proposed for interpreting the oxidation of non-hydroxyl aromatic hydrocarbons.

When dual-phase reaction was adopted, the maximal H2O2 concentration of 574.0\u00a0mM in aqueous phase was achieved with mesitylene as H-donor. As the produced H2O2 concentration in the industrial AO process is estimated as ca. 400\u00a0mM in one cycle, our method with the dual-phase reaction greatly promotes the possibility for the practical production of H2O2 with photocatalytic method.",

The experimental results show that the oxidation of BA into BAD is driven mainly by the holes and OH radical. The role of dissolved O2 was studied by bubbling N2 through the reaction. The results show that the dissolved O2 is, to some extent, the source of OH. Additional density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified two H-abstraction pathways (RabsOH and Rabs\u03b1). The structure of the RabsOH product is less stable and tends to transfer resulting in the Rabs \u03b1 product. The holes are the main driving force for the abstracting of H from BA. The OH radical combines with the H-abstract product to form a precursor of product BAD, detected by LC\u2013MS technique (m/z 123), which then undergoes an intramolecular dehydration reaction to form BAD. The results will help to select the optimal active species for the photocatalytic oxidation of BA into BAD on TiO2 under UV light.",

The Pd nanooctahedrons were impregnated on silica and tested in the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, through which we tried to elucidate the effects of the Pd nanooctahedron size on hydrogen peroxide productivity. The selectivity and productivity of H2O2 were closely related to the number of corner and edge atoms in the Pd nanooctahedron, because the water-forming side reactions were primarily promoted by those coordinatively unsaturated atoms. The addition of Br\u2212 ions to the reaction medium greatly enhanced the selectivity and productivity of H2O2 as the Br\u2212 ions deactivated the corner and edge atoms of Pd and suppressed the side reactions.

HOMO and LUMO energy level characteristics/redox potentials for ground (S0) and excited states (S1 singlet) of CoTPP have been calculated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). HOMO and LUMO energy levels enable sensitization of the tantalate, a typical wide band gap semi-conductor, with visible light. Visible light absorption by CoTPP results in the direct transfer of photo generated electrons to the conduction band of the tantalate, in addition to the intrinsic UV light excitation.

X-ray fluorescence, Hammett titration, and scanning transmission electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed that the gradual leaching of Al atoms from the borders of the platelets to their centers and acid site formation occurred when montmorillonite was subjected to an acid treatment. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that the metallocene complex was activated only on the borders of the acid-treated montmorillonite platelets. The most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the metallocene complex is activated by the acid sites formed on the borders of the platelets by the acid treatment of montmorillonite.",

The effect of the calcination temperature on the structure, physicochemical and catalytic properties of the Sm-Mn-O catalysts was investigated in detail. The results showed that the Sm-Mn-O catalyst calcined at 450\u00a0\u00b0C exhibited the highest activity, and after been calcined at >550\u00a0\u00b0C its catalytic activity markedly decreased. With an increase in the calcination temperature, its surface area firstly increased and then decreased, and the poorly crystallized MnO2 in Sm-Mn-O was transformed to highly crystalized Mn2O3 phase. These changes influenced the adsorption ability of the Sm-Mn-O catalyst for NH3 or NO\u00a0+\u00a0O2. After calcination at >550\u00a0\u00b0C, the contents of Mn4+ and adsorbed oxygen (OS) on the surface of Sm-Mn-O decreased obviously, resulting in the decrease in its catalytic properties for the NO oxidation and transformation of bridged nitrite to active intermediate of bidentate nitrate. Conversely, its catalytic activity for NH3 oxidation was enhanced after being calcined at high temperature. These adverse factors cause the decrease in the SCR activities of Sm-Mn-O calcined at >550\u00a0\u00b0C.",

Both of the composite catalysts were prepared from CeO2 oxide with different particles sizes [i.e., bulk CeO2 (Ru/b-CeO2) and nanosized CeO2 (Ru/n-CeO2)]. The n-Ru/CeO2 exhibited high catalytic activity for the free-radical driven oxyfunctionalization reaction of the inert CH bond in p-cymene to afford up to 55% conversion within 5\u00a0h at 65% TCHP and 26% PMAP selectivity. The combined ratio of the TCHP/PMAP selectivity was dependent on the reaction time and the amount of p-cymene conversion. An increase in the reaction time resulted in converted large amount of TCHP to PMAP. The better catalytic performance of the Ru/n-CeO2 catalyst compared to Ru/b-CeO2 was partially due to the catalyst redox and oxygen vacancies effect. Both the reduced and oxidized forms of Ru/n-CeO2 were investigated to gain insight into the active form of the catalyst. The reduced Ru/n-CeO2 catalyst exhibited poor performance compared to the high catalytic performance of the oxidized form. This result demonstrated the significant concomitant effect of the balanced Ru4+/Ru3+ and Ce4+/Ce3+ redox combination to facilitate the free-radical driven mechanism via the excitation of O2 to activate the substrate inert CH. The Ru/n-CeO2 catalyst was highly recyclable with consistent activity after its sequential re-use. The catalytic performance of Ru/n-CeO2 was correlated to its structural characteristics based on the results from complimentary techniques, such as powder XRD, Raman spectroscopy, HRTEM, BET SA nitrogen physisorption, FESEM, H2-TPR and EDX. According to the characterization results, the enhanced catalytic performance of the Ru NPs loaded on CeO2 with nanosized particles was due to intrinsic metal-metal oxide interactions, enhanced redox cycles and high oxygen mobility resulting from structural defects of n-CeO2 that form oxygen vacancies compared to dispersed on the bulk CeO2 with large particles. The catalytic activity exhibited by Ru/CeO2 provides encouraging results to add to the class of active and stable catalysts for the activation of typical alkyl aromatic hydrocarbons, such as the p-cymene inert CH bond, for the selective introduction of an oxygen atom.",

Full conversion of p-CBC was obtained with 100% selectivity towards the desired product BPCBS at optimized specific level of process parameters.

Introduction of strontium promoter reduced acidity of the catalysts, leading to a more favorable reaction pathway during the ethanol steam reforming reaction. Promotion with strontium generally had a positive effect on the catalytic activity due to enhanced nickel dispersion and suppressed acidity.

Easy diffusion of reactants into and long diffusion distance for ethylbenzene escaping out of confined space within beta are the main reason for superior activity and poorer ethylbenzene (EB) selectivity. As for H-MCM-49, acid sites located in 10 MR channels contributed little to the formation of EB due to transition state selectivity; Acid sites located in 12 MR cups on the outer surface with little restriction on the diffusion of reactant/product toward/from the active centers were the major active centers for EB formation, which could be detected by 2,4,6-trimethyl-pyridine; There was diffusion limitation on reactant/product in 12 MR supercages through 10 MR windows to influence activity/selectivity. The enhancement in activity and selectivity in liquid-phase alkylation of benzene with ethylene over MWW zeolites should be mainly focused on transforming confined 12 MR supercages into 12 MR cups with improved openness.",

The significantly enhanced performance of W18O49/g-C3N4 composites was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the interface of W18O49 nanowires and g-C3N4 sheets, involving stronger light absorption in the visible range, faster transfer and more efficient separation of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs.

The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) and Fourier transformation infra-red (FTIR). DRS results showed red shifts in band gap energies of the supported MnO-Ag2O semiconductors with respect to the supported monocomponent one (MnO or Ag2O). Also, in the coupled semiconductors Ag2O-conduction band (CB) potential (E\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.3\u00a0V) is enough negative to immigrate the photogenerated electrons from this level to MnO-CB level (E\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a00.1\u00a0V). This significantly prevent from electron/hole recombination which caused to increase the photocatalytic activity. Due to more negative potential of Ag2O-CB level than oxygen potential reduction, the photogenerated electrons in Ag2O-CB can change oxygen molecules to superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide. The produced H2O2 molecules can break to hydroxyl radicals during the irradiation process. In contrast, valence band (VB) potential of MnO (E\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a02.4\u00a0V) is sufficient for oxidation of water molecules or OH anions to hydroxyl radicals. Adding sodium chloride and potassium bromated to the system caused to decrease the photocatalytic activity because these OH scavengers produce other radicals such as OCl (E\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0V), HOBr (E\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a02.4\u00a0V) and BrO2 (E\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u00a0V) which have less oxidizing power the powerful OH (E\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a02.8\u00a0V).

Unlike the conventional low temperature methanol synthesis, ethanol was adopted as both the solvent and the reaction intermediate in this study. Variation of the aging time of the precipitate led to numerous changes in the surface properties of catalysts, resulting in the different catalytic activity in this reaction. This means that aging time of the precipitate should be precisely controlled for obtaining an efficient Cu/ZnO catalyst by a co-precipitation method. The results of catalytic activities and catalyst characterizations clearly demonstrated that the copper particle size, the morphology, and the strong acidity of the Cu/ZnO catalysts played key roles in this reaction.

The characterization of the nanoparticles confirms that the doping process affects neither particle morphology and crystalline structure, nor the bandgap of the samples.

In this work, we have done a more detailed investigation of the possible transition states, reporting twenty-four structures. More reliable calculations at MP2 level was applied to the most important species and we have observed that dispersion forces play a very important role to selectively stabilize the critical transition state leading to the main enantiomer. The possible partition equilibria of several species have also been considered and a kinetic model was proposed. We have found the formation of a dimer of the cinchoninium ion takes place and this behavior leads to fractional kinetic order in the catalyst concentration.

Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of core (BiVO4)\u2013shell (BiVO4: Er3+, Yb3+) composite UC photocatalyst by in situ process. The novel features of the process are the mild operating conditions by a doping selection of Er3+, Yb3+.

Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), it suggests that the photocatalyst comprised of core (BiVO4)\u2013shell (BiVO4: Er3+, Yb3+). The presence of dopant (Er3+ and Yb3+) in the shell could suppress the radiative recombination process, leading to higher photon efficiency. Furthermore, photoactivities for near infrared (NIR)-light-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting demonstrate that the photocatalytic performance of the Er/Yb co-doped BiVO4 (U08, 3.22\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0cm\u22122, 0.7\u00a0V vs. RHE) is about 7 times that of undoped BiVO4 (U0, 0.48\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0cm\u22122, 0.7\u00a0V vs. RHE).

The obtained materials were characterized by various techniques, such as XRD, N2 physisorption, TEM, FTIR, UV-DRS, XPS, and NH3-TPD. Characterization results revealed that molybdenum species could be finely dispersed in the framework of KIT-5 without disturbing long-range ordering at Si/Mo ratios higher than 15, while collapse of mesoporous structure and presence of bulk MoO3 was observed for Mo-KIT-5-5 sample with a Si/Mo ratio of 5. Mo-contained materials were investigated in catalytic conversion of 1-butene and ethylene to propene. Among all of Mo-KIT-5 materials studied, Mo-KIT-5-40 with Si/Mo ratio of 40 exhibited best catalytic performance caused by the fact that it processed superior textural properties, substantial active Mo species, and appropriate amount of acidic sites. Further decreasing the Si/Mo ratio resulted in declined activity due to the presence of extraframework Mo species. It was found that doped Mo-KIT-5-40 showed better catalytic activity than control supported Mo/KIT-5-40 and Mo/SiO2-40 catalysts with same Mo loading due to the highly dispersed active Mo species on the mesoporous framework. Moreover, Mo-KIT-5 was also superior to other Mo containing mesoporous materials, such as Mo-SBA-15 with two-dimensional pores and Mo-KIT-6 with three-dimensional cylindrical pores, implying the advantage of this kind of ordered 3D cage-like mesoporous materials in this reaction.",

Pd-based heterogeneous catalysts are highly regarded for achieving this reaction. However, the knowledge of the Suzuki mechanism with this type of catalysts is relatively limited. In the present paper, the influence of the acidity of heterogeneous catalysts on the Suzuki coupling has been methodically investigated on palladium supported on silica\u2013alumina. A Suzuki coupling model reaction was used to assess if any correlation exists between the performances of the prepared catalysts and their acidity. The results have demonstrated that, the Pd being in an oxidized state, the acid sites at the heterogeneous catalyst surface participate actively to the mechanism of the Suzuki coupling. An optimum of total acidity of the catalysts leading to a peak of performances (conversion and selectivity) was identified. Several assumptions concerning the implication of the catalytic support in the different steps of the Suzuki coupling mechanism are proposed and discussed. Furthermore, the recyclability of the catalyst has been demonstrated, revealing that our catalysts really behave heterogeneously.",

These results suggest that the catalytic performances depend strongly on the zeolite structure and thus, the size of the formed metal oxide particles. The catalytic activity and selectivity are controlled by the porous structure and the chemical state of V and Mo species. The extent of dispersion and reducibility of supported M-Ox (MV or Mo) species are governed by the chemical identity of the support as detected by TPR analysis and optical absorption spectroscopy.

On the basis of characterization data (XRD, Raman spectroscopy, EDX, BET Surface area determinations, H2-TPR, DRIFT and DRS), it was proposed that the interaction of gold with TiO2 caused an enhancement of the partial photo-oxidation activity to acetone due to an increase of the charge separation between the excited electron and the hole of TiO2, whereas the coexistence of gold and both TiO2 and CeO2 oxides favoured the total oxidation of the alcohol to CO2.

The enzyme mimics show stereospecificity and substrate selectivity in the amidolysis of phenylalanine p-nitroanilide. The proper orientation of the reactive functionalities in the super crosslinked macroporous polymer matrix for selective binding of the substrate through H-bonding is responsible for the high imprinting efficiency and substrate specificity of the imprinted polymer catalysts.

The structural anisotropy in which the conducting layer is spatially separated from the charge generation sites may help in suppressing charge recombination and consequently enhance catalytic activity. The band gaps of the series obtained from absorption spectra are above 3.6\u00a0eV and hence they are not active under visible light irradiation. H2 evolution is considerably enhanced under UV light on employing NiO as cocatalyst due to facile electron transfer from InGaO3(ZnO)m to NiO. However, when CuO is used as cocatalyst, visible light activity could be brought out. Due to the very low band gap of CuO, it can act as a sensitizer absorbing in visible light. The band positions become conducive for H2 evolution due to band alignments consequent to electron accumulation in CuO conduction band.",

XRD and TEM results confirmed formation of nanocrystalline solid solutions with the incorporation of Mn into ceria lattice. ICP-OES analysis confirmed actual amount of MnOx loadings in the respective catalysts. The BET surface area of CeO2 significantly enhanced after the incorporation of MnOx dopant. Raman results disclosed that the incorporation of MnOx into ceria lattice greatly enhances the oxygen vacancies, which are responsible for the improved catalytic activity. XPS analysis revealed that Ce and Mn exist in +3, +4 and +2, +3, +4 oxidation states, respectively, on the surface of the samples. H2-TPR results showed pronounced enhancement in the reduction of CeO2 by MnOx doping.

The catalytic ability of CeO2 depended on the specific surface area, and the addition of gold always increased activity. Similarly, addition of MOx to CeO2 (M:Ce\u00a0=\u00a01:10) increased catalytic activity, and there was a synergic interaction between the MOx and CeO2 phases. For Au/MOx/CeO2 catalysts the presence of gold nanoparticles did not affect the initial reaction temperature or that for 100% conversion, or the apparent activation energy compared to MOx/CeO2 catalysts. The rate determining step in these reactions is suggested to be CH bond activation. This was supported by TG/DTA studies under 10% H2 in N2 that showed there was no correlation between the catalysis results and the temperature of initial mass loss of lattice oxygen. Gold nanoparticles (5\u00a0wt%) were introduced by adsorption and subsequent thermolysis of preformed n-hexanethiolate-stabilized gold nanoparticles. STEM and XRD studies showed that the average size of the gold nanoparticles depended on the surface area. Introduction of gold nanoparticles by this method introduces a small amount of sulfur as adsorbed sulfate, but this did not have any major poisoning effect on isobutane oxidation. Gold 4f7/2 XPS studies on Au/MOx/CeO2 showed that the only common gold species was Au(0), suggesting that higher oxidation states were not important in the oxidation, while Ce 3d5/2 studies established the presence of Ce(III) in addition to Ce(IV), indicating their involvement in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, including possible participation in reoxidation of reduced MOx.",

A kinetic study was performed in a packed-bed tubular reactor under different conditions. The catalytic combustion kinetics were modeled using a Power-Law model and the Mars\u2013Van Krevelen model. The results showed that the Mars\u2013Van Krevelen kinetic model provided a significantly better fit to explain the catalytic combustion kinetics of benzene over the NiMnO3/CeO2/Cordierite catalyst. The results showed that the reduction reaction occurred more easily than did the oxidation reaction on the surface of the catalyst. Moreover, the values of the pre-exponential factor for the reduction steps (7.84\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01011\u00a0s\u22121) is higher than those of the oxidation steps (1.04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0s\u22121), indicating that the more is the effective collision times between the activated molecules, and the easier for chemical reaction to occur, and the degree and speed are more intense and rapid. Therefore, it can be concluded that the catalyzed surface oxidation reaction is the control step of catalytic benzene combustion. Based on this analysis of the experimental results and the assumptions of the Mars\u2013Van Krevelen model, it was determined that the catalytic combustion of benzene over the NiMnO3/CeO2/Cordierite catalyst obeys the Mars\u2013Van Krevelen mechanism.

The porous 2-vinyl-functional diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine (2V-P,N) polymer (POL-2V-P,N) was successfully synthesized under solvothermal conditions. The POL-2V-P,N polymer was characterized by nitrogen physisorption, thermogravimetry (TG), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The heterogenized homogeneous Pd/POL-2V-P,N catalyst was synthesized by immobilizing Pd(OAc)2 on the POL-2V-P,N, which was used as not only support but also as ligands. The catalyst was investigated by means of 31P NMR, X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and FT-IR and tested for the methoxycarbonylation of acetylene. According to the results of 31P NMR, XPS and EXAFS, there existed coordination bonds between palladium and the exposed phosphorous and nitrogen atoms of the porous POL-2V-P,N support. The XPS and FT-IR results showed that Pd0 species were present on the Pd/POL-2V-P,N catalyst. The heterogenized Pd/POL-2V-P,N palladium complex catalyst with high surface area and large pore volume displayed excellent activity for the methoxycarbonylation of acetylene as compared with the corresponding homogeneous palladium diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine complex (Pd-P,N) under the same conditions. The used Pd/POL-2V-P,N catalyst also exhibited excellent activity under the same conditions. In addition, the hot filtration tests indicated that the reaction occurred in a heterogeneous way.",

NiO nanoparticles had lateral sizes less than \u223c2\u00a0nm up to 600\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas annealing at a higher temperature (750\u00a0\u00b0C) resulted in a significant agglomeration of NiO, with the formation of 30\u00a0nm-sized particles. Annealing at a higher temperature resulted in a reduction in carbon impurities in the annealing temperature range of 300\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C. Among the four samples annealed at different temperatures, the 450\u00a0\u00b0C-annealed sample showed the highest CO oxidation activity at room temperature. CO oxidation reactivity of this sample initially decreased with reaction time; however, the deactivation became less pronounced over time, with maintenance of 60% of the initial activity of this catalyst after 680\u00a0min. Furthermore, 450\u00a0\u00b0C-annealing of used catalyst resulted in full recovery of the initial CO oxidation reactivity.

The shape and particle sizes of FeMCF changed significantly with an increase in the Fe concentration (4\u201312\u00a0wt.%) accompanied with the formation of Fe particles agglomerated on the external surface of the catalysts. Interestingly, the sponge-like foam structure coupled with large pores of MCF could be maintained for all concentrations of Fe added. FT-IR and UV\u2013vis DRS analyses revealed that Fe was successfully incorporated mostly within the mesostructure of MCF rather than being distributed on the external surface at Fe loadings of 4\u201310\u00a0wt.%. However, formation of minor amount of iron oxides distributed on the external surface of FeMCF12 was detected by the appearance of broad bands in the range of 300\u2013400\u00a0nm. An increase in the Fe content (4\u201312\u00a0wt.%) gave a slight decrease in the surface area (708\u2013606\u00a0m2/g) and pore properties of the FeMCF. The increase in the Fe concentration from 4 to 12\u00a0wt.% progressively increased the degradation from 63 to 100%. The high decolourisation and degradation efficiencies of FeMCF10 could be explained in terms of combined factors such as high mesopore surface area (552\u00a0m2/g), large cell size (8\u00a0nm) and the presence of isolated Fe species leading to high accessibility of active sites without mass transfer limitations. FeMCF10 exhibited long term stability and good structural stability after it was used for five consecutive degradation cycles.",

In this study, rather than using TiO2 powder, a nanoscale TiO2 hydrosol was used because it is easily measured using spectrometric methods. The results indicated that the addition of H2O2 to the TiO2 hydrosol greatly enhanced the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. Although the presence of O2 slightly affected the photocatalytic activity, the presence of dissolved H2O2 markedly enhanced the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the consumption of dissolved H2O2 may account for the decrease in MB degradation after repeated cycles.

Moreover, the aggregated WO3 was observed over the Cat-B and Cat-C, the BET surface areas and total pore volume of the two samples significantly decreased compared with Cat-A. Besides, the Br\u00f6nsted (B) acid sites only appeared on the Cat-A catalyst and the intensity of Lewis acid was visibly stronger than that of Cat-B and Cat-C. Importantly, the Cat-A possessed its higher concentration of Ce3+ and surface chemisorbed oxygen O\u03b1. As a result, the structure geometry and surface acidity were different on the (1\u00a01\u00a01) and (2 0\u00a00) surfaces of CeO2, which were dependence on the different precipitants.",

     "abstract": "A phosphomolybdic acid (PMA)-based heterogeneous catalyst, denoted as PMA/KAP, was prepared by immobilizing PMA onto a knitting aryl network polymer (KAP) based on triphenylphosphine (PPh3). The catalytic property of PMA/KAP was investigated for the selective oxidation of olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as oxidant. When using ethyl acetate (EAC) as reaction medium, PMA/KAP performs higher activity and selectivity to epoxide for a variety of olefins, and it can be reused for several times without obvious loss of activity. When the reaction was carried out in acetonitrile (AN) medium, deactivation of PMA/KAP catalyst can be observed immediately. A variety of characterization results suggest that the degradation of PMA unit to (PO4[MoO(O2)2]4)3\u2212 occurs easily when the PMA/KAP catalyst is operated in H2O2/AN system, while such degradation behavior could be significantly inhibited when the catalyst is used in the system of H2O2/EAC. We proposed that the neighbouring P-containing ligands dispersed in the framework of KAP can produce a steric pocket with low electron density, which can promote the formation of multi-weak coordination interaction between PMA unit and several P ligands. Such multi-weak interaction can inhibit the degradation of PMA to (PO4[MoO(O2)2]4)3\u2212, thus avoiding the leaching of active species from the KAP support, and resulting in the formation of relatively stable heterogeneous PMA supported catalyst for olefin epoxidation with H2O2 in the media of EAC.",

Effects of the Zn content, concentration of alkaline treatment (NaOH) after hydrogen reduction, and hydrogen reduction temperature on the properties of Ru\u2013Zn/ZrO2 catalysts with a fix Ru loading of 10.0 wt% are studied.

Each mole of 1,3-dimethoxypropane produced approximately 2 moles of methoxy groups, which are probably bound to magnesium chloride as methoxymagnesium chloride. A Grignard reagent, BuMgCl formed in the Grignard\u2013Wurtz reaction most likely causes the cleavage of the ether bonds in 1,3-dimethoxypropane and there seem to be at least two parallel reaction paths taking place and producing at least two different by-products. The first step in the cleavage of 1,3-dimethoxypropane is a Grignard reagent (BuMgCl) induced elimination of OCH3, which gives 3-methoxy-1-propene. This intermediate product reacts further in a substitution reaction caused by the Grignard reagent producing 1-heptene as the by-product. The cleavage of the ether bond in 3-methoxy-1-propene and formation of OCH3 can also occur through another reaction path, which produces propene as the by-product.",

The catalysts were characterized using various techniques (XRD, N2 adsoption\u2013desorption isotherms, TPR, DRS and XPS) and evaluated at various temperatures and atmospheric pressure in a fixed bed differential reactor, using the HDS of thiophene as a probe reaction.The calcination of the carrier before its usage has been optimized. The adjustment of the impregnation parameters allowed regulating the Mo loading in the monolayer region and thus optimizing the catalytic performance. A linear decrease of the intrinsic activity with the Mo surface density and a concomitant volcano trend for the specific activity have been found.Monomer, monopodal Mo species are deposited on the anatase surface in the pH range 7.0\u20134.5 and polymer Mo species at pH 2. The former are transformed into tripodal ones after calcination. Thus, the monolayer capacity of the anatase surface is decreased leading to a partial association of these species into oligomer ones where the mean number of TiOMo bridges per Mo atom is lower than three. The extent of this transformation increased with the Mo surface density. The DRS, XPS and TPR results suggested that electron transfer takes place through the TiOMo bridges from the anatase surface oxygen to the Mo4d orbitals.The monomer tripodal Mo species are transformed into relatively small Mo sulphided edge clusters in tilted or perpendicular configuration bonded on the anatase surface by TiOMo and/or TiSMo bridges. The aforementioned transfer in the electronic density from the surface oxygens, and likewise from the surface sulfur, to Mo4d orbitals weakens the MoS bonds of the clusters and stabilizes S-deficient structures creating coordinative unsaturated active sites. This explains the very high intrinsic activity of these small Mo sulphided clusters.The oligomer Mo species, on the other hand, are transformed into relatively larger Mo S-deficient sulphided clusters, also with tilted or perpendicular configuration with respect to the anatase surface. The number the MoOTi and MoSTi bridges per Mo atom is smaller than that in the small Mo sulphided clusters, resulting to less coordinative unsaturated active sites per Mo atom. The above explained the aforementioned trends for the intrinsic and specific activities.",

This work reports development of Au nanocatalysts dispersed on nanosized CeO2 and CeO2-ZrO2 supports for solvent- and base-free oxidative coupling of benzylamines into N-benzylbenzaldimines using O2 as a green oxidant. The physicochemical characterization of nanocatalysts has been undertaken using HRTEM, UV\u2013vis DRS, XRD, Raman, BET, TG-DTA, AAS, and XPS techniques. HRTEM images reveal the formation of nanosized CeO2 and CeO2-ZrO2 supports with an average diameter of \u223c10 and 7\u00a0nm, respectively.

The Au/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited a higher efficiency in benzylamine conversion (\u223c95%) followed by Au/CeO2 (\u223c78%), CeO2-ZrO2 (\u223c51%), and CeO2 (\u223c39%).

     "abstract": "Two new manganese(III) complexes, [pyH][Mn(Br4Cat)2(py)] (1) and [Mn(Br4Cat)(Br3pyCat)(py)2] (2), where py is pyridine, Br4CatH2 is tetrabromocatechol and Br3pyCatH2 is 3,5,6-tribromo-4-pyridiniumcatechol, derived from redox \u2018noninnocent\u2019 bromo-substituted catecholate ligands are reported. Both complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques in addition to the single crystal X-ray crystallography, and the electrochemical behavior of these complexes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Variable temperature UV\u2013vis spectral studies for complex 1 reveal an unprecedented observation in which a dramatic increase of the ligand-to-metal charge transfer band at 592\u00a0nm associated with concomitant change in color of the solution from olive-green to dark-green is noticed with increase in temperature. This unprecedented spectral feature is consistent with the formation of a new species 2 in which valence tautomerism induced aromatic nucleophilic substitution of a tetrabromocatecholate ligand by pyridine is observed. DFT calculations have been used to rationalize this unexpected result. To the best of our knowledge, the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrabromosemiquinone by pyridine to generate this pyridinium-containing catecholate ligand is the first example of valence tautomerism induced nucleophilic ipso substitution by a nitrogen containing ligand. Although the electrochemical behavior of both complexes is similar, the probable role of a positive charge on the ligand backbone has been discussed in order to justify the significantly higher catalytic activity of complex 2 over complex 1.",

     "abstract": "Iron oxide incorporated titania nanoparticles (FIT) with various atomic ratios of Fe/Ti, i.e. 3.53% (FIT-1), 8.3% (FIT-2), and 20.79% (FIT-3), are prepared to monitor the selectivity of photo-degradation for anthranilic acid (AA) in molecular level. In the FIT-1 route, the products obtained from the photo-degradation of AA are aniline, 4-aminophenol, and benzene. Since the surface of iron oxide domain in FIT-1 is fully reduced to FeO. The FeO, by trapping the photo-generated (e\u2212), acts as a Lewis base to facilitate the de-carboxylation reaction for AA to create aniline. It is noteworthy that the highly alkaline surface of FIT-1 executes the hydroxylation addition for AA to produce 4-aminophenol. In FIT-2, and FIT-3 routes, the surface of incorporated iron oxide is only partially reduced to FeO. After the photo-degradation of AA, the collected products are 2-aminobenzaldehyde, and benzene. In this route, the low spin (LS) Fe3+ ion in the Fe2O3 region adopts the photo-generated (e\u2212). The LS Fe3+ is reduced to stable LS Fe2+, i.e. FeO. At this stage, the Fe2O3 domain acts as a Lewis acid to push forward the carbonyl reduction of AA to obtain 2-aminobenzaldehyde. In addition, the de-amination is contributed by the nucleorphilic attack of water molecule to the carbon atom of aromatic ring bonded to NH2 group. After the de-amination reaction, the intermediate product is phenol. The following de-hydroxyl reaction by FeO domain proceeds immediately. The final product is benzene that is observed in all FIT involved catalytic routes.",

     "abstract": "The photocatalytic applications of the S-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) are of great importance due to photon-to-carrier conversion ability of S-doping in the energy region below the band gap of pure TiO2. Therefore, 1D (one dimensional) S-doped TiO2 anatase nanorods were synthesized first time by facile, low temperature and template free oxidant peroxide method (OPM). The addition of thiourea as sulfur precursor favored the formation of better crystalline anatase TiO2 and S atoms favorably crystalized the anatase structure. It was found that substitution of Ti4+ by S6+ in the lattice of S doped TiO2 nanorods increased the number of adsorbed active groups (hydroxyl radical) at the surface of catalyst and also gave rise to the visible-light response. The formation of TiOS bond favors the partial transfer of electrons from S to O atoms. It helps the electron-deficient S atoms to hold/capture electrons and thus reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs. The preferred anatase {1\u00a00\u00a01} facets could also act as beneficiary reservoirs to decrease the recombination probability of electron\u2013hole pairs. Methylene blue (MB) was used as target organic molecule for evolution of photocatalytic activity by photocatalytic oxidation reaction under visible-light. The mineralization products of MB were detected using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and GC/MS spectroscopy that gave the pattern of possible degraded fragments from the mineralization of MB. The role of active species in the degradation process was identified with the help of Mott\u2013Schottky measurement, addition of different scavengers and the band structure obtained from the UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectrum. It was found that holes and hydroxyl radicals played major role in the photo-degradation of MB. The fundamental mechanism for enhanced photocatalytic performance of S doped TiO2 nanorods was discussed in detail and attributed to the S doping and morphology engineering that may improve the electron\u2013hole pair separation efficiency for enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible-light irradiation. This work may provide an insight into the synthesis of S doped TiO2 photocatalysts that showed good stability after four cycles and have great potential for environmental purification of organic pollutants.",

The isopropylation of BP over both of Co(5)APO-5 and Ni(5)APO-5 at 250\u00a0\u00b0C gave the high selectivities for 4,4\u2032-DIPB: 65\u201375%. 4-IPBP is almost exclusive precursor of 4,4\u2032- and 3,4\u2032-DIPB. 3-IPBP was not significantly concerned even though 3-IPBP was predominant among IPBP isomers at the late stages: the MAPO-5 channels allow preferential access of 4-IPBP, and prevent the access of 3-IPBP due to reactant selectivity mechanism. The selective formation of 4,4\u2032-DIPB occurred by preferential exclusion of bulkier 3,4\u2032-DIPB and other isomers through the steric interaction of transition states with the channels by the restricted transition state selectivity mechanism. MAPO-5 (M: Co and Ni) has the same level of the selectivities for 4,4\u2032-DIPB to SSZ-24 and other MAPO-5 (M: Si, Mg, and Zn), and these selectivities were originated by the AFI channels.

     "abstract": "We proposed to combine a polarized mineral tourmaline and TiO2 nanosemiconductor to form a hybrid photocatalyst, to simultaneously optimize the photocatalytic efficiency and macroscopic aggregation of nano-TiO2. Photoactivity assessment toward bisphenol A (BPA) degradation indicated the optimal T(20%)-TiO2 catalyst exhibited higher performance than the bare TiO2 or the mechanical mixtures. In view of the reactive species scavenging results and intermediate identification, a hydroxyl radical-initiated oxidation as the dominating BPA decomposition pathway was proposed. The results of photoluminescence spectra and photocurrent measurements along with electrochemical impedance spectra and Mott\u2013Schottky analyses led us to a better understanding of the photocatalytic process involving the facilitated charge transfer and higher carrier density induced owing to tourmaline incorporation. The synergistic effects in tourmaline-involved photocatalysis would be attributed to the fact that the internal dipolar field, originating from tourmaline spontaneous polarization, resulted in spatially varied energy levels of the bands and changed band bending of TiO2 semiconductor, which lowered the potential barrier for photoelectrons or holes to readily migrate to the surface and retarded electron\u2013hole recombination. The concept of engineering internal field in heterogeneous photocatalysis using a polarized mineral of low cost will shed new light on applied photochemistry and development of nanotechnology enabled approaches for water treatment.",

The precatalyst system comprising Ru(acac)3 and 3 equivalent OAm shows the high catalytic activity in hydrogen generation from dimethylamine borane solution. Monitoring the hydrogen evolution shows the presence of an induction period during which the homogeneous catalyst is formed, and then the hydrogen evolution continues almost linearly until the complete dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane. UV\u2013vis spectroscopic observation implies on the formation of a ruthenium(II) species. Using UV\u2013vis, FTIR, Mass, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies we could identify the presence of trans-[Ru(acac)2(OAm)2] in the solid residue obtained after the catalytic reaction. This complex might be a stable form of the active catalyst as it shows similar catalytic activity in dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane as before. The precatalyst system comprising Ru(acac)3 and 3 equivalent OAm provides 15,000 turnovers over 8 days with a constant turnover frequency of TOF\u00a0=\u00a077.8\u00a0h\u22121 in hydrogen generation from the dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane in toluene solution at 60.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u00b0C.

The catalytic reaction was found to be first-order with respect to each of both Ru(acac)3 and dimethylamine borane concentrations.

The \u03b2-Mo2C/CNTs favors the pathway of hydrogenation\u2013dehydration\u2013hydrogenation to produce n-octadecane with an optimal yield of 91.24% at a lower temperature of 180\u00a0\u00b0C during hydrotreating process of stearic acid. The recycle tests demonstrate that the \u03b2-Mo2C/CNTs exhibits excellent stability, and can be reused for seven times consecutively without reduction of catalytic stability. Based on the determined products, a brief reaction pathway is proposed. Therefore, a novel approach to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons via catalytic hydrotreatment of microalgae-based bio-oils over \u03b2-Mo2C/CNTs is introduced, which provides a basic research as well as technical parameters for its further industrialization.",

In comparison with the two homoleptic counterparts (Qa3FeIII and Qb3FeIII), the proposed heteroleptic Q3FeIII complexes possessed similar coordination features to the Qb3FeIII one but showed similar catalysis performances to the Qa3FeIII one in the oxygenation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in acetonitrile. More importantly, both heteroleptic Q3FeIII complexes showed a better accelerating effect on this reaction and provided a slightly higher conversion than the Qa3FeIII and especially Qb3FeIII ones. Furthermore, this predominance in catalytic activity was more strikingly apparent upon both-catalyzed oxygenations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene or thioanisole by H2O2. This should be due to a structurally distorted effect of the heteroleptic Q3FeIII complexes that is induced by the different in ligand environment, as supported by DFT B3LYP/6-311G (d) calculation. Based the present reaction and UV\u2013vis spectral characterization results, a free radical mechanism for the present catalysis system was proposed.",

Herein the novel synthesis strategy via in situ chemical transformation was successfully utilized to prepare BiVO4/BiOCl {001} heterojunctions. The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that BiVO4/BiOCl photocatalyst was made of BiOCl sheets and BiVO4 nanoparticles. The exact band alignment was experimentally demonstrated in BiVO4/BiOCl through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the valence band difference is 0.58\u00a0eV which is a driving force valence of band holes from BiVO4 to BiOCl by the valence band offset. While the reductive electrons were driven by conduction band difference (1.27\u00a0eV) along the opposite direction compared to the oxidative holes.

     "abstract": "In this study, three trivalent Mn (oxyhydr)oxides, bixbyite (\u03b1-Mn2O3), hausmannite (Mn3O4) and manganite (\u03b3-MnOOH) were synthesized and used as persulfate (PS) activators in phenol oxidation. Of these three Mn (oxyhydr)oxides, only \u03b3-MnOOH shows a good catalytic activity in PS activation with more than 80% phenol oxidized within 360\u00a0min in the full pH range. With increasing concentrations of PS and \u03b3-MnOOH, phenol removal efficiency increased. TOC results also suggest that phenol oxidation at pH 11 is more complete than those at pH 7 and 3. We further confirm that mechanism involved in phenol oxidation is pH dependent in \u03b3-MnOOH/PS system. Although SO4\u2212 and OH were both found under acidic and alkaline conditions, they did not contribute equally under different pHs. At pH 11, SO4\u2212 and OH generated from PS activation efficiently oxidize phenol. At pH 3, the strong oxidation activity of \u03b3-MnOOH and an oxidative intermediate formed between S2O82\u2212 and \u03b3-MnOOH primarily contribute to phenol oxidation. At pH 7, an oxidative intermediate formed between \u03b3-MnOOH and S2O82\u2212 is the predominant oxidative species in phenol oxidation.",

Derivatization of the bpy ligand was carried out at the 4,4\u2032- and 5,5\u2032-positions with electron-withdrawing amide groups. The derivatized ligands were grafted on mesoporous silica via a dipodal silane coupling agent and were further coordinated with Re(I). The synthesized hybrid photocatalysts were studied using spectroscopic techniques, including UV\u2013visible, in situ infrared and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and tested in photochemical CO2 reduction. An interesting light-induced color change was observed for the hybrid photocatalyst involving derivatization of the bpy ligand at the 5,5\u2032-positions. Combined UV\u2013visible and EPR studies indicated that in the reduced form of this hybrid photocatalyst electron density was more localized on the bpy ligand than on the Re(I) center. Further studies with in situ infrared spectroscopy demonstrated possible formation of a carbonate-bridged binuclear Re(I) species on this hybrid photocatalyst. Our results are particularly relevant to developing new molecular and hybrid photocatalytic systems which involve extensive derivatization of coordinating ligands with functional groups for improved solar energy conversion.",

Phenol is obtained as a main product in a yield of 2.5%, however, the selectivity of phenol is low (44.0%) due to the formation of by-products such as hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, CO, and CO2. The use of Cu/HZSM-5 leads to a significantly higher selectivity of phenol (94.0%) under an O2 partial pressure that is lower than the atmospheric O2 partial pressure. It is found that excess O2 in the gas-phase causes the formation of by-products, whereas a decrease of O2 partial pressure prevents the by-products from forming. Moreover, the addition of Ti to Cu/HZSM-5 leads to improved phenol formation activity. Good yield (4.3%) and selectivity (88.0%) of phenol are achieved over Cu/Ti/HZSM-5 under a low O2 partial pressure. The addition of Ti is found to accelerate the formation of Cu+ as an active site. It is therefore speculated that phenol can be formed selectively over Cu/Ti/HZSM-5 under lower O2 partial pressure owing to the increase of Cu+ sites by Ti addition and the prevention of by-product formation by the decreased O2 partial pressure.",

The conversion of ethanol and the product distribution were analysed by gas chromatography. The highest ethanol conversion was measured on Rh/CeO2 catalyst. The results showed that the nature of the oxide support affected the reaction mechanism. On supported Rh catalysts ethanol adsorption gives rise to ethoxide species, which can be decomposed to CO2, CO and CH4 and dehydrogenated, forming acetaldehyde. The latter species are oxidized to acetate or dehydrogenated to acetyl species on Rh/Al2O3 and on Rh/CeO2. On Rh/TiO2 the acetaldehyde can also be oxidized in a parallel process to HCOOH/HCOO(a) which forms CO2 and water. Furthermore, the acetate species previously formed can be decomposed to CH4, CO and/or oxidized to CO2 via carbonate species at higher temperature depending on the oxide support. On silica support acetaldehyde was the dominant intermediate and it desorbed or directly decomposed with or without oxygen to CO2 and methane.

The existing experimental results proved that there was a synergistic effect between the photocatalytic degradation of the given organic dyes (MO and Rh B) and reduction of Cr(VI).

The XRD results of unsupported MoPO show the formation of (MoO2)2P2O7 phase and this phase is present in a well dispersed state on the SBA-15. Raman spectra reveal the presence of MoPO species in the form of (MoO2)2P2O7 phase in the samples above 40\u00a0wt% MoPO/SBA-15. The presence of both isolated tetrahedrally and isolated octahedrally coordinated Mo centers in the unsupported and supported MoPO are confirmed by the UVDRS findings. Ammonia TPD analysis suggests that the total acidity increased with MoPO loading and acidity of the catalysts was proved to be detrimental to assess the catalytic performance. The conversion and selectivity during the acetalization depends strongly on the reaction time, catalyst loading and glycerol to acetone molar ratio. Acetalization of glycerol suggests that 40\u00a0wt% MoPO/SBA-15 sample exhibited better catalytic properties than other catalysts investigated. The catalytic properties are well correlated with the acidic functionalities of the catalysts.",

Structural species were defined and a kinetic profile of the entire reaction is depicted. The determined mechanism showed an associative reaction between the [RuCl2(PPh3)2(piperidine)] complex initiator and ethyl diazoacetate as the first step, resulting in a metal-carbene species. This species loses one triphenylphosphine molecule (PPh3) and the global rate-determining step is associated with a removal of the second PPh3 molecule due to an electronic trans-synergism between piperidine and this PPh3 molecule. Entropic factors are crucial to the spontaneity observed for the dissociation of both PPh3 ligands. The step following the rate-determining one is associated with the binding of a norbornene molecule and a similar trans-synergism between this monomer and piperidine activates the catalysis. This electronic effect maintains the system in a very important conformation along the catalytic chain.",

     "abstract": "We investigate the metal catalyzed intramolecular 1,2 carbon shift reaction, usually associated with the epimerization of sugars, using the density functional theory. Metals like molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W) and vanadium (V), in their oxoanion complex forms (molybdate, tungstate, vanadate) are investigated. The experimentally observed difference in the activity of these metal complexes, in catalyzing 1,2 carbon shift in glucose, at different pH is explained. Formation of larger (polynuclear) metal oxoanions (\u201cmetalates\u201d) at higher pH reduces the structural flexibility of the metal complex. Thus, upon binding with glucose, their ability to rearrange the carbon backbone in sugar molecules decreases, resulting in lower activity towards 1,2 carbon shift at higher pH. For example, the activation barrier for 1,2 carbon shift catalyzed by \u201cactive\u201d di-nuclear molybdate (exists at pH 2.5\u20133.5) is 21.1\u00a0kcal/mol; whereas it is 26.8\u00a0kcal/mol for the tetra-nuclear molybdate (exists at pH 4\u20135.5). Bonding interaction analysis has been carried out to quantify the flexibility/rigidity of the metal oxoanion complexes. Comparison of catalytic activities of Mo, W and V (as dimetalate) showed that vanadate is more active than the popular molybdate complex and W is the least active of them all. The trend in the catalytic activities of these metals is explained on the basis of the participation of higher orbitals in the complexation of metal oxoanions with glucose. Additionally, the flexibility/rigidity of the metal complex is also shown to be a descriptor of its catalytic activity for the 1,2 carbon shift reaction.",

The structural characterization results reveal that with small doping amount (\u22646\u00a0wt%), Ba can preferentially combine with Al2O3 and acts as a stabilizer, which could facilitate the formation of more homogeneous CZ solid solutions. When the content of BaO increases to 8\u00a0wt%, besides the portion combined with Al2O3, the remnant Ba would enter into the lattice of CeO2\u2013ZrO2 to form a ternary CeO2\u2013ZrO2\u2013BaO solid solution, thus further improved oxygen mobility is obtained.

The XPS results demonstrate that with optimal doping content of BaO (8\u00a0wt%), the supported catalyst Pd/CZAB8 possesses highest surface Pd and Ce3+ concentrations, which consequently leads to improved reducibility and catalytic performance. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between CeO2\u2013ZrO2\u2013BaO and BaO\u2013Al2O3 helps improve the thermal stability of Pd/CZAB8.

     "abstract": "A kinetic study was conducted using five metallo-tetraphenylporphyrins (MTPPs) as catalysts for the aerobic oxidation reaction of \u03b2-isophorone (\u03b2-IP) to ketoisophorone (KIP). The oxidation reaction catalyzed by MTPPs (M\u00a0=\u00a0Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Cu) was observed over a seven hour period under a range of experimental conditions. Changes in the specificity of conversion of reactant to the product, KIP, and the main side-product, \u03b1-isophorone (\u03b1-IP), were observed at temperatures ranging from 60\u00a0\u00b0C to 75\u00a0\u00b0C, in solvents with varying compositions of pyridine and \u03b2-IP, with different MTPP catalysts, oxygen gas flow rates, and solution agitation frequencies. Control experiments show that MTPP catalysts modestly increase the rate of KIP formation, but significantly improve specificity through the apparent suppression of \u03b1-IP formation. Analysis revealed that MnTPP (CH3COO\u2212) produced the highest product specificity ratio [KIP]/[\u03b1-IP]. Given that all of the metals were in the 3+ oxidation state in this study and there was no observed binding by O2 to any of the MTPP catalysts, the catalytic mechanism is suggested to involve the binding of \u03b2-IP to the MTPP metal center. Binding of \u03b2-IP is most favorable when pyridine is the trans ligand, but \u03b2-IP is also observed to weakly bind when trans to acetate in the MnTPP adduct. This conclusion is supported by electronic absorption spectroscopy, resonance Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The role played by the catalyst appears to be the activation of hydrogen abstraction following the substrate's ligation to the metal, rather than the more traditional role of MTPPs as O2 activation catalysts by ligation of diatomic O2. \u03b2-IP oxidation is an example of a case where the catalyst appears to have a more important role for improving the specificity of the reaction (through decreasing side-product formation) rather than increasing the rate of product formation.",

In this work, for the first time we report a novel biomimetic phthalocyanine catalyst of Fe3O4@Carbon@Tetranitro copper phthalocyanine (Fe3O4@C@TNCuPc) could catalyze the chromogenic identification of phenol and chlorophenol compounds in the presence of 4-aminoantipyrine and BuOOH without light irradiation or heating. Significantly, the Fe3O4@C@TNCuPc catalyst could be magnetically recycled and show high activity after four successive cycles of catalysis. On the basis of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) test and active species trapping experiments, we propose that the oxidation of substrates was mediated by TNPcCuIIIO active species generated from the homolytic cleavage of the OO bond in TNPcCuIIOOBu.",

Commercially available Amberlyst-15 and the small pore sized MCM-41 were used for comparison. The catalysts were prepared by functionalization of the silica supports with propylsulfonic acid (Pr-SO3H) using post-synthesis grafting with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane as a propyl-thiol precursor. All materials remained in a well-ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure after Pr-SO3H functionalization. The performance of the Pr-SO3H-functionalized mesoporous silicas was evaluated in terms of their catalytic activity in the esterification of oleic acid with short (methanol) and long (glycerol) chain alcohols, i.e., to test the effect of the pore size on the substrate conversion and product yield. The synthesized catalysts were highly active and the product composition could be tuned by selective choice of the mesopore size. The Pr-SO3H-functionalized rope-shaped SBA-15 gave the highest catalytic activity (in terms of the highest methyl oleate and triglyceride yields and oleic acid conversion level), which was higher than that obtained with the commercial Amberlyst-15 catalyst.

The anatase and rutile concentrations were systematically varied by heat treating a nearly amorphous nanoparticle titania at temperatures between 105 and 800\u00a0\u00b0C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements confirmed that the anatase concentration increased with heat treatment temperature until rutile began to form at 600\u00a0\u00b0C, and at 800\u00a0\u00b0C rutile TiO2 was the only phase observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the catalysts revealed strong PdO-TiO2 interactions which increased with support treatment temperature. According to XPS, the interactions yielded electron-deficient PdO species (Pd\u03b4+ with \u03b4\u00a0>\u00a02) and Ti3+ species (likely TiO2 with oxygen vacancies) on the surface of the catalysts, as a result of electron transfer from palladium to titania. These PdO-TiO2 interactions increased with increasing anatase phase in the TiO2 support and the turnover number (TON: number of product molecules formed per surface palladium site) followed the same trend. The strongest interactions (the largest amounts of Pd\u03b4+ with \u03b4\u00a0>\u00a02 and Ti3+ species) were observed for the catalysts supported on rutile TiO2, which is also the catalyst with the highest TON, revealing the importance of electron transfer from palladium to titania in this reaction.

The activity improvement of BiOBr0.9I0.1/BiOI could be ascribed to the synergetic effects of ion doping and heterostructure. On the basis of the Mott-Schottky analysis, a new I\u2212 ion doping energy level formed on top of the valence band of BiOBr strengthened the visible light absorption. Moreover, the heterojunction interface of BiOBr0.9I0.1/BiOI efficiently reduced the recombination of electron-hole pairs.

In other words, ammonium phosphates could be utilized as hydrogen storage materials. Stoichiometrically, mono-, di- and tri-ammonium phosphate can lead to evolve 3.875, 7.867 and 11.903 hydrogen equivalent, respectively. Briefly, Ag-, Cd- and Zn-doped TiO2 nanofibers with different doping content (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5\u00a0wt%) have been synthesized by the electrospinning process. Generally, increasing the dopant content leads to enhance the photohydrolysis of all ammonium phosphate formulations and produce more hydrogen. Compared to the other two formulations, Ag-doped TiO2 (1.5\u00a0wt% Ag) nanofibers showed the best photocatalytic activity as the obtained hydrogen was 41, 37 and 35\u00a0ml from 1\u00a0mmol mono-, di- and tri-ammonium phosphate, respectively. Analyzing the obtained gases by GC confirms evolution of pure hydrogen. Moreover, ion chromatography detects nitrate and nitrite ions in the liquid which indicates hydrolysis of the ammonium phosphate. Overall, this study opens promising avenue to develop new TiO2-based photocatalysts to enhance the hydrolysis of ammonium phosphate to produce hydrogen.",

     "abstract": "The pyrovanadates M2V2O7, where MII\u00a0=\u00a0Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn, have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane from 300 to 450\u00a0\u00b0C, both with and without 5\u00a0wt% gold nanoparticles. Reduction of the pyrovanadate compounds was generally observed, yielding products that contained V(IV) and/or V(III), and depended on both M(II) and the presence of gold nanoparticles. The most stable pyrovanadate was Ni2V2O7. Products identified by XRD were M2VO4, MVO3, MV2O4, or V2O3. The conversion of isobutane always increased with temperature, reaching 11% and 16% in the absence and presence of gold nanoparticles, respectively, at 450\u00a0\u00b0C. Selectivities to isobutene were as high as 40\u201350%. Vanadium 2p3/2 XPS studies indicated that all catalysts exhibited surface V(V) and V(IV), while V(III) was present in those catalysts that generated V(III)-containing products. This suggests that catalytic activity depends on the rate of reoxidation of the lower oxidation states to V(V). Gold 4f7/2 XPS studies always indicated the presence of Au(0) and Au(I), and for some catalysts Au(III). The highest yields of isobutene correlate with the lowest Au(I) content. The reduction products Co2VIVO4 and ZnVIII2O4 were compared in their activities with Co2V2O7 and \u03b1-Zn2V2O7. The reduced phase Co2VO4 proved to be a good catalyst, comparable to the best 5\u00a0wt% Au/M2V2O7 compositions.",

Among the prepared catalysts, copper oxide modified ceria system is found to be the most effective for the mineralization of methylene blue. It is concluded that oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ ions in the catalyst have prominent role in deciding the performance of M/CeO2 catalysts in Fenton-like oxidation reactions. Besides this, the decisive role of redox potential of the doped metal ions on the efficiency of nanoceria in Fenton-like oxidation has also been examined for the first time in literature.

The photocatalytic degradation kinetic characteristics were studied by investigation effect of different operational parameters including \u03b1-FeOOH dosage, pH and initial AO7 concentration as the effective operational parameters. Using the non-linear regression, an empirical kinetic model was developed for predicting the photocatalytic degradation efficiency by taking account into the apparent first order kinetic and operational parameters.

Various types of active oxygen species involved into the photocatalytic process have been investigated extensively, including OH and O2\u2212, but still remain obscure and controversial. Herein, the roles of the active oxygen species generated in the liquid-phase photocatalytic degradation of RhB using BiVO4/TiO2 heterostructure under visible light irradiation are discussed in detail. The results revealed that the liquid-phase photocatalytic degradation behavior was greatly affected by the amount of BiVO4. When the loading BiVO4 was less than 9\u00a0wt%, the de-ethylation of RhB on BiVO4/TiO2 was observed. While, the direct oxidative degradation of RhB took place in the BiVO4/TiO2/RhB system loaded with more BiVO4 (>9\u00a0wt%). Particularly, 9% BiVO4/TiO2 enhanced the photosensitized degradation of RhB, and the degradation efficiency was 80% which was 1.14 times than that of pure TiO2. Combined with different surface analysis techniques (EPR, photoluminescence technique, etc.), it was found that O2\u2212 and OH were the key active species when the loading BiVO4 was less than 9\u00a0wt%, while in the 50% BiVO4/TiO2/RhB system, O2\u2212 and holes played much more roles. Our findings provide certain theoretical guidance in understanding the functional mechanism of heterostructured photocatalysts, which can pave the way to further improve the concentration of the active species and design novel efficient photocatalysts.",

     "abstract": "It has been noticed that some chelating agents can enhance heterogeneous Fenton reactions, as well as homogeneous Fenton reactions. However, the mechanism of the enhanced heterogeneous Fenton reactions remains speculative, due to the ambiguous concurrence of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. In the present work, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was introduced to study the role of the chelating agent in the oxidation of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) in nano-Fe3O4/H2O2 system. The addition of EDTA in solution dramatically accelerated DMP removal partly due to the induced homogeneous Fenton reaction by enhanced dissolution of Fe3O4. Meanwhile, the adsorbed EDTA on the catalyst could also enhance DMP removal. Effects of EDTA surface loadings, initial H2O2 concentrations, initial DMP concentrations, and initial pHs on the reaction kinetics in EDTA modified Fe3O4/H2O2 system were investigated, together with the reusability of the EDTA modified Fe3O4. Results showed that the surface complexed EDTA (FeII/III-EDTA) inhibited H2O2 decomposition by competition for surface active sites. However, the generation of OH and HO2/O2\u2212was not suppressed according to the ESR results. The enhanced DMP removal by FeII/III-EDTA was probably due to the efficient use of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A possible EDTA enhanced heterogeneous Fenton mechanism was further proposed.",

The characterization results revealed the formation of hierarchical AgCl/ZnO nanostructures with cauliflower-like morphology from the self assembly of 1D-nanorods. The photocatalytic activity of these hierarchical nanostructures was evaluated by the degradation of malachite green (MG) dye under visible light. As compared to other AgCl/ZnO nanostructures and bare ZnO, cauliflower like AgCl/ZnO hierarchical nanostructures (i.e., 30% AgCl/ZnO) exhibited higher photocatalytic activity upto 85% in 150\u00a0min for the degradation of MG dye under visible light. Furthermore, the efficiency of 30% AgCl/ZnO was also investigated for the degradation of simulated dyebath effluent under solar light. A terephthalic acid-photoluminescence technique was used to detect OH radicals present in the photocatalytic process. LC\u2013MS technique was also employed to identify the major intermediates in the photodegradation process of MG dye and the reaction pathway based on them was proposed.",

The catalysts were further tested for steam reforming of methanol (SRM) to investigate their comparative catalytic performance. Depending on the nature of the metal component, the catalysts exhibited surface area, pore sizes, and TiO2 crystallite sizes in the range of 99\u2013309\u00a0m2/g, 2.63\u20134.69\u00a0nm and 6.8\u201317.2\u00a0nm, respectively. N2-physorption, TGA-DSC and XRD analysis demonstrated that the presence of metal in the TiO2 matrix stabilized the mesoporous structure by hindering the crystal growth during heat treatment and thereby preventing the collapse of porous structure. Furthermore, the characterization of 5\u201320% Zn-TiO2 catalysts indicated that there exist an optimum Zn loading to obtain highest surface area which was found to be 15% in the present study giving a high surface area of \u223c258\u00a0m2/g. This was consistent with the SRM studies where the activity increased up to 15% and then decreased significantly with further increase in Zn loading to 20%. The results of the SRM studies coupled with extensive TPR analysis of different M-TiO2 catalysts suggest that the specific metal-support interactions play a crucial role in controlling its performance on H2 production. The SRM activity order for different metals incorporated in mesoporous TiO2 was observed to be: Pd\u00a0>\u00a0Ni\u00a0>\u00a0Zn\u00a0>\u00a0Co\u00a0>>\u00a0Cu\u00a0>>\u00a0Sn.

However, up to date, few studies have been reported to examine the formation mechanism of DMMn which is essential in understanding the reaction and valuable in designing improved catalysts. In this work, using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experiment studies, we evaluate the formation mechanism of DMMn which is promoted by sulfonic acid-functionalized ionic liquids (SO3H-FILs). Our calculated results indicate TOX and PF should dissociate into formaldehyde monomers firstly and then to react with MeOH or DMM. However, their decomposition process is different where the dissociation of TOX proceeds along a two-step mechanism while it follows a one-step mechanism for PF dissociation. As for the formation of DMMn, the reaction proceeds along a hemiacetal-carbocation pathway when MeOH is selected as the capping group provider, while the reaction follows a carbocation pathway when DMM is chosen. The origination for the product distribution pattern has also been discussed in detail. The cations and anions of ionic liquids are found synergistically promote the condensation reaction by proton transfer and simultaneously stabilizing the formed intermediated and transition states. Moreover, all the processes related to the decomposition of TOX and PF and the condensation reaction are reversible.",

Bimetallic Co\u2013Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method. Total amount of supported metal was fixed at 20\u00a0wt%. Influence of the Co/Ni ratio, impregnation sequences and solutions on the structure and activity of Co\u2013Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was systematically studied. Low Ni-loading slightly increased CO conversion rate at nearly constant C5+ selectivity, but excess Ni-loading largely decreased CO conversion rate and C5+ selectivity. The catalytic activity did not depend on impregnation sequence, when Ni-loading amount was low. However, when Co was substituted with large amount of Ni, catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation method (Ni first and then Co) showed higher activity than those prepared by co-impregnation method and reverse sequential impregnation method (Co first and then Ni). These results indicate that catalysts with a Co-rich surface would be better than those with a Ni-rich surface. Impregnation solution also influenced the catalytic activity.

The pure single-crystal \u03b1-MnO2 nanorods prepared at 150\u00a0\u00b0C showed the highest SMX degradation efficiency. We concluded that the crystallographic structure and the surface species of MnO2 were more important than BET surface area and crystallinity in influencing the activity in SMX oxidative degradation. The high degradation efficiency of \u03b1-MnO2 nanorods resulted from a (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02) tunnel structure, rich surface adsorbed oxygen and high oxygen mobility. The degradation efficiency of \u03b1-MnO2 nanorods was also greatly influenced by the initial SMX concentration, MnO2 dosage and pH value. The particular reaction orders with respect to these three factors were 0.70, 0.54 and \u22120.15, respectively. Under lower pH conditions (e.g., pH\u00a0<\u00a02.4), a rapid oxidative degradation of SMX by \u03b1-MnO2 was achieved as well as generation of intermediate products and Mn2+. Moreover, \u03b1-MnO2 exhibited high stability in recycling tests, which demonstrated itself to be a good oxidant for oxidative degradation of SMX. These results may be useful in understanding the interaction of SMX and MnO2 in soil and water environments.",

It has already been reported that the limonite achieves the almost complete decomposition of NH3 in inert He at 500\u00a0\u00b0C and shows very stable performance in the reaction at 750\u00a0\u00b0C in the coexistence of 50\u2013500\u00a0ppm H2S or at 850\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of fuel gas components produced in an air-blown coal gasification process. In the coexistence of a high concentration of syngas (50% CO/25% H2) produced with an O2-blown coal gasifier, the limonite is deactivated almost completely because of the remarkable occurrence of carbon deposition from the CO. On the other hand, the addition of small amounts of CO2 and H2O, which are always included in actual coal-derived fuel gas, to the syngas improves the activity of the limonite, and conversions of NH3\u2013N2 at 750 and 850\u00a0\u00b0C become about 65% and almost 100% without carbon deposition, respectively. When several limonite-based catalysts with alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cations are prepared by the impregnation method and then used in the NH3 decomposition at 750\u00a0\u00b0C in 50% CO/25% H2/5% CO2/3% H2O, fine particles of MgO derived from Mg cations can work more effectively as the promoter, and the 3 mass% Mg-added limonite maintains the high and stable NH3 conversion of almost 100% for 25\u00a0h. In this case, no significant carbon deposition takes place. It is probable that MgO with strong basicity suppresses the carbon formation from CO, and that the limonite-based composite catalyst thus shows the superior performance in the decomposition of NH3 in syngas-rich fuel gas that simulates product gas in O2-blown coal gasification.",

The importance of different substituents was determined by analyzing the transition state for the oxygen transfer using the full system as a model. An analysis of the asymmetric complex has shown an inherent tendency for a decreased selectivity due to the lack of specific bulky groups.

On pure g-C3N4, the first removal of proton from water, the rate-determining step, can not become surmountable at room temperature until an overpotential of 0.88\u00a0V (2.11\u00a0V vs SHE) is appended, in accord with the experimental observation that water photooxidaton hardly occurs on g-C3N4 without any modification. Interestingly, the sulfur doping not only leads to a different reaction mechanism but also lowers the overpotential, consistent with the experimental finding that the reaction rate for OER could be further enhanced by sulfur-modified g-C3N4.

CO dissociation is a highly structure sensitive reaction; on crystal surfaces and large particles CO dissociation is facile only at step sites. However, small (<3\u00a0nm) nanoparticles cannot contain steps and even in macroscopic clusters step concentration is small. Here, density functional theory is used systematically to map several CO dissociation pathways to find and explain the nature of active sites in small BCC iron nanoclusters. It is shown that BCC(100-110) edges of the particle are responsible for the reactivity of small Fe\u2013BCC clusters and that low CO dissociation barrier is achievable even without stepped surfaces. Careful analysis proves the essential role of local geometry at the active site leading to strong interaction between the metal and 2\u03c0* orbitals and accessible, empty states.

     "abstract": "Palladium metal nanoparticles have been applied to hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols in contaminated water using H2 as a clean and sustainable reductant. However, there are two major challenges to widespread technology adoption which are the activity loss caused by nanoparticle aggregation and the difficulty of nanoparticle recovery. In this study, a synthesis of a core-shell structured catalyst with encapsulated Pd nanoparticles has been given and whose catalytic activity has been tested in hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols under 1\u00a0atm H2 at room temperature. The catalyst material consists of a nonporous silica core decorated with Pd nanoparticles that are further encapsulated within an ordered mesoporous silica shell. Well-defined mesopores (2.4\u00a0nm) provide a physical barrier to prevent Pd nanoparticle (\u223c10\u00a0nm) movement, aggregation and detachment from the support into water. Compared with some supported Pd catalysts such as Pd/AC and Pd/Al2O3, SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 exhibits higher catalytic performance. After 5 times of recycling, catalytic activity of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2 reduces slightly and this result confirms the good recyclability of SiO2/Pd@m-SiO2. The function of the mesoporous shell, preventing aggregation of active nanoparticles, suggests a promising general strategy of using metal nanoparticle catalysts for water purification and related aqueous-phase applications.",

In this context, an iron-containing silicotungstate (FeIIIAspSiW) was synthesized using ferric chloride (FeCl3, FeIII), aspartic acid (C4H7NO4, Asp) and silicotungstic acid (H4SiW12O40\u00b7xH2O, SiW) as raw materials and employed as a heterogeneous catalyst for Fenton oxidizing 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). The chemical formula of FeIIIAspSiW is speculated as [Fe(C4H5NO4)]3.5H0.5SiW12O40\u00b714H2O with Keggin-structured SiW12O404\u2212 anion. The FeIIIAspSiW catalyst showed high activity for oxidation of 4-CP by H2O2 ranging from acidic to circumneutral pHs under both the dark and irradiated conditions. Besides, the catalyst also exhibited good regenerability without significant performance drop. The catalytic mechanism in non-irradiated system was related to the Fenton-like catalysis of ferric iron in FeIIIAspSiW. Moreover, the enhanced degradation of 4-CP under irradiation was attributed to the synergistic effect of Fenton-like catalysis of ferric iron and photocatalysis of SiW12O404\u2212 anions in FeIIIAspSiW.",

Under anaerobic conditions (in the absence of gas phase oxygen) limited extent of photo-oxidation of acetone took place on the oxidized TiO2 sample. In the presence of O2 in the gas phase, however, acetone was completely converted to acetates and formates, and ultimately CO2. The initial step in the sequence of photo-induced reactions is the ejection of a methyl radical, resulting in the formation of surface acetates (from the acetyl group) and formates (from the methyl radicals). Acetate ions are also converted to formates, that, in turn, photo-oxidized to CO2. Under the experimental conditions applied the accumulation of carbonates and bicarbonates were observed on the TiO2 surface as the photo-oxidation of acetone proceeded (this was also observed during the course of photo-oxidation of all the other organics studied here).

The purpose of this work is to characterize the N2O reduction to N2 and O by Rh6 clusters. The identified low-lying and degenerate states of Rh6, octahedron with multiplicities of 1 and 7, and a triangular prism with a septet, present many active sites of reduction. The initial steps of the N2O\u00a0+\u00a0Rh6 reaction were studied through different adsorption modes, each one having different multiplicities. The RhRh bonds define the active sites to produce N2O dissociation. The most successful reaction pathway originates when the linear NNO molecule is approached parallel to the RhRh bonds, being this active site the most numerous in the systems. The NO bond breaks in five addressed multiplicities, with 2 and 3 degenerate energy cases in the octahedron. Other approaches studied are: N2O pointing toward the triangular or square face bisectors or to the surface between two RhRh bonds. In these two cases, the N2O molecule moves toward one of the RhRh bonds dissociating over it. Overall, to reduce N2O, the prism structure presents a greater number of different active sites, but the octahedron has more edges, in which the oxide can break. For each calculation, many parameters were obtained and are included in the text: vibrational frequencies, distances between atoms, binding energies, total electronic charges, as well as optimized geometries. An important result of this work is the feature that Rh6 is the smallest nanoparticle having several structures at the ground state, which greatly increases the number of active sites being able to reduce the nitrous oxide contaminant.",

And the excellent photocatalytic ability of the HRGT NSs could be mainly attributed to its enhanced absorption performance for organic pollutants and separation efficiency for photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs both under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation condition.",

In this work, the effect of impregnation solution pH on active NiWS phase formation was studied. Ni/W/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of a W/Al2O3-based catalyst using aqueous nickel-citric acid (CA) solutions (CA/Ni\u00a0=\u00a02) at different pH values (0.3, 3.4, 5.1 and 8.7). The citric acid presence and the impregnation pH influenced the NiWS phase formation. Citric acid provided isolation to supported metal species avoiding strong metal-support interactions, delaying nickel reduction at higher temperatures and decreasing WS2 sintering when compared with a free-citric acid catalyst. An increase of 2.2 times in NiWS fraction was related to these citric acid features. Furthermore, the solution pH influenced the aqueous and supported nickel speciation. Dispersed nickel species were associated with AlO-Ni-Cit surface complexes generated by the adsorption of [Ni(HCit)(Cit)(H2O)4]3\u2212 or [Ni(Cit)2(H2O)4]4\u2212 over alumina surface. In turn, these surface complexes were associated with a higher W sulfidation. 3-fold increases in Ni/W/Al2O3 catalytic activity for hydrodesulfurization of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene were reached by the presence of citric acid and a pH of nickel-citric acid solution around 5. Therefore, the active NiWS species formation in Ni/W/Al2O3 catalysts was improved with citric acid addition and furthermore, it was notably optimized by the control of the nickel species via tuned impregnation pH.",

The physico-chemical characterization of the various samples have been performed using powder X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm measurement at 77\u00a0K, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The framework acidity w.r.t.

In view of this, the role of tailored acidity through Group II cation exchange for optimization of degree of branching during hydroisomerization of long chain n-paraffin is discussed.

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of a transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co) substitution in the BaZrO3 catalyst on the performance of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation (EBDH) with steam. The BaZrO3 catalyst showed a high performance for the EBDH without steam, however the co-feeding of steam produced a significant decrease in the EBDH activity. By partially substituting the Zr site in the BaZrO3 catalyst with Mn or Fe, the dehydrogenation activity was dramatically improved, while the Co-substituted catalyst showed a significantly low activity. In particular, the Fe substitution of a small percentage from 2 to 4% was effective for the drastic enhancement of the EBDH performance with steam. Comparing the styrene yield over the BaFe0.02Zr0.98O3 catalyst with that over the industrial potassium-promoted iron oxide (Fe\u2013K) catalyst, the BaFe0.02Zr0.98O3 catalyst produced a higher styrene yield than the Fe\u2013K catalyst. From the ESR measurement, we found that the Fe-substituted BZO catalyst had the defect\u2013dipole (Fe3+\u2013Vox) in its structure after EBDH with steam. Highly-active BaFe0.02Zr0.98O3 catalyst had a large amount of the defect\u2013dipole and therefore an increase of the oxygen mobility. On the other hand, although low-active catalyst had a large amount of the defect\u2013dipole, but the non-uniformity in the environment of the defect\u2013dipole was increased. Such differences might cause a redox property and a performance for EBDH with steam. The drastic change in activity and environment around the oxygen defect by a small amount of Fe substitution is reported for the first time in the field of perovskite catalysts.",

The turnover numbers increased strongly with the decreasing of V content probably caused by a high V dispersion. The major products were verbenone, trans-sobrerol and campholenic aldehyde. The acid\u2013base properties of V-M(x) affected the distribution of products formed via the isomerization of \u03b1-pinene oxide over Lewis acid sites to campholenic aldehyde while Br\u00f8nsted acid sites brought about the formation of 1,2 pinanediol and trans-sobrerol by hydrolysis and by the opening of oxirane ring. The increase in V content in V-M(x) led to the increase in campholenic aldehyde, 1,2 pinanediol, trans- sobrerol and over oxidation products.

The highest HCHO surface reaction activity is achieved on the silver sample pretreated at 700\u00a0\u00b0C. The state and the dispersion of silver species on the support are strongly related to the pretreatment temperature. The increase of the O2 pretreatment temperature for Ag/MCM-41 catalysts results in the diffusion of Ag2O clusters from outside to inside of the channels. And the amount of Ag2O clusters inside the channels becomes maximum at 600\u00a0\u00b0C. Interestingly, it is found that the smaller metallic Ag nanoparticles coexist with large particles when the catalyst is pretreated at 700\u00a0\u00b0C. It is suggested that Ag2O clusters inside of MCM-41 pores improves the HCHO adsorption capacity and accelerates the formation of HCHO adsorption intermediates, particularly dioxymethylene(DOM) ad-species. And the formed meallic silver particles with smaller size at 700\u00a0\u00b0C plays an essential effect on the formation of formate intermediate and the enhancement of surface reaction activity. It is also concluded that CO2 formation rate from formate is higher than that from DOM species in HCHO oxidation. The decrease of HCHO surface reaction activity after oxygen pretreatment at 800\u00a0\u00b0C may be due to the decrease of the Ag2O clusters inside MCM-41 pores and the aggregation of metallic Ag nanoparticles.",

In this study, the complex mechanism of ethanol formation from syngas on Cu(1\u00a00\u00a00) surface has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with periodic slab models, in which all possible formation pathways of CHx(x\u00a0=\u00a01\u20133) and C2 oxygenates of ethanol precursor, as well as the hydrogenation of C2 oxygenates to ethanol have been considered. Our results suggest that ethanol formation starts with CO hydrogenation to CHO, subsequently, CHO is further hydrogenated to CH3O via CH2O intermediate, CH3O is eventually hydrogenated to CH3OH; alternatively, CH3O dissociation with hydrogen-assisted can also produce CH3; then, CHO insertion into CH3 can lead to the key intermediate CH3CHO, which is successively hydrogenated to ethanol via CH3CH2O intermediates; moreover, among all reactions related to CH3 species, CHO insertion into CH3 to CH3CHO is the most favorable reaction, which is responsible for C2 oxygenates formation. In the overall process of ethanol synthesis, CH3OH is more easily formed than CH3, and ethanol formation is controlled by CH3 formation, which means that the preferable CH3OH formation rather than CH3 is responsible for the low productivity and selectivity of ethanol. Therefore, aiming to obtain high productivity and selectivity to ethanol from syngas on Cu catalyst, we need to selectively modify Cu catalyst by using the promoters and/or supports, which should be able to boost CH3 formation and/or suppress CH3OH formation, this result can be applied to selectively modify and develop the novel Cu-based catalyst towards ethanol formation from syngas.",

Furthermore, the level of cation disorder distribution in Zn\u2013Cr spinel structure affects tremendously both texture parameters and acid\u2013base properties of catalysts which make isobutanol generation more effectively. Most importantly, we first discover that the isobutanol productivity presents approximately linear relationship to the level of cation disorder distribution of Zn\u2013Cr spinel in quantitatively, unambiguously revealing the structure\u2013activity relationship between the activity of isobutanol and the structure of Zn\u2013Cr spinel.",

Synergistic effect between iron and aluminum was achieved showing a satisfactory NO conversation of approximately 95% over Fe-Al-SBA-15-MW at temperature as low as 350\u00a0\u00b0C. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, N2 desorption/adsorption, UV\u2013vis DRS, 27Al MAS NMR, in situ DRIFTS and EPR.

We also did some research about the reaction mechanism of NH3-SCR. Specifically, oligomeric FexOy clusters played an important role in NO oxidation. NH3 were mainly adsorpted to the tetrahedral framework aluminum and existed as NH4+ ions. Although the reaction between adsorbed NH3 and O2 occurred, the reaction rate was much slower than that between NH3 and NO\u00a0+\u00a0O2. Moreover, in situ EPR indicated that Fe3+ species, which did not react with pure NH3, could be easily reduced to Fe2+ by NH3\u00a0+\u00a0NO. When O2 was introduced along with NH3 and NO, the non-paramagnetic Fe2+ species would be reoxidezd to Fe3+, which meant that O2 participated in the reaction cycle and had a great function on reoxidization of Fe2+.

     "abstract": "An unusual autocatalytic photooxidation of 2-methoxybenzyl alcohol has been observed under UV irradiation in aqueous medium. The homogeneous oxidation is catalyzed by the corresponding aldehyde that is also the main oxidation product. The trend of alcohol disappearance rate matches the typical shape of an autocatalytic process, where a crucial and ambivalent role is played by the presence of molecular oxygen. Low oxygen concentrations give rise to a zero-order reaction since the beginning of irradiation, while higher amounts of oxygen reduce the alcohol oxidation rate until the aldehyde reaches a concentration high enough to speed up the alcohol\u2019s conversion. Experiments performed by varying alcohol, aldehyde and oxygen concentrations in both aqueous and organic media suggest that the alcohol oxidation is initially favored by the presence of oxygen. Once the formed aldehyde competes for photon absorption, the oxidation is driven by aldehydes alpha cleavage leading to reactive oxygenated species in aqueous medium. An excess of oxygen quenches the latter processes thus inhibiting/slowing down the reaction.",

Furthermore, a full mapping of the catalytic degradation of MO and product formation was carried out using LC-MS and HPLC. Combining catalytic and spectroscopic data we discuss the protective effect of the PCox matrix on Mn-centers; it allows their rapid redox evolution to higher oxidation states.",

     "abstract": "Any agricultural growth concomitantly increases the demand for pesticides and there is a major concern in monitoring these agents, in order to identify their indiscriminate use, avoid contamination and also to detect prohibited species. Organophosphorus compounds (OPC) comprise many pesticides and chemical warfare, hence, there is an increasing interest for developing efficient dephosphorlylation/detoxification methods. A promising approach is mimicking enzymatic active sites that promote dephosphorylating biological processes, with emphasis for the imidazole (IMZ) group. Notwithstanding, we present a concise and detailed mechanistic study regarding the degradation of the toxic pesticide Paraoxon with IMZ, not yet reported. Results consistently enlighten the powerful nucleophilic detoxifying activity of IMZ by a clear-cut catalysis with the regeneration of the catalyst and formation of less toxic products. Given the impressive high rate enhancements (106-fold), IMZ is among the most promising OPC scavenger reported. 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C and 31P) and mass spectroscopy analysis support that reaction follows exclusively on the phosphorus center, forming a phosphorylated intermediate. Overall, IMZ can be consecutively reused and comprises an optimum scaffold for scavenging OPC, since the catalytic activity and mechanism with IMZ can be extended to other phoshoryl centers (e.g., OPC). The present study sheds light to the strategic area of developing prominent IMZ-derived catalysts targeting detoxifying processes and design of sensors for contaminants in the environment or in food distribution centers.",

The results of in-situ FTIR provided mechanism insights into the catalytic reaction, which supports the following proposal: (i) a nucleophilic substitution on VO species and (ii) attacking by surface oxygen through a electrophilic substitution, then (iii) followed by the cracking of ring structure, and further oxidation of the resulting species to form final products. The above results further suggest that the nucleophilic substitution process and surface reaction are kinetically significant steps for chlorobenzene oxidation, determining the overall rate of the reaction.

Compared to Fe3O4/Al2O3/non-imprinted TiO2, the Fe3O4/Al2O3/molecularly imprinted TiO2 shows a better photocatalytic selectivity toward the template molecules. The enhanced selectivity can be attributed to the chemical interaction and size matching between template molecules and imprinted cavities. Photocatalytic activity studies for 2-nitrophenol degradation indicate an enhanced activity for the composites when the Al2O3 interlayer and molecularly imprinted TiO2 are present in the composites. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the decrease in the migration of photogenerated charge carriers to the inter layer by Al2O3 interlayer and selective photodegradation of template molecules on the imprinted composites. The superparamagnetism of the imprinted composites provides a convenient route for separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture by an external magnet.

     "abstract": "In this study, a type of magnetic recyclable photocatalyst TiO2/Fe3O4/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) ternary nanocomposite was synthesized by hydrolysis in situ. In this method, tetra-n-butyl titanate was used for titanium source, which coated on the surfaces of MWNTs and wrapped Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Nps). Through hydrolysis and calcinations, tetra-n-butyl titanate around MWNTs transformed to teeny abundant TiO2 Nps in situ. A range of analytical techniques including XRD, TEM, SEM, VSM and EDX were employed to reveal the crystal structure, morphology and property of the nanocomposite. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated by degradation of methylene blue (MB) in UV light. Morphology characterization showed that TiO2 Nps with size of about 10\u00a0nm and Fe3O4 Nps with size of about 30\u00a0nm coated on the surfaces of MWNTs. XRD results revealed that anatase TiO2 and cubic spinel Fe3O4 exist in the nanocomposite. The as-synthesized nanocomposite could be rapidly separated from aqueous solutions for repeated use under the external magnetic field. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity compared with pure TiO2. The removal rate of MB for TiO2/Fe3O4/MWNTs nanocomposite with 30\u00a0wt% TiO2 content reached 92.4% after 100\u00a0min UV irradiation, which was about 2 times of pure TiO2. The removal rate of MB was still 90.6% after repeated six times, which indicates that the TiO2/Fe3O4/MWNTs nanocomposite has stable photocatalytic activity as well as magnetic responsiveness. These enhanced and unique properties of TiO2/Fe3O4/MWNTs nanocomposite can be ascribed to the synergistic effect among three components.",

As for 2, due to the electrostatic repulsive force of the two positive charges, the involved two-PPh2 were located in trans-position with the relatively longer P1\u2026P2 distance [8.0231(11)\u00a0\u00c5] to prefer to aa-site coordination in trigonal bipyramid H(alkene)Rh(CO)(P\u2013P) intermediate, which renders less bulky steric hindrance for the regioselectivity to linear aldehyde as a result of low L/B ratio of 1.9. Due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect from the positive-charged imidazolium rings on the neighbored P-atoms, 2 with strong \u03c0-acceptor ability can develop \u03c0-backdonation interaction between Rh and P linkage to favor the dissociation of CO ligand and facilitate the selectivity to nonanals.

The ethylene polymerization activity over the Al-modified Phillips catalyst was increased. The molecular weight (MW) of polymer was decreased with the expansion of molecular weight distribution (MWD) to low MW side, which was in agreement with the decreased energy barrier difference between the chain transfer and chain propagation in DFT calculation. The initiation step undergoing a metallacycle reaction pathway was found through a spin crossover from the quintet energy surface via a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) to the triplet energy surface.

Under UV-light irradiation (\u03bb\u00a0<\u00a0420 nm), the photo activity of BiF3 is 2.1 times higher than that of commercial rutile TiO2 for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB). It is expected that the photo catalysts would be greatly enriched by the discovery of BiF3 as a new, efficient photo catalyst.",

     "abstract": "The catalytic hydrosilylation of carbonyl compounds by the high-valent mono-oxo rhenium(V) complex Re(O)Cl3(PPh3)2 (1) was theoretically investigated to determine the underlying reaction mechanism. According to our results, an ionic mechanistic pathway featuring an SN2\u2013Si structure of the transition state is the most favored. The ionic mechanistic catalytic cycle is initiated by the nucleophilic attack of the \u03b71\u2013silane metal adduct by carbonyl substrates. This attack results in the heterolytic cleavage of the SiH bond and generation of a silycarbenium ion paired with an anionic rhenium hydride, [Re(O)Cl3(H)(PPh3)\u2212[R3SiOCR\u2032R\u2033]+. Then by transferring the hydride from the metal center to the silycarbenium ion yields the silyl ether product. The activation energy of the turnover-limiting step was calculated as \u223c24.1\u00a0kcal/mol with diphenylketone. This value is energetically more favorable than the \u03c3-bond metathesis pathway that involves the initial exchange of silane hydrogen to chloride ligand generating the hydride intermediate, Re(O)HCl2(PPh3)2 by 7.4\u00a0kcal/mol. Furthermore, the [2\u00a0+\u00a02] addition pathway involving the SiH bond that adds across ReO bond requires an activation energy that is \u223c11.1\u00a0kcal/mol higher than that of the ionic mechanistic pathway. The strikingly different behavior of the mono-oxo-rhenium(V) complex and di-oxo-rhenium(V) complex \u2013 that favors a [2\u00a0+\u00a02] addition mechanism \u2013 to activate the SiH bond of silanes is attributed to the absence of an oxo ligand in the mono-oxo-rhenium(V) complex. This decreases the electron density on the rhenium atom, enhances its electrophilicity, thus makes it favorable to prompt the heterolytic cleavage of the SiH bond upon the nucleophilic attack of carbonyl compounds.",

Two sets of competition experiments were performed: the competition between H2O2 and Tris for the surface bound hydroxyl radical (HO) and between O2 and H2O2 for the hydroxymethyl radical (CH2OH) (precursor for formaldehyde). A 5-fold increase in initial concentration of Tris or H2O2 does not lead to a 5-fold increase in CH2O formation (only by a factor of 2\u20133 in the studied concentration range). The O2-dependent enhancement of the final production of CH2O becomes weaker upon increasing the initial concentration of H2O2 from 0.5\u00a0mM to 5\u00a0mM. The final production of CH2O becomes independent of the concentration of Tris when [Tris]0 is above 100\u00a0mM, i.e., the surface is saturated with Tris at this concentration.

To investigate the reasons for the differences in catalytic activities between the FePcTS and FeTPPS systems, the influence of ethanol, a SO4\u2212 scavenger, on the oxidation of TBBPA oxidation was tested. The TOF values for FePcTS/IPS decreased with increasing ethanol concentration, while the catalytic activities for FeTPPS/IPS were not affected by adding ethanol.

A series of characterization of catalyst were carried out to investigate the morphology and materials properties of the precursors and the final porous carbon nanofibers, which including simultaneous thermal analyzer, Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller measurements, UV\u2013vis diffuses reflectance spectra, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the field emission scanning electron microscope and the field emission transmission electron microscope. Foremost, when it was tested as catalyst for the Heck coupling reaction, the porous carbon nanofibers-loaded palladium nanoparticles catalyst exhibited enhanced activity, excellent stabilization and recyclability. Moreover, PS has the possibility of recycling which is important to develop green chemistry. Overall, the as-made carbon nanofibers-supported palladium nanoparticles catalyst with large porosity was prepared in an easy way and showed enhanced activity in comparision with the pure carbon nanofibers-supported palladium nanoparticles catalyst.",

The \u03b3-Al2O3 support itself showed activity for oxidative dehydrogenation from n-butane to n-butenes as well as partial oxidation to CO. The role of Ni oxide on \u03b3-Al2O3 was confirmed that sole Ni oxide loading until 30\u00a0wt% Ni on \u03b3-Al2O3 resulted higher activity and selectivity to butadiene by diminishing partial oxidation related to \u03b3-Al2O3 and enhancing conversion to butadiene. The concerted effect of Bi and Ni in Bi\u2013Ni oxide/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst was confirmed with two methods: (1) partial or full substitution of Bi for 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 Ni of 30\u00a0wt% Ni on \u03b3-Al2O3, and (2) various amounts of Bi addition to 20\u00a0wt% Ni on \u03b3-Al2O3.

The co-precipitation pH value had a strong influence on the Cu crystallite size, the surface morphology, and the surface acidity, leading to the different activities of Cu/ZnO_X catalysts depending on the pH value (X). Catalyst characterization and reaction mechanism clearly revealed that Cu crystallite size and strong acidity of Cu/ZnO_X catalysts played key roles in determining their catalytic activity in this reaction. Yield for methanol showed a tendency to increase with decreasing Cu crystallite size and with increasing strong acidity of Cu/ZnO_X catalysts. Among Cu/ZnO_X catalysts, Cu/ZnO_8 catalyst prepared at pH 8 showed the best catalytic performance due to the finely dispersed Cu particles and the high strong acidity. In addition, the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO_8 catalyst maintained at the same level even after a 60\u00a0h-catalytic reaction, leading to the high feasibility of application of Cu/ZnO_8 catalyst to the continuous reaction system along with the batch reaction system for methanol production from syngas.",

It explains the corresponding enhancement of H2O on the NOx conversion at low temperature. On the other hand, the lack of reductant due to H2 combustion is the reason for the decline of NOx conversion at high temperature. H2O suppresses surface nitrous species formation that has the function of inhibiting H2 combustion, which explains why NOx conversion at high temperature was decreased with the addition of H2O.",

The ImmPd-IL@SBA-15 catalyst along with NaI promoter showed high selectivity to the desired products over several amine compounds such as aliphatic, aromatic, allylic etc. The secondary amines selectively cross double carbonylated with alcohol to give the oxamate derivatives and the primary amines provided the urea as a product by the single carbonylation.

The first Pd/Z was synthesized via the incorporation of palladium oxalate complex (PdOxC) prepared from the functionalization of H2PdCl4 with oxalic acid at pH 5.3 into ZLT. The PdOxC was further modified with drops of HF until pH 3.7 and incorporated into ZLT to synthesize zeolite supported fluoride ion modified PdOxC catalyst (FPd/Z). Their characterization results showed that there is considerable crystallinity loss in Pd/Z, while FPd/Z showed drastic crystallinity loss according to the SEM and XRD results. In addition, the specific surface area and porosity of ZLT increased from 202\u00a0m2/g and 0.13\u00a0cm3/g to 371\u00a0m2/g and 0.23\u00a0cm3/g in Pd/Z, and 427\u00a0m2/g and 0.29\u00a0cm3/g in FPd/Z catalysts, respectively.

The enhancements in the catalysts properties are due to the acidic effect of OxA via the incorporation of PdOxC, while the additional enhancements in the properties and the ISO activity of FPd/Z was ascribed to the acidic effect of fluoride ion modification. It is obvious that OxA functionalization and subsequent fluoride ion modification are highly invaluable toward biofuel production.",

For liquid-phase hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with the Pt/MIL-101 catalyst, owing to high solubility of nitrobenzene in ethanol, the reaction in ethanol went much faster than that in water, furnishing a turnover frequency (TOF) in ethanol up to 18,053\u00a0h\u22121, almost triple of that obtained in water under similar conditions.

Doping of ZnS QDs by three transition metal ions (Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ ions) as dopants have been investigated by various techniques. In the optical absorption studies, a broad absorption band in the wavelength range of 280\u2013300\u00a0nm clearly reveals quantum size effect in ZnS QDs. The crystal structure and the approximate size of QDs were measured by XRD pattern. The average particle size of QDs was found to be around 1\u20133\u00a0nm. In addition, the photocatalytic activities of the prepared ZnS QDs as their abilities to remove methyl violet (MV) cationic dye, as a model molecule, were studied. Effect of the experimental parameters, such as the type of dopant and the amount of QDs, pH of the initial dye solution, irradiation time, ionic strength of reaction media, and initial dye concentration on the decolorization efficiency (DE) of QDs as green nano-semiconductors were studied. The results demonstrated that doped QDS (for 5% of dopants) effectively bleached out MV, showing positive photocatalytic enhancement over pure ZnS nanoparticles.",

Raman spectral studies suggest the partial destabilization of Keggin structure of the catalyst with more than two vanadium atoms per one Keggin unit in the primary structure. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and selectivity to benzaldehyde was influenced by both Cs and V contents. The correlation between catalytic activity and physico-chemical properties of the catalysts suggested that the acidity and redox nature of the catalysts have an important role in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol and these properties are influenced by the amounts of Cs and V, respectively, in heteropoly molybdates. A plausible mechanism for CsxMPAVy/TiO2 catalyzed oxidation of benzyl alcohol has been proposed.",

The results show that CdS QDs were dispersed on the surface of NTP uniformly with strong interface interaction due to the special preparation procedure, where thiolactic acid was used as a linker to bind CdS QDs on NTP in situ.This NTP/CdS system presented much high photocatalytic activity for the mineralization of DCF under visible light irradiation, and its reaction rate constant was significantly enhanced to 1.95 times of NTP and 2.88 times of CdS, respectively. The photocatalytic activity improvement could be attributed to the enhancement of visible light absorption and the reduction of electron-hole pair recombination rate, which were resulted from N-doping, preferred crystallographic orientation and the strong interaction between NTP and highly dispersed CdS QDs.",

The influence of the Zn insertion on the Pt monometallic catalyst properties was evaluated by different physico-chemical techniques, including X-ray diffraction, N2-physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, hydrogen chemisorption, and cyclohexane dehydrogenation as model reaction for platinum accessibility and zinc covering evaluation. On the catalysts, the hexagonal periodic structure of SBA-15 framework was maintained indicating that neither Pt and Zn impregnations, nor thermal treatments affect the organized structure of the support. A decrease of the platinum metallic accessibility was observed with the increase in the Zn concentration in the materials, which was explained, on the basis of the TEM analysis, by a poisoning of the platinum accessible sites by zinc species. For the citral hydrogenation, Pt/SBA-15 monometallic catalyst is very active, with 100% conversion obtained after 30\u00a0min reaction time, but very poorly selective in unsaturated alcohols. Zinc addition led to an inhibition of the hydrogenating activity, in agreement with the decrease of the active surface, but contributed to an increase in the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols. Selectivity in unsaturated alcohol was observed to reach a maximum of 75%, for a Zn content equal to 0.3\u00a0wt.%, that is a very interesting value if compared to performances obtained with other more classical dopant including titania and germanium.",

     "abstract": "Effect of different levels of slight carboxymethylation of cotton cellulose was investigated for improved attachment of photocatalytic TiO2 nanoparticles on cotton fabrics using sodium monochloroacetate under an alkali condition. Surface modification was confirmed by FTIR using two characteristic peaks located at 1734 and 1594\u00a0cm\u22121 which occur due to presence of carboxylic and carboxylate functionality on modified cotton fabrics. These fabrics were then grafted with TiO2 nanoparticles (Aeroxide\u00a9P25) using a special apparatus to obtain self-cleaning fabrics. Morphology of the treated samples was characterized by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy which showed uniform coating of TiO2 nanoparticles on surface modified fabrics. Crystallinity of the coatings was evaluated using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. Photocatalytic performance was evaluated for methyl orange as a model stain under UV-A and B exposure (200\u00a0W/m2) using a spectrophotometer. Results indicated that the number of surface carboxylic acid groups increase with the increase of concentration of sodium monochloroacetate used in surface modification reaction. Higher degree of surface modification increased the loading of TiO2 nanoparticles on cotton fabrics and hence the degree of photocataltic stain removal activity.",

Three supported Cu-catalysts (Cu/SiO2, Cu/Al2O3, and Cu/ZnO) were prepared by the typical precipitation method, and Cu/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance with an 89.5% yield to 2-MF. A series of characteristic results indicated that the high yield of 2-methylfuran on Cu/SiO2 catalyst was assigned to synergistic effect of metal and the weak acid sites. Among them, Cu/ZnO catalyst exhibited maximum furfuryl alcohol selectivity because of the large Cu particles, while Cu/Al2O3 catalyst had low 2-methylfuran selectivity due to the insufficient weak acid sites. For Cu/SiO2 catalyst, the highly dispersed Cu particles and the strong metal-support interaction are propitious to its superior catalytic activity. Therefore, copper species are composed on different supports as a result of the different interaction of metal-support to affect their catalytic activity, while products selectivity is related to the acidic property of catalyst.

The obtained catalytic results were correlated with the catalyst structure, which was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, H2-TPR and BET. The catalytic results indicated that the CuFe mixed oxide samples exhibited superior performance compared to its analogous single nano-oxide catalysts. The influence of the reaction condition variables, such as the solvent, reaction temperature, time, and amount of H2O2 oxidant, were investigated. Under optimized conditions, CuFe resulted in benzene conversion of 44% at a phenol selectivity of 91% and a corresponding combined hydroquinone/catechol/benzoquinone selectivity of 9%. In addition, the catalytic activity of the nano-oxide CuFe was significantly affected by the different calcination temperatures due to the induced catalyst structure, which was confirmed by the characterization results. This enhanced activity was due to the structural phases and redox modification resulting from the interface between the Cu and Fe metals, which was caused by varying calcination temperatures. The activity of CuFe does not require the formation of the typical favored CuFe2O4 spinel to achieve a highly active catalyst, which results from the enhanced redox potentials. CuFe is highly recyclable due to its magnetic nature, which results in an excellent ecofriendly catalyst for the direct synthesis of phenol from benzene hydroxylation.",

Two synthetic routes were applied for the preparation of the catalysts by mixing the polyether and TiCl4 with \u03b4-MgCl2 support in the same step or at different stages of the catalyst synthesis. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies revealed a clear interaction between PEG and \u03b4-MgCl2 inducing changes in the chain conformation of the polyether. If PEG was added at the same stage with TiCl4, a yellow PEG/TiCl4 complex was formed and the activity of the catalyst was decreased.

     "abstract": "In this study, undoped and Er-doped PbSe (ErxPb1\u2212xSe) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method. Synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. Photocatalytic activity of undoped and Er-doped PbSe was evaluated by photocatalytic decolorization of Malachite Green (MG) under visible light irradiation. XRD analysis confirmed that the samples were crystallized in face-centered cubic PbSe phase. SEM images demonstrated that the size distributions of the undoped and 4% Er-doped PbSe particles were in the range of 60\u201370\u00a0nm and 50\u201360\u00a0nm, respectively. XPS analysis represented that Er ions were successfully incorporated into the PbSe crystal lattice. Decolorization efficiency was increased from 64.89%, in the presence of undoped PbSe, to 95.60% in the presence of 4% Er-doped PbSe at 75\u00a0min of irradiation time. The order of inhibitory effect of different inorganic ions was found to be as Cl\u2212\u00a0>\u00a0F\u2212\u00a0>\u00a0HCO3\u2212\u00a0>\u00a0CO32\u2212. The presence of peroxydisulfate as enhancer significantly increased the decolorization efficiency. Synthesized nanoparticles exhibited good reusability after 10 sets of photocatalytic reaction. The photocatalytic degradation process can be explained in terms of pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The main degradation intermediates produced in the photocatalytic degradation of MG were identified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) analysis, and a possible pathway was proposed.",

The Ni\u2013W2C/mpg\u2013C3N4 is demonstrated much higher catalytic activity and selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene than the supported Ni\u2013W2C catalyst on activated carbon (Ni\u2013W2C/AC) and mesoporous carbon (Ni\u2013W2C/CMK-3), and the developed Ni\u2013W2C/mpg\u2013C3N4 also exhibits excellent catalytic properties for the selective hydrogenation of various substrates comprising the extra reducible functionalized groups besides nitro group to diverse functionalized arylamines, industrially important compounds, offering more than 92% of yield with 100% selectivity, which may be ascribed to the strengthened mass transfer by using mesoporous support, intentified synergistic effect between Ni\u2013W2C/mpg\u2013C3N4 and Lewis acid owing to the basicity of mpg-C3N4, as well as the improved reducibility of NiO-WO3 and the dispersion of Ni\u2013W2C. It can be also found that the developed catalyst could be easily recovered by filtration and recycled many times without visible loss in its catalytic performance. The significantly improved catalytic properties of supported Ni\u2013W2C catalyst fabricated by using mpg-C3N4 as a superior carrier in the presence of Lewis acid allows it to be a promising candidate for the clean and highly-efficient synthesis of diverse functionalized arylamines through the selectivie hydrogenation of substituted nitroarenes.",

     "abstract": "The application of a new class of alkylammonium salts as phase-transfer catalysts was investigated. These salts are tetra(4-thiaalkyl) ammonium bromides, and the key questions of the study focus on how the incorporation of a sulfur atom in the alkyl chains affects the efficacy of the salts as phase-transfer catalysts. Employing the nucleophilic substitution of cyanide for bromide on 1-bromopentane as a model reaction, reaction rate constants and activation energies are evaluated. The kinetic parameters obtained using the tetrathiaalkylammonium salts are compared to those obtained using their tetraalkylammonium analogs. The general trend is that the presence of sulfur in the alkyl chains reduces the reaction rates and increases activation energies. This trend is analyzed both in terms of computational modeling and experimental distribution coefficients to determine the cause of the slower reaction rates. Thiaquats are shown to distribute more into the aqueous phase than traditional quat salts of similar chain length, resulting in lower organic phase concentrations. Quantum calculations indicate stronger ion pairing for the thiaquats, increasing activation energies and slowing reaction rates. Thus, differences in rate enhancements are attributable both to phase distribution and ion pairing effects.",

In the presence of Et2AlCl and CCl3COOEt, these complexes displayed high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization even at elevated reaction temperature, depending on ligand structures.

     "abstract": "While the oxidative desulfurization (ODS) of aromatic sulfur compounds, such as dibenzothiophene (DBT), in ionic liquids (ILs) has attracted great attention, the role of ILs is still not well elucidated at the molecular level. Focusing on a model system, i.e., the ODS of DBT using H2O2 as oxidant in 1-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([HMIm]BF4) IL, this work presents a theoretical elucidation of the dual role of IL as a catalyst and an extractant by performing density functional theory calculations. It is found that as a catalyst, both the cation and anion of the IL play important roles in the oxidation process of DBT to dibenzothiophene sulfone (DBTO2): they act respectively, as the donor of one intermolecular hydrogen bond and the acceptor of another intermolecular hydrogen bond to promote the OO and OH cleavages of H2O2 and to stabilize transition state structures. With the assistance of the IL, the barriers of two elementary steps involved in the transformation from DBT to DBTO2 are reduced to 13.1 and 23.8\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 from 32.1 and 37.8\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121, respectively. On the other hand, as an extractant both the cation and anion of IL show stronger interactions with DBTO2 than with DBT, which is attributed to the larger polarity of the former than the latter. Furthermore, calculated interaction energies of the cation\u2013molecule complexes are larger than those of the anion\u2013molecule complexes, indicating that the cation plays a more important role in the extraction and separation process of aromatic sulfur compound from fuels.",

The experimental results of fresh catalysts suggested that Ce mainly existed on the surface of the catalyst and was well dispersed in the form of Ce3+, and its interaction with copper could improve the dispersion of copper species and increase the amount of isolated Cu2+ ions, so that CuCe-SAPO-34 performed better NH3-SCR activity than Cu-SAPO-34. After hydrothermal aging at 800\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h, the characterization results indicated that the introduction of cerium effectively improved the textural and structural stability of SAPO-34 since more cations at the exchange site of SAPO-34 could decrease the concentration of SiO(H)Al bond which was closely related to the damage of the SAPO-34 framework. Moreover, the addition of Ce could prevent the decrease of acid densities, promote the redistribution of CuO during hydrothermal aging and provide higher amount of isolated Cu2+ ions, leading to superior hydrothermal stability of CuCe-SAPO-34 catalyst.",

Thus, TS-GNSs and TS-GNRs exhibit prominent photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet irradiation. The degradation efficiency of RhB is nearly 80% for TS-GNRs and 100% for TS-GNSs within 25\u00a0min. The lower degradation efficiency of TS-GNRs is due to the lower charge mobility of GNRs, which demonstrates that the excellent charge mobility of graphene plays a crucial role in composites for photodegradation.",

Some authors claim a stability effect whereas others claim that surface MoO3, segregated from bulk, is the active phase.In order to clarify the role of Mo excess on the catalytic performances, catalysts were prepared by Mo surface loading of stoichiometric Fe2(MoO4)3. No crystalline MoO3 was detected even for the sample prepared with five monolayers (maximum number) of MoO3. XPS data reveals a Mo surface enrichment even for the stoichiometric mixed oxide sample. All the samples presented Mo/Fe atomic ratio higher than the stoichiometric value (1.5). Adding of MoO3 monolayers seems to promote surface aggregation of Mo species.Catalytic data showed that Mo surface enrichment of the stoichiometric phase leads to an increase of formaldehyde yield for loadings higher than 0.5 monolayers. The observed behavior seems to result from a compromise between the higher catalytic activity of the Fe2(MoO4)3 phase and the lower activity but higher selectivity of the MoO3 phase. A cooperative effect between the MoO3 and the molybdate phase seems to dictate the catalytic performances.",

Several techniques were used (low-angle XRD, SBET, TPD-NH3, DRS, FT-IR of framework vibration, FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine, SEM and HRTEM). These systems were then used as catalysts in the o-xylene hydroisomerization carried out in a batch reactor at 300\u00a0\u00b0C and atmospheric H2 pressure. The catalyst characterization demonstrated that the modification of Ti-HMS substrate with Ga by post-synthesis grafting yields high surface area substrates with good Ga dispersion and bimodal distribution of gallium species. On the basis of lattice expansion observed from XRD data together with the increase of absorption band due to vibration of Si\u2013O\u2013Ga linkages, it is inferred that Ga species are incorporated into the silica framework. Moreover, textural analysis revealed that highly dispersed Ga2O3 species are deposited within the inner pores of the substrate. The largest o-xylene conversion observed for the Ti-HMS-2.5Ga sample containing the largest Ga loading is related to the heterogeneous distribution of its Ga species and its large acidity. Upon reaction conditions employed, the o-xylene hydroisomerization over Ti-HMS-Ga proceeds exclusively via intramolecular mechanism (formation of m- and p-xylenes) and hydrogenation of benzene aromatic ring of o-, p- and m-xylenes did not occur.",

Pre-reduction treatment leads to the consumption of surface adsorbed oxygen species and the formation of Fe and Fe2+ species, which are active for propane dehydrogenation. For one thing, propane hydrogenolysis is strongly inhibited due to the large size (around 30\u00a0nm) of Fe grains. For another, propylene cracking and the generation of carbon and FexC species are largely suppressed in the absence of surface electronegative oxygen species, hence inhibiting propane cracking and hydrogenolysis reactions, resulting in greatly improved dehydrogenation performance.",

The synthesis of DENs using amine terminated generation 4 poly(amido)amine dendrimer (G4-PAMAM-NH2) was successfully demonstrated.

The rate is independent of [OH\u2212] in the studied range. The anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) has no effect on the rate. The presence of small amount of any of these cationic surfactants well below its critical micelle concentration markedly inhibits the rate of reaction suggesting a pre-micellar aggregation between the substrate and surfactant monomers. The kinetic data have been analyzed in terms of earlier reported models (Piszkiewicz's co-operativity model and Raghavan and Srinivasan's model) for micellar catalysis. The binding constants between the substrate and the surfactants evaluated from the two models are in good agreement. Three dimensional structure of the pre-micellar aggregate controls the approach of the nucleophile water molecule to the reaction center. The planar structure of the pyridinium head group of CPC provides less steric hindrance to the attacking water molecule that leads to the least enthalpy of activation for CPC among the three surfactants. The association between the negatively charged substrate and the cationic surfactant is favored owing to electrostatic as well as hydrophobic interactions.

These results can be attributed to the fact that the large expansion in basal spacing for the Mt permitted the catalyst to be eluted and HA to be inserted into the Mt layer.

The incorporation of promoters was observed to have a profound impact on the physic-chemical and catalytic properties of catalysts. It was shown that the dispersion of cobalt species could be improved by the addition of TiO2, resulting in higher catalytic activity on Co/TiO2\u2013MS catalyst (abbreviated as Co/Ti\u2013MS). Meanwhile, the reducibility of cobalt species in Co/Ti\u2013MS was apparently inhabited due to the strong Co\u2013TiO2 interaction, while this effect was suppressed upon a small addition of ZrO2. With the further addition of ZrO2, the reducibility and dispersion of cobalt species were increased simultaneously, resulting in the improved activity. In addition, the H2 chemisorption was enhanced while CO adsorption was suppressed by the incorporation of ZrO2, which increased the H/C ratios on the surface of Co-based catalysts, and promoted the hydrogenation of surface carbon species. Consequently, methane selectivity was enhanced and heavy hydrocarbons selectivity was suppressed in FTS product distribution. The incorporation of promoters into Co/MS catalysts also improved the electron density of cobalt species due to the electron transfer from support to Co via the MOSi structure (M\u00a0=\u00a0Ti or Zr). The electron enrichment of cobalt species on Co/Ti\u2013MS catalyst caused lower H/C ratio, resulting in higher selectivity to heavy hydrocarbons and lower selectivity to methane.",

The experimental results showed the catalysts have good catalytic performance for thioetherification reaction, but the isomerization and hydrogenation reactions of olefins over the catalysts can inhibit thioetherification reaction. As reaction temperature increases, the isomerization and hydrogenation reactions of olefins increase rapidly, however, the inhibition of thioetherification reaction also increases. The sulfur distribution and molecular structures of sulfur compounds in the products were analyzed by the gas chromatograph with sulfur chemiluminescence detector (GC-SCD) and the gas chromatograph/mass spectra spectrometry (GC/MS). Two possible routes of thioetherification reaction could be observed. At low temperature, the major pathway involves a direct addition of 1-butanethiol to the terminal carbon of double bond of 1-hexene. In this mechanism, the main product is anti-Markovnikov adduct. At a higher temperature, the CS bond of 1-butanethiol can be subsequently cleaved, and the adsorbed -SH species can be formed on the catalysts. On the same time, abundant 1-hexene can be absorbed on the catalysts, as well. Therefore, the adsorbed SH species can then recombine with adsorbed 1-hexene to form new hexyl-mercaptans, which can continue to produce another kind of thioether (di-hexyl sulfide) with adsorbed 1-hexene. Similar with the first reaction route, the thioether of the anti-Markonikov adduct still dominates in the product.",

Furthermore, the micellar system with high surfactant concentration (C16QAS; >150\u00a0mM) made the reaction faster giving >99% conversion to selectively desired product (>99%) within 30\u00a0min The large interface created by C16QAS micelles in the aqueous medium at high surfactant concentration makes the reaction faster by facilitating the interaction of hydrophobic reactants and water soluble catalyst (OH\u2212 ions). The activation of benzaldehyde molecules, their localization preferably near the interface and stabilization of enolate ions (reactive intermediates) by micellar system at high surfactant concentration were observed to be promoting the cross reaction selectively to the desired product.",

The oligolactide synthesis is much more efficacious in the presence of zinc initiator than in the case of tin compound. Moreover, under an appropriate molar ratio of zinc complex/LA/alcohol, the catalytic reaction can yield either oligomers or alkyl lactyllactates or alkyl lactates. DFT calculations concerning the 1:1 or 1:2 complexes of methyl lactyllactate with methanol reveals a selectivity mechanism of zinc complex towards one of these processes. As for the tin compound, it appears not selective towards alcoholysis and hence oligolactide must always be accompanied by the formation of alkyl lactyllactate. Hence, when a low-molecular-weight oligomer constitutes a synthetic priority, quenching the reaction with hexanes or heptane is much more effective.",

The structural and surface property of the catalyst, the performance and mineralization during PNT degradation, and \u2022OH/H2O2 identification were studied. The precursors of the catalyst, i.e. MnFe2(OH)8 and NiFe2(OH)8, showed certain magnetic properties and a superior catalytic activity for ozonation enhancement than spinel ferrites. Spinel ferrites containing manganese initiate an ozone mass transfer into the solution, where the critical intermediate (H2O2) is generated. The manganese ferrite spinel triggers H2O2 decomposition in the presence of ozone and generates \u2022OH for the mineralization of PNT and its intermediates. Spinel ferrites involved nickel catalyzed ozone decomposition and generate H2O2 and \u2022OH. All catalysts showed a weak heavy metal leaching, which suggests that the heterogeneous reaction dominates the catalytic reaction and the resultant effluent is safe for the aqueous environment. The magnetic variation of catalysts involving nickel is insignificant, suggesting that the catalyst can be reused many times.

The DFT results show that the NO splitting step of N2O molecule controls the whole catalytic cycle, and the binuclear Cu-ZSM-5 has not suffered from O2 inhibition. Moreover, some experimental work reports O2 inhibition is not observed at high Cu loading, which is in agreement with the present calculation. These findings suggest that the catalytic behavior of binuclear Cu-ZSM-5 is different from that of mononuclear. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis confirms the rate-limiting step in the binuclear Cu-ZSM-5 system is the N2O dissociation step, and the rate constant indicates that high temperature could accelerate the N2O dissociation.

Here we investigate how the performance of thiolate-modified Pt/Al2O3 catalysts is affected by recycling and regeneration, using the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol as a probe reaction. Although modification of Pt catalysts with 3-phenyl-1-propanethiol results in high selectivity due to a ligand-specific interaction between modifier and reactant during the first use of a given catalyst, repeated recycling was shown to decrease the efficacy of this mechanism due to increasing disorder in the monolayer. However, selectivity and order could be stabilized using a thiol regeneration step or by feeding dilute concentrations of thiols in the reaction mixture. Similarly, aging in air was shown to decrease the order of the thiol and reduced the selectivity improvement of both a 3-phenyl-1-propanethiol and an octadecanethiol (C18) modified Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. These studies show that the ligand-specific interactions between the SAM and the reactant are particularly sensitive to conditions that can degrade the monolayer.",

Most of the prepared catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity and selectivity for gasoline than did a simple zeolite. The catalysts prepared using a larger amount of malic acid developed mesoporous structures and showed higher olefin/paraffin ratios and research octane numbers (RONs) than the simple zeolite and a catalyst with a microporous structure. When \u03b2 zeolite-containing catalysts were used, the ratio of multi/single branched products in the gasoline fraction reached more than 0.40, which was considerably larger than that obtained using a simple zeolite. When the yields of gasoline, single-branched products and multi-branched products were plotted against the conversion of soybean oil, approximately linear relationships were observed for every plot. When the yields of gasoline and single-branched products were compared at the same conversion, the yields from the HY zeolite-containing catalysts were higher than those from the \u03b2 zeolite-containing catalysts. These results were consistent with those for the catalytic cracking of VGO previously reported. However, the yields of multi-branched products from \u03b2 zeolite-containing catalysts were higher than those from HY zeolite-containing catalysts. This result was different for VGO cracking, where the yield of multi-branched products from HY zeolite was higher. Furthermore, the RON of gasoline and the yield of aromatic compounds were higher than those for the catalytic cracking of VGO.",

In some cases the increase of ethylene concentration proceeds to the narrowing of the molecular weight distribution of the resulting polyethylene and an increase in the calculated value of propagation rate constant. These effects were shown to be most pronounced at low ethylene pressure and increased concentration of an activator (AlEt3).

KCC-1 was prepared using a hydrothermal method and has a dandelion-like shape, high surface area, and easy accessibility; KCC-1 can also be functionalized with 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane. The mercaptopropyl groups on the fibers act as robust anchors for the immobilization of Ni@Au NPs, thus preventing the aggregation of the Ni@Au NPs. We investigated the catalytic performance of the Ni@Au/KCC-1 nanocatalyst by reducing 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4 as a probe reaction. The resulting Ni@Au/KCC-1 nanocatalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity to Ni@Au NPs, which may be attributed to the high accessibility of the KCC-1 support material. To some extent, it also may be due to the poor aggregation of Ni@Au NPs on the KCC-1 nano-silica support. The Ni@Au/KCC-1 nanocatalyst also showed high catalytic activity when used to reduce 2-nitroaniline. It is noteworthy that using Ni cores to fabricate the active sites Ni@Au NPs resulted in a lower amount of Au needed than is typical, because most of the Au-NPs catalyzed reactions occur on the surfaces of the NPs. In addition, the Ni cores give the Ni@Au/KCC-1 nanocatalyst superparamagnetic properties that increase its ease of recovery by a powerful magnet, allowing for it to be reused.

     "abstract": "Organotin catalysts are used to catalyze the reaction of isocyanates and alcohols in the manufacture of urethanes. Therefore it is important to understand the mechanism of the catalysis to get a greater control of the reaction to obtain specific properties of the final product. Until now the proposed mechanism related to organotin catalysis of urethane formation is based on the mechanism suggested by Bloodworth and Davies (1965) on the reaction between trialkyltin alkoxide and phenyl isocyanate. In the present work computational and experimental methods were used to investigate the interaction between trialkyltin alkoxide and phenyl isocyanate. The computational results agree with the experimental results reported by Bloodworth and Davies. The computational investigation also provided further insight into the interaction mechanism. The investigations indicate that initially the isocyanate oxygen is attracted towards the tin atom of the organotin alkoxide, which subsequently undergoes an insertion reaction to form an organotin O-carbamate (methyl tributylstannyl phenylcarbonimidate), which rearranges to form an organotin N-carbamate (methyl phenyl(tributylstannyl)carbamate). Model compound studies of the urethane formation in the presence of trialkyltin catalyst using 13C NMR and FT-IR data show that the reaction goes through a termolecular mechanism. This is also confirmed by comparing reaction rates between trialkyl and dialkyl tin as catalyst at similar tin content for the reaction between aromatic isocyanate and alcohol and comparing with computationally calculated intrinsic reaction coordinate profile of different transition states for similar interactions.",

Among Cr1\u2013Cr8, the highest activity was achieved for Cr1/MAO at room temperature with production of PE with highest molecular weight, indicating that replacement of both tBu groups in Cr1 with Ph groups, or one PtBu2 with the N (imine) arm, resulted in a lower catalytic activity and lower Mw.",

The influence on the catalytic performance of the composition of the atmosphere surrounding the Ni/YSZ catalyst during the calcination step was also analysed. Temperature-programmed reduction experiments showed remarkable differences in the reduction profile and the degree of reduction of the catalysts as a function of both the support used and the calcination conditions. Ni/YSZ-O2, the catalyst calcined under an oxygen-poor atmosphere, presented a higher reducibility as a consequence of the higher number of oxygen vacancies in the surface of the support. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst gave the lowest CH4 and CO2 reaction rates as a consequence of its low reducibility due to the formation of Ni aluminate. The Ni/CeO2 catalyst showed the lowest H2/CO molar ratio for the tri-reforming process. This result can be explained on considering the higher basicity of this catalyst, as shown by CO2-TPD experiments. The CeO2 and \u03b2-SiC catalysts had the best characteristics as catalytic supports for the tri-reforming process.",

It was found that RF plasma treatment at much lower temperature can produce metal particles with more surface defects and induces strong metal\u2013support interaction (SMSI) as compared to the thermal reduction treatment, which favors achievement of excellent catalysis performance. However, RF plasma treated catalysts exhibits relatively poor thermal stability at high temperature because further thermal reduction of plasma treated samples can reduce the number of surface defects, change the distribution of Pd(1\u00a00\u00a00) and Pd(1\u00a01\u00a01) planes and weaken the SMSI effect to some extent.

The as-prepared heterostructured Zn0.8Cd0.2S/g-C3N4 heterostructures showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB, with compared to the pure Zn0.8Cd0.2S and g-C3N4. An optimum photocatalytic activity was observed over 50\u00a0wt% Zn0.8Cd0.2S incorporated g-C3N4 nanocomposite. The superior photocatalytic performance of Zn0.8Cd0.2S/g-C3N4 could be ascribed to its strong absorption in the visible region and low recombination rates of photoinduced electron\u2013hole pairs because of the heterojunction formed between Zn0.8Cd0.2S and g-C3N4. We proposed the scheme for electron-hole separation and transport for the visible-light-driven Zn0.8Cd0.2S/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst. It was found that the photodegradation of MB molecules is mainly attributed to the oxidation action of the generated O2\u2212 radicals and partly to the action of hvb+ via direct hole oxidation process.",

The addition of moderate amount of cobalt can promote the reduction of Mo species to Mo\u03b4+ species. With increasing the Co content, the CO adsorption strength on Mo\u03b4+ species increased and was up to the maximum when Co/Mo\u00a0=\u00a00.5. Further increasing the Co content led to the decrease of surface Mo\u03b4+ species because that the formation of CoMoO3 inhibited the further reduction of Mo4+ species. Increasing the reduction temperature resulted in the decrease of the surface cobalt content significantly. The CO adsorption strength on Mo\u03b4+ species reached a maximum at 773\u00a0K. Higher reduction temperature caused the decrease of CO adsorption strength because of the sintering of catalyst. It suggested that the surface Mo\u03b4+ species is responsible for the alcohol synthesis. The high activity of the K\u2013Co\u2013Mo/C catalysts with Co/Mo ratio of 0.5 for alcohol synthesis should be attributed to its high Mo\u03b4+ content on the surface.",

Therefore, they can be used as excellent catalysts for visible-light-driven degradation of methyl orange (MO).

The strongly acidic solution of MO facilitates producing free radicals of OH in this catalytic system.

     "publication date": "12-2014",
     "abstract": "Shaped metal particles are known to possess distinct catalytic properties, which is often attributed to the catalytic activities of different particle facets. In this contribution, propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles of different shapes is investigated by a combination of experiments and DFT calculations. The selectivity toward propylene and catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation can be enhanced by shaping Pt nanoparticles under industrially relevant conditions. Octahedral particles (12.0\u00a0nm) dominated by the Pt(1\u00a01\u00a01) surface have higher selectivity toward propylene production and better stability than cubic particles (11.5\u00a0nm) that are dominated by the Pt(1\u00a00\u00a00) surface. Combined experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for the C\u2013H bond cleavage in propylene dehydrogenation on Pt(1\u00a01\u00a01) compared to Pt(1\u00a00\u00a00) and Pt(2\u00a01\u00a01) contribute to the higher selectivity toward propylene by lowering the formation possibility of the deeply dehydrogenated intermediates. When coke is formed on the Pt surface, the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms is shifted farther below the Fermi level, leading to the deactivation of Pt catalyst. Our DFT calculations provide a rational interpretation of the experimental observations regarding the shape effects on propane dehydrogenation.",

The components of these nanomaterials were characterized by means of XRD, XPS, N2 adsorption/desorption, TGA, SEM, and TEM microscopy techniques. The XRD spectra of ceria and Cu@CeO2_1 (3.4\u00a0wt% copper loading) revealed a slight shift of the position of the planes with a small increase of the crystal lattice parameters, which can be explained by an eventual insertion of Cu0 in interstitial sites and/or a partial substitution of Ce4+ by Cu2+. Cu@CeO2 nanomaterials were found to be efficient catalysts for the N-arylation of indole with various aryl bromides to produce good yields of the desired products. The decrease in the catalytic activity of the catalyst during the reuse was probably due to oxidation of Cu0 to Cu2+ and its poisoning of KBr that was formed in situ.",

The dependence of microstructure and property evolution, such as crystal phase, morphology, N-doping and optical response property, on the hydrothermal time was investigated systematically, and their photocatalytic activities for the degradation of methylene blue are evaluated under visible light irradiation. The results showed that the structure of cubic TiN with the morphology of irregular bulk gradually collapses to form the structure of anatase TiO2 with the morphology of well-defined plate during the hydrothermal process with the extension of hydrothermal time. The bonds of TiN in TiN are gradually replaced by OTiN and TiON due to the oxidation effect, which realizes the N-doping of TiO2 plates.

Various copper salts have been applied in the photocatalytic proton reduction together with [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]PF6 as photosensitizer (PS) and triethylamine (TEA) as electron donor. Among them, copper(I) iodide showed the best productivity, resulting in a TONCu of 260 and a stability of 4 days. The addition of 2,2\u2032-bipyridine (bpy) led to a significant improvement of the catalytic system. Application of 2\u00a0equiv. of bpy and an increased amount of PS improved the stability as well as the productivity (TONCu 711). Remarkably, this catalytic system was reactivated seven times with only further addition of fresh PS and TEA. Consequently, this copper-based WRC was shown to be active for more than 48 days reaching a maximum TONCu of >3900, which is in the same order of magnitude as previously known noble metal WRCs. Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM measurements revealed a part transformation of the molecularly-defined copper precursor into Cu containing nanoparticles of 5\u201310\u00a0nm size. Additionally, by XAS measurements the conversion of the copper(I) salts into Cu(0) compounds under light irradiation was observed. With respect to low costs and high abundance of copper these WRCs are an appropriate alternative for noble metal based catalysts.",

It is demonstrated that for this alkyne homocoupling reaction, elevated temperature is needed to solubilize copper and activate it, likely by production of soluble molecular copper-piperidine complexes. Once this activation occurred, the reaction can occur at room temperature, giving good yields of the desired product. Copper oxide is shown to interact differently on the two supports; CuO supported on TiO2 is more dispersed and accessible than CuO supported on \u03b3-Al2O3. Less copper leaches from 10CuO-TiO2 than from 10CuO-Al2O3 at room temperature. Nevertheless, copper species that leach from 10CuO-TiO2 are more active than the species leached from 10CuO-Al2O3, as some of the copper leached from alumina likely exists as fine, inactive CuO nanoparticles. Piperidine has multiple roles in this reaction: it acts as solvent, base, as well as an important ligand. The precatalyst 10CuO-TiO2 is reused three times, with improved performance after each cycle. Nevertheless, it cannot be considered a recyclable catalyst, but rather a reusable solid precatalyst that produced new soluble active copper species in each cycle.",

Modification of activated carbon by reduction with hydrogen or by nitrogenation with ammonia causes partial removal of the oxygen functional groups leading to a decrease in the catalytic activity towards propene and a simultaneous increase in isopropanol conversion to acetone (basic centres formation). The influence of above modifications on the catalytic activity of activated carbons is confirmed by investigation of cyclisation of acetonylacetone.

This behavior is different from other oxygen deficient perovskites like LaCoO3 and LaFeO3 in which lattice incorporation stabilizes the active species against sintering. Water gas shift reaction was used as a probe reaction to understand the effect of this difference in the activity. In case of LaMnO3, failure in lattice substitution leads to sintering and deactivation at high synthesis temperatures (\u2265700\u00a0\u00b0C) in both impregnated and doped samples. In doped samples, however, a strong interaction of Pt species with a persistent amorphous phase prevents sintering at lower synthesis temperature thereby enhancing the activity when compared to impregnated sample.

At least two different reaction types exist: (1) one brought about by the highly catalytically active Venturello complex [PO4{WO(O2)2}4]3\u2212, which was generated by reactions of the Zr/Hf-containing POMs with hydrogen peroxide, and (2) the reaction with active species formed on Zr/Hf clusters in the POMs. In the first type, the original sandwich structures are not maintained during the reactions (as shown in 1, 2, 3, and 4), but in the second type, the sandwich structures are maintained (as seen in 5 and 6). 7 was inactive. The reaction, (5\u00a0+\u00a0cis-cyclooctene)\u00a0+\u00a0H2O2, was explicitly influenced by changing the reaction time of 5 and olefin, before addition of H2O2, indicating a significant interaction between 5 and olefin, such as coordination of olefin to the POM. Thus, for homogeneous olefin epoxidation by hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by di-Zr/Hf clusters, a new mechanism is proposed through olefin-coordinated species to di-Zr/Hf centers.",

While activation with EtAlCl2, in toluene produced Friedel-Crafts toluene-alkylated products, the use of hexane and chlorobenzene gave predominantly C4 and C6 oligomers. On the other hand, activation with MAO in toluene led to the formation of mainly C4, C6 and C8 oligomers.

     "abstract": "Titanium dioxide and titanate nanotubes (TiNTs) have attracted much attention because of their unique properties, which allow their application in energy conversion and storage devices, magnetic materials, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. However, these materials can only absorb UV radiation, which is approximately 5% of the incident solar radiation on Earth. The doping of TiNTs with metals or nonmetals, such as nitrogen, is one strategy that is used to make these materials sensitive to visible light. Here, we obtained TiNTs by hydrothermally treating anatase powder in a NaOH aqueous solution. The TiNTs were subsequently doped with nitrogen via an ion exchange process using different concentrations of NH4NO3 (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0\u00a0mol\u00a0L\u22121) as the nitrogen source. After the ion-exchange process, the samples were calcined at 200 and 400\u00a0\u00b0C, which produced nitrogen-doped titanate nanotubes (NTiNTs) and nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanotubes (NTiO2NTs), respectively. All of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and various spectroscopic techniques. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was used to identify and quantify the defects created in the nanotube structures from doping and the calcination process. Our analysis revealed that the number of defects in the NTiO2NTs depended on the nominal NH4NO3 concentration, which formed paramagnetic NO species and single electron-trapped oxygen vacancies (SETOVs). As proof of this concept, the nanotubes were used as photocatalysts with visible light for the degradation of methylene blue (MB). The degradation rate significantly improved depending on the NH4NO3 concentration when the NTiO2NTs were used as the photocatalyst.",

All these MOFs are active in promoting cyanosilylation, but for styrene oxidation, only the Co and Mn MOFs are active while the others behave as initiators rather than catalysts.

Radical mechanisms were proposed for the styrene oxidation over CPO-27-Mn, which yields styrene oxide, benzaldehyde and a minor amount of phenylacetaldehyde. The cyanosilylation over CPO-27-Mn shows size selectivity towards aldehyde substrates, and the catalyst can be recycled without losing its structural integrity and catalytic activity.

     "abstract": "Conversion of alcohols in a gas phase under N2 flow at 573\u00a0K was carried out using V2O3 and MoO2 oxides with low valence oxidation states. It was found in the reaction of ethanol that equimolar amounts of ethane and acetaldehyde were catalytically formed as the main products over the oxides. Bi-products were small amounts of ethene and C4 compounds. Reactions of other alcohols (methanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol) over the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts also led to the equimolar formation of corresponding alkanes and aldehydes or ketone. It was confirmed by XRD and XPS that the low valence states of V2O3 and MoO2 were unchanged during the reactions and the oxides stably worked as the catalyst. Based on catalytic reaction results obtained under various reaction conditions (reaction temperature, contact time, introduction of H2 and C2H4 into reaction stream) and on experiments of kinetic isotope effects on the ethanol reaction, a reaction scheme is proposed, in which hydrogen transfer reaction between two alcohol molecules adsorbed on metal\u2013O2\u2212\u2013metal sites on the surface of V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts takes place via 6-membered transition state, followed by dehydration.",

For that purpose, different intermediates C4H7 and C4H8 radical species were evaluated according to the Horiuti\u2013Polanyi mechanism performed in two sequential steps. The whole process was found to be exothermic on Pd/Ni(1\u00a01\u00a01) and endothermic on Pd3/Ni(1\u00a01\u00a01). Furthermore, the former surface, where the intermediate adsorptions are more favorable, exhibits lower activation barriers than Pd3/Ni(1\u00a01\u00a01). On both surfaces, the B13R formation is associated with high transition state energies through the pathways studied here; for this reason, it is extremely improbable to obtain B13R.

Preparation of the introduced nanofibers is achieved by calcination of electrospun nanofibers composed of nickel acetate, cobalt acetate and poly(vinyl alcohol) in argon atmosphere. The catalytic activity of cobalt enhances the carbonization of the utilized polymer which results in producing nickel/cobalt alloys nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers.

Interestingly it was proofed that, compared to nanoparticles, the nanofibrous morphology has a distinct positive influence on the electrocatalytic activity due to the effect of the one dimensional structure which facilitates the electrons transfer and consequently decreases the IR drop. The introduced nanofibers showed good stability because of the alloy structure.

Ideally, immobilized catalysts combine the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Porous supports such as silica result in optimal recyclability, however, the catalytic reactions are slowed down by pore diffusion. Here, non-porous zirconium phosphate nanoplatelets (ZrP) are used as support material to bridge the gap between homogeneous and immobilized catalysts. ZrP nanoplatelets provide sufficient outside surface area, while still being easily separable from the reaction mixtures. First, a phosphine linker containing an ethoxysilyl group, (EtO)3Si(CH2)3PPh2 (1), is reacted with ZrP to give the phosphine-modified 1i. Addition of Wilkinson's catalyst ClRh(PPh3)3 to 1i gives, via ligand exchange, the immobilized catalyst 1i\u2013Rh. In the absence of pore diffusion the catalytic hydrogenation of 1-dodecene using 1i\u2013Rh proceeds with unprecedented speed and the catalyst can be recovered and recycled 15 times. In the course of the catalytic reaction the mononuclear species forms catalytically active Rh nanoparticles on the surface. Finally it is demonstrated that ClRh(PPh3)3 can be bound to ZrP directly without linker. However, the catalytic activity of the resulting material ZrP\u2013Rh does not quite match the favorable characteristics of 1i\u2013Rh.",

     "abstract": "A reverse-phase microemulsion process was used to prepare PbS quantum dots (PbS QDs) sensitized flower-like Bi2WO6. The PbS QDs possessed average diameters of 10\u00a0nm, and were tightly adhered to the surface of the Bi2WO6, as evidenced by characterization of the structure and composition of the resulting composite. The introduction of PbS QDs greatly improved the photocatalytic activity of the Bi2WO6, and the 3% PbS QDs-Bi2WO6 composites exhibited the highest photodegradation efficiency, with almost 97% of Rhodamine B (RhB) degraded after visible light irradiation for 120\u00a0min. The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the unique quantum effects of the PbS QDs, where both the utilization ratio of visible light was enhanced, and the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers at the intimately contacted interface was increased, as confirmed by the results of photoluminescence spectroscopy. Experiments using radical scavengers indicated that ?O2\u2212 and photogenerated holes were the main reactive species. On the basis of experimental and theoretical results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism for organic pollutant degradation over PbS-Bi2WO6 photocatalysts was proposed.",

     "abstract": "The present work describes the application of sodium (Na-) and hydrogen (H-) titanate nanotubes (TiNTs) as catalysts in oxidation reactions with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. By applying a combination of characterization techniques, it is shown that the interaction of TiNTs with H2O2 leads to a modification in the color and vibrational structure of the TNT, which can be attributed to the formation of superoxide radicals. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements reveal that fraction of generated radicals increases asymptotically with H2O2 concentration. Catalytic tests of methylene blue discoloration revealed that TiNTs are very active in the discoloration of the dye, being the catalytic activity dependent on the concentration of H2O2. The analysis of the reaction products by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry showed that the dye was successively oxidized in different intermediate compounds. The effects of previous thermal treatment of the TiNTs were also investigated, and it was found that the active catalytic sites are progressively deactivated as the treatment temperature is increased. The overall results suggest that terminal groups present in the titanate structure, such as TiO:\u2212 are active catalytic sites that convert into highly reactive superoxide radicals upon interaction with H2O2 molecules.",

It is found that the La-substituted catalysts are more active than the one without La for soot combustion and NOx storage. Among all the catalysts CMALax, CMALa10 (x\u00a0=\u00a010) exhibits the highest catalytic performance, showing the largest NOx storage capacity (300\u00a0\u03bcmol/g) and the lowest temperature for the maximal soot oxidation rate (Tm\u00a0=\u00a0388\u00a0\u00b0C). The results of H2-TPR and O2-TPD indicate that the La-substitution can enhance the redox properties and increase the amount of surface lattice oxygen species of the catalysts.

These catalysts were prepared by Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O calcined at different temperatures. The objects were to determine the catalytic efficiency toward the oxidation-removal of SO2 and NOX in relation to the calcination temperature. 100% SO2 removal is achieved in all conditions, but NOX removal increases with the calcination temperature rising. SEM and TEM analyses indicated that the pellet-type particles containing hematite were firstly formed on the surface of large aggregates, and then peeled off from the surface layer by layer as the calciantion temperature increased from 100 to 300\u00a0\u00b0C. This separating process led to the increase of specific surface areas and the transformation from iron composition to hematite, thus benefiting the catalytic removal efficiency. At higher temperatures (>300\u00a0\u00b0C), the iron nitrate was gradually melted, dramatically reducing the specific surface areas. However, higher calcination temperature benefits the generation of oxygen vacancies, which had a more apparent promotional effect on the catalytic efficiency.

The surface-functionalized AC catalysts were used for the transfer reduction of nitrobenzene, styrene, and 3-nitrostyrene by hydrazine hydrate. The reduction of nitrobenzene and 3-nitrostyrene was promoted over the oxygen- and nitrogen-doped catalysts compared to the parent AC catalyst. Those were less active for the reduction of styrene but active for the reduction of vinyl group of 3-nitrostyrene. However, the nitrogen dopant suppressed the reduction of vinyl group of 3-vinylaniline. The functionalized AC catalysts are likely to facilitate the adsorption and activation of nitro group of the nitro substrates through interactions with polarized surface induced by the oxygen and nitrogen hetero dopants. This should make it possible to reduce the vinyl group of 3-nitrostyrene on the surface. The nitrogen dopant hindered the reduction of the vinyl group of 3-vinylaniline because the adsorption through its amino group should become difficult on the surface of basic nature induced by the nitrogen doping. The AC serves as an electrical conductor and its performance should be enhanced by the surface functionalization and this would contribute to the formation of reducing species such as diimide and proton from hydrazine on the surface. The present results show that oxygen- and/or nitrogen-doped, functionalized carbon materials could be promising as metal-free multi-task catalysts.",

Two types of rehydration methods such as mechanical stirring method and sonication assisted method were employed for rehydration of hydrotalcite. Structure of hydrotalcite was successfully recovered to a layered double hydroxide structure via two rehydration processes (Memory effect of hydrotalcite). All rehydrated hydrotalcites (HT_RSX) with a sonication assisted method exhibited a higher fructose yield than rehydrated hydrotalcite (HT_RM) with a vigorous mechanical stirring in this reaction. In consideration of catalytic activity and rehydration time, sonication rather than mechanical stirring played an efficient role to improve catalytic activity of hydrotalcite in this reaction. Characterization results clearly revealed that the enhanced catalytic activity of HT_RSX catalyst was due to its abundant surface weak base sites resulted from a facile vertical breaking and exfoliation of hydrotalcite layers during the sonication assisted rehydration process. Yield for fructose over rehydrated hydrotalcite catalysts showed a tendency to increase with decreasing the crystallite size of catalyst and with increasing the weak base sites of catalyst.

As a result, the higher degradation efficiency can be achieved under acidic condition than under alkaline and neutral conditions for RhB, MO and their mixture dyes. Furthermore, the Ag3PO4 dodecahedrons also show a high visible-light degradation activity for the RhB\u2013MO mixture dye solution, in which the degradation efficiency of MO is significantly superior to that of RhB. This work could be expected to make a big step toward the practical application of photocatalysis technology.",

The selectivity to the desired product was affected by the presence of a complex reaction network involving several kinetically parallel and consecutive reactions, leading to by-products such as diacetonealcohol, diacetoneamine, mesityl oxide, acetonine, and 2,2,4,6-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydropyridine. The latter was the most undesired by-product, since its formation was irreversible. Key elements in achieving high selectivity in the direct synthesis of triacetonamine were the molar feed ratio between acetone and ammonia, and the amount of water in the reaction medium; in fact, water was found to play an important role in the transformation of the intermediate acetonine into triacetonamine. Compared with homogeneous catalysis, the selectivity achieved by the use of the heterogeneous H-Y zeolites was controlled by means of a proper selection of the zeolite features. In fact, the use of a highly hydrophilic H-Y zeolite made it possible to achieve the same selectivity as that obtained under homogeneous catalysis conditions, with the additional advantage of using an easily separable and reusable catalyst, which showed no deactivation.",

Homogeneous counterparts, MoO2VIN and WO2VIN, as well as randomly ligand-grafted heterogeneous analogues, MoO2VIG and WO2VIG, were also prepared for comparison. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), pair distribution function (PDF) and UV\u2013vis data demonstrate that MoO2VIT and WO2VIT adopt a more solution-like bis(8-quinolinol) coordination environment than MoO2VIG and WO2VIG, respectively. Correspondingly, the templated MoVI and WVI catalysts show superior performances to their randomly grafted counterparts and neat analogues in the epoxidation of cyclooctene. It is found that the representative MoO2VIT-10% catalyst can be recycled up to five times without significant loss of reactivity, and heterogeneity test confirms the high stability of MoO2VIT-10% catalyst against leaching of active species into solution. The homogeneity of the discrete bis(8-quinolinol) metal spheres templated on SBA-15 should be responsible for the superior performances.",

The results of previous calculations found that isolated NDMA adsorbs on the Ni surface in two different competitive ways as the two most stable configurations. In the upright configuration the adsorption is via the ON end. This configuration is slightly preferred energetically to the flat configuration, in which the interaction is via the ONN plane. However, this last configuration leads to a facile dissociation of the NDMA molecule via the NN bond. In the present article, it is found that the formation of dimethylamine (DMA) and NO on the surface is preferred to the formation of other products on the surface from the flat configuration in the low NDMA coverage regime. Hydrogen is needed for the DMA formation. Besides that, high coverage of adsorbed hydrogen decreases the activation energy needed to break the NN bond in the flat adsorption configuration.",

Reactions were studied under microwave and conventional modes of heating and reaction conditions were optimized by varying mole ratio, temperature, amount of catalyst and reaction time. Under optimized conditions the reaction was carried out involving p-cresol and decanoic acid. The reaction involved two steps, O-acylation involving ester formation followed by the Fries rearrangement involving C-acylation resulting in ketone product. Microwave heating mode showed higher conversion and the catalytic activity almost retained in repeated use. On the other hand the catalytic activity dropped by more than 50% in the case of conventional heating indicating rapid deactivation. A change in the color of the used catalyst was more intense in the case of conventional than in the microwave heating. Used catalysts were characterized for surface area and pore volume by BET technique, acidity by FTIR spectroscopy and amount of coke by TGA. Further investigations on the catalyst used in conventional heating revealed that the deactivation occurred during the O-acylation and not in the subsequent Fries rearrangement. However, the catalyst in the microwave irradiated reaction, exhibited a retarded rate of formation of coke precursors on the surface during O-acylation, thus preventing any decrease in catalytic activity. Present study indicates that the technique chosen for heating the reaction medium plays an important role in suppressing deactivation.",

It has been found that several parameters contribute to furfural hydrogenolysis, including alcohol dehydrogenation activity, solvent properties, as well as side reactions such as etherification between the intermediate, furfuryl alcohol, and the hydrogen donor. Methyl furan yield increases from 0 to 68% at 180\u00a0\u00b0C following the order of 2-methyl-2-butanol\u00a0<\u00a0tert-butanol\u00a0<\u00a0ethanol\u00a0<\u00a01-propanol\u00a0\u223c\u00a01-butanol\u00a0<\u00a02-propanol\u00a0<\u00a02-butanol\u00a0\u223c\u00a02-pentanol, which correlates well with the alcohol dehydrogenation activity. In ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol and 2-pentanol, furfuryl alcohol hydrogenolysis to methyl furan is significantly retarded at low temperatures due to furfuryl alcohol etherification with the corresponding alcohol solvent.

The catalysts were prepared by impregnation method and characterized by TEM, XRD, XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies. ND was found a better carrier than carbon nanotubes (CNTS) for MoOx dispersion. The MoOx species are two-dimensional polymerized MoOx which get covalently bonded onto the ND surface via MoOC bonds. A major portion of Mo6+ species was found, together with a small amount of Mo4+ species. Adding 1\u00a0wt% MoOx on ND (1Mo) can increase both propane conversion and propene selectivity, whereas excess MoOx leads to a drastically decrease in propene selectivity due to the aggregation of the MoOx species and the coverage of the active sites of ND. Both ND and 1MoOx/ND catalysts show good stability after a few hours of testing. A sp3\u2013sp2 hybrid structure is formed in situ and the ketonic/diketonic carbonyl groups are generated during the reaction, which are believed to be favourable to the reaction.

The effect of the modifier concentration on the enantioselectivity (ee) and the conversion level in the hydrogenation reaction shows a relationship between the activity and ee as well as the CD concentration. The volcano-type curve observed for each catalyst suggests competitive adsorption of the modifier and substrate on the catalyst surface. The metal loading influences both the Rh crystallite size and catalytic behaviour. An increase in the Rh levels was accompanied by a parallel increase in both the crystallite size and number of Rh ensembles with a subsequent enhancement in both the conversion level and ee. The catalyst with the highest metal loading was 1.0\u00a0wt% Rh/MCM-41, and it displayed the highest ee among the catalysts studied.

     "abstract": "Nitrogen doped TiO2 (TiO2\u2212xNx), one of the most promising visible-light photocatalytic materials, exhibits a low photocatalytic activity owing to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, which is caused by the isolated energy level of N 2p formed above the valence band of TiO2. To reduce the recombination of photogenerated charges and further improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2\u2212xNx, in this study, Fe(III) cocatalyst was loaded on the surface of TiO2\u2212xNx photocatalyst by a simple impregnation method. It was found that after surface modification by Fe(III) cocatalyst, the photocatalytic performance of all the TiO2\u2212xNx photocatalysts could be greatly improved for the decomposition of MO under visible-light irradiation. Especially, the Fe(III)/TiO1.981N0.019 photocatalyst showed the highest photocatalytic activity and its rate constant k was ca. 52.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0min\u22121, which is higher than that of the corresponding TiO1.981N0.019 photocatalyst (9.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0min\u22121) by a factor of 5.3 times. Based on the present experimental results, the Fe(III) was thought to be an effective cocatalyst to significantly improve the electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2\u2212xNx to the adsorbed oxygen, thus facilitating the rapid separation of photogenerated charges and greatly enhancing the photocatalytic activity. In addition, the direct interfacial charge transfer from the N 2p isolated energy level to Fe(III) cocatalyst can also contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2\u2212xNx. Considering the abundant Fe resources and its low cost, the Fe(III)-cocatalyst modification can be regarded as an effective approach for rational design and development of high-performance visible-light photocatalysts in practical applications.",

Highly dispersed Ti species were obtained on Ti\u2013MS\u2013X supports, which were beneficial to improve the dispersion of the cobalt species impregnated subsequently.

The strong Co\u2013SiO2 interaction in Co/MS catalyst was effectively weakened due to the existence of Ti\u2013O\u2013Si structure in the catalysts promoted by low Ti loading. The reduction degree of cobalt species was therefore enhanced and the FTS activity was improved simultaneously. Moreover, the electron density of metallic cobalt was increased with the addition of TiO2 due to partial electrons transfer from support to Co via the Ti\u2013O\u2013Si structure, which affected the product distribution of FTS reaction. In the catalysts containing high Ti loading, the interaction between cobalt and Ti\u2013MS\u2013X supports was strengthened due to the agglomeration of TiO2, because of the strong interaction between cobalt and TiO2.

Diffuse reflectance UV\u2013visible and Fourier transform intra-red spectroscopy, together with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to probe the effect of nitrogen on the vanadia-titanium dioxide interaction. The band gap edge energies obtained for the vanadium oxide species suggest that the size of the vanadia cluster is larger on the nitrogen doped catalysts compared to the ones observed in the N-free support, pointing to a weaker interaction between vanadia and TiO2 when nitrogen is present. At the same time and in-situ Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy studies indicate that interstitial N exists in the catalyst surface in forms of hyponitrite or nitrite-like species. A model in which nitrogen affects vanadia dispersion and ethanol adsorption capacity is proposed to explain all these observations.",

Transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) revealed that the thickness of TiO2 layers was linearly dependent on the TBT content, producing predictable results. As the ratio of TBT (mL) to TEOS (mL) increased, the purity of the TiO2 layers of the prepared MSTs increased owing to the absence of Si compounds. Based on TEM-EDS, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, TiO2 in MSTs was successfully coated on the surface of amorphous SiO2 with Fe3O4 as the core. Magnetization of the MSTs declined exponentially with increasing thickness of the non-magnetic SiO2\u2013TiO2 layer. The optimal loading and activation energy of MSTs were also determined for photocatalytic removal of IBP. Comparison of the kinetic constants suggests a positive relationship between photocatalytic activity and surface area. Increased aggregation of the MSTs with higher magnetization values was attributed to stronger magnetic dipole\u2013dipole interactions. The results of this study provide an in-depth understanding of the synthesis of magnetically separable catalysts satisfying the requirements of both magnetic separation and photocatalytic activity with potential application in the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants.",

Enhanced activity over the combustion synthesized catalyst wherein Cu2+ ion is present as substitutional ion in ceria has been attributed to Cu\u2013O\u2013Ce ionic interaction.

A discussion is presented concerning the known chemical mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed delignification by white-rot fungi. Biomimetic and bioinspired synthetic metalloporphines show monooxygenase/peroxygenase-like catalytic activity, being quite more versatile catalysts than ligninolytic enzymes (being capable only of one-electron oxidations). The advantages of this behavior are encompassed with an in-depth discussion about the molecular aspects of their action mechanisms, the possible oxygen donors, and the known oxidizable substrates.

     "abstract": "The catalytic conversion of m-cresol in the presence of H2 has been investigated on SiO2-supported Ni, Fe, and bimetallic Ni\u2013Fe catalysts at 300\u00a0\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure. Over the monometallic Ni catalyst, the dominant product is 3-methylcyclohexanone while 3-methylcyclohexanol and toluene appear in smaller amounts, even at high conversions. By contrast, on Fe and Ni\u2013Fe bimetallic catalysts, the dominant product is toluene while the hydrogenation products (3-methylcyclohexanone and 3-methylcyclohexanol) are practically negligible in the entire range of conversions.To explain these differences, we have proposed a deoxygenation path that starts with the tautomerization of m-cresol to an unstable ketone intermediate (3-methyl-3,5-cyclohexadienone). The fate of this intermediate is determined by the ability of the catalyst to either hydrogenate the carbonyl group or the ring. The former would mostly occur on Fe and Ni\u2013Fe catalysts that contain an oxophilic metal (Fe), while the latter would occur on Ni, which has a higher affinity for the aromatic ring.Hydrogenation of the carbonyl group produces a very reactive unsaturated alcohol (3-methyl-3,5-cyclohexadienol), which can be easily dehydrated to toluene. This would explain the high selectivity of Fe and Ni\u2013Fe to toluene. By contrast, hydrogenation of the ring would result in 3-methylcyclohexanone, which can be further hydrogenated to 3-methylcyclohexanol. On supports that contain acid sites, which are active for dehydration, the formation of toluene would occur via dehydration of the alcohol and subsequent dehydrogenation. On the catalysts investigated in this work, dehydration of the corresponding alcohol does not occur, so the only path to toluene is via hydrogenation of the carbonyl of the unstable ketone intermediate.In addition, to the products mentioned above, xylenol is also observed in significant yields, which indicate that transalkylation of m-cresol is another reaction path occurring on these catalysts.",

The selectivity to acetol strongly depended on the Sn/Ni ratios, which reached the highest value of 53.9% at the ratio of 0.5, compared at similar cellulose conversions (\u223c20%). On Ni-SnOx/Al2O3 (Sn/Ni\u00a0=\u00a00.5), cellulose, glucose and fructose converted to acetol in high yields of approximately 35%, 53% and 73%, respectively, at 210\u00a0\u00b0C and 6\u00a0MPa H2. The effects of the Sn/Ni ratios on the acetol selectivity appear to be related to their effects on the hydrogenation activity of the Ni-SnOx/Al2O3 catalysts that decreased with increase of the Sn/Ni ratios, and to the relative rate between the hydrogenation of C6 sugar intermediates (e.g. glucose and fructose) and their degradation intermediates (e.g. glyceraldeyde and dihydroxyacetone) involved in the cellulose reaction on the Ni particles and the isomerization of glucose to fructose and their CC bond cleavage by retro-aldol condensation on the SnOx domains. Comparison of SnOx with CeOx, ZnOx and AlOx supported on Al2O3 with different basicity suggested that the larger concentration of stronger basic sites on SnOx facilitated the isomerizaiton of glucose to fructose and its subsequent CC bond cleavage. These results and their understanding provide guidance for improving the acetol production from cellulose by tuning the catalytic functions required for the involved reactions of hydrogenation on the metal surfaces, and isomerization and CC bond cleavage on the basic sites.",

The prepared materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, elemental analysis, nitrogen physisorption and 29Si CP MAS NMR. Special focus was on evaluating the influence of the structural modification of the mesoporous catalysts on their stability under the conditions of catalytic conversion of carbohydrates. In aqueous medium all catalysts show very low activity and HMF selectivity. However, when the reaction is carried out in DMSO, HMF yields of up to 88% can be achieved with a minimum amount of sulfonic acid-modified catalyst. Among the materials tested, the hybrid organosilica-based catalyst shows the highest dehydration rate. It is demonstrated that pure silica-based catalysts degrade strongly under the catalytic conditions. The hydrothermal stability of the mesoporous catalysts is improved in the presence of organic moieties in their structure.

This reaction is used, in a cascade process, together with a hydrogenation and dehydration catalyst to obtain hydrocarbons in the kerosene range from hexose-derived valeric acid. It is shown that zirconium oxide is a very selective and stable catalyst for this process and when combined with platinum supported on alumina, the oxygen content was reduced to almost zero. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that alumina is superior to active carbon, silica, or zirconium oxide as support for the hydrogenation/dehydration/hydrogenation sequence and a palladium-based catalyst deactivated more rapidly than the platinum catalyst. Hence, under optimized reaction conditions valeric acid is converted into n-nonane with 80% selectivity (together with a 10% of C10\u2013C15 hydrocarbons) in the organic liquid phase upto a 100:1 feed to catalyst ratio [w/w].

The sulfonated carbon materials were utilized as catalysts for pretreatment of acid oils (oils containing 8.17\u201343.73\u00a0wt% of free fatty acids). The catalysts could be used to convert free fatty acids (FFA) present in acid oils into corresponding methyl esters within 6\u20138\u00a0h at 80\u00a0\u00b0C, thus reducing the FFA content to desirable levels below 2\u00a0wt%. The esterification activity was found to be dependent on the initial FFA concentration found in the acid oil as well as methanol-to-oil molar ratio. High methanol-to-oil molar ratios and the presence of higher initial FFA concentrations resulted in enhanced esterification rates. Acid oil containing 43.7\u00a0wt% FFA was easily converted into mixtures containing up to 71% methyl esters (FAME). The reported catalyst was successfully recycled in five consecutive experiments and exhibited high thermal stability. Most importantly, the catalytic activity of the solid acid was found to outperform homogeneous case when equivalent amount of H2SO4 under similar conditions was applied. Therefore, the OCW derived sulfonated carbon catalyst reported herein could be used as a potential substitute for corrosive, concentrated H2SO4 currently employed for acid oil pretreatment.",

While characterizing this mixture via EXAFS, it was thus surprising to observe an unexpected change in the color of the reaction mixture from deep blue to yellow or orange. Subsequent characterization of the reaction via UV\u2013vis and EXAFS showed that the color change was due to the oxidation of bromide to dibromine. The reaction was found to require the presence of dioxygen. It was found via MALDI, IR and other methods, that the commercial source of cobalt(II) acetate contained a small amount of nitrate impurity. It is the presence of nitrate that caused the oxidation of bromide since intentional addition of various nitrate compounds causes the reaction to occur. Nitrate is likely initiating a chain reaction. The dibromine formed is an active bromination agent. Thus we show that an inexpensive, in-situ preparatory method for generating dibromine is a Mn(II) acetate/nitrate/bromide/air mixture. We show that the reaction, for T\u00a0<\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C, is autocatalytic and its initiation and reaction times are dependent on a number of variables such as temperature, nitrate concentration, type of bromide and metal, pH, water concentration in acetic acid, and purity of the solvent. A cautionary note: the accidental addition of nitrate into a catalyst feed tank used for homogeneous oxidation of alkylaromatics in pilot plants or commercial plants could cause the bromide to oxidize to dibromine. This could be potentially dangerous and/or result in decreased yields.",

The obtained composites were well characterized with the aid of various techniques to study their morphological, physical, optical, and photo-chemical properties. Photocatalytic capacities of the pure BiVO4 dumbbells and BiVO4/RGO composites have been evaluated by investigating the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB)-contained wastewater under natural sunlight irradiation, where a noticeable augmentation in the natural-sunlight-driven decolorization efficiency (approx. 26% increase compared with that of pure BiVO4) of RhB could be achieved on the prepared BiVO4/RGO composites under experimentally optimum conditions.

     "abstract": "In recent years, several works have been addressed to decrease carbon dioxide emission or to capture, to storage and to use it. An attractive option is its use as feedstock of chemical industry, especially in dehydrogenation reactions (such as ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to produce styrene), providing an exothermic process which can be operated at lower temperatures, making negligible the cracking products. Aiming to find alternative catalysts for this reaction, magnesia-supported iron oxides were studied, being prepared by two different methods. The classical impregnation produced a spinel (MgFe2O4) co-existing with magnesia containing Fe3+ species, this catalyst showing higher specific surface area and being more active and selective than magnesia. Moreover, the deposition of iron nanoparticles through a magnetic fluid on magnesia produced magnesia-supported hematite nanoparticles co-existing with magnesia containing Fe3+ species. In this case, the specific surface area and the activity were even higher and the solid is much more reducible than the other sample. These findings were associated to hematite nanoparticles and to the lower tendency of iron species to diffuse into magnesia lattice. They show that the Fe3+ species are more active and selective to styrene as hematite nanoparticles than when they are in the environment of magnesium ferrite.",

The kinetics of the catalytic oxidation of thiosulfate (S2O32\u2212) has been studied spectrophotometrically as a function of [RuIII(edta)], [H2O2], [S2O32\u2212] and pH. Spectral analyses and kinetic data indicate a catalytic pathway involving activation of both substrate (S2O32\u2212) and oxidant (H2O2). Substrate activation pathway involves the formation of a red [RuIII(edta)(S2O3)]3\u2212 species through the reaction of the [RuIII(edta)(H2O)]\u2212 catalyst complex and the substrate (S2O32\u2212). Hydrogen peroxide reacts directly with thiosulfate coordinated to the RuIII(edta) complex to yield sulfite as immediate oxidation product. Peroxide activation pathway is governed by the formation of [RuV(edta)(O)]\u2212 catalytic intermediate which oxidize thiosulfate, however, at slower rate ( k ox 2 = 0.012 M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) as compared to the rate of oxidation of the coordinated thiosulfate ( k ox 1 = 0.93 M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C).

As the NCy/NS molar ratio in the feed decreased, the Zr content in the supported catalyst and ethylene homopolymerization activity increased owing to the strong interaction between NS and (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2, whereas dual-silane functionalized catalysts showed little difference as regards the activity of ethylene-1-hexene copolymerization. The molecular weight (MW), polydispersity index (PDI) and chemical compositional distribution (CCD) were significantly influenced by the composition of the two silanes in feed. The MW of the homo- and copolymers increased as the molar ratio of NCy/NS in the supported catalyst increased. The presence of NCy in the supported catalyst made the PDI and MW narrower and larger, respectively. NCy was found to have a tendency to form more homogeneous active sites during the grafting process compared to the NS. Therefore, a change in the NCy/NS molar ratio can control the MW and PDI of the resulting polyethylene. From the results of a TREF analysis, it was also found that the nature of active species grafted onto the amine groups can be controlled by the type of amine group and by the NCy/NS molar ratio on the surface of SBA-15.

This complex combined with another Cl\u2212 jointly assists the break of CO bond of propylene oxide (PO), which is the rate-determining step for the coupling reaction, and the corresponding barrier (28.0\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) is effectively lowered in comparison with the reaction promoted only by ZnCl2 (65.9\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) or [BMIM]Cl (33.1\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121).

Thermal stability and catalytic activity of PdCl2(XnPy)2 complexes without steric hindrance increases with increasing XnPy's basicity whereas a decrease of thermal stability and catalytic activity of the complexes is observed for sterically crowded complexes (with the ortho-substituted XnPy). The complexes with X\u00a0=\u00a0Cl in meta- position of XnPy decompose to a mixture of PdCl2 and metallic Pd (similarly to complexes with MenPy) whereas complexes with ortho-chlorine (in XnPy) decompose to the organopalladium products. Therefore, two different mechanisms of thermal decomposition are proposed for PdCl2(ClnPy)2 and PdCl2(MenPy)2. The results of complex thermal and structural analysis of a series of PdCl2(XnPy)2 complexes allow us to get insight into the mechanism of nitrobenzene (NB) carbonylation catalyzed by PdCl2(XnPy)2 at 150\u2013180\u00a0\u00b0C. We conclude that the electron transfer from Pd(0) to nitrobenzene is the rate determining step of catalytic cycle of NB carbonylation.",

This uses nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)2) and low cost triphenylphosphine (TPP) in the presence of the coordinating solvent tri-n-octylamine (TOA) to form Ni2P/MCM-41 catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2-adsorption specific surface area measurements (BET), CO uptake, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effects of the synthesis temperature, and initial P/Ni molar ratio on the formation of the Ni2P phase were studied. The formation of the crystalline phase follows the order Ni\u00a0<\u00a0Ni12P5\u00a0<\u00a0Ni2P with increasing synthesis temperature. The high initial P/Ni molar ratio favored the formation and dispersion of the Ni2P phase, and a mixture of the Ni12P5 and Ni2P phases was observed in the sample with the low initial P/Ni molar ratio of 0.5. The dibenzothiophene (DBT) hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity increased with reaction temperature in all cases. The catalysts synthesized at 603\u00a0K with an initial P/Ni molar ratio of 6 exhibited good DBT HDS activity. The DBT conversion was close to 100% at 613\u00a0K, which was much higher than that of the catalyst prepared by the conventional temperature programmed reduction (TPR) method (DBT conversion 43%). During the HDS reaction, the superficial phosphosulfide phase NixPySz was formed on the surface of the catalyst; this showed higher activity than Ni2P.",

The results of the catalytic tests in ethanol conversion in the presence of steam on unsupported Ni NPs at 523\u00a0K show already an ethanol conversion higher than 90% together with high yields in methane, CO and H2. These NPs actually behave as very active ethanol decomposition catalysts, in these conditions. Increasing the reaction temperature (673\u00a0K) they convert into good steam reforming catalysts. On the other hand, the conventional alumina-supported Ni catalyst is poorly active in dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde below 673\u00a0K, but behaves as a good steam reforming catalyst at this temperature. In CO2 methanation at 773\u00a0K the best catalytic activity was obtained on 125% Ni/Al2O3, while Ni NPs result poorly active in catalysing this reaction. The characterization of the exhaust materials shows: (i) hexagonal Ni particles on both catalysts after ethanol conversion in the presence of steam, (ii) cubic nickel particles on both samples after methanation of CO2.

These Q3FeIII complexes were found to be active for the oxygenation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone by aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in acetonitrile under heating conditions. Among the Q3FeIII complexes examined, the 5-chlorinated 1b and the unsubstituted 1a showed a good accelerating effect on this oxygenation due to their good ability to activate H2O2, as supported by DFT B3LYP/6-311G (d) calculation and TGA characterization. Notably, the above-described catalysis reactions were accelerated to some extent under visible light irradiation, providing an equivalent to a slightly higher cyclohexane conversion with a similar product distribution compared to the corresponding thermal catalysis reactions.

CO2-TPD measurements of Ba-doped rare earth oxides revealed that Ba species supported on rare earth oxides with moderate strength of basic sites, such as Dy2O3, Sm2O3 and Y2O3, can be highly dispersed on the surface of support oxide, suggesting that highly dispersed Ba species acts as catalytically active sites for NO decomposition. Although the formation of nitrite (NO2\u2212) species during NO decomposition reaction over Ba-Dy2O3 and Ba-La2O3 was confirmed by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy, NO-TPD measurements suggested that the formation of N2 does not occur by the decomposition of adsorbed NOx species. Isotopic transient kinetic analysis performed using 14NO and 15NO revealed that the surface reaction of adsorbed species, probably NO2\u2212, as an intermediate with other NOx adspecies is a key step for the formation of N2.

The polymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and high temperature 13C NMR spectroscopy and proved to be LLDPE with ethyl, butyl as well as longer branches. The branching degrees were tuned efficiently from 4.6 to 39.3/1000C by different reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, Fe/Ti molar ratio and Al/(Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Ti) molar ratio.

It is observed that the addition of BaO promotes the catalytic oxidation of propene over Pt/Al2O3, while sulfation results in the deactivation of Pt/Al2O3. The good activity of Pt/BaO/Al2O3 is ascribed to the weakened propene adsorption, the formation of reactive enolic species and easy oxidation of intermediate CO by active oxygen at Pt\u2013Ba interface.

High desulfurization efficiency of dibenzothiophene (DBT) could be obtained not only in hydrophilic ionic liquid (IL) [Bmim]BF4 (94.9%) but also in hydrophobic IL [Omim]BF4 (97.2%) by using ChFeCl4 as a catalyst under mild conditions. ESR measurements could give the evidence that the active oxygen species generated by ChFeCl4 and H2O2 in IL were involved in the catalytic oxidation of DBT. The influential factors, including reaction time, temperature, catalyst dosage, and O/S (H2O2/DBT) molar ratio, were investigated in detail to estimate the optimal conditions for the desulfurization system in [Omim]BF4. The aromatic sulfur compounds, DBT, benzothiophene (BT), and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT), could be oxidized to the corresponding sulfones, which were detected by GC\u2013MS. Moreover, the catalytic system containing IL and catalyst could be easily separated from oil and could be recycled at least five times without a significant decrease on removal of DBT.",

The oxidation of ethylbenzene and cyclohexene to acetophenone and 2-cyclohexene-1-one using N-hydroxyphthalimide (2-Hydroxy-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione; NHPI) under oxygen atmosphere in the presence of a SiO2/Al2O3-supported manganese catalyst occurs with conversions of 95 and 99% and selectivities of 99%.

     "abstract": "Three different alumina-supported catalysts were prepared according to 3 different methods, aiming at achieving fine deposition of gold particles. In methods 1 and 2, (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and (3-mercaptopropyl)triethoxysilane (MPTES) were respectively used as anchoring agents. In method 3, the gold particles were directly deposited on the support without using any anchoring agent. The performances of the so-obtained catalysts were evaluated in the reaction of glycerol partial oxidation in the liquid phase, and compared to those of a 1\u00a0wt.% Au/Al2O3 catalyst provided by Mintek. The best catalyst A3 (method 3) exhibited a 99% conversion at 60\u00a0\u030aC after 2.5\u00a0h, with glyceric and glycolic acids selectivities of 60 and 20%, respectively. These performances were slightly higher than those of the reference commercial catalyst (95% conversion with glyceric and glycolic acids selectivities of 62 and 20%, respectively). In the case of A2 catalyst (method 2), in spite of very good dispersion of small nanoparticles on the surface, which is normally supposed to yield very active materials, a very strong inhibition of glycerol conversion was observed. After 2.5\u00a0h of process at 60\u00a0\u030aC, the glycerol conversion did not exceed 4%. A similar behavior was also observed for TiO2- and ZnO-supported catalysts, prepared in the same manner (using MPTES). In order to get a better understanding of the parameters ruling the reactivity of the various catalytic systems, a series of experiments over the commercial catalyst was performed, in which small quantities of various sulphur derivatives and antioxidants were used in the reaction mixture to simulate the response of the various species that can be present in the lab-prepared samples (method 2). The results, together with XPS analysis, suggests that there are three possible interpretations of the observed inhibition effect: (i) a strong interaction between gold and sulphur leading to the formation of covalent AuS bonds on nanoparticle's surface; (ii) the formation of so-called SAM's (self-assembled monolayers) blocking access to surface active centers; or (iii) an inhibition of the reactivity due to antioxidation properties of S-derivatives.",

The role of Al, its amount, acidity of the catalyst, effect of reaction conditions (especially presence of solvent and excess air) and amines nature on the oxidative coupling reactions were investigated. Surface OH groups play an effective role in amine activation by hydrogen bonding, whereas the acid sites generated by incorporation of optimum amount of Al further improve the activity. The Al in optimum amount (Si/Al: 20) showed good catalytic activity in self coupling of benzyl amine as compared to MS and Al-MS with high Al loading. A suitable polar solvent and presence of excess air significantly promote the activity of MS and Al-MS for amine coupling reactions. The MS without Al was also found to be efficient catalyst for oxidative self and cross coupling of amines. The presence of Al in Al-MS (in optimum amount, i.e., Si/Al: 20) made the self coupling of benzyl amine faster than MS, whereas the cross coupling reactions with Al-MS were observed to be slightly slower than MS, which is probably due to competitive adsorption of amine substrate and amine nucleophile over acidic sites. The activity of MS and Al-MS catalysts for self and cross coupling reactions was also dependent of the amines nature (basicity and nucleophilicity).",

The physicochemical characterization of the calcined and reduced samples was carried out by: N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms, N2O titration, XRD, XPS, TPR and DRFTS of CO adsorption. It was observed that the increase of Cu content leads to decrease of the apparent copper metal dispersion caused by the strong agglomeration of the metal particles. The selectivity to different reaction products was connected with the electronic properties of the catalysts defined by the copper particle size and the interface at metal-oxide support. The highest selectivity to ethyl acetate over samples with Cu content \u226510\u00a0wt.% was assigned to the high density of basic sites of O2\u2212 ions and more heterogeneous distribution of copper species (Cu0/Cu+) defined by DRIFTS of CO adsorption and XPS.",

Degradation of AO7 was employed to evaluate the catalytic activity of the pretreated ceria samples in the presence of H2O2 in pre-adsorbed mode (AO7 pre-adsorbed on CeO2 before the addition of H2O2) and pre-mixed mode (CeO2 pre-mixed with H2O2 before the addition of AO7). Two sulfated ceria samples (H2SO4\u2013CeO2 and Na2SO4\u2013CeO2) exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in both modes compared with un-pretreated bare CeO2. XRD, BET, FTIR and potentiometric titration methods were used to characterize the pretreated ceria samples. The sulfated samples display stronger surface acidity due to the sulfate ions anchored on their surface. Raman and XPS measurements were carried out to analyze the samples after reacting with H2O2. A mechanism to explain the improved catalytic activity of sulfated CeO2 is proposed that the active surface peroxide species (Ce(III)O2H\u2212), which are excessive due to the over-complexation of H2O2 with surface Ce3+ sites, can be decomposed into high-active hydroxyl radicals under surface acidic environment.",

In this study a series of supported nano-Pd/\u03b1-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared and applied to the selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. The preparation procedure consisted of two steps: synthesis of colloidal Pd nanoparticles by a reduction-by-solvent method, followed by impregnation onto \u03b1-Al2O3. In the first step, NaBH4 was used as a reducing agent to reduce Pd2+ ions in the C2H5OH/H2O solvent system, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used as a protecting agent to stabilize Pd nanoparticles. The prepared colloids and catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, CO chemisorption, XRD, UV\u2013vis, FT-IR, ICP and HRTEM techniques. It was found that the amounts of NaBH4, C2H5OH and PVP had effects on the Pd particle size, which in turn influenced the catalyst performance. The selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene was sensitive to the structure of the nano-Pd/\u03b1-Al2O3 catalysts. In the case where the Pd particle size varied from 3.8 to 6.6\u00a0nm, the specific activity and the selectivity to styrene increased with increasing particle size, but when the particle size increased in the range of 6.6\u201312.1\u00a0nm, the specific activity increased slowly and the selectivity to styrene decreased gradually. Nano-Pd/\u03b1-Al2O3 can be reused several times without loss of activity and selectivity and no distinct variation in the Pd particle size was observed, indicating its good stability in the selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene.",

The TPD spectra recorded upon ethanol exposure on Ni-Co layers with different Ni:Co composition (Ni atomic fraction\u00a0=\u00a00, 0.37, 0.54, 0.64, 1) show several desorption products as a result of ethanol dehydrogenation and decomposition reactions. XPS results revealed that the Ni-Co thin layer agglomerated upon annealing, while evidence of oxygen spillover from the ZnO support to the NiCo overlayer was found. Chemisorbed ethanol readily reacts with the model catalysts and desorbs as C2H4O (243\u00a0K), CH4 (243\u00a0K), H2 (258\u00a0K), CO (312\u00a0K and 440\u00a0K) and CO2 (at 363\u00a0K). Ethanol decomposition and desorption of methane is more favorable on Ni rich NiCo layers. On the other hand, dehydrogenation of ethanol and production of acetaldehyde is more pronounced on cobalt. In addition, mobile oxygen from the ZnO support participates to the oxidation of carbonaceous species at higher temperatures, preventing carbon deposition.

Precipitates obtained through adding NaOH solution into Ti(SO4)2 were peptized with HNO3, followed by calcination at varying temperatures to form SO42\u2212/TiO2. The objective of the present work is to clarify the effect of calcination temperature on the structure and surface properties of SO42\u2212/TiO2. A variety of characterization techniques, involving X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller analysis (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), and electron spin resonance (ESR), were employed in this study. XRD revealed that well-crystallized titania was formed upon calcination at 300\u00a0\u00b0C (SO42\u2212/TiO2-300). Owing to the stabilization effect of sulfate, SO42\u2212/TiO2-300 exhibited small crystalline size and high surface area, which can account for its superior photocatalytic performance. Catalyst calcination at 600\u00a0\u00b0C (SO42\u2212/TiO2-600) rendered rapid growth of crystalline size and drop of surface area. Meanwhile, such high-temperature calcination treatment gave rise to Ti3+ defects and oxygen vacancies. Although the photoactivity of SO42\u2212/TiO2-600 was remarkably reduced as compared with SO42\u2212/TiO2-300, it was still higher than that of Degussa P25 due very likely to the formation of Ti3+-oxygen vacancies-Ti3+ sites that are beneficial for the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes.",

     "abstract": "Usually, cocatalyst modification and nanonization of photocatalytic materials have been demonstrated to be two kinds of effective strategies to improve the photocatalytic performance. For the well-known Ag/AgCl photocatalyst, it is difficult to obtain AgCl nanoparticles by a conventional precipitation reaction in aqueous solutions. It is highly required to develop a facile and effective strategy to simultaneously realize the cocatalyst modification and nanonization of Ag/AgCl photocatalysts. In this study, cocatalyst modification and nanonization of Ag/AgCl photocatalyst were simultaneously realized via a facile reduction\u2013reoxidization route by using graphene oxide (GO) as the cocatalyst modifier. It was found that the chemical reduction of both Ag+ and GO by NaBH4 leaded to the formation of nanoscale Ag grafted on the reduced GO (rGO), whereas the following in situ reoxidization of metallic Ag in FeCl3 solution resulted in the final formation of well-dispersed Ag/AgCl nanoparticles on the rGO surface. Owing to a good encapsulation of Ag nanoparticles by rGO nanosheets, the resultant AgCl nanoparticles could be easily controlled to be 20\u2013200\u00a0nm and were tightly grafted on the rGO cocatalyst surface. The photocatalytic experimental results indicated that all the Ag/AgCl-rGO (1\u20135\u00a0wt% rGO) nanocomposites exhibited a much higher photocatalytic decomposition of phenol than the Ag/AgCl under visible light irradiation, and the Ag/AgCl-rGO (3\u00a0wt% rGO) showed the highest performance. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Ag/AgCl-rGO can be attributed to the cooperation effect of rGO nanosheet cocatalyst promoting the effective transfer of photogenerated electrons, and the nanonization of AgCl particles that provide more surface active sites for the decomposition of organic substances. This work may provide new insights into the fabrication of high-performance visible-light photocatalytic materials.",

In our experiments, when the used support is mesoporous alumina, most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained.

As a result, the oxidative state of Sn can be stabilized and the transformation of active sites is promoted, thus improving the catalytic stability and reaction selectivity.

     "abstract": "The thermal activation of a silica-stabilized \u03b3-alumina impacts positively on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene (ST). A systematic thermal study reveals that the transition from \u03b3-alumina into transitional phases at 1050\u00a0\u00b0C leads to an optimal enhancement of both conversion and selectivity under pseudo-steady state conditions; where active and selective coke have been deposited. The effect is observed in the reaction temperature range of 450\u2013475\u00a0\u00b0C at given operation conditions resulting in the highest ST yield, while at 425\u00a0\u00b0C this effect is lost due to incomplete O2 conversion. The conversion increase is ascribed to the ST selectivity improvement that makes more O2 available for the main ODH reaction. The fresh aluminas and catalytically active carbon deposits on the spent catalysts were characterized by gas adsorption (N2 and Ar), acidity evaluation by NH3-TPD and pyridine adsorption monitored by FTIR, thermal and elemental analyses, solubility in CH2Cl2 and MALDI-TOF to correlate the properties of both phases with the ST selectivity enhancement. Such an increase in selectivity was interpreted by the lower reactivity of the carbon deposits that diminished the COx formation. The site requirements of the optimal catalyst to create the more selective coke is related to the higher density of Lewis sites per surface area, no mixed Si\u2013Al Br\u00f8nsted sites are formed while the acid strength of the formed Lewis sites is relatively weaker than those of the bare alumina.",

The types of the active species (such as OH and O2\u2212) generated in the photocatalytic process are complicated and their roles playing in the photocatalysis remain obscure and controversial. Aimed at these problems, the active species in the degradation process of methyl orange (MO) were investigated by using TiO2 and ZnO photocatalysts. Various surface analysis techniques (NMR, ESR, photoluminescence technique, etc.) were used to study their mechanisms in the degradation of MO under UV light irradiation. As a result, it was found that in TiO2 system, OH was generated by photo-generated holes; while in ZnO system, OH was generated by photo-generated holes and O2\u2212. The larger numbers of the active species and their incessant sources in ZnO system contributed to the better activity. The conclusions were first found in the investigation of the active species between the two catalysts and would provide certain theoretical guidance in seeking the new pathway to increase the concentration of the active species and the photocatalytic activity.",

Catalytic oxidation of the sulfur-containing model oil (methyl phenyl sulfide, dibenzothiophene and thiophene) was also studied under optimized conditions. In both cases, excellent conversion and selectivity were obtained in relatively short reaction times. This novel catalyst showed the characteristic of homogeneous reaction at ambient temperatures and phase-separation at lower temperatures.

They were applied to the hydrogen production by steam reforming of liquefied natural gas (LNG). For reference, a nickel-alumina xerogel catalyst without promoter (NA) was prepared by a single-step epoxide-driven sol\u2013gel method. The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption\u2013desorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TPR, H2-chemisorption, TEM, and CHNS analyses. Surface area and pore volume of M/NA catalysts were smaller than those of NA catalyst due to blockage of mesopores by promoters during the impregnation step. Both NA and M/NA catalysts exhibited X-ray diffraction patterns corresponding to nickel aluminate phase. In the TPR measurements, it was revealed that all the catalysts retained surface nickel aluminate phase, regardless of the identity of alkaline earth metal. Nickel surface area of reduced catalysts decreased in the order of Mg/NA\u00a0>\u00a0Sr/NA\u00a0>\u00a0Ca/NA\u00a0>\u00a0NA\u00a0>\u00a0Ba/NA.

The phase behavior and the effect of CO2 on the conversion of benzonitrile and the yield of benzylamine were discussed. The reaction rate was retarded in solventless, hexane and ethanol, but accelerated in water in the presence of compressed CO2. The decrease in reaction rate was mainly ascribed to the formation of carbamate from benzylamine and the intermediate 1-aminodibenzylamine reacting with CO2, and it precipitated out to coat on the surface of catalyst in solventless and hexane, and the dilution effect of compressed CO2 in ethanol. But the yield of benzylamine was increased in solventless, hexane and ethanol due to the following nucleophilic addition of benzylamine and benzylimine to N-benzylidenebenzylamine was inhibited. Although, the reaction rate increased in water for the enhanced solubility of H2 and benzonitrile in H2O and decreased mass-transfer resistance in the presence of compressed CO2, the yield of benzylamine decreased because of the acidic nature of H2O\u2013CO2 favorites the elimination of NH3 and the formation of NH4HCO3.

The Au nanoparticles play a crucial role in the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and as a consequence Au\u2013Bi2CuO4 nanoparticles can produce more hydroxyl radicals, which have been quantitatively identified by conducting fluorescence experiments with terephthalic acid as a probe molecule.",

Free energy profiles indicate that the first C\u2013H activation step is the rate-determining (RD) step and the transition state (TS) of the propene formation step is the RD\u2013TS. ODP activity can be tuned by vanadia dispersion and support surface via the modification of the electronic structure of the active oxygen sites. For the RD step, on both dimer VOx/TiO2 catalysts terminal sites have higher activity. On monomer VOx/TiO2 (1\u00a00\u00a00) terminal and interface sites exhibit similar activity, while on monomer VOx/TiO2 (0\u00a00\u00a01) interface sites have higher activity.

No phenol was formed in the absence of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites, i.e. on Cu/KZSM5, revealing the bifunctionality of the Cu/HZSM5 zeolite.

It is found that on M(2\u00a01\u00a01) formic acid prefers the O (OC) atom atop adsorption and the H (HO) atom bridging two neighboring metal atoms, and formate prefers the bidentate adsorption with O atoms atop on metal surface.

From the temperature dependence of the rate constants we extracted the Arrhenius parameters and the standard enthalpies of activation for the reactions. In addition, we studied the dynamics of formation of the intermediate species formed during decomposition of H2O2, the HO radical. The kinetic data for H2O2 reactivity and the yields of hydroxyl radical formation differ considerably between many of the materials studied. We compared the energetic and mechanistic data obtained in this work with literature data for a set of nine oxides in total. The Arrhenius pre-exponential factors normalized to surface area for the decomposition of H2O2 vary by nine orders of magnitude for some of the oxides investigated. This indicates that the surfaces of the oxides have very different catalytic capacity towards the decomposition of H2O2. The standard enthalpies of activation for H2O2 decomposition vary between 30 and 73\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121, revealing also differences in the catalytic efficiency for the different materials. The mechanistic study consists of quantifying the HO radical scavenged by tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) during the course of the decomposition of H2O2 for the whole set of oxides. The yields and dynamics of scavenging of HO\u2022 differ considerably between the oxides analyzed. Surprisingly, the time-independent plots of the amount of HO scavenged as a function of the conversion of H2O2 reveals that during the decomposition of H2O2 there are turnover points where the amount of HO scavenged by Tris suffers a sudden increase. The location of these points and the curvatures of the plots at the near-neighbours is considerably different for the different materials.",

Solvent effects on these reactions have been explored by calculations that included a polarizable continuum model (PCM) for the solvent (CH2Cl2). Three possible pathways which lead to forming 1,3-diene, allene or carbenoid intermediate via an unprecedented tandem sequence of [1,3]- and [1,2]-migration of two different migrating groups were proposed. Calculations suggest that the [1,3]-rearrangement is a two-step process with activation free energies below 11.0\u00a0kcal/mol for both steps. The following of [1,2]-migration reaction is also easy with an activation free energy of 20.4\u00a0kcal/mol in CH2Cl2. The next step in the catalytic cycle is a [1,2]-hydride shift, and this step is the rate-limiting step (with a calculated activation free energy of 23.2\u00a0kcal/mol) without water. In the presence of water, the direct [1,2]-hydride shift has been changed into a deprotonation/protonation process with an activation free energy of 9.7\u00a0kcal/mol. The higher activation free energies for the intramolecular 6\u03c0 electrocyclic ring closure process indicate that this step became the rate-determining one. Calculations show that a water-catalyzed [1,2]-hydrogen shift adopts a proton-transport catalysis strategy, in which the acetoxy group in the substrate is critical because it acts as either a proton acceptor when one water molecule or a water cluster is involved in catalysis. Our calculated results are consistent with the experimental observations of Gevorgyan et al. for the gold (I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization of propargylic esters leading to unsymmetrically substituted naphthalenes.",

As a result, the shell coating improved the selectivity to middle distillates with a higher percentage of olefins.",

Here, a full factorial experimental design is performed to demonstrate the catalytic consequences of varying key reaction parameters such as pH, borate to sugar ratio, and reaction time. Reactivity data revealed that isomerization is favored under acidic pH conditions (pH\u00a0<\u00a07.0); that epimerization dominates under neutral conditions (pH ranging from 7.0 to 7.8); and that drastic inhibition of both epimerization and isomerization rates occur under basic conditions (pH\u00a0>\u00a07.8). Using a 5\u00a0wt% arabinose feed and 100:1 sugar\u2013metal ratios at 343\u00a0K, conversions ranging from 20% to 30% were obtained with selectivities of 75%, 84%, and 91% for boron\u2013sugar ratios of 0.2:1, 0.5:1, and 1:1, respectively. The predominance of epimerization over isomerization products with substoichiometric borate suggests that one borate can influence the reactivity of several sugar molecules and may influence the Sn active site directly.

The newly developed Fe0/OA/DO system is more effective in decolorization of MB than its EDTA counterpart, and is of a strong stability in prolonged use. Operating parameters such as pH and OA concentration have significant influence on the decolorization rate for MB in this system, and lower pH value and higher OA concentration are favorable. The low decolorization rate for OII can be dramatically enhanced by introduction of photoirradiation into the system. Coexistence of Cr(VI) has an opposite influence on decolorization of MB and OII in the photo-assisted Fe0/OA/DO system. In the latter case, Cr(VI) promotes the decolorization of OII, and itself can also be reduced, which allows effective simultaneous removal of OII and Cr(VI) from a mixed solution.

The uniquely effective activity of tyrosine for sucrose conversion into 5-HMF in [Emim]Br is mainly attributed to its two types of active sites, free base NH2 and dissociated H+ sites. The former one plays a crucial role in the isomerization of glucose to fructose, and the latter one is active in the hydrolysis of sucrose into monosaccharides and dehydration of generated fructose to 5-HMF. Furthermore, the presence of acidic phenol group in tyrosine also has the synergic catalytic effect on sucrose conversion.

     "abstract": "Complexes [Rh(nbd)(acac)], [Rh(cod)(acac)] and [Rh(cot)(acac)] (nbd\u00a0=\u00a0norborna-2,5-diene, cod\u00a0=\u00a0cycloocta-1,5-diene, cot\u00a0=\u00a0cyclooctatetraene) were investigated as catalysts of polymerization of monosubstituted acetylenes into stereoregular cis-transoid poly(monosubstituted acetylene)s. All complexes (without cocatalyst) are highly active in phenylacetylene (PhA) polymerization in both coordinating (THF) and non-coordinating (CH2Cl2) solvents. [Rh(cot)(acac)] prepared in situ by ligand substitution in [Rh(ethylene)2(acac)] with cot is efficient in PhA polymerization even in systems with a high cot content. Selection of solvent and cycloolefin ligand of the catalyst allows the control over poly(phenylacetylene) molecular weight (Mw\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 to 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105). [Rh(nbd)(acac)] exhibit (moderate) activity also in polymerization of alkylacetylenes (alkyl\u00a0=\u00a0n-butyl, tert-butyl, 4-chlorobutyl, cyclopropyl, yields up to 28%, Mw up to 7.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104) and in copolymerization of alkylacetylenes with arylacetylenes. In situ 1H NMR monitoring of polymerization systems revealed monomer-assisted transformation of [Rh(cycloolefin)(acac)] complexes into precursors of polymerization centres consisting in proton transfer from the monomer to acac ligand of the catalyst under release of acetylacetone. [Rh(cycloolefin)(acac)] catalysts thus differ from the widely used [Rh(nbd)Cl]2 catalyst which is transformed into active centres precursors only in reaction with cocatalyst or a molecule of coordinating solvent and which is efficient only in presence of a proper cocatalyst and/or coordinating solvent.",

The characterization showed that co-doped TiO2 samples have a high degree of crystallinity and existence of fully anatase phase. It was found that all the synthesized catalysts have the mesoporous structure. The co-doped TiO2 samples have larger BET surface areas and the mesopores volume than pure TiO2 and La doped samples. The vanadium co-doping contributes to the extension of absorption into the visible region. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by the decolorization of textile dye Reactive Blue 52 in aqueous solutions under sun-like radiation. Compared with La singly doped TiO2, the co-doped catalysts showed an important improvement of photoactivity. The photocatalyst with 2% (w/w) La and 0.02% (w/w) V appeared to be the most photoactive. Optimal catalyst loading and the kinetics of degradation were also studied.

The CO conversion, selectivity and yield of CH4 on the catalysts were studied for the methanation reaction. It was found that CO conversion increased with temperature rise at first, reached maximum value at sulfidation temperature of 450\u00a0\u00b0C and then decreased sharply with further increase of temperature. The catalyst derived from ATM could get higher CO conversion than the catalyst from AHM because of the structural similarity between ATM and MoS2. XRD analysis demonstrated that amorphous MoS2 was favorable for the methanation reaction and a crystal transition of MoS2 nanoparticle happened during the methanation reaction. The higher the sulfidation temperature was, the more easily regular crystal structure of MoS2 formed. TEM characterization results showed that at the optimum sulfidation temperature of 450\u00a0\u00b0C, the length and stacking degree of MoS2 crystallite were the highest and so more active sites could reside on the edges of MoS2 slabs for CO methanation. The crystal growth of MoS2 particle and its structure change are probably the reasons for the deactivation of the MoS2 catalysts with the increase of sulfidation temperature. In addition, it is the loss of surface sulfur that caused deactivation of the catalyst with reaction time.",

The generation of Ti\u2013O\u2013Ce mixed bond raised the quantity of Lewis acid sites and therefore improved the distribution of the copper oxide species on the catalyst surface. The high SCR activity of the Cu/Ti0.9Ce0.1O2 was mainly attributed to the abundant Lewis acid sites and the high ratio of adsorbed oxygen on the catalyst surface, which provided more adsorption centers for NO and promoted the NO oxidation in the SCR reaction. Furthermore, the high concentration of Cu2+ was beneficial to NO adsorption. Combined with the in situ FT-IR results, it was suggested that the synergistic effect of ceria and copper promoted the formation and reactivity of nitrates, oxygenated hydrocarbons, and key intermediates isocyanate (\u2013NCO species), and consequently, Cu/Ti0.9Ce0.1O2 catalyst exhibited the excellent SCR performance.",

BET surface area analysis of the composites showed surface areas of 170 and 161\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121 for TiO2 and TiO2\u2013RGO composite respectively. TEM images show that the sizes of the particles are around 4\u00a0nm and in the composite clearly show that TiO2 NPs are present on the surface of the graphene sheet. The use of IL2 produces a high crystalline TiO2 NPs with pure anatase phase without need of thermal treatment (TT). Hydrogen generation by UV light on TiO2 NPs or TiO2\u2013RGO composite prepared in ILs without thermal treatment (TT) show lower rate than TiO2 P25.

The resulting materials were characterized using ultraviolet diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and photoluminescence (PL) techniques. The results indicate that a change in band gap energy (Eg) as a function of N-doping level in the materials resulted in a change in the valence band (VB) level, but not the conduction band (CB) level. The very small upward shift in VB enhanced the photocatalytic formation of OH radicals produced by irradiation with visible light. In addition, the small amount N-dopant (up to 3\u00a0at%) incorporated into the samples accelerated the evolution of O2, rather than the formation of OH species. The incorporation of larger amounts of N-dopant in the TiO2\u2212xNx reduced the rates of both O2 evolution and OH formation, due to the small energy level of VB and the short life time of the photo-generated charges. The performance of TiO1.97N0.03 nanoparticles with an Eg value of 2.8\u00a0eV was outstanding for the evolution of O2 from the water under the experimental conditions used.",

It was proposed that the oxygen vacancy in Ce1\u2212xZrxO2 played an important role in the catalysis by determining concentration and mobility of the adsorbed COx on the catalyst.

Alley, I.K. Hamdemir, K.A. Johnson, R.G. Finke, J. Mol. Catal.: A Chem. 315 (2010) 1\u201327). The key question addressed in the present paper is \u201cWhat is the nature of the AlEt3-derived stabilizer species?\u201d for the unusually stable and active Ziegler-nanoparticles formed from [Ir(1,5-COD)(\u03bc-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3. Specifically tested herein are four primary hypotheses for the AlEt3-derived stabilizer(s) in the Ir(0)n Ziegler-nanoparticle system: (i) that the key stabilizer is neutral (i.e., uncharged) aluminum alkyl carboxylates following precedent from the work of Shmidt and B\u00f6nnemann; (ii) that the key stabilizer is anionic [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]\u2212; (iii) that a key stabilizer is the AlEt3 (or its derivatives) reacting with the Ir(0)n nanoparticle surface; or (iv) that an important AlEt3-derived stabilizer is AlOAl containing alkylalumoxanes formed from any water present. The results obtained rule out (ii), but provide strong evidence for (iii), as well as evidence consistent with (i) and (iv), as stabilizers in Ziegler-nanoparticles. A pictorial scheme (Scheme 2) is provided as a working hypothesis for the stabilization mode(s) of Ziegler-nanoparticles and as a way to focus and expedite the needed additional composition and structural studies of Ziegler-nanoparticle stabilizers.",

It was found that the loaded platinum was mainly exchanged and dispersed on the apatite surface, forming particles with an average size of 2\u00a0nm. The exchanged platinum, as shown by XRD, did not affect the apatite structure or its crystallinity. The specific surface area of the bare CaHAp as well as the mean pore diameter, diminished by increasing the Pt loading, probably because the pores were partially blocked. The Pt(x)/CaHAp samples calcined at 500\u00a0\u00b0C contained, beside the exchanged platinum, Pt and PtO. H2-TPR results showed that the platinum occupied on the apatite at least two different sites.The acid\u2013base and redox properties of the catalysts were studied using, as the probe reaction, butan-2-ol conversion. The impregnation of CaHAp with Pt decreased its natural basic properties and enhanced markedly the dehydrogenation of butan-2-ol into methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). In the presence of air, the production of MEK increased abruptly with the temperature. The reaction started at 30\u00a0\u00b0C, passed through a maximum (90% of conversion) at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and then it decreased rapidly. This important activity at low temperatures was attributed to Pt and Pt2+ species associated with the basic Ca2+\u2013O2\u2212 groups of the apatite.The synthesized bifunctional catalysts were also investigated in the acetone conversion, in one step, into methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). The optimal performance was achieved with the sample loaded with 0.5\u00a0wt.% Pt. It displayed at 150\u00a0\u00b0C and stationary state a MIBK yield of 23% with a selectivity of 74%.

The graphite felt support was first derivatized by cathodic reduction of 4-carboxymethyl-benzenediazonium salts. Complexes with different chains were then covalently immobilized on the functionalized porous support by esterification reaction. The successful achievement of the immobilization process is attested by the presence of the CuII/I reversible system in cyclic voltammetry. Volume concentrations around 10\u22128\u00a0mol\u00a0cm\u22123 of immobilized catalysts are estimated by integration of the redox peak. Comparison of the catecholase activity of the immobilized complexes allows to conclude on the effect of the chain nature and length. First, high chain length positively influences the catalytic activity. Second, the presence of oxygen atoms in the linker significantly enhances the catecholase activity of the catalyst. A possible explanation is the chain hydrophilicity, making easier the access of the catalytic center by H2O molecules.",

C-modification of supported Pd particles induced persistent hydrogenation activity at low temperatures (220\u2013260\u00a0K). C-modification of the Pd(1\u00a01\u00a01) surface, in contrast, did not result in significant reactivity changes. At low temperatures (220\u2013260\u00a0K), hydrogenation activity was only maintained over the C-modified Pd particles, while at temperatures (\u2265280\u00a0K) persistent hydrogenation was observed over all Pd catalysts at comparable rates. Two principal reaction mechanisms are discussed that could be responsible for the observed hydrogenation activity at different Pd surfaces. We show that on Pd nanoparticles, the reaction mechanism involving subsurface hydrogen species plays an important role under all investigated conditions. This subsurface-related reaction pathway relies on an effective replenishment of the subsurface hydrogen reservoir, which is affected by the presence of strongly adsorbed hydrocarbon species that are formed in the induction period. We discuss the correlation between the induction times and the hydrogenation activity of different Pd surfaces.",

Also, N2 adsorption, transient response experiments, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and in situ FT-IR spectroscopy were performed to investigate the deactivation mechanism of MnOx/MWCNTs catalyst in the presence of H2O or SO2. Experimental results showed that H2O had a reversible negative effect on the catalytic activity of the catalyst. When the temperature was higher than 270\u00a0\u00b0C, the effect of H2O could be negligible. The competitive adsorption of H2O and NH3 on the Lewis acid sites contributed to the deactivation of the catalyst. The integrity increase of MWCNTs in the presence of H2O might be another reason for the deactivation of the catalyst. However, SO2 led to the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. The higher the reaction temperature, the more dramatically the catalystic activity decreased. The sulfation of the active center atoms was the main poisoning route. Also, formation of ammonium sulfates on the catalyst surface and the competitive adsorption between SO2 and NO were responsible for the partial deactivation of the catalyst to some extent.",

With Ru-BINAP dissolved in the ionic liquids 3-hydroxypropylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide on silica 100, stable catalyst performance could be obtained for more than 50\u00a0h time-on-stream. At 95\u00a0\u00b0C and with a residence time in the reactor of less than 3\u00a0s a stable product yield of 80\u201384% was obtained with moderate but stable enantiomeric excess of 26\u201330%.",

Structural studies show metal ion substituted ceria as the predominant phase. The hydrogenation over PdRuC2 is completed beyond 75\u00a0min with 100% selectivity. Conversely, PdC2 hydrogenates ~40% of p-chloronitrobenzene with 82% selectivity. Increase of temperature from 35\u00a0\u00b0C to 80\u00a0\u00b0C showed a little higher activity of PdRuC2 but with a lower selectivity. The as-prepared and aged forms of PdRuC2 showed similar activity, whereas PdRuC2 heat-treated at 500\u00a0\u00b0C increased the conversion and the 800\u00a0\u00b0C heated catalyst reduced it (both ~2%) indicating high thermal stability. Maximum hydrogenation activity has been observed in ethanol as compared to methanol and butanol. The PdRuC2 catalyst also shows excellent hydrogenation activity towards o-, m-chloronitrobenzene and nitrobenzene. The enhancement of activity and selectivity of Pd in presence of Ru in the PdRu bimetal ionic catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction has been attributed to involvement of remarkable Ru4+-promotion in Pd0.01Ru0.01Ce0.98O2\u2212\u03b4.",

     "abstract": "A new application of silyl peroxides as oxidants in the Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidation of cyclic ketones in chloroaluminate(III) ionic liquids is described. Among the silyl peroxides, the reactivity of two groups of peroxides was studied: bis(silyl) and t-butyl silyl peroxides possessing different structured substituents attached to the Si atom. It was shown that the acidic 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloroaluminate(III) ionic liquid (molar ratio of AlCl3 in ionic liquid: 0.67) present in the oxidation of cyclic ketones with bis(silyl) peroxides acts as the catalyst. In this variant of the reaction, the reactivities of bis(silyl) peroxides decrease in the following order: bis(trimethylsilyl) peroxide\u00a0>\u00a0bis(vinyldimethylsilyl) peroxide\u00a0>\u00a0bis(phenyldimethylsilyl) peroxide\u00a0>\u00a0bis(diphenylmethylsilyl) peroxide. A variety of cyclic ketones such as cyclobutanone, 3-substituted cyclobutanones, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, 2-methylcyclohexanone, 4-methylcyclohexanone, 2-adamantanone and norcamphor were oxidised to their corresponding lactones with high yields (49\u2013100%). When t-butyl silyl peroxides and neutral chloroaluminate(III) ionic liquids (molar ratio of AlCl3 in ionic liquid: 0.5) were utilised in the Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidation, the studied ionic liquid acted as the reagent. Here, phenyldimethyl(t-butylperoxy)silane was the most efficient oxidant in the oxidation of cyclobutanone to \u03b3-butyrolactone (70% yield). Other peroxides, including trimethyl(t-butylperoxy)silane, vinyldimethyl(t-butylperoxy)silane and diphenylmethyl-(t-butylperoxy)silane, were less reactive oxidants.

The radical peroxide is the direct oxidant of the amine-catalyzed epoxidation. The calculation gives the transitional structures and activation barriers of ethylene epoxidation carried out by the two oxygen atoms of pyrrolidine N,N-dioxo-radical. The barriers are 11.9 and 9.6\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that the N,N-dioxo-radical has a strong epoxidation activity. If the secondary amine catalyst is chiral, the oxidant structure can lead to the enantioselectivity of the epoxidation. It is often easy for the amine-catalyzed epoxidation to produce a large amount of diol. This is because the N,N-dioxo-radical is easily protonated by HCO3\u2212 and the protonated radical peroxide oxidizes olefin into diol. Pyridine can suppress the formation of diols because it can suppress the protonation of N,N-dioxo-radical.

     "abstract": "The degradation of Alizarin Red S (ARS) was carried out by heterogeneous advanced photo Fenton processes (HAPFP) of the type Fe0/H2O2/UV and heterogeneous modified photo Fenton process (HMPFP) of the type Fe0/ammonium persulfate (APS)/UV. The influence of various reaction parameters like pH, catalyst loading, concentration of the oxidants and the influence of inorganic anions such as Chloride (Cl\u2212) and Sulfate (SO42\u2212) ions on processes were investigated. Quenching of the hydroxyl radical by inorganic anions was confirmed by the decrease in the degradation rate constant for the HAPFP from 3.33\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122 to 0.19\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122 (for Cl\u2212 (1\u00a0M)) and 0.29\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0min\u22121 (for SO42\u2212 (1\u00a0M)). Similar decrease in rate constant for HMPFP is from 4.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122 to 0.41\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122(for Cl\u2212 (1\u00a0M)) and 0.51\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0min\u22121 (for SO42\u2212 (1\u00a0M)) process. The combined effect of concentration of sulfate and chloride ions on the rate constant for the degradation of ARS with APS and H2O2 as oxidants is investigated. The initial degradation mechanism involves the cleavage of a quinone group to catechol as detected by UV\u2013visible and GC\u2013MS analysis.",

     "abstract": "Highly dispersed, nanosized ruthenium (Ru) particles anchored on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with varying Ru loadings (1\u20137\u00a0wt.%) showed effective catalytic activity in the aerobic oxidation of p-cymene using molecular oxygen. The activity of the Ru catalysts was influenced by the structural properties that resulted from the different metal loadings and by various reaction variables, such as the temperature, the amount of catalyst and the type of radical\u2013initiator substrate. Under optimized reaction conditions, the 3%Ru/CNF catalyst exhibited excellent performance with a selectivity of 42% toward primary cymene hydroperoxide (PCHP) and 33% toward tertiary cymene hydroperoxide (TCHP) at 55% p-cymene conversion achieved within 5\u00a0h at 90\u00a0\u00b0C. The results demonstrated that the direct participation of the catalyst in p-cymene CH bond activation occurred via catalytic decomposition of tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), which was added as an initiator, into a free-radical chain initiator rather than the direct H-atom abstraction by the catalyst itself. The catalytic efficacy displayed by the Ru/CNF catalysts provides encouraging results for the activation of CH bonds of liquid-phase alkyl aromatic hydrocarbons, such as p-cymene, toward the introduction of an oxygen atom. The catalyst was reusable for five consecutive reaction cycles without appreciable loss of activity. Moreover, Ru/CNF catalyst was active for extended substrate scope application in the oxidation of other alkyl-substituted aromatics.",

Here we report the structural characterization of degradation products from the photocatalysis of microcystin-LR (MC-LR). To achieve efficient photocatalytic degradation of MC-LR, we fabricated highly ordered TiO2 nanotubes using anodization method. The surface morphology of TiO2 nanotubes depends primarily on the anodic voltage and the optimum value is 20\u00a0V. Under UV irradiation, the concentration of MC-LR decreases by 84.6% when using TiO2 nanotubes anodized at 20\u00a0V within 30\u00a0min. The degradation intermediates of MC-LR are detected with mass spectrometry (MS) and seven main intermediates are observed in liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) chromatogram. We propose the possible structures of the intermediates of MC-LR and infer its possible degradation pathways. The results indicate that the conjugated double bond and methoxy group in the Adda chain, as well as the conjugated system in the Mdha amino acid, are susceptible to be initially attacked by hydroxyl radicals. In addition, it is deduced that the peptides undergo breakdown from Mdha, then their carboxyl and amino groups are stepwise hydrolyzed and the side chain of the amino acid is oxidized.",

The results show that the catalytic performance of MoO3/SiO2 for the epoxidation of propylene with cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) is affected by pH value of precipitant, and MoO3/SiO2 prepared with precipitant of pH 9 exhibits the highest yield of propylene oxide (PO). It has been found that the weak Lewis acidic sites on MoO3/SiO2 are the active sites of the propylene epoxidation with CHP, total amount of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface is related with the CHP conversion, and the weaker Lewis acid sites is in favor of the propylene epoxidation. When the amount of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface is more and their acid strength is higher, the CHP degradation and PO acid-catalytic hydrolysis would be speeded up, resulting in a reduction of the PO selectivity. The concentration and strength of the Lewis acid sites on MoO3/SiO2 are affected by pH of precipitant, and the catalyst prepared with precipitant of pH 9.0 possesses the most weakly Lewis acidic sites and the highest selectivity to PO (91.5%). Besides, the addition of certain amount of Nd can increase the weakly acidic sites to enhance CHP conversion and reduce the Lewis acidity of the catalyst thus suppress PO hydrolysis.",

Reduced (Cu0.08,Zn0.92)O mixed oxide accumulates 6H/Cu, mainly as hydride, hydroxyl and formate species. The reduction of copper in the (Cu,Zn)O mixed oxide occurs via a reversible redox interaction with H2 and absorption of protons as OH\u2212-groups with \u03bd\u00a0=\u00a03250\u00a0cm\u22121 and \u03b4\u00a0\u2248\u00a01430\u20131480\u00a0cm\u22121.

The weight loss during the reduction is due to the decomposition of the residual carbonate groups to CO2 via formate intermediates, which occurs in the presence of hydrogen. Exposure of (Cu,Zn)O to air prior to the reduction strongly affects the kinetic parameters of the reduction process.",

The ligands were subsequently converted to the iron complexes [Fe(10)2](OTf)2, [Fe(11)2](OTf)2, [Fe(12)(OTf)2] and [Fe(16)(OTf)](OTf), which were obtained as tan powders in 90\u201394% yield and characterized by various instrumental techniques. Preliminary screening experiments revealed that all complexes are catalytically active in the oxidation of secondary alcohols and benzylic methylene groups to the corresponding ketones. Optimization experiments with the complex [Fe(12)(OTf)2] yielded a system that provided under mild condition ketones from benzylic methylene groups and secondary alcohols in 63\u201390% isolated yields (3\u00a0mol% catalyst loading, 3\u00a0equiv.

Similar conditions utilizing environmentally friendly acetone as the solvent and 4\u00a0equiv. tBuOOH resulted in 36\u201365% isolated yields for some of the substrates, indicating a somewhat lower catalytic activity in that solvent. For the complexes [Fe(10)2](OTf)2 (two tridentate ligands), [Fe(12)(OTf)2] (one tetradentate ligand) and [Fe(16)(OTf)](OTf) (one pentadentate ligand), the product formation for a test reaction was followed over time at significantly reduced catalyst loading to determine activities. Under these conditions, the complex [Fe(10)2](OTf)2 exhibited a somewhat lower catalytic activity compared to the other two complexes. Thus, the denticity seems to have an impact on catalytic activity although it is not dramatic, and a higher denticity appears to be beneficial for catalysis.",

The results revealed that the physicochemical properties of the films, such as BET surface area, porosity, crystallite size and pore size distribution, could be controlled by adjusting the calcination temperature.

DRS showed that as-prepared CNTiO2 films exhibited higher absorption in the visible light region and a red shift in the band gap transition due to CN-doping.

In particular, the film calcined at 400\u00a0\u00b0C showed high mechanical stability during three consecutive cycles for MC-LR degradation.

Significant variations in product distribution and catalytic activity were observed when the exchange degree of mordenite changed. As revealed by NH3-TPD and 1H MAS NMR results, the acid site density and distribution over the catalysts were directly related to the degree of ion-exchange of sodium in mordenite. The change of support acidity led to different anchoring modes and dispersion of Mo species on the support which further resulted in the different reduction behavior of Mo species under olefin atmosphere. A good correlation between product distribution and properties of the catalysts was proposed.",

In this work, P25-, anatase- or rutile-supported copper oxide catalysts (signed as CuO/P25, CuO/A and CuO/R) were prepared and characterized to study the titania support effect on the physicochemical properties and catalytic properties for the trace CH4 combustion. It is found that the activity of CuO/R is better than the corresponding CuO/A sample when their pore size and specific surface area are comparable, which is attributed to the different chemical states of the copper oxide caused by the different TiO2 support polymorphs. The loading of CuO and subsequent calcination promotes more significant sintering and anatase to rutile transform for CuO/P25 than those for CuO/A. Thus, CuO/R shows better stability than CuO/P25.",

The hydrogenated NR and PIP were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). A low degree of hydrogenation (HD) was observed when using RhCl3/PPh3 or RhCl3/TPPTS. In contrast, a high HD of 85.8% was achieved by using RhCl3/TPPMS. The catalytic behavior could be well explained by the Hartley ionic spherical micelle model. The HD increased with increasing catalyst amount, reaction temperature and H2 pressure. The catalyst activity of RhCl3/TPPMS for NR hydrogenation was found to be lower than that for PIP hydrogenation for all conditions due to impurities in the latex, including protein. The hydrogenated NR (86%HD) has high thermal stability with a maximum decomposition temperature of 466\u00a0\u00b0C and a glass transition temperature of \u221260\u00a0\u00b0C.

Relaxation lifetime of photoexcited electron\u2013hole pairs is measured to be 20, 24 and 116\u00a0\u03bcs for CdS nanosphere, shorter and longer CdS nanorod, respectively, seems to be responsible for the observed fluctuation in photoluminescence and photocatalytic activity. The photooxidation rate of salicylic acid (0.5\u00a0mM) and photoreduction of p-nitrophenol (0.2\u00a0mM) are significantly improved with increasing dimensions of CdS nanorods despite having a comparable surface area (81 and 76\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121) and CdS nanospheres (18\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121) exhibit poor photocatalysis. The better delocalization of charge species along the radial as well as longitudinal dimensions of CdS nanorods, higher crystallinity and delayed recombination time facilitate electrons or holes for active participation in the photoinduced reactions, and Au deposition always displayed superior photoactivity.",

     "abstract": "The widespread occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the environment has prompted great concern due to their potential impacts on wildlife and humans. The degradation of two of the most commonly detected PhACs, carbamazepine (CBZ) and ibuprofen (IBP), was investigated by a nano-magnetite (Fe3O4) heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction in aqueous suspensions of nano-Fe3O4 in the absence and presence of montmorillonite clay. Experimental design and response surface methodology (RSM) were applied to evaluate the effects of important factors. The results showed that hydroxyl radical (OH) formation by the heterogeneous decomposition of H2O2 on the Fe3O4 nanoparticle surface (OHss) plays the dominant role in CBZ and IBP degradation at neutral pH. The degradation of CBZ and IBP followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the degradation rate constants (k) in aqueous suspensions were 0.182 and 0.121\u00a0h\u22121, respectively. In addition, significant adsorption of CBZ to the montmorillonite clay occurs at neutral pH, while IBP is not adsorbed, due to electrostatic repulsion. As a result, an inhibition effect of adsorption on the degradation of CBZ (kCBZ\u00a0=\u00a00.127\u00a0h\u22121) in clay slurry was observed, but not for IBP degradation (kIBP\u00a0=\u00a00.202\u00a0h\u22121). The major intermediates, identified by solid phase extraction (SPE) followed LC\u2013MS analysis, included hydroxy-CBZs, dihydroxy-CBZs, CBZ-10,11-diol, and hydroxy-CBZ-10,11-diols in CBZ degradation; and hydroxy-IBPs, dihydroxy-IBPs, trihydroxy-IBPs, tetrahydroxy-IBPs, 4-isobutylacetophenone and 1-(4-isobutylphenyl)ethanol in IBP degradation.

     "abstract": "The effects of various anions containing copper based catalysts were studied in regard to the preparation of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) through oxidative carbonylation of methanol under a liquid phase system. A copper compound providing the strong withdrawing power of halides as anion yielded excellent results with respect to the conversion of methanol and selectivity to DMC.However, copper homogenous catalysts suffer from separation of the catalyst after reaction. Thus, the development of a new reaction system using various supports including Y-zeolite was attempted. The conversion of methanol and selectivity to DMC were affected by the properties of the supports. In particular, Y-zeolite showed the best yield among various supports.The influence of various promoters was examined with the aim of increasing the yield of DMC from methanol. The yield of DMC was increased with the addition of alkali metal in the order Li+\u00a0<\u00a0Na+\u00a0<\u00a0K+, but with selectivity in the order of Li+\u00a0>\u00a0Na+\u00a0>\u00a0K+, respectively.Various analyses were conducted in order to elucidate these results. From a XRD analysis, the existence of crystal forms of copper chloride hydroxide of Cu/Na/Y-zeolite (dry) was observed. We confirmed the presence of peaks of CuO in Cu/Na/Y-zeolite (550\u00a0\u00b0C). The CO-TPD analysis revealed that CO desorption is an important step to determine the formation of DMC. The addition of NaOH as a co-catalyst resulted in a lower desorption temperature of carbon monoxide in Cu catalyst. Also, XPS analysis results showed that Cu+ on the calcined Cu/Na/Y-zeolite catalyst was formed by the reduction of Cu2+.

With the introduction of Zn into Ru(0\u00a00\u00a00\u00a01) at high H surface coverage, the adsorption energies of the intermediates are much lower than those on bare Ru(0\u00a00\u00a00\u00a01), which indicates that the desorption of cyclohexene is promoted on the alloyed surface.

N2 adsorption\u2013desorption results showed that the pretreatment atmosphere had a negligible effect on the physical structure of all catalysts. Interestingly, it was found that different pretreatment atmosphere (Ar, O2) and Ag loading exhibited a large difference on the structure of silver catalyst and their catalytic activity. For Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with low silver loading (\u22646\u00a0wt%), Ar pretreatment resulted in the highest activity for CO oxidation. However, the highest catalytic performance was observed after oxygen pretreatment over the silver catalyst with high loading (>6\u00a0wt%). UV\u2013vis and H2-TPR results showed Ar pretreatment and Ag loading strongly affected the states of Ag species for the silver catalysts, which were changed from metal Ag (\u22644\u00a0wt%) to a mixture of Ag and Ag2O (\u22656\u00a0wt%). Moreover Ar pretreatment was favorable for the formation of small Ag particles for Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with low Ag loading. When the silver loading is increased, the heavy aggregation of silver particles occurred after Ar pretreatment, resulting in the decrease of TOF for CO oxidation. O2 pretreatment was conductive to the formation of subsurface oxygen species on the larger silver particles for Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with high Ag loading, which resulted in the increase of TOF for CO oxidation. It was evident that small metal Ag particles was key factor of the higher catalytic activity for Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with low Ag loading, while a large number of subsurface oxygen species played an important effect on the higher catalytic activity for Ag/SBA-15 catalyst with high Ag loading.",

The solid with the Mn/Mg\u00a0=\u00a01 ratio is the most active and selective catalyst and shows more activity than the oxide obtained by the co-precipitation method. The redox behavior in the manganese catalysts depends on the preparation method, which, in the case of auto-combustion, avoids the segregation of phases. The manganese reacts faster than the cobalt with the glycine and produces oxides with better properties in oxidation reactions.

The photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller surface area. The results showed that photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst was much higher than that of pure g-C3N4 via photodegradation of Rhodamine B under visible light irradiation. The kinetic constant of RhB degradation over ZnO(15\u00a0wt.%)/g-C3N4 was 3.1 times that of pure g-C3N4. Effect of ZnO content on the photocatalytic activity of ZnO/g-C3N4 was studied in detail. The active species in RhB degradation were examined by adding a series of scavengers. The study on photocatalytic mechanism revealed that the electrons injected directly from the conduction band of g-C3N4 to that of ZnO, resulting in the production of O2\u2212 and OH radicals in the conduction band of ZnO. Simultaneously, the rich holes in the valence band of g-C3N4 oxidized Rhodamine B directly to promote the photocatalytic degradation reaction. This work may provide some insight into solving the unsatisfactory catalytic activity and low efficiency converting solar radiation for practical applications of g-C3N4.",

It was found that the novel catalysts show the high catalytic activity in the hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) of rac-epichlorohydrin in the medium of THF, TBME, CH2Cl2 and CH3CN. tert-Butyl methyl ether appeared to be the best medium for performing the resolution. An effect of the nature of the polymer matrices on activity of the supported catalysts was also observed. The activity could be improved by optimization of HEMA concentration in the mixture of the monomers and by selection of the cross-linker. The most active catalyst was prepared based on the HEMA resin derived form 30\u00a0mol.% of HEMA and diethylene glycol dimethacrylate as a cross-linker. In the presence of this catalyst the HKR could be performed even at 0.01\u00a0mol.% concentration of Co(III) ions. The catalysts could be recycled 10th time at 0.5\u00a0mol.% concentration without any additional reactivation. It allowed conducting the HKR of epichlorohydrin within less than 60\u00a0min even in the 10th cycle. The catalyst with the highest loading of catalytic centers could be also used successfully for conducting the HKR of epichlorohydrin in solvent-free conditions.

We present a binding mode in which one terminal phosphoryl oxygen atom as well as the nucleophilic group (hydroxyl anion) binds to zinc center.

Both the concerted reaction pathway and stepwise reaction pathway are SN2 manner of nucleophilic substitution reactions. Meanwhile polar protic solvents like water, methanol and ethanol are favored in the catalyst-assisted hydrolysis mechanism.

The oxidation of CO is used as a model reaction case to test for catalytic activity. Importantly, the type of TiO2 phase present has an effect on the physical, chemical, and catalytic properties of the CuO catalysts. The rutile phase of the TiO2 support (CuO/R) interacts weakly with the CuO and TiO2 support. Cu2+ ions in the supported-CuO are readily reduced to Cu0 during the CO oxidation reaction. Consequently, CuO/R provides large amounts of oxygen atoms for reaction with CO, which results in the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts examined.

Ni catalysts have been prepared from nickel(II) citrate in order to favour the formation of highly dispersed Ni particles. Ni2P based systems have been prepared from a phosphite-type precursor, Ni(HPO3H)2, where a great P excess is present in the catalyst surface. Thus, the role of the active phase, the preparation method and the silica support employed on the activity of the prepared catalysts are detailed. Characterization results reveal that the usage of nickel citrate provides catalysts with a small particle size, regardless of the material support used, although they suffer from deactivation in the HDC reaction due to the agglomeration of the active phase. Ni2P based catalysts prepared from nickel(II) dihydrogenphosphite, also form small particles that are more stable than Ni ones due to the weaker interaction with Cl species and the greater presence of hydrogen spillover species on the support and hydrogen species on the metal\u2013support interface. These hydrogen species in the metal\u2013support interface are ascribed to the P excess present in the catalyst surface. Moreover Cab-O-Sil based catalysts are more active than SBA-ones due to the higher stability of the active phase in the former.",

In contrast, bulk CuO oxides with sizes greater than 450\u00a0nm exhibited no activity at low temperatures. Several monolayers of chemisorbed species, such as water/hydroxyls and carbonate/hydrocarbonates, were typically observed at the surface of the nanopowders. These species were not critical for the LT oxidation of CO, and their preliminary removal did not substantially change the activity of the nanopowders. XPS results indicated a high deficiency of the oxygen sublattice of the CuO1\u2212x (x\u00a0=\u00a00.1\u20130.15) nanopowders, whereas, for the lattice of bulk CuO, the Cu/O ratio was 1.

A large cluster model (H53O52Si35Al) has been employed here to study the bi-molecular process and these results are contrasted to the mono-molecular results previously reported by the author using the same model. The results suggest that a bi-molecular process can indeed result in the formation of iso-butene, as well as longer chained by-products as exemplified by 2,4,4-trimethylpent-2-ene. A rate determining step of 18.6\u00a0kcal/mol is found for the bi-molecular process, involving CC bond formation between the two monomers. The barrier is also predicted to be considerably lower than that of the mono-molecular reaction (24.5\u00a0kcal/mol).

     "abstract": "The interaction of 1,3-diethers and MgCl2 support was studied. It was found 1,3-diethers interact with the surface of MgCl2 support more selectively than esters. 1,3-Diethers form several surface complexes of different strength. At that, a strength of all surface complexes of 1,3-diethers considerably exceeds a strength of surface complexes of ethyl benzoate. The strength of some surface complexes of 1,3-diethers is close to that of surface complexes of dibutyl phthalate, and dibutyl phthalate is able to substitute 1,3-diethers from these complexes. The least strong surface complexes of 1,3-diethers are labile and can also be removed from the MgCl2 surface without action of any electron donors. In contrast to the MgCl2 support, the catalyst contains only more strong and unremovable surface complexes of 1,3-diether. This testifies on the formation of certain faces of MgCl2 during catalyst preparation in the presence of 1,3-diether contrary to the formation of different MgCl2 faces at the preparation of the MgCl2 support.",

Adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of Brilliant Red X-3B (X3B), an anionic azo dye, in TiO2 suspensions using O2 and O3 as oxidants, TNTs and P25 TiO2 as photocatalysts, respectively.

The reducibility of nickel ions incorporated into BEA zeolites by ion exchange was investigated by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The acidity of the samples was characterized with strong (pyridine (Py) and ammonia (NH3)) and weak (nitrogen) bases. The adsorbed bases were studied by transmission FT-IR (Py), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy (N2), and temperature-programmed ammonia evolution (TPAE, NH3). Over Ni/H-[B]BEA the reactants were completely converted via fast hydrogenolysis, whereas this reaction pathway plays only a negligible role in the hydroconversion over Ni/H-[Al]BEA and Ni/H-[Al,B]BEA zeolites. Boron-containing BEA zeolites were less active catalysts than the boron-free catalyst in the principal unimolecular hydroconversion reactions. However, incorporation of boron into the framework of BEA zeolite results in a considerable selectivity shift toward isomerization. Results suggest that the acid strength of bridged hydroxyls, probed with weak (N2) and strong basis (pyridine), was found to be similar in the boron-free and boron-containing BEA samples. The decrease in the isomerization rate and the increase of the apparent activation energy upon incorporation of boron may be attributed to the decrease in the heat of n-heptane adsorption.",

TiO2 was identified as the support leading to the most stable Pt metallic phase, catalytic phase on which the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions take place. The presence of acidic sites brought by the oxide support is necessary for the dehydration reactions (i.e. for CO cleavages), but a too high quantity of these sites can promote the CC bond cleavages via an acidic cracking mechanism.

Control experiments indicated that phenol degradation was mainly initiated by the excited WO3 in Fe2O3/WO3, and that there was a synergistic effect between two oxides. A spin trapping electron paramagnetic resourance spectroscopy revealed that the production of hydroxyl radicals over Fe2O3/WO3 was greatly enhanced. Solid characterization with X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption and element mapping showed that Fe2O3 particles were highly dispersed in the sample, with a small size and high surface area.

While the presence of ImH has no effect on the catalytic activity of the Fe-porphyrins containing pyridyl or N-methylated pyridyl substituents at the meso-positions, the catalytic performance of the other Fe-porphyrins significantly increased by the use of ImH in 5:1 molar ratio with respect to the catalyst. As was observed in the comparison of the Mn-porphyrins with pyridyl substituents, the oxidative stability of FeT(4-py)P(OAc) is remarkably higher than that of FeT(2-py)P(OAc) and FeT(3-py)P(OAc). Also, the same order of relative stability was found in the case of the N-methylated analogues. It is noteworthy that N-methylation of FeT(py)P(OAc) complexes led to the substantial decrease in their oxidative stability. Competitive oxidation of cis- and trans-stilbene, provides indirect evidence for the involvement of high valent Fe-oxo porphyrins as well as periodato iron porphyrins as the active oxidant in reactions catalyzed by the used iron porphyrins. However, the involvement of a high valent iron-oxo porphyrin species is more pronounced in the case of FeTPPS4(OAc), FeT(2-py)P(OAc), FeT(3-py)P(OAc), FeT(4-py)P(OAc) and the N-methylated analogues. Also, an unusual preference of trans-stilbene over cis-stilbene was observed in the competitive epoxidation reaction catalyzed by FeT(3-MePy)P(OAc) and FeT(4-MePy)P(OAc) which cannot be described by the cis/trans isomerization. Furthermore, significant cis/trans isomerization observed upon oxidation of cis-stilbene in the reaction catalyzed by FeT(2-MePy)P(OAc) indicates that steric effects due to the presence of methyl groups at the ortho positions of this complex are of minor importance. On the other hand, large differences were observed in the product distribution for oxidation reactions with TBAO performed in dichloromethane and aqueous solvent. In spite of the lack of close correlation between the catalytic activity of the Fe-porphyrins and the electronic properties of the meso-substituents, in comparison with the corresponding Mn-porphyrins, there is a better correlation between the catalytic activity of the Fe-porphyrins and the electronic effects of the meso-groups.",

     "abstract": "Hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) resolves racemic epoxides using water as the nucleophile and is most often catalyzed by chiral Co(III)-salens.1 Previous studies have shown that the counter-ion of the Co(III)-salen has a direct effect on rate of HKR; when catalyzed by a 50:50 mix of (R,R)-Co(III)-salen-OH and (R,R)-Co(III)-salen-SbF6, the fastest HKR rates occurred. It has further been shown that the enantioselectivity is primarily associated with the reaction of (R,R)-Co(III)-salen-OH on the activated epoxide. Based on the aforementioned origin of selectivity, a catalyst containing a 50:50 mix of (R,R)-Co(III)-salen-OH and (\u00b1)-trans-Co(III)-salen-SbF6 could, in principle, give high activities and enantioselectivities for HKR comparable to a mixed counter-ion system containing both (R,R)-Co(III)-salens. Here, a series of experiments are described that demonstrate that highly selective catalysis is only achieved using 100% enantiopure ligand, and mixtures of (R,R)-Co(III)-salen and (\u00b1)-trans-Co(III)-salen yield lower activity and selectivity. Control experiments demonstrate this is due to rapid counter-ion scrambling under reaction conditions, precluding the possibility of effectively co-utilizing enantiopure (expensive) and racemic (inexpensive) catalysts with differing counter-ions. The mechanistic investigations resolving the counter-ion scrambling are consistent with the currently accepted mechanism for catalysis, involving cooperative activity of two Co(III)-salen species that activate the epoxide and water in the reaction.",

Meanwhile, the BT-CF-Au9@Pd3 catalyst could be re-used four times without significant loss of activity. In the fourth run, the substrate conversion was still as high as 92.70%, much better than that by using commercial Pd/C catalyst (42.60%). Additionally, BT-CF-Au9@Pd3 catalyst exhibited high hydrogenation activity to various alkenes and nitro-compounds. For example, the TOF of allyl alcohol, styrene and nitrobenzene hydrogenations reached 10,980, 14,732 and 1379\u00a0mol\u00a0mol\u22121\u00a0h\u22121, respectively.",

It was discovered that macroporous resin Amberlyst-15 showed good catalytic activity in oligomerization and polymerization, and lactate showed different catalytic efficiencies due to the differences in ionic radius and ionic charge. Compared to the traditional catalysts of SnCl2\u00b72H2O/TSA, the composite catalyst can improve the quality, yield and optical purity of its product, which can also be recycled without any residual in products. PLLA with molar mass of about 110,000\u00a0g\u00a0mol\u22121 was synthesized at the yield of 93%.

The adsorption isotherms showed presence of pores in the size range 6\u20137\u00a0nm for the mesoporous HZSM-5 and X-ray diffraction displayed a typical crystalline diffraction pattern corresponding to ZSM-5 for both the microporous and the mesoporous material.

The mesoporous and the microporous ZSM-5 zeolites were prepared with the same Si/Al molar ratio and diffuse reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm that the acidity of the materials was the same. Reaction over the microporous zeolite was regiospecific, giving acetylation only in the 3-position of 2-methylindole.

SEM images show a rectangular morphology for Ni/rutile and spherical morphology for Ni/TiO2 and Ni/anatase. The observed order of catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of crotanaldehyde is Ni/rutile\u00a0>\u00a0Ni/anatase\u00a0>\u00a0Ni/TiO2. The activity trend suggests that a higher dispersion of Ni has detrimental effect while surface concentration of Ni atoms determines the conversion of crotonaldehyde. The conversion (60%) and selectivity (86.4%) are found to be optimum at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and hydrogen pressure of 10\u00a0kg/cm2. Both Ni/rutile and Ni/anatase exhibited a better stability than Ni/TiO2. An increase in conversion with hydrogen pressure suggests preferential adsorption of hydrogen on Ni present on the catalyst surface. A higher selectivity for crotyl alcohol suggests a more favorable adsorption of CO group which is influenced by TiOx species present in the support.",

In this study we investigate the use of concentrated aqueous dispersions of mesoporous oxides to overcome incompatibility in the Friedel\u2013Crafts reaction between sodium salicylate and 4-tert-butylbenzyl chloride. The mesoporous material was first impregnated with the water-soluble nucleophile, sodium salicylate, and the \u201cloaded\u201d particles were then dispersed in the apolar electrophile, 4-tert-butylbenzyl chloride. A range of different mesoporous oxides and one clay mineral, montmorillonite, were investigated as catalyst for the reaction. These were all characterised with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and with nitrogen adsorption (BET and BJH methods). Their Lewis and Br\u00f8nstedt acidities were determined by ammonia adsorption experiments using diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy as detection method. The reaction proceeded well and gave high yields provided proper stirring was maintained. Alumina, an aluminosilicate and montmorillonate were the most efficient catalysts. These were also the materials that showed the strongest Lewis acidity. In general, there was good correlation between Lewis acidity and efficiency of the material as catalyst for the Friedel\u2013Crafts alkylation. Attempts to reuse the catalyst were not entirely successful. Deactivation occurred after the first run. ESCA indicated that the reduction in performance was due to adsorption of carbonaceous residues on the catalyst.",

The coke was preferably deposited on the acid sites. Neither the high nor the low reaction temperate was beneficial to decrease the amount of coke. The uniform dispersion of boron in the catalyst was good at reducing the formation of coke.

     "abstract": "The reactivity of nickel(II) thiophenealdoxime complex (3) toward oligomerization of ethylene in the presence of an alkylaluminum co-catalyst has been studied. The complex was found to be a selective ethylene dimerization catalyst in the presence of co-catalysts such as methylalumoxane (MAO) and diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC). With DEAC, the productivity was considerably higher than with MAO. Under optimum conditions the productivity reaches 388\u00a0kg/mol\u00a0catalyst/h/bar with DEAC whereas for MAO this value was 119\u00a0kg/mol\u00a0catalyst/h/bar. Complex 3 displays good ethylene conversions of up to a maximum of 90% with exceptionally high \u03b1-selectivity for 1-butene (>99.5%) amongst C4 products. Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) were also carried out to ascertain the decomposition pathway for 3 as well as that for Ni(II) complex of the pyridine ketoxime ligand 2. The results suggest that loss of one of the two bidentate oxime ligands attached to the metal center through reaction with DEAC is likely for both 2 and 3. Further, calculations indicate that the subsequent decomposition step was significantly more probable for 3 than for 2 thus explaining why the pyridine ketoxime ligand bound nickel complex 2 was experimentally found to be more stable than the thiophene aldoxime bound nickel complex 3. Calculations also show that the proton of the -OH group (oxime) plays a major role in the stability of the molecules. This was confirmed experimentally by synthesizing the Ni(II) dichloro complex of Pyridine-2-carbaldehyde O-methyloxime 5 and reacting it with ethylene under similar conditions. 5 was found to be highly active even at low co-catalyst concentrations.",

     "abstract": "In this study, the influence of the temperature on the photodegradation process using Ag-doped TiO2 nanostructures was investigated. Two morphologies were used; nanoparticles and nanofibers. The nanofibers were synthesized by electrospinning of a sol\u2013gel consisting of titanium isopropoxide, silver nitrate and poly(vinyl acetate). The silver nitrate amount was changed to produce nanofibers having different silver contents. Typically, sol\u2013gels containing 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5\u00a0wt% silver nitrate were utilized. Calcination of the electrospun mats at 700\u00a0\u00b0C led to produce well morphology Ag-doped TiO2 nanofibers for all formulations. The nanoparticles were prepared from the same sol\u2013gels, however, instead of spinning the gels were dried, grinded and sintered at 700\u00a0\u00b0C. Photodegradation under UV irradiation for the rhodamine B at 5, 15, 25, 45 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C were performed. For the nanoparticles, increasing the temperature has positive impact as the best degradation was obtained at 55\u00a0\u00b0C. In contrast to the known influence of the temperature on the chemical reactions, in case of the nanofibrous morphology, the temperature has negative impact as the experimental work indicated that the optimum temperature is 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The observed strange effect of the temperature in case of the nanofibrous morphology indicates instant degradation of the dye molecules in the active zones surrounding the nanofibers. Therefore, the increase of temperature results in increase the kinetic energy of the dye molecules so the molecules escape from the active thin film surrounding the photocatalyst. Overall, this study shows that the nanofibrous morphology strongly enhances the surface activity of the photocatalyst which generates negative influence of the temperature.",

Application of strongly basic solvents \u2013 but also increasing hydrogen pressure or conversion \u2013 inverted the sense of enantiodifferentiation from (S)-alcohol (expected enantiomer based on the stereochemistry of CN) to (R)-alcohol. The known formation of hemiketals was the origin of the inversion in alcohols.

In contrast to former proposals, solvent acidity (\u03b1) did not play a significant role. The experimental results are validated by theoretical calculations. The docking of 1 to CN has been investigated in the absence of solvent and also in the presence of toluene and dimethyl formamide. Several competing docking complexes have been isolated that can coexist on the metal surface. Detailed analyses of these complexes show that their stabilities depend on the formation of enantiospecific local interactions between 1, CN, and the platinum surface. The presence of solvent interferes with these interactions, affecting the relative stability of the docking complexes.

The MT yield increased first and then decreased with the increase of reaction temperature for all of the catalysts due to the decomposition of methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide. The optimum loading of WO3 was found to be 5\u201310\u00a0wt.% (with a surface density of 3.5\u20134.5\u00a0w-atom\u00a0nm\u22122).

The transition states for methane sequential dissociations on the three surfaces were identified. The adsorption properties of the CHx (x\u00a0=\u00a00\u20133) and H species on Ni (1\u00a00\u00a00), Ni (1\u00a01\u00a01), and Ni (5\u00a05\u00a03) surfaces were also studied.

Among the surface species, carbon atom shows the most significant differences in adsorption energies between the different surfaces investigated; its adsorption strength follows the order Ni (1\u00a00\u00a00)\u00a0>\u00a0Ni (5\u00a05\u00a03)\u00a0>\u00a0Ni (1\u00a01\u00a01).

The analysis of the energetics for CH4 successive dehydrogenations on the various surfaces shows that on Ni (1\u00a01\u00a01), CH dehydrogenation proceeds with a barrier of 1.38\u00a0eV and was found to be the rate-determining step for CH4 dissociation on Ni (1\u00a01\u00a01).

The results showed that the Ni (5\u00a05\u00a03) and Ni (1\u00a00\u00a00) promote the dissociation of CHx species by lowering the activation barriers when compared to Ni (1\u00a01\u00a01) due to their high average energy of the d-band center.",

Natural solar energy which acts as a driving force for the generation of palladium nanoparticles makes the process attractive and economical. The obtained nanoparticles were thoroughly characterized by using techniques like TEM, SAED, FEG-SEM, XRD and EDAX. It was observed that up to 70% of the palladium nanoparticles have decahedron shape, while remaining 30% consists of all other different shapes. The citric acid helps in shapes selective synthesis, whereas concentrated solar energy supplies dual energy which helps to speed up the reduction process. The aqueous reaction mixture of palladium nanoparticles was directly employed for the Suzuki coupling reaction and hence centrifuging efforts and cost of reagents required for the isolation of nanoparticles were avoided. The synthesized nanoparticles demonstrated excellent catalytic activity in Suzuki coupling reaction of aryl halides with phenyl boronic acid under mild reaction conditions. The methodology is applicable to diverse substrates providing good to excellent yields of desired products.

Contrarily, by carrying out reactions directly in diol, and using DMF as the base, catalytic systems showed to be stable and efficient. Under these conditions, when approximately 40% of the diol has been converted into carbonate, CO2 begins to be formed, deriving from the CO oxidation promoted by H2O that accumulates in the system.

The bimetal-supported Co\u2013Mn\u2013HMS with loading 4\u00a0wt.% of Co and Mn exhibited the best catalytic performance in the oxidation of 4-tert-butyltoluene with O2, and gave a conversion of 43.7% of 4-tert-butyltoluene and maximal yield of 27.4% of 4-tert-butylbenzaldehyde in a reaction time of 5\u00a0h in liquid phase under mild condition. A high concentration and dispersion of M2+ (Co2+, Mn2+) and M3+ (Co3+, Mn3+) ions on catalysts were responsible for high catalytic performance in the oxidation reaction via a free-radical chain promoted by N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI). The four consecutive cycles revealed that the cobalt and manganese species supported on HMS provided a possibility for the heterogeneous oxidation reaction.",

The intermolecular Friedel\u2013Crafts alkylation for the formation of dihydrochalcones is more favorable than the intramolecular one for the generation of 1-indanones in the tandem reaction due to a stable six-membered ring transition state.

Thiophene has two types of adsorption geometries on Pt(1\u00a01\u00a00), Upright and Flat adsorptions.

The solvent effect was taken into account by B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) (SDD for Au) single-point calculation with a polarizable continuum model (PCM) in THF. The calculations indicated that the reaction of (IPr)AuOH with oxazole proceeds through two competing pathways: five-centered transition state and four-centered transition state. The process of forming five-membered transition structure is more favored kinetically with a barrier of 31.7\u00a0kcal/mol versus 41.8\u00a0kcal/mol for the pathway of forming four-membered transition structure. The major pathway of the cycle involves the formation of a carbene intermediate. Subsequent step for reaction of this intermediate with CO2 then provides the final carboxylate product. Meanwhile, the activation free energies for the different ligands or metal center also have been calculated and the same reactivity trends have been found. Our calculation results are good consistent with the experimental observation of Nolan and co-workers for N-heterocyclic carbene gold(I) complexes.

     "abstract": "In this work, it has been investigated a membrane-like effect of ionic liquid (IL) in the multistep catalytic hydrogenation of trans-cinnamaldehyde (CALD) and 1,5-ciclooctadiene (1,5-COD). A commercial Pd/C catalyst was impregnated with 1-hexyl-3-methyl-imidazolium at 0.5\u201310\u00a0wt%. SEM, EDS, XRD, TG and BET data suggested that the IL penetrates the carbon pore structure coating the catalyst, especially at 5 and 10% concentration. The presence of the IL layer strongly affected the selectivities of the hydrogenations of CALD and 1,5-COD. In the case of CALD, the IL favored the formation of the fully hydrogenated product (hydrocinnamyl alcohol). This result is discussed in terms of a membrane-like effect, in which the small H2 molecule diffuses more easily from toluene through the IL layer as compared to the larger cinnamaldehyde. This effect results in the production of comparatively higher concentrations of the Pd-H species, which favors the double hydrogenation. On the other hand, the IL layer during the 1,5-COD hydrogenation favored the intermediate product COE (cyclooctene). In this case, a membrane-like effect was also used to discuss the result, where the IL layer has the effect to expel the intermediate COE hindering its contact with the Pd surface.",

The two kinds of composites were prepared in a sequence of the same procedures, which involved reactions of TiCl3 and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) mixed solution at 190\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h to precipitate nano-size TiO2\u2212xNy particles, followed by mixing the TiO2\u2212xNy with a micro-size CaAl2O4:(Eu,Nd) or Sr4Al14O25:(Eu,Dy) particles by a facile planetary ball milling to yield CaAl2O4:(Eu,Nd)/TiO2\u2212xNy or Sr4Al14O25:(Eu,Dy)/TiO2\u2212xNy composites. Both composites showed the persistent photocatalytic degradation of NO and acetoaldehyde after turning off the light. CaAl2O4:(Eu,Nd)/TiO2\u2212xNy showed higher persistent NO destruction ability in dark after turning off the light, while Sr4Al14O25:(Eu,Dy)/TiO2\u2212xNy is excellent in CH3CHO removal. The difference in the photocatalytic activity observed for CaAl2O4:(Eu,Nd)/TiO2\u2212xNy and Sr4Al14O25:(Eu,Dy)/TiO2\u2212xNy might be attributed to the difference in the emission property.",

The preactivated solid catalyst has been washed by solvent to remove AlEt3 in the liquid phase, and chain transfer to AlEt3 was nearly completely suppressed.

Because of the unimolecular nature of \u03b2-H transfer after a secondary insertion, the content of 2-buten-4-yl end group, which is too low to be detected in PP polymerized under conventional conditions, was markedly increased in the product of monomer-starved polymerization.",

A 50% yield of 2 was attained in a 2-h reaction at 80\u00a0\u00b0C, with a turnover number being higher than 1200. Kinetics of the transformation of 1 into 2 have been studied. The results obtained indicate that the first step of the 1 activation is its interaction with a hydroxyl radical. Further transformations of the primary product formed in this step proceed via several routes, one of which leads to the formation of 2. It has been proposed that the interaction of vanadate with the first molecule of H2O2 gives a V(IV)-containing species and hydroperoxyl radical: \u201cVV\u2013OOH\u201d\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u201cVIV\u201d\u00a0+\u00a0HOO. In the next step, the V(IV) complex reacts with the second molecule of H2O2 affording a hydroxyl radical and recovering a starting V(V)-containing species: \u201cVIV\u201d\u00a0+\u00a0H2O2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u201cVV\u201d\u00a0+\u00a0HO\u2212\u00a0+\u00a0HO.

     "abstract": "The effect of magnetically recoverable CuFe2O4 nanoparticles on thermal decomposition of acetone and pinacolone cyclic organic diperoxides, and acetone triperoxide was studied. Ethanol, toluene or ethylbenzene were used as reaction solvents, the initial peroxide concentration was ca. 0.02\u00a0mol\u00a0L\u22121 and the amount of heterogeneous catalyst added was ca. 0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121. CuFe2O4 nanoparticles, obtained according to the citric acid-aided process, greatly accelerates the thermal decomposition of methyl substituted cyclic peroxide, but in the case of pinacolone diperoxide only slightly catalytic effects can be detected, probably due to the presence of the bulky tert-butyl substituent in the proximity of the OO bond. This heterogeneously catalyzed reaction can be explained by a free radical mechanism which involves the initiation reaction on the catalyst surface. The products detected (ethane, 2,2-dimethylpropane, ethylbenzene, bibenzyl and 2,3-diphenylbutane) can be interpreted in terms of the initial OO bond homolysis catalyzed by copper ferrites to form an iron peroxo radical species which later undergoes CO and CC bond cleavage. The reduction of the reaction temperature in the styrene and methylmethacrylate polymerization processes could be the main application of the results obtained in the present work, where the thermal decomposition of multifunctional cyclic peroxides in the presence of copper ferrites can be reached decreasing the working temperatures.",

Conversion of hydrogen over Pd/HZSM-5-X catalysts showed no great difference, while selectivity for hydrogen peroxide over the catalysts exhibited a volcano-shaped curve with respect to Si/Al molar ratio. As a consequence, yield for hydrogen peroxide over the catalysts showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to Si/Al molar ratio.

Yield for hydrogen peroxide increased with increasing B/L ratio of Pd/HZSM-5-X catalysts.

Over these zeolites, BT underwent only alkylation, whereas 2-methyl-1-pentene underwent alkylation, isomerization and oligomerization. HY was shown to be the most active and stable in BT conversion. HMCM-22 had a low initial activity and a poor stability, due to both diffusional limitations and fast deactivation of its acid sites, even those located in the external pockets. HBEA presented an intermediate behavior. The presence of toluene led to a decrease of BT conversion, which was attributed to competitive adsorptions of the aromatic and the olefin.Whatever the zeolite and the conversion, BT was predominantly transformed into monoalkylated products whereas 3-methylthiophene led essentially to dialkylated products. These results are in agreement with those obtained from theoretical calculations. HMCM-22 zeolite was shown to be the most selective toward alkylation versus olefin oligomerization.",

Transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed reduction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used to investigate the effect of CNT confinement on the catalytic performance of CeO2 inside CNTs. The results indicate that CNT tubular structure results in strengthened interaction between CeO2 and inner wall, which induces distortion and reducibility of CeO2 lattices to promote the activation of surface lattice oxygen and the formation of oxygen vacancy. The activated surface oxygen and oxygen vacancy from CeO2\u2013CNT composites play an important role in two-step ODH reaction by promoting reverse water\u2013gas shift reaction. In addition, CeO2 filled into shorter CNTs exhibits higher catalytic activities due to decreasing the diffusion resistance of reactants and products in CNT channels.

Based on characterization data, SiO2 was suggested to have a planar structure and \u03b3-Al2O3 a porous structure, which markedly influenced the activity and stability of the supported catalysts. Use of ultrasound during catalyst preparation was found to make the particle sizes of the samples smaller, leading to the active particles being more dispersed on the carrier and leading to an increase in the conversion of benzophenone. Using ultrasound protocols, a Ni\u2013La\u2013B amorphous alloy supported on SiO2 (Ni\u2013La\u2013B/SiO2-u) initially showed better activity and selectivity than a Ni\u2013La\u2013B amorphous alloy supported on \u03b3-Al2O3 (Ni\u2013La\u2013B/\u03b3-Al2O3-u); whereas Ni\u2013La\u2013B/SiO2-u showed poor stability compared to Ni\u2013La\u2013B/\u03b3-Al2O3-u. The main reason for the deactivation of Ni\u2013La\u2013B/SiO2-u was ascribed to the adsorption of reactants and products onto the catalyst surface and their coverage of the active Ni sites.",

Au/TiO2 catalyst had both high CO oxidation activity and high H2 oxidation activity. Adding suitable amount of Co3O4 on Au/TiO2 could enhance CO conversion to a higher extent and suppress H2 oxidation. On Au/TiO2 catalysts, gold nucleates at oxygen defect sites of anatase TiO2 and remains highly dispersed and in good contact with the support. The gold atoms directly in contact with TiO2 are positively charged and highly stable. Doping with cobalt oxide increases the number of oxygen defects on TiO2, thus leading to a higher concentration of strongly bound gold atoms. The amorphous nature of Co3O4 along with TiO2 not only enhances electronic interaction between Au and Co3O4\u2013TiO2, but also stabilizes the nano-size gold particles, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of CO towards higher extent.",

However, details on how crown ethers catalyze ionic SN2 reactions and control selectivity are not well understood. In this work, we have used high level theoretical calculations to shed light on the details of phase-transfer catalysis mechanism of KF reaction with alkyl halides promoted by 18-crown-6. A complete analysis of the of the model reaction between KF(18-crown-6) and ethyl bromide reveals that the calculations can accurately predict the product ratio and the overall kinetics. Our results point out the importance of the K+ ion and of the crown ether ring in determining product selectivity. While the K+ ion favors the SN2 over the E2 anti pathway, the crown ether ring favors the SN2 over E2 syn route. The combination effects lead to a predicted 94% for the SN2 pathway in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 92%. A detailed analysis of the overall mechanism of the reaction under phase-transfer conditions also reveals that the KBr product generated in the nucleophilic fluorination acts as an inhibitor of the 18-crown-6 catalyst and it is responsible for the observed slow reaction rate.",

It was found that both catalysts suffered deactivation, with the conversion of crotonaldehyde decreasing from 31 to 6% over the Pt/CeO2 catalyst and 20 to 7% over the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, which was due to the formation of organic compounds on the catalyst surface as revealed by temperature programmed oxidation technique on the spent catalysts, and the poisoning effect of CO chemisorptions on Pt atoms via decarbonylation reaction. For the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, selectivity to crotyl alcohol reached 48% and kept stable during the reaction, while for the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the selectivity to crotyl alcohol decreased dramatically from 51 to 33%. The decrease of selectivity for the Pt/CeO2 catalyst was attributed to carbon deposit formed on the catalyst surface by the reaction between CO and reduced Ce3+ ion in CeO2. However, for the Pt/ZrO2, no carbon deposit was formed on the catalyst surface, which could account for the stable selectivity during the reaction process.",

The experimental results are consistent with the previously proposed mechanism for the oxidative carbonylation of arenes. The reaction is initiated by coordination of toluene to the Pd(II) complex and activation of a CH bond in the benzene ring. This initial step becomes rate limiting when a sufficiently high (NH4VO3)/Pd ratio is used for the reoxidation of Pd(0) to Pd(II). Both processes are found to be dependent on the electron withdrawing and donating capability of the anionic ligands. Overall catalyst activity peaks for ligands of intermediate basicity, and diminishes for both more and less basic ligands. Theoretical analysis of the coordination of toluene and activation of the CH bond on the benzene ring reveals that the basicity of the ligands affects the two processes in opposite ways. Weakly basic ligands promote the coordination of toluene but have the opposite effect on the activation of the CH bond. The tradeoff in these two effects leads to a maximum in the apparent rate coefficient with pKa of the conjugate acid of the anionic ligands. The absence of significant product stereoselectivity is due to a lack of steric hindrance in the binding of toluene to the Pd(II) complex.",

The propane oxidation activity of Pt/CZ is greatly improved after sulfate addition.

The specific surface area of the sulfated catalyst decreases from 40 to 14\u00a0m2/g by the blocking effect of surface sulfates, and no obvious structure change is observed according to the XRD results. The spectra of CO adsorption indicate that Pt is on a more electronic-deficient state due to the electronic withdrawing effect of sulfates. Some more active sites are suggested to be generated at the interface of platinum and sulfates according to the activation energy calculation. The formation of such interfacial active sites plays an important role in CH cracking as evidenced by a series of in situ DRIFTS results of propane adsorption.

The heat treated TiHap particles were also used after treated original particles at 650\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h, called as heat treated particles. All the original particles were made up by rod-like particles with irregular size, while the heat treated particles were rounded by sintering and their sizes were enlarged in each XTi system. The TiHap particles were cation deficient particles with (Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti)/P atomic ratio ranging between 1.54 and 1.64. The XTi values of TiHap particles assayed showed approximately the dosage of Ti(IV) ions in each system. All the TiHap particles employed exhibited UV absorption below ca. 370\u00a0nm, though the UV absorption characteristics did not vary by the heat treatment. However, the pure calcium hydroxyapatite with XTi\u00a0=\u00a00 had no UV absorption. The IR spectra of the particles with XTi\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.05 exhibited a new large peak at 3428\u00a0cm\u22121 close to the peak at 3570\u00a0cm\u22121 of OH\u2212 ions together with the bands at 3654\u20133682 or 3673 (surface POH groups) and 3737\u00a0cm\u22121 (surface TiOH groups).

The expansion of crystal structure along with c direction by the heat treatment was identified by the unit-cell dimension obtained from the XRD patterns. It was concluded therefore that the produced dislocated OH\u2212 ions by the heat treatment induce the photocatalytic activity of TiHap particles. The strong photocatalytic activity of TiHap particles was attributed to the dislocated OH\u2212 ions because they can produce OH radicals in the particles without water molecules by UV irradiation.

Acidity of BAILs was determined using volumetric titration and UV\u2013visible spectroscopic methods. The Hammett acidity order and acid value of BAILs correlate well with the activity order observed for most of the BAILs in the hydration reaction of phenylacetylene. Theoretical studies demonstrate that hydrogen bonding plays a key role in tuning the acidity of BAILs. Density function theory calculations are also able to explain the difference in activity observed in these BAILs. The activity of ionic liquids was theoretically studied by computing the activation energy for the hydration reaction. Recycling experiments suggest that these novel BAILs can be reused without significant loss in activity.

The calculation results indicate that there are two possible pathways for the hydrogenation reaction on Pdn cluster from the reactant acetylene to the product ethane. One of the pathways undergoes through two intermediates, the vinyl (Pdn(H)\u22efCHCH2) and ethene (Pdn\u22efCH2CH2) to form the ethane, and the other goes along vinylidene (Pdn(2H)\u22efCCH2), ethylidyne Pdn(2H)\u22efCCH3) and ethylidene (Pdn(2H)\u22efCHCH3) to ethane. Those intermediates in the two pathways can convert into each other which make the reaction profile complicated. The value of n in Pdn cluster can directly affect the reaction pathway: when n\u00a0\u2264\u00a04, the acetylene hydrogenation reaction will proceed via the pathway of Pdn(2H)\u22efCHCH\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Pdn(H)\u22efCHCH2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Pdn\u22efCH2CH2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Pdn(2H)\u22efCH2CH2 to form ethane.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies proved the formation of ZnO bond and wurtzite structure with smaller crystal size in doped nanofibers.

     "abstract": "A TiO2/ZrO2 powder was prepared using TiOSO4 and ZrOCO3 through a homogeneous co-precipitation process. The Pt-loaded TiO2/ZrO2 catalyst was obtained by loading Pt onto the powder via an incipient wetness approach. The catalyst samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, degree of dispersion, N2 adsorption\u2013desorption (BET) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the catalytic activity was significantly affected by Pt loadings, reduction temperatures and the reaction temperatures. A synergetic effect took place between photocatalytic and thermocatalytic reactions when benzene was engaged in the thermo-photocatalytic degradation. For 80\u00a0mg\u00a0m\u22123 benzene, the kinetic constant of thermo-photocatalysis was 1.26, 1.64, 2.15 and 2.93 times higher than these ones of single photocatalysis, when 90\u00a0\u00b0C, 120\u00a0\u00b0C, 150\u00a0\u00b0C and 180\u00a0\u00b0C was applied to the reaction, respectively. The rate constant at 150\u00a0\u00b0C, presented by the thermo-photocatalytic reaction, was 2 times higher than it was obtained from the photocatalytic reaction, under various experiment conditions. It was also found that, highly concentrated benzene, in a concentration of 1000\u00a0mg\u00a0m\u22123, was degraded effectively by thermo-photocatalysis and the mineralization rate reached 90.3% within 16\u00a0h. The thermo-photocatalytic technique was considered to have practical application foreground in the degradation of highly concentrated benzene.",

The optimum surface concentration of Pd on TiO2 was 0.005\u20130.01\u00a0atom/nm2; because the supported amount of Pd is extremely small relative to the surface area of the support, the supported Pd is thought to be monoatomically dispersed.

It was considered that the active site could be of two kinds: (i) pairs of Cu+ ions located at opposite sides of the ten-membered rings of the zeolite, in the region at the intersection of the linear and sinusoidal channels; (ii) isolated Cu+ ions. DFT calculations were performed by using the B3LYP functional on cluster models suited to reproduce the geometrical constraints of the ZSM-5 structure. It was shown that both the Cu+-pair mechanism and that catalyzed by a single-Cu+ site proceed through the formation of N2O as a reaction intermediate, which further reacts with the oxygen atom of a ZCu\u2013O\u2013CuZ or ZCuO unit (Z\u00a0=\u00a0zeolite) to give O2\u00a0+\u00a0N2. The latter step displayed a larger activation energy in the Cu+-pair mechanism, which is therefore unfavored although the pathway associated to Cu+-pairs occurs at lower energy than that associated to a single-Cu+ site. Such a large activation energy is associated to the stability of the ZCu\u2013O\u2013CuZ fragment. A quantitative analysis, performed by means of the energetic span model of Kozuch and Shaik, reinforced the just outlined observations.",

The prepared catalysts have been tested for catalytic reduction of p-nitrophenol (p-NPh) in presence of sodium borohydride. Using the Au/TiO2 prepared by in situ method, the reaction rate of the catalytic reduction of p-NPh was found to be 6 times higher when the amount of Au decreases from 5\u00a0wt% to 0.3\u00a0wt%. However, Au photodeposited onto TiO2 is much better 2 times higher than that in situ Au/TiO2 prepared. The larger catalytic activity of the Au/TiO2 nanocomposites prepared by photodeposition process is attributed to the higher dispersity and the small size of the Au particles (10\u00a0nm). The results indicated that a highly ordered mesoporous system is not a prerequisite for high catalytic activity.

During the hydrothermal process, 1D PANI can act as an effective template to stabilize TiO2 particles at nanoscale through interfacial chemical bonds. In this way, the transition of some newly formed anatase crystals to rutile phase is partly suppressed. Also, the as-prepared composites show obvious light response in a wide range of 230\u2013900\u00a0nm due to the sensitizing effect of PANI. Ns exhibit the improved visible photocatalytic property with scarce decrease of UV photoactivity. Overall, this work would provide new insights into the fabrication of conducting polymer/semiconductor composites with desired nanostructure as high performance photocatalysts and would facilitate their applications in environmental purification and solar energy conversion.",

Moreover, the reactor outlet gas was continuously monitored on-line also during the catalyst activation and deactivation steps. Several techniques were utilized to characterize the catalyst and reaction products and to correlate their properties with the growth mechanism and operating conditions. The stability of the catalyst activity was also investigated.The carbon content in the synthesis product increased as the temperature, ratio of feed flow/catalyst mass, C2H4 partial pressure and reaction time increased. With increasing temperature, an increase in ethylene conversion was observed, catalyst efficiency and lifetime ensure very high yields and selectivity.The catalytic effect of Al2O3 is established, a growth mechanism in particular in terms of the support role, is proposed.

     "abstract": "The regioselectivity in the hydroformylation reaction catalyzed by an unmodified Rh catalyst has been investigated for a number of \u03b1-methylsubstituted alk-1-enes (3-methylbut-1-ene MB1, 3-methylpent-1-ene MP1, 3,4-dimethylpent-1-ene DMP1, and 3,4,4-trimethylpent-1-ene TMP1) experimentally (at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0atm CO/H2 total pressure) and theoretically at the B3P86/6-31G* level with Rh described by effective core potentials in the LanL2DZ valence basis set. For all substrates the formation of the linear aldehyde (L) with respect to the branched one (B) in a prevailing amount has been observed (L/B\u00a0>\u00a062/38); the L isomer was formed as the almost exclusive product in the case of TMP1 (L/B\u00a0=\u00a095/5). 2H NMR investigations of crude reaction mixtures, coming from analogous deuterioformylation experiments interrupted at partial substrate conversion, showed that in the case of TMP1 only the branched alkyl-rhodium intermediate, precursor of the branched aldehyde, via \u03b2-hydride elimination mainly generates terminal deuterated olefins and, to a lesser extent, internal ones. The reversibility of the branched alkyl-Rh intermediates accounts for the high regioselectivity in favor of the linear aldehyde. Computational studies confirm the importance of the alkyl-Rh transition state (TS) stability to reproduce the experimental regioselectivity, or even to predict it, when the reaction is nonreversible (i.e. for MB1, MP1, and DMP1). In the case of TMP1, the free energy profiles for further reaction steps along branched and linear pathways have been examined to elucidate the origin of reaction reversibility. The TS for the alkyl migratory insertion onto the CO coordinated to rhodium, higher than that for the alkyl-Rh intermediate formation, explains the reason why in deuterioformylation experiments at partial conversion the monodeuterated terminal olefin TMP1-1-d1 is obtained. This occurs for one out of two most populated reactant conformers of TMP1, although for the Curtin\u2013Hammett principle reactant populations are not particularly important. For the other, the reaction proceeds to the branched aldehyde. Only for a less populated reactant conformer the internal olefin is obtained. Conversely, along the linear pathway the CO addition and alkyl migratory insertion steps occur, respectively, in a practically spontaneous way and with very low TS in any case. Agostic interactions (using the QTAIM theory) and kinetic isotope effects have been evaluated and discussed. The examination of further reaction steps for DMP1 allowed us to demonstrate that the reaction is nonreversible for that substrate, despite the similarity between DMP1 and TMP1. The tert-butyl group exerts its steric hindrance mainly on the very first branched reaction steps, favoring an alkyl-Rh TS arrangement lower in free energy than the alkyl-Rh migratory insertion onto the coordinated CO. In part the branched material returns to the reactant complex, thus enriching the linear fraction.",

The catalyst is mainly prepared by heating FeOOH precipitated onto powdery cellulose from FeCl3 solution. Nanoscale iron catalysts with the average particle sizes of 25\u201330\u00a0nm can promote decomposition reactions of the N-containing heterocyclic compounds in inert gas at >500\u00a0\u00b0C and provide N2 yields of 40\u201345% after the almost complete decomposition of pyrrole at 600\u00a0\u00b0C or pyridine at 650\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C. Iron catalyst with the mean size of 100\u2013500\u00a0nm, prepared from Fe(NO3)3 impregnated with a commercial activated carbon, is also active for the decomposition of the heterocyclic N-compounds, but it is almost inactive for N2 formation, the yields being as low as less than 2% in all cases. The increase in the number of pulses lowers the catalytic activity of iron nanoparticles for N2 formation, whereas in situ H2 treatment at 500\u00a0\u00b0C after reaction can restore it to the almost original state. On the basis of the above-mentioned results, it is likely that the activity of iron catalyst for N2 formation from pyrrole or pyridine is very sensitive to the iron particle size, and the in situ H2 treatment is effective for recovery of the decreased catalytic performance.",

The effects of four different synthetic procedures on the microstructures of CdS/TiO2 composites, such as morphology, crystal structure, porous property and optical response, were investigated in detail. It was found that CdS/TiO2 composites consisted of anatase TiO2 and cubic phase CdS. The hydrothermal treatment of mixed reactant-containing solution improved the crystallinity of both CdS and TiO2. The abundant pores in catalyst particles formed by CO2 gas bubbles due to hydrothermal decomposition of the urea molecules increased the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts. Meanwhile, the absorption edges of CdS/TiO2 samples were drastically extended to around 550\u00a0nm.

The sample prepared by hydrothermal reaction with CdS and TiO2 in the molar ratio of 0.25:1 showed the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation among all samples in this work, which could be attributed to the synergic effects of some factors, such as the excellent crystallinity, high specific surface area, large pore volume and strong absorption in the visible light region.

Isothermal kinetics curves in the temperature range from 303 to 343\u00a0K for both CH and MWH were determined. By application the model-fitting method, it was recognized that the kinetics of sucrose hydrolysis can be described by a first-order chemical reaction for both heating modes. The values of the activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (ln\u00a0A) for sucrose hydrolysis were found to be lower under MWH than under CH. Application of the differential isoconversional method showed that sucrose hydrolysis was kinetically an elementary reaction. It is found that the increased rate of hydrolysis observed under MWH was not a consequence of overheating. A new explanation of the established effects of microwave heating based on a model of selective energy transfer during the chemical reaction is suggested. The established decreases in the activation energy and in the pre-exponential factor under MWH in comparison to CH is explained by an increase in the energy of the ground vibrational level of the \u2013OH out-of-plane deformation in the sucrose molecule and with a decrease in the anharmonicity factor, which is caused by the selective resonant transfer of energy from the catalyst to the \u2013OH oscillators in the sucrose molecules.",

     "abstract": "Methanol steam reforming (MSR), catalyzed by the PdZn alloy, produces hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide with high selectivity. However, the mechanism for MSR has not been completely elucidated. It has been proposed that formate and methyl formate are possible intermediates in MSR. In this study, plane-wave density functional theory was used to investigate the role of methyl formate in MSR on PdZn. It is shown that methyl formate can indeed be formed by a reaction between formaldehyde and methoxyl. In the presence of surface OH species, methyl formate can further react to form formic acid, which can finally dehydrogenate to produce CO2. However, our calculations show that this hydrolysis process might have difficulties competing with desorption of methyl formate, which is weakly adsorbed on the PdZn surface. Our calculated results thus suggest a minor role for the methyl formate pathway in MSR. Interestingly, the methyl formate reaction pathway shares many similarities with the same process on copper, which is the traditional catalyst for MSR. The insights gained by studying the reaction mechanism on these two surfaces shed valuable light on designing future catalysts for the MSR process.",

MOR channels were large enough for the isomerization of 4,4\u2032-DIPPE at high temperatures because of the fluctuations of zeolite structure and organic molecules.These features of the isopropylation of PE were quite different from the isopropylation of biphenyl (BP), where no isomerization of 4,4\u2032-diisopropylbiphenyl occurred inside the channels.

A remarkable difference in the selectivity of the ring alkylation between heterogeneous and homogeneous systems is observed: Amberlyst 15 shows a constant ortho/para ratio close to 2, while in the presence of CH3SO3H ortho/para is variable from 3 to 5, suggesting an involvement of the cyclohexyl phenyl ether rearrangement.

Using TIBA as cocatalyst, the aryloxy-containing catalysts showed higher activity than a TiCl4/MgCl2 blank catalyst. Although the total 1-hexene incorporation of the copolymers prepared by the novel catalysts were lower than that of the blank system, the difference in 1-hexene content between the boiling n-heptane soluble part and the insoluble part was markedly lower, and the blockiness of comonomer sequence distribution was evidently higher. The TIBA activated aryloxy-containing catalysts were found to produce poly(ethylene-co-1-hexene) with more uniform chemical composition distribution.",

This active catalyst is alive only under reducing conditions and converted mainly to Ru(acac)3 along with other minor complexes when the catalytic reaction is over. A ruthenium(II) complex was isolated from the reaction solution after the complete catalytic hydrolysis of sodium borohydride and characterized to be [Ru{P(OMe)3}4H2] by single crystal XRD, MS, UV\u2013vis, FTIR, 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy.

Although the active catalyst could not be isolated from the reaction solution, it could be stabilized by adding chelating 2,2\u2032-bipyridine into the solution during the catalysis. Thus, a stabilized form of the active catalyst, [Ru(acac)(bipy){P(OMe)3}H], could be isolated and characterized by MS, UV\u2013vis, FTIR, 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy. [Ru(acac)(bipy){P(OMe)3}H] is expectedly not as active as the ruthenium(II) species formed in situ during the catalysis.

PtII complexes have been experimentally demonstrated to facilitate olefin hydroarylation. A TpPtII catalyst model (Tp\u00a0=\u00a0hydrido-tris(pyrazolyl)borate) was selected for computational studies. Nickel's low cost prompted its evaluation as it is isoelectronic to platinum. Computational results indicate that nickel and platinum operate through different mechanisms. The TpPt catalyst model activates benzene through a two-step oxidative addition/reductive elimination mechanism with a PtIV intermediate. However, the TpNi catalyst forms ethylbenzene product and closes the catalytic loop via a single step (sigma-bond metathesis) mechanism. Despite these differences in mechanism, comparable energy barriers (differing by ca. 2\u00a0kcal/mol), are derived from density functional theory (DFT) simulations.

In the actual study, this procedure has been extended to synthesize a series of Pd/PPy powders with variable palladium content and morphological parameters. Depending on the monomer-to-oxidant ratio in reaction mixture, average diameters of Pd and PPy particles may change in the ranges of 1.25\u20131.45 and 27\u201362\u00a0nm, respectively, the Pd concentration being within 33.5\u201342.0\u00a0wt.%. In general terms, decrease of the monomer-to-oxidant ratio led to formation of the Pd/PPy hybrid material with smaller diameters of both components and a higher Pd loading. The Pd/PPy composites have been studied in Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling and showed high catalytic efficiency. Aryl iodides, bromides and chlorides are active. The reaction can be performed using arylboronic acids or tetraarylborates, both in organic solvents and in water, thus making the process ecologically friendly. The recycling of the catalyst is possible if its particles are immobilized on the graphite support. The comparison of two samples revealed that Pd/PPy nanocomposite with the diameter of PPy spheres of about 30\u00a0nm is more efficient in catalysis, as compared to the sample with bigger PPy spheres (about 60\u00a0nm), due to transport limitations for reagents inside the polypyrrole sphere in the latter case. For palladium/polypyrrole nanocomposites with the small diameter of PPy sphere, which are easily penetrable for the reagents and in which all Pd nanoparticles are active, Pd content in polypyrrole spheres does not influence the yield of biaryls: the more is the Pd content in polypyrrole spheres, the less amount of catalyst is necessary to obtain the same yield of biaryl.",

The indirect bandgap values of the lepidocrocite samples were about 2.34, 2.36, and 2.31\u00a0eV for red, green, and blue light, respectively. The kinetics of the photo-decolorization of crystal violet (CV) was investigated in a system composed of lepidocrocite, H2O2, and visible light. H2O2 concentration, light irradiation, and catalyst concentration were also investigated. The rate of CV decolorization was found to fit pseudo-first-order kinetics. The results show that different as-prepared lepidocrocite have different adsorption and photocatalytic characteristics. A possible mechanism was also suggested for the dye degradation.",

     "abstract": "Self photodriven chromate reduction and oxalic acid oxidation are concomitantly achieved over the new hetero-system CuCr2O4/ZnO. The absorption of light promotes electrons in the sensitizer conduction band (CuCr2O4-CB) with a potential (\u22120.95 VSCE), too negative to be involved in an electron exchange with HCrO4\u2212 species. The improved activity is due to the electron injection from activated CuCr2O4 into ZnO-CB (\u22120.58 VSCE). The nitrate route is suitable to prepare active ZnO on which the chromate reduction occurs. A reduction of more than 60% of HCrO4\u2212 is achieved in air equilibrated solution under optimal conditions (pH\u223c3.5, 1\u00a0mg catalyst mL\u22121, 25\u00a0\u00b0C). The experimental data are fitted adequately with the modified Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model. The reduction follows a pseudo first order kinetic with a half life of 53\u00a0min for a concentration of 10\u22124\u00a0M. The oxidation of Cr3+ by photo holes and the competitive water reduction are though to be the main reasons of the regression in the photoactivity. The hetero-system favours hydrogen formation, with a rate evolution of 15\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0h\u22121\u00a0mg\u22121.",

The structure of the as-synthesized sample and the presence of the anions in the interlayer galleries of hydrotalcites, have been determined by X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy. On calcining the material at 450\u00a0\u00b0C, it was amorphous periclase phase. Re-hydration of the calcined phase resulted in the formation of hydrotalcite-like phase.

According to the catalytic peroxidation reaction for degrading both methylene blue and ethanol at 30\u00a0\u00b0C with pH value of 7.0, Mn2O3/SBA-15 catalyst displayed the excellent catalytic activities owing to the well distribution of Mn2O3 with large specific surface area, indicative of the potential practical application.

     "abstract": "Phenolic compounds removal is a very active research field due to occurrence and the toxicity of phenolic pollutants in industrial wastewaters. In order to make an a priori selection of the most efficient removal process for a target structure this contribution reviews and compares some of the mechanistic aspects of the oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and catalyzed by complexed iron which is the in-common element in Fenton systems, plant peroxidases and biomimetics. Different substrates were considered from the most basic phenol molecule to complex structures such as phenolic dyes and lignins. The reactivity of iron is related to its microenvironment generated by ligands and their electron withdrawing capacity thus conditioning the type of cleavage induced on hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation state change on iron upon reaction. The relative concentrations of organic to inorganic free radicals generated control the main catalytic action; i.e. from degradation up to mineralization in Fenton systems or oligomerization up to polymerization in plant peroxidases systems. Moreover, some reaction conditions as the peroxide concentration, the initial molar ratio of organic compounds to peroxide and the type of reaction solvent are identified as key factors to promote a desired action mechanism by peroxidases (and their biomimetics).",

In the present study, an in situ functionalization strategy was designed to fabricate mesoporous solid superbases based on the hard-templating synthetic system of mesoporous ceria. Sodium and potassium modified mesoporous ceria (NaMC and KMC) were successfully prepared, and structural and basic properties were characterized by various methods. The obtained materials exhibit well-expressed mesostructure and superbasicity with a high strength of 27.0. The basic solutions (namely NaOH and KOH aqueous solutions) play a double role by removing the silica template SBA-15 and functioning as the guests. Therefore, sodium and potassium can be coated onto mesoporous ceria formed in situ. This strategy allows the fabrication and functionalization of mesoporous ceria in one step, which avoids the destruction of mesoporous ceria in post-modification. The obtained mesoporous solid superbases also exhibit excellent catalytic performance in dimethyl carbonate (DMC) synthesis. The yield of DMC can reach 64.6% in 4\u00a0h over NaMC, which is apparently higher than those over the samples derived from post-modification (28.9%), nonmesoporous ceria (10.8%), as well as the conventional solid base magnesia (7.6%).",

Kinetic results and catalyst characterization by Fourier-transformed Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD), and high frequency CO2 pulses are used to obtain such mechanism. Temperature-programmed-oxidation experiments carried out up to intermediate temperatures made it possible to detect a transient kinetic response, in which a maximum in reaction rate at constant temperature was observed. This behavior is explained taking into account the amount of peroxides formed on the ceria surface. As the calcination temperature increases (from 400 to 800\u00a0\u00b0C), the amount of cerium superoxide and peroxide increases, thus accelerating the soot combustion reaction. These compounds were detected by FTIR. A higher total oxygen concentration on the ceria surface was detected by XPS on the catalyst calcined at high temperature. Carbon dioxide is not adsorbed on this support. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the formation of superoxides and peroxides. The latter are the active species that react with soot. These steps are strongly affected by temperature, being it possible to explain the kinetic results with this mechanism.",

And to investigate solvent effects, the reactions are simulated in CH3OH solvent by using the conductor like solvent model (COSMO). In our calculation, the uncatalyzed MC methanolysis reaction is kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable. However, it is obviously catalyzed by acid and base catalysts. By orbital energy calculation, MC methanolysis reaction is considered as the charge-controlled reaction. Thus, electrostatic potential fitted charges as reaction indicator is used to infer the activity of species after catalyst Zn(NH3)2(NCO)2 initiation. And it is confirmed to be successful in reactivity prediction. The catalytic cycles involved the selected active species are proposed. By calculating activation energies, the catalytically active species is considered to be Zn(NH3)2(NCO)(NHCOOCH3), which derives from the reaction of Zn(NH3)2(NCO)2 with CH3OH. The DMC synthesis from the catalytically active species and CH3OH is favored, of which the reaction activation energy is effectively decreased.",

The presence of either Ce or Co promoters greatly enhanced the catalytic activity of the solids in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2, when compared to Sn and Mn analogues, due to their easy reducibility. The cobalt species (FeCo2O4 and CoOx) in the CoFeSi catalyst determined the activity. Severe reaction conditions provoked the formation of amorphous carbon, and also graphitic species were observed. In addition, the reducibility of Co species may play a role in favouring the formation of hard carbonaceous deposits, as the redox process involved the Co and Fe species in the ethylbenzene and CO2 environments.

Both polymer samples were fractionated into 9\u201310 fractions according to molecular weight, and [C*]/[Ti] in each fraction was also determined. Adding small amount of ethylene in 1-hexene polymerization markedly increased the number of active centers that produce low molecular weight polymer. This phenomenon agrees with the mechanism suggesting the presence of Ti\u2212CH(CH3)(CH2)3CH3 type dormant sites and their activation by ethylene. The kp value of the newly emerging active centers in the copolymerization system is much lower than that of the homopolymerization system. In the copolymerization system, the active centers producing polymer chains of the second highest molecular weight and isotacticity show the highest kp value, while those producing polymer of the highest molecular weight and isotacticity show only the second highest kp. On the other hand, the active centers producing polymer with lower\u2013middle chain length show the lowest ethylene incorporation rate.

Category II resulted in activation barriers equally as high as for Category I, if not higher, due to the increased reluctance of the electrophilic metal centre to allow ligands to loosen their metal\u2013ligand bonds for rearrangement.

The developed methodology was found to be applicable for wide variety of 1-alkyl-2-arylaziridines producing the corresponding 5-aryl-2-oxazolidinones with good yields and excellent regioselectivity. The hydroxyl groups present on vicinal carbon of PS-DFILX proved crucial for higher efficiency of catalyst.

The substitution of [B]-SSZ-24 with an aqueous solution of a limited amount of Fe(NO3)3\u00b76H2O effectively gave [Fe]-SSZ-24, and its XRD gave clear patterns of AFI topology without the peaks assigned to Fe2O3. [Fe]-SSZ-24 exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the isopropylation of BP. Shape-selective formation of 4,4\u2032-diisopropylbiphenyl (4,4\u2032-DIPB) occurred at moderate temperatures (250\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C); however, the decreases of the selectivity for 4,4\u2032-DIPB occurred at high temperatures (325\u2013350\u00a0\u00b0C). On the other hand, the selectivities for 4,4\u2032-DIPB in encapsulated products remained almost constant (ca 75%), irrespective of the reaction temperature and the SiO2/Fe2O3 ratios. The differences in the selectivities for 4,4\u2032-DIPB between bulk and encapsulated products indicate that shape-selective formation of 4,4\u2032-DIPB occurs in the [Fe]-SSZ-24 channels, and these channels prevent the isomerization of 4,4\u2032-DIPB, even at 350\u00a0\u00b0C. These results suggest that the channels of SSZ-24 can discriminate 4,4\u2032-DIPB from other possible DIPB isomers at their transition states although high reaction temperatures cause isomerization at external acid sites.Large pore molecular sieves of AFI topology, [Fe]-SSZ-24, [Al]-SSZ-24, MgAPO-5, ZnAPO-5, and SAPO-5, gave similar levels of selectivities for 4,4\u2032-DIPB in the isopropylation of BP. These results indicate that the framework of AFI topology primarily controls shape-selective formation of 4,4\u2032-DIPB, although catalytic activities of the materials were dependent on acidic properties.",

For magnesia supported cobalt catalyst a solid solution was observed at 1173\u00a0K. The most active alumina supported cobalt catalyst is formed upon reduction of the freshly calcined samples at 823\u00a0K in hydrogen. During hydrogen-reduction the supported Co3O4 phase is converted to CoO and cobalt metal at intermediate temperatures and to cobalt metal at 823\u00a0K. Reduced alumina supported cobalt is able to adsorb CO2 as carbonate species; however, silica supported cobalt does not show carbonate species. For magnesia supported cobalt the presence of adsorbed CO2 is not conclusive. The supported cobalt catalysts are active for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction and the conversion depends on the reduction temperature, loading, and support.

     "abstract": "Graphite-like carbon modified TiO2 nanotube array (TNA-G) photocatalysts were synthesized by sucrose graphitization. After the graphite-like carbon hybridization, these photocatalysts showed the enhanced photoelectric catalytic (PEC) activity under ultraviolet irradiation and the obvious PEC degradation activity under visible irradiation (\u03bb\u00a0>\u00a0450\u00a0nm). And the optimum photoresponse was two and three times higher than that of TNA sample under ultraviolet and visible irradiation (\u03bb\u00a0>\u00a0450\u00a0nm) after the Graphite-like carbon hybridization. The total organic carbon results suggested that TNA-G sample could mineralize methylene blue (MB) effectively. The enhancement of PEC activity originated from the synergetic effect between graphite-like carbon layer and TiO2 nanotube array (TNA), which enhanced charge separation process remarkably. The different degradation mechanisms of MB under ultraviolet and visible (\u03bb\u00a0>\u00a0450\u00a0nm) irradiation were suggested. MB II was dominating reactant via the PEC process and MB I was nondominant degraded via the photocatalytic process under ultraviolet irradiation; while the electric energy played a more important role under visible (\u03bb\u00a0>\u00a0450\u00a0nm) irradiation, MB I and II were degraded at the same time without distinction.",

A significant quadratic model (P-value\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9442) was derived using analysis of variance (ANOVA), which was adequate to perform the process variables optimization.

More than 90% of p-NP was experimentally degraded after 10\u00a0h of reaction time under the optimum conditions, which agreed well with the model predictions. The results demonstrated that the degradation of p-NP was due to the attack of hydroxyl radicals (OH) generated by the surface-catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide on the nano-Fe3O4, i.e. heterogeneous Fenton-like reactions. Possible mechanisms of p-NP degradation in this system were proposed, based on intermediates identified by LC\u2013MS and GC\u2013MS and included benzoquinone, hydroquinone, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene and p-nitrocatechol. The kinetic analysis implied that the generation rate of OH (VOH) was increased along with the degradation of p-NP.

SEM and TEM analyses suggested that the replication strategy allowed CeNiAl, CeFe, MnFe and CeFeCo composites to retain the textural and structural properties of the mold. CO2-TPD analysis of the solids revealed that basic sites of medium to high strengths were present in the ternary solids. The textural properties were related to the crystal structure and morphology of the catalysts. Moreover, the reducibility of the solids was highly dependent on their structures. Thus, ternary composites were stabilised by phases with low reducibility, and the activity of the catalysts was enhanced. For instance, CeFeCo possessing a mesostructured feature and a highly stable CoFe2O4 spinel phase showed superior catalytic activity for the production of styrene (conversion\u00a0=\u00a025%; selectivity for styrene\u00a0=\u00a045%) at 550\u00a0\u00b0C.

     "abstract": "The homogeneous production of methyl formate from methanol, syngas, CO and H2 co-catalyzed by Mo(CO)6 in the presence of an alkali methoxide (KOCH3) is reported. A slight increase in the amount of methyl formate produced by the mixture of Mo(CO)6/KOCH3 over the alkali methoxide (KOCH3) alone, is probably due to the electrophilic nature of Mo-coordinated carbon monoxide compared to free carbon monoxide. The mechanism proposed for the production of methyl formate proceeds via a methoxycarbonyl intermediate ([Mo(CO)5(COOCH3)]\u2212), which is then protonated by methanol to eliminate methyl formate. The methoxycarbonyl adduct was shown to play an important role in the formation of methyl formate from the Mo(CO)6/KOCH3 system. The role of this intermediate in the catalytic synthesis of methyl formate from Mo(CO)6/KOCH3/CO/MeOH, Mo(CO)6/KOCH3/syngas/MeOH, Mo(CO)6/KOCH3/H2/MeOH and Mo(CO)6/KOCH3/N2/MeOH is discussed. HP-IR experiments under H2 and N2 atmospheres clearly showed the formation of \u03bc-HMo2(CO)10\u2212 as the methoxycarbonyl intermediate diminishes. The significant role of methanol in the protonation of the methoxycarbonyl adduct is also discussed, as is the effect of polar aprotic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (triglyme) in the catalytic synthesis of methyl formate under CO, H2 and syngas. The amount of methyl formate that is formed is solvent dependent, with methanol showing the highest yield. The stoichiometric effect of Mo(CO)6 to KOCH3 in the production of methyl formate is also reported.",

     "abstract": "Because metal nanoparticles have a high surface area to volume ratio, they can be highly reactive, cost-effective catalysts. However, metallic surfaces are usually too reactive to maintain their metallic character in the presence of oxygen and/or water vapor. Metal nanoparticle catalysts must be handled carefully to avoid oxidation and inactivation. Here, we suggest a facile in situ preparation method for metal nanoparticle catalysts. Copper acetylide and copper methyl-acetylide molecules are based on ionic bonding, and are relatively stable in air. They can be used as a precursor of copper nanoparticles. Due to their instability at increased temperatures, subsequent annealing promotes a segregation reaction into elemental copper and carbon. Transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction revealed that the average diameters of the Cu nanoparticles thus formed were 13.3 and 4.4\u00a0nm for C2Cu2 and CuCC\u2013CH3 precursors, respectively. This suggests that the substitution of acetylide molecules can control the size of the resulting copper nanoparticles. The primary advantage of this preparation method is that the functional acetylide group can reduce copper cations. No additional reducing agent is required, so no further separation process is necessary. This presents in situ preparation process. The catalytic activity of the resulting Cu nanoparticles was confirmed for a hydrogen storage system.",

Using the kinetic model activation energies for hydroformylation of 1-octene to nonanal and 2-methyloctanal were determined. Throughout the concentration ranges studied an approximate first order dependence of the hydroformylation rate on the hydrogen and catalyst concentration was found which indicated that oxidative addition of hydrogen was the rate limiting step. The increase in reaction rate and regioselectivity with an increase in ligand concentration is a striking feature of the catalyst investigated here. At higher concentrations the reaction rate was found to have a strong negative order dependence on the carbon monoxide concentration. The reaction rate had a positive order in 1-octene at a concentration lower than 0.5\u00a0mol\u00a0L\u22121 while saturation kinetics were observed at a higher concentration. The results were explained by invoking the contribution of both monophosphine and diphosphine rhodium species to the hydroformylation catalysis.",

Pd incorporation was carried out in the oxidic phases by using sequential impregnation. The alumina\u2013titania support was formed by anatase\u2013TiO2 crystallites randomly dispersed on \u03b3-Al2O3. Characterization by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy revealed that MoOx species for PdMo supported on alumina\u2013titania displayed larger particles than those in PdNiMo catalysts. HRTEM images showed an increase in order and stacking for MoS2 slabs after Pd addition to NiMo samples, as compared with Mo/AT. Pd incorporation over the NiMo/AT sample increased the reaction rate by 30% while no significant increase was recorded for the PdMo sample. This value corresponds to the most active catalyst and it points out to a promoting effect by Pd. This prominent hydrodesulfurization capacity for the PdNiMo/AT suggests a close interaction of Pd with NiMo. Furthermore, since Pd promoted the HDS activity for a NiMo system, the alumina\u2013titania support played an important role.",

Further increase of WO3 (loadings\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.0\u00a0mmol/100\u00a0m2 TS) results in the formation of crystalline WO3 and they will cover the vanadium oxide species on the surface of the catalysts.

The subsequent steps of CCO coupling with C into CCCO and CCO hydrogenation into CCH2 and CHCH are competitive. Furthermore, CCH from CCH2 and CHCH dehydrogenation can couple with C to form CCCH. Since chain initiation from CO insertion obeys insertion mechanism, and chain propagation from CCH coupling obeys carbide mechanism, both mechanisms are operative and co-operative in Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis. The carburized active surfaces can be regenerated and maintained by CO adsorption on the vacancy site, followed by hydrogenation into surface formyl (CHO) and successive dissociation into surface CH and O.

Especially, Pr6O11 showed the highest yield of 80% at 350\u00a0\u00b0C among the 14 rare earth oxides.

In any case, the catalytic ketonization proceeds over the surface of the oxyacetates and CeO2.

Silyl enol ethers successfully react with acetyl chloride and tert-butyl chloride under dry conditions in the presence of above catalysts to produce the corresponding acylated and alkylated products, respectively. In the case of acetylation reaction, two different nucleophiles with carbon-center (C-atom) and oxygen-center (O-atom) in silyloxy group of silyl enol ether reacts with acetyl chloride to give 1,3-diketone and ketene-ester, respectively. The selectivity for alkylation is always ca. 100% and no side products are formed. Among the various solvents investigated, anhydrous THF was found to be the suitable solvent for alkylation; whereas dichloromethane exhibited high selectivity for diketones for acylation. The formation of nucleophiles from silyl enol ethers appears to be the key step for successful acetylation and tert-butylation by nucleophilic reaction mechanism.

     "abstract": "A series of Cu/ZrO2 catalysts with various La loadings for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation were prepared by a urea\u2013nitrate combustion method. The catalysts were characterized with N2 adsorption, XRD, reactive N2O adsorption, XPS, TPR, H2-TPD and CO2-TPD techniques, and tested for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. With increasing La loading, the Cu surface area increases first and then decreases, whereas the amount of basic site over catalysts increases continuously. The results of catalytic test reveal that a linear relationship exists between the conversion of CO2 and the Cu surface area. Moreover, it is found for the first time that the selectivity to methanol is related to the distribution of basic site on the catalyst surface. The presence of La favors the production of methanol, and the optimum catalytic activity is obtained when the amount of La doping is 5% of the total amount of Cu2+ and Zr4+.",

Each of these highly valuable compounds was obtained in nearly 70% yield using an appropriate polar solvent, whose basicity affected strongly the product distribution. In acetone, a weakly basic solvent, the reaction over heterogeneous sol\u2013gel Sn/SiO2 or Ce/SiO2 catalysts gave mainly trans-sobrerol. No leaching of active components occurs under the reaction conditions and the catalysts can be recovered and reused. On the other hand, in more basic solvent, i.e., dimethylacetamide, the reaction was essentially directed to trans-carveol. Due to the leaching problems with Sn/SiO2 and Ce/SiO2 materials, the synthesis of trans-carveol was performed under homogeneous conditions using CeCl3 or SnCl2 as catalysts with a catalyst turnover number up to ca. 1200. The method represents one of the few examples of the synthesis of isomers from \u03b1-pinene oxide, other than campholenic aldehyde, with a sufficient for practical usage selectivity.",

The cobalt was present in the catalysts predominantly in Co-oxide clusters, whereas the charge of the zeolite framework was balanced by H+ and cationic indium species. The Br\u00f8nsted acid sites promoted the NO-COX reaction; however, the Co-oxide clusters were much more active in this reaction. In absence of indium the catalysts were inactive in the NO-SCR reaction. The NO/NO2 mixture formed in the NO-COX reaction was shown to further react with the InO+/(InOH)2+-zeolite resulting in the simultaneous formation of InNO3 and NO+ species. The Co-oxide clusters increased the rate of NO2 generation and, thereby, the InNO3/NO+ formation. It was substantiated that an N-containing organic intermediate was obtained in the reaction of methane and nitrate group.

For comparison, commercially available Pt/C and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were investigated as well. The Pt/CMK-3 catalysts were more efficient than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Of particular note is that the Pt/CMK-3 catalyst exhibited good stability; only below 0.005% Pt atoms were leached into solution after the chiral hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate in acetic acid, while the Pt leaching amount for the commercial Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/C catalysts was 0.15% and 0.25%, respectively. In addition, the Pt/CMK-3 catalyst could also be reused for more than 5 times without distinct loss of activity and enantioselectivity, while the reusability for the commercial Pt/C and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts was poor. Based on IR and Raman spectroscopic characterization, it is suggested that both the physical structure features, including high specific surface area, adequate pore volume, ordered mesopores and small Pt particle size with high dispersion, and the chemical nature of catalyst surface with high electron density would improve the performance of Pt/CMK-3 catalysts.",

The calculated results indicate that on all of the three surfaces the C\u2013H activation in the methylene group followed by the dehydrogenation of the methyl group is kinetically more favorable. The energy barriers for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation are lowest on the O-terminated surface, but the generated styrene is adsorbed too strongly to be released. As CO2 decomposition and the formation of HCOO are hindered by the relatively high activation energies, CO2 cannot serve as the oxidant to recover the O- and ferryl-terminated surfaces to keep the redox cycle. At the steady state of the reaction the coupling mechanism dominates on the Fe-terminated surface, with the synergistic effect between ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and the reverse water\u2013gas shift reaction.

The structural and physicochemical properties of these nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, DRS, ICP-OES, TEM, XPS, and N2 adsorption\u2013desorption techniques. B doping enlarged the anatase framework, and La doping hindered the crystallization and growth of the mesoporous structure in both singly La-doped and La\u2013B co-doped catalysts. B implantation mainly resulted in visible-light response, whereas overload La2O3 coating worsened visible light absorption, as confirmed by DRS and XPS. XPS and ICP-OES analyses revealed that the B and La content increased approximately by 1.6 and 4.8 times from the interior to the surface of modified TiO2, which dominantly existed in the form of La2O3 and interstitial B structure. The co-doped sample with 1% La and 5% B doping (LA10B50) exhibited maximum photocatalytic activity under visible and solar light compared with the mono-doped samples, which was attributed to synergetic effects, namely, efficient separation of photo-generated carriers by La and response to the extended visible region due to B.

Here we show that methane can be converted into ethane during many hours over two platinum supported catalysts at 370\u00a0\u00b0C. Analysis of the experimental data and DFT calculations, available in the literature, suggests that this reaction proceeds via formation and subsequent coupling of surface carbonaceous species (CHx and C) and that the relatively stable catalyst performance is associated with slow coupling of carbon species. Our work indicates that other transition metal (Co, Fe, Ru, Rh) supported catalysts should be active in methane conversion into ethane at similar and, possibly, lower temperatures. Thus, further research into these catalytic systems would furnish new experimental data on formation and transformation of surface CHx species, which are believed to be involved in such reactions as Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis, methanation and methane steam reforming.",

The coupling of ZnO on the surface of TiO2 retarded the crystal phase transformation from anatase to rutile phase for TiO2 calcined at temperatures higher than 500\u00a0\u00b0C. The specific surface area of ZnO/TiO2 calcined at 700\u00a0\u00b0C was notably higher than that of pure TiO2 possibly because the aggregation and agglomeration of particles were inhibited by the indirect contact of TiO2 particles during the calcination.

ZnO/TiO2 containing 2.0\u00a0mol% ZnO exhibited the lowest photoluminescence emission intensity and the maximum photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) in aqueous solutions due to the enhancement of charge separation by interparticle electron transfer.

The Fe(III) deposited on AC mainly existed in the form of ferrihydrite (FHD) particles which provided the main active sites promoting ozone decomposition. The optimal pH ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 for catalytic ozonation, which corresponded to a nearly neutral surface charge of the catalyst. The apparent rate constant of OMT degradation was almost linearly correlated with the aqueous ozone concentration.

A catalyst that included a methylamino ligand and a ligand-to-Pd molar ratio of 6:1 gave the best performance for the reaction between aryl bromides and phenylboronic acid in toluene.

The interaction between NO and the Pdn clusters is studied on various adsorption sites. Both, NO and Pdn geometrical relaxations are taken into account. The significant conformational reconstruction of the metallic cluster upon NO adsorption induces a large decrease of the NO adsorption energy. Nevertheless, the N\u2013O binding energy is strongly weakened when the molecule is adsorbed on the small Pdn clusters due essentially to an electrostatic repulsion between both N and O atoms. The possible dissociation process of NO on Pd4 cluster is then investigated within two processes: the NO molecule does not dissociate on Pd4 with process (i) (dissociation of the isolated gas phase NO molecule followed by the adsorption of both nitrogen and oxygen atoms on the cluster). Process (ii) which presents three successive steps (adsorption of the NO molecule, dissociation of the NO molecule adsorbed on Pd4, adsorption of the O atom on the cluster) is studied in details and we propose a reaction pathway locating transition states and intermediate species. The activation energy for process (ii) is high and the dissociation of the NO molecule on the Pd4 cluster is thus highly improbable.",

Having more efficient routes to the synthesis of this compound would be advantageous to the wide-spread use of this fine chemical. In this work, the effects of adding strongly interacting oxides (ZnO, CeO2, and ZrO2) to PdO catalysts supported on high surface area n-Al2O3(+), n-MgO, and n-TiO2 prepared via co- and sequential precipitation were investigated. The product yields obtained from these catalysts in the oxidative coupling of 4-methylpyridine are dependent on the additive, the support, and preparation method. Evidently, these are complex catalytic systems in that the PdO\u2013additive and PdO\u2013support interactions must be right to promote product formation while preventing palladium leaching and support or additive migration over the active Pd/PdO sites. Although PdO/n-ZnO catalysts are reasonably active in the coupling reaction, ZnO addition to PdO catalysts supported on n-Al2O3(+), n-MgO, or n-TiO2 does not increase the yield in any case. CeO2 and ZrO2 can increase the product yields in the reaction depending on the support used. Due to strong PdO\u2013CeO2 interactions, the addition of CeO2 in some cases results in CeOx-migration and coverage of active PdO species or disrupts favorable PdO\u2013support interactions leading to Pd leaching. Therefore, ZrO2 is the better additive with co-precipitated PdO/ZrO2/n-Al2O3(+) consistently producing yields in excess of 3.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0g/g catalyst which is 36% higher than the 2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16\u00a0g/g catalyst obtained from the PdO/n-Al2O3(+) (5\u00a0wt% Pd), the best catalyst previously reported for this reaction.",

The olefin insertion step has subsequently been investigated in terms of its regioselectivity for three different ligands, i.e., the PH3, PMe3 and the N-heterocyclic carbene ligand IMe. The activation barriers for the IMe ligands are mostly found to be lower than those for phosphine ligands, indicating a higher catalytic activity of carbene complexes in butene dimerization. The computed relative transition state energies suggest that the PMe3 and IMe ligands kinetically favor butene insertion into the primary Ni-butyl bonds, which leads to linear and singly branched C8 products.

The effects of several factors on the sonocatalytic damage of BSA molecules were evaluated by means of UV\u2013vis and fluorescence spectra. It was found that the damage degree was aggravated with the increase of ultrasonic irradiation time, ultrasonic irradiation power, TiO2/HA addition amount, solution acidity and ionic strength. The damage site to BSA molecules was also studied using synchronous fluorescence technology. It was observed that the damage site was mainly focused on the tyrosine (Tyr) residue of BSA molecule.

Characterization is done on the precursor solutions, on the dried catalyst precursors and on the calcined catalysts (ICP-AES, N2-physisorption, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS and 27Al MAS NMR). Firstly, oxalic acid is used as an additive with the objective to perturb the Mo speciation in the AHM impregnation solution. It affects the catalysts texture and impedes the formation of Al2(MoO4)3. Samples are totally amorphous and outcompete the reference samples prepared with AHM. Secondly, a molybdenum oxide hydrates solution is used as impregnation solution. The MoO3 phase formed is also totally amorphous, the texture is preserved, the spreading of the Mo phase is enhanced and the activity is high. However, at high Mo loading the build-up of Al2(MoO4)3 provokes a decrease in activity.",

Their performance as additives to a commercial equilibrium USY FCC catalyst for VGO (vacuum gas oil) cracking and activity in oxidative adsorption of SO2 under similar FCC regenerator conditions were investigated. The bottleneck of the novel bifunctional additives is that the substitution of MgAl2O4 for Kaolin clay in propylene additives causes the migration of Mg2+ into ZSM-5 zeolite, which evidently lowers the activity of ZSM-5 as an FCC additive. However, pretreating MgAl2O4 with phosphoric acid either by extraction or by impregnation method which weakened the interaction between MgAl2O4 and ZSM-5 during the steaming and calcination processes, respectively, was proved to be effective in enhancing the efficiency of ZSM-5 for increasing propylene yield. Concurrently, the unusally high hydrogen transfer activity of MgAl2O4 in VGO cracking, which also contributed to the decrease in ZSM-5 activity, was sharply reduced by P doping.

The effects of different DNOC initial concentrations, pH values and nano-magnetite quantities on the degradation rate of DNOC were also examined. The results showed that a lower DNOC initial concentration and a lower pH led to faster degradation of DNOC. It was also observed that the amount of nano-magnetite affected the degradation rate at lower pH while having no influence at neutral pH. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions in the system were investigated. The homogeneous reaction dominated at a lower pH; direct electrolysis appears to take place at neutral pH; and a contribution from a heterogeneous reaction was not obvious under the experimental conditions studied. A model was developed to describe the degradation mechanism at low pH conditions, and the model matched experimental data very well.

From H2-TPR, DRS, Raman and XPS spectroscopies, it is concluded that Cr ions and Cr(III) oxide coexist. TEM/EDX results confirmed that chromium oxide species are either heterogeneously or homogeneously dispersed on the support, depending on the nature of the precursor. DRIFT showed that chromium exchange leads strictly to the consumption of Si\u2013O+H\u2013Al groups. The catalyst prepared from chromium chloride showed higher activity and selectivity towards acetonitrile, being this catalytic modification probably due to the differentiated nature of chromium species formed using this precursor.

The isoelectric point determined experimentally was 8.0, differing from that obtained by titration (6.4), which indicated the presence of fixed positive charges in disubstituted imidazole units. The XPS N 1s signal for pyridinic nitrogen in the imidazole units, and the O 1s signals from the carbonyl, hydroxyl and carboxylate groups shifted to higher binding energies after copper uptake, proving the chemical nature of Cu(II) adsorption on the polyampholyte. The XPS spectrum of the complex showed a Cu 2p3/2 peak at 934.7\u00a0eV and the characteristic shake-up satellite of Cu(II). When the complex was used as a heterogeneous catalyst for H2O2 activation, Cu(I) was proved to be a probable intermediate species and contributed to elucidate the mechanism. The Auger CuLMM spectrum supports the presence of Cu(I) with a kinetic energy value of 914.8\u00a0eV.

The uncatalyzed addition occurs at \u03b2-carbon via a process which involves C\u2013S bond formation and proton transfer from S to \u03b3-carbon. The \u03b2-thioester is generated. In TangPhos-catalyzed case, the nucleophilic thiol attacks \u03b3-carbon after the addition of TangPhos to \u03b2-carbon. The proton transfers firstly from P of TangPhos to carbonyl O and then to \u03b2-carbon. The \u03b3-thioester is obtained. Step1 is rate-limiting. As nucleophilic catalyst, P2 forms strong covalent bond with \u03b2-carbon which shifts the positive charge of C2, leaving C3 as the electrophilic center for \u03b3 addition. The regioselectivity is consequently altered. As Lewis base, P1 deprotonates thiol enhancing the nucleophility of S and facilitates the proton transfer to \u03b2-carbon as a medium. Among four competitive pathways, ER path is the most favorable one with smallest rotation of the single bond linking two chiral rings in TangPhos. The primary domination on enantioselectivity of chiral rings is assisted by t-butyl group, which also prefers ER path with the least steric hindrance. Our conclusion is supported by NBO analysis and the predicted ee values according to the experiment.",

When the manganese cubane cluster [Mn4O4L6]+, (L\u00a0=\u00a0(p-MeO-Ph)2PO2), 1+, is incorporated within a Nafion membrane deposited on an electrolytic anode that is poised at 1.00\u00a0V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and illuminated with light, catalysis of only water oxidation is observed in aqueous solutions of sodium chloride, including seawater. No chlorine formation can be detected. This effect is comparable to the ability of the PSII-WOC in marine and hypersaline organisms to catalyze, exclusively, water oxidation with chloride present within the WOC as an essential cofactor for activity. It stands in clear contrast to commercial water electrolyzers which generate chlorine gas at their anodes when filled with seawater. Investigations suggest that this effect originates largely in electrostatic repulsion of anionic chloride ions by the Nafion support. In this respect it also appears similar to the PSII-WOC, which harnesses a proteinaceous, proton-conducting environment with high cation affinity in its active site. Solar seawater electrolysis of this type offers a potentially unlimited source of clean hydrogen fuel for a future, pollution-free economy.",

In Ti-HAP, Ti 3d orbital hybridized with O 2p orbital and formed an internal state in the HAP band gap. It caused absorption-edge lowering of Ti-HAP.

All catalytic reactions are carried out under mild conditions (90\u2013130\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.86\u20132.17\u00a0MPa) in the absence of organic solvents. The effects of texture properties of the PVIm matrix, molecular compositions of the ionic liquid moieties, and catalytic reaction parameters (reaction temperature, pressure, and time) on the catalytic reactivity of cycloaddition reactions were systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that grafted ionic liquids with more nucleophilic anions, bulkier alkyl chains, or hydroxyl groups improve reactivity. Additionally, the incorporation of small amount of ethanol or water into the reaction system could significantly increase reactivity. In addition, textural properties of the polymer matrix (pore size and specific surface area) affected the catalytic reactions. The obtained PVIm-RX heterogeneous catalysts exhibited higher turnover number than those reported for ionic liquids grafted onto porous silica.",

This paper presents the results of the antibacterial activity of Nb\u2013aluminum oxide, designated MAC\u2013Nb5+, prepared by the non-hydrolytic sol\u2013gel route. The resulting material MAC\u2013Nb5+ was characterized by several techniques including X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, infrared absorption spectroscopy, differential pulse voltammetry, surface area measurements, and scanning electron microscopy. The displacements of the bands due to Al\u2013O and Al\u2013OH in the infrared spectra of MAC\u2013Nb5+ in relation to alumina confirmed the coordination of Nb5+ ions to the surface and inside the pores of the alumina matrix. The powder XRD of MAC\u2013Nb5+ suggested that the material is amorphous and that the niobium oxide is well-dispersed over the alumina matrix. Differential pulse voltammetry revealed the redox process that involves Nb\u2013O\u2013Al. Results from the biological assays for determination of the antibacterial activity of MAC\u2013Nb5+ were obtained by the following methodologies: determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and antibacterial activity assay by agar diffusion. It was observed that MAC\u2013Nb5+ displays antibacterial activity against all the tested bacteria.",

The in situ generated and the isolated (defined) chloro-iron(II)-terpyridine\u2013pyridine carboxylate [Fe(tpy)(pic)Cl] catalyst system has been developed and its catalytic function was invented for the degradation process. The different nitrogenous and oxygen ligands have been screened out for the development of best catalyst system, and eventually we explored pyridine 2-carboxylic acid and terpyridine ligands together, were found to be the best. Notably, the in situ generated and the defined catalyst systems have found to be more effective with similar catalytic activities towards the oxidative degradation of both the dyes. As a result, the whole oxidative degradation process has been carried out with Fe(tpy)(pic)Cl catalyst system and the general process utilizes the efficient catalytic method for the selective oxidation of \u2013NN\u2013 and \u2013CC\u2013 bonds of azo and indigo dyes respectively.

A common oxidative degradation mechanism which operates in both the dyes has been proposed and an identical related kinetic model was designed. The main interesting aspect of the present work pertains to the catalytic conversion of environmentally hazardous compounds into useful molecules; such are anthranilic acids and nitrobenzenes. Other special aspect related to catalytic activity of iron and potentially, iron catalyst accelerates the reaction rates with 15\u201320-fold faster. The reactions were also carried out with different polymer supported trihalide and inter-halide reagents. Notably, trichloride and inter-halide regents were found to be more reactive.

Among the various metallosilicates studied for the oxidation of tetrahydrofuran to \u03b3-butyrolactone, titanosilicates exhibited the best activity than the other metallosilicates such as chromium silicalite-1 (CrS-1), chromium silicalite-2 (CrS-2) and vanadium silicalite-1 (VS-1). The intrinsic activity of TS-1 was found to be marginally higher than the other titanosilicates. Cyclic ethers undergo \u03b1C\u2013H oxidation to give the corresponding lactones; whereas open-chain ether produce carboxylic acids by initial \u03b1C\u2013H bond oxidation to give ester as an intermediate product, which further undergoes cleavage of \u2013O\u2013 linkage to give the final carboxylic acids.

The catalysts compounds employed were the oxodiperoxomolybdenum complexes of several pyridine, 2,2\u2032-bipyridine and pyrazole ligands with apolar functions (alkyl chains, alkyl-trimethylsilyl groups and polydimethylsiloxanyl polymer), which showed enhanced solubility in relatively apolar organic media. Both the isolated complexes and in situ preparations were catalytically active. The solubility of the new catalyst complexes appears to facilitate the catalytic activity in these systems, since activity was not observed for the analogous, insoluble complexes of unfunctionalised ligands. In these systems, the oxidant, aqueous hydrogen peroxide, forms a separate phase and the catalyst resides in the organic phase. From a green chemistry and economic perspective the elimination of organic solvents and co-catalysts from a reaction system would present advantages and, consequently, the epoxidation reaction was also investigated under solventless conditions. The 3-hexyl-5-methylpyrazole and 3-hexyl-5-heptylpyrazole complexes were found to show heightened activities, the latter being particularly efficient in these conditions, whilst bipyridines apparently inhibit the epoxidation. In addition, the mechanism of the epoxidation reaction was studied through DFT calculations for the model olefin substrate ethylene with the oxodiperoxomolybdenum complex of 3-hexyl-5-heptylpyrazole. The oxo-transfer reaction occurred by interaction of the ethylene with the peroxo ligand via the spirocyclic transition state proposed by Sharpless.",

The catalyst (molar ratio of Cu:Ce:Al\u00a0=\u00a01:1:2) showed better catalytic performance, in which both the conversion of MA and the selectivity of GBL kept 100% within two hours under the reaction conditions of 6\u00a0mL catalyst, 0.1\u00a0MPa, 220\u2013280\u00a0\u00b0C, 30\u00a0mL\u00a0min\u22121 H2, 0.6\u00a0h\u22121 LHSV of 20\u00a0wt.% MA/GBL. As for Cu\u2013CeO2\u2013Al2O3 catalyst, smaller crystallite size of Cu and higher Cu surface area are favorable to increase its catalytic performance. The deactivation of Cu\u2013CeO2\u2013Al2O3 catalyst is due to formation of the compact wax-like deposition on the catalyst surface, which is probably ascribed to the strong adsorption of succinic anhydride and then polymerization on the catalyst surface. The catalytic performance of the regenerated catalyst can be recovered completely by the regeneration method of N2\u2013air\u2013H2 stage treatment.",

Reported here is the hydrocarbon chlorination promoted by manganese and iron complexes with methylated derivatives of bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (bispicen). The reactions between these coordination compounds and meta-chloroperbenzoic acid generate oxidants capable of oxidizing weak C\u2013H bonds to C\u2013Cl bonds. This chemistry is regioselective, with a strong preference for activating C\u2013H bonds on secondary carbons over weaker C\u2013H bonds on tertiary carbons. The reactivity is consistent with the methyl groups on the ligands preventing more sterically encumbered substrates from accessing the reactive portions of a [MIV(LMen)(O)Cl2] oxidant. The iron compounds promote more hydrocarbon chlorination than their manganese analogs.",

These changes were not gradual; a kind of transition zone with huge changes in product distribution between catalysts with 15 and 25% Si/(Si\u00a0+\u00a0Al) was observed. This was explained by an increment in the density and strength of Br\u00f6nsted sites. These Br\u00f6nsted sites compete with the CUS sites of Mo promoted by Co for reactant adsorption.

Characteristic for the composite films is an enhanced optical absorption in the visible range. The presence of the carbon film causes a shift of the TiO2 absorption edge and modifies its grain size to be smaller.

The catalytic activity of the V-based materials in the epoxidation of simple alkenes and allylic alcohols was assessed. Upon reuse, both materials show no significant decrease in their catalytic properties.",

Aggregation of Au particles was excluded from origins of deactivation by TEM. Carbonate-like species formed on gold in the presence of CO2 and H2 were detected by in situ IR spectroscopy. The results of XPS and DR-UV/Vis reveal that the active species of Au0 was oxidized in the presence of CO2. The possible formation of CO and its influence on the activity of Au/TiO2 were also discussed. Accordingly, the formation of carbonates, the oxidation of surface Au0 by CO2, and the CO formation are proposed to be the possible factors for the deactivation of Au/TiO2.",

     "abstract": "Palladium catalysts supported on various metal oxides were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate why these catalysts do not show any correlation between the measured Pd surface area and the catalytic activity for the oxidative coupling of 4-methylpyridine to 4,4\u2032-dimethyl-2,2\u2032-bipyridine.The XPS data confirm the classification of n-Al2O3(+), n-MgO and p-SiO2 as non-interacting supports, since the Pd 3d5/2 binding energy (BE) of palladium on these supports is 336.1\u00a0eV, consistent with bulk PdO. In contrast, catalysts supported on p-TiO2, n-ZnO, n-ZrO2, n-ZrO2(CeO2), and n-CeO2 have Pd 3d5/2 BEs ranging from 336.3 to 337.4\u00a0eV, which reveal varying degrees of metal-support interactions. Metal support interactions leading to electron deficient Pd2+ species are likely beneficial for the reaction due to a facilitated C\u2013H insertion step.While both the PdO/p-TiO2 and PdO/n-TiO2 catalysts have a Pd 3d BE of 336.3\u00a0eV, their differences in activity can be attributed to (1) the PdO/n-TiO2 catalyst as prepared having a significantly higher number of hydroxyl groups on the surface compared with the PdO/p-TiO2 catalyst, and (2) the p-TiO2 support being crystalline with an anatase phase, while the n-TiO2 support is nearly amorphous. The presence of surface hydroxyl groups before reaction could hinder the first C\u2013H activation step, and an anatase phase of the support can result in more favorable palladium-support interactions compared with an amorphous TiO2. The XPS data also indicates that while Pd-support interactions are beneficial, very strong interactions, such as in the case of CeO2, can lead to migration of the support over Pd, which reduces the Pd surface area and explains the lower than expected activity of the PdO/n-CeO2 catalyst.On some supports in this study leaching may occur during the reaction, but the characterization data indicate that other factors of catalyst deactivation are more important. XRD reveals that the complete reduction of the PdO particles on the surface is very fast compared to the reaction time. This observation explains why reducible supports with mobile oxygen are beneficial in this reaction. These supports can facilitate the reoxidation of palladium due to strong metal-support interactions. Migration of the support over the active palladium species is another deactivation pathway that appears to be more severe than leaching on these catalysts.",

It was found that the ion exchange reaction between Cl\u2212 and WO42\u2212 ions was preferable to occur on the surface of Ag8W4O16 nanorods rather than in the bulk solution, resulting in the formation of core\u2013shell nanorods. The AgCl shell layer could be easily controlled by adjusting the concentration of NaCl solution. With increasing NaCl concentration, more Ag8W4O16 phase in the core transferred into AgCl-nanoparticle shell layer while the total size of the core\u2013shell nanorods almost remained unchanged. The photocatalytic activity experiments of methyl orange aqueous solution under fluorescence light irradiation indicated that the AgCl nanoparticles coated on the surface of Ag8W4O16 nanorods, which could be readily separated from a slurry system after photocatalytic reaction, exhibited a much higher photocatalytic activity than the bulk AgCl photocatalyst.",

This copper(III) compound catalyses the reduction of molecular oxygen by l-ascorbic acid at pH 7.97, in Tris\u2013HCl buffer solution at the ionic strength of 0.1\u00a0M (NaCl). Stoichiometry of the reaction (2:1.07 for l-ascorbic acid:dioxygen) indicates formation of water and dehydroascorbic acid as primary products.

Rotational energy profiles for the approach of 2,2-dimethyl-2H-chromene to the active site of (salen)Mn were mapped for the homogeneous catalyst and the catalyst immobilized as a linker in a MOF. The model corroborated that the Re enantioface is favored by the homogeneous catalyst. It was shown that the predicted enantioselectivity when chromene approaches the more accessible (salen)Mn in the MOF is highly sensitive to the distance between the (salen)Mn linkers of the interpenetrated frameworks. Calculated rotational energy profiles for a hypothetical non-interpenetrated MOF revealed that this MOF catalyst should exhibit enantioselectivity intermediate to the interpenetrated MOF and the homogeneous catalyst. Finally, the continuous chirality measure of the catalyst was found to correlate well with the energy of the homogeneous catalyst\u2013reactant complex, suggesting that high chirality content is related to high enantioselectivity. This correlation, however, did not apply for some of the MOF catalysts.

In this paper, we have suggested a possible mechanism of the title reaction and then theoretically investigated it in detail using density functional theory (DFT). Fully optimized geometries of reactants, products, transition states and intermediates were obtained at the B3LYP/[6-31G (d, p)/LANL2DZ] level of theory, and the results revealed that this reaction had three steps. Our calculated results indicate that the [2\u00a0+\u00a02] cycloaddition step is the enantioselectivity-determining step. Moreover, the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis has been carried out to explain why the NHC catalysts can make the [2\u00a0+\u00a02] cycloaddition easier to occur, which is mainly due to that the energy gap of FMOs become narrower under the NHC-catalysis condition. Noteworthy, the results of global reactivity indexes analysis are consistent with those of the FMO analysis. Further calculations show that the solvent effect of dichloromethane has no great influence on enantioselectivity of this reaction.",

The resulting polymers showed c.a. 62% of trans-polyNBE, determined by 1H NMR, and Tg\u00a0=\u00a032\u00a0\u00b0C, determined by DSC and DMTA. For ROMP of NBD, 1 showed quantitative yield with PDI\u00a0=\u00a02.62 when [NBD]/[Ru]\u00a0=\u00a05000 for 20\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas the reaction with 2 reached 55% with PDI\u00a0=\u00a02.16 in the same conditions. It is concluded that the presence of the two methyl groups in the piperidine ring provides an increase in the induction period to produce the Ru-carbene species justifying better polyNBE results with 2, and a greater amine \u27f6 \u03c3 Ru \u27f6 \u03c0 monomer synergism which contributed to the best activation of less tensioned olefin as NBD.",

To test the asymmetric property of this surface by conformational analysis of adsorbed (R)- and (S)-2-butanol was investigated. Computed conformational analysis indicates that the (S)-isomer bond with the surface is stronger than the (R)-isomer. Steric interactions between adsorbed alcohol and catalyst surface appear to be more important than intramolecular steric constraints present within the alcohol conformations. Mulliken atomic charges predict that selected basic sites (Oa\u2013h) play a major role in elimination reactions. E2 elimination with synclinal transition state was comparable with E2 antiperiplanar transition state. The activation energy for elimination of a \u03b2-hydrogen from the 2-butanol conformers increases with increasing the distance between \u03b2-hydrogen and basic sites.

Results were compared with those from Pt samples prepared by a conventional impregnation technique.

A similar trend but to a lesser extent was observed on the Pt/titania series. These results were rationalized on the basis of the different distribution of Pt particles on the support, catalysts prepared by impregnation exhibiting both local massive Pt aggregates and very small Pt particles, samples prepared by photo-deposition showing instead Pt nanoparticles with a homogeneous and narrow size distribution, with diameters in the range of 1.6\u20132\u00a0nm, regarded as appropriate for the deep oxidation of volatile organic compounds.",

An Ames assay of the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 was employed to evaluate the mutagenicity of toluidine and its gaseous photocatalytic degradation intermediates. With or without rat liver microsomal fraction (S9 mix) activation, neither toluidine nor its gaseous intermediates presented mutagenic activity against strains TA98 (\u00b1S9) and TA100 (\u2212S9) at all tested doses. Toluidine, however, can induce a weak positive response to the TA100 strain with an S9 mix at doses as high as 4000\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0plate\u22121. An increase of revertants per plate was obtained after 30\u00a0min photocatalysis in the TA100 strain with S9 mix. As reaction time further increased, photocatalytic technology exhibited the ability to completely and efficiently detoxify toluidine. Both our chemical analysis and toxic evaluation indicate that all mutagenic intermediates in the gas can be completely eliminated within 240\u00a0min, which further suggests that photocatalytic technology is an effective approach for degrading aromatic amines.",

HMR has three stereochemical centres and naturally exists as a mixture of two diastereoisomers, namely RRR-HMR and SRR-HMR. The latter is significantly more reactive than the former, in the reaction above. In order to elucidate the hydrogenolysis mechanism, simple surface events involving HMR derivatives on aluminated faujasite (H-Y) fragments were simulated by quantum chemical calculations. The metallic function of a Pd/H-Y acidic catalyst was also mimicked by a minimal palladium cluster. Stereochemical evidences pointed already out that water \u03b2-elimination on the epimeric centre, leading to an olefinic intermediate, should mainly occur for the adsorbed SRR-HMR stereoisomer. As a consequence, it was hypothesized that this feature could explain the different reactivity of the RRR-HMR and SRR-HMR hydrogenolysis, occurring on metal supported bi-functional zeolite catalysts. The significance of this inference is decreased by the here study. Finally, it is demonstrated that several HMR to MAT reaction paths may coexist and that the metal component of the Pd/H-Y bi-functional catalyst cannot be involved in steps discriminating for the whole reaction rate and selectivity.",

A lower pKa indicates easier deprotonation of the alkoxide group, which participates more effectively in the reaction and the 2-OH-33R8 functionalized ionene acts as a specially effective catalytic homogeneous nanoreactor.",

The catalytic performance of the modified phenylene-silica was evaluated in the oxidation of cis-cyclooctene at 55\u00a0\u00b0C with tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant and DCE as the co-solvent. The main product was the epoxide, formed in 83% yield after 24\u00a0h, with 2-cycloocten-1-one being the main by-product. Although the activity of the catalyst decreased after the first recycle, possibly due to partial chromium leaching, it remained nearly the same thereafter, and leaching tests indicated that the catalytic reaction was essentially heterogeneous in nature. Tests carried out using a radical scavenger indicated that the reaction of the olefin with TBHP may involve both free radical and non-radical reaction mechanisms.",

The catalyst structure and redox properties were investigated by means of X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and H2-TPR techniques. Results indicate that the Bi promotive effect can be attributed to two possible reasons. One is that the Bi component promotes the dispersal of MoO3. The isolation effect results in acrolein selectivity increase. Another reason is that Bi doping enhances lattice oxygen diffusion and increases the amount of surface active oxygen, which is responsible for the oxidation of intermediate propylene to acrolein.",

Artificial neural networks possess the ability to \u201clearn\u201d from a set of experimental data (e.g. processing conditions and corresponding responses) without actual knowledge of the physical and chemical laws that govern the system. Therefore, ANNs application in data treatment is especially important where systems present nonlinearities and complex behavior.

Due to the complexity of reactions in AOPs, the effect of different operational parameters involved are very difficult to determine, leading to uncertainties in the design and scale-up of chemical reactors of industrial interest. It is evident that this problem can not be solved by simple linear multivariate correlation. Artificial neural networks are a promising alternative modeling technique.

The vinyl polymerization of norbornene (NB) in the ionic liquid N-butyl-N-trimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BtMA+NTf2\u2212) with [Pd(NCCH3)4](BF4)2 led to soluble polynorbornenes (with several hundred monomer units) at different temperatures and molar NB:Pd ratios. The norbornene derivative 5-vinyl-2-norbornene (VNB) was oligomerized in high yield with 1 in CH3NO2 primarily through the (endocyclic) norbornene double bond but also through both the norbornene and (exocyclic) vinyl double bond for about every second monomer (by 1H NMR). A 2D 1H,13C-HSQC NMR analysis suggests a \u03b2-hydrogen elimination after insertion of a norbornene double bond as chain-termination mechanism. The conversion of NB or VNB increased with temperature and a lower NB:Pd and VNB:Pd ratio, respectively. The vinyl double bond in VNB slowed down the insertion rate drastically when compared with NB (activity decrease by a factor of 102).",

     "abstract": "[RuCp(PP)]+ complexes active for allylation of alcohols with allyl alcohol as the allylating agent were immobilized on solid supports. Two different immobilization methods have been applied: (1) via electrostatic interactions of the cationic complex on ion-exchange resins, where the anion is present on the support and (2) via a coordination bond with a ligand covalently-bound on the support. Both methods give high yields of immobilized complex through relatively simple procedures. The catalysts immobilized via ionic interactions prove to be able to allylate both 1-octanol and 4-tert-butylphenol with very low leaching of the catalyst, thus forming allyl octyl ether and C-allylated phenol, respectively. The accumulation of water in the highly hydrophilic resin precludes the O-allylation of phenol and also retards the C-allylation reaction. The catalysts immobilized via a coordination bond are not hydrophilic; with these catalysts selective O-allylation of phenols is achieved, with recycling of the catalysts over multiple runs. Leaching of the catalyst from the support is somewhat higher than for the electrostatically-bound catalyst and quarternisation (allylation) of the excess of phosphine groups present on the support plays an important role in the activity of the immobilized catalysts for the allylation reaction.",

In this work, this green synthesis route was further investigated by the combination of experimental and theoretical methods. The obtained catalyst was named as PS catalyst based on the incomplete conversion of Phillips catalyst to S-2 catalyst. Polymerization activity of PS1.5 catalyst was higher than that of S-2 catalyst with either TEA or MAO as cocatalyst. The existence of the simultaneously formed hydroxyl group and its coordination to the reduced Cr site was favorable to the PS catalyst, and this might attribute to the higher polymerization activity of PS catalyst than that of S-2 catalyst. A further modification of PS catalyst by a series of alkyl chlorosilane compounds showed that the role of the electron-withdrawing group only limited at a certain distance away from Cr active site. This preliminary study provided a solid basis for a further innovation of PS catalysts and final substitution of S-2 catalyst in commercial processes.",

Moreover we also present pathways for the formation of methane and water, which are considered to be the major by-products in the syngas conversion. Our results demonstrate that the formation of the C1 oxygenates takes place via the hydrogenation of the adsorbed CO molecule while the formation of C2 oxygenates proceeds in two steps, i.e. CO dissociation to produce CHx species followed by CO and/or HCO insertion.An analysis obtained from the present calculations reveals that the product formation on Rh6 cluster depends upon the CO:H2 coverage. Under hydrogen rich conditions, the products will mainly consist of CH3OH, CH4 and water. The kinetic analysis based on rate constants obtained from harmonic transition state theory indicates that the initial step of CO hydrogenation is the rate-limiting step. Moreover, results suggest that the CO dissociation and the insertion steps for the formation of C2 oxygenates on Rh6 cluster have lower barriers compared to that on the Rh(1\u00a01\u00a01) surface.",

The whole process is divided into two stages: the initiation of Mo\u2013carbene species from Mo-oxo precursors and the propagating process by these active sites to yield propylene. The formation of initial Mo\u2013carbene takes place via the endothermic addition and the subsequent decomposition of the oxametallacyclobutane intermediate. In the propagating stage to yield the final products, MoCHCH3 firstly reacts with ethylene to form MoCH2, which would further react with 2-butylene to give another propylene molecule. The oxidation states of the Mo species have great influences on the reactivities associated with these two stages. It is unfavorable for MoIV-oxo precursors to produce Mo\u2013alkylidene species compared with MoVI and MoV sites. The energy barriers indicate that the MoVI and MoV\u2013alkylidene species could catalyze the olefin metathesis reaction, but MoV ones are more preferred to be the active sites.

The results obtained evidence a crucial influence of the ratio of the anchoring groups to palladium (N/Pd): a higher excess of coordinating groups in the catalysts results in a higher catalytic activity, probably because such supports aid the deposition of the metal onto the support and, simultaneously, prevent aggregation of the \u2018active\u2019 metal species at high reaction temperatures.

After the reaction, the presence of Rh\u2013Rh contribution with average bond distance of 2.68\u00a0\u00c5 and coordination number of 1.3 and the missing contribution with bond distance of 3.85\u00a0\u00c5 suggest that the reaction induces the coalescence of Rh complex to form dimeric Rh species. However, formation of trace amount of Rh metal clusters cannot be ruled out because rather small characteristic peak for the missing Rh\u2013Rh shell may be covered by noise.",

     "abstract": "The Lewis acidic nature and reactivity of two industrially important catalysts, viz., Sn and Ti substituted beta zeolite (T-BEA) are analyzed using a unique combination of structural parameters, energetics and reactivity descriptors. To achieve this purpose, we adsorb the industrially important moieties (L) namely NH3, H2O, CH3OH, CH3CN on the active sites of T-BEA. The calculations were performed using a periodic density functional method where the valence electrons are described using a plane wave basis set in conjunction with pseudo-potentials for the core electrons. The analysis of the structural properties of these complexes reveals that TO4 shows typical characteristic splitting 120\u00b0/90\u00b0, close to bipyramidal geometry as compared to tetrahedral symmetry observed in the bare T-BEA. This is associated with small variations in the framework bond lengths (\u22650.08\u00a0\u00c5) and a substantially large variation of bond angles (\u226410\u00b0) in all the ligand-zeolite complexes. Further in both cases of Sn and Ti substituted beta zeolite, ligand interacts at optimum inter-atomic bond distance. Our interaction energies show that adsorption of all ligand moieties is stronger at Sn center than that of Ti. In general, the order of stability of the different T-BEA adducts is NH3\u00a0>\u00a0H2O\u00a0>\u00a0CH3OH\u00a0>\u00a0CH3CN. The ligand interaction is associated with the corresponding bond elongation and bond reduction of the adsorbed molecules on catalyst active site, which can be taken as measure of red or blue shifted frequencies. Finally, the global descriptors of reactivity justify the fact that soft acid, Sn-BEA, interacts strongly with soft bases following the Pearson's HSAB principle. However, hard acid, Ti-BEA interacts with soft bases to form a stable Lewis adduct. Furthermore, the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of all Sn-BEA\u2013L adducts is lower than that of Ti-BEA\u2013L adducts indicating to its higher Lewis acidic nature compared to Ti-BEA.",

Over the past few years, there has been an enormous amount of research with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as an effective method of wastewater treatment. Among AOPs, heterogeneous photocatalytic process using TiO2 nanomaterials appears as the most emerging destructive technology due to its cost effectiveness and the catalyst inert nature and photostability. This review deals with the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes containing different functionalities using TiO2 nanomaterials in aqueous solution. It first discusses the photocatalytic properties of nanostructured TiO2. The photocatalytic degradation rate strongly depends on the basic structure of the molecule and the nature of auxiliary groups attached to the aromatic nuclei of the dyes. So, this review then explains the influence of structure of dyes on their photocatalytic degradation rates. The influences of different substitutes such as alkyl side chains, methyl, nitrate, hydroxyl and carboxylic groups as well as the presence of chloro atom have been discussed in detail.",

Whereas the reaction with hydrogen of C-2-OL in ethanol solutions yields hydrogenated products through a complex network, and no reaction takes place in the absence of hydrogen, in the present case C-2-OL is converted first to 2,5-dihydrofuran (2,5-DHF) and water.

Besides bulk iron carbide, several carbon species with different cluster sizes exist in the carburized catalysts, which have different reactivities towards hydrogen. The surface atomic carbon, the oligomerized carbon species and the bulk iron carbide are more reactive to hydrogen, whereas the large-size amorphous carbons are relatively inert to hydrogen.

The \u03c1+ values are negative and decrease with increase in temperature. From the intersection of the lines in the Hammett and Arrhenius plots, the isokinetic relationship is discussed. The mechanistic pathway involving the cyclic oxidant\u2013substrate\u2013catalyst ternary complex is proposed, wherein the oxidation state of V(IV) is unaltered. The reaction is an example of the neighboring group participation and intramolecular catalysis.",

The kinetics of formation of 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethyl-4,4\u2032-diphenoquinone (DPQ) was studied. The kinetic parameters k2 and Km were obtained at pH 7.01. L1Cu displayed better catalytic activity than L2Cu in mentioned above systems. For L1Cu catalyzed systems, the cationic surfactant CTAB, 12-2-12 and 16-2-16 micellar media accelerated the oxidation of DMP. And the TX-100 and SDBS micelles showed little effect on reaction rate compared with the buffer solution. For the L2Cu catalyzed systems, these surfactants all inhibited the oxidation of DMP, and especially, the oxidation of DMP was not found in SDBS micellar solution in the catalyzed system at pH 7.01 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Micelles showed great influence on the yield of product and the selectivity of PPO. Under this work's conditions, DPQ was easily generated in aqueous solution, while PPO was remarkably promoted in micellar media, especially in SDBS micellar solution. As a green technology process, one outstanding advantage of this catalyzed system was that the products of polymer can be easily separated from the solution and the catalysts still remain in the micellar solution.",

In particular, the regio-selectivity has been studied as a function of the trans effect of several sets of small model ligands with different \u03c3-donor and \u03c0-accepting abilities. It has been shown, both by analyzing the geometries and comparing the activation energies, that the TS for branched product formation is more sensitive than the TS leading to linear product, although most ligand combinations give a preference for the linear product. The branched TS is strongly destabilized by any strong ligand in a position trans to the alkene in the pre-insertion intermediate. For the ligand trans to the migrating group, a strong trans effect accelerates the reaction, more for the branched than for the linear product formation. On electronic grounds, the regio-selectivity and rate can be adjusted by considering not only the trans effect of a ligand, but also by controlling the position they will have in the migratory insertion step. Very importantly, the trans effect change in the selectivity-determining TS will be expected to give rise to Halpern-type selectivity, with the consequence that product distributions cannot be reliably predicted from observable intermediates.",

We characterized these MFI catalysts by BET surface area measurements, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia, and 27Al MAS NMR to understand the effect of the Si/Al2 ratio. The ethanol conversion reaction was systematically investigated using these catalysts according to the contact time and reaction temperature. The conversion of ethanol yielded similar product distributions over these catalysts at different contact times, indicating that the product distribution has no relationship with the Si/Al2 ratio. Also, the propylene production rates per acidic site of these catalysts were similar. These results strongly imply that the acidic sites of the different MFI-type zeolite catalysts have the same nature, as well as the same reactivity.

The catalysts were characterized by the XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM methods. The photocatalytic mineralization of oxalic acid, catalyzed by WO3/TiO2 or Au/WO3/TiO2, proceeded at a significantly higher rate under UV-A irradiation than that under visible light.

The higher rate constants of oxalic acid decomposition under UV, visible or UV\u2013visible light irradiation with the WO3/TiO2 and Au/WO3/TiO2 catalysts, compared with those measured with the individual oxide photocatalysts, are due to the more efficient separation of the electron\u2013hole charges generated upon irradiation.

     "abstract": "The mechanism of gas-phase alkylation of phenol with methanol was studied on zeolites HBEA, HZSM5 and HMCM22. The nature, density and strength of the acid sites were determined by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. In all the cases, anisole, o-cresol and p-cresol were the primary products, but the initial product distribution greatly depended on the zeolite pore structure and surface acid properties. The complete reaction network was established by investigating the formation of secondary products (xylenols, methylanisoles, m-cresol) via the reactions of primary products with phenol and methanol. On HBEA, phenol was alkylated to primary and secondary products without significant diffusional restraints and the yield to dialkylated products increased when phenol conversion was increased. o-Cresol was consecutively alkylated to 2,4- and 2,6-xylenols (C-alkylation), and 2-methylanisole (O-alkylation). Anisole reacted with phenol to yield o- and p-cresol isomers, and with methanol to form methylanisoles. Selectivities to primary products on HZSM5 were similar to those determined on HBEA, but the formation of bulky intermediates leading to dialkylated compounds was hampered because of diffusional constraints. The alkylation of phenol with anisole to yield cresol isomers was completely suppressed on HZSM5. The particular pore structure of zeolite HMCM22 promoted the selective formation of p-cresol among the primary products of phenol methylation and drastically suppressed the consecutive reactions forming secondary products. In contrast, isomerization reactions between monoalkylated products were promoted on zeolite HMCM22 because of its high concentration of strong Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. The activity decay on stream was significant on the three zeolites, probably because of the formation of coke intermediates via both anisole dealkylation and methanol dehydration reactions.",

The typical immobilized Pd catalyst is tested using hydrogenation of cinnamyl alcohol in water at 300\u00a0K as model reaction.

Crystal structure and crystallite size of the titania nanomaterials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, and the optical properties of aqueous suspensions at various TiO2 loadings were measured using UV/visible spectroscopy.

In the series TC the presence of an NH4Cl salt matrix, which was removed by decomposition to gaseous byproducts in the post-annealing process, leads to the formation of anatase nanocrystals with optimal size for high photoactivity (23\u201350\u00a0nm) at temperatures of 550 and 650\u00a0\u00b0C, and these titania samples are the most active in the photoinduced production of reactive oxygen species. The results found for TCSM series confirmed that the presence of a sulfate salt matrix (Na2SO4) during mechanochemical and annealing processes significantly hindered TiO2 nanocrystallite growth, increased agglomerate formation in aqueous media and lowered the values of photonic efficiencies determined via paramagnetic species formation or termination.",

The results show that TFA not only induces the formation of hollow microspheres, but also enhances their crystallization. The molar ratios of TFA to Ti(SO4)2 (R) have a great influence on photocatalytic activity. When R is in the range of 0.5\u20135, the photocatalytic activity of the samples is higher than that of commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 powders (P25) and pure TiO2 samples. At R\u00a0=\u00a02, the photocatalytic activity of the sample reaches the highest and exceeds that of P25 by a factor of more than two times.

The FTS reaction behaviors of the catalysts were measured at 1.5\u00a0MPa, 260\u00a0\u00b0C and syngas with H2/CO ratio of 2.0. The results show that there are two distinct forms of bimetallic interactions for the promoted catalysts, namely (1) ZnFe2O4 compound formed for Zn-promoted iron catalyst and (2) solid solutions observed for those promoted by either Cr or Mn promoters. The presence of ZnFe2O4 compound in the Zn-promoted catalyst leads to the phase separations between Zn and Fe oxides, and therefore very similar catalytic behavior to that of unpromoted catalyst. The stability of activity was improved due to the increased dispersion of active site through the formation of ZnFe2O4 compound. In contrast, for the Mn- and Cr-promoted catalysts, the solid solutions in FeMn and FeCr systems strongly inhibit the reduction of the catalysts, and enhance the stability of catalytic activity. The FTS tests show that Mn and Cr promoters enhance the olefin and C5+ hydrocarbon selectivity and restrain the methane selectivity due to their more strong basic sites. Besides the surface basicity the selectivities of Mn-promoted catalyst are also correlated with the enrichment of Mn on the catalyst surface.",

Au/TiO2 showed a narrower metal particle size (1\u201310\u00a0nm) distribution than Ag/TiO2 (1\u201315\u00a0nm) but both catalysts exhibited a similar surface area weighted mean size (6\u20137\u00a0nm). A time-invariant nitroarene conversion has been established where Au/TiO2 delivered higher specific hydrogenation rates. We associate this response to an enhanced reactant activation on Au/TiO2 to generate a negatively charged intermediate, consistent with a nucleophilic mechanism. The presence of electron-withdrawing substituents is shown to enhance \u2013NO2 reduction rate. This effect is quantified in terms of the Hammett relationship where a linear correlation between the substituent constant (\u03c3i) and rate is established and a higher reaction constant (\u03c1) was recorded for Au/TiO2 (0.93) relative to Ag/TiO2 (0.22).

The highest selectivity (\u223c97%) was achieved by using Na3HSiW12O40/SiO2. The activity decreased with an increase in the Na+ ion content. Unmodified H4SiW12O40/SiO2 had two kinds of acid sites with different acid strengths (medium and strong acid sites) on the outermost surface as revealed by temperature-programmed desorption of benzonitrile. However, the strong acid sites were eliminated by modification with alkaline metal cations; for example, Na3HSiW12O40/SiO2 had a negligible amount of strong acid sites.

Li3HSiW12O40/SiO2 and K3HSiW12O40/SiO2 also exhibited high selectivity for isobutene oligomerization with activities comparable to that of Na3HSiW12O40/SiO2.",

In liquid phase hydrogenation of butanone to R-(\u2212)-2-butanol, the optimized MRQNi catalyst exhibits much better activity and enantioselectivity than the similarly chirally modified Raney Ni catalyst.

This could be due to strong metal\u2013support interactions, which result in more electrophilic palladium or a reduced palladium catalyst that is easier to reoxidize, both of which are expected to result in high catalytic activities. As the PdO is completely reduced to Pd metal on spent catalysts (according to XPS and XRD), facilitated reoxidation could be important in this reaction. While reoxidation is a potential deactivation pathway, carbon deposition is also evident in the XPS spectra and this could block active sites. In contrast, both the XPS and the XRD data indicate that Pd leaching into the reaction solution is not a significant deactivation pathway in the PdO/n-Al2O3(+) catalyst system.The nm-sized fine structure observed in the supports of the PdO/\u03b3-Al2O3 and PdO/n-Al2O3(+), together with their measured activities compared to the poorly active PdO/n-Al2O3(\u2212) catalyst with no such fine structure, supports our hypothesis that low-coordination sites on a support can result in strong metal\u2013support interactions and very active catalysts. Highly active crystalline PdO particles with sizes of 5\u00a0nm or below may explain the observed lack of correlation between the measured Pd surface area (which should correlate with the PdO surface area) and the catalytic activity.",

The mechanistic details of oxygen atom transfer from TpRMoO2(XPh) to PMe3 were investigated for R\u00a0=\u00a03-iPr and 3-Me and X\u00a0=\u00a0O and S by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the enthalpies, free energy with solvent corrections, and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. The mechanism for both systems proceeds via rate-determining attack of PMe3 to form a stable intermediate with a bound OPMe3 ligand. From this intermediate the reaction proceeds through a substitution involving loss of OPMe3 and coordination of a single CH3CN solvent molecule. The solvent corrected free energy barriers of the rate-determining OAT step for the O and S systems were found to be energetically more favorable for the S systems by 6.2 and 2.2\u00a0kcal/mol (for the R\u00a0=\u00a03-iPr and 3-Me, respectively). This lower energy barrier is the result of better stabilization by the SPh ligand of the MoIV products and the transition states, which are the unexpectedly later and more product-like. Additional examination of the NBO analysis emphasizes the role of the local acidity of the Mo and by extension the character of the ligands. The decreased electronegativity and softer character of the S atom result in an increased covalent character in the Mo\u2013X bond which leads to the stabilization of a later (and lower energy) transition state and the corresponding product of the S system relative to O system.",

     "abstract": "The mechanism for rhodium(I) mediated arylation of aromatic aldehydes by arylboronic acids under base and water free conditions was investigated with DFT methods. The detailed picture resulting from the calculations is that the reaction proceeds via an internal base mechanism, whereby the initially formed alcoholate (obtained by aryl migration to the aldehyde) attacks the electrophilic boron atom of the coordinated arylboronic acid substrate to facilitate the aryl transfer to the metal. Alternative pathways involving B\u2013C oxidative addition or internal proton transfer followed by \u03b2-aryl transfer from thus resulting Rh\u2013O\u2013BPh(OH) moieties are kinetically disfavored. The rhodium atom does not change its oxidation state throughout this whole process, and all steps proceed smoothly within the coordination sphere of rhodium(I). Aldehyde migratory insertion into the RhI-aryl bond appears to be the rate limiting step (\u0394G\u2020\u00a0=\u00a0+19.4\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) of the catalytic cycle.

These ligand effects, relevant to the catalytic activity, are described in terms of the phosphine donor/acceptor and steric features. The regression models show that oxidative addition is mainly governed by electronic effects whereas the transmetallation and the reductive elimination processes are controlled by a mixture of both ligand effects.

It was found that this oxidative addition is an exothermic process with a relatively low activation barrier. The activation energy is highly dependent on the organic substituents of the iodoniun salts. For example, an ethynyl group is transferred with a considerably lower activation barrier from iodine to palladium, than a phenyl functionality. We have compared the reaction profiles of the oxidative addition of hypervalent iodonium salts and phenyl iodide. The most important difference between the two processes is that the oxidative addition of phenyl iodide is highly endothermic, as the reductive elimination of phenyl iodide from the Pd(IV) species requires a very low barrier. In contrast, the formation of the Pd(IV) species using hypervalent iodonium salts is an irreversible process, which allows ligand exchange and trasmetallation reactions generating a productive catalytic cycle. The studies indicate that the most important MO's involved in the oxidation is the antibonding \u03c3* orbital of the iodonium salt and a non-bonding Pd(4d) orbital, which is perpendicular to the coordination plane of the palladium atom.",

Analogy to other MAO-activated catalysts suggests that the active species should be a [(bis(oxazoline)pyridine)RuMe(ethylene)]+ (II) cation. However, the structurally similar [(bis(imino)pyridine)RuMe(ethylene)]+ (III) complex was found to be inactive [28]. A density functional theory (DFT) investigation of direct ethylene insertion into the metal\u2013propyl bond in cationic ruthenium complexes bearing the bis(oxazoline)pyridine (\u201cpybox\u201d) and bis(imino)pyridine ligands shows that the activity of I/MAO and inactivity of III cannot be explained by differences in the insertion barriers for such cations. This indicates that the catalytic activity of I/MAO must originate from an active species different from II. An extensive search for the active species of I/MAO, involving a range of different polymerization mechanisms and metal oxidation states did not result in calculated barriers to chain growth significantly lower than that for III, suggesting that the latter is not due to a mononuclear ruthenium complex carrying an intact pybox ligand.",

Their binding energies were calculated using both wave function theory (WFT) and density functional theory (DFT). Previously it was reported that the binding energy of the alkene to the transition metal does not depend strongly on the size of the conjugated CnHn\u00a0+\u00a02 ligand, but that DFT methods systematically underestimate the binding energy more and more significantly as the size of the conjugated system is increased. Our results show that recently developed density functionals predict the binding energy for these systems much more accurately. New benchmark calculations carried out by the coupled cluster method based on Brueckner orbitals with double excitations and a quasiperturbative treatment of connected triple excitations (BCCD(T)) with a very large basis set agree even better with the DFT predictions than do the previous best estimates. The mean unsigned error in absolute and relative binding energies of the alkene ligands to Pd(PH3)2 is 2.5\u00a0kcal/mol for the \u03c9B97 and M06 density functionals and 2.9\u00a0kcal/mol for the M06-L functional. Adding molecular mechanical damped dispersion yields even smaller mean unsigned errors: 1.3\u00a0kcal/mol for the M06-D functional, 1.5\u00a0kcal/mol for M06-L-D, and 1.8\u00a0kcal/mol for B97-D and \u03c9B97X-D.

     "abstract": "With the use of computational methods in the field of drug design becoming ever more prevalent, there is pressure to port these technologies to other fields. One of the fields ripe for application of computational drug design techniques; specifically virtual screening and computer-aided molecular design, is the design and synthesis of asymmetric catalysts. Such methods could either guide the selection of the optimal catalyst(s) for a given reaction and a given substrate or provide an enriched selection of highly efficient asymmetric catalysts which enable the synthetic chemists to focus on the most promising candidates. This would in turn provide savings in time and reduce the costs associated with the synthesis and evaluation of large libraries of molecules. However, to be applicable to the evaluation of a large number of potential catalysts, speed is of utmost importance. This impetus has led to the development of medium to high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) methods for asymmetric catalyst development or assessment, although a very few applications have been reported. These methods typically fall into four classes: methods combining quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM), pure molecular mechanics-based methods \u2013 a class which can be subdivided into static and dynamic transition state modeling \u2013 and lastly quantitative structure selectivity relationship methods (QSSR). This review will cover specific methods within these classes and their application to selected reactions.",

The presence of at least two gallium species was proposed, at low gallium content GaAl2O4 species decreased the isoelectric point (IEP) and probably the formation of Ga2O3 at higher contents increased again the IEP. Raman spectroscopy showed that the gallium incorporation had a strong effect in the formation of WOx species at the surface of catalysts. The highest amount of irregular WOx particles calculated by the Raman (OWO\u00a0+\u00a0WO)/W\u2013O\u2013W band intensities ratio was found on the W/Ga(1.09)\u2013\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst.

The Ce\u2013Zr mixed oxides prepared from the precursor (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 shows the highest NO oxidation capacity among the samples prepared in this study.

The formation of H2O2 and the initiation of hydroxyl radical (OH) reach a maximum at the bicarbonate concentration 75 and 50\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121, respectively. The mechanism investigation suggests that bicarbonate plays an important role as a promoter of radical chain reactions accelerating the ozone mass transformation, causing the increases in the utilization efficiency of ozone, the formation of H2O2 and the initiation of OH at the lower concentration. Bicarbonate with the higher concentration exerts a negative effect on the degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene due to the predominance derived from its scavenging capacity of OH.",

The optimized Fe\u2013Al\u2013Cu formulation demonstrated stable WGS performance over a wide temperature range (250\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C). X-ray diffraction patterns revealed the role of promoters in the formation of maghemite phase and in controlling the crystallite size. The incorporation of copper in iron oxide matrix resulted in formation of maghemite phase over hematite, thereby causing a significant improvement in WGS performance. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) study of CO adsorption indicated the formation of formate species on the surface. The apparent activation energies for re-oxidation of the Fe\u2013Al\u2013Cu catalysts were found to depend on the copper content. Over the best performing Fe\u2013Al\u2013Cu catalyst, surface re-oxidation by water during WGS reaction proceeds at a much higher rate than surface reduction via CO oxidation, whereas for other catalysts of the series, surface re-oxidation was shown to be the rate determining step.",

     "abstract": "Zirconocene dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) supported on montmorillonite K-10, which has previously been shown to be an efficient catalytic system for olefin polymerization, was found to be comparable to the highly activated homogeneous combination of Cp2ZrCl2 and methylaluminoxane (MAO), and more reactive than the originally reported homogeneous catalytic system of Cp2ZrCl2/Me3Al in the methylalumination reaction of an aryl substituted terminal alkyne. Examination of solvent effects in the ethylalumination reaction using Cp2ZrCl2 supported on montmorillonite K-10, SiO2/LiOH, and SiO2/MgO, indicated that the anionic counterpart of the actual catalytically active zirconocenium cation is highly delocalized, thus suggesting that the actual active zirconocenium cation is only very weakly coordinating with the anionic moiety. This accounts for the high activity of systems using solids such as co-catalysts and as supporting materials in olefin polymerization in general.",

While spectroscopic data, DRX, and nitrogen isotherm adsorptions revealed the similarity of the two kinds of materials, and the preservation of the MCM characteristic structure, elemental analysis showed that the stepwise approach (ligand\u00a0+\u00a0complex precursor) allowed the introduction of a much larger amount of molybdenum.

According to our prior study (Kadossov et al., in press [49]), a maximum in the initial adsorption probability, S0, occurs for 3\u00a0nm Au clusters. Therefore, in the present study, we have focused on this cluster size for PVD samples. In addition, 12\u00a0nm EBL Au clusters have been studied. This is presently one of the smallest achievable cluster sizes using EBL for macroscopic samples. Auger electron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy have been used to further characterize the samples. TDS revealed well-known features for PVD samples; i.e., two peaks assigned to CO adsorption on different defect sites were present. Interestingly, TDS data of EBL samples were dominated solely by one CO desorption peak. The initial adsorption probability of CO, S0, decreased as a function of impact energy, Ei, and adsorption temperature, Ts, for both samples, which is consistent with non-activated molecular adsorption. The coverage dependence of the adsorption probability and S0 are discussed in the framework of the capture zone model.",

The degradation of rhB by \u03b3-Bi2MoO6 seems to happen predominantly through the photosensitization of the organic dye by the action of visible light irradiation. On the other hand, the IC degradation simultaneously happens by photosensitization and true photocatalytic processes. The activity of \u03b3-Bi2MoO6 for the degradation of MO was negligible. The reached mineralization degrees after 100\u00a0h of irradiation were 86% for rhB and 80% for IC.",

The calcination of SiO2 at 500\u00a0\u00b0C prior to the catalyst preparation can alter the structure of Au nanoparticles in Au/CoO/SiO2 catalysts by changing the distribution of hydrogen-bonded and isolated hydroxyls in Co(OH)2.

It was found that increased calcination temperature gave an improvement of the anatase crystallinity and an enrichment of phosphorus species on the titania surface. The increased surface P content led to a linear enhancement of the specific adsorption capacity of methylene blue (MB) because of the Coulombic attractive force between the cationic dye and the negatively charged P-doped TiO2 surface.

EPR spectroscopy shows that in heterogeneous manganese catalysts the Mn2+ centers are in a flexible, non-tight, coordination environment, as in the corresponding homogeneous manganese catalysts. However, after a first use of the heterogeneous catalysts, the Mn centers are detached from the ligand and are randomly dispersed on the SiO2 surface.

The mesopore structure of MCM-41 was not affected extensively by the introduction of Pt and Ge.

     "abstract": "A series of WOx/TiO2 catalysts containing between 0.6 and 3.4\u00a0W\u00a0at./nm2 was prepared by pore volume impregnation using ammonium metatungstate solution on crystallized TiO2. Characterization of the solids by X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopy indicated that the W phase was present essentially as a surface W species. The results also suggested an increased degree of condensation of the W phase with increasing W surface density. The most condensed W species was characterized by a \u03bd(WO) vibration at 1017\u00a0cm\u22121.The IR or Raman bands attributed to specific surface species of the solids were correlated with the abundance of relatively strong Br\u00f8nsted acid sites and isopropanol dehydration activity. A direct correlation was observed between propene formation rate and the area of the band at 1017\u00a0cm\u22121, attributed to the most condensed W species. Furthermore, the abundance of this species appeared to be directly related to that of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites capable of retaining 2,6-dimethyl pyridine (lutidine) following desorption at 573\u00a0K. The behavior of the WOx/TiO2 system was compared with that reported for the corresponding WOx/ZrO2 solids. Higher intrinsic activity (activity per W atom) was observed for WOx/TiO2 system.",

The Cu/RHA catalyst with 10.2\u00a0wt.% Cu loading and under 673\u00a0K calcination has higher copper dispersion and smaller Cu particle size. This catalyst exhibits higher activity and selectivity for POM to produce H2. The partial pressure of O2 plays an important role to determine the product distribution. Catalytic activity of the catalyst at different reaction temperatures shows that CH3OH conversion, H2 selectivity and CO selectivity increase with rise in temperature. At different temperatures along with POM, several reactions such as methanol combustion, steam reforming of methanol, methanol decomposition, water gas shift and oxidation of CO and H2 might be involved. Comparison of catalytic activity of Cu/RHA and Cu/SiO2 catalysts demonstrates that Cu/SiO2 catalysts deactivate with time with faster rate and have higher CO selectivity.

Whereas this last material shows a low activity for the three epoxide rearrangement reactions considered, nanocrystalline ZSM-5 leads in all cases to high epoxide conversion. This different catalytic performance is attributed to the differences in the accessibility of the reactant molecules to the catalyst active sites. The smallest crystal size of the nanocrystalline zeolite contributes favourably to both the formation of a high external surface area, with no steric constraints, and to a faster intracrystalline diffusion of the epoxide molecules towards the acid sites located within the zeolite micropores. When sterically hindered epoxides are tested, the catalytic rearrangement occurs mainly on the external surface of the nanocrystalline zeolite. Moreover, it is remarkable that for the three epoxides investigated the high catalytic activity observed over nanocrystalline ZSM-5 is accompanied by the attainment of high selectivities, typically around or over 80%, towards products with commercial applications.",

     "abstract": "DFT calculations were carried out to study the behavior of NO2 in the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia on the surface of the V2O5 catalyst. The results showed that NO2 could readily reoxidize V4+\u2013OH through two reaction routes: (1) NO2 directly reoxidizing V4+\u2013OH to V5+O and (2) NO2 reacting with H2O or NH3 to produce HNO3, which subsequently reoxidizes V4+\u2013OH to V5+O. The rate-determining step of route 1 is the desorption of cis-HNO2 from the reoxidized V5+O, being endothermic by 9.91\u00a0kcal/mol. Route 2 possesses an energy barrier of 7.44\u00a0kcal/mol, less than route 1. This energetic comparison shows that route 2 is the predominant reaction mechanism at low temperature. Reactions of the by-product, HNO2, were also investigated. The results showed that both cis-HNO2 (route 1) and trans-HNO2 (route 2) can either react with NH3, producing H2O and N2, or react with themselves, producing H2O, NO and NO2. A systemic description of the behavior for NO2 in \u201cfast\u201d SCR on V2O5 surface, including the reaction routes and energy profiles, has been proposed in our work.",

The encapsulated Au nanoparticles keep stable during the reversible deswelling/swelling of the thermoresponsive hydrogel/Au composite. The catalysis of the thermoresponsive composite is tested employing aerobic alcohol oxidation as model reaction and it is found that the catalytic activity of the thermoresponsive composite is strongly dependent on the size of the encapsulated Au nanoparticles. Besides, it is found that the thermoresponsive composite is catalytically efficient for aerobic alcohol oxidation partly since the reactant of alcohol is highly concentrated within the hydrogel matrix through the reversible deswelling and partly since the reactant of alcohol can be activated through the strong hydrogen bonding between the alcohol molecules and the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) segment.

The nature of the counterion determines whether the HKR reaction follows primarily a bimetallic or monometallic reaction path, which significantly affects catalyst recyclability. For example, Co(III)-salen initially containing the nucleophilic Cl\u2212 counterion catalyzes the HKR of epichlorohydrin according to a bimetallic reaction path but loses activity upon recycle, as Cl\u2212 is replaced with OH\u2212 during the reaction. In contrast, a Co(III)-salen catalyst containing non-nucleophilic SbF6\u2212 counterion catalyzes the reaction according to a monometallic reaction path and is quite stable during multiple recycles, albeit at a low rate with less selectivity. A mixed catalyst system with Co(III)-salen initially containing Cl\u2212 to which Co(III)-salen with SbF6\u2212 is later added demonstrates high activity and high stability to recycling.

Reaction was studied for triacetin, a model triglyceride and for vegetable oil, castor oil. Various techniques (BET, FTIR, XRD, XPS, laser diffraction, electron microscopy, SEM, and EDS) were used to characterize as-received Ag-salts and the samples separated after the catalytic tests. Because of the presence of methanol, which is the reactant, silver salts formed colloidal dispersion during the catalytic reaction. Under such conditions, all silver salts were active for transesterification of triglycerides. The conversion of triglycerides gradually decreases as the protons in heteropolyacid are replaced by Ag+ cations. However, due to the leaching of parent H3PW12O40 upon dissolving in methanol, the contribution of homogeneous catalysis was observed, especially in the presence of Ag-salts with low silver content such as Ag0.5H2.5PW12O40. Catalytic performance of Ag-salts in methanolysis of a short-chain triglyceride, triacetin, differs remarkably from that in castor oil comprising natural, long-chain triglycerides. After transesterification of castor oil, initially crystalline particles of Ag-salts partially rearrange to \u201cgel-type\u201d material making their further processing difficult.

     "abstract": "Immobilization of [60]fullerene onto \u03b3-Al2O3 surface provides new heterogeneous photocatalysts for the oxidation of organic compounds under oxygen atmosphere. These catalysts have been prepared by simple or successive incipient wetness impregnation (using an organic solvent) followed by air-heating at 180\u00a0\u00b0C. In the C60/Al2O3 system, C60 loading was varied in the range of 1\u20134% (w/w). Several experimental techniques including BET, XRD, DRS, TGA, microelectrophoresis, photoluminescence and kinetic extraction, have been used to characterize these catalytic materials. It was found that the quite high surface exposed by the supported C60 increases with the amount of the supported C60, while the dispersion of the supported C60 decreases. The quite stable supported [60]fullerene phase is comprised from C60 clusters, small and large aggregates. This non-uniform size distribution is reflected to a non-uniform distribution concerning the \u2018supported phase\u2013support\u2019 interactions. These interactions decrease with the amount of the supported C60. The photocatalysts prepared may be safely used up to 200\u00a0\u00b0C. Above this temperature the supported C60 is sublimated/combusted in air.The photocatalytic activity of the so-obtained catalytic systems has been evaluated in terms of substrate conversion in the singlet oxygen \u2018ene\u2019 reaction of alkenes. The photooxygenation of 2-methyl-2-heptene has been examined as a probe reaction. It was found that the catalytic activity increases with the increasing amount of the supported C60 up to the value of 3% (w/w) and then decreases. The intrinsic activity expressed as TON or TOF decreased monotonically with C60. In all cases, however, the photocatalytic activity of the Al2O3-supported C60 catalysts was substantially increased compared to the unsupported C60 precursor, exhibiting quantitative conversion yields after short reaction times. The catalytic behavior was attributed to the aforementioned opposite trends which follow the surface exposed by the supported C60 on one hand and the \u2018supported C60\u2013support\u2019 interactions and the C60 dispersion on the other hand. The easy separation of these solid catalysts from the reaction mixture, the high activity and stability as well as the retained activity in subsequent catalytic cycles, make these supported catalysts suitable for a small-scale synthesis.",

They are used to verify the theory that the difference between the conduction band edges of the two phases may produce charge transfer from one phase to the other, which results in effectively the photo-generated charge separation and thus facilitates the redox reaction involving these charges. Indeed, the mixed-phase nanofibers exhibit higher photocatalytic activity for degradation of sulforhodamine B (SRB) under UV light than the nanofibers of either pure phase alone, or the mechanical mixtures of the two pure phase nanofibers with a similar phase composition. The interfaces between the two phases have a function of preventing charge recombination and enhancing the activity for photocatalytic oxidation. These interfaces are not random contacts between the crystals of the two phases, but form from well-matched lattice planes of the two phases. For instance, (2\u00a00\u00a02) planes in anatase and (2\u00a00\u00a02) planes of TiO2(B) are similar in d-spaces \u223c0.18\u00a0nm, and they join together to form a stable interface. Such an interface structure is advanced for charge transfer crossing the interfaces, which reduces the recombination between the photo-generated electrons and holes. The knowledge acquired in this study is important not only for design of efficient TiO2 photocatalysts but also for understanding the photocatalysis process.",

According to the analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in the as-prepared catalyst, gold was well dispersed and in an oxidized state of Au3+; and it was reduced to metallic crystals (Au0) during its use as catalyst. The temperature programmed desorption (TPD) results show that gold species in the two states strongly adsorb HCHO molecules at ambient temperature. The adsorbed HCHO molecules convert rapidly into formate species, as observed by the infrared spectra. The temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) study reveals that at temperatures below 450\u00a0K, the HCHO oxidation involves reaction between adsorbed formate species and adsorbed oxygen molecules. This explains why the gold species in both states are the active sites for HCHO oxidation, and also indicates that HCHO adsorption on the gold species and oxygen adsorption on the support are crucial steps for the oxidation.",

The activity of two selected Mo centres is examined by the calculation of the pathway of ethene metathesis. In both cases the cycloaddition of ethene to the Mo methylidene centre proceeds easily. On the other hand, the cycloreverse step involves a relatively high energy barrier for the Mo centre with one Al site in the vicinity, whereas the barrier is low for the model with two T sites occupied by Al atoms. Moreover, the key molybdacyclobutane intermediate is a thermodynamically stable species in the first case, but it is unstable in the second case. Thus, a high metathesis activity is predicted if two Br\u00f8nsted acid sites are replaced by the Mo centre.

Six energy minima were determined and their relative stabilities increase in the order PAf\u00a0<\u00a0PAe\u00a0<\u00a0PAb\u00a0<\u00a0PAc\u00a0<\u00a0PAa\u00a0<\u00a0Pad.

The rate-determining step of Route 2 is the formation of C3\u2013N bond with the energy barrier equal to 86\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121. This step is accelerated by the following barrierless process. As the theoretical results indicated, Route 4 needs to start with at least 2\u00a0mole\u00a0equiv. acetone, consistent with the high acetone concentrations used in experiments. The rate-determining step of Route 4 is the intra-carboxyl proton transfer, which was revealed to be greatly assisted by solvents.",

The maximum activity is found for metals with a binding energy of oxygen around \u22122.5\u00a0eV. No clear correlation exists with the adsorption energy of CO. In contrast, the activity for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support increases with increasing adsorption strength for CO, and based on a relatively low activity of Cu the activity does not seem to depend on the adsorption energy of oxygen. Such a change in activity-descriptor for the different supports can be rationalized by the possibility that water dissociation occurs on the redox-active Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support, whereas the MgAl2O4 support is inactive.",

The ideal catalyst surface was modeled as a five-layer Ni(1\u00a00\u00a00) slab. We also studied the influence of magnesium, considered as an atomic substitutional impurity, on carbon adsorption and migration into the bulk.To study the effect of Mg on the structure of Ni-based catalysts, we replaced a Ni atom by a Mg atom, on the surface and also in the bulk. Then, we relaxed the Mg and Ni positions. Our results showed that Ni atoms were pushed away from Mg. We also performed energy calculations to evaluate carbon interactions on different preferential sites of the Ni-slab, and also the effect of Mg atom on these deposition processes.The calculations showed that carbon adsorption on the bare Ni(1\u00a00\u00a00) surface was more favorable than deposition on this surface doped with magnesium. Our results also indicated that Mg could improve the interaction of surface-adsorbed carbon with gas phase oxygen, leading to the formation of a CO precursor species. In this way, magnesium promotes Ni-based catalysts hindering the surface from attaining a high carbon coverage, and thus making difficult the formation of carbon agglomerates and carbon whiskers. We also considered the effect of Ca in the C\u2013O interaction on the metal surface.",

The activation barrier for methane dissociation on clean Ni(1\u00a00\u00a00) is much lower than that on the oxygen atom pre-adsorbed Ni(1\u00a00\u00a00) and NiO(1\u00a00\u00a00) surface. Thus the active site for methane dissociation is the metallic Ni instead of the oxidized Ni. Moreover, the decomposition of activation barrier has been performed. The result further explains how the existence of oxygen atom increases the barrier. Though the pre-adsorbed oxygen atom decreases the interaction between CH3 and H in the transition state, it greatly decreases the interaction of CH3 and H with substrate. So the overall result is that the oxygen atom inhibits the dissociation of methane on Ni surface. Importantly, it was found that a three-center bond formed in the transition state when oxygen atom acts as a spectator, which leading to a smaller energy barrier for the reaction of CH4\u00a0+\u00a0O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0CH3\u00a0+\u00a0H\u00a0+\u00a0O than that of CH4\u00a0+\u00a0O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0CH3\u00a0+\u00a0OH.",

     "abstract": "Isomorphously substituted (MeDM) and impregnated metal-containing MCM-41 (MeOx/IM) catalysts, in which Me\u00a0=\u00a0Co, Cu, Cr, Fe or Ni, have been prepared. Structural and textural characterizations of the catalysts were performed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical analysis, Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), N2 adsorption isotherms and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). Cu2+, Co2+, and Cr4+/Cr3+ species were found over the catalysts as cations incorporated in the MCM-41 structure (MeDM) or highly dispersed oxides on the surface (MeOx/IM). The MeDM catalysts exhibited a good performance in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. However, MeOx/IM catalysts had a low performance in styrene production (activity less than 15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0mmol\u00a0h\u22121 and selectivity for styrene less than 80%) due to the high reducibility of the metals species. However, Ni2+ or Fe3+ coordinated with the MCM-41 framework, as well as NiOx and Fe2O3 extra-framework species, is continuously oxidized by the CO2 to maintain the active sites for dehydrogenating ethylbenzene. Deactivation studies on the FeDM sample showed that Fe3+ species produced active sp2 carbon compounds, which are removed by CO2; the referred sample is catalytically selective for styrene and stable over 24\u00a0h of reaction. In contrast, highly active Ni2+ and Ni0 species produced a large amount of polyaromatic carbonaceous deposits from styrene, as identified by TPO, TG and Raman spectroscopy. An acid\u2013base mechanism is proposed to operate to adsorb ethylbenzene and abstract the \u03b2-hydrogen. CO2 plays a role in furnishing the lattice oxygen to maintain the Fe3+ active sites in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to form styrene.",

     "abstract": "A chitosan-g-mTEG (methoxy triethylene glycol)- or mPEG (methoxy polyethylene glycol)-supported palladium (0) catalyst was prepared for the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction in water. The catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity in the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction without additional phase transfer reagents due to the enhanced solubility of the organic substrate by PEG grafting. In addition, the catalyst could be reused up to five times with the catalytic activity being recovered easily after simple manipulations.",
