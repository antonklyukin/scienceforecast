     "abstract": "Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is an important enzyme response for the metabolism or detoxification of toxic aldehydes, in particular acetaldehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which were important risk factors for acute alcoholism and stroke respectively. A special variant ALDH2\u22172 with reduced enzymatic activity was carried by a high percentage of East Asians, especially Han Chinese, and that could increase the risk of these diseases further. Therefore, ALDH2 activators had important potential clinical values. N-benzylbenzamide compounds represented by Alda-1 were the only ALDH2-specific activators that have been reported so far. In this study, three new classes of compounds were modified from Alda-1 to improve their water-solubility and then drug-like properties. The results showed that all compounds had increased water solubility and two classes of compounds exhibited good activation activity. Among them, compound I-6 showed the best activity.",

The catalytic chemical conversion through methanation reaction is the most promising technology to convert this harmful CO2 gas to wealth CH4 gas for the combustion. Thus, supported neodymium oxide based catalyst doped with manganese and ruthenium was prepared via wet impregnation route. The screening was initiated with a series of Nd/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at 400\u202f\u00b0C followed by optimization with respect to calcination temperatures, based ratios loading and various Ru loading. The Ru/Mn/Nd (5:20:75)/Al2O3 calcined at 1000\u202f\u00b0C was the potential catalyst, attaining a complete CO2 conversion and forming 40% of CH4 at 400\u202f\u00b0C reaction temperature. XRD results revealed an amorphous phase with the occurrence of active species of RuO2, MnO2, and Nd2O3, and the mass ratio of Mn was the highest among other active species as confirmed by EDX.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of these basic additives and the treated filler on the biodegradation, morphological, and thermal properties of the prepared samples by a soil burial test. The samples were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Weight loss was calculated to investigate the biodegradation of the sample, and SEM and thermogravimetric analyses were performed to reveal the morphology and thermal properties before and after burial, respectively. Results showed that the presence of the bio-filler accelerated the biodegradation of the composites. The UV stabilizer had a positive impact on biodegradation factors whereas anti-block additives appeared resistant to biodegradable factors. The morphology and thermal stability of all the prepared samples changed after burial due to the effects of biodegradation during the burial.",

The experimental results show that the SERS intensity exhibits a 100-fold increase with the increased average length and quantity of gold branches (nano tips).

In this study, functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT)-polyaniline (Pani) composites were fabricated using an oxidation polymerization methodology and later doped with para toluene sulfonic acid (pTSA). The CNTs provided an adequate substrate for the adhesion of Pani as well as a large surface area due to its nano size, and pTSA provided additional functionality for the adsorption of differently charged moieties through strong or weak interactions. The as-synthesized pTSA-Pani@CNT nanocomposite was analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy for the morphological studies and the structural analysis were done by the X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The characterization results confirmed that the Pani was adhered to the CNTs as well as its successful functionalization with pTSA. The pTSA-Pani@CNT composite was then applied to the adsorptive removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and the composite showed higher adsorption for Cr(VI) than pTSA-CNT and pTSA-Pani, and the maximum removal level was detected at acidic pH. The analyses of the equilibrium isotherms and adsorption kinetics were performed to elucidate the adsorption mechanism.

Successful internalization of Cu+2 ions inside the cell was estimated by the atomic absorption study. Cellular uptake of Cu+2 ions inflicted significant Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation inside the cancer cells, thereby leading to DNA fragmentation as observed by DAPI staining. In in vivo model, CuONPs reduced the breast tumor volume in Balb/C mice and increased the mean survival time through the alteration of pro-inflammatory cytokines level. In case of both in vivo and in vitro models, CuONPs altered the pro-inflammatory cytokine level and pro-apoptotic protein expressions.

The intermolecular interaction data from COSMO-RS provide an insight into the relationship between the intermolecular interactions and its crystal habit across four different polar protic solvents. The habit of the crystals was then determined using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques, while the polymorphic form of the crystals was identified by X-ray powder diffraction and single X-ray diffraction techniques.

The scale inhibition behavior of PESA with linear and hyper-branched structure against CaCO3 and CaSO4 scales was evaluated using static scale inhibition method, and their ability to retard deposition of CaCO3 was also examined. The experimental results showed that, for CaCO3 and CaSO4, the PESA with hyper-branched structure provides a scale inhibiting efficiency as high as 95.9% and 94.3%, respectively, at an inhibitor concentration of 15\u202fmg/L. In addition, the processes of crystal nucleation, growth and crystal morphology have been analyzed. The experimental results show that the PESA with hyper-branched structure not only prolongs the induction period of CaCO3 crystal nucleation, but also reduces the number of crystal nuclei and changes the size and morphology of the CaCO3 crystal. Moreover, the FTIR, SEM and XRD analyses showed that the PESA with hyper-branched structure can induce the irregularity of growing CaCO3 crystal, destroy the formation of crystals and change the polymorphs of calcium scale crystal.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the toxicity of MCNs to rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings. Two novel MCNs with different particle sizes (MCN1: 150 and MCN2: 80\u202fnm) were synthesized using the high-temperature pyrolysis method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectra.

The rice seedlings were hydroponically exposed to both MCN suspensions with concentrations of 0, 10, 50, 150\u202fmg/L for 20\u202fdays. Exposure to 150\u202fmg/L MCN1 resulted in more than 21% and 29% decrease in root length and in shoot length, respectively. MCN2 significantly reduced the root and shoot lengths by approximately 70% and 57% at the concentration of 150\u202fmg/L. Additionally, the concentrations of three endogenous phytohormones, including brassinolide (BR), indole propionic acid (IPA), and dihydrozeatinriboside (DHZR) in plant shoots were increased significantly compared with the control. Our findings illustrated that size-effects of MCNs contributed greatly in causing phytotoxicity to plants, which should have drawn our attention to the use of these novel ENMs in agriculture given the evidence of their potential risks to crops. More importantly, this is the first study on assessment of the phytotoxicity of MCNs to rice seedlings from the perspective of plant hormones.",

Since, the stability and solubility of photosensitizers (dyes) are increased in the presence of surfactant and these properties lead to enhance the electrical output of the photogalvanic cells. Therefore, here we have studied the extent of interaction of different dyes with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), find out the order of stability of dye\u2013SDS on the basis of magnitudes of shifting in \u03bbmax of dye monomer and try to correlate order of dye\u2013SDS interaction with already reported electrical output data of photogalvanic cells. Brilliant Cresyl Blue, Nile Blue O, Azur A and TB O have shown red shifting while Azur B, Azur C and MB have shown blue shifting in their \u03bbmax value with SDS, which indicates formation of dye\u2013surfactant complex. But, the extent of formation of complex for different dyes with SDS was different due to change in their alkyl groups. Dyes with red shifting have greater stability in excited state as well as higher electrical output data of the cell than dye with blue shifting. On the basis of both red and blue shifting, order of stability of dyes\u2013SDS complex was found as: Brilliant Cresyl Blue\u202f>\u202fToluidine Blue O\u202f>\u202fAzur A\u202f>\u202fNile Blue\u202f>\u202fAzur B\u202f>\u202fMethylene Blue\u202f>\u202fAzur C.

Various characterization and detailed experimental tests were conducted to probe the influence of catalyst preparation method.

Metal ion (M\u202f=\u202fCu2+, Fe3+, Cr3+, As2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Sb5+) captured from 10\u202f\u00b5M solution of its salt over Fl-DNA-APTES film was found to be more efficient towards metal ion removal (99% removal) than M-Fl interaction into DNA-APTES (80% removal) which in turn was better than M-Fl-DNA trapping into APTES (60% removal). M-Fl chelation was 1:1 for all the complexes and binding strength (Kb in M\u22121) was of the order of 103\u2013105 for different flavonoids (Fls) and the flavonoid-chelated metals (M-Fls). From the results, it was inferred that the nature of interaction between different constituents and metal chelation with the flavonoid are the key factors that affect the ion removal efficiency. It was also anticipated that any flavonoid can be used for ion removal process subject to its affinity strength towards the ion of interest. The work successfully demonstrated the usefulness of the method for ion removal in chemical, biological and environmental systems.",

Hence, non-toxic and environmentally friendly AuNPs synthesis methods are of special interest. Here, AuNPs were produced using four solutions of fermented grape juices. UV/Vis absorption spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy indicated that AuNPs synthesized with a solution based on semi-sweet red grapes were mostly spherical with narrow size distribution (average diameter of 82.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f36.2\u202fnm). AuNPs of similar spherical morphology but smaller size were obtained using a solution based on semi-dry red grapes (57.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f16.4\u202fnm). A large variety of AuNPs shapes and broader size distribution were produced when solutions based on semi-sweet or dry white grapes were applied.

Using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Au, C, and O were detected, confirming formation of biogenic AuNPs in all cases. Mie theory calculations for AuNPs synthesized with the aid of solutions based on red grapes suggest that their optical properties are different and best suited for distinct downstream applications. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and the Bertrand\u2019s method were used to examine bioactive compounds present in the solutions applied for synthesis. Phenolics, and to a lesser extent reducing sugars, were identified as likely playing a significant role in reduction and stabilization of the AuNPs.

Essential oils are complex mixtures comprising many single compounds. There are several methods for extracting the essential oils. Various researchers reported biological activities of essential oils. However, activities of the same essences are different from the extracted oils. This variation could be understood by studying the factors which influence the chemical composition of the essential oils, in particular under photochemical conditions.

     "abstract": "Selective production of hydrogen by oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM) was studied over Cu/SiO2 catalyst using fixed bed flow reactor. Textural and structural properties of the catalyst were analyzed by various instrumental methods. TPR analysis illustrates that the reduction temperature peak was observed between 510\u202fK and 532\u202fK at various copper loadings and calcination temperatures and the peaks shifted to higher temperature with increasing copper loading and calcination temperature. The XRD and XPS analysis demonstrates that the copper existed in different oxidation states at different conditions: Cu2O, Cu0, CuO and Cu(OH)2 in uncalcined sample; CuO in calcined sample: Cu2O and metallic Cu after reduction at 600\u202fK and Cu0 and CuO after catalytic test. TEM analysis reveals that at various copper loadings, the copper particle size is in the range between 3.0\u202fnm and 3.8\u202fnm. The Cu particle size after catalytic test increased from 3.6 to 4.8\u202fnm, which is due to the formation of oxides of copper as evidenced from XRD and XPS analysis. The catalytic performance at various Cu loadings shows that with increasing Cu loading from 4.7 to 17.3\u202fwt%, the activity increases and thereafter it decreases. Effect of calcination shows that the sample calcined at 673\u202fK exhibited high activity. The O2/CH3OH and H2O/CH3OH molar ratios play important role in reaction rate and product distribution. The optimum molar ratios of O2/CH3OH and H2O/CH3OH are 0.25 and 0.1, respectively. When the reaction temperature varied from 473 to 548\u202fK, the methanol conversion and H2 production rate are in the range of 21.9\u201397.5% and 1.2\u2013300.9\u202fmmol\u202fkg\u22121\u202fs\u22121, respectively.

     "abstract": "Pyrazoles and pyrazolones constitute a group of organic compounds that have various medical applications such as antimicrobial, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antioxidants. Pyrazolones can exist in different isomeric forms (CH, NH, OH) due to keto-enol, lactam-lactim and imine-enamine tautomerism. Determination of the most stable tautomeric form is thus important for understanding their biological roles at the molecular level. We performed a theoretical investigation of the structural and antioxidant properties of three synthetic pyrazolones (1\u20133), one synthetic pyrazole (4), one natural pyrazole (5) and two engineered hydroxyl derivatives of 1 (7, 8) and of 5 (9, 10) using the density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory in gas phase and in methanol (using the polarizable continuum model). It is found that substituents and solvents may influence the relative stability of pyrazolone isomers and that the CH tautomer is typically the least stable. Vertical ionization potentials, vertical electron affinities and X\u2013H bond dissociation energies (X\u202f=\u202fC, N, O, S) are calculated for the global minimum structures and compared with those of the standard antioxidant flavonoid quercetin (6). Calculations predict that compounds 1 and 5 have antioxidant activity similar to 6 and that their mono and dihydroxyl derivatives (7\u201310) are more efficient antioxidants. Results also indicate that compounds 1\u201310 preferably interact with free radicals adopting the H atom transfer rather than the sequential electron transfer proton transfer mechanism. The study gives insight into the structural requirements for the design of highly efficient antioxidants.",

By tuning the ratio of two emulsifiers, P4VP-b-PAzoMA could self-assemble into various morphologies including porous microspheres, tremella-like aggregates, bowl-like aggregates and wrinkled microspheres. The transformation of the morphologies could be ascribed to three major aspects: the stability of emulsified chloroform droplets, the permeation of water into chloroform and the dispersity of the interior water droplets with regard to different HLB values. Besides, the morphology could even be tuned by changing the block ratio and the concentration of P4VP-b-PAzoMA, and the HLB dependent morphology changing was also proved within other block ratio or different concentration.

The good optical transparency and mechanical strength at micro level was confirmed from optical and nanoindentation measurements using the Oliver\u2013Pharr method of the grown single crystals. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis was done to probe the thermal stability of the grown single crystals. Using the density functional theory (DFT) methods, we have not only investigated the GGP but also proposed GP molecule. Additionally, we have shed light on the molecular geometries, infrared and Raman spectra, linear and nonlinear optical properties of both GGP and GP at molecular level. The time dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approach was adopted to calculate the excitation energies of the molecules in different phases including gas, water, acetone, cyclohexane and chloroform as well.

     "abstract": "Catalytic decomposition of methane has been studied extensively as the production of hydrogen and formation of carbon nanotube is proven crucial from the scientific and technological point of view. In that context, variation of catalyst preparation procedure, calcination temperature and use of promoters could significantly alter the methane conversion, hydrogen yield and morphology of carbon nanotubes formed after the reaction. In this work, Ni promoted and unpromoted Fe/Al2O3 catalysts have been prepared by impregnation, sol\u2013gel and co-precipitation method with calcination at two different temperatures. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. The catalytic activity was tested for methane decomposition reaction. The catalytic activity was high when calcined at 500\u00a0\u00b0C temperature irrespective of the preparation method. However while calcined at high temperature the catalyst prepared by impregnation method showed a high activity. It is found from XRD and TPR characterization that disordered iron oxides supported on alumina play an important role for dissociative chemisorptions of methane generating molecular hydrogen. The transmission electron microscope technique results of the spent catalysts showed the formation of carbon nanotube which is having length of 32\u201334\u00a0nm. The Fe nanoparticles are present on the tip of the carbon nanotube and nanotube grows by contraction\u2013elongation mechanism. Among three different methodologies impregnation method was more effective to generate adequate active sites in the catalyst surface. The Ni promotion enhances the reducibility of Fe/Al2O3 oxides showing a higher catalytic activity. The catalyst is stable up to six hours on stream as observed in the activity results.",

Then, the adsorption geometries and energies of gases (H2, CH4, or CO2) on the B80 and AlB79 (amphoteric adsorbents) are explored. The Al atom enhances reactivity of the cage toward the gases and the adsorption processes are more exothermic with low and high energy barriers for chemisorption of H2 and CO2, respectively. Stable chemisorption of CO2 on the AlB79 is validated by the high adsorption energy and large charge transfer, while the CH4 is just physically adsorbed on the AlB79. Further, the physisorbed gases can enhance field emission current of the AlB79 and in the continuous capturing of the gases, the magnetic moment of the cage is quenched.

     "abstract": "The catalytic effect of copper(II) catalyst on the oxidation of l-tryptophan (Trp) by hexacyanoferrate(III) (HCF), has been investigated spectrophotometrically in an aqueous alkaline medium at a constant ionic strength of 0.5\u00a0mol\u00a0dm\u22123 and at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The stoichiometry for both the uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions was 1:2 (Trp:HCF). The reactions exhibited first order kinetics with respect to [HCF] and less than unit orders with respect to [Trp] and [OH\u2212]. The catalyzed reaction exhibited fractional-first order kinetics with respect to [CuII]. The reaction rates were found to increase as the ionic strength and dielectric constant of the reaction medium increase. The effect of temperature on the rates of reactions has also been studied, and the activation parameters associated with the rate-determining steps of the reactions have been evaluated and discussed. Addition of the reaction product HCF(II) to the reaction mixture did not affect the rates. Plausible mechanistic schemes for uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions explaining all of the observed kinetic results have been proposed. In both cases, the final oxidation products are identified as indole-3-acetaldehyde, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. The rate laws associated with the reactions\u2019 mechanisms are derived. The rate constants of the slow steps of the reactions along with the equilibrium constants are also calculated.",

The study was focused on the modification of synthesis conditions and effect of these modified conditions on the structural and electrical properties of synthesized MgFe2O4 ceramic materials. Phase composition, crystallinity, structure and surface morphology were studied by X-ray diffraction, FTIR and SEM. Pure single phase MgFe2O4 spinel ferrite was obtained after calcination at 850\u00a0\u00b0C. Rietveld refinement of XRD result confirmed the single cubic phase spinel oxide with the lattice constant of a\u00a0=\u00a08.3931\u00a0\u00c5 and Fd3m symmetry. UV\u2013visible absorption study of calcined powder revealed an optical band gap of 2.17\u00a0eV. SEM images of sintered specimens (1050\u20131450\u00a0\u00b0C) showed that the grain size increased with the increase in sintering temperature. From the impedance results of the sintered MgFe2O4 specimens, it was found that the resistance of grain, grain boundary and electrode effect decreased with an increase in sintering temperature and associated grain growth. In the intermediate frequency region lowering of impedance and dielectric values was observed due to the decrease in grain boundary areas. M\u00f6ssbauer studies indicated that magnesium ferrite had a mixed spinel structure in calcined and sintered samples, however, the well refined single phase MgFe2O4 was observed due to well developed high crystalline structure at 1350\u00a0\u00b0C and 1450\u00a0\u00b0C.",

Synthesized EAAgNPs generate the surface plasmonic resonance peak at 438\u00a0nm in UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer. Size and shape of EAAgNPs were further characterized through transmission electron microscope (TEM) which shows well-dispersed spherical nanoparticles with size ranging from 10 to 50\u00a0nm. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analysis (EDAX) confirms the presence of silver (Ag) as the major constituent element. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of EAAgNPs corresponding to (1\u00a01\u00a01), (2\u00a00\u00a00), (2\u00a02\u00a00) and (3\u00a01\u00a01) planes, reveals that the generated nanoparticles were face centered cubic crystalline in nature. Interestingly, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis shows the major role of active phenolic constituents in reduction and stabilization of EAAgNPs. Phyto-fabricated EAAgNPs exhibits significant antimicrobial and larvicidal activity against bacterial human pathogens as well as disease transmitting blood sucking parasites such as Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti (IIIrd instar larvae). On the other hand, in vitro cytotoxicity assessment of bioformulated EAAgNPs has shown potential anticancer activity against human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa). The preliminary biochemical (MTT assay) and microscopic studies depict that the synthesized EAAgNPs at minimal dosage (IC50\u00a0=\u00a028\u00a0\u03bcg) triggers cellular toxicity response. Hence, the EAAgNPs can be considered as an environmentally benign and non-toxic nanobiomaterial for biomedical applications.",

But bamboo is readily discoloured by mould fungi, which greatly limits the applications of bamboo. In this research, ZnO nanoparticles were successfully fabricated on the surface of bamboo timber by a simple low-temperature wet chemical method. The morphology, chemical structure, and crystalline structure of the samples were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). XRD studies confirmed that the as-prepared ZnO nanoparticles were wurtzite. The microstructure and hydroxyl groups in the bamboo timber surface at the wet state provided cavities and affinity for the creation and the immobilization of ZnO nanoparticles on the bamboo timber surface through electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Moreover, the mould-resistance of ZnO coated bamboo timber was also in focus on the present study. The results indicated that bamboo timber treated with ZnO had a better resistance against Aspergillus niger V.

     "abstract": "The effect of various factors on the catalytic performance of iso-butane formation over CuZnZrAl/Pd-\u03b2 hybrid catalyst via synthesis gas or CO2 hydrogenation has been deeply investigated in this work. It was interesting to note that the iso-butane/n-butane ratio value was much higher than that of thermodynamic equilibrium (about 1/1), whose value was directly related to the reaction condition using this hybrid catalyst. In order to further clearly clarify this finding, various experimental reaction factors were selected to investigate the formation of iso-butane. The results revealed that increasing temperature, H2/COx, CO2/COx, and/or Pd loading possessed an inhibiting effect on the iso-butane yield. High selectivity of iso-butane could be achieved by increasing the reaction pressure, W/F and the weight ratio of CuZnZrAl methanol catalyst to Pd-\u03b2 catalyst. It is also noted that the addition of water seriously suppressed the reaction activity, resulting in the low ratio of iso-butane/n-butane. A possible reaction route was elucidated based on the latest results. This might shed light on the development of a high efficient catalyst for iso-butane production from synthesis gas or CO2 hydrogenation.",

For TiO2 aerogel material (TA), the solvent was high temperature supercritically extracted at 300\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0bars. However, the TiO2 xerogel material (TX) was dried at 200\u00a0\u00b0C and ambient pressure. The effects of the drying processes on the crystalline structure, phase transformation and grain growth were determined by Raman spectroscopy, SAED and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses using Rietveld refinement method. The TiO2 aerogel was composed of anatase crystalline structure. The TiO2 xerogel material was composed of anatase, brookite and small amount of amorphous phase with anatase as dominant phase. The TX sample still contains a relatively high concentration of carbon than that of TA, indicating the amorphous character of TiO2 xerogel. These materials were applied as catalyst for the degradation of indigo carmine in aqueous medium. Photo-degradation ability of TA and TX was compared to the TiO2 commercial Degussa P25. The photo-catalytic results showed that the degradation efficiency was in the order TA\u00a0>\u00a0P25\u00a0>\u00a0TX. The photo-degradation of indigo carmine followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics.",

The study was extended to retrace the effect of different gamma irradiation doses on the size of prepared NPs. UV/vis. spectra showed a single peak at 531\u00a0nm attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of Au NPs. The blue shift of SPR peak after irradiation process indicated that gamma irradiation could be utilized as size control partner. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) showed a decrease in the size of Au NPs and a narrow size distribution with an increase in the gamma irradiation dose. Results of TEM were coinciding with those obtained from UV/vis. spectra.

With increasing annealing temperature, the Al contents in the thin films were continually increased, because of the rapid increase in the incorporation efficiency of the Al\u2013O layer with respect to the NiZn\u2013O layer. Polycrystalline nature of the thin films was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction technique. All films have a perfect wurtzite structure without any recordable variation in the ZnO lattice produced by replacing Zn with Ni and Al. The absorption edge shifted to a higher wavelength (red shift) with the increase of annealing temperature indicating that the shrinkage of the optical band gap was induced. The optical band gaps of thin films decreased from 3.5 to 2.5\u00a0eV. All films showed ferromagnetic behavior. The annealing process provided a reduced resistivity due to the improved crystal structure of films.",

Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the green synthesized Pd NPs was also tested toward the Suzuki coupling reactions of various aryl halides in aqueous media.

It was shown that the presence of the modifiers, either Ti or Al, facilitates the formation of the network structure and increases slightly the thermal stability of sol\u2013gel materials. SEM and TEM show that morphology is smooth and uniform by using low modifiers concentrations, while surface deterioration appears at higher concentrations. Gravimetric measurement, polarization and EIS show that the protection ability of GPTMS-VTMS sol\u2013gel is increased by being modified with low concentrations of Ti and Al moities. Protection efficiency value is 69.2% for unmodified film and increased to 96.2 and 95.8% by using 0.005\u00a0M of Ti and Al modifiers, respectively. This improvement is caused by both the non-permeable nature of the sol\u2013gel coating and the enhanced structure of the sol\u2013gel by the presence of Ti and Al modifiers.

For supercapacitor performance, three electrode systems was tested in aqueous H2SO4 for feasibility determination and showed electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) behaviour which is expected for activated carbon like materials.

The reaction parameters such as, catalyst weight, Au loading, calcination of Au/TiO2 catalysts and [H2O2]:[DBT] mole ratio are studied. The Au/TiO2 catalyst was synthesised by deposition\u2013precipitation method. The catalysts were characterized by ICPAES, XRD and TEM analysis. ICP-AES analysis demonstrate that with a nominal amount of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3\u00a0at.% of Au in a solution at pH 7, the amount of gold deposited on the TiO2 was 0.78, 1.42, 1.92, 2.45 and 2.87\u00a0at.% respectively. The average particle size of Au in the 2\u00a0at.% Au/TiO2 sample after drying was 3\u00a0nm and in the sample after calcination at 573\u00a0K was 5\u00a0nm. The XPS spectra of Au/TiO2 sample demonstrate that the sample dried at 373\u00a0K contains Au0 and Au3+ and the sample after calcination at 573\u00a0K contains Au0 and negligible amount of Au3+. The photocatalysis studies show that the Au nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated titania showed higher activity for the removal of DBT compared to pure titania. The optimum Au loading in Au/TiO2 for the photocatalytic removal of DBT was found to be 1.5\u00a0at.% Au. The Au NPs act as electron sink to enhance e/h+ charge separation and produce number of oxidizing species, thereby increase the reaction rate. The calcined catalyst sample showed higher activity toward DBT removal compared to the uncalcined sample. This is due to the presence of metallic gold in the calcined sample, which can effectively involve in the charge separation. The optimum catalyst weight for DBT removal was found to be 0.3\u00a0g of Au/TiO2 for 200\u00a0ml of DBT in isooctane (200\u00a0ppm\u00a0S). The optimum [H2O2]:[DBT] molar ratio was found to be 3. Comparison of photocatalytic removal of DBT and BT showed that the removal of DBT is faster than the BT.",

The physical and chemical properties of the residue catalyst were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements, energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) analysis and Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The maximum yield of methyl ester was obtained as 89\u00a0wt% with 3\u00a0h reaction time at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, 3.5\u00a0wt% catalyst and 1:15 oil\u2013methanol ratio. The obtained biodiesel was characterised by 1H NMR (Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). The fuel properties of methyl ester were analysed and found to be within the limit of ASTM.",

Castor oil was modified by triethanolamine by means of transesterification and designated as transesterified castor oil (TCO). The polyurethane network was prepared from transesterified castor oil (TCO) with the isophoronediisocyanates (IPDI) by using dibutyltindilaurate (DBTDL) as catalyst. Simultaneously styrene was added with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as initiator and N,N\u2032-Dimehtylaniline as coinitiator. Diallylphthalate was added as a crosslinking agent to form IPN and finally cast into films. To cast the film, the mixture (IPN) was poured in the glass cavity with pourable viscosity free from air bubbles. A series of two component interpenetrating polymer networks were prepared by varying % weight ratio of both polyurethane and polystyrene. These films were characterized by FT-IR, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), morphology was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FT-IR have given the conformation of IPN formation. DMA results have shown much increase in the value of tan\u00a0\u03b4 and a decrease in the value of Tg by increasing the anount of Styrene.",

     "abstract": "A kinetic spectrophotometric method for accurate and sensitive determination of gemifloxacin (GMFX) and gatifloxacin (GTFX) has been described. The method is based on the reaction of the studied drugs with potassium permanganate in the presence of sodium hydroxide to form a water-soluble green product which shows maximum absorbance at 604\u00a0nm. The determination of GMFX and GTFX drugs by rate constant, fixed-concentration, and fixed time methods was feasible with the calibration equations obtained but the fixed time method had been found to be more applicable. The concentration of the selected drugs is calculated using the calibration equation for the fixed time method. The absorbance\u2013concentration plot is linear over the range of 4\u201336\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u22121 and 4\u201340\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u22121 with correlation coefficient of 0.9998 and 0.9991, for GMFX and GTFX, respectively. The molar absorptivity, Sandell sensitivity, detection and quantification limits were also calculated. The different experimental parameters affecting the development and stability of the color were carefully studied and optimized. The intra- and inter-day RSD values indicated the ruggedness of the method. The proposed method has been successfully applied to pharmaceutical formulations of each drug. Statistical comparison of the results with a well established reported method showed excellent agreement and proved that there is no significant difference in the accuracy and precision.",

The synthesized complexes were structurally characterized by analytical, spectral (FT-IR, UV\u2013vis, 1H NMR, FAB-Mass, TGA/DTA and EPR) as well as molar conductance and magnetic studies. From spectral studies, both the ligands act as bidentate and they bind metal(II) ions through deprotonated-N3 and C4O atoms and amino-N and deprotonated carboxylato-O atoms, respectively, to form a stable metal chelate. The observed low molar conductance values suggest a non-electrolytic nature. Calculated g tensor values of Cu(II) complex (1d) at 77 and 300\u00a0K confirm their geometry. Thermal behavior of metal(II) complexes (1a\u20131c) shows loss of coordinated water molecules in the first step followed by decomposition of ligand moieties in a respective manner and leads to form air stable metal oxide as final residues. Powder X-ray diffraction and SEM studies illustrate that all the complexes have uniform microcrystalline with homogenous morphology. Mn(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes show significant in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities than 5-fluorouracil(A). Moreover, the nuclease studies of Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes (1c and 1d) show considerable DNA binding and oxidative DNA cleavage activities than other complexes.",

The method is based on the reaction of the amino group of cefixime with ninhydrin in an alkaline medium to form a yellow-colored derivative (\u03bbmax 436\u00a0nm). A two-level full factorial design was utilized to screen the effect of ninhydrin reagent concentration (X1), volume of ninhydrin reagent (X2), heating temperature (X3) and heating time (X4) on the formation of the cefixime\u2013ninhydrin complex Y (absorbance).

A Box-Behnken experimental design with response surface methodology was then utilized to evaluate the main, interaction and quadratic effects of these three factors on the selected response. With the help of a response surface plot and contour plot the optimum values of the selected factors were determined and used for further experiments. These values were a ninhydrin reagent concentration (X1) of 0.2% w/v, volume of ninhydrin reagent (X2) of 1\u00a0mL and heating temperature (X3) of 80\u00a0\u00b0C. The proposed method was validated according to the ICH Q2 (R1) method validation guidelines.

The cationic micelles of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) and cetyltrimethylammonium sulfate ((CTA)2SO4) enhanced the rate of hydrolysis of esters to a maximum value and thereafter, the increasing concentration of surfactant decreased the reaction rate.

The evaluated thermodynamic parameters (\u0394G, \u0394H and \u0394S) showed that the adsorption of Pb (II) ions onto nano NH2-HMS was feasible, spontaneous and endothermic in nature. It can be concluded that NH2-HMS is potentially able to remove Pb (II) ions from aqueous solutions. Also, more than 90% of desorption efficiency was achieved using 0.01\u00a0M HNO3.",

O. dilenii haw plant extract simplifies the process, provides an alternative process for a simple and an economical synthesis. The absence of surfactant has led to a simple, cheap and fast method of synthesis of NiAl2O4 nanoparticles. The as-synthesized NiAl2O4 nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies, high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), diffuses reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The XRD results confirmed the formation of the cubic phase NiAl2O4. The formation of pure nickel aluminate phase was confirmed by FT-IR. The formation of NiAl2O4 nanoparticles was confirmed by HR-SEM and HR-TEM and their possible formation mechanisms were also proposed. MCM could produce NiAl2O4 with uniform size and well-defined shape with crystallinity. The optical property was determined by DRS. NiAl2O4 prepared by the microwave combustion method was found to possess a higher surface area, lower crystallite size than the NiAl2O4 nanoparticles prepared by the conventional combustion method, which in turn has led to the improved performance toward the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.",

The ground and first excited state geometries were optimized by applying density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent DFT, respectively. The light has been shed on the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and observed comprehensible intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs). The absorption, emission, ionization potentials (IP), electron affinities (EA), total and partial densities of states and structure-property relationship have been discussed. Finally, hole as well as electron reorganization energies, transfer integrals and intrinsic mobilities have been calculated then charge transport behavior of STMI was discussed, intensively.",

Furthermore, TD-DFT calculations coupled with the polarizable conductor calculation model (PCM), performed on the most stable conformers in DMF to account for the solvent effect, revealed that the optical properties including \u03bbmax and oscillator strength performed on the most stable conformers were in excellent agreement with the experimental \u03bbmax and molar extinction coefficient, which clearly validate the most stable molecular conformers identified for compounds 4\u20139.

These characterization methods confirmed the difference between IIPs and non-imprinted polymers (NIP). From the adsorption studies done IIPs did not only show better adsorption than NIPs but also better selectivities as well. As adsorption using As-IIPs (AsAsIIPs) reached a maximum of 482\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 whilst Se adsorption using Se-IIPs (SeSeIIPs) reached a maximum of 447\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 after optimization of the sample pH, adsorption time and sample temperature. However these adsorption capacities were increased to 568\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 and 530\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 for As and Se respectively when column experiments were done at the same sample temperature and pH. Against Pb, Cd and Hg, As-IIPs and Se-IIPs showed selectivity towards As and Se, respectively.",

This article presents the abatements obtained in chemical pollution as monitored by complete chemical analysis. For the same experimental conditions (similar discharge water, pollutant concentrations, stirring rate, contact time, and initial pH), the highest levels of pollutant removal were attained with the combined use of two materials, an activated carbon and a mixture of two ion-exchange resins. This physicochemical treatment effectively lowered the main pollutants present in the discharge water such as Cu, Ni and COD, by more than 96%, 79% and 74% respectively (average values for three samples), while the treatment with carbon alone lowered them by 58%, 9% and 70%, and resins alone by 85%, 61% and 16%.

     "abstract": "Membrane adsorbents have emerged as effective engineering tools for the elimination of heavy metal ions from water resources. Our previous works presented novel modified chitosan/poly(vinyl) alcohol membrane adsorbents for Cu(II) adsorption from water. This communication presents an expert mathematical model to predict the equilibrium adsorption of Cu(II) using Least-Squares Support-Vector-Machine (LS-SVM) intelligent approach. The model has been developed and tested using a total set of 72 experimentally measured equilibrium adsorption data. Membrane types, initial ion concentrations and temperature were selected as input parameters for the model. Equilibrium adsorption results were assigned as output parameters. The data points were categorized into three random sets: 70% assigned for the model development, 15% for validation and the remaining 15% for verification of the model applicability. The statistical Leverage analysis was employed for the examination of the outlier and doubtful data. According to the Williams plot and Hat matrix, all the data fall within the ranges of 0\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0H\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a00.055 and \u22121\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0R\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a01. These ranges are much better confidence limits relative to the requirement of the model. The results show that the developed model is quite accurate and reliable with the average absolute relative deviation of 4.8% and correlation coefficients close to unity. In addition, it is obtained that the model can appropriately predict the actual trend of the equilibrium adsorption as a function of initial metal concentration at different temperatures.",

In the present study, tocol (tocopherol and tocotrienol), triacylglycerol, and fatty acid compositions, pigment content, thermal behavior, and various physicochemical properties of R. stricta oil were characterized to determine the potential uses of this seed oil. Our results indicate that the oil is a rich source of bioactive molecules, including \u03b4-tocopherol (896\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g), \u03b3-tocopherol (148\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g) and carotenoids (15.67\u00a0mg/kg). The oil content of the seeds was 13.68% and the triacylglycerols mainly consisted of linoleic acid (59.03%), and oleic acid (27.01%). The major triacylglycerols were trilinoleate, dilinoleate and monolinoleate. The ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids (UFA/SFA) in the oil was high (9.20). Additionally, the oil showed a high degree of thermal stability and a low melting point of approximately \u221225\u00a0\u00b0C. These data indicate that R. stricta seed oil, which is low in saturated fats and rich in bioactive compounds, is potentially useful in food and pharmaceutical applications.",

The spectrophotometric technique was adopted for the estimation of concentration of dye before and after the adsorption. The equilibrium data were applied on Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich isotherm models and the values of their corresponding constants were evaluated from the slopes and intercepts of their respective plots.

As part of our ongoing investigations into compounds with activity against malaria parasites, we tested the in vitro antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium falciparum strain namely; chloroquine-resistant W2 and chloroquine-sensitive D6. The methanolic root extract of the plant was active against the chloroquine-sensitive (IC50\u00a0=\u00a020.56\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and the chloroquine-resistant (IC50\u00a0=\u00a013.31\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) strains of P. falciparum. Two flavans 1 and 2 were purified, identified and further shown to be antiplasmodial. Compound 2 was more active than compound 1 against both strains of P. falciparum with IC50 values of 8.12\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (D6); 8.89\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (W2) and 26.02\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (D6); 25.97\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (W2), respectively.

A thin film of palladium-based membrane is employed to the displacement of the thermodynamic equilibrium for high conversion and yield. A mathematical model is developed to simulate the reformer. A substantial improvement of the CFFBMR is achieved by implementing the thin hydrogen membrane. The results showed that almost complete conversion of heptane and 46.25% increase of exit hydrogen yield over the value without membrane are achieved. Also a wide range of the H2/CO ratio within the recommended industrial range is obtained. The phenomena of high spikes of maximum nature at the beginning of the CFFBMR are observed and explanation offered. The sensitivity analysis results have shown that the increase of the steam to carbon feed ratio can increase the exit hydrogen yield up to 108.29%. It was found that the increase of reaction side pressure at a high steam to carbon feed ratio can increase further the exit hydrogen yield by 49.36% at a shorter reactor length. Moreover, the increase of reaction side pressure has an important impact in a significant decrease of the carbon dioxide and this is a positive sign for clean environment.",

The presence of new functional groups on the surface of TS\u2013ONa resulted in a dramatic increase of surface polarity and the density of sorption sites, thereby improving the sorption efficiency of the cationic dyes. The results obtained from the sorption characteristics have revealed that the sorption process for TS\u2013ONa was uniform and rapid. The adsorption of cationic dyes reached equilibrium within the first 10\u00a0min of contact time and the treated material acts efficiently in a wide pH range of dye solutions. The extent of adsorption was measured through equilibrium sorption isotherms and analyzed using the Langmuir model. The monolayer saturation capacities for Methylene Blue are 694.44 and 1928.31\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121 and for Methyl Green are 892.86 and 1821.33\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121 for TS\u2013OH and TS\u2013ONa, respectively. Therefore, the chemically treated sawdust proved two- to threefold higher adsorption capacities of these dyes than those of the untreated analog. The exothermic nature of adsorption is demonstrated by a decrease of adsorption capacity with increasing temperature, and the negative value of free energy change indicated the spontaneity of adsorption. Desorption experiments with 1\u00a0M aqueous NaCl put into evidence that cationic dyes were completely desorbed from the matrices and the reusability of the TS\u2013ONa matrix after three repeated cycles led to just a slight attenuation in its performance. These results show that alkaline treatment of a low value by-product of the timber industry leads to a powerful and efficient low-cost adsorbent, which may be used for the treatment of colored wastewaters.",

Thus, TRPM8 antagonists represent a new, novel and potentially useful treatment strategy to treat various disease states such as urological disorders, asthma, COPD, prostate and colon cancers, and painful conditions related to cold, such as cold allodynia and cold hyperalgesia. Better tools such as potent and specific TRPM8 antagonists are mandatory as high unmet medical need for such progress. To achieve this objective quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) studies were carried out on a series of 25 benzimidazole-containing TRPM8 antagonists to investigate the structural requirements of their inhibitory activity against cTRPM8.

After optimization of 3D geometry of structures by the semi-empirical quantum-chemical calculation at AM1 level, different descriptors were calculated by the HyperChem and Dragon softwares (1514 descriptors). A major problem of QSPR is the high dimensionality of the descriptor space; therefore, descriptor selection is the most important step.

It is referred to as semisolid\u2013liquid dispersive microextraction (SSLDM) and has the advantages of both dispersive liquid\u2013liquid microextraction (DLLME) and solid-phase extraction (SPE). The surface area of the droplets is large, so the equilibrium state is quickly reached. The high density of the gel facilitates phase separation, and disadvantages of existing methods are overcome in that there is no need for extraction and dispersive solvents (as in conventional DLLME) and no need for desorption (as in SPE). The SSLDM method integrates sampling, extraction and concentration into one single and solvent-free step. The method was exemplarily applied to the preconcentration of malachite green (MG) and crystal violet (CV) which then were quantified by spectrophotometry. Specifically, poly (styrene-alt-maleic acid), a pH-sensitive hydrogel, was used to extract MG and CV from water samples. The linear analytical range is from 0.01 to 1\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121 for MG, and from 0.05 to 1\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121 for CV.

The composition of the calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) is chemically and structurally similar to the bone mineral. Their surface reactivity is indeed linked to the existence of hydrated surface particles ( HPO 4 2 - and Ca2+). The adsorption kinetics is very fast while the release kinetics is relatively slow. The adsorption rate reached approximately 70%, but the release rate did not exceed 12%. The chemical composition of solution has an influence on the release processes. The presence of phosphate ions favored the release of amino acids, while the calcium ions inhibited it. Also, the release process is slightly influenced by Ra (ml/mg) ratio and incubation temperature of the medium. The charged \u2013COO\u2212 and NH 3 + of amino acids are the strongest groups that interact with the surface of hydroxyapatite, the adsorption is mainly due to the electrostatic interaction between the groups \u2013COO\u2212 of amino acids and calcium Ca2+ ions of the hydroxyapatite. dl-Leucine (non-polar) and l-Lysine (polar\u2013basic) interact with the hydroxyapatite surface in the zwitterionic and cationic forms, respectively.

Compared to the commercial Fe2O3 powder, the as-prepared porous Fe2O3 nanorods exhibited higher catalytic activities owing to their large surface areas and porous nanostructures. The photocatalytic reaction rate constant of the porous Fe2O3 nanorods in the photocatalytic decomposition of Rhodamine B under simulated solar light was calculated to be 0.0131\u00a0min\u22121. Moreover, the catalyst was found to have superior stability and reusability.",

     "abstract": "Polythiophene (PTh) has been the subject of considerable interest because of its good environmental stability, unique redox electrical behavior, stability in doped or neutral states, ease of synthesis, and wide range of applications in many fields. Apart from its applications in the electrical or electronic field, PTh has shown promising applications in photocatalytic degradation. The fabrication of a catalyst, metal oxides with PTh, extends the absorption range of the modified composite system, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity under UV or visible light irradiation. Substituted PTh, such as alkyl substitution, modifies the electronic properties of the polymer, thereby enlarging the potential for industrial applications. PTh or substituted PTh when combined with metal, metal oxide or a combination of both, can exhibit tailorable photocatalytic properties. This review focuses on the chemistry of the band gap engineering of PTh or PTh based systems and the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation. The major developments in the field of UV and visible light-assisted photocatalysis are discussed in terms of the parameters that affect the photocatalytic efficiency. On the other hand, some challenges still needs to be investigated experimentally, which are mentioned as the scope for future studies. For simplicity, the review has been classified under a major subheading depending on the type of composite system used for photocatalysis.",

In the present study, we have reported the photo catalytic degradation of a toxic organic dye, malachite green using a ZnO doped Dy2O3 photo catalyst under visible light irradiation. The nanocrystalline photocatalyst was prepared by a precipitation method employing the respective nitrates and sodium carbonate as precursors and were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, UV\u2013Vis DRS, FE-SEM and AFM analysis. The experimental results proved that the prepared photo catalysts were crystalline, nanosized and highly active in the visible region. UV\u2013Vis DRS results suggested that the band gap was 3.1\u00a0eV for the prepared photo catalyst. The photodegradation efficiency of malachite green was analysed by various experimental parameters namely pH, catalyst dosage, variation of substrate concentration and effect of electrolyte addition. The photo degradation process followed a pseudo first order kinetics and was continuously monitored by UV\u2013Visible spectrophotometer. The degradation of malachite green was above 99% within 1\u00a0h of visible light irradiation employing the doped photocatalyst, whereas pristine metal oxide possessed only 67% and pristine lanthanide oxide possessed activity which was only due to photolysis. A plausible mechanism for the generation of OH radicals and the pathway for MG dye degradation has been proposed in this study. The experimental results clearly show that nanocrystalline semiconductor doped lanthanide oxides are highly active under visible light irradiations and may find wider applications in environmental remediation technologies.",

     "abstract": "The formation of wormlike micelle and the following significant changes in rheological properties suffer misunderstanding from both theoretical and fundamental aspects. Recently, we have introduced a theory for interpreting such important phenomenon which is referred to as critical intermolecular forces (CIF). The theory has stated that the hydrophobic effect is the main factor for the formation of worm-like aggregates. Therefore, it seems interesting to check out the validity of this new physical insight through investigating the presence of benzene ring as less hydrophobic group in contrast to that of alkyl in surfactant tail. The mixture of anionic sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate (SDBS) and cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) shows a high dynamic viscosity peak at the ratio of 80/20 of 3\u00a0wt.% CTAB/SDBS indicating the formation of wormlike micelles. The thermodynamic properties have been evaluated for this mixture exhibiting good agreement with the rheological changes. Interestingly, the results show the presence of benzene ring (in SDBS) causing a negative effect towards the formation of one dimensional aggregate in contrast to previous results which support the proposed CIF theory. The presence of nonionic surfactant TritonX-100 in binary and ternary systems of SDBS and CTAB prohibits the formation of wormlike micelles.",

SEM investigations of coordination polymers were found in different shapes and sizes, though they are synthesized from a single ligand. Each metal ion is coordinated by a bis (bidentate) manner through oxygen atom of the carboxylato group and the nitrogen atom of an amide group of ligand and two aqua ligands by coordinated bond which formed 6-member heterocyclic ring. In the present article, the main aim of research study is to find out the comparative studies of coordination polymers such as thermogravimetry (TG), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), differential thermal analysis (DTA), electrical conductivity and morphology behaviour. Furthermore, the electrical conductivities of chelating ligand and coordination polymers were determined in the solid state powder form. The electrical conductivities measurements of undoped and doped ligand, coordination polymers were carried out at room temperature by the four probe technique using an electrometer. Thermal degradation studies of the coordination polymers have been carried out from a non-isothermal condition under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0min\u22121. The decomposition steps and thermal stabilities of these complexes were confirmed by thermal analysis techniques (TG/DTG/DTA).

To explore the mechanism, EFCL was further determined by chemical and antioxidant assays. Folin\u2013Ciocalteu colorimetric assay suggested that content of total phenolics was 93.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.56\u00a0mg catechin/g and HPLC analysis indicated a content of 10.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.44\u00a0mg/g as chlorogenic acid in EFCI.

The methods use N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as an analytical reagent, janus green (JG) and calmagite (CMG) as auxiliary reagents. All the three methods are indirect in which the unreacted NBS is determined after the reaction between RTB and NBS is judged complete by iodometric back titration (method A) or by reacting with a fixed amount of either janus green (method B) or calmagite (method C) followed by the measurement of absorbance at 620 nm (method B) or 540 nm (method C). Titrimetry allows the determination of 1\u201310 mg of RTB and follows a reaction stoichiometry of 1:3 (RTB:NBS), whereas spectrophotometric methods are applicable over the concentration ranges of 0.5\u20138.0 \u03bcg ml\u22121 in method B and 1.5\u201330.0 \u03bcg ml\u22121 in method C.

The accuracy and precision of the methods were studied on intra-day and inter-day basis. No interference was observed from common pharmaceutical adjuvants. Statistical comparison of the results with a reference method showed excellent agreement, and indicates no significant difference in accuracy and precision.

The continuous increase in the cloud point (CP) of drug by increase in inorganic salt concentration and the magnitude of increases rely upon the position of the salts in Hofmeister series and hydrated radii. The QABs also influence continuous increase in the CP, which is illustrated in terms of the alkyl chain length of peculiar QAB. The effect of amino acids on CP of the drug solution is dependent upon the characteristics (acidic, basic, polar or nonpolar) of particular amino acids. The overall behavior of additives has been analyzed and discussed on the basis of electrostatic repulsion or interaction, micellar growth, and mixed micelle formation between the ingredients. In addition to this, thermodynamic parameters are also evaluated.",

The Langmuir model described the sorption isotherm best with maximum monolayer sorption capacity of 120.50 mg g\u22121. Four kinetic models, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticle diffusion and Elovich were employed to explain the sorption mechanism. The kinetics of sorption data showed that the pseudo-second-order model is the best with correlation coefficient of 0.9946. The spontaneous and exothermic nature of the sorption process was revealed from thermodynamic investigations. The effect of some common alkali and alkaline earth metal ions were also studied which showed that the presence of these ions have no effect on the sorption of Ni (II).

Carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema was used as an acute anti-inflammatory model as well as adjuvant-induced arthritis as a chronic model. Hot plate test on rats and acetic acid (0.6%) writhing test were used as acute analgesic models while the plantar test using an infrared beam directed to the paw of arthritic rats was used as a chronic analgesic model. Antipyretic effect was evaluated using Brewer\u2019s yeast (44%) induced hyperthermia in rats while pylorus ligation was used as a model to evaluate the ulcerogenic effects. Meloxicam, octreotide and their combinations administered subcutaneously showed anti-inflammatory effects in both acute and chronic models.

In yeast-induced hyperthermia, only meloxicam has an antipyretic effect. Meloxicam resulted in profound gastric lesions and exerted deleterious effects on the gastric mucosa in pyloric-ligated rats. Octreotide did not cause any harmful effect on the gastric mucosa, besides; octreotide attenuated the harmful ulcerogenic effects of meloxicam when administered in combination with it.

The synthesized ligand and the metal(II) complexes were structurally characterized by analytical, spectral (FT-IR, UV\u2013vis., 1H NMR, FAB-Mass, TGA/DTA and EPR) as well as molar conductance and magnetic studies. All the complexes are non-electrolytes having 1:2 stoichiometry. They adopt tetrahedral and octahedral geometry. Thermal behavior of metal(II) complexes (1a\u20131c) shows loss of coordinated water molecules in the first step followed by the decomposition of ligand moieties in a respective manner and leads to form an air stable metal oxide as the final residue. Micro crystalline nature and the presence of coordinated water molecules have been confirmed by powder XRD, SEM and thermal analyses.

The objective of this study is to assess the uptake of Cu2+ from aqueous solutions onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). The potential of the t-MWCNT to remove Cu2+ cations from aqueous solutions was investigated in batch reactor under different experimental conditions. The processing parameters such as initial concentration of Cu2+ ions, temperature, and adsorbent mass were also investigated. Copper uptake was quantitatively evaluated using the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin\u2013Kaganer\u2013Radushkevich (DKR) models. In addition, the adsorption equilibrium was described well by the Langmuir isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacity of 12.34\u00a0mg/g of Cu2+ cations on t-MWCNT. Various thermodynamic parameters, such as \u0394G0, \u0394H0 and \u0394S0 were calculated. The thermodynamics of Cu2+ cations adsorption onto t-MWCNT system pointed at spontaneous and endothermic nature of the process.

The biosorbent MLB was characterized by FTIR analysis. The extent of biosorption of Ni(II) ions was found to be dependent on solution pH, initial nickel ions concentration, biosorbent dose, contact time, and temperature. The experimental equilibrium biosorption data were analyzed by three widely used two-parameters Langmuir, Temkin and Freundlich isotherm models. Langmuir and Temkin isotherm models provided a better fit with the experimental data than Freundlich isotherm model by high correlation coefficients R2. The maximum adsorption capacity was 27.548\u00a0mg/g of Ni(II) ions onto MLB. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that the biosorption behavior of nickel ions onto MLB biosorbent was an endothermic process, resulting in higher biosorption capacities at higher temperatures.

Whereas the thiomethyl groups in such compounds increased the antioxidant property than the thiol group, the corresponding thiobenzyl groups did the reverse. The results can be explained, based on correlating the electron donating and withdrawing abilities of the substituents with the oxidation stability. The triazoles carrying a phenolic hydroxyl group have more antioxidant power than those without such a group. The imidazoles gave the oils more oxidation stabilities than the two types of triazoles with the same functionalities. The 4,5-diphenyl-2-thiomethyl-imidazole (2), as an additive, has the highest antioxidant property, reaching the level of standard one when its concentration is 1.0% wt. instead of the 0.8% wt. of the standard. The correlation of the antioxidant character of the heterocyclic additives with their structures has been investigated using the semiempirical gas phase AM1 calculations for the studied heterocycles. The relative stability of the imidazoles 1 and 3 compared to 2 were in the order 2\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0>\u00a03.

The presence of A. sativum enhanced more pH reduction for camel-MY than for cow-MY compared to their respective controls during storage. The reverse was true for total titratable acid.

The potential of the adsorption of oxygen on aluminum was examined as a function of both surface coverage and adsorption site. The relative stabilities of oxygen chemisorptions were independent of both the transition metal surface and surface coverage. That is, oxygen exhibited insignificant selectivity with respect to positions on the metal surface. Our data O2/Al surface chemisorptions revealed that the stables model for oxygen adsorption was that on the top site. The top site approach is important for the chemisorption processes because the adsorption energy for this model was lower than for the other sites.

Generally, the number of composite polystyrene microparticles (PS) increased and their sizes decreased with the content of solid nanoparticles used in stabilizing the precursor o/w emulsions. This is consistent with the formation of rigid layer(s) of the inorganic nanoparticles around the PS microparticles thus a better stability was achieved. The composite microparticles were characterized using various techniques such as surface charge, stability, transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR).

Two orientations of hydrogen were used on the concave and convex sides of corannulene. It was seen that binding to the concave face is favored relative to the convex face. The average binding energy was calculated and corrected for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) using the counterpoise method. Results showed that binding energy varies depending upon the site and side of absorption. The electronic density, charge transfer and spatial prohibition of the substituted groups affects the binding energy. The increment of the electronic density because of the substitution of electron donor groups facilitates hydrogen adsorption and leads to larger binding energies than when H atoms are substituted by electron acceptor groups. Substitution of H atoms with each of the considered groups leads to decreasing of the HOMO\u2013LUMO energy gap and so decreasing of the kinetic stability and increasing of the reactivity.

The ignition reliability of compositions based on this material is not very high and needs to be improved. In the present work, modified barium nitrate with micro porous structure has been synthesized using three different vesicants to make it more reliable as a pyrotechnic oxidant. Two pyrotechnic compositions were formulated by using pure and modified barium nitrate as oxidant and micro sized aluminum powder was used as a fuel. The ignition temperature of both the compositions was determined using differential thermal analysis. The composition formulated with the modified oxidizer ignited at lower temperatures as compared to the one formulated with pure barium nitrate depicting an improvement in the ignition behavior. SEM results show that the modified barium nitrate has obvious pores of the order of few micrometers. Bulk density of the modified oxidizer decreased due to the development of micro pores. Crystallite size of the barium nitrate also decreased after the modification.",

The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that AgBr nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surface of supporting materials. AgBr/CNT and AgBr/GP had a relatively higher reduction yield under visible light due to the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of well-dispersed AgBr to carbon supporting materials. In addition, the carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites were stable in the repeated uses under visible light. The total product yields of carbon-based AgBr nanocomposites after the 5 repeated uses almost remained about 83% of the first run.

     "abstract": "In this study, laponite and montmorillonite clays were found to be able to decompose rhodamine B upon visible light irradiation (\u03bb > 420 nm). Very interestingly, it was found that rhodamine B on laponite underwent a stepwise N-deethylation and its decomposition was terminated once rhodamine 110, as a decomposition product, was formed, whereas the same phenomenon was not observed for rhodamine B on montmorillonite, whose decomposition involved chromophore destruction. Mechanistic study revealed that the different photodecomposition behaviors of rhodamine B on laponite and montmorillonite were attributed to the oxidation by different reactive oxygen species, with laponite involving HO 2 / O 2 - while montmorillonite involving OH. It was also found that the degradation pathway of rhodamine B on laponite switched from N-deethylation to chromophore destruction when solution pH was changed from 7.0 to 3.0, which was attributed to a much higher fraction of HO 2 relative to O 2 - under pH 3.0 than under pH 7.0. Based on the results, a mechanism of rhodamine dye decomposition on clay under visible light was proposed, involving the clay as an electron acceptor, electron relay between the adsorbed dye molecules and oxygen molecules, and subsequent reactions between the generated dye radical cations and different reactive oxygen species. The results of this study shed light on how to best utilize visible light for organic pollutant degradation on clays within engineered treatment systems as well as on many of naturally occurring pollutant degradation processes in soils and air involving clay.",

Taking Rhodamine B as a model pollutant, this study points out an alternative route to enhance photodegradation in invisible light, which consumes energy to synthesize, but addition of 0.1 mM of I\u2212 or S2O32\u2212 increases the discoloration by up to three folds. For example, KI increased degradation to 36% while Na2S2O3 enhanced it by 61%, which was higher than that of pure n-TiO2 after sun light irradiation of 40 min. The enhancement of degradation by I\u2212 and S2O32\u2212 may be linked to the scavenging of the holes by the inorganic anions, thus inhibiting recombination between h+/e\u2212 after excitation of the semiconductor. The degradation is more effective in the presence of S2O32\u2212. In the presence of 0.1 mM KI, the rate constant increased from 0.0231 s\u22121 to 0.0325 s\u22121.Peroxodisulphate increases degradation, however, this is attributed to the sulfate radicals.",

Thermal behaviour (TG/DTA) and kinetic parameters calculated by the Coats\u2013Redfern and Horowitz\u2013Metzger method suggest more ordered activated state in complex formation. To investigate the relationship between stability constants of metal complexes and antimicrobial activity, the dissociation constants of Schiff bases and stability constants of their binary metal complexes have been determined potentiometrically in THF\u2013water (60:40%) solution at 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C and at 0.1 M NaClO4 ionic strength. The potentiometric study suggests 1:1 and 1:2 complexation. Antibacterial and antifungal activities in vitro were performed against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma, respectively. The stability constants of the metal complexes were calculated by the Irving\u2013Rosotti method. A relation between the stability constant and antimicrobial activity of complexes has been discussed. It is observed that the activity enhances upon complexation and the order of antifungal activity is in accordance with stability order of metal ions.",

The compounds in the selected series were characterized by spatial, molecular and electro topological descriptors using QSAR module of Molecular Design Suite (VLife MDS\u2122 3.5). The best 2D QSAR model was selected, having correlation coefficient r2 (0.8056) and cross validated squared correlation coefficient q2 (0.6742) with external predictive ability of pred_r2 0.7583 coefficient of correlation of predicted data set (pred_r2se) 0.2165. The results obtained from QSAR studies could be used in designing better Ang II activity among the congeners in future. The optimum QSAR model showed that the parameters SsssCHE index, SddCE-index, T_2_Cl_4, and SssNHE-index contributed in the model. 3D QSAR analysis by kNN-molecular field analysis approach developed based on principles of the k-nearest neighbor method combined with Genetic algorithms, stepwise forward variable selection approach; a leave-one-out cross-validated correlation coefficient (q2) of 0.6516 and a non-cross-validated correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.8316 and pred_r2 0.6954 were obtained. Contour maps using this approach showed that steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic field effects dominantly determine binding affinities. The information rendered by 3D QSAR models may lead to a better understanding of structural requirements of Angiotensin II receptor and can help in the design of novel potent antihypertensive molecules.",

The data obtained allowed the determination of the metal surface area, S (m2/g); the percentage of metal distribution, R; and the diameter of metal crystallite, d (nm). The amount of surface acidity, measured in mmol/g, was determined from the amount of chemisorbed pyridine necessary to completely inhibit the catalytic dehydration (DHD) of isopropanol. The conversion of isopropanol at 533\u2013623 K was investigated using the micro-catalytic pulse technique. DTA, XRD and FTIR indicated that NiO and CuO exist as separate phases with crystallite sizes too small to be detected.

Conversion of iso-propanol to propene proceeded via (DHD) on surface acid sites, and conversion of isopropanol to acetone proceeded via dehydrogenation (DHG) on redox sites.

Among these three methods, multiple linear regression (MLR) method has come out with a very promising result as compared to other two methods. According to Model-1 by MLR anticancer activity of quinazoline derivatives were influenced by individual (H-donor count, and XlogP) and alignment independent descriptor (T_C_Br_1, T_2_O_1 and T_2_N_7) help in understanding the effect of substituent at different position of quinazolines.

Molecular field analysis was applied for the generation of steric and electrostatic descriptors based on aligned structures. Steric and electrostatic field effects are discussed in the light of contribution plot generated. Finally, molecular docking analysis was carried out to better understand the interactions between EGFR target and inhibitors in this series. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions lead to identification of active binding sites of EGFR protein in the docked complex. The present study is more versatile than the earlier reported methods. Hence the model proposed in this work can be employed to design new derivatives of quinazoline with specific tyrosine kinase (EGFR) inhibitory activity.",

The X-band ESR spectra of the copper complexes in DMSO solution at 300 and 77\u00a0K were recorded and their salient features are reported. The in vitro biological screening effects of the investigated compounds were tested against the bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungal species, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus flavus, Rhizoctonia bataicola and Candida albicans by serial dilution method. A comparative study of inhibition values of the Schiff base ligands and their complexes indicate that the complexes exhibit higher antimicrobial activity than the Schiff base ligands. Superoxide dismutase and reducing power activities of the copper complexes have also been studied.

Partial least square methodology coupled with various feature selection methods, viz. stepwise (SW), genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) were applied to derive QSAR models which were further validated for statistical significance and predictive ability by internal and external validation. By using kNN-MFA approach, various 3D QSAR models were generated to study the effect of steric, electrostatic and hydrophobic descriptors on Ang II activity. The best model B with good external and internal predictivity for the training and test set has shown cross-validation (q2) and external validation (pred_r2) values of 0.8269 and 0.7647, respectively. For this model training and test sets were selected using sphere exclusion method and the descriptors were selected using simulated annealing method.

A rigorous steady state mathematical model based on the dusty gas model is implemented for the simulation. The simulation results reveal that the introduction of the concept of the reaction coupling has significant effect on the displacement of the thermodynamic equilibrium and considerable enhancement of simultaneous production of styrene and cyclohexane. Almost 100% conversion of the ethylbenzene and benzene is achieved through the application of this approach. It is also found that considerable decrease in the reactor length is achieved by employing a reactor catalyst bed with different bed compositions. Effective operating regions with optimal conditions are observed. An effective reactor length criterion is used to evaluate the performance of the reactor under these optimal conditions. The effective reactor length is found to be sensitive and favored by high feed temperature and pressure. The sensitivity analysis shows that the key parameters of feed temperature, pressure, and the bed composition play an important role on the reactor performance. The results also show that almost 100% conversion of ethylbenzene and benzene at low temperature and shorter reactor length can be achieved by maintaining the reactor beds at different temperatures. This temperature switching policy may result in appreciable energy saving. Moreover, operating the reactor at low temperature protect the catalyst from the excessive temperatures which have destructive effects on the catalysts and the mechanical stability of the reactors. Also, the low temperature operation has significant contribution to the reduction of the operating cost.",

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a common disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide and it can be considered one of the most important common diseases in the world. Treatment of peptic ulcers depends on using a number of synthetic drugs that reduce the rate of stomach acid secretion (Antiacids), protect the mucous tissues that line the stomach and upper portion of the small intestine (Demulcents) or to eliminate Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). In most cases, incidence of relapses and adverse reactions is seen in the following synthetic antiulcer therapy. Accordingly, the main concern of the current article is to introduce a safe drug (or more) of natural origin, to be used for the management of gastric ulcers without side effects.A widespread search has been launched to identify new anti-ulcer therapies from natural sources. Herbs, medicinal plants, spices, vegetables and crude drug substances are considered to be a potential source to control various diseases including gastric ulcer and ulcerative colitis. In the scientific literature, a large number of medicinal plants and their secondary metabolites with potential anti-ulcer (anti-peptic ulcer and antiulcerative colitis) activities have been reported. Treatment with natural products produces promising results and fewer side effects. Our goal is to collect the published data in the last 24 years and reviews the natural products reported in the treatment of these diseases and their mechanism of action.",

     "abstract": "The results of experimental investigation on the study of dissolution kinetics of a Nigerian galena ore in hydrochloric acid solution were discussed. The influence of acid concentration, temperature, particle size, stirring speed and solid/liquid ratio on the extent of dissolution was examined. The elemental analysis by XRF showed that the galena ore is composed mainly of PbS with metals such as Sn, Fe and Zn occurring as minor elements and Mn, Rb, Sr and Nb as traces. The XRD analysis indicated galena as the dominant mineral phase, with the presence of associated minerals, such as \u03b1-quartz (SiO2), sphalerite (ZnS), cassiterite (SnO2), pyrite (FeS2) and manganese oxide (MnO2).Results of leaching studies showed that galena dissolution in HCl solution increases with increasing acid concentration and temperature; while it decreases with particle diameter and solid/liquid ratio at a fixed stirring rate of 450 rpm. The study showed that 94.8% of galena was dissolved by 8.06 M HCl at 80 \u00b0C within 120 min with initial solid/liquid ratio of 10 g/L. The corresponding activation energy, Ea was calculated to be 38.74 kJ/mol. Other parameters such as reaction order, Arrhenius constants, reaction and dissociation constants were calculated to be 0.28, 73.69 s\u22121, 1.73 \u00b1 0.13 \u00d7 103 and 1.37 \u00b1 0.024 \u00d7 104 mol L\u22121 s\u22121, respectively. The mechanism of dissolution of galena was established to follow the shrinking core model for the diffusion controlled mechanism with surface chemical reaction as the rate controlling step for the dissolution process. Finally, the XRD analysis of the post-leaching residue showed the presence of elemental sulphur, lead chloride and \u03b1-quartz.",

The first-order-rate is observed with respect to [MnO2], whereas fractional-order-rates are determined in both [Gly-Leu] and [HClO4]. Addition of sodium pyrophosphate and sodium fluoride enhanced the rate of the reaction. Further, the use of surfactant micelles is highlighted as, in favourable cases, the micelles help the redox reactions by bringing the reactants into a close proximity due to hydrogen bonding. While the ionic surfactants SDS and CTAB have not shown any effect on the reaction rate, the nonionic surfactant TX-100 has catalytic effect which is explained in terms of the mathematical model proposed by Tuncay et al.

     "abstract": "In many oil production sites water injection is used as a piston to push the crude out of the well. As the age of the field progresses, the ratio of water to oil produced increases. Agitation of a water and crude oil mixture may give stable water-in-oil emulsion in which the water remains dispersed for a long period of time. These emulsions can cause severe problems in production and transport processes since they normally possess high stability and viscosity. The most important water properties which may contribute to the emulsion stability include pH and additive content. In this study, we report on the effect of both, water pH and the presence of surfactant molecules (anionic, cationic or non-ionic) on the stability of an Algerian crude oil (Haoudh el Hamra well) aqueous emulsion prepared by a mechanical agitation procedure. The stability was followed by the test-bottle method to measure the resolved water separated from the emulsion, and optical microscopy to visualize the dispersed water droplets in the oil phase. The results of the effects of varying the aqueous-phase pH suggest that the neutral medium is more efficient than acidic or basic environment for stabilizing the emulsions. The addition of non-ionic surfactants has a better potential to improve crude oil emulsion stability with respect to both cationic and anionic surfactants which do not show any improvement in the oil/water phase compatibility.",

Therefore, the search for new, more versatile and low-cost reagents becomes a great challenge. Several comprehensive review articles summarized the great effort undertaken, but up to now, no versatile coupling reagent useful for both amide and ester bond formation, as well as for solution and solid-phase peptide synthesis has been yet developed.

Infrared spectral data agreed with the coordination to the central metal ion through deprotonated phenolic oxygen and azomethine nitrogen atoms.

The amino acid profiles of the investigated fungi were varied and could be used for identification and characterisation of certain Fusarium species. Addition of certain chemical compounds including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, methionine, selenium, and urea to the growth medium affected the amino acid profiles. However, susceptibility of amino acid content to environmental conditions increased the variation of amino acid profiles among all the investigated Fusarium species. Some amino acids were only produced when certain chemical compounds were added to the growth medium. Valine was produced by F. anthophilum only in the presence of aspartic acid or selenium, while serine was produced in the presence of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or methionine.

From the taxonomic features, the bacterial isolate AZ-SH-B8 matches with Pseudomonas aeurginosa in the morphological, physiological and biochemical characters and confirmation by using API20E system. Thus, it was given the suggested name P. aeurginosa, AZ-SH-B8. The parameters controlling the biosynthetic process of antimicrobial agent formation includes: innoculum size, different pH values, different temperatures, different incubation period, different carbon and nitrogen sources and different mineral salts concentrations (KNO3, K2HPO4, MgSO4\u00b77H2O and KCl) were fully investigated.

A set of N reversible reactions, in a given mechanism, is considered as 2N elementary reactions in the KMC method, but in the NEKMC method just N reactions are considered. For each reversible reaction, the net-probability can be calculated by using the absolute value of the difference between the rates of the forward and the reverse reaction. By doing this, the number of events is divided by two and should reduce consequently the calculation time.

     "abstract": "Raw bentonite (RB) from Saudi Arabia was grinded at different time (30, 60 and 120\u00a0min) to evaluate stability changes of bentonite suspension due to induced progressive mechanical grinding. The mean particle size as well as the surface area and the zeta-potential (\u03b6) of the ground samples (G30, G60 and G120) were analyzed. Using the zeta-potential values, the maximum total interaction (VT/kTmax) between bentonite particles were calculated using DLVO theory to study the effect of grinding time on the stability of bentonite suspensions. The zeta potential of bentonite suspension in presence of different NaCl concentration was also investigated before and after mechanical grinding.With increasing grinding time the bentonite retained its crystalline structure as indicated from FTIR spectroscopy experiments. A reduction in the mean particle size of bentonite leading to increasing the specific surface and the \u03b6-potential by grinding continued up to about 60\u00a0min. After 60\u00a0min of grinding (120\u00a0min), the mean particles size increased, so the surface area and the zeta potential decreased as a result of particles starting a reaggregation process in which adhesion forces act. The zeta potential of ground bentonite suspension (G30, G60 and G120) in the presence of different concentrations of NaCl has higher values compared to RB. As the time of grinding increases, the (VT/kTmax) increases from 1102 for RB suspension to 2476 KT for G60 suspension; that is, the maxima of the total interaction energies increases\u00a0\u2248\u00a02.5 times more than that of the RB suspension. In conclusion the grinding of Saudi bentonite is easier to make down as a stable suspension than raw bentonite and that it displays better physical and chemical properties for new application purposes.",

The worldwide contamination of foods and feeds with mycotoxins is a significant problem. Aflatoxins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes, zearalenone, fumonisins, tremorgenic toxins, and ergot alkaloids are the mycotoxins of greatest agro-economic importance. Some molds are capable of producing more than one mycotoxin and some mycotoxins are produced by more than one fungal species. Often more than one mycotoxin is found on a contaminated substrate. Mycotoxins occur more frequently in areas with a hot and humid climate, favourable for the growth of molds, they can also be found in temperate zones. Exposure to mycotoxins is mostly by ingestion, but also occurs by the dermal and inhalation routes. The diseases caused by exposure to mycotoxins are known as mycotoxicoses. However, mycotoxicoses often remain unrecognized by medical professionals, except when large numbers of people are involved. Factors influencing the presence of mycotoxins in foods or feeds include environmental conditions related to storage that can be controlled. Other extrinsic factors such as climate or intrinsic factors such as fungal strain specificity, strain variation, and instability of toxigenic properties are more difficult to control. Mycotoxins have various acute and chronic effects on humans and animals (especially monogastrics) depending on species and susceptibility of an animal within a species. Ruminants have, however, generally been more resistant to the adverse effects of mycotoxins. This is because the rumen microbiota is capable of degrading mycotoxins. The economic impact of mycotoxins include loss of human and animal life, increased health care and veterinary care costs, reduced livestock production, disposal of contaminated foods and feeds, and investment in research and applications to reduce severity of the mycotoxin problem. Although efforts have continued internationally to set guidelines to control mycotoxins, practical measures have not been adequately implemented.",

The demisters performances were evaluated by droplet collection efficiency as a function of wide ranges of operating and design parameters. These parameters include: droplet size exiting the demister (250\u2013380\u00a0\u03bcm), specific surface area (236\u2013868\u00a0m2/m3), void fraction (97\u201398.3%), wire diameter (0.14\u20130.28\u00a0mm), packing density (130\u2013240\u00a0kg/m3), and superficial gas velocity (0.109\u20130.118\u00a0m/s. All demisters were 15\u00a0cm in diameter with 10\u00a0cm pad thickness, made from 316L stainless steel layered type demister pad wires. Experiments were carried out using air\u2013water system at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. The experimental data on the droplet removal efficiency were obtained using Malvern Laser Droplet Sizer. The removal efficiency was found to increase with the increasing the demister specific surface area, packing density, and superficial gas velocity. In contrast, the removal efficiency was found to increase with decreasing the demister void fraction and wire diameter. The separation efficiency is correlated empirically as a function of the design parameters. A good agreement was obtained between the measured values and the correlation predictions with \u00b15% accuracy.",

Paracetamol was separated on silica gel using the mixture of the mobile phase, ethyl acetate: benzene: acetic acid in a ratio (1:1:0.05\u00a0v/v/v).Absorbance measurements (detection of reflectance) of the separated drug were carried out at 250\u00a0nm. Calibration curves were established in the concentration range of 5\u201320\u00a0mcg/spot for paracetamol. Quantitation is achieved by comparing the area under the peaks obtained from scanning the thin layer chromatographic plates in a spectrodensitometer. The method has been successfully applied to pharmaceutical preparations (capsules) and the results obtained were statistically compared with those obtained by applying the reference method.",

     "abstract": "In this report, the use of a simple and versatile technique of templated electrodeposition through colloidal templates to produce nanostructured films of Pt and Au with regular submicron spherical holes arranged in a hexagonal close-packed structure is described. The templates were produced by self assembly of a monodispersed suspension of polystyrene spheres on gold substrates using capillary forces. The self assembly process was modified through the chemical modification of the gold substrate with cysteamine thiol. Films of Pt and Au were prepared by electrochemical deposition through the template. The electrochemical deposition charge and the current time curve were used to control the film height with a precision of approximately 10\u00a0nm. The colour of the nanostructured films changed as the film thickness was changed. On the other hand, high surface area of the nanostructured Pt film on top of the gold substrate was calculated using electrochemical cyclic voltammogram. About 55 roughness factor was obtained. SAXS measurements showed strong scattering at low angles indicating the presence of a well-ordered mesostructure.",

The nanocrystalline NiFe2O4 based sorbents were prepared using the combustion route. The effect of fuel content on the surface properties and desulferization activity of Ni/Fe mixed oxide sorbents has been studied.It was observed that incorporation of metal cations (Ni2+) into the hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3) crystal structure alters the surface properties and desulferization activity of the investigated oxides, which in turn depends on the nature and concentration of the incorporated metal cation and the released heat during the combustion process. The effect of fuel content in modifying the resultant surface area could be directly related to the variations in the rate of crystal growth of the solids studied depending upon preparation temperature. Interestingly, all the prepared ferrites exhibit a narrow pore size distribution in the range of 0.9\u20132\u00a0nm. The capacity of NiFe2O4 to adsorb sulfur from commercial kerosene was evaluated in terms of their textural and chemical characteristics.",

The area is surrounded by major highways that get congested with traffic at peak hours of the day. The objectives of this work were: to monitor ambient tropospheric levels of O3 and its precursors both for test comparing such levels to international standard limits and for assessing their health effects, to understand their diurnal behaviors, and to study their seasonal trends. The results of this study indicated that O3, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) exceeded the ambient air quality standards during specific times of the year. The diurnal patterns for NO2 and NMHC showed three peaks which were directly dependent on high traffic density, while only two daily maxima were observed in the case of O3. Finally, O3 compared to its precursors exhibited a completely opposite monthly mean distribution with the highest concentration levels detected during the summer season (July and August).",

All extracts were also subjected to phytochemical analysis and their toxic potential. Petroleum ether extract was found to contain steroids; alcohol extract revealed the presence of isoflavonoids, alkaloids and carbohydrates; while aqueous extract was found to contain amino acids, carbohydrates and flavonoids. S. conferta aqueous and alcoholic extracts were found to be non-toxic up to 5000\u00a0mg/kg dose level while petroleum ether extract was safe only up to a dose of 2000\u00a0mg/kg after single dose administration of the extracts.During confirmation of the claimed anti-ulcer activity, treatment with aqueous and alcoholic extracts showed significant reduction in ulcer index, free acidity as well as total acidity in pylorus ligated rats. However, petroleum ether extract showed relatively less profound reduction in all these indices. The anti-ulcer activity observed in aqueous extract treatment group was nearly equivalent to the standard group.",

The current potential data, peak separation (AE) and the peak current ratio (ipa/ipc) of the (Mn, Cu and Cd) complexes indicate that the charge transfer processes are irreversible, the systems are diffusion controlled and also adsorptive controlled. The charge transfer rate constant of metals in their complexes are less than those in their metal salts at identical experimental conditions due to the coordination of metal with methionine.",

In each case, blood sample was analyzed for serum cholesterol level and platelet count to establish a correlation between such parameters with paraesitemia. Based on the results obtained, it was evident that there was a highly significant reduction in the serum cholesterol level and the platelet count in malaria patients having high levels of parasitaemia.
