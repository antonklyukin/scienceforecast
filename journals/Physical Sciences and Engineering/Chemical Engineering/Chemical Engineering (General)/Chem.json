Because of the extremely weak interlayer coupling, it renders ReS2 to be well utilized without precise control in layer numbers. Here, from the perspective of weak interlayer coupling, recent advances in the emerging applications of ReS2, including rechargeable batteries, catalytic reactions, stimuli-responsive devices, and other applications, are discussed in detail.

The major light-harvesting complex of green plants (LHCII) contains four Cars, each within its own protein pocket with distinct structure and energetics. The photophysics of the Cars, including the balance of their diverse roles, remain unresolved because of the complexity of their electronic structure. We performed ultrabroadband two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy on LHCII with the spectral bandwidth and temporal resolution to map the energy transfer dynamics and electronic structure of the Cars. We found that one Car, lutein 2, provides a nexus for light harvesting, collecting energy from higher-lying states and funneling it downhill, partially via a debated dark state observed exclusively on lutein 2. These results show that the protein pocket can tune Car electronic structure via tuning the geometry, a mechanism by which plants control the photophysics of solar energy capture.",

With catalyst loading as low as 0.5 mol\u00a0%, the reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions without the need for additional stoichiometric reagents or generation of waste. Novel chiral ligand L6 plays a critical role in furnishing high catalyst activity, promoting regioselective protonation to produce allenes instead of conjugated enynes, and inducing axial chirality of allenes. The multiple roles of the chiral ligand are rationalized by density functional theory calculations.",

The conversion reaction, which dramatically turns on the 2PA absorption capability of the molecules, can occur in an intracellular environment. Furthermore, Ald-DSB exhibits 40\u00a0times higher efficiency of two-photon generation of singlet oxygen than Ace-DSB.

However, stimuli-responsive chirality transcription with enantiospecific photoreversibility still remains challenging for chiral metallasupramolecular structures because of the lack of appropriate building blocks. Herein, we present a chiral photoresponsive family of diarylethene-containing dipyridyl donors and their coordination-driven self-assembly behavior with the 120\u00b0 di-platinum(II) acceptor. The photochromic trimer units in the assembled metallacycles exhibit an unprecedented concerted photoconversion process without a step-by-step transformation. By taking advantage of the full-separated photoactive dipyridyl donor enantiomers based on the sterically hindered system, we have successfully achieved the phototriggered chirality transformation in supramolecular multi-dithienylethene metallacycles arising from axial helicity and central asymmetry, thereby establishing light-driven control in circular dichroism. Such unique photoreversible self-assembled metallacycles with photoinduced enantiospecificity enable the potential chemical platform for bistable chiroptical switching and non-destructive information encoding.",

By using one of the currently best-performing\u00a0DNA force fields and applying significant computational effort, we described the nature of intermolecular forces that stabilize B-DNA crystals in various symmetry groups and solvent environments with an unprecedented level of detail. We showed a tight coupling between the lattice stability and the type of crystallization additives and that certain symmetry groups are stable only in the presence of a specific additive.

The edge-functionalized g-C3N4 shows a first-order disinfection rate that is five times higher than the previously reported best metal-free photocatalyst but only consumes 1/10 of the catalyst. The catalytic activity is also comparable to that of the best metal-based photocatalyst. Results of the highest occupied molecular orbitals and Mulliken charge distribution reveal that the exposed \u2013COOH and C=O groups at the edges of g-C3N4 nanosheets not only significantly promote charge separation but also induce the upward bending of the surface band, facilitating the generation of hydrogen peroxide.",

In this work, a porous organic polymer with aminopyridine functionalities was designed to fabricate a stable, atomically dispersed Ir catalyst. This Ir-based SAC exhibits excellent catalytic activity during the liquid-phase hydrogenation of CO2 to formate. The associated turnover number is as high as 25,135, representing the best performance yet for a heterogeneous conversion of CO2 to formate. Spectral characterization and density functional theory modeling demonstrate that the chemical structure of the Ir single-atom active site is analogous to that of a homogeneous mononuclear Ir pincer complex catalyst. As a result, a catalytic mechanism similar to that over a homogeneous Ir catalyst occurs during CO2 hydrogenation with this quasi-homogeneous Ir-based SAC.

We reveal a novel diffusion model of charge carriers on surfaces. The nature of charge diffusion varies significantly, from superior diffusion to virtually trapped, depending on the crystal orientation. For instance, carriers on the (110) crystal orientation displayed a diffusion coefficient of \u223c40,000\u00a0cm2\u00b7s\u22121 (i.e., \u223c104 times larger than measured in the bulk). In contrast, the (211) polar facets formed oxidative layers that, in turn, formed mid-surface-trap states that nearly arrested the charge diffusion completely. Complementary techniques and theoretical modeling explain the acute sensitivity of charge carriers to surface orientation and termination.

At the same time, currently unsustainable practices in the production and disposal of plastics continue to deplete our finite natural resources and create severe worldwide environmental consequences. In the search for feasible solutions to these issues, significant recent advances have been made in developing chemically recyclable plastics, which allow for recovery of the building-block chemicals via depolymerization, for repolymerization to virgin-quality plastics, or for creative repurposing into value-added materials. Among such recyclable plastics, polyesters derived from renewable cyclic esters possess real potential to meet these challenges. Hence, this review highlights the plastics derived from common four-, five-, six-, seven-, and eight-membered cyclic esters by covering synthetic strategies, material properties, and, particularly, chemical recyclability. Such studies have culminated a recent discovery of infinitely recyclable plastics with properties of common plastics.",

A possible approach involves strategic input of energy to reaction-specific vibrational levels. Toward this goal, our work describes the coupling of vibrational motions in a terpyridine-molybdenum complex hosting a nonreactive substrate\u2014dinitrogen. Ultrafast coherence spectroscopies revealed a Fermi-resonance coupling mechanism connecting in-plane breathing motion of the light-harvesting terpyridines with the stretching motion of the spatially disparate dinitrogen bridge.

This dynamic disorder localizes charge carriers and enhances electron-phonon coupling, which both quenches photoluminescence and promotes large-polaron formation.

     "abstract": "With the depletion of crude oil and especially the growing demand for lower olefins, the direct conversion of syngas into lower olefins via the Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO) process is a promising alternative for the petroleum route. A photo-driven FTO process can dramatically change the product selectivity over Fe5C2 catalyst, leading to an olefin/paraffin ratio of 10.9 with CO conversion >49%. The selectivity toward CO2 was as low as 18.9%, ensuring a high carbon resource utilization efficiency, and the catalyst showed good stability. Under the photo-irradiation condition, the surface of the Fe5C2 catalyst was spontaneously decorated by O atoms formed in situ, resulting in a high selectivity to olefins, which makes it an excellent catalyst for photo-driven FTO reaction.",

     "abstract": "Controllable droplet motion has attracted extensive attention but still faces the challenges of an uncontrollable sliding speed and a slow response rate. Here, controllable sliding speed and critical sliding angle (CSA) of a droplet on an oil-swollen organogel surface are achieved with a fast response rate via modulation of the DNA chain length. Comprehensive investigations ranging from macroscopic wetting behavior to molecular mechanism suggest that short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) could act as a hydrotrope to interact with oil molecules via interfacial hydrophobic interactions while increasing the interfacial thickness and adhesion, thus hindering the movement of droplets. Conversely, long ssDNA generated from rolling-circle amplification tend toward a curled conformation, minimizing nucleobase exposure and leading to weak interfacial adhesion, allowing the droplets to slide easily. With a significant CSA gradient, biosensing applications for ATP, microRNA, and thrombin detection are demonstrated, indicating the potential for the detection of a broad range of targets.",

This review examines the most recent development in force-sensitive molecules known as mechanophores by re-categorizing them by material phase and method of activation and discussing the forces involved in such flow systems and where activation may occur in relevant manufacturing processes. The overall finding of this review is that for real, practical, and scalable industrial applications of these exciting mechanochemical materials, there must be a concurrent study of the forces experienced and their effect on the detailed chemistry.",

However, one significant challenge has been recognized as the instability for most homogeneous LP catalysts upon recycling, thus inevitably leading to dramatic loss in catalytic activity. Additionally, current heterogeneous LP catalysts suffer from low surface area, which largely limits their catalytic efficiency, thereby restricting their potential applications. In this work, we report the successful introduction of LPs, classical and frustrated, into a metal-organic framework (MOF) that features high surface and ordered pore structure via a stepwise anchoring strategy. Not only can the LP be stabilized by the strong coordination interaction between the LP and MOF, but the resultant MOF-LP also demonstrates excellent catalysis performance with interesting size and steric selectivity. Given the broad applicability of LPs, our work therefore paves a way for advancing MOF-LP as a new paradigm for catalysis.",

Here, combined ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, polarization-resolved femtosecond infrared pump-probe spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal that the hydrophobic interaction between TMAO and urea is favorable in comparison with the hydrogen-bonding interaction. The association of the hydrophobic methyl group of TMAO with urea is driven by the large mismatch between the strong TMAO-water hydrogen bond and the weak urea-water hydrogen bond.

Experimental and theoretical results revealed that the RuPC can not only expand the formation of Li2O2 in electrolyte but also suppress the reactivity of LiO2 intermediate during discharge, thus alleviating the cathode passivation and parasitic reactions significantly. In addition, an initial delithiation pathway can be achieved when charging in turn; thus, the Li2O2 products can be decomposed reversibly with a low overpotential. Consequently, the RuPC-catalyzed Li-O2 batteries exhibited a high discharge capacity, a low charge overpotential, and an ultralong cycle life.

Experiments show that polycation-wrapped particles disrupt the tails of zwitterionic lipids, increase bilayer fluidity, and leave the membrane with reduced \u03b6 potentials.

Herein, we reveal that a low electron-injection rate at the ETL-free interface is responsible for the performance loss. Moreover, we demonstrate that improving carrier lifetimes in the perovskite films can remedy the poor carrier extraction at interfaces, enabling carrier collection efficiency in ETL-free photovoltaics to approach that in ETL-containing devices. Using perovskite films with microsecond carrier lifetimes, we obtained ETL-free devices with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.5%, nearly eliminated hysteresis, and good stability. Such a PCE value is comparable to that (20.7%) of the analogous ETL-containing photovoltaics. These results offer opportunities for ETL-free architecture designs in the perovskite photovoltaics family. More importantly, this research provides a general approach to improving the performance of photovoltaics with low-injection-rate interfaces.",

We demonstrate that not only does Al2O3 coat the LMO, but the Al heteroatom of the trimethylaluminum (TMA) precursor also dopes to interstitial sites on the LMO surface, thereby reducing the oxidation state of near-surface Mn ions. DFT calculations further suggest facile transfer of methyl groups from the TMA precursor to oxygen atoms on the LMO surface, which blocks adsorption sites for subsequent TMA adsorption. These predictions are supported by quartz crystal microbalance experiments demonstrating inhibited growth below ten ALD Al2O3 cycles, suggesting that sub-monolayer coverages of alumina are present on the LMO surface in the early stages of film growth. In comparison with fully conformal films, these sub-monolayer coatings show enhanced electrochemical capacity when cycled in coin cells.",

We discover that the similarity between the molecular structure of CPK and the repeating unit of PVP makes the competitive adsorption between them accessible, and the different desorption rates of PVP and CPK result in different crystal growth inhibition effects (strong for PVP and weak for CPK). Thus, the competitive adsorption between PVP and CPK leads to the precise modulation of the growth of these nanowires, which can be further illustrated by density functional theory. This work presents new opportunities to modulate the synthesis of nanocrystals by competitive adsorption between polymer ligands and their monomeric analogs.",

In this review, we discuss recent progress in promoting electrocatalysis for renewable energy technologies based on surface or interface engineering with special emphasis on the geometric structures. We first introduce the state-of-the-art engineering methods for achieving the desired surface or interface and correlate these structures with their catalytic performances. Then, we describe classic examples of rational surfaces and interfaces for tuning metallic nanomaterials for several key catalytic reactions in renewable energy technologies, including the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions, oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, methanol oxidation reaction, and electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. Finally, we provide personal perspectives to highlight the challenges and opportunities for metallic electrocatalysts in terms of catalysis-driven surface and interface engineering.",

Combining in operando time-of-flight mass spectrometry, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and density functional theory calculations, we found that methane conversion proceeds on the O\u2013FeN4\u2013O active site along a radical pathway to produce CH3OH and CH3OOH first, and then the generated CH3OH can be further catalyzed to form HOCH2OOH and HCOOH at room temperature.",

Wound closure of leaves is one example. If polymers can be formed in a similar manner by introducing multiphase-separated morphologies, self-healing in a variety of commodity materials can be achieved. In these studies, we demonstrate the role of phase morphologies, interphases, and viscoelasticity-driven shape memory effects on self-healing. We synthesized phase-separated polycaprolactone-polyurethane fibrous thermoplastic polymers in which microphase separation facilitates the formation of stable interfacial regions between hard and soft segments. Self-healing can be repeated many times. This behavior is attributed to the shape memory effect, given that micron-scale interphase reduces chain slippage, enabling entropic energy storage during damage. Chemically identical but nanophase-separated copolymers do not exhibit this behavior. These studies show that self-healing can be achieved by morphology control and facilitated by thermal or other volume-induced transitions.",

The role of spiroindolenine, the generally proposed key intermediate in\u00a0catalytic asymmetric Pictet-Spengler reactions, remains elusive. Herein, combined density functional theory calculations and direct molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the role of this intermediate is divergent. The spiroindolenine acts as either a productive or a non-productive intermediate depending on the shape of the potential energy surface. In the former case, dynamic effects play an important role in the rearrangement of spiroindolenine, which can occur without passing through the intervening transition states along the reaction coordinates. In the latter case, the formation of spiroindolenine is only an off-cycle\u00a0equilibrium. These theoretical predictions were verified experimentally. Furthermore, these insights were applied to seven reported catalytic asymmetric Pictet-Spengler reactions, leading to unified mechanistic understandings of this synthetically enabling reaction.",

Specifically, CO conversion efficiency was raised from 13% to 53% at\u00a0\u22120.70\u00a0V and from 43% to 80% at \u22120.85\u00a0V (versus a reversible hydrogen electrode) in comparison with that of a bare silver electrode. The porosity of COFs favored molecular diffusion to the electrode surface, and the amine functional groups close to the electrode surface promoted CO2 conversion efficiency by forming carbamate intermediates.",

Herein, we contribute an effective strategy for imparting superwettability on COFs by chemically coating the pore surface with perfluoroalkyl groups to confer them with superhydrophobicity. Taking advantage of controllable modification, the resultant COFs retain the porosity and crystallinity of the pristine COFs. Benefiting from the bulk superhydrophobicity of the COF crystals and the feasibility of COF synthesis, they can be used as a coat or in situ integrated within various substrates; once applied, this renders them superhydrophobic. Given the modular nature, this protocol is compatible with the development of various specific wettabilities in COFs, which thereby constitutes a step for expanding the scope of COF applications and provides many opportunities for the processing of advanced materials and devices.",

This hole-catalyzed pathway is accessible to all azobenzenes, without exception, and offers tremendous advantages over the recently reported reductive, radical-anionic pathway because it allows for convenient chemical initiation without the need for electrochemical setups and in the presence of air. In addition, catalytic amounts of metal-free sensitizers, such as methylene blue, can be used as excited-state electron acceptors, enabling a shift of the excitation wavelength to the far red of the azobenzene absorption (up to 660\u00a0nm) and providing quantum yields exceeding unity (up to 200%).

The challenge is rooted in the lack of control over nucleophilic substitution with carbon nucleophiles at silicon atoms with three or four leaving groups. For example, SiCl4 usually converts into intractable mixtures of chlorosilanes, typically requiring several distillation cycles to reach high purity. Accordingly, there is no universal approach to silanes with heteroleptic substitution. Here, using a bench-stable SiH4 surrogate, we introduce a general strategy for the on-demand synthesis of silicon compounds decorated with different aryl and alkyl substituents. Reliable protocols are the basis of the selective and programmable synthesis of dihydro- and monohydrosilanes; aryl-substituted trihydrosilanes are also accessible in a straightforward fashion.

Construction of the DMAP cytokines and growth factors relies on non-covalent coordination chemistry between an oligo-histidine tag and dimeric Ni(II)-nitrilotriacetate in an in situ manner. This supramolecular approach is relatively simple and flexible and can be applied to labeling not only transiently but also endogenously expressed receptors.

Here, we demonstrate engineering of layered MOFs and access to photochromic MONs. The strategy entails the use of programmed photochromic organic linkers characterized by a bulged core and metal-mediated self-assembly that occurs only in two dimensions, leading to layered MOFs. MONs exfoliated from such MOFs exhibit brilliant photochromism perceptible to the naked eye. We show that the MONs can be entrapped in an ormosil matrix for the development of polymer composites that display uncomplicated thermal bleaching kinetics.

In the hydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-propyne, the thiol-treated Pd nanosheets exhibited excellent catalytic selectivity (>97%) toward the semihydrogenation product (1-phenyl-1-propene). The catalyst was highly stable and showed no obvious decay in either activity or selectivity for over ten cycles. Systematic studies demonstrated that a unique Pd-sulfide/thiolate interface created by the thiol treatment was crucial to the semihydrogenation. The high catalytic selectivity and activity benefited from the combined steric and electronic effects that inhibited the deeper hydrogenation of C=C bonds. More importantly, this thiol treatment strategy is applicable to creating highly active and selective practical catalysts from commercial Pd/C catalysts for semihydrogenation of internal alkynes.",

Next to observing the key intermediates in solution-based SF, including the formation and decay of a quintet state that precedes formation of the pentacene triplet excitons, we demonstrate that the coupling is sufficiently weak that SF is essentially inoperative in non-polar media. Transitioning to a polar medium, however, amplifies the coupling strength such that SF becomes operative and supports long triplet lifetimes. Our results offer strong evidence for a charge-transfer mediation and, in turn, provide a solid framework for decoding the complete mechanism of SF in systems beyond pentacene.",

Electron transfer follows within less than 100 fs, whereas energy relaxation requires 200 fs. Surface plasmons couple to low-frequency phonons of gold, and free charges also couple to higher-frequency phonons of gold and MoS2. The contribution of the charge-transfer photoexcitation mechanism to plasmon-driven charge separation depends strongly on the type of donor-acceptor interaction, e.g., chemical versus van der Waals, and more weakly on contact area and system geometry.

     "abstract": "High-capacity and high-power nickel-based cathode materials have become the principal candidates for a lithium-ion energy storage system powering electrified transportation units. With high nickel content, the cathodes are of great interest for delivering the desired specific energy and energy density. However, the cells still suffer from fast capacity decay and low thermal-abuse tolerance to high voltage. At the highly delithiated state, the damage in the cell is mainly from severe parasitic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction in the cathode and oxidization of the organic electrolyte. These side reactions rapidly weaken the system's rate capacity and cyclability. Solutions are being sought to provide safe operation and practical application. Three strategies have proven to be encouraging choices: surface coating, a core-shell structure, and a concentration gradient structure. For each strategy, the material architecture, fabrication procedure, operation principle, advances, and challenges are discussed in this review. The prospects for further developments are also summarized.",

On the basis of the structure of a fluorescent A\u03b2 probe, CRANAD-2, a bromine atom was introduced to increase the production of singlet oxygen for photooxygenation. The use of julolidine and perfluoroalkylborate moieties as electron-donor and -acceptor components, respectively, markedly enhanced the photocatalytic activity and reduced phototoxicity. Photooxygenation of aggregated A\u03b2 by 9 under NIR irradiation in the presence of cells attenuated the cytotoxicity of A\u03b2.

     "abstract": "Here, we demonstrate that wood can be directly converted into a highly compressible wood carbon sponge (WCS) by lignin and hemicellulose removal followed by carbonization. The significant removal of lignin and hemicellulose via chemical treatment destroys the thin cell walls of natural wood, giving rise to a lamellar structure with numerous stacked arched layers. The lamellar structure can be well preserved even after high-temperature carbonization. Interestingly, such a lamellar structure renders a high compressibility up to 80% and high fatigue resistance of 10,000 compression cycles at 50% strain. Further experimental and modeling studies reveal that WCS can accommodate substantial compression from the bending and flattening of the curved layers, resulting in minimum stretching of individual layers. The WCS also demonstrates a sensitive electrical conductivity change upon compression. Using this lamellar sponged structure and the excellent mechanical and electrical properties of WCS as an example, we demonstrate the great potential of WCS for highly sensitive strain sensors.",

Through theoretical investigations and molecular engineering of strain-loadable cycloalkenes, we demonstrate the rapid chemoselective cycloaddition of alkyl azides with unstrained cycloalkenes via the transiently (reversibly) formed trans-cycloalkene. We assess this system via the rapid bioconjugation of azide-functionalized insulin. An attractive feature of this process is the cleavable nature of the linker, which makes a catch-and-release strategy possible.

The first approach simultaneously monitors each exciton's energy fluctuations over time to obtain its time-dependent electronic-nuclear interactions. The second method isolates evidence of coupled interexcitonic environmental motions. The techniques are validated with Nile Blue A and subsequently used on the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. The FMO data reveal that each exciton experiences nearly identical spectral motion after excitation and that spectral motion of one excited exciton induces similar motion on unpopulated neighboring excitonic states. These synchronized and correlated spectral dynamics prolong coherences in the FMO complex after femtosecond excitation.",

Yolk-shelled Zn-based zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF-8) RDCs are first synthesized by chemical etching of ZIF-8 rhombic dodecahedrons.

The composition of the multi-shelled ZnS-CdS RDCs can be tuned by varying the cation-exchange reaction time, and the shell number can be adjusted by changing the size of ZIF-8 precursors.

     "abstract": "Essential to elucidating fundamental biological processes is first gaining precise and reversible external control over proteins without altering their natural structure. To achieve this goal, we developed an aptamer-based, noninvasive, photoresponsive nanoplatform capable of reversible and quantitative regulation of target protein activity. Protein-specific aptamers equipped with several light-responsive molecules were functionalized onto the surfaces of nanoparticles. Adjusting light irradiation allowed the light-responsive molecules to drive the conformational switch of aptamer between the blocked status and liberated status. In this way, the target proteins were captured around the nanoparticle or released into the medium, thus leading to inhibition or activation of the protein, respectively. Moreover, modulating light irradiation allowed quantitative control of protein activity.",

     "abstract": "Redox flow batteries have great system scalability and operational flexibility but relatively low energy density because of the limited solubility of redox molecules in the electrolytes. By storing energy in solid materials while producing power from redox fluids, the redox-targeting concept provides an effective way to significantly increase the energy density of flow batteries. Redox targeting generally involves multiple redox reactions between the molecules and materials, which inevitably brings about additional complexity in electrolyte composition and low voltage efficiency. The Nernstian-potential-driven redox-targeting reaction reported here considerably eliminates the voltage loss of a LiFePO4-based redox flow lithium battery. Driven by the Nernstian potential difference, the redox molecule, a ferrocene-grafted ionic liquid with standard potential identical to that of LiFePO4, reacts with the solid material both anodically and cathodically and exhibits near-unity material utilization, a voltage efficiency of 95%, and an energy density of 330 Wh/L (up to 942 Wh/L).",

To circumvent pulverization-induced capacity decay, self-healing chemistry between binder and active material is critical but is never reported. Here, we report a self-healing electrode with hydrogen bonding between an oxygen-rich active material, sodium rhodizonate dibasic (SRD), and a hydroxyl-rich binder, sodium alginate (SA). During the sodiation of microsized SRD, cracks induced by volume expansion expose a new oxygen-rich surface, whereas the SA binder fills these cracks under pressure generated by volume expansion and binds the pulverized SRD together by hydrogen bonding between SRD and SA. Self-healing between hydroxyl-rich binder and oxygen-rich active material is a universal strategy for mitigating the pulverization-induced capacity decay of active materials, as demonstrated by the longer cycle life of the SRD electrode with other hydroxyl-rich binders, polyacrylic acid, and xanthan gum than with hydroxyl-free polytetrafluoroethylene binder.",

The assembly of monomers into supramolecular architectures via non-covalent interactions is chiefly directed by the molecular structures, their functional groups, and environmental conditions. The principal advantage of non-covalent interactions is reversibility, which allows the assembly of monomers into supramolecular structures in situ depending on the local conditions. In addition, the supramolecular approach provides a degree of control over self-assembly at the molecular level, thereby influencing the macroscopic level and facilitating tuning of the bulk material properties. This review discusses the meritorious examples of supramolecular materials constructed through the molecular assembly process, guided by the classical principles of supramolecular chemistry.

However, current regulation strategies inevitably involve ambiguous entanglement of crystals, electrons, and spin degrees of freedom. Here, we developed a spin-state regulation method to optimize oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity by lattice orientation control of LaCoO3 epitaxial films. The different lattice-oriented LaCoO3 films bring different degrees of distortion of the CoO6 octahedron, successfully inducing a spin-state transition of cobalt from a low spin state (LS\u00a0t2g6eg0) to an intermediate spin state (IS t2g5eg1). X-ray absorption spectroscopy of Co L-edge and O K-edge provides experimental support of spin-state transition in different lattice-oriented LaCoO3 films. As expected, LaCoO3 (100) film possesses optimal eg electron filling, lower adsorption free energy, and higher conductivity, exhibiting better OER performance than the other two films. Our findings demonstrate that electronic state regulation will be a new avenue for the rational design of high-activity perovskite electrocatalysts.",

Here, we report a strategy that allows for the site-selective and site-divergent delivery of terminal propargyls to various monosaccharides, the basic units of carbohydrates. This strategy is based on synergistic catalysis that combines copper and borinic acid catalysis. With a pair of antipodal ligands, this method can be tuned to propargylate either the equatorial or the axial hydroxyl with high selectivities. The generality of this transformation is manifest in the direct propargylation of complex, unprotected glycosylated natural products.

Also, fast reaction kinetics bring an imbalance in the desirable properties of rGO.

The fabricated all-solid-state supercapacitors of as-synthesized rGO exhibited significantly higher specific capacitance than those obtained with rGO derived from conventional reducing agents. The cycling stability of the all-solid-state supercapacitor (>80% retention of capacitance beyond 100,000 continued cycles) and its flexibility (>500 bending cycles) were remarkable. Use of commercially available organic electrolyte further boosted the supercapacitor performance.",

Here, as an unconventional approach, time-resolved IR (TRIR) spectroscopy on aromatic and anti-aromatic hexaphyrin congeners shed light on excited-singlet-state aromaticity. The contrasting spectral features between the Fourier transform IR and TRIR spectra reveal the aromaticity-driven structural changes, corroborating aromaticity reversal in the excited singlet states. Our paradigm for excited-state aromaticity, the correlation of IR spectral features with aromaticity reversal, provides another fundamental key to understanding the role of (anti)aromaticity in the stability, dynamics, and reactivity in the excited singlet state of \u03c0-conjugated molecular systems.",

We found that the changes in hydration free energy upon fluorination depended strongly on amino acid identity and the location of the fluorinated site. We present a phenomenological model that quantitatively predicts the simulation results. The model demonstrates that changes in hydrophobicity upon fluorination largely arise from steric hindrance of backbone-water hydrogen bonds by \u2013CF3; changes in surface area, often invoked to explain experimental trends, have only a secondary contribution.

     "abstract": "Lamellar supramolecular assemblies are a common feature of fibrous gels formed by molecules such as peptides and ureas. Competition between gelation and crystallization is highly solvent dependent and can be governed by the dynamics of nascent lamellae in solution. We hypothesize that gel fibrils are formed when the scrolling of lamellae outpaces multilayer stacking. Crystallographic data on model picolyl bis(urea)s were correlated with their gelation properties. Most structures are lamellar, and gels involving fibrous aggregates form concomitantly alongside crystalline solvates. A distinguishing feature of\u00a0these solvate crystals is that the lamellae have unequal numbers of picolyl groups on opposite faces. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations show that this asymmetry causes isolated lamellae to scroll spontaneously into fibrils, whereas symmetrical lamellae adopt flat, crumpled, or saddle-like morphologies. Scrolling represents a general mechanism for gel formation, affording networks of unbranched fibers with monodisperse diameters dictated by the equilibrium curvature of the folding lamellae.",

The endocyclic heteroatoms of cyclodecynes provide dual electronic activation via hyperconjugative (direct) and conjugative (remote) effects. These\u00a0effects are weakened by the geometric constraints imposed by the twisted backbone, but structural reorganization in the transition state (TS) removes these constraints and unlocks the power of remote electronic effects for selective TS stabilization. Gram-scale synthesis and purification by recrystallization make this an efficient and practical approach to enantiopure cycloalkynes. Experimental kinetics confirm that these twisted cyclodecynes can be more reactive toward azides than activated cyclononynes and approach the reactivity of cyclooctynes. Furthermore, cycloalkynes with a twisted polyaromatic backbone can potentially add axial chirality to the \u201cclick\u201d chemistry toolbox.",

Cucurbit[7]uril derivatives that can selectively detect ATS have been synthesized and used as a functional material. The fabricated amperometric sensors exhibited unprecedented sensitivity toward ATS, with a detection limit of nanomolar concentrations in urine and picomolar concentrations in water or a physiologic buffer. The feasibility of this strategy was further demonstrated through the preparation of flexible and wearable devices with a wireless sensing platform. This sensing system offers rapid and sensitive detection of trace amounts of ATS in urine and other samples at the point of use.",

However, the limited understanding of solvent effects in ion recognition leads to a persistent blind spot that prevents effective receptor design. We experimentally discovered an underlying 1/\u025br dependence of anion affinity on solvent dielectric constant (\u025br). We found this relationship by measuring how chloride binds to\u00a0macrocyclic triazolophane receptors across a wide range of solvents: \u025br\u00a0= 4.7\u201356.2. Solvent weakens affinity by screening electrostatics; electrostatics dominates when \u025br\u00a0< 4.7 (chloroform) and then transits a cross-over region (4.7\u00a0< \u025br\u00a0< 20.5; acetone), after which it no longer governs affinity (acetonitrile and DMSO). Density functional theory helped us understand this dependence. Our theory-backed model accurately predicts Cl\u2013 affinity in solvents used in liquid-liquid extractions in the nuclear fuel cycle. This model offers a general foundation for anion recognition and electrostatically driven complexation.",

The Lewis base urea is found to interact with solution precursors to retard crystal growth and enhance crystallinity, which subsequently precipitates at grain boundaries to passivate defects after completion of crystal growth. The resulting perovskite films show superior homogeneity in conductivity at both grain interior and boundaries in comparison with the bare perovskite films.",

C12+ heavy hydrocarbons almost disappeared, and the catalyst showed good stability.

We further describe how the nature and plasticity of these interactions modulate nanoparticle-based chemosensing. Importantly, we found that self-organization of coating thiols can induce the formation of binding pockets in AuNPs. These transient cavities can accommodate small molecules, mimicking protein-ligand recognition, which could explain the selectivity and sensitivity observed for different organic analytes in NMR chemosensing experiments.

We have developed an artificial catalyst system composed of nucleosome-binding catalysts and acyl donors, which preferentially acetylated or malonylated lysines on histone tails and suppressed intra- and inter-nucleosome interactions similarly to HATs. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by identifying a site-selectivity difference between two HDAC isoforms, Sirt1 and Sirt6, and comparing the functions of histone malonylation and\u00a0acetylation.

     "abstract": "Heteroarene methylation utilizing a cheap and safe methylation source without involving transition metals represents an important yet challenging objective. Here, a simple and clean catalyst-free protocol for the methylation of various heteroarenes (including six- and five-membered types) is described under light irradiation. This protocol employs cheap, readily available, and abundant MeOH as both the solvent and the methylation source. It was found that adding dichloromethane (DCM) as a co-solvent could significantly increase the yield of the methylation products. Heteroarenes bearing various functional groups could be methylated and tri-deuteromethylated successfully. Deuterium labeling studies suggested that the newly generated methyl group in the products consisted of two hydrogens from the methyl group and one hydrogen from the OH group in MeOH.",

PBIs can self-assemble into a range of structures, but it is rare to be able to control the packing such that the same PBI can form either H-type or J-type aggregates. This is important because the conductivity pathways and optoelectronic properties are directly affected by this packing. Here, we show that we can control the packing of a single PBI functionalized with an amino acid by a subtle change in pH. Under one set of conditions, H-type aggregates form a gel when the pH is decreased. At a slightly different set of starting conditions, J-type aggregates are formed, but they cannot form a gel when the pH is lowered. We show that films formed from the self-assembled structures have very different photoconductive properties.",

If prebiotic chemistry is prone to produce highly complex mixtures that do not reflect life's underlying unity, this then implies that the feasibility of elucidating life's origins might be an insurmountable task. However, recently, prebiotic systems chemistry has emerged to exploit the chemical links between different metabolites, providing unprecedented scope for exploration of the origins of life and an exciting new perspective on a four-billion-year-old problem. At the heart of this systems approach is an understanding that individual classes of metabolites cannot be considered in isolation, and this review highlights some recent advances that suggest that canonical metabolites are predisposed chemical structures.",

Although many attempts have been made to achieve dehydrogenative C\u2013H amination, the low reactivity of simple arenes renders equimolar coupling with amine derivatives a formidable task in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report equimolar C\u2013H/N\u2013H coupling of arenes and sulfonimides through dehydrogenative aromatic imidation. This was accomplished by means of a ruthenium-based photoredox mediator that employed the arene as the limiting reagent. A wide range of arenes, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heteroarenes, as well as a variety of sulfonimides, were applicable to the reaction. This electrochemistry-based mechanistic study has uncovered that the coupling reaction is initiated by the oxidation of sulfonimides by the ruthenium catalyst.",

Despite efforts to create a single pore in a lipid bilayer by synthetic channels, a general synthetic strategy for realizing more complex two-pore channels has yet to be proposed. Here, we demonstrate two distinct ion conductance states by embedding a single metal-organic porous molecule with the geometry of an Archimedean cuboctahedron into an artificially reconstructed lipid bilayer membrane in which triangular and square apertures in the cuboctahedron work independently as ion-transporting pathways. By changing the aliphatic chain length introduced on the periphery of the cuboctahedron, we found that the rotational dynamics of the cuboctahedron regulate the open pore time of each conductance state through distinct apertures and the switching between them.",

Microphase separation results from the system, minimizing repulsive interactions between dissimilar blocks and maximizing attractive interactions between similar blocks. Supramolecular methods have also achieved this separation by introducing small-molecule additives binding specifically to one block by noncovalent interactions. Here, we use halogen bonding as a supramolecular tool that directs the hierarchical self-assembly of low-molecular-weight perfluorinated molecules and diblock copolymers. Microphase separation results in a lamellar-within-cylindrical arrangement and promotes upright cylindrical alignment in films upon rapid casting and without further annealing. Such cylindrical domains with internal lamellar self-assemblies can be cleaved by solvent treatment of bulk films, resulting in separated and segmented cylindrical micelles stabilized by halogen-bond-based supramolecular crosslinks. These features, alongside the reversible nature of halogen bonding, provide a robust modular approach for nanofabrication.",

     "abstract": "Relying solely on mild UV irradiation of thiocarbonylthio compounds in the presence of vinyl monomers, a new avenue to well-defined ultra-high-molecular-weight (UHMW) polymers has been developed. Through the use of aqueous conditions, well-controlled UHMW polymers that are unprecedented for controlled radical polymerizations have been achieved. This photomediated polymerization approach reaches number-average molecular weights in excess of 8.00\u00a0\u00d7 106 g/mol with degrees of polymerization above 85,000, making these, to our knowledge, the highest-molecular-weight polymers ever achieved via reversible-deactivation radical polymerization. In many cases, well-defined UHMW polymers can be obtained in minutes. The utility of the technique is further demonstrated through the synthesis of block copolymers, enabling access to a new field of well-defined UHMW materials.",

The active cis conformation of CA-4 can readily isomerize into a thermodynamically more stable but significantly less active trans form. Here, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of cis-CA-4 in complex with tubulin. The compound binds to the colchicine site of tubulin and displays both common and distinct interaction points with colchicine. Using metadynamics simulations, we generated the trans form of the ligand within its binding site and computed the relative binding free energy of the cis-CA-4 and trans-CA-4 isomers via a thermodynamic cycle. The calculations suggest structural distortions of the bound trans-CA-4 molecule as the likely cause of its reduced activity in comparison with that of its cis isomer. Our findings could open up unique possibilities for structure-guided drug engineering with the aim of discovering combretastatin variants with improved chemical properties and pharmacological profiles.",

To facilitate structure-activity studies with these glycans, we established a universal strategy to synthesize linear and branched LacNAc as well as differentially sulfated KS oligosaccharides by automated glycan assembly. We synthesized oligosaccharides as long as hexamers by combining four monosaccharide building blocks. Key to the strategy was installing three orthogonal protection groups, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), levulinoyl (Lev) ester, and 2-naphthylmethyl (Nap) ether, which were selectively removed from a common oligosaccharide precursor for differential sulfation. Microarrays presenting the synthetic oligosaccharides revealed a specific interaction between a disulfated KS tetrasaccharide and the adeno-associated virus AAVrh10 gene-therapy vector, which was further corroborated by surface plasmon resonance studies. Thus, KS represents a novel receptor candidate for AAVrh10. These insights could have implications for cell-type-specific gene-delivery approaches.",

Using a reversible hydrogen-bond protection strategy, we were able to fully characterize this insoluble polymer in solution and process it into smooth thin films. In the solid state, the material demonstrated excellent resistance to organic solvents, aqueous acids, and thermal treatments, rendering a solution-processed, solvent-resistant thin film. This unique property allows for solution manipulation of robust polymer materials for applications associated with extreme operating or processing conditions. This scalable fused-ring polymer also demonstrated promising potential as a precursor for graphitic carbon materials.",

We demonstrate that negative gas adsorption originates from molecular buckling of the organic structural unit and thus allows a colossal framework transformation.

The molecular insight presented here unveils the mechanics and thermodynamics responsible for negative gas adsorption and provides unparalleled understanding to aid the discovery of new examples of similarly responsive porous metamaterials.",

Herein, we elucidate a cluster-isolation process that yields an unligated Zn2+-Al3+-Cr3+ polyoxocation. For decades, Cr3+-polyoxocations have proved elusive synthetic targets because of hydrolytic instability. We overcame the synthetic challenges by the following strategies: (1) pH-driven hydrolysis by oxidative dissolution of zinc; (2) metal nitrate concentrations 10\u00d7 higher than conventional syntheses, suppressing cluster assembly; and (3) azeotropic evaporation of HNO3-H2O, driving cluster assembly and crystallization at the solution surface. Contrary to common cluster growth, the fully assembled cluster is never detected in\u00a0the reaction solution. Because these reactive clusters do not persist in solution, uncontrolled precipitation of metal hydroxide is avoided. The proposed formation pathway opens opportunities to expand the composition space of metal-oxo clusters.",

The supramolecular assemblies have been structurally characterized and involve two {Cr7Ni} rings bound to {Ru2M} triangles through iso-nicotinate ligands. Detailed physical studies, including electrochemistry and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, show that when M\u00a0= Co, the supramolecular assembly has the physical characteristics needed to implement the \u221aiSWAP gate, which is an important entangling two-qubit gate. Detailed simulations show that the fidelity of this gate is potentially very high and depends on the phase memory time of the {Cr7Ni} qubits but not the {Ru2Co} switch.",

However, that C2H2 and CO2 exhibit similar size and physicochemical properties makes their separation by physisorption extremely difficult. In this work, we detail how two hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs)\u2014known variant SIFSIX-3-Ni and variant TIFSIX-2-Cu-i\u2014exhibit exceptional CO2/C2H2 and C2H2/CO2 selectivity, respectively. SIFSIX-3-Ni sets a benchmark for CO2/C2H2 selectivity at low partial pressures, whereas TIFSIX-2-Cu-i ranks among the best porous materials in the context of C2H2/CO2 selectivity. The performance of these HUMs was confirmed by real-time dynamic breakthrough experiments. To our knowledge, such yin-yang inversion of selectivity in closely related compounds is unprecedented. We attribute this to the distinct sorbate binding sites in SIFSIX-3-Ni and TIFSIX-2-Cu-i, as revealed by modeling studies.",

Under pre-illumination treatment, the decay times are reduced by orders of magnitude, but if left to rest for sufficient time, the solar cell evolves to its original decay kinetics. In order to explain these observations, we developed advanced modeling of the perovskite solar cell to obtain a realistic description of the immediate vicinity of the interface, including ionic variable concentration and accumulation of holes via degenerate statistics in the space charge region. The results reveal a large amount of majority carriers at the minority carrier extraction contact, assisted by additional ionic charge. The surface band bending related to accumulation gives an electrostatic contribution to the photovoltage in a manner governed by slow dynamics of cations at the electron-selective contact. The modeling of the interface allows us to describe the dynamics of the contact region dominated by surface charging and recombination. These phenomena also play an\u00a0important role in operation conditions and current-voltage scans of the solar\u00a0cell.",

Here, we report a systematic study on the electrochemical characteristics of quinones for organic flow batteries with a combined experimental and computational method. The redox properties of quinones were found to be strongly dependent on the molecular aromaticity and their electronic structures.

Furthermore, it is very difficult to reach the DOE targets for volumetric (350\u00a0cm3 [STP] cm\u22123) and gravimetric (0.5\u00a0g [CH4]/g) storage capacities simultaneously for a single MOF. This review systematically evaluates and compares the methane storage capacities of reported MOFs at both 298 and 270 K. We found that slightly reducing the storage temperature to 270 K can significantly improve both the volumetric and gravimetric uptake. Our discoveries highlight that two unique MOFs, NU-111 and MOF-177 (which have high pore volumes of 2.09 and 1.89\u00a0cm3 g\u22121, respectively), not only have very high gravimetric capacities of 0.5 and 0.43 g/g, respectively, but also exhibit the highest working capacities ever reported: 239 and 230\u00a0cm3 (STP) cm\u22123, respectively. In addition, a usable empirical equation for predicting methane storage capacities (at 270 K and 65 bar) and some engineering strategies for thermal management are discussed.",

Comprehensive investigations on the molecular orbitals revealed that an excited state with hybrid (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) configurations in appreciable proportion is desired. Tailoring the aromatic subunits in arylphenones can effectively tune the energy level and the orbital feature of the triplet exciton. Our experimental data reveal that a series of full-color pure organic phosphors with a balanced lifetime (up to 0.23 s) and efficiency (up to 36.0%) can be realized under ambient conditions, demonstrating the validity of our instructive design principle.",

Through a combination of photoelectrochemical and high-resolution electron microscope measurements, we found that the self-limiting surface oxidation of Ta3N5 resulted in a thin amorphous layer (ca. 3\u00a0nm), which proved to be effective in pinning the surface Fermi levels and thus fully suppressed the photoactivity of Ta3N5. X-ray core-level spectroscopy characterization not only confirmed the surface composition change resulting from the oxidation but also revealed a Fermi-level shift toward the positive direction by up to 0.5 V.

     "abstract": "Our future global sustainability mandates fundamental innovations in sciences and technologies with regard to resources, energy, and the environment. The exploration of unconventional chemical reactivities that can directly transform readily available feedstocks (preferably renewable ones) without the need for extensive manipulation could have a positive impact on the three key interconnected pillars of sustainability: resources, energy, and the environment (waste minimization). As part of this endeavor, this review explores new fundamental reactions that can drastically shorten synthetic steps, more directly transform renewable biomass and abundant feedstocks (e.g., CO2 and methane) into high-value products, harvest solar energy by chemical means, and utilize light as energy input for chemical conversions. These new reactivities could potentially provide some food for thought for the next generation of fundamental molecular transformations with an eye on future sustainability.",

     "abstract": "An accumulation of fatigue-induced microdamage can often result in an overall thinning and weakening of the bone\u2019s structure through a reduction in its mass, which increases its fragility and makes an individual more susceptible to fractures. Consequently, it is vitally important to detect and quantify microdamage early in order to diagnose skeletal diseases and combat their progression. Herein, we present the synthesis and study of europium [Eu(III)]-emitting surface-modified gold nanoparticles as contrast agents for imaging microdamaged bone structure at low concentrations. These nanostructures can be utilized to generate three-dimensional maps (z stacking) of microcracks formed within bone. Using two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy, we were able to visualize and understand the manner in which these nanoagents bind to damaged bone, as well as demonstrate their selectivity toward exposed Ca(II) within microcracks. Such systems are therefore ideal for biological application as targeted contrast agents for both optical imaging and MRI.",

For the ready transition of direct trifluoromethylation methodologies to large-scale application, the further development of processes utilizing inexpensive CF3 sources available on a metric ton scale is highly desirable. We report the use of pyridine N-oxide derivatives in concert with trifluoroacetic anhydride to promote a high-yielding and scalable trifluoromethylation reaction.

BTAPs were found to be highly porous and showed exceptional physiochemical stability. Moreover, in\u00a0situ chemical impregnation of sulfur within the micropores increased CO2 affinity of the sorbent while limiting diffusion of CH4. As low-cost, scalable solid sorbents, BTAPs showed promising CO2 separation ability and high regenerability under vacuum swing adsorption for the simulated flue gas, natural gas, and landfill gas conditions. The fact that elemental sulfur can be directly utilized in the synthesis of BTAPs means that it can be recycled back to the natural gas sweetening process for efficient CO2/CH4 separation, thus offering a high-value, scalable, large-scale application for elemental sulfur.",

The platform creates a sterile diagnostic device by using 3D printing, and the device is filled automatically with growth medium, and then antibiotics are sprayed onto the medium by ink-jet technology.

Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we studied a soluble polypentacene derivative and well-defined oligomers with 2\u20135 repeat units to elaborate the trend in triplet-pair dynamics with increasing lengths. We found that the SF rate constant increased monotonically with the number of repeat units. However, recombination in all cases was rapid (<1\u00a0ns) and was nearly independent of the number of repeat units. The transient spectra and constant triplet-pair lifetime indicated that correlated triplet pairs were formed on adjacent chromophores and that they did not diffuse apart before recombination.",

Thus, supramolecular biomaterials with tunable properties are well suited for the study of stem cell differentiation. In this report, we exploited this phenomenon by combining stem cell differentiation in hydrogels with variable stiffness and metabolomics analysis to identify specific bioactive lipids that are uniquely used up during differentiation. To achieve this, we cultured perivascular stem cells on supramolecular peptide gels of different stiffness, and metabolite depletion followed. On soft (1\u00a0kPa), stiff (13\u00a0kPa), and rigid (32\u00a0kPa) gels, we observed neuronal, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation, respectively, showing that these stem cells undergo stiffness-directed fate selection. By analyzing concentration variances of >600 metabolites during differentiation on the stiff and rigid gels (and focusing on chondrogenesis and osteogenesis as regenerative targets, respectively), we identified that specific lipids (lysophosphatidic acid and cholesterol sulfate, respectively), were significantly depleted. We propose that these metabolites are therefore involved in the differentiation process. In order to unequivocally demonstrate that the lipid metabolites that we identified play key roles in driving differentiation, we subsequently demonstrated that these individual lipids can, when fed to standard stem cell cultures, induce differentiation toward chondrocyte and osteoblast phenotypes. Our concept exploits the design of supramolecular biomaterials as a strategy for discovering cell-directing bioactive metabolites of therapeutic relevance.",

     "abstract": "Renewable resources and bio-based feedstocks may present a sustainable alternative to petrochemical sources to satisfy modern society's ever-increasing demand for energy and chemicals. However, the conversion processes needed\u00a0for these future bio-refineries will likely differ from those currently used in the petrochemical industry. Biotechnology and chemocatalysis offer routes for converting biomass into a variety of molecules that can serve as platform chemicals. While a host of technologies can be leveraged for biomass upgrading, condensation reactions are significant because they have the potential to upgrade these bio-derived feedstocks while minimizing the loss of carbon and the generation of by-products. This review surveys both the biological and chemical catalytic routes to producing platform chemicals from renewable sources and describes advances in condensation chemistry and strategies for\u00a0the conversion of these platform chemicals into fuels and high-value chemicals.",

     "abstract": "Ultrathin 2D nanosheets, such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), have attracted considerable attention in the last decade. The large lateral size, ultrathin thickness, and high flexibility of these ultrathin 2D nanosheets render them appealing building blocks for constructing new nanostructures via self-assembly, e.g., 3D networks, 1D nanoscrolls, nanotubes, and nanofibers, and 0D nanoparticles. This review summarizes the recent progress on the assembly of ultrathin 2D nanosheets into novel nanostructures with a particular focus on 1D nanostructures. We begin by introducing various methods for the assembly of 2D nanosheets into 1D nanostructures and then discuss their potential applications in energy storage, electronic devices, and sensors. We conclude with the current research progress and some personal perspectives on the challenges and future research directions in this promising area.",

     "abstract": "Self-assembly is invaluable in the construction of giant molecular structures via a bottom-up approach. Although living organisms naturally make the most use of self-assembly and freely handle the mechanism at will, scientists are still far behind the level of nature. Inspired by the elegant structures of virus capsids, we have previously constructed roughly spherical giant metal complexes with the symmetry of an octahedron, cuboctahedron, and rhombicuboctahedron with the compositions M6L12, M12L24, and M24L48, respectively. Here, we report our first successful synthesis of an M30L60 molecular icosidodecahedron that consists of \u223c100 components: 30 Pd(II) ions and 60 ligands that assemble into the largest well-defined spherical macromolecule to date (diameter of \u223c8.2\u00a0nm). Tuning the flexibility of the ligand was the key for successful self-assembly. A highly complex but symmetrically organized structure was identified through X-ray crystallographic analysis. The interior space of the molecular complex is large enough (157,000\u00a0\u00c53) to enclose proteins.",

     "abstract": "Hierarchical hollow nanostructures with complex shell structures are attractive for efficient storage of electrochemical energy. However, reports on the designed formation of such delicate architectures are rare. Starting from a framework of Co-based zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF-67) nanocubes, we demonstrate a template-engaged formation of double-shelled hollow structures with CoS-nanoparticle-assembled nanoboxes surrounded by outer CoS-nanosheet-constructed shells (denoted as CoS-NP/CoS-NS DSNBs). Delicate manipulation of the template-engaged reaction between ZIF-67 and water leads to the formation of ZIF-67/Co(OH)2-nanosheet yolk-shelled structures, which are then transformed into CoS-NP/CoS-NS DSNBs through the reactions with Na2S. As a result of the unique assembly of subunits with different dimensionalities, the CoS-NP/CoS-NS DSNBs have a high specific surface area, suitable mesopores, and good structural robustness, which contribute to exceptional performance as a battery-type electrode. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated by using CoS-NP/CoS-NS DSNBs as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode. Impressively, these optimized devices can be operated stably in a wide potential range of 1.6\u00a0V with greatly enhanced energy density and power capability. The device is stable for 10,000 cycles with a capacitance retention of 88%.",

PUs are usually synthesized by step-growth polymerization and, therefore, exhibit non-uniform molecular structures. Here, we show that uniform PUs can be prepared by a facile chemoselective multistep-growth approach. This strategy permits precise control of the chain lengths of the PUs formed and their primary structure, thus making the preparation of coded monomer sequences possible. Furthermore, it was found that these polymers are remarkably easy to analyze by tandem mass spectrometry sequencing. Thus, these precision polymers can potentially be used as molecular barcodes in various applications. As a proof of concept, their use as anti-counterfeiting tags for identification of materials is reported here.",

     "abstract": "Synthetic transmembrane anion transporters (anionophores) have potential as tools for biomedical research and as therapeutic agents for diseases associated with anion-channel dysfunction. However, the possibility of H+ or OH\u2212 transport by anionophores has received little attention, and an anionophore selective for Cl\u2212 over H+/OH\u2212 is currently unavailable. Here, we show that depending on anionophore acidity, many anionophores facilitate electrogenic H+ or OH\u2212 transport, potentially leading to toxicity. Nevertheless, using several liposome-membrane-based assays, we identified two newly developed small molecules that promote electrogenic Cl\u2212 transport without effectively dissipating the transmembrane pH gradient, essentially mimicking the electrogenic cationophore valinomycin. The Cl\u2212 > H+/OH\u2212 selectivity of anionophores showed a\u00a0consistent positive correlation with the degree of Cl\u2212 encapsulation and a negative correlation with the acidity of hydrogen-bond donors. Our study demonstrates that a valinomycin equivalent for Cl\u2212-selective transport is achievable.",

Because of the electronic properties of the substituent, this compound features a PP multiple bond, similarly to stable singlet aminocarbenes, which feature a nitrogen-carbon double bond. It undergoes a [2\u00a0+ 1] cycloaddition with an electron-poor alkene and a [1\u00a0+ 1] coupling reaction with isonitriles.

Here, we show that a water-stable metal-organic framework, NU-1000, with hierarchical pore structure has the right combination of properties to be particularly well-suited as a scaffold for immobilizing enzymes such that they maintain full enzymatic catalytic activity. The immobilized enzyme shows greater resistance to organic solvent and denaturant than does the free enzyme and is characterized by greater reactant accessibility and higher activity than the same enzyme encapsulated in topologically simpler metal-organic frameworks. These findings suggest design rules for hierarchical pore structuring of host frameworks for enzyme-encapsulation applications by demonstrating enzyme immobilization in a solid support whereby the enzyme is highly accessible and retains catalytic activity under chemically challenging conditions.",
