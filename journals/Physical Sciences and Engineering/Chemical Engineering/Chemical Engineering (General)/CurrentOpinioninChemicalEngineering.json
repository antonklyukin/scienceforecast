     "publication date": "06-2019",
     "abstract": "Elastin is an extracellular matrix protein polymer that imparts tissues with the ability to endure stretch-recoil cycles. The formation of elastin has been explored through its major components, such as the natural precursor tropoelastin and mimics in elastin-like polypeptides, and involves a remarkable process of hierarchical self-assembly at physiological temperatures through interactions principally between their hydrophobic sequences. These properties have made elastin an attractive candidate for incorporation into biomaterials for a range of applications in regenerative medicine. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding how the sequence and structure of elastin influence the thermodynamics that govern the functionality of elastin and its derivatives, and describes innovations in harnessing these mechanisms to create tunable elastin-based biomaterials.",

     "abstract": "Numerical modeling of various processes is widely used in chemical engineering. One of traditionally used tools applied for equilibrium systems is Monte Carlo method that utilizes ensemble averaging of functions to be determined. An alternative approach, kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method, was developed in the 1960s for non-equilibrium systems to study diffusion, chemical reactions, crystal growth, and so on. Recently it became evident that kMC is very efficient in simulation of equilibrium systems and has some advantages over the conventional Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme in case of inhomogeneous systems typical for adsorption phenomena. Most importantly, the kMC algorithm yields a clear physical interpretation of the chemical potential as thermodynamic function related to the molecular flow between the system and thermostat. It is likely that kMC has a potential in further analysis of thermodynamic properties of the adsorbed phase on surfaces or confined in the pore volume of nanomaterials.",

Recently, a thermodynamic approach was proposed to predict the framework flexibility of MOFs against eternal stimuli in a generic way.

     "abstract": "Adsorption heat transformation (AHT) is an environmentally friendly energy-saving process applied for air conditioning purposes, that is, either for cooling (including also ice making and refrigeration), or heating. AHT is based on the cycling adsorption and desorption of a working fluid in a porous material. When the working fluid is driven to evaporation by the active empty sorbent material, the required heat of evaporation translates into useful cooling in thermally driven adsorption chillers. Driving heat regenerates the empty sorbent material through desorption of the working fluid. The heat of adsorption in the sorbent material and the heat of condensation of the working fluid can be used in the adsorption heat-pumping mode. Thus, adsorption heat transformation contributes to energy-saving technologies. Adsorbent development plays a critical role for the improvement of AHT technologies. Besides silica gel and zeolites as adsorbent materials, which are up to now used in the commercially available AHT devices; especially metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are getting more attentions in recent years. Composite materials from salts with silica gels, zeolites and MOFs as well as activated carbons have also been researched to contribute to AHT technologies. Reduction of installation/production cost and enhancement of the efficiency of AHT devices need to be achieved to increase the wider usage of AHT.",

Time-resolved spectroscopy and band shape analysis provide the data on the energy and phase relaxation of vibrational excitation. The energy transfer in the adsorbed layer occurs via resonance dipole\u2013dipole interaction.

Here, we systematically review the computational progresses of stimuli-responsive polymers. Firstly, different scale simulation methods are introduced, including all-atom molecular dynamics (AAMD), coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD), dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), Monte Carlo (MC) and theoretical methods. AAMD was usually adopted to study single chain behaviors of stimuli-responsive polymers; whereas for larger block copolymers and blended systems, CGMD, DPD, MC, and theoretical methods are more suitable methods. Then, recent simulation progresses in studying the conformation transitions of stimuli-responsive polymers are summarized, including simulations of pH, temperature, solvent and photo-responsive polymers. The multiscale modelling and simulations of stimuli-responsive polymers could provide molecular mechanism and theoretical guidance for designing smart materials.",

Although production yield still remains the major focus in CLD&E, product quality and long-term stability have increasingly appeared to be the additional criteria. Towards achieving such goals, various platforms involving high-throughput clonal evaluation in automated manner, efficient vector designs, RNA interference methods and genome editing techniques have been developed to generate highly productive clones much faster with desired quality attributes and cell line traits. Since CHO genome was sequenced, we can now systematically characterize CHO cells using high-throughput omics profiles and in silico computational models, thereby identifying relevant targets for rational cell engineering which can be readily validated by the emerging genome editing techniques in a targeted and precise manner.

     "abstract": "Meeting the metabolic demands of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been an area of intense investigation over the last 3 decades as a means to improve these cell factories as producers of high quality recombinant therapeutic proteins. Metabolically, the cultivation of CHO cells is characterised by the rapid consumption of the primary carbon and energy sources, glucose and glutamine, with lactate and ammonia produced as by-products, respectively. In the context of bioprocess-relevant CHO cell phenotypes, glycolytic metabolism predominates during exponential cell growth culminating in lactate production while glucose channelling through the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle supports high-specific productivity. The genetic diversity inherent among CHO cell lineages (CHO-K1, CHO-S, and CHO-DG44), in addition to clonal isolates, makes media development a complex task which must often be performed on a clone by clone basis. However, designing tailored media formulations and sophisticated feeding regimens based on empirical observation has been one of the main driving forces behind the enhancements seen today in volumetric titres. To add to this complexity, CHO mitochondrial genetics have recently been shown to be heterogeneous resulting in an additional level of genetic pre-programming at the epicentre of cellular energy production. Cajoling CHO cells to utilise resources more efficiently through cell line development strategies, hypothermic adaptation or genetic engineering are areas of considerable interest within the biopharmaceutical community. Genetic re-programming of cellular metabolism through the manipulation of desirable metabolic pathways using microRNAs, siRNAs or gene overexpression have yielded some success. With the advent of sophisticated gene editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9, a better understanding of CHO cell metabolism should drive knowledge-based multi-faceted cell line development pipelines combining both genetic engineering, selection of innately superior clones as well as tailored media formulations to improve the performance of this important therapeutic protein-producing cell line.",

Increased product titres shifted bioprocessing concerns downstream as with increased titre brought along the increased expression of unwanted host cell proteins (HCPs). HCPs are a highly diverse range of proteins. While some HCPs can be degradative to the product itself, others could induce an unwanted immune response compromising the safety and efficacy of the biologic.

Recently, the performance of stable pool and TGE methods has improved dramatically, making them viable options for producing drug substance for GLP-toxicology, early-phase clinical trials, and other scenarios that demand rapid production timelines.

In this short review, we remind the reader how these two methodologies complement each other but also present the fast and recent development of semi-quantitative approaches for modeling large biological networks, with a spectrum of complementary ideas each inheriting and combining features of both modeling formalisms.

Gate-opening of MOFs led to an unexpected selectivity when used as adsorbents, as a result of guest-dependent gate-opening pressure. However, when MOFs were adapted for membrane separations, the framework flexibility sometimes can be disadvantage, resulting in the absence of sharp molecular sieving. This evokes considerable research efforts in recent years to suppress the negative impacts of framework flexibility, for example, hindering the gate-opening effects, on the gas separation performance of MOF membranes.

Among all SO4\u2212 activation techniques, the heterogeneous activation of precursor peroxides such as peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate (PS) by nanostructured materials has demonstrated to be an effective method to generate SO4\u2212. This paper reviews SO4\u2212 chemistry and the nanostructured materials that can effectively activate PMS/PS, namely, transition metal-based nano-catalysts, carbon nanomaterials, and nano-composites. In addition, we also discuss the activation mechanisms of PMS/PS initiated by heterogeneous nanostructured materials, emphasizing their catalytic activity, stability, and reusability for the removal of organic contaminants. This review shows that nanostructured materials have promising potential in environmental remediation based on their excellent catalytic efficiency, large specific surface area, and controllable structure. It also provides perspective on potential future studies on the design of novel nanostructured materials and process development in the field of SO4\u2212 based AOTs.",

The physical properties such as frictional properties of quasicrystalline materials are more exciting because the structures of quasicrystal are different from the both conventional crystalline and amorphous phases. This article summarizes the general overview of the research conducted in the field of frictional properties of various quasiperiodic intermetallic systems.

Focusing on physical inhomogeneities, this paper presents an overview of the field of polymer adsorption on rough surfaces, and seeks to elucidate some of the relevant molecular mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to study freely rotating chains adjacent to self-affine substrates, exploring the influence of surface fractal dimension and amplitude. The adsorbed polymers are characterized by density profiles and chain topologies evaluated parallel and perpendicular to the nominal surface. Our results reveal chain attachment and film structure can be controlled solely by manipulating entropic factors such as surface physical heterogeneities and adsorbate molecular weight distributions.",

Purposely grown energy crops (wood and grasses) and crop residues (corn stalks, sugarcane bagasse, and wheat straw) are available for conversion to biofuels if attractive process economics are achieved in hydrolyzing these lignocellulosic materials to sugars and converting the sugars to biofuels and bioproducts. Cellulase enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose to glucose currently contribute operating expenses of $0.15\u2013$0.20 per liter of ethanol out of a total of $0.53. The goal is to decrease enzyme costs to 3\u20135\u00a0\u00a2/L. The high cost is in part due to the high loading of cellulases needed to make up activity losses when the enzymes bind to lignin rather than the cellulose substrate that is located in close proximity to the lignin. We address the concept of using liquid chromatography columns packed with biomass to efficiently probe partitioning of cellulases and other proteins on the surfaces of various forms of lignocellulose. The correlation of elution profiles to fundamental adsorption behavior provides a pathway to a deeper understanding of inhibition of cellulose hydrolysis due to interactions of proteins at heterogeneous lignocellulosic interfaces.",

Current biorefineries producing first generation biofuels from food crops have impacted nexus resources, most notoriously land and food but also water and fossil energy resources required during cultivation and processing. Solutions to the nexus challenges of biorefineries require the search for alternative feedstocks and the application of methods that capture opportunities for synergistic interactions with the nexus. At the process level, more efficient water and energy use and food production could be possible if methods for extensive biomass fractionation, process integration and optimisation are developed. There is also a great opportunity to include the interactions between biomass supply and the nexus sectors in value chain optimisation to find strategic integrations that improve productivity and reduce losses and environmental impacts. By incorporating opportunities into a whole systems approach for design and planning, biorefineries will be able to balance nexus resource trade-offs, deliver their potential for full exploitation of biomass as the only source of renewable carbon and materials, and translate nexus issues into social welfare and sustainable development.",

Within hosts, pathogens are bombarded with combinations of toxic compounds by immune cells, and bacteria have evolved numerous strategies to survive those antimicrobial assaults. Disruption of those defenses could sensitize bacteria to immune attacks and lead to new anti-infective modalities. To realize such therapies, deep understanding of how bacteria cope with those toxic cocktails is desirable. We propose that methods from biochemical engineering can help provide such knowledge and serve as complementary approaches to those that directly use phagocytes. Here, we summarize the rationale for pursuing immune-potentiating anti-infectives, review recent efforts that employ engineering approaches to examine phagosomal stressors and their antibacterial activity, and discuss how biochemical engineering can contribute further to this exciting field.",

In this paper, a systematic methodology based on plant-wide dynamic simulation is presented for safety-oriented CPI FMs under abnormal operating conditions. Since off-specification emission sources are inevitable during abnormal operating conditions, to significantly reduce flaring emission in a chemical plant, they must be either recycled to the upstream process for online reuse, or stored somewhere temporarily for future reprocessing. Thus, the off-spec products could be reused instead of being flared. Together with the new development of FM operating strategies, rigorous dynamic simulation based safety checks are also highlighted in the presented methodology. Two case studies on FMs for start-up and shut-down operations of an ethylene plant have been employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed study.",

Despite the great importance of the SEI in Si-based anodes on the cycling performance of the LIBs, a deeper understanding of the SEI evolution, composition, and morphology is still lacking. In this article, we briefly review the recent findings in the field of computational materials science regarding the initial stages and growth of the SEI layer on silicon anodes.",

TiO2 photocatalysts decompose natural algal toxins such as microcystin-LR and cylindrospermopsin under solar light irradiation.

     "abstract": "Zeolites belong to microporous solids that are widely used as adsorbents, catalysts and catalyst supports. As diffusion in the microspores is slow, it is highly desirable to develop approaches to enhance mass transfer or to avoid the negative effect from mass transfer resistance. In this perspective, we underline pore architecture control for hierarchical zeolite, and spatial locations of metal nanoparticles on zeolite. For solid acid catalysts, the construction of auxiliary porosity in crystalline zeolites leading to the formation of hierarchical zeolite is a promising solution. Most successful pore-architecture construction strategies are based on templating approaches within the classic LaMer crystallization framework, whereas our strategies are based on the non-classic orientated attachment growth mechanism in dry gel crystallization. Organic additives, such as organosilanes, can be incorporated with protozeolite particles to produce hybrid mesocrystals. Combustion of organics in the mesocrystal affords hierarchical beta zeolites, the pore-architecture of which is tunable with respect to additive selection. Such a crystallization based design of pore-architecture merits small primary crystal size and improved pore-connectivity, which have been verified to be the key factors that affect diffusion. On the other hand, for zeolite supported metal catalysts that suffer from deactivation caused by pore blocking, we propose a strategy to avoid the deactivation problem by depositing metal nanoparticles exclusively on the external surfaces of support. This can be achieved by simply leaving the structure directing agents in the pores before supporting metal particles. Side reactions caused by diffusion resistance are minimized, and moreover, the involatile byproducts, if any, do not produce additional diffusion resistance. Such a simple yet effective architecture control significantly prolongs the lifetime of Au/TS-1 catalyst in direct propene epoxidation with H2 and O2. From these demonstrations, it is important to design purpose-orientated zeolite synthesis to enhance mass transfer, for which the architecture plays a key role.",

But making the best choice among various available resources, process technologies and supply chain designs is no simple task, especially when sustainability is a criterion. Additional complexity arises because the relevant factors will be weighted differently by different constituencies. The risk of unintended consequences must also be considered: what can seem to be good decisions may prove unsustainable in the long term unless all potential implications can be assessed. To addresses these challenges an integrated approach including discrete event simulation is required due to the necessity to evaluate the effects of uncertainty over an extended time horizon.",

     "abstract": "Most applications of pervaporation today are in solvent dehydration. This is about to change, considering the new trends in membrane development and the needs in chemical engineering. This paper identifies three areas in which pervaporation can become a breakthrough technology, if the right direction in development is chosen: organophilic separation, membrane reactors and bioethanol upgrading. The most attention is paid to the development of more selective membranes. Even though such membranes are needed, this should be complemented by scale-up and engineering efforts, to make penetration into the market possible, and to find creative engineered solutions based on hybrids and cascades, in which the separation of a single step can be enhanced.For organophilic separations, many membrane materials have already been developed today, with a potential that is still unexplored; some hints on membrane materials of interest are given in the paper. For membrane reactors, chemical engineers should make use of the vast potential of this technology by designing applications with added value in chemicals production. The use of membranes in bioethanol production is hampered by the performance of current membranes; however, this is more related to the flux than to the selectivity.",

Second, the development of process designs that balance permeability and selectivity to achieve maximum efficiency are considered.

Fluorinated ionomers continue to dominate the fuel cell membrane landscape and it is unlikely that a hydrocarbon polymer will supplant these materials anytime soon, especially for automotive applications. Promising strategies for improving membrane performance and durability in a hydrogen/air fuel cell include the use of ultra-low equivalent weight semicrystalline ionomers, covalently attaching conductive and water retaining particles to an ionomer, and adding a porous/nanofiber reinforcements to minimize in-plane swelling and shrinking.

The formation of intermediate amorphous carbonato complex during high-energy ball milling was found to be essential for the formation of NaNbO3 (NN), KNbO3 (KN), and (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN) during the further milling or subsequent calcination. The synthesis behavior was dependent on the relative magnitude of the activation energy barrier and the cumulative kinetic energy. Since LiNbO3 and NN powders were relatively easily synthesized by planetary milling for a short time, their activation energies were thought to be low. Only a small fraction of KN and no KNN powders were synthesized by planetary milling indicating their higher activation energy. Even KNN has a high activation energy, mechanochemical synthesis of KNN powders could be achieved by applying shaker milling which was thought to provide higher cumulative kinetic energy. From the viewpoint of practical applications, mechanochemical activation-assisted process will be recommended for the synthesis of KNN rather than mechanochemical synthesis because the latter produced severely agglomerated powders which resulted in poor sinterability.",

Most are currently administered as a single molecule to treat a single disease; however there is mounting evidence that cocktails of multiple antibodies, each with a unique binding specificity and protective mechanism, may improve clinical efficacy. Here, we review progress in the development of oligoclonal combinations of antibodies to treat disease, focusing on identification of synergistic antibodies. We then discuss the application of modern antibody engineering technologies to produce highly potent antibody preparations, including oligoclonal antibody cocktails and truly recombinant polyclonal antibodies. Specific examples illustrating the synergy conferred by multiple antibodies will be provided for diseases caused by botulinum toxin, cancer and immune thrombocytopenia. The bioprocessing and regulatory options for these preparations will be discussed.",

One approach that has shown excellent potential in preclinical and clinical evaluation is molecular imaging with small-scaffold, non-antibody based, engineered proteins. These novel diagnostic agents produce high contrast images due to their fast clearance from the bloodstream and healthy tissues, can be evolved to bind a multitude of cancer biomarkers, and are easily functionalized by site-specific bioconjugation methods. Several small protein scaffolds have been verified for in vivo molecular imaging including affibodies and their two-helix variants, knottins, fibronectins, designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), and several natural ligands. Further, the biodistribution of these engineered ligands can be optimized through rational mutation of the conserved regions, careful selection and placement of chelator, and modification of molecular size.",

Such events also span multiple time domains from the fast molecular reactions governing gene expression to the slower cell cycle and division. Thus, the development of multiscale computational frameworks for stem cell populations is highly desirable. Multiscale models are expected to aid the design of efficient differentiation strategies and bioprocesses for the generation of therapeutically useful stem cell progeny.

As tissues become larger, thicker and more complex, the vascular network becomes crucial for supplying nutrients and maintaining viability and growth of the neo-organ. Perfusion decellularization, the process of removing cells from an entire organ, leaves the matrix of the vascular network intact. Organ engineering requires a delicate process of decellularization, sterilization, reseeding with appropriate cells, and organ maturation and stimulation to ensure optimal development. The design of bioreactors to facilitate this sequence of events has been refined to the extent that some bioartificial organs grown in these systems have been transplanted into recipient animals with sustained, though limited, function.

Using stoichiometric and energetic analyses, we assess the efficiencies of four non-photosynthetic CO2 fixation pathways of practical importance, with a focus on engineered strains. The analysis compares the pathways based on their ATP and H2/electron requirements, the number of enzymes required, and the production of three model chemicals: ethanol, acetate, and butanol. Our analysis shows that the Wood\u2013Ljungdahl (WL) pathway is the most efficient, based on the most expensive substrate (i.e. H2 or electrons), for the production of acetate and ethanol. Chemoautotrophically, butanol formation is an ATP-limited process, making anaerobic production from the WL pathway inefficient; however, higher potential butanol titers are predicted for the aerobic pathways. Mixotrophic growth, in which organic substrates are fed alongside H2/CO2, alleviates the ATP limitations and thus improves the yields for both aerobic and anaerobic butanol production. We also calculate maximal yields, both chemoautotrophic and mixotrophic, based on the WL pathway for two other important molecules: 2,3-butanediol and butyrate.",

Optimization was pointed out as a possible path to follow aiming at building tools that can help the involved decision makers. From that time onwards several works have explored this pathway but there is still space for improvement, especially due to the outer shell of new emerging problems. The present paper provides a brief review of the progress that has been made on process industry SCs focusing in recent years (2008 onwards).

     "abstract": "The paper contains a review of recent work by Process Systems Engineering (PSE) researchers in biomedical systems. The review is organised in the following four categories: analysis of systems corresponding to diagnosis of a condition, model simulation providing predictions resulting in a potential use for prognosis, design for an optimal action or set of actions based on a model and set of objectives which corresponds to devising a therapy, and operations where sets of patient data may be used to manage patient well-being or a disease condition. There has been work particularly in glucose regulation involving the liver system (the body's \u2018chemical factory\u2019), in the brain, in the pulmonary system, and to a lesser extent in some other parts of the body. There is evidence of useful proposed clinical outcomes. So far there is little evidence of clinical use of the results. There is a need for better models, handling of uncertainty to ensure conservative (and where possible guaranteed) predictions, and for greater interaction with the clinical community. There is real potential for much greater use of PSE approaches to these complex systems.",

Management of the mineral acids used in pretreatment steps remains a challenge, but proper organic solvent selection, such as 2-sec-butylphenol, allows for complete recovery and recycle of mineral acid. Using solvents with high partition coefficients for extraction of products in biphasic unit operations allows the concentrations of products to be increased and improves the efficiency of downstream processing options, such as distillation or further upgrading reactions.

The changes and the pace of these changes have increased the need for improved water management and wastewater minimisation. The adoption of water minimisation techniques can effectively reduce overall fresh water demand in water using processes and subsequently reduce the amount of effluent generated.

Second, nano-confinement with carefully balanced forces at multiple scales creates structured environments with superior catalytic performance. Finally, nature employs dynamics to form synergistic and adaptable organizations from simple components.

Since membrane shear rates are the key factor governing their performance, three equations are given to calculate the shear rates of various modules, with disks rotating near fixed membranes, rotating membranes on a single shaft and vibrating membranes such as in the VSEP. Recent applications taken from the literature confirm the large gains relatively to crossflow filtration in permeate flux and membrane selectivity, owing to large reductions in cake formation and concentration polarization. One of the advantages of this technology is that, with rotating membranes, it gives a choice between increasing the flux by factor of 3\u20135 as compared to crossflow filtration by using high rotation speeds or obtaining the same flux at low speed, but with a large energy saving. The power consumed by vibrations in large industrial VSEP units is small, owing to the use of resonance frequency.",

     "abstract": "Amine scrubbing will be an important technology for CO2 capture and storage. The degradation of the amine at 100\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C limits the maximum T/P and therefore the energy performance of the solvent regeneration. This is a review of the rate, products, and mechanisms of thermal degradation. Primary and secondary ethanolamines and ethylenediamines degrade at 100\u2013130\u00a0\u00b0C as they form cyclic oxazolidinones and ureas. Tertiary amines can be more resistant to degradation if they do not include methyl and ethanol groups. Piperazine structures and long chain diamines such as hexamethylenediamine degrade by ring opening and closing and can be used at 150\u2013160\u00a0\u00b0C. Thermal degradation can produce products that are more volatile than the parent amines.",

Molecular imprinting method is an easy way to introduce molecular recognition sites into synthetic membranes. Applying an alternative molecular imprinting, various polymeric materials can be converted into membranes with molecular recognition sites toward a given target molecule. In membrane separation, flux values, and permselectivities, which often show a trade-off relationship, are important membrane performances. In a sense, the enhancement of flux is more important than that of permselectivity. Molecularly imprinted nanofiber membranes, which are fabricated by simultaneously applying an alternative molecular imprinting and an electrospray deposition, have potential that both flux and permselectivity can be simultaneously enhanced.",

The economic viability of these processes is often limited by inhibition of the biocatalyst by the metabolic product, such as a carboxylic acid or alcohol, or by contaminant compounds in the biomass-derived sugars, such as acetic acid or furans. Historically, selection-based methods have been used to improve biocatalyst tolerance to these inhibitors. But recently, genome-wide analysis has been used to both identify the mechanism of inhibition and reverse engineer inhibitor-tolerant strains, enabling the rational, predictive manipulation of bacteria in order to increase inhibitor tolerance. Here we review recent work in this area, particularly in relation to carboxylic acids, furfural and butanol.",

Energy efficiency calculations of biomass preparation and conversion processes indicate petroleum displacements ranging from 3% to 40%, depending on the specific biofuel production process. Consideration of other energy consuming processes during fuel delivery could result in petroleum consumption instead of displacement for some of the proposed next generation biofuel production processes.",

     "abstract": "Carbon capture in a postcombustion scenario needs cost-effective and energy-efficient alternatives to the amine process. High performance membranes can potentially meet the stringent cost targets set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). In this context, we review and identify the most promising membranes/membrane materials along with the most innovative membrane-based processes reported recently in literature. The important transport results were grouped into different categories depending upon the mechanism of selective CO2 transport through the respective membrane. The analysis of the literature results indicates that each type of membrane demonstrates one or more of the important trade-offs including selectivity\u2013permeability, selectivity\u2013permeance, transport-ease of synthesis, and transport\u2013stability. Reproducible and large-scale production of thin films from existing and new highly permeable materials while maintaining a reasonable selectivity along with innovation in process schemes that utilize multiple membranes with different and unique benefits were identified as key tasks to realizing a membrane-based alternative for this application.",

     "abstract": "Researchers worldwide have been measuring properties of amine-based scrubbing solutions, seeking alternatives to aqueous monoethanolamine that will reduce the costs of flue gas CO2 capture (FGCC). Because the operating costs of FGCC are closely tied to the stripper reboiler duty (QReb), many laboratories have been screening for low heats of desorption, \u0394HDes. Recently, their logic was challenged on the grounds that QReb has three components, one of which is greater when \u0394HDes is higher, another of which is greater when \u0394HDes is lower. This paper supports that argument and concludes that the complex dependence of QReb on \u0394HDes, and on other amine properties, makes process simulation a necessary adjunct to rational amine screening.",

Most efforts toward sustainability in engineering, including these, focus on enhancing efficiency of resource and energy use for a process or life cycle. Unfortunately, these efforts need not lead to sustainability. Additional efforts are required to address several challenges. These include accounting for the role of ecosystem services in life cycle analysis and decision making, considering the strong multidisciplinary, complex and wicked nature of the sustainability challenge.

     "publication date": "10-2011",
     "abstract": "Despite much progress in the development of zeolite molecular sieve membranes, there is so far no industrial gas separation by zeolite membranes, with the exception of the de-watering of bio-ethanol by steam permeation using LTA membranes. During the last 5 years, metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) membranes have been developed and tested in gas separation. The complete tool box of techniques originally developed for the preparation of zeolite membranes could be applied for the preparation of MOF membranes, such as the use of macroporous ceramic or metal supports, seeding, intergrowth-supporting additives, and microwave heating. There are some structure-related properties of MOFs which recommend them as suitable material for molecular sieve membranes. On the other hand, the structural flexibility of MOFs apparently prevents a sharp molecular sieving with a pore size estimated from the \u2018rigid\u2019 crystallographic structure by size exclusion. An application of MOFs is predicted in so-called mixed matrix membranes which show improved performance in comparison with the pure polymer membranes. Different from zeolites as organic\u2013inorganic material, the MOF nanoparticles can be easily embedded into organic polymers, and standard shaping technologies to hollow fibers or spiral wound geometries can be applied.",

Additionally, the waste production can be reduced as a result of the higher mixing efficiency and better control of chemical conversion processes, which reduces environmental impact and increases resource efficiency. The thin-film spinning disc (TFSD), the rotor\u2013stator spinning disc (RSSD), and a combination of these, are highly attractive for highly reactive, exothermic reactions in multiphase systems. A barrier for industrial application is its success: demonstration requires hazardous chemicals in large quantities and flows and is not easily done in university laboratories.
