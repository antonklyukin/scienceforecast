     "abstract": "This paper is to study the unauthorized urban neighborhoods, which cause critical multifaceted difficulties. It explores the reasons that have resulted in the unauthorized urban neighborhoods generally and in Chabahar city particularly. This paper has performed a case study to analyze the socioeconomic, spatial, skeletal, and functional effects of the illegal neighborhoods in the Chabahar city with the help of academic methods and field observations. It reviews various theoretical ideas and experiences could assist the rehabilitation and reconstructing of the unauthorized urban districts. It discusses optimal strategic regional/urban revitalization planning procedures to solve the problems in Chabahar. Finally, this paper suggests a renewal/rebuilding possible development program, including eight mother projects. The results of the renewal program will be substituted with the present informal and eroded neighborhoods in the city. The renewal program made progress in both physical features of the city and urban life quality indicators simultaneously. The model suggested by this paper will be feasible in similar regions everywhere.",

     "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase both the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events, which may lead to more intense and frequent river flooding. This study aims to assess the flood hazard potential under climate change scenarios in Yang River Basin of Thailand. A physically-based distributed hydrological model, Block-wise use of TOPMODEL using Muskingum-Cunge flow routing (BTOPMC) and hydraulic model, HEC-RAS was used to simulate the floods under future climate scenarios. Future climate scenarios were constructed from the bias corrected outputs of three General Circulation Models (GCMs) for 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Results show that basin will get warmer and wetter in future. Both the minimum and maximum temperature of the basin is projected to increase in future. Similarly average annual rainfall is also projected to increase in future, higher in near future and lower in far future. The extreme runoff pattern and synthetic inflow hydrographs for 25, 50 and 100\u00a0year return flood were derived from an extreme flood of 2007 which were then fed into HEC-RAS model to generate the flood inundation maps in the basin. The intensity of annual floods is expected increase for both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Compared to the baseline period, an additional 60\u00a0km2 area of basin is projected to be flooded with the return period of 100\u00a0years. The results of this study will be helpful to formulate adaptation strategies to offset the negative impacts of flooding on different land use activities in Yang River Basin.",

The data used are the 2006 Housing Characteristics and Amenities tables which were sourced from Nigeria\u2019s National Population Commission (National Population Commission, 2006). Principal Component Analysis extracted three components. Component 1 accounting for 38% has electricity, water closet toilet, hygienic sources of water and high quality roofing, walling and flooring materials highly loaded on it. Component 2 (31%) comprised inferior walling, roofing and flooring materials, pit toilet, traditional and semi-detached house types, while component 3 (7%) had mainly zinc wall and public toilet highly loaded on it. Using these factor loadings as variables in discriminant analysis, three distinct regions of differing housing quality emerged corresponding to the western, eastern and northern geographical regions of the country with 97.3% of the states correctly classified and with the western (high) and northern (low) states at the opposite ends of the quality scale. It is recommended that non-conforming buildings, particularly, residential, and insanitary environment should be put in check through very strict and proactive enforcement of development control edicts and sanitary laws.",

     "abstract": "An overview of recent research related to building renovation has revealed that efforts to date do not address sustainability issues comprehensively. The question then arises in regard to the holistic sustainability objectives within building renovation context. In order to deal with this question, the research adopts a multi-dimensional approach involving literature review, exploration of existing assessment methods and methodologies, individual and focus group interviews, and application of Soft Systems Methodologies (SSM) with Value Focused Thinking (VFT). In doing so, appropriate data about sustainability objectives have been collected and structured, and subsequently verified using a Delphi study. A sustainability framework was developed in cooperation with University of Palermo and Aarhus University to audit, develop and assess building renovation performance, and support decision-making during the project\u2019s lifecycle. The paper represents the results of research aiming at addressing sustainability of the entire renovation effort including new categories, criteria, and indicators. The developed framework can be applied during different project stages and to assist in the consideration of the sustainability issues through support of decision-making and communication with relevant stakeholders. Early in a project, it can be used to identify key performance criteria, and later to evaluate/compare the pros and cons of alternative retrofitting solutions either during the design stage or upon the project completion. According to the procedure of the consensus-based process for the development of an effective sustainability decision-making framework which was employed in this study, the outcome can also be considered as an outset step intended for the establishment of a Decision Support Systems (DSS) and assessment tool suited to building renovation context.",

This is not prescribed to meet the effluent nitrogen levels (<10\u00a0mg/l) as per Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive 98/15/EC. In order to improve the denitrification efficiency and the subsequent removal of nitrogen from the municipal wastewater as per the above European Commission guidelines, modified process was formulated with pre-anaerobic and post-aerobic activated sewage treatment processes. The modified process includes the rise in ambient temperature up to 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C by using heat exchangers in Increased Technology and Efficiency in Sewage Treatment (ITEST) pilot plant at the Swedish Environmental Research Institute (IVL) laboratory. The experiments were conducted with the modified process of sewage water in one line (treatment line (TL)) and the existing process in another line (reference line (RL)) of the pilot plant. The physical (such as Temperature, Suspended solids and Sludge volume) and chemical (ammonium-nitrate (NH4+-N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3\u2212-N) and total-nitrogen (TN)) parameters were analyzed. The results concluded that the NH4+-N, NO3\u2212-N and TN concentrations of treated waste water were satisfactory with a concentration of <10\u00a0mg/l as per the European Directives 98/15/EEC at treatment line as compared to influent and reference lines.

Given the lack of empirical evidence on the energy performance of school buildings in cold climates, this study aimed to benchmark historical energy consumption over a ten-year period in a sample of 30 school buildings in Manitoba, Canada. Results showed the median total energy consumption of these schools was higher than other Canadian benchmarks. School building age had a statistically significant effect on their energy consumption, with newer schools consuming less gas but more electricity than older and middle-aged ones. The retrofits implemented in some schools did not for the most part have a statistically significant effect on their energy consumption, although a decrease in energy consumption was observed. The results also showed that middle-aged schools were the largest energy consumers, with the results changing depending on the metric used to report on schools\u2019 energy consumption, reinforcing the need to standardize those metrics. There is also a need to investigate how occupancy may be contributing to the increase in electricity consumption in newer schools. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence on existing school buildings\u2019 energy consumption in Manitoba, establishing benchmarks that practitioners can make use of in similar cold climates.",

We adopt principles from landscape ecology and urban planning to evaluate urban heterogeneity and morphology that may constitute more sustainable urban forms, including connectivity, density, geometric complexity (mixed land use), diversity, and greening. Using 2-D wavelet multiresolution analysis and satellite-derived fractional vegetation cover (Fr), the variability of landscape metrics from Landsat (30\u00a0m) to MODIS (1\u00a0km) scales are investigated. According to our findings, metrics of Patch Density and Landscape Shape Index can be used at the 1-km scale to asses density and geometric complexity of urban form. With the addition of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data, available at high temporal resolution, a move away from or toward more sustainable urban forms is defined in relation to mitigation of the urban heat island. As the geometric complexity and density of finer-scale urban characteristics are related to climatic impacts at the neighborhood scale, sustainability assessments may be more attainable across urban areas.",

Malacca City has undergone a tremendous growth during the last decades, particularly after its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. As a result of urban development, two dominant urban configurations were formed in Malacca: the heritage site and contemporary urban areas. This study examines the effects of aspect ratio (H/W) on air temperature in two urban configurations in Malacca. The three-dimensional microclimatic modelling system ENVI-met (version 3.1) was used to simulate the summer time air temperature variation in the typical urban setting of a heritage site and contemporary urban area. Aspect ratio was found to have a considerable influence on the air temperature distribution in both areas. The daytime air temperatures decreased with increasing aspect ratio. The simulation results showed that during the daytime, the heritage site (aspect ratio of 2.6) was warmer than the contemporary urban area (average value of H/W\u00a0=\u00a01.6), and that cooling occurred more quickly in the latter. The results of this study provide useful information for planning, building and modifying urban structures.",

     "abstract": "Decision making on buildings after the earthquake have always been a great concern of scientists. Safety concerns, possibility of using the building, repairing the building, and the rate of damage are some of the most vital factors that needs to be paid attention in immediate decision makings of the buildings. In order to determine the level of damage in the buildings, the maximum displacement of stories is one of the most important parameter that needs to be investigated. In this paper, a concrete frame with shear wall containing 4-stories and 4-bays has been designed for acceleration records of 0.1\u00a0g to 1.5\u00a0g and the rate of damage is determined. The total of 450 data with 6 input variables and one output variable is produced. The input parameters are defined as frequency, Vs, Richter, the distance from the earthquake epicentre (DEE), PGA, and acceleration, and the output parameter is defined as drift. With respect to this data set, three different data-driven models, i.e. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Multiple Linear Regression Model (MLR) are used to predict the displacements. Results indicate that Both the ANN and ANFIS model show great accuracies in estimating the displacements in concrete frame with shear wall. On the other hand, MLR model did not show acceptable accuracy in the same estimation purposes. Finally, the sensitivity analysis was performed on the data set and it was observed that the accuracy of the predictions highly depends on the number of input parameters. In other words, increasing the number of input parameters would result in the increase in the accuracy of the final prediction results.",

     "abstract": "Nearly 30% of total population and over 2\u00a0million students of Delhi spent above 1/3rd of their daily time in different office buildings and educational institutions of Delhi, of which the ambient air quality is reportedly worst in the globe. However, studies on indoor air quality of non-residential buildings are scarce in India. Present study was conducted in two office buildings and one educational building in Delhi during pre-monsoon. CO2, PM2.5 and VOCs were measured inside each building at every 5\u00a0min interval between 9:30\u00a0AM and 5:30\u00a0PM for 5\u00a0days every week. The average CO2 concentration in both office buildings (1513\u00a0ppm and 1338\u00a0ppm) was recorded much higher than the ASHRAE standard. Ductless air-conditioning system couple with poor air-circulation and active air-filtration could be attributed to significantly higher concentration of PM2.5 in one of the office buildings (43.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m\u22123). However, there was significant variation in the concentration of different pollutants at different locations in a building. Among different non-residential buildings, significantly lower concentration of all pollutants was recorded in the educational building (CO2: 672\u00a0ppm; PM2.5: 22.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m\u22123 and VOC: 0.08\u00a0ppm).

Thermal comfort of eight vernacular buildings that use modern construction materials to improve the structural durability was monitored in July 2014. The buildings are located in Hyderabad, India. They have many passive cooling features that include air cavities in the structures to reduce heat transfer, high thermal mass to reduce temperature fluctuation and induced ventilation to remove heat from the indoor. All the passive cooling features investigated were found to have an appreciable influence on the thermal comfort of the indoor space. The ventilated air gaps in the roof reduced the average temperature of the roof interior surface by 1.2\u00a0\u00b0C. The diurnal temperature fluctuation of the indoor air reduced by 0.9\u00a0\u00b0C in a building with a higher thermal mass compared to a building with thin walls and roof. All the eight buildings were found to be comfortable most of the time with a slight discomfort during late night and morning hours. The maximum CO2 recorded was 550\u00a0ppm. This indicates that the buildings were adequately ventilated.",

Water from other sources also contributes to the total water supply in China. Water from other sources includes supplies from wastewater treatment, rain collection, seawater desalinization and other water projects. The result shows that a cubic unit increase in withdrawals from other sources results in about 3% change in gross water supply in China. A cubic unit withdrawal of water for industrial use results in about 29% increase in water use in China. For the agriculture sector, the result shows that a cubic unit increase in agriculture usage leads to approximately 67% increase in total water use in China.

     "abstract": "Water supply and sanitation services are essential to human and environmental well-being. Globally one of the biggest challenges to sustainable development is lack of access to improved water supply and sanitation services. Yet it is less obvious what sustainable development means in countries with high coverage of these services. In this article sustainable development is explored from the perspective of Finnish water supply and sanitation services. The study consists of eight semi-structured interviews with water sector experts and their views are analysed in relation to literature. In this article sustainable development is understood as a learning process and dialogue of values.The interviewed water sector experts primarily perceive sustainable development from an environmental point of view, and treat it in a rationalistic and mechanistic manner. Challenges are tackled by technological fixes, such as improving energy and material efficiency. It is argued in this paper that this kind of approach undermines the complexity and dynamicity of sustainable development and can suppress learning. Sustainable development is mostly explored only from the perspective of water services, although some of the interviewees recognise their role for wider societal development. Interaction and dialogue between water sector experts and the community regarding sustainable development is lacking or skills to accomplish this interaction are inadequate.",

     "abstract": "The world has seen the development and growth of urban areas at a faster pace. The rapid urban growth and development have resulted in the increase in the share of India\u2019s urban population from 79\u00a0million in 1961 that was about 17.92 percent of India\u2019s total population to 388\u00a0million in 2011 that is 31.30 percent of India\u2019s total population. This fast rate of increase in urban population is mainly due to large scale migration of people from rural and smaller towns to bigger cities in search of better employment opportunities and better quality of life. Urban sprawl has resulted in loss of productive agricultural lands, open green spaces and loss of surface water bodies. Hence, there is a dire need to study, understand and quantify the urban sprawl. In this study, an attempt has been made to monitor land use/land cover of part of Dehradun city over two periods of time i.e., from 2004 to 2014 for change detection analysis and to assess urban sprawl using IRS P-6 data and topographic sheets, in GIS environment for better decision making and sustainable urban growth.",

     "abstract": "This study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis and mapping requirements for three arsenic mitigation technologies sponsored by the government of India in the state of Bihar, offering recommendations for the technologies most likely to benefit 12 million at-risk people. The three arsenic mitigation technologies investigated in this paper are arsenic treatment (ATU) units, new hand pump (NHP) units, and new tube wells with stand post (NTWSP) units. For 100% coverage of arsenic mitigation in the arsenic-affected districts of Bihar, 314\u20135111 ATU and NHP and 16\u2013256 NTWSP in Buxar and Jehanabad, respectively, are required. NHP and NTWSP units were found to be the most cost-effective arsenic mitigation interventions in the state, whereas ATU was found to be the dominant intervention. Installation of NHP could be the most efficient arsenic mitigation intervention in areas where the population is scarce and illiterate. NTWSP could be the most cost-effective arsenic mitigation intervention in regions having higher rates of literacy and of arsenic awareness among their communities. The cost-effectiveness of arsenic mitigation technologies should be carefully evaluated before designing and implementing arsenic mitigation policies.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents the effect of silica fume (SF) on early-age and long-term mechanical properties of recycled aggregate concrete containing slag. In this study six series of mixes are considered. The first series is control concrete containing 100% ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and 100% natural aggregates. The second series is similar to the first series in every aspect except the natural coarse aggregate (NCA) which was partially replaced by 50% (by wt.) recycled coarse aggregate (RCA). The third series is also similar to the second series except the OPC which is partially replaced by 50% slag. The effects of 5, 10 and 15% (by wt.) SF on mechanical properties of concrete is evaluated in fourth, fifth and sixth series, respectively. Compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of above concretes are measured at 3, 7, 28, 56 and 91\u202fdays. Results show that the addition of 50% slag significantly reduced the above mechanical properties of concrete containing 50% RCA at early age. Among three SF contents, the 10% SF improved the above mechanical properties of recycled aggregate concrete containing slag at early ages (3 and 7\u202fdays) as well as at 28\u202fdays. The addition of 10% SF also improved the 56 and 91\u202fdays compressive and tensile strengths of recycled aggregate concrete containing slag. It is also found that the long-term (56 and 91\u202fdays) compressive and tensile strengths of recycled aggregate concrete containing slag and 10% SF are even higher than the OPC concrete containing 50% RCA and control concrete, respectively. It is also observed that the slow pozzolanic reaction of slag contributed to the long-term compressive and tensile strengths of recycled aggregate concrete containing slag and 10% SF. Strong correlations of measured compressive strength with indirect tensile strength and elastic modulus of above environmentally friendly concretes are also established.",

The town is famous for its world archaeological sites, but its inhabitants and the local community in general seem to appreciate more its exceptional landscape than the universal archaeological values conferred to it by UNESCO. The particular townscape clearly delimited by the Mediterranean Sea and the Chenoua Mountain seems to have strongly influenced people\u2019s mental images and attachments to their town. Based on the concepts of environmental representation and place attachment, local-community\u2019s sense of place is investigated at three territorial scales: the town centre, the town as a whole and the region. Since the sense of place is defined as a multidimensional attitude including cognitive, conative and affective aspects, the proposed paper examines the socio-cognitive dimension through the structural approach of social representations where shared socio-cognitive meanings are assumed to constitute the central core of environmental representations. On the other hand, the conative component has been investigated through the analysis of expected activities in favourite places. Moreover, place attachment, an affective bond between people and environmental setting, is explored through two sub-concepts: place identity which refers to the cognitive level and place dependence which refers to the conative level. By exploring shared local community\u2019s meanings and their impact on place preferences and appropriation, the research aims at showing the value of townscapes and particularly coastal ones in urban development projects. Natural features such as the sea are powerful landmarks and have strong impact on people\u2019s perceptions of environmental settings.",

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is characterized by a large area of significant climatic changes. In this research, five criteria are identified to compare and select one of the most popular ventilation systems, mechanical or natural. The identified criteria include Energy efficiency in buildings, Building function, Thermal comfort, the Maintenance cost of building, and Microclimatic conditions. The use of a mechanical system may be useful for achieving the building function and thermal comfort, while it seems to be more expensive. On the other hand, the natural ventilation system saves energy in the long run but it may not meet a comfort level for many users. Three regions which cover most of the climatic variations in the country are selected as a case study. A Ventilation Decision Making Model (VDMM), depends on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a multi-criteria analysis technique, is proposed and developed. For feeding data to the VDMM, field measures for indoor air temperature and relative humidity are conducted as well as applying an energy simulation model to predict indoor energy performance in the selected regions. Based on the results of VDMM application on the investigated case study, a decision to KSA construction market is introduced. The results absolutely support using the mechanical system in both Riyadh and Jeddah regions while utilizing the natural system in Abha region is more preferable. The VDMM is characterized by its flexibility, accepting more alternatives or criteria and its validity to be applied to other regions inside or outside KSA.",

Earth-based materials have been studied because of energy efficiency and ecologically sustainability. The chromite deposits, 10% of the world reserves, are processed in Elaz\u0131\u011f Ferrochrome Factory in Eastern of Turkey. Elaz\u0131\u011f Ferrochrome slag (EFS) as a by-product of the factory is produced roughly 50,000 tons in a year. The disposal, removal and storage of this by-product is a serious problem. Therefore, the utilization of this waste material in building applications is very important. The aim of this work is to investigate effects of gypsum and EFS additives on mechanical and physical properties of unfired earth brick (UEB) materials in order to assess their potential advantages in building applications. The earth material was characterized by laboratory tests. Four different UEB samples were produced by using different compositions of earth, gypsum, EFS and straw fibers. Compressive strength, water absorption coefficient, drying shrinkage, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and density of the prepared UEB samples were determined. The experimental findings have showed that the usage of gypsum and EFS in stabilizing process of UEBs was advantageous.",

This paper gives an attempt to analyse the spatial and temporal changes experienced by major activity centres in the Sydney metropolitan area. The objectives of the research were first, to explore the role of main activity centres on the distribution of job opportunity across the metropolitan area, second to find out whether or not these key activity centres were influential in making the Sydney\u2019s urban structure more poly-centric rather than being a mono-centric. It also estimates how accessible these activity centres are for the workforce and what their corresponding labour catchment areas are. Eleven activity centres were chosen based on the preliminary analysis of Sydney\u2019s planning and development documents and exist evidences on living and working spots. A number of analysing techniques such as mapping of journeys to work in these centres, influence circles of centres, employment preference functions, and tabular data on the levels of employment were applied. The results of the analysis show that apart from the CBD, North Sydney, Parramatta and Inner City the remaining activity centres appear to exert slight impact on employment distribution across the metropolitan area. There does not seem to be evidence for a significant polycentric structure in Sydney metropolitan area in regarding with employment recruitment, seeking and retention.",

The main goal consists in determining the elastic modulus (MOE) and the bending strength of rupture (MOR) of wood-concrete panels used in construction. This work was performed using two complementary methods. Through an experimental work, elastic proprieties have been obtained to develop a finite element model for simulating wood-concrete timber panels, tested in three-point bending. For the numerical simulation, an eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) has been used to simulate the fracture process of the three-point bending panel using Abaqus software (Abaqus, 2016). The difficulties in determining the mechanical properties of composite panels using cement as binder are discussed. The test results allow the computation of the moduli of rupture and elasticity. It is also shown that the ratio between flexural and compressive strength is around 47%. Moreover, we present an assessment of the applicability of the XFEM, to predict where and when the fractures of concrete materials containing wood shavings will appear during the bending test. Numerical predictions are compared to experimental data. The methodology applied in this study gives promising results for the better prediction of mechanical properties of composite panels used in building and for further reduction of expensive experimental works.",

Using data obtained from detailed energy audits, several proven energy efficiency measures have been analyzed through optimized based analysis to assess their impact on the energy performance for both new and existing buildings in Qatar. Moreover, a bottom-up analysis approach is considered to quantify the multiple benefits for implementing large-scale building energy efficiency programs for the building stock in Qatar. In particular, a more stringent energy efficiency code for the new constructions and three energy retrofit levels for the existing buildings are considered in the analysis. A novel macro-economic analysis using the concept of energy productivity is used to assess the cost-benefit of large-scale energy efficiency programs in Qatar. It is determined that the implementation of a government funded large-scale energy retrofit program for the existing building stock is highly cost-effective in Qatar. In particular, it is found that a large-scale energy efficiency retrofit program of existing buildings can provide a reduction of 11,000\u202fGWh in annual electricity consumption and 2500\u202fMW in peak demand as well as over 5400\u202fkilo-ton per year in carbon emissions.

On the other hand, plastic waste of vehicle causes serious health and environmental problems all over the world. The reuse of wastes is important from different points of view. It helps to save and sustain resources that are not replenished. As a possible solution to the problem of plastic waste of vehicle, an experimental study was conducted to examine the potential of using it as sand replacement in the concrete buildings. This paper examines ultimate failure resistance of concrete with 5%, 10% and 15% of sand replacements by waste plastic of vehicles under impact. For each amount, six cubes of 100\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f100\u202fmm were subjected to 4.5\u202fkg hammer from 480\u202fmm height. The number of blows of the hammer required to induce the ultimate failure of the cubes were recorded. The results are presented in terms of impact energy required for the ultimate failure. The concrete mixtures exhibited ability to absorb a large amount of impact energy. The plastic waste of vehicle increased the impact energy for the ultimate failure with sand replacement by plastic waste of vehicle.",

     "abstract": "Due to various kinds of obsolescence, a large number of concrete buildings around the world are removed to give space for new buildings, however, the elements of these buildings in most cases have the ability to serve longer time, but the dominant demolition end-of-life scenario prevents from the reuse of these elements. It has been demonstrated that reuse of elements and materials is an environmentally responsible option that turns the current linear model of building materials and elements into a cyclic one, which pushes toward reconsidering the construction design of concrete buildings to support future disassembly, that facilitate reuse and adaptation. This study tends to explore and review the current issues related to concrete technologies and their role in building assembly and disassembly, as well as DfD \u201cdesign for disassembly\u201d aspects and theories that clarify and pave the way for future innovations, which move the construction design of concrete buildings to a higher degree of environmental responsibility. The study found out that despite the continuous developments in the field of concrete technologies, the link of these developments to the end-of-life phase is still missing. The study concluded that it is possible through the application of DfD criteria on precast concrete systems and elements to change the liner life-cycle model to a cyclic one.",

It is an established fact that the manufacturing of one tonne of cement produces about one tonne of CO2, which is a major Green House Gas (GHG), contributing to Global Warming, Climate Change and Ozone layer depletion. In this paper, the environmental impact of cement manufacturing has been assessed on the basis of literature review. The use of Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) such as Pulverized Fly Ash (PFA) and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), Rice Husk Ash (RHA) and Silica Fumes (SF) have been used for reducing the weight of cement in the concrete mixes to achieve, the desired compressive strength of concrete for use in construction projects. Various trial mixes have been used with partial substitution of cement with PFA and GGBFS and SF to achieve the desired high strength concrete for structural uses. The addition of the SCM has reduced the cement proportion in concrete, thereby making it relatively sustainable. The results have been assessed on the basis of reduction in the embodied energy of the concrete.

This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the work of numerous researchers on structure and properties of concrete containing rice husk ash (RHA) as partial replacement of ordinary Portland cement. Some of the findings are: (i) controlled incineration is required to produce RHA with structure that can result in structural concrete, (ii) the use of RHA resulted in increased water demand, (iii) up to 10% cement replacement with RHA will result in strength development comparable to the control specimens, and (iv) the use of RHA in concrete result in impervious RHA-concrete microstructure to agent of degradation like, sulphate attacks, chloride ingress, etc., as well as good shrinkage properties, and thus produce durable concrete when used. However, some areas such as the bending and shear responses (and allied properties) of reinforced concrete slabs and beams with RHA are presently not yet covered by researchers; they are therefore recommended for future investigation.",

     "abstract": "Environment is subject to many pressures. Climate change and the global warming constitute an additional pressure. The \u201cclimate change\u201d and its consequences are more important than other challenges in 21 century. The global temperature has risen by more than 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C in recent years. Similarly, a global temperature rise of more than 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C increases the absolute number of people at risk of hunger by 80 million. Recent estimates indicate that 25% of the world\u2019s mammals and 12% of birds are at significant risk of global extinction. The main reason for global warming is CO2 increase that is obtained from burn reaction. According to California university, CO2 emissions result from emissions of: transportation 49%, electricity 30%, industrial 11%, residential 7% and commercial 3%. In the mean time, CO2 concentration is 360\u00a0ppm even, if severity plan will be applied as per Kyoto protocol it will arrive at 450\u2013650\u00a0ppm in 2100. Thus, there is a global resolution for declining CO2 emission and one of the practical approaches is CO2 decreasing in electricity sector. Each of energies has strengths and weaknesses and we focus more on nuclear energy because its CO2 emission is zero. It should be added, in most of countries there is a tax for gas e.g. in the U.K. 3.4$/gallon and in Italy 2.53 $/gallon, so fossil fuel is an income for their governments but for nuclear energy government pays subsidies. Therefore it is not possible to debate about it before removing tax and subsidy. In recent years, it has been stated about tax on carbon production that it is a step forward to low carbon economy and finding the real cost of fossil fuel with attention to external costs in the environment.",

These prevailing issues will worsen over the coming decades as the urban population is increasing at a phenomenal rate, thus highlighting the urgency to take appropriate actions.Smart development has been identified as a sustainable world-wide solution to the existing urban planning issues, whose principles aims at providing a better quality of life and advertises livable communities; though the concept is vague to define, as no universal definition exists. The soul reason for the concept to be vague is the number of dimensions in which it is represented and therefore, the concept needs to be standardized in order to scale development worldwide.India has undergone rapid urbanization over the last few decades and the witnessing cities are mostly of Class-I & II tiers. To cater the issues developed by this phenomenon, the governing authorities have taken up initiatives over the years, in the form of programmes that have mainly focused on providing basic infrastructure services and utilities to the cities and have not paid much attention in achieving sustainability in the approach. Recently, India has introduced the smart city mission, which is somewhat on the similar lines of smart development. Since the development is been interpreted differently among the nations due to no standardization of the concept, it\u2019s important to understand how the concept has been represented in the Indian context.The paper intended to analyse the concept of smart development and explore the sustainability quotient in the smart city mission introduced by the Government of India. And, concluding that whether the initiative taken up, achieves sustainability in the field of urban planning. To achieve the above-mentioned goals, an in-depth analysis was conducted of the various concepts associated with smart development.",

It is evident from the literature that BIM provides a virtual repository that allows easy access to and sharing of information and knowledge in real time. Thus, BIM provides a platform for professionals to work in an integrated environment at any stage of the building delivery process. However, the maximization of the benefits BIM provides through the virtual repository depends on the contracting method adopted for the building delivery.

     "abstract": "In an industrial climate where the reduction of carbon emissions is paramount to meeting industry standards for a sustainable future, the cement industry is looking for alternative and creative solutions to reducing its carbon footprint and energy consumption. The title review develops a novel process for the production of calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement, a material produced in the Chinese construction industry for use as a rapid hardening binder for 5 decades; but now undergoing rapid change.The novelty of the proposed process lies partly in its source of sulfur. Typically provided by gypsum in conventional raw feeds, the novel process instead sequesters sulfur into the cement solids through the combustion of elemental sulfur. This combustion event, in turn, contributes towards the calorific value required to heat and maintain kiln temperatures by burning fossil fuel, e.g. natural gas. The combustion of sulfur also provides various added benefits. The resultant sulfur-containing atmosphere in the reaction system provides a protective environment which represses S volatilisation at the operating temperatures used for CSA production, ca 1200\u20131300\u202f\u00b0C.The novel process was developed with the intention for eventual commercial production in Doha, Qatar. The combustion of sulfur would be additionally beneficial due to the nation\u2019s production of vast quantities of natural gas; elemental sulfur is a by-product of the Claus process, used for the desulfurisation of natural gas or sour crude. The proposed novel process would thereby utilise a waste product, i.e. sulfur, for the production of a low carbon cement product.",

Having been established that the main driver of change in our Climate is the result of anthropogenic activities which contribute to the global increase in concentration of Green House Gases (GHG), there is therefore need for effective sensitization and public awareness regarding our actions and how they contribute to the issue of Climate Change experienced globally. For this reason an effective framework needs to be designed for this purpose, hence the objective of this research.As an effective model for Public enlightenment should be one that will: enable all stakeholders gain easy access to each other to achieve efficient dissemination of information; take into consideration the geopolitical and socioeconomic nature of the region in concern; be sustainable; flexible and adaptable, this research adopted the Integrative Literature Based Research Methodology by analysing articles of renowned authors and organizations published between 1995 and 2016 to gain supportive ideas that are vital towards the design of an effective model for public enlightenment and participation in resolving Climate Change. A model fulfilling the afore mentioned qualities was designed and reviewed for its practicability and effectiveness.",

     "abstract": "Customer involvement in infrastructure maintenance activities is a complex process due to various decision-making parameters surrounding maintenance. Compared to manufacturing and other disciplines where QFD is widely used, expectations of the infrastructure user as a customer are truly dynamic given the changing economic conditions, technologies, environmental regulations, etc. While such dynamic or changing customer expectations can be addressed by repeated surveys and constant communication, having indicators to predict customer response would be a valuable tool and aid the QFD decision-making process. In this study, a framework that utilizes hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed for evaluating customer expectation by using probabilities of focus areas that are of interest to the infrastructure user as hidden parameters. The focus areas are based on sustainability parameters and include economic, social, technological, maintenance efficiency, safety and environmental conditions. Probabilities that represent the probability of transition from current state (of the focus area) to next possible state were generated based on expert opinion of the authors. Using the 2005 customer survey by California Transportation, a case study is presented in order to demonstrate the application which concludes that the proposed methodology can be successfully implemented for infrastructure maintenance.",

Experiments demonstrate that SF has greater influence on the standard consistency of the OPC\u2013FA\u2013SF\u2013GGBS paste, as compare to FA and GGBs. Water requirement in the paste escalates, with increase in SF percentage level within the paste, owing to the high surface area. In case of GGBS, around 3\u20135% of reduction in water/binder ratio was recorded, whereas for SF, it was 10\u201312%. In quaternary OPC\u2013FA\u2013SF\u2013GGBS pastes, increases in initial and final setting times at 5%, 7.5%, 10%, and 15% replacement of SF and GGBS were observed, whereas OPC\u2013FA\u2013SF\u2013MK paste setting time shows an increase at 5% replacement of SF and MK with 20% and 70% replacement of FA and OPC, however, it starts decreasing between 7.5% and 15% replacement of SF and MK. The consistency of the quaternary binders increases with an increase in percentage of SF and MK. In general the effect of FA, SF, GGBS and MK reflects in the behavior of quaternary binders even though the performance of all three pozzolans behaves completely independent of each other.",

     "abstract": "Million tons of waste glass is being generated annually all over the world. Once the glass becomes a waste it is disposed as landfills, which is unsustainable as this does not decompose in the environment. Glass is principally composed of silica. Use of milled (ground) waste glass in concrete as partial replacement of cement could be an important step toward development of sustainable (environmentally friendly, energy-efficient and economical) infrastructure systems. When waste glass is milled down to micro size particles, it is expected to undergo pozzolanic reactions with cement hydrates, forming secondary Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C\u2013S\u2013H). In this research chemical properties of both clear and colored glass were evaluated. Chemical analysis of glass and cement samples was determined using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique and found minor differences in composition between clear and colored glasses. Flow and compressive strength tests on mortar and concrete were carried out by adding 0\u201325% ground glass in which water to binder (cement\u00a0+\u00a0glass) ratio is kept the same for all replacement levels. With increase in glass addition mortar flow was slightly increased while a minor effect on concrete workability was noted. To evaluate the packing and pozzolanic effects, further tests were also conducted with same mix details and 1% super plasticizing admixture dose (by weight of cement) and generally found an increase in compressive strength of mortars with admixture. As with mortar, concrete cube samples were prepared and tested for strength (until 1\u00a0year curing). The compressive strength test results indicated that recycled glass mortar and concrete gave better strength compared to control samples. A 20% replacement of cement with waste glass was found convincing considering cost and the environment.",

Experimental set up considered using a greenhouse pilot prototype placed into the municipal landfill of Puebla city, M\u00e9xico. The greenhouse was built with a basement surface enough to place 9 trays with leachate. Treatment follow up was done through the following parameters: air temperature inside and outside the greenhouse; leachate temperature at surface and middle liquid height. Results of the first set of experiments defined a minimal initial liquid height of 20% in respect to the tray height; the 2nd set allowed defining optimal evaporation rate conditions evaluated in respect of a tray placed outside, considered as reference of 100% efficiency (blank), obtained results showed that morning and night processes provided efficiencies up to 2 times the reference; otherwise, afternoon measurements showed similar temperature values inside and outside. In general collected data at winter season provided efficiencies between 82% and 147%, in periods of 24\u00a0h, it was observed that higher liquid reductions took place at North, and lower ones at the South positions. Based on these results it was proposed a 20\u00a0days experiment, using stagnant (E) and recharge (R) conditions referred to the blank (L), the R process showed greater efficiency (168%) than the stagnant one (158%). Leachate chemical characterization indicates that pH is highly stable; while total solids, chemical oxygen demand, sulfate and chloride exhibit an increase in concentration reaching values of 1.2\u20132.5\u00a0times the initial concentration, phosphate was the only parameter exhibiting a decreasing trend ending with 40% of its initial concentration.",

A typical small-scale facility provides a case study that contextualises these factors, captures their interdependencies, and explores the viability and sustainability of small hospitals. The findings from the work suggest that small facilities can be viable and more comprehensive research that provides a balanced view of economies of scale is required to support future healthcare design policies, where large and more specialised hospitals may no longer be environmentally, technologically, socially and economically sustainable.",

The study uses crisp set qualitative comparative analysis (csQCA) method for exploring the causal combinations of different BIM capabilities and asserts that causal combinations of four BIM capabilities: MEP system modelling, energy and environment analysis, constructability analysis and structural analysis, when implemented on construction projects can lead to lean and green outcomes. With the help of sixteen cases it is shown that adoption of BIM leads to improved project outcomes especially ones targeting lean and green aspects.",

The results of tests under compression and tensile stress showed that mix 1% plastic fiber (PF) gave the best results when compared to reference mix without PF. Eggshell (rich with CaO) and glass wastes (rich of silca) were crashed and powdered to desired size and used as partial replacement of cement with these percentage: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%. Compressive strength, flexural strength, density, absorption and modulus of elasticity were tested. Comparison was made with reference mix (without waste powder) to figure the efficiency of using these waste in lightweight Porcelanite concrete. The results of tests showed that mixes with 1% PF and 5% eggshell powder (ESP) gave results so close to reference mix. Using more than 5% ESP made no improvement in lightweight concrete, while the mix with 1% PF with any glass powder (GP) percentages used in this research gave good improvement in the tested properties especially at 20% GP.",

     "abstract": "Urban blight had its own rational and hierarchical function in the past. Nowadays it is featured with structural and functional shortage. Therefore, it has lost the capacity to meet the residents\u2019 needs. Along with intensification of urban blight problems in cities, and downtowns in particular, which affects different aspects of urban life, many urban planners have shown special attention to such districts. Laleh-Zar neighborhood is an example of these neighborhoods, which on the one hand due to lack of urban equipment and infrastructures gives rise to urban blight and penetration of commercial and trans-regional land use in residential area. On the other hand, much of its residential units are transformed into business units, warehouses, workhouse particularly on the edge of the neighborhood. Given the expansion and intensity of problems, apparently, the most effective strategy to deal with the shortcomings and the problems is participation strategy. Besides, this study has used a strategic approach, which is one of the public plannings for both internal and external analyses. Therefore, it is a systematic approach, which can be helpful in decision making. The results showed that the capacity for participation of the study population was below proper level concerning the four aspects of financial, intellectual, instrumental, and physical aspects, although their tendency to participate was high.

Many environment friendly prefabricated elements are entering into the market at an increasing pace. This has increased the workload and inquisitiveness of the stakeholders who will need information about their environmental, technical and esthetic aspects. The use of prefabrication in sustainable construction is advantageous but appropriate decision criteria and their weightage for applicability assessments for a project from every stakeholder\u2019s perspective is found to be deficient. Decisions to use prefabricated elements are still largely based on anecdotal evidence or cost-based evaluation rather than holistic sustainable performance. But authenticated information is seldom available and suitability within the project requirements is always debatable. Environmental decisions, being closely coupled with society\u2019s built-in uncertainties and risks, are uncertain since ecological systems as well as social systems change in the future. Thus the selection of a suitable construction method has been perceived as a multi-criteria decision-making problem highly intensive in knowledge with partial information and uncertainty. This knowledge or perception base from the minds of experts has to be collected and processed for a decision. Fuzzy synthetic evaluation method using analytic hierarchy process by Saaty has been adopted to provide an analytical tool to evaluate the applicability of prefabricated or on-site construction method.",

This paper intends to analyze the impact of different parking pressure characteristics in the estimation of local accessibility. Short trips to pharmacies, groceries, bakeries and primary schools were analyzed and a comparison of accessibility indicators for walking and car was made, considering four different parking scenarios. The methodology was applied to two different neighborhoods in the city of Lisbon, with significant differences in their urban planning and mobility patterns.The results obtained show that, for a neighborhood with high walking accessibility, only a low parking pressure scenario would have better indicators when compared to the walking mode. The increase in 5\u00a0min in the time for the search for a parking place represents a decrease in the accessibility indicators in more than 20% and an elimination of the parking searching time plus a reduction of the distance to destination up to 25\u00a0m can increase accessibility up to 47%.However, in areas more car-oriented, parking management can lead to significant reductions in car attractiveness. Only a high or very high pressure parking scenario would be less attractive than the walking mode. The parking policies could lead to a decrease in 80% of the car accessibility. Yet, this kind of measure would not represent a better overall accessibility to the neighborhood, contributing, however to a lower use of the motorized modes.",

In Cameroon, the energy consumption demand in the buildings sector has been rapidly increasing in recent years; so well that energy supply does not always satisfy demand. Thermal insulation technology can be one of the leading methods for reducing energy consumption in these new buildings. However, choosing the thickness of the insulation material often causes high insulation costs. In the present study, the optimum insulation thickness, energy saving and payback period were calculated for buildings in Yaound\u00e9 and Garoua cities, located in two climatic regions in Cameroon. The economic model including the cost of insulation material and the present value of energy consumption and the cost over a life time of 22\u00a0years of the building, were used to find the optimum insulation thickness, energy saving, and payback period. Materials that extruded polystyrene were chosen and used for two typical wall structures (concrete block (HCB) and compressed stabilized earth block wall (CSEB)). The early cooling transmission loads, according to wall orientations and percentage of radiation blocked were calculated using the explicit finite-difference method under steady periodic conditions. As a result, it was found that the west- and east-facing walls are the least favourite in the cooling season, whereas the south and north orientations are the most economical. Although wall orientation had a significant effect on the optimum insulation thickness, it had a more significant effect on energy savings. In equatorial region (Yaound\u00e9), for south orientation, the optimum insulation thickness was 0.08\u00a0m for an energy savings of 51.69\u00a0$/m2. Meanwhile, in tropical region (Garoua), for north orientation, the optimum insulation thickness was 0.11\u00a0m for an energy savings of 97.82\u00a0$/m2.",

     "abstract": "The worldwide demand for new concrete buildings is increasing at a rapid pace to keep up with urban development. Despite the need, concrete production and its use have a number of environmental consequences. The production of concrete creates a substantial need for water that directly causes a burden on the already scare natural resource. In United Arab Emirates the majority of the water used for concrete production is obtained through desalination of the seawater. Desalination of seawater produces highly saline wastewater commonly known as reject brine or concentrated brine that has numerous negative environmental effects. The production of cement, the primary ingredient in the production of concrete is responsible for the generation of nearly 5% of the global carbon dioxide that is a potent greenhouse gas.With the intent of reducing the carbon footprint of concrete production, a study was carried out to determine the effect of using reject brine as the source of water and the use of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) as a replacement for cement. Concrete samples having three different cement contents were prepared with normal tap water and reject brine. Results showed that the use of GGBS and reject brine improved the strength of concrete produced by 16.5%. Replacing 50% of the cement with GGBS and using reject brine as the source of water has a potential for reducing 176\u00a0kg CO2 and 1.7\u20133.4\u00a0kg of CO2 equivalents per one cubic meter of concrete, respectively. The use of the waste reject brine can potentially save USD 170\u2013340 per cubic meter of concrete produced.",

Building regulations are mostly specified for various uses and apply to the particular size of a plot in India, generally, irrespective of the shape and topography of the plot. As a result, often while complying with the provisions of one regulation will lead to noncompliance of provisions of other regulations. This further aggravates the problems of noncompliance with the existing building regulations and often results in unauthorized development and enormous environmental impacts. An attempt is made to understand different issues associated with building regulations of Shimla. Further, the effects of plot proportions on the compliance of building regulations are also studied in the case of Shimla, being the largest hilltop town of northern India on ecologically sensitive topography.",

However, there is evidence to show that social housing is not adequately supported to achieve sustainable goals despite its significance for addressing the housing crisis. The aim of this study is to determine the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for achieving Sustainable Social Housing (SSH) from economic, environmental and social perspectives for meeting housing needs. The document content analysis approach involving relevant literature resources was used for generating the success factors (SFs) for achieving SSH. Findings from this approach were refined before using them in preparing a questionnaire used to gather data from housing authorities (public) and private non-profit social housing organisations in England and they were asked to rank the criticality level of the identified success factors. The data gathered through the relevant documents and respondents were analysed respectively with NVivo and Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Findings revealed some of the CSFs for achieving SSH for meeting housing needs as: adequate funding and provision, affordability, efficient economic planning, appropriate construction technology, environmental protection, use of environmental friendly materials, effective land use planning, appropriate design, security of lives and property, provision of social services and ensuring social cohesion. The paper recommends the use of efficient sustainable development (SD) strategies and legal and institutional frameworks for monitoring and evaluating the delivery of SSH. The Government must embark on effective housing programmes for ensuring adequate provision of social housing that is sustainable for meeting housing needs in the short and long-run. There is need for the Government to regularly provide financial supports to social housing providers and users for addressing the housing crisis.",

To understand how BIM could be employed for DfD and to identify essential functionalities for a BIM-based deconstruction tool, Focus Group Interviews (FGIs) were conducted with professionals who have utilised BIM on their projects. The interview transcripts of the FGIs were analysed using descriptive interpretive analysis to identify common themes based on the experiences of the participants. The themes highlight functionalities of BIM in driving effective DfD process, which include improved collaboration among stakeholders, visualisation of deconstruction process, identification of recoverable materials, deconstruction plan development, performance analysis and simulation of end-of-life alternatives, improved building lifecycle management, and interoperability with existing BIM software.

This paper investigates how the operational strategies of facilities management can contribute to reducing building energy use. A longitudinal case study of a higher education (HE) campus which was conceptualised with the objective of being environmentally friendly and energy efficient is presented. The paper reflects on the energy performance of the campus since its operation in 2001, based on 14\u00a0years of energy data and a detailed record of all initiatives undertaken by the campus\u2019s facilities management (FM) team in order to optimise energy performance. The integrated FM strategy composed of low- and no-cost strategies, continuous improvements, ongoing commissioning and retrofits succeeded in reducing campus energy intensity from 174 to 87\u00a0kWh/(m2*yr), now outperforming most relevant benchmarks. This finding highlights the importance of operations and maintenance in reducing the energy usage of existing buildings. This presented findings draw on a single case only, which excels through a very detailed longitudinal dataset. Going forwards, the analysis of further cases is recommended to corroborate the findings. The presented results suggest that proactive operations and maintenance strategies in existing buildings can contribute towards significantly improving energy performance. The profile and competency level of facilities management personnel should consequently be raised strategically at the organisational and national/industrial policy level, whilst integrated design processes should be further expanded to include FM\u2019s operational control and management in a holistically fashion.",

The energy consumption of all processes during mining to material production, transportation, construction plant and tools, and operation (heating, cooling, lighting, hot water and home appliances) stages causes high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and embodied energy (EE) consumption. The literature review to date have confirmed that the building envelope consisting of exterior walls, windows, external doors, roof, and floor could significantly affect the energy consumption during operation stage. Australian construction industry could thus enhance the energy efficiency of the building envelope in order to achieve its GHG emissions reduction targets. This paper has assessed the GHG emissions and EE consumption associated with the construction and use of a typical house in Perth for sixty building envelope options using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The results show that the building envelope consisting of cast in situ sandwich wall with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam core, double glazed windows, and concrete roof tiles has the lowest life cycle GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption.",

     "abstract": "Assessments of ecosystem services (ES) are vital for Africa\u2019s sustainability. ES supply and demand take place in distinctive patterns in Africa due to the continent\u2019s characteristic spatial heterogeneity, rich biodiversity, demographic developments, resource endowment, resource management conflicts, and fragile political landscapes, along with current industrialization and urbanization processes. Ignorance of the dynamism of these parameters could diminish the capacity of the different ecosystem service providing units (SPU) to satisfy the demands in the ecosystem service benefiting areas (SBA) in Africa. The main aim of this review article is to assess the extent to which ES studies have been conducted and applied in Africa. This review analyzes those articles accessible online via the ISI Web of Science and open access journals. The online search yielded 52 ES-related studies, which were used for the review. Results indicate that most studies were conducted in South Africa, Kenya and Tanzania, and focused on services provided by watersheds and catchment ecosystems. Crucially, most of the studies focused on more than one ES category. Provisioning ES dominated across all the ES categories. However, ES tradeoffs and synergies were barely addressed. Economic valuation of ES and ES mapping comprised more than three-quarters of all the studies, and a quarter referred to biophysical quantification or qualification of ES. There are emerging alternative, non-monetary valuation methods for ES, which could pave a new way of capturing value of non-monetized ES in Africa. Moreover, there is an urgent need to extend ES studies to the entire continent, in order to capture spatial and socio-economic uniqueness of various countries and focus more on local-scale assessments of multiple ES, as a means for addressing ES tradeoffs, synergies and SPU-SBA relations in Africa.",

A particular great energy saving potential is present in the Danish single-family houses erected in 1960\u20131979, but the potential is not utilized for various reasons. However, survey results show that improvements in comfort, indoor environment and architecture combined with a reasonable project economy can motivate the average homeowner of these buildings. The objective of this paper is to further process the survey data from 883 homeowners and determine if all homeowners can be assumed as one homogeneous group in terms of motivation factors or if significant differences occur, what causes the differences and how does this affect the future motivation strategy.The conclusion is that the homeowners cannot be assumed as one group, but must be addressed as individuals. The key parameters for determining the motivation factors are related to the homeowner\u2019s current position in life: age, presence and age of children, time of ownership, occupation and income. Most likely to be motivated to perform energy renovation is the younger generation of homeowners The older generation is hard to motivate, but results nonetheless show that it is possible with the right instruments.",

     "abstract": "Water and energy are two inseparable commodities that govern the lives of humanity and promote civilization. Energy can be used to produce water in case of scarcity in water. Ironically most of the places that are water stressed are also energy stressed. The cost of extending grid power may be prohibitively high in those cases. Rural/remote locations like hills and islands multiply the problem to a larger magnitude. Use of renewable sources like solar, wind, biomass and other locally available energy sources is the only solution. But these renewable sources are of intermittent nature and have poor availability. Hence, it is practically difficult to produce water with a single source of energy. Naturally, combining two or more sources of energy, known as hybrid power system, is the next available option. This paper carries out a techno-economic analysis of various sizing combinations of systems with solar photo voltaic, wind energy and stored energy in batteries for production of drinking water from a brackish water source. The system can operate the RO plant whenever the power is available, produce drinking water and store in a tank. This paper analyses the model of the entire hybrid power system in MATLAB to simulate the performance of the hybrid power system for different combinations of capacities. Results of the analysis under various input conditions are analyzed.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents mechanical and durability properties of geopolymer concrete containing recycled coarse aggregate (RCA). The RCA is sourced from local construction and demolition (C&D) waste in Perth, Australia. The RCA is used as a partial replacement of natural coarse aggregate (NCA) in geopolymer concrete at 15%, 30% and 50% by wt. which corresponds to series two, three and four, respectively, while the geopolymer concrete containing 100% NCA is control and is considered as the first series. Class F fly ash is used as the source material for the geopolymer and 8\u00a0M sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate alkali activators are used to synthesise the fly ash geopolymer in this study. In all four series a constant alkali activator to fly ash ratio is used. Compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and elastic modulus of above geopolymer concrete are measured at 7 and 28\u00a0days, while sorptivity, immersed water absorption and volume of permeable voids of above geopolymer concrete are measured at 28\u00a0days. Relevant Australian standards are used to measure all the above properties except the sorptivity which is measured according to ASTM standard. Results show that the compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and elastic modulus of geopolymer concrete decrease with an increase in RCA contents, which is also true for both 7 and 28\u00a0days. Excellent correlations of compressive strength with indirect tensile strength and elastic modulus are also observed in geopolymer concrete containing RCA. Existing empirical models for cement concrete and geopolymer concrete containing NCA underestimate and overestimate the indirect tensile strength and elastic modulus, respectively of geopolymer concrete containing RCA. The measured durability properties such as sorptivity, water absorption and volume of permeable voids of geopolymer concrete were also adversely affected by the incorporation of RCA and these properties increase with an increase in RCA contents. The effects of RCA on the measured mechanical and durability properties of geopolymer concrete follow similar trend in cement concrete. Very good correlations of compressive strength with volume of permeable voids and water absorption of geopolymer concrete containing RCA are also observed, while the correlation between the compressive strength and the sorptivity is not that strong.",

     "abstract": "High demand of natural resources due to rapid urbanization and the disposal problem of agricultural wastes in developed countries have created opportunities for use of agro-waste in the construction industry. Many agricultural waste materials are already used in concrete as replacement alternatives for cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate and reinforcing materials. This paper reviews some of the agro-waste materials, which are used as a partial replacement of fine aggregate in concrete. Different properties of fresh and hardened concrete, their durability and thermal conductivity when admixed with agro-wastes are reviewed. Agro-waste used in self-compacting concrete and mortar are also reviewed and their properties are compared. It has been seen that the agro-waste concrete containing groundnut shell, oyster shell, cork, rice husk ash and tobacco waste showed better workability than their counterparts did. Agro-waste concrete containing bagasse ash, sawdust ash and oyster shell achieved their required strength by 20% of replacement as fine aggregate, which were maximum among all agro-waste type concrete. Close relations were predicted among compressive strength, flexural strength, tensile strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity and elastic modulus of agro-waste concrete. Addition of bagasse ash as fine aggregate in mortar increased the resistance of chloride penetration whereas inclusion of cork in mortar showed better thermal resistance and improved cyclic performance. After the review, it is of considerable finding that more research is deserved on all fine aggregates replacing agro-waste materials, which can give more certainty on their utilization in concrete.",

As the residential sector consumes around 42.3% of the total energy used in Egypt, one of the main factors that waste that energy is artificial lighting and electric ventilation. Meanwhile, the architects who design those building never pay the enough attention to the energy in the design process. This paper tackles many strategies for the environmental control of building designs besides showing that now, it is essential to take into consideration energy performance efficiency and the compatibility of the building with the environment by optimizing the design of the building envelope elements such as a window to wall ratio (WWR), the glazing type. This paper will not cover the details of construction and structure, but it sheds light on many guidelines to help to raise the thermal and environmental quality of the envelope of the building. A computer-based simulation tool (Autodesk Ecotect) was used to measure current building energy and lighting performance in one of the modern cities like Madenaty city. By the end of this study, some of the characteristics of the building envelope will be concluded like the window wall ratio in the aim to reduce the energy waste in the case study, as well as the different criteria of designing process for residential buildings in Egypt in the near future.",

This study evaluated strength, plastic shrinkage and permeability (gas and water) of concrete incorporating \u2018polypropylene\u2019 fiber (aspect ratio 300) in various proportions (viz. 0.10%, 0.15%, 0.2%, 0.25% and 0.3%) by volume of concrete. Plane concrete samples were also prepared and tested for reference purpose. Inclusion of 0.1% fiber gave minor reduction (2%) in compressive strength while the tensile strength increased by 39% with same fiber content compared to the plain concrete. A significant reduction in crack generation, appearance period of first crack and crack area between plane concrete and fiber reinforced concretes was found. The experimental result with inclusion of 0.1\u20130.3% fiber in concrete indicated that plastic shrinkage cracks were reduced by 50\u201399% compared to the plain concrete. For reference concrete (without fiber), test within the high temperature and controlled humidity chamber gave higher crack width than the acceptable limit (3\u00a0mm) specified by the ACI 224. With the inclusion of 0.1% fiber reduced the crack width down to 1\u00a0mm and the trend was continued with the addition of more fibers. However, results showed that with the addition of polypropylene fiber both water and gas permeability coefficient was increased. Therefore, it is concluded that the fiber reinforced concrete would work better for plastic shrinkage susceptible structural elements (flat elements such as slab); however, it requires careful judgement while applying to a water retaining structures.",

     "abstract": "Compressive strength of concrete, recognized as one of the most significant mechanical properties of concrete, is identified as one of the most essential factors for the quality assurance of concrete. In the current study, three different data-driven models, i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used to predict the 28\u00a0days compressive strength of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). Recycled aggregate is the current need of the hour owing to its environmental pleasant aspect of re-using the wastes due to construction. 14 different input parameters, including both dimensional and non-dimensional parameters, were used in this study for predicting the 28\u00a0days compressive strength of concrete. The present study concluded that estimation of 28\u00a0days compressive strength of recycled aggregate concrete was performed better by ANN and ANFIS in comparison to MLR. In other words, comparing the test step of all the three models, it can be concluded that the MLR model is better to be utilized for preliminary mix design of concrete, and ANN and ANFIS models are suggested to be used in the mix design optimization and in the case of higher accuracy necessities. In addition, the performance of data-driven models with and without the non-dimensional parameters is explored. It was observed that the data-driven models show better accuracy when the non-dimensional parameters were used as additional input parameters. Furthermore, the effect of each non-dimensional parameter on the performance of each data-driven model is investigated. Finally, the effect of number of input parameters on 28\u00a0days compressive strength of concrete is examined.",

     "abstract": "Rapid growing of energy use has raised critical concerns over energy supply difficulties and negative environmental impacts globally and among ASEAN countries. Malaysia is experiencing a high average annual energy demand growth rate of approximately 2.3% which large portion of that energy is used by office buildings. Under the hot-humid climatic conditions in Malaysia, high-rise office buildings with large or fully glazed fa\u00e7ades are facing a major problem of overheating due to high solar radiation through the glazed fa\u00e7ades. This has caused high cooling energy requirements. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of three types of shading devices on cooling energy savings when applied at different fa\u00e7ade orientations. The aim also extends to investigations on different cooling energy savings when shading devices are applied on fa\u00e7ade glazing with different configurations and thermal performances. This was done through a case study of a high-rise office building in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia using IES (VE) building thermal simulation software. Twenty simulation building models were applied with different shading devices at different fa\u00e7ade orientations and with high and low performance fa\u00e7ade glazing. The simulation results indicate that high-rise office buildings in Malaysia use approximately 45.9% of total building energy for cooling purposes. The results also suggest that use of various shading devices on low-e double glazed fa\u00e7ades will result between 1.0% and 3.4% annual cooling energy savings, depending on the types of shading devices and fa\u00e7ade orientations. The estimated annual cooling energy savings increase to between 5.0% and 9.9% when the shading devices are applied to all orientations of low-e double glazed fa\u00e7ades. The estimated annual cooling energy savings further increase to between 5.6% and 10.4% when the fa\u00e7ade glazing is replaced by single clear glazing. This study recommends prioritizing shading devices on the East and West fa\u00e7ades for optimized annual cooling energy savings. The simulation results show that egg-crate shadings are able to produce the highest annual cooling energy savings compared to vertical shadings and horizontal shadings. It is recommended to use shading devices on low performance glazing compared to high performance glazing since the energy savings are more significant when shading devices are used on low performance glazing. In conclusion, the use of shading devices is more effective in achieving cooling energy savings compared to the use of high performance glazing under the hot-humid climate of Malaysia.",

The primary objective of this study is to examine floral diversity of the OUSL premises that was rehabilitated from a landfill site and to determine suitable trees for landfill sites based on growth performance and biomass carbon stocks. The girth and height of plants \u2a7e5\u00a0cm\u00a0dbh were measured to estimate biomass carbon stocks of each individual tree. GPS coordinates of each individual tree were taken for spatial mapping. Urban green spaces were extracted from Satellite view of Google Earth for a decade using screen digitizing techniques. A total of 722 individuals, comprising 95 plant species belonging to 75 genera and 33 families, were recorded. Of the total species 45% were native species. The above-ground and below-ground biomass were estimated to be 50\u00a0(t\u00a0C/ha) and 10\u00a0(t\u00a0C/ha) respectively. These results are comparable with above-ground biomass and below-ground biomass in the dry zone forest (60 and 17\u00a0(t\u00a0C/ha) respectively). The study recognized that Terminalia catappa, Filicium decipiens, Mangifera indica, Cassia bacillaris and Tabebuia rosea species grow well in such landfill with effective carbon accumulation, and the species list presented in this paper will provide useful information that will help city planners to maximize biomass carbon sequestration by choosing optimal plants for landscaping in landfill sites.",

     "abstract": "It is predicted that the major increase in energy consumption and, thus, carbon emissions, will happen in the developing world. However, in most developing countries the knowledge about energy efficiency, particularly in the building sector, is quite low. Strategies developed for industrialised countries might not be suitable or must be adapted for the very different context of developing countries. This research aims to find energy-efficient and cost-effective building design options for the case of Nepal. Energy-efficient building design is a non-trivial issue involving a number of interdependent design criteria. Particularly, in composite climates, passive design strategies might conflict each other leading to an inefficient building design. This paper explores the energy conservation potential in hotel design for all bioclimatic zones of Nepal using building energy simulation with parametric analysis. Based on extensive field studies, reference models for typical hotel buildings ranging from small-scale resort hotels to large-scale multi-storey hotels were developed. These reference designs were optimised by varying design parameters such as window-to-wall ratio, glazing material, shading devices, glazing type and insulation levels. During the design optimisation, energy demand as well as cost effectiveness were evaluated. Finally, recommendations for energy-efficient and cost-effective hotel design solutions were suggested. In addition, the bioclimatic zoning for Nepal was consolidated leading to five elevation-based zones that can be used to introduce building energy regulations in the future.",

The objective of this paper is to develop a social sustainable framework and a composite index which is tailor-made to assess the Indian cities. Since social sustainability cannot be developed in isolation this paper examines urban sustainability in an integrated manner with its four dimensions of social, economic, environmental and institutional and maps the criteria at three levels i.e. policy, theoretical, and practical levels. The three tiered hierarchical model is tested in the state of Odisha where the social sustainability can be put to test in the best context as the urbanisation is growing at a stupendous speed and the infrastructure growth does not match up. Using the framework it is possible to obtain a composite index for Urban Social Sustainability whose model can be applied to all Indian cities with contextual changes. The dimensional index score and thematic index score obtained from the model helps in benchmarking the cities and identifying gaps so that it can inform national policy and planning. The social sustainability index together with the indices on the other three dimensions would help in making well informed judgement in the allocation of resources.",

This article sets out how differing sizes, forms and dimensional ratios of central courts in two climate zones of Iran (Yazd, hot and dry, and Bushehr, hot and humid) can support this behaviour. In both places these central court forms can provide good situations for human comfort on various sides and levels of the court. Consequently, residents could move within the house with the seasons to get their desired level of thermal comfort but these traditional patterns of movement differ for each climate zone.",

There are a number of industrial wastes used as fully or partial replacement of coarse aggregate or fine aggregate. This review carries out a thorough assessment about industrial waste substances, which can be adequately utilised in concrete as fine aggregate substitution. This paper reviewed some of these industrial wastes like waste foundry sand, steel slag, copper slag, imperial smelting furnace slag (ISF slag), blast furnace slag, coal bottom ash, ferrochrome slag, palm oil clinker etc. Out of these materials, maximum number of experiments have been conducted using waste foundry sand and copper slag as fine aggregate replacement, but still more examinations are required for other waste materials as replacement of sand in concrete. Different physical and mechanical properties of industrial waste as well as of industrial waste concrete, in which natural sand is substituted have been reviewed and comparisons are made between them. Deflection and leaching study review are carried out additionally and compared. It can be observed that the concrete where sand is replaced by copper slag, imperial smelting furnace slag, class F fly ash exhibits improved strength and durability properties, but it\u2019s slump increases as the rate of replacement increases in the case of copper slag and the slump decreases in the case of class F fly ash. There is a less research work reported on ferrochrome slag and palm oil clinker used as sand substitution, so it is felt that further detailed investigations are required.",

Compressive strength, flexural strength and the effect of high temperature on these properties were the focus of the current study in order to prove the efficiency of adding fine sand to improve adhesive properties and reduce cost. Based on the compressive and flexural tests, results indicated that the addition of sand to the adhesive improved its mechanical properties when sand is 50% of the total weight of the adhesive. However, its effect on the modulus of elasticity is minimal. Using adhesive with fine sand increased the ultimate load bearing capacity, ductility, stiffness and toughness of the reinforced concrete beams strengthened by CFRP. The ratio of the fine sand to the adhesive equal to 1 is considered the best in terms of the cost reduction, maintaining workability, as well as maintaining the mechanical properties. Lastly, the use of fine sand with adhesive ensured a significant reduction in the cost of the adhesive and increased the adhesive resistance to temperature.",

     "abstract": "Governments occupy a significant proportion of building stock and their associated annual water and energy costs can be substantive. Research has shown that significant reductions in energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions can be achieved through retrofitting public buildings. However, in most countries the current retrofitting rate is very low due to a number of barriers, including a lack of supportive legislation, regulations, guidelines, industry capacity and financial mechanisms. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the barriers as well as the best international practices covering numerous aspects of public building retrofits. Among others, the most important barriers identified were a lack of consideration of the water-energy nexus, and the limited availability of effective financing mechanisms. With a particular focus on the Australian context, a strategic roadmap, as well as a number of recommendations, such as the use of revolving loan fund financing and energy performance procurement, have been developed that aim to foster a greater rate of implementation of energy and water retrofit projects for public buildings. Achievement of such an aim will not only reduce ongoing operational costs of public buildings, but also lower their environmental impact and generate new employment opportunities.",

The findings are that the facility is in a moribund state as a result of which it has been unable for years now to serve the purpose for which it was established, that the mission-focused nature of FM service delivery has the potential to enhance its functionality as a centre for events and expositions as well as optimize its value as an investment property thereby serving to sustain this important component of Nigeria\u2019s built heritage.",

A \u201csustainable\u201d transportation infrastructure implies that all the sustainability objectives (i.e., mobility, safety, resource efficiency, economy, ecological protection, environmental quality) are adequately met during the infrastructure life cycle. State-of-the-art sustainability rating tools contain the best practices for the sustainability assessment of infrastructure projects. Generally, the existing rating tools are not well equipped to handle uncertainties associated with data limitations and expert opinion and cannot effectively adapt to site specific constraints for reliable sustainability assessment. This paper presents the development of a customizable tool, called \u201cGreen Proforma\u201d for the sustainability assessment of roadway projects under uncertainties. For evaluating how well the project meets sustainability objectives, a hierarchical framework is used to develop the sustainability objective indices by aggregating the selected indicators with the help of fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique. These indices are further aggregated to attain an overall sustainability index for a roadway project. To facilitate the decision makers, a \u201cRoadway Project Sustainometer\u201d has been developed to illustrate how well the roadway project is meeting its sustainability objectives. By linking the sustainability objectives to measurable indicators, the \u201cGreen Proforma\u201d paves the way for a practical approach in sustainable planning and management of roadway projects.",

Though homeowners typically depend on energy practitioners for HER advice, previous work by the researchers has identified the inadequateness of such information as a barrier. Using an earlier developed information model, an energy retrofit intelligent decision support system (ERIDSS), that integrates expert knowledge with quantitative information to provide homeowners with accurate information for decision-making, was developed. This paper identifies the key components of the proposed ERIDSS, develops rules for relevant energy retrofit expert knowledge to be employed in the knowledge-based system of the proposed ERIDSS, develops the ERIDSS for decision-making for home energy retrofits, and demonstrates the application of the ERIDSS using a pilot system on two test homes. The quantitative information was obtained from published sources and the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s cost database, and the expert knowledge was obtained through the application of the modified Delphi technique and job shadowing of energy auditors and retrofit contractors. The research contributes to improving the adoption of energy retrofits by homeowners, assisting industry practitioners with the corroboration of knowledge/information they provide to homeowners in order to reduce homeowner bias, providing a good understanding of available implicit domain knowledge through the development of six knowledge-based modules, and the development of a system and approach that may be replicated in other domains.",

     "abstract": "Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and its effect on occupant well-being and comfort is an important area of study. This paper presents a state of the art study through extensive review of the literature, by establishing links between IEQs and occupant well-being and comfort. A range of issues such as sick building syndrome, indoor air quality thermal comfort, visual comfort and acoustic comfort are considered in this paper. The complexity of the relationship between occupant comfort and well-being parameters with IEQ are further exacerbated due to relationships that these parameters have with each other as well. Based on the review of literature in these areas it is established that design of buildings needs to consider occupant well-being parameters right at the beginning. Some good practices in all these different areas have also been highlighted and documented in this paper. The knowledge established as part of this paper would be helpful for researchers, designer, engineers and facilities maintenance engineers. This paper will also be of great benefit to researchers who endeavour to undertake research in this area and could act as a good starting point for them.",

     "abstract": "In this paper we focus on crucial issues concerning the effectiveness of evaluation of sustainability in the built environment. The paper argues that we need to rethink the evaluation of urban-building sustainability from an integrative perspective. It advances a theoretical and methodological model based on the regenerative approach, which opens up a new way to deal with the sustainability of the built environment. An enlarged definition of urban metabolism is used to carry out the integrated evaluation.Central in it is the concept of reliability, which expresses the ability of products and processes in the built environment to be adaptive, resilient and regenerative. We use reliability in a transversal manner through the process of making the built environment sustainable, referring it both to buildings and the regenerative process triggered by sustainable actions addressed to buildings. Holistic indicators allow assessing it quantitatively or qualitatively.Through reliability we bring regenerative thinking from a theoretical to an operational level. When referred to buildings, reliability allows considering sustainable performances not usually assessed in current evaluations. When referred to processes, it helps to understand directions of change in relation to sustainability of the built environment. Our method can be easily associated to current evaluation systems exceeding their boundaries.",

     "abstract": "The plurality of life-cycle assessments for concrete pavements have used national or regional data to develop models to aid in decision related processes for designing concrete pavements. The findings of these studies effectively yield information in which global decisions can be made with respect to material selection and implementation. However, construction projects are dependent upon local supply and demand and require different levels of design complexity: freeze\u2013thaw exposure, leaching potential, and alkali-silica reactivity. This paper presents a cradle-to-gate framework for design engineers and concrete ready-mix producers to implement in an effort to optimize mixture designs across economic, environmental, and mechanical performance criteria. The framework was assessed through the examination of a newly constructed highway in South Georgia. The case study proved that through the incorporation of 20% more Class F fly ash compared to the in-situ mixture design used on the pavement project site, all fresh and hardened concrete properties set by the Georgia Department of Transportation could still be exceeded, while the environmental efficiency would also increase by 23% with a total cost savings of 0.67\u00a0million dollars for the 11.52 linear miles (18.54 linear km) of pavement. Additionally, updated emission factors for input materials into concrete pavements, ranging from cement to aggregates, are presented using the most up-to-date data and techniques.",

In this paper we examine the validity of this approach based on an analysis of a year-long data set from a permanent noise monitoring network located in the city of Dublin, Ireland. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on more than 1.02 million LAeq measurements at five temporal levels \u2013 month, week, day and hour \u2013 are presented. The results demonstrate a large degree of statistically significant difference between periods, at all of the temporal scales examined, suggesting that caution needs to be taken when assuming that noise measurements taken over very short time periods can statistically capture or represent noise levels over longer periods. Our conclusion is that long term noise monitoring is necessary to accurately characterise long term indicators.",

First, the results suggest that economic growth in SSA is driven mainly by water and labor. Capital and energy were found not to significantly drive economic growth. Second, technical change in SSA is scale-biased and factor augmenting; suggesting that efficiency of water withdrawals and labor use would lead to technological progress in SSA. Third, substitution possibilities between water and labor exist indicating that restrictions on water withdrawals would lead to labor intensiveness and vice versa. Finally, a more general insight from the study is that efficient use of water resources promotes technological innovation and hence, critical for sustainable development.",

This forms the main reason of abandonment of vernacular mud housing building technology in rural areas today. The present paper presents an attempt to improve upon the low durability of adobe blocks by addition of natural reinforcement of Grewia Optiva and Pinus Roxburghii which otherwise are treated as waste material in rural areas. Experimental investigations were carried out for cylindrical and cubical stabilized and unstabilized soil samples. Durability tests conducted included wetting and drying test, water absorption and expansion test, sponge water absorption test, spray test, total absorption test, and water strength coefficient tests carried out as per Indian standards and international research. Results indicated that durability of stabilized soil samples increases by 72% and 68% for fibers of Grewia Optiva and Pinus Roxburghii as compared with unstabilized soil samples. The results recommend that fibers of Grewia Optiva and Pinus Roxburghii can be advantageously added in adobe blocks for improving durability. This would propagate durable mud housing on a large scale thereby reducing housing shortage especially in developing countries, economizing use of natural resources, reducing energy consumption during manufacturing of modern construction materials and most importantly provide sustainable way of living.",

     "abstract": "Lateritic soil with high liquid-limits is commonly used for roadbed construction. However lateritic soil has properties that are sensitive to moisture, and therefore a common method of treating the soil is by adding lime to it. However, it is difficult to mix lime with lateritic soil homogeneously in the field as lateritic soil is prone to agglomeration. Therefore, agglomeration size is important and in this study, soil agglomerates are tested for their California bearing ratio (CBR). Lime (Ca(OH)2) is added to one of the groups of soil samples and the other group is left untreated. The results show that soil that has been treated with lime both hardens and softens, which is related to the agglomerate size, whereas the untreated soil just hardens. The agglomerate size that corresponds to the maximum CBR value is not consistent with that of maximum dry density. Moreover, the CBR values of soil that has been treated with lime are higher than those of the untreated soil for an agglomerate size that ranges from 0.5\u00a0mm to 2\u00a0cm. Beyond this range, the addition of lime does not improve the lateritic soil. Compaction status and water intrusion are two important influential factors on CBR values. Therefore, it is necessary to take further measures to prevent moisture infiltration and migration of water.",

Environmental regulations and standards are important as they maintain balance among competing resources and help protect human health and the environment. One important environmental standard is related to municipal solid waste (MSW). Proper MSW management is crucial for urban public health. Meanwhile, the sustainability of landfills is also of concern as increasing volumes of MSW consume finite landfill space. The incineration of MSW and the reuse of incinerated residues help alleviate the burden on landfill space. However, the reuse of MSW incinerator residues must be regulated because they may expose the environment to toxic heavy metal elements. The study of environmental standards from different countries applicable to MSW is not widely published, much less those for incinerated MSW residue reuse. This paper compares extant waste classification and reuse standards pertinent to MSW, and explores the unique recent history and policy evolution in some countries exhibiting high environmental regard and rapid changes, so that policy makers can propose new or revise current MSW standards in other countries.",

These include micro-wind turbines, photovoltaics, small hydro power generators and bio-tech systems. Besides building integrated solar electric generators otherwise referred to as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), which is aesthetically appealing and forms part of the applied building fabrics, most other options could deform the building aesthetics and require large spaces for both installation and operation especially, the wind turbine. These advantages and more make BIPV one of the most attractive sustainable energy technologies in contemporary building sectors at the moment. The technology involves the integration of photovoltaics (PV) modules into the fabric and shell of buildings like the roofs, asphalt shingles, facade materials and shading elements. Used in this way the integrated PV modules could replace conventional building materials thereby benefiting from improved capital cost and reduction of carbon footprint in the applied environment. However, one major lapse identified with previous studies had been the unavailability of numerical methods and quantification of the CO2 mitigated by applied low carbon technologies.Using a parametric method with the aid of Kyoto platform software integrated into a state of the art SMA data technology, this paper assesses and quantifies the CO2 avoidance by a building integrated solar electric system applied in a business/commercial building in the UK.The CO2 protection capacity of the solar electric system has been confirmed to be influenced by the different seasons of the year providing maximum environmental protection in the summer months.",

Shift of population from rural to urban cities is leading to the associated burden of mass housing facilities. The paper discusses the economic feasibility of using energy conservation green components by performing their life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) in large mass housing projects. A total of six components including solar applications have been evaluated for a case project placed in Mumbai suburban location in India. LCCA is performed from the projections of Wholesale price indices and wholesale market price fluctuations of the commodities. Labour cost projections are performed from minimum wages provided by the ministry. For calculation of savings, exponential increase in electricity tariff is considered. The capital cost of energy components contributes in the range of 5\u20137% to the conventional built up area cost. LCCA suggests that the significant share of cost is related to maintenance, repair and replacement activities of all components. Financial analysis results suggest that the components provide a payback of 11\u00a0years at 8% discounting rate and 7\u00a0years at non discounted values.

In developing a sustainable water supply system, it is important to identify the dominant water demand factors for any given water supply scheme. This paper applies principal components analysis to identify the factors that dominate residential water demand using the Blue Mountains Water Supply System in Australia as a case study. The results show that the influence of community intervention factors (e.g. use of water efficient appliances and rainwater tanks) on water demand are among the most significant. The result also confirmed that the community intervention programmes and water pricing policy together can play a noticeable role in reducing the overall water demand. On the other hand, the influence of rainfall on water demand is found to be very limited, while temperature shows some degree of correlation with water demand. The results of this study would help water authorities to plan for effective water demand management strategies and to develop a water demand forecasting model with appropriate climatic factors to achieve sustainable water resources management. The methodology developed in this paper can be adapted to other water supply systems to identify the influential factors in water demand modelling and to devise an effective demand management strategy.",

Further to this, the paper identified an array of energy models that have evolved over the years together with their capability of analysing energy consumption and their associated carbon emission trends in housing sector of the economy. The results of the study showed that econometric (mainly top-down), building physics, and statistical (mainly bottom-up) methods are the existing approaches that have found application in modelling HECCE issues. However, a number of limitations were noticed in these existing modelling techniques.

The paper also highlights the need to switch over from the utilization of artificial fibres, which are non-renewable and fossil fuel products, to environmental beneficial materials like green fibres. The utilization of plant products like sisal and jute fibres and their composites in various structural engineering applications addresses the issues of sustainability and renewability with constructional materials. The paper describes a suitable mechanical treatment method like high temperature conditioning, which aids us in further improving the properties of these woven natural materials like sisal and jute for composite fabrication and utilization. Heat treated natural fibres of woven sisal and jute were utilized for confining concrete cylinders similar to CFRP and GFRP confinement and their confinement characteristics were obtained and compared. All the cylinders were subjected to monotonic axial compressive loads, so as to evaluate the effect of confinement on the axial load carrying capacity and all their failure modes were discussed thoroughly. The results indicated superior performance by sisal FRP as well as jute FRP confined cylinders as compared to controlled or unconfined cylinders, also sisal FRP wrapped cylinders displayed ultimate axial load of comparable magnitude to CFRP confinement. Natural FRP confinement displayed superior confinement modulus and confinement strength, also the ultimate axial load of concrete cylinders confined with natural FRPs underwent 66% enhancement by sisal FRP and 48% enhancement by jute FRP, in comparison with controlled or unconfined cylinders. Enhancement in axial load carrying capacity was 83% with CFRP confinement and 180% with GFRP confinement. Although natural FRP displayed lower enhancement in axial load carrying capacity in comparison with artificial FRP confinement, but enhanced load carrying capabilities alongside superior sustainability and environmental friendly indices could be obtained using the same, because of various advantages associated with the use of natural fibres.",

     "abstract": "In this study, compressive strength and flow behavior of fly ash incorporated cement paste and mortar were investigated. For this purpose, four water to binder ratios (w/(c\u00a0+\u00a0f)) such as 0.25, 0.35, 0.45 and 0.55 with three curing ages and five wide range of fly ash replacement levels (f/c ratio) namely 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 were introduced in the experimental scheme. The workability of the mixture was ensured through Marsh cone and flow table tests for fly ash blended cement paste and mortar, respectively. The test result showed that compressive strength increases with age as expected in all cases and an empirical relationship for compressive strength of blended cement paste and mortar with mix factors such as w/(c\u00a0+\u00a0f) ratio, f/c ratio and age is also proposed. The estimated compressive strength versus w/(c\u00a0+\u00a0f) ratio curves for different curing ages and f/c ratios resembles the nature of Abrams\u2019 strength versus w/c ratio curves.",

Design of Experiment and Principal Component Analysis methods were applied to find the most significant factors and reduction dimension of initial variables. It was observed that in two climates of temperate and hot-arid, using double glazed windows was beneficial in both cold and hot months whereas in cold and hot-humid climates where heating and cooling loads are dominant respectively, they were advantageous in only those dominant months.

To achieve the foregoing objective parameters like Land use and Energy have been identified. An analysis of the basic sustainability parameters with regard to the various institutional surveys indicates the changing trends over the years. The trend reflects institutional growth, improvement in the economy and growing of awareness of sustaining the ecological environment. However, the extent to which each parameter is addressed varies from institution to institution, as well as the geographical location and climatic variations due to the diverse nature of these two factors in the Indian context.

     "abstract": "New Zealand is susceptible to a wide range of natural hazard events. The response of dwellings to these adverse events is critical to both the resilience of whole communities and the individuals within them, with older people being particularly vulnerable when homes are damaged or destroyed. Older people are defined as those 65\u00a0years and older. In New Zealand, most older people are owner-occupiers and they must therefore confront the tasks of making good their dwellings and dealing with insurance companies after an adverse event. This research investigates just how vulnerable older people are in adverse natural events, through the examination of both physical and functional aspects of their dwelling, compared to those dwellings owned by the general population.The data from the 2010 House Condition Survey (HCS) by BRANZ (an independent research, testing and consulting company providing resources for the New Zealand building industry) provided an opportunity for a preliminary examination of this, in particular the resilience of the New Zealand dwelling stock in the context of storms and weather-related adverse events. An assessment was then made of the vulnerable features of housing inhabited by the general population compared with those 65+. It was found that older people do not appear to be substantially or systematically more exposed to dwellings with less resilient designs, materials or amenities. This paper identifies some additional questions to the existing HCS that will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of households\u2019 storm-related resilience in New Zealand.",

     "abstract": "Adobe is a commonly used building material in rural houses of district Hamirpur of the North Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Adobe is a sustainable material but has limitations of building smaller room sizes and requires frequent maintenance which is not suitable for modern lifestyle. These become main reasons for rejection of adobe as a building material. Initial investigation comprising of water content analysis, specific gravity analysis, grain size analysis, plastic limit and liquid limit analysis, maximum dry density check reveals that soil is sand clay and its low compressive strength shall be increased for enhancing its sustainability. For this purpose, stabilization with natural fibers of Pinus roxburghii and Grewia optiva in 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% proportions is proposed. Total 360 cubical and cylindrical shaped samples of both stabilized and unstabilized compositions were prepared and tested in a laboratory according to Indian standards. Unconfined compressive strength tests and maximum Stress Carrying Capacity tests were conducted after 07\u00a0days, 14\u00a0days, 28\u00a0days, 56\u00a0days and 90\u00a0days of casting. Results reveal that compressive strength of soil increases by 131\u2013145% with addition of fiber P. roxburghii and 225\u2013235% with addition of fiber G. optiva for cubical and cylindrical samples respectively. Increased compressive strength also results in a reduced thickness of traditional mud walls thereby increasing internal room size which would suit to changed modern lifestyle requirements. Enhanced properties of adobe will result in wider acceptance of adobe as a building material that will make development of rural housing more sustainable on a wider scale.",

This has brought two-fold implications-pushing it high up the mega-city size ladder while also posing the planners and city managers with more complex spatial and socio-economic challenges to deal with the rapidly expanding urban footprint. Updating the knowledge and evidence-base of Dhaka\u2019s urban growth dynamics becomes increasingly crucial for better functioning of its strategic urban planning and management. Therefore, this research seeks to broaden our knowledge of understanding spatial urban growth patterns and processes of Dhaka over the period of 1988\u20132005. Hybrid spatial modelling frameworks, incorporating statistical models (in the form of weight-of-evidence approach) along with cellular automata functions, therefore, have been used to comprehend the dynamism of rapid urban growth from 1988 to 2005. As expected, the local version of the transition probabilities (where Dhaka was divided into 18 Spatial Planning Zones), produced improved results compared to the global version (i.e. the whole of the Dhaka metropolitan area). The modelling framework has further been tested as a planner\u2019s \u2018what-if\u2019 simulation box to generate near-future scenario using future policy dataset.

     "abstract": "The present day research is focussed on development of alternative binder materials to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) due to huge emissions of green house gases associated with production of OPC. GGBFS-FA based geopolymer binders are an innovative alternative to OPC which can obtain high strengths apart from being eco-friendly; since its production does not involve high energy and also contributes to sustainability by using the industrial waste materials. Steel slag, an industrial by-product obtained from manufacture of steel can be identified as an alternative to natural aggregates for concrete production, since there is a possibility of acute shortage of natural aggregates in future. The present study is conducted to evaluate the performance of weathered steel slag coarse aggregates in GGBFS-FA based geopolymer concrete. GGBFS-FA geopolymer concrete with steel slag coarse aggregates are prepared by replacing natural granite aggregates at different replacement levels i.e. 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% (by volume) and various fresh and mechanical properties are studied. The flexural fatigue behaviour of GGBFS-FA geopolymer concrete with steel slag is also studied in detail. Efforts are also made to model the probabilistic distribution of fatigue data of GGBFS-FA geopolymer concrete at different stress levels using two parameters Weibull distribution. The results indicated that incorporation of steel slag in GGBFS-FA geopolymer concrete resulted in slight reduction in mechanical strength. The water absorption and volume of permeable voids displayed higher values with inclusion of steel slag. Reduction in number of cycles for fatigue failure was observed in geopolymer concrete mixes containing steel slag as compared to granite aggregates. Overall, the performance of steel slag was found to be satisfactory for structural and pavement application and steel slag can be recognised as new construction material.",

The increasing demand for natural resource exploration and exploitation has generated greater attention to the impact of such activity on both the organization and its stakeholders. One solution to mitigate the negative impacts is to regulate it through government agencies and legal requirements. While providing general guidelines, these processes often provide little practical help for firms to address triple bottom line goals in sustainability (i.e. social, economic, environment). More recently, a variety of environmental and sustainability rating tools have been developed to assist firms in making decisions that best fit these goals. While readily used and championed by the building industry, these rating tools have yet to be adopted by adjacent industries like mining, energy, oil & gas, and heavy industrial. This paper outlines potential benefits that these industries could realize in choosing to use such tools for the assessment of sustainability performance.",

     "publication date": "06-2015",
     "abstract": "Renovation of dwellings for energy efficiency has further implications other than only technical and economic dimensions, such as performance and cost reduction. This paper demonstrates how the renovation of dwellings for energy efficiency impacts spatial quality by crossing technical measures of dwelling renovation with the definition of spatial quality proposed in Acre and Wyckmans (2014). The results of this crossing are developed further into a spatial quality assessment. Spatial quality consists of the interaction between four determinants: (1) views, (2) internal spatiality and spatial arrangements, (3) transition between public and private spaces, and (4) perceived, built and human densities (Acre and Wyckmans, 2014). There are two main challenges in this work: first to demonstrate that energy renovation of dwellings affects spatial quality and second, to create a clear and generic way to indicate and assess this effect that also allows comparability between before and after renovation. The current state of the art in building renovation emphasizes technical performance and efficiency, costs and user responses to technology. However, there is a facet that is hardly explored in the current literature, which is how building renovation affects spatial quality.This paper contributes both to the theory and practice in building renovation. First it emphasizes the relevance of non-technical dimensions such as spatial quality and of the need for a cross-disciplinary approach in energy renovation of dwellings. Second, the paper indicates that energy renovation indeed affects spatial quality in dwellings. The main contribution to practice that this article aims to bring forward consists of the spatial quality assessment for dwelling renovation. The technical measures of energy renovation for the building components of floors, internal and external walls, roofs, windows, mechanical services and controls, built area and the use of renewable energy options are considered in this study in relation to their impact on spatial quality. The aim is to identify and strengthen the connection between energy renovation and people\u2019s well-being through spatial quality. The inattention to the potential of non-technical dimensions such as spatial quality, by stakeholders involved in the energy renovation of dwellings, constitutes a lost opportunity to increase occupants\u2019 receptiveness to energy renovation. This receptiveness can be extended by strengthening the connection between renovation of dwellings for energy efficiency and benefits to occupants\u2019 well-being. This work follows the current European tendency of fostering energy deep renovation to reach Europe\u2019s 2050 aspirations (BPIE, 2011). Deep renovation is an ambitious building renovation strategy that encourages high energy savings measures and the whole building approach (BPIE, 2013). The paper is intended to benefit design professionals, and building owners such as individuals, corporate entities, public sector or real estate portfolio holders, because it points out underlying relations between energy renovation and spatial quality that are often not clearly considered in the renovation of dwellings.",

The growing health related symptoms and demand for the electrical energy encourage the occupants to switch over to natural ventilation. Thermal comfort for naturally ventilated buildings mainly depends on the size and orientation of window openings.

One of the major cities, Basra City faced this crisis since 2003 with energy generation declining by 26.4%. The building industry in Iraq represents the largest demand of energy, mainly in residential sector. In fact, most residential buildings depend on conventional construction system. In the past, the traditional system used to provide comfortable conditions during summer and winter. However, because of the increasing effect of global warming and technological advancement, this constructional system is no longer viable. Currently, the Industrial Building System (IBS) represents one of industrialization approaches which aims to enhance building quality and performance. However, the prefabrication construction system is rare and scarce in this country. Based on previous scenarios and researches, this study aims to investigate and compare the level of energy efficiency in the conventional system and IBS. Since it is difficult to collect data because of instability and insufficient provision of energy generation, the study was based on a simulation approach by using the EnergyPlus software to evaluate the actual condition. The study targeted an existing house in Basra (two-stories) with built-up area of 135\u00a0m2. The performance was measured on the two systems throughout the year. The findings showed that the annual energy demand for cooling and heating for the conventional system was 19,311.99\u00a0kWh while the IBS performed efficiently with 7374.57\u00a0kWh. As a result, IBS reduced the annual energy consumption of 37.32% for heating and 65.36% for cooling.",

Therefore, achieving systematic and contextual development is the most challenging concern in all urban developments. This scenario is most critical in environmentally sensitive hill towns which have witnessed huge inappropriate development in last few decades. However, to achieve systematic and contextual development different building regulations like, floor area ratio (F.A.R.), setbacks, ground coverage, and height of building are enforced, but the problem of inappropriate development persists.Setback is a regulation which controls the spacing between buildings to have adequate solar exposure and ventilation. Presently, setback regulations are enforced uniformly throughout a hill town for a particular use which results in inadequate solar exposure to buildings, high energy consumption and unhealthy living conditions.This paper attempts to highlight a new approach to formulate setback regulations based on topography, slope direction, building height and access road for specific context to Shimla (the largest hilltop town of India) after the in depth study of problems of existing setback regulations in Indian hill towns.",

     "abstract": "Although environmentally sustainable interior design (ESID) has become a major issue in interior design practice, according to the literature the frequency with which interior designers make sustainable choices in real practice is still limited, particularly where materials selection is concerned. This research aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes a sustainable material choice and subsequently undertake a study of the current supply of and demand for green, sustainable and Fair Trade (GSFT) products for interior design practice.In the first instance a desk study of currently available GSFT materials was undertaken. Following this non-participant structured observation of accessibility of GSFT products and a survey on the supply of GSFT materials was undertaken. Finally semi structured interviews with retailers were conducted.The results demonstrate the wide range of GSFT products that are currently in the marketplace (including fabrics, window treatments, surface materials, flooring, walls and ceilings) and indeed many of these materials and products could be sourced from the retail outlets surveyed during the research. However it was not easy to readily identify GSFT products and frequently the researcher had to look through volumes of materials, relying on personal knowledge and manufacturers\u2019 literature to determine the provenance of the materials marketed. Sourcing products in this way is inefficient and time consuming and has been highlighted as a barrier to engaging in ESID in the literature.Only a small number of the retailers interviewed have actively encouraged their customers to purchase GSFT. This reluctance to promote GSFT may reflect a lack of information on the provenance of materials to hand but also their belief that people are not aware of the benefits of either sustainable or green materials and therefore not engaged in ESID. If they perceived that there was a greater demand for GSFT products, the retailers may choose to promote these materials more effectively.The research has confirmed how difficult it is to find information on the provenance of materials to encourage the practice of ESID. Better access to a basic knowledge of sustainability as well as more up-to-date information about sustainable materials will play a critical role in promoting sustainable practice.",

Human intervention for its developmental activities results in several environmental changes that enhance some species, ecosystem and ecological processes while at the same time brings irrecoverable damage to the Planet Earth. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The focus of this paper is to emphasize the organized urban planning at a macro level and the architectural design interventions at the micro level in Vijayawada where eco \u2013 sensitivity exists with due consideration to ecological integrity and environmental protection. The ecological dynamics of continuity indicated that hillocks of Vijayawada region are a part of Eastern Ghats. The study is to elaborate that the landscape, eco-patches and its connectivity establishes a unique corridor to strengthen ecological system and as a green corridor to Vijayawada city to fulfill the demands of the city and also to create the ecological patch connectivity to scattered Eastern Ghats especially in the Krishna-Guntur region which connects the Nallamala hills through Kondapalli hill toward Sothern side and to the Papikondalu at the northern side of Eastern Ghats. These corridors may even support environmental conservation and provides rural edge in urban context and functions as lung spaces to ease the heat island effect of urban settlement. So the explicit development controls have been derived to guide and organize at micro level so as to achieve the macro level considerations of ecological integrity.",

     "abstract": "Urban growth is a worldwide phenomenon but the rate of urbanization is very fast in developing country like Egypt. It is mainly driven by unorganized expansion, increased immigration, rapidly increasing population. In this context, land use and land cover change are considered one of the central components in current strategies for managing natural resources and monitoring environmental changes. In Egypt, urban growth has brought serious losses of agricultural land and water bodies. Urban growth is responsible for a variety of urban environmental issues like decreased air quality, increased runoff and subsequent flooding, increased local temperature, deterioration of water quality, etc. Egypt possessed a number of fast growing cities. Mansoura and Talkha cities in Daqahlia governorate are expanding rapidly with varying growth rates and patterns. In this context, geospatial technologies and remote sensing methodology provide essential tools which can be applied in the analysis of land use change detection. This paper is an attempt to assess the land use change detection by using GIS in Mansoura and Talkha from 1985 to 2010. Change detection analysis shows that built-up area has been increased from 28 to 255\u00a0km2 by more than 30% and agricultural land reduced by 33%. Future prediction is done by using the Markov chain analysis. Information on urban growth, land use and land cover change study is very useful to local government and urban planners for the betterment of future plans of sustainable development of the city.",

The University utilises a Building Management System (BMS) to reduce its overall operational energy consumption.This LCA analysis employed a \u2018mining to use\u2019 approach, in other words, the analysis takes into account all of the stages up to the utilisation stage. The life cycle GHG emissions and embodied energy of Building 216 were calculated to be 14,229\u00a0tonne CO2-e and 172\u00a0TJ, respectively. This paper identified the \u2018hotspots\u2019, or the stages in production and operation of Building 216 that were the cause of the majority of the GHG emissions. From this, proposals for further improvements in environmental management may be made. The usage stage of the building produces 63% less GHG emissions than the University average, due to the implementation of the BMS. This system has played a significant role in reducing the total embodied energy consumption of the building (i.e., 20% less than the University average).",

In the present study back propagation was used to predict the 28\u00a0day compressive strength of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) along with two other data driven techniques namely Model Tree (MT) and Non-linear Regression (NLR). Recycled aggregate is the current need of the hour owing to its environmental friendly aspect of re-use of the construction waste. The study observed that, prediction of 28\u00a0day compressive strength of RAC was done better by ANN than NLR and MT. The input parameters were cubic meter proportions of Cement, Natural fine aggregate, Natural coarse Aggregates, recycled aggregates, Admixture and Water (also called as raw data). The study also concluded that ANN performs better when non-dimensional parameters like Sand\u2013Aggregate ratio, Water\u2013total materials ratio, Aggregate\u2013Cement ratio, Water\u2013Cement ratio and Replacement ratio of natural aggregates by recycled aggregates, were used as additional input parameters. Study of each network developed using raw data and each non dimensional parameter facilitated in studying the impact of each parameter on the performance of the models developed using ANN, MT and NLR as well as performance of the ANN models developed with limited number of inputs. The results indicate that ANN learn from the examples and grasp the fundamental domain rules governing strength of concrete.",

     "abstract": "The construction and building process depends on substantial consumption of natural resources with far-reaching impacts beyond their development area. In general, a significant portion of annual resource consumption by the building and construction industry is a result of applying traditional building strategies and practices such as designing and selecting types of development (e.g. multi-unit condo and single-family house, etc.), building materials and structure, heating/cooling systems, and planning renovation and maintenance practices. On the other hand, apart from structural suitability, building developers mostly consider the basic requirements of public owners or private occupants of the buildings, where the main criteria for selecting building strategies are costs, and long-term environmental and socio-economic impacts are generally ignored. The main purpose of this paper is to develop an improved building sustainability assessment framework to measure and integrate different sustainability factors, i.e. long-term environmental upstream and downstream impacts and associated socio-economic costs, in a unified and quantitative basis. The application of the proposed framework has been explained through a case study of single-family houses and multi-unit residential buildings in Canada. A comprehensive framework based on the integration of emergy synthesis and life cycle assessment (LCA) has been developed and applied. The results of this research prove that the proposed emergy-based life cycle assessment (Em-LCA) framework offers a practical sustainability assessment tool by providing quantitative and transparent results for informed decision-making.",

For this reason, moving towards a greener architecture is considered the main goal of the contemporary architecture of our time. The goal of this study is to analyse architectural projects that have been already performed in the Middle East countries in terms of their compatibility with actual concepts of sustainability and their required green criteria. Therefore, for the sake of review and study, this paper is intended to discover up to what level the sustainability rating system such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) can be effective in rating contemporary architectural projects. Studies indicate three concepts for analysing contemporary architecture and have found to be descriptive: (1) green, (2) pseudo green and (3) energy-monger. The studies have also shown that some of the projects, although trying to display sustainable architecture concepts in appearance, in reality they turned out not to be sustainable enough. In latter steps, this paper intends to evaluate and examine the effectiveness of the LEED rating system. In evaluating LEED rating system, the results inferred indicate that the system is intended more for programming than actual designing purposes and is not an efficient instrument for analysing architectural design process. Analysis based on this study suggests that, for moving from pseudo green to green architecture, it is necessary to use design-oriented patterns.",

While the top-down methods drive performance improvement by ranking a building against its peers, the bottom-up methods are focused on the building\u2019s specific context. Consequently, the bottom-up methods can help identify how performance improvement could be materialised. These two complementary approaches can improve design practice and facilities\u2019 management. Two bottom-up methods that could be used for energy benchmarking have been reviewed using UK schools as case studies: Building physics and aggregated end-use. The aim is to demonstrate how these methods could be used for benchmarking and identify their benefits and limitations. When all energy components are included in a model under expected operating conditions, the building physics method can be used to establish a baseline for energy performance. It is demonstrated that where this method is used under standardised operating conditions and is subject to minimum energy performance requirements, as prescribed by the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), it can be used to establish a benchmark for energy performance. It is also shown how aggregated end-use methods such as CIBSE TM22 can be used to define system level benchmarks, and identify the root causes for discrepancy between measured performance and design intent in a systematic way.",

The method accounts for life cycle effects on cost and carbon emissions since refurbished buildings will last for many years.Four schools are identified as representative of school archetypes built in the UK during four distinct periods in the 20th century. The schools are used as a base for simulation of the effects of energy efficient refurbishment of building fabric and heating plant. All possible combinations of the selected measures are simulated. Simulated energy savings are then compared between the four school buildings, demonstrating how physical characteristics of the schools affect the available savings. Simulating combinations of energy efficiency measures allow analysis of interaction effects between measures, and reveals some positive and some negative interactions. A regression model of energy savings in the four schools is also developed.Simulated energy savings are then used as inputs for a life cycle assessment model. Life cycle indicators considered are marginal life cycle cost and marginal life cycle carbon footprint. These metrics are used to rank the energy efficiency measures on net present value and life cycle carbon footprint saving, both individually and in combination with each other.Carbon payback is shorter than financial payback in all scenarios, and all measures and combinations of measures repaid the carbon invested in them. Positive net present value is less common, and frequently depends on air tightness improvements also being achieved.",

     "abstract": "Introducing public bus transit system in Indian cities raises many challenging issues of different nature ranging from technical to operational. The present study examines the impact of a new public bus transit system by applying a binary logit analysis for assessing the possible variation in modal shift behavior. The case study of mode-choice was developed, calibrated, and validated using socio-economic data collected on six proposed corridors in the city of Bardoli, Gujarat, India. Traffic quality parameters, such as average speed, delay, congestion, travel time, and travel cost were modeled to investigate the impact of the new bus transit system in VISSIM environment. The probability of an overall modal shift to proposed bus transit system corridors ranges from 45% to 51%. The maximum modal shift ranges from 80.58% to 87.40% for three-wheelers (para-transit) followed by bicycle and walking mode. However, cars have the least modal shift ranging from 6.78% to 11.49% and 37.38% to 45.46% for two-wheelers. The average speed of the bus transit system in both directions could reach 47.75\u201349.59\u00a0kmph with 15\u00a0min frequency. Likewise, mean travel time was estimated from 1.3 to 1.6\u00a0min per km and average commuter cost of less than Rs. 1.0 per km for bus transit with insignificant delay and congestion. Introduction of the new public bus system shows promising results and has to play a significant role in developing a sustainable urban public transportation system. These findings can be used to form the basis for the implementation of the new public bus transit in peer cities with relatively similar sizes, which may impact an inhabitant sustainable choice on ridership in due course.",

In fact, it is estimated that more than 400,000\u00a0tons of steel slag are generated annually in the country. Gravel, resulting from washing sand, is also produced at more than 500,000\u00a0tons/year in Qatar. Both materials are not efficiently used in the country and most of its aggregate (gabbro) needs are imported from neighboring countries. This paper presents the results obtained on the use of steel slag, gravel and gabbro in concrete. A total of nine concrete mixtures were prepared. One concrete mixture that contained 100% gabbro aggregate was considered as the control mix. Four concrete blends containing 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% steel slag (by weight) were prepared as partial replacements of gabbro aggregates. Another four concrete mixtures containing 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% gravel (by weight) were cast as partial replacements of gabbro aggregates. All samples were cured in a water tank for 7, 28 and 90\u00a0days and then subjected to compressive, flexural and splitting tensile strength tests. All concrete mixtures prepared easily met the 28-day compressive strength design requirement of 28\u00a0MPa. Best results were obtained for concrete prepared using 100% steel slag aggregates. Concrete cast using 100% gravel yielded lower strength results than the control mixture (100% gabbro). However, there was an increase in strength values with an increase in gabbro content in gravel/gabbro mixtures. Additional work is necessary to establish long-term performance, especially concerning what is reported in the literature about the expansive characteristics of steel slag aggregates when used in concrete. It should be noted that concrete cured for 90\u00a0days in the water tank did not exhibit any reversal in strength.",

We further discuss the rationale behind the application of such a sociological concept to science. First, we compare the value of having a relatively short-term outlook (corresponding to the human life span) on the relation between technology and human activities to a 1000-year outlook by considering the correlation between our current situation and past technology, taking note of the scientific and technological policies, and human activities of the past 1000\u00a0years. In particular, we discuss the relationship between human activities and environmental issues. The problem is not one of current sustainability but, rather, of future sustainability. Therefore, the importance of applying the 1000-year outlook to the technology used in various applications is emphasized. Second, by looking back 1000\u00a0years, we discuss the realization of existing technology over that period. Examples of sustainable scientific technology from the past 1000\u00a0years are given, including the importance of artificial structures and new computer systems. Third, solving global environmental problems, including the supply of and demand for food, mitigation of climate change, and the response to natural disasters is an important concern of scientists in the 21st century, and is aided by simulations that include comprehensive historical investigations of civilizations that unify both natural and anthropogenic systems to define 1000-year sustainability scientific technology. The concept of 1000-year sustainability will move from sustainable development to sustainability development or the development of sustainability, which is the goal of a continuous society.",

It was observed that blocks prepared with optimum quantity of lime along with cement has led to continuous buildup of strength even beyond 2\u00a0years, whereas blocks prepared with cement alone and lesser quantity of lime than optimum quantity have not gained much strength after 6\u00a0months from the time of preparation of the blocks.

     "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate and establish the Critical Project Management Success Factors (CPMSF) for the sustainable social (public) housing estates\u2019 delivery/provision in Nigeria. The current housing estate deficit faced in the country is credited to poor and inadequate housing delivery and provision by various agencies. Method/design: Documentary analysis of data collection was used in the study which involved an extensive and investigative theoretical review of online and visual document resources, followed by an interpretative identification of categories and limits of various materials and information considered vital to the phenomenon in the study. The documents were analysed with a content analysis approach under four criteria of how: authentic; credible; representative; and meaningful. Findings/results: The study reveals that 22 Critical Project Management Success Factors (CPMSF) are essential for the achievement of sustainable social (public) housing estates\u2019 delivery/provision in Nigeria. These relate to: the project managers\u2019 performance; the organisation that owns the development project; the characteristics of the team members; and the external project environment. At the same time, the study reveals that these are social, economic, and environmental factors that are associated with the triple objectives of sustainable development. Originality/value: This study reflection aims to resolve or reduce to a minimum the acknowledged housing estate delivery and provision inadequacy problems in the country, and by exploring this phenomenon, best practise project management techniques will be understood and used to provide sustainable social (public) housing estate units for the Nigerian populace.",

     "abstract": "Meeting the housing needs in Nigeria is a long-standing task, yet to be realised. The economy of the country, as most developing countries, is ailing with limited resources. Energy and infrastructures are inadequate, yet the use of cement dominated the construction industry. Earth construction is a sustainable option to housing with inherent characteristics that should be desirable in the ailing economy of hot tropical environment in Africa. However, most Nigerians are skeptical of taking a low cost option with less modern effects and uncertain durability. This research explores the issues relating to this problem and aims to bridge the gap between Nigerians and earth, which exists in abundance in Africa. The emerging concept from the survey of public reaction to earth construction in Nigeria is of a shelled compressed earth block (SCEB) of an inner core of \u2018earth\u2019 with less stabilisation and an outer shell of the same earth composition but with higher ratio of cement stabilisation for adequate durability, compressed into a single piece. A mechanical kit was designed and fabricated for the production of sample shelled compressed earth block for laboratory tests. Basic preliminary tests were conducted on the model and results revealed that the concept was feasible thus paved the way for further research work in shelled compressed earth block (SCEB).",

The methodological process employed is the multiple case studies used to diagnose the main barriers to installing green buildings in these two cases. The intention, of the institutions, to adopt greener buildings has been observed, considering the commitment of top management and that the institutions have put forth to accelerate this greening process. However, the barriers to adoption are evident, especially those of a technical and cultural origin. Based on these results, the study proposes possible solutions and guidelines to overcome such barriers, aimed at facilitating the adoption of green technologies in the buildings at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)/Schools/Colleges of Engineering.",

     "abstract": "Today\u2019s construction projects are highly mechanized and becoming more so every day. With the growing industrialization of construction work, the role of onsite equipment and machineries is vital in achieving productivity and efficiency. During the construction phase, selection of right equipment has always been a key factor in the success of any construction project. This decision is typically made by matching equipment available in a fleet with the tasks at hand. Such analysis accounts for equipment productivity, equipment capacity, and cost. However, the emerging notion of sustainability in construction has emphasized energy conservation, efficiency, green environment, economy and human well being. In this context, selecting the most appropriate equipment from the available options is highly challenging. Therefore, this paper aims to determine a selection criteria based on the fundamental concept of sustainability and provides an assessment framework. A questionnaire survey was conducted among a classified group of Malaysian contractors to elicit information pertaining to the sustainable selection of onsite machineries. The findings of this study will guide the decision makers to appraise the selection process of construction equipment on the triple bottom line of sustainability.",

     "abstract": "For stormwater system design, flood estimation and many other environmental assessment tasks, design rainfall is an essential input. Estimation of design rainfall is generally made using a regionalization technique based on a regional database of observed rainfalls. Many countries have derived their own generalized design rainfall data, which are generally expressed in the form of intensity\u2013duration\u2013frequency (IDF) curves. In Qatar, situated in an arid region, the existing IDF data were developed in 1991 using a limited data set. This paper presents the development of new IDF data for the State of Qatar using the method of L-moments and the index regional frequency analysis approach. The daily rainfall data from 32 stations located in Qatar and nearby Gulf countries have been used to form a homogeneous region. It has been found that the Pearson Type 3 distribution best fits the 24-h duration annual maximum rainfall data in the Qatar region. For the ungauged case, a prediction equation is developed where mean annual maximum rainfall is expressed as a function of climatic and physiographic characteristics. From a leave-one-out validation, it has been found that the developed prediction equation can estimate mean annual maximum rainfall with a median relative error of about 5.5%. Finally, an approximate method is used to obtain design rainfalls for other durations due to the limitations of continuous pluviograph data in Qatar. The new set of IDF curves is based on a much bigger dataset than the existing 1991 IDF curves. It is expected that the new IDF curves will have wider application in Qatar and will provide a statistically sound basis for storm water design, flood and environmental studies. The method can be applied to other middle-eastern states and similar arid countries in the world.",

This article provides an overview mainly from two aspects, the vegetation on the green roofs and its benefits toward the surrounding environments. Vegetation is the key element in installing green roofs. It also provides some factors in choosing suitable plants on rooftops, factors including species that are drought tolerant, solar radiation tolerant, and cooling ability of plants. In addition, green roofs play a critical role in improving the urban environment by enriching the biodiversity, delaying the storm peak to the drainage system, diminishing the runoff quantity, purifying the air pollutants as well as the runoff quality.",

An integrated model that relates a fuzzy logic decision support system with cost estimation for concrete box-girder bridges is presented. Model development methodology comprises an integrated preliminary cost estimation system (IPCES), and complex quality functions and deployment of a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. An actual case project is used to validate and illustrate model corresponding estimating capabilities. The proposed model is engineered to enhance existing techniques implemented by bridge stakeholders and designers to prepare cost estimates at the conceptual design stage by taking into consideration box-girder bridge project site preparations, substructure, and superstructure. The proposed model is anticipated to be of major significance to designers and its contribution resides into the integration of BrIM technologies with cost estimation approaches.",

     "abstract": "Water and food security are the key challenges under climate change as both are highly vulnerable to continuously changing climatic patterns. Studies have predicted that the average global temperature may increase by 1.4\u20135.8\u00a0\u00b0C and there would be substantial reduction in fresh water resources and agricultural yield by the end of the 21st century. Approximately 75% of the Himalayan glaciers are on retreat and will disappear by 2035. Moreover in Africa (Sub-Saharan Africa) by 2050 the rainfall could drop by 10%, which would reduce drainage by 17%. Majority of the fresh water resources has already been depleted and there is reduction in agricultural production globally with escalation in population and food demand. Some of the prominent climate change impacts are, growing deserts, and increase in the magnitude of floods and droughts. An extreme decline in crop yields in arid and semi arid areas globally has caused food shortages and a manifold increase in food inflation. Countries of Africa, Middle East, Arab and Asia have close economic ties with natural resource and climate-dependent sectors such as forestry, agriculture, water, and fisheries. This manuscript highlights groundwater recharge by utilization of wastewater using the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) method in irrigation and the significance and methods of artificial recharge of groundwater. This paper also presents easily and economically feasible options to ensure water and food security under climate change and recommend formation of effective adaptation and mitigation polices and strategies to minimizing the impact of climate change on water resources and irrigation.",

A review of energy benchmarks that underpin the UK\u2019s Display Energy Certificate (DEC) scheme have prompted necessities to explore the benefits and limitations of using various methods to derive energy benchmarks. The existing methods were reviewed and grouped into top-down and bottom-up approaches based on the granularity of the data used. In the study, two top-down methods, descriptive statistics and artificial neural networks (ANN), were explored for the purpose of benchmarking energy performances of schools. The results were used to understand the benefits of using these benchmarks for assessing energy efficiency of buildings and the limitations that affect the robustness of the derived benchmarks. Compared to the bottom-up approach, top-down approaches were found to be beneficial in gaining insight into how peers perform. The relative rather than absolute feedback on energy efficiency meant that peer pressure was a motivator for improvement. On the other hand, there were limitations with regard to the extent to which the energy efficiency of a building could be accurately assessed using the top-down benchmarks. Moreover, difficulties in acquiring adequate data were identified as a key limitation to using the top-down approach for benchmarking non-domestic buildings. The study suggested that there are benefits in rolling out of DECs to private sector buildings and that there is a need to explore more complex methods to provide more accurate indication of energy efficiency in non-domestic buildings.",

     "abstract": "The performance of cement mortar reinforced with varying percentages of treated bundled date palm fibers is investigated to appraise their feasibility for structural and non-structural applications. The study first entailed the evaluation of two different alkali pre-treatments at varying concentrations by subjecting treated and untreated bundled fibers to tensile testing. The suitable pre-treatment was then adopted while casting cement mortar mixes. The physical properties of fresh mortar was studied through setting times and, for mortar mixes cured up to 28\u00a0days, through parameters such as drying shrinkage and water absorption. The unconfined compressive strengths, split tensile strengths as well as the flexural strengths of the cured mortar mixes at two different ages were undertaken to assess their mechanical properties; while the durability was gauged based on their sulfate resistance for up to a period of four months.Observed stress\u2013strain behavior under tension led to the choice of 0.173% Ca(OH)2 as the preferred pre-treatment for the bundled fibers used in the mortar mixes. This was further supported by the microstructural examination on the hardened mortars which, revealed that the integrity of treated fibers remained intact within the cement matrix without hindering the hydration processes. Results also indicated that inclusion of fibers improves the flexural strengths as well as the sulfate resistance of the mortar mixes. However, the cylinder and cube compressive strengths decreased with the increase in treated fiber inclusion.Although, the work reported in this paper was carried out on cement mortars, conclusions are expected to be relevant to fiber reinforced concrete employing treated natural fibers.",

     "abstract": "Planning and design of buildings in a hill settlement are tedious and challenging task due to difficult terrain, steep gradient, adverse climatic conditions, rich flora and proneness to natural hazards. In response to these harsh development conditions, numerous vernacular practices and styles have evolved with local materials and indigenous techniques to fulfil the needs of people, which cause minimal damage to environment and are sustainable. But, in spite of numerous benefits of these vernacular practices, these are often not used for new development due to increased demand for more built spaces due to rapid growth, availability of new construction materials and techniques and reluctance of residents to adopt vernacular practices.Numerous multi-storeyed buildings with contemporary materials and techniques are being constructed in different hill settlements without respecting the context, which affect health and wellbeing of residents and cause severe damage to sensitive fragile environment in and around hill settlements. Building regulations, which are enforced in hill settlements to regulate development and minimise its ill impacts on environment, are contextually not appropriate and lead to contextually inappropriate development and environmental degradation in environmentally sensitive hill settlements. As vernacular practices are proven to be sustainable, therefore it is essential to take lessons from sustainable vernacular practices for new development and formulation of building regulations for achieving contextually appropriate and sustainable development in hill settlements.",

The degrading environmental quality of settlements is collective result of rapid development, increasing population, depleting vegetation and water resources, excess pollution and waste generation and results in ecological imbalance and climate change at large. The problem of degrading environmental quality is most crucial in hill towns of India which are ecologically most fragile and undergoing rapid urbanization.Hill towns are witness to environmental degradation in the form of changes in the micro climate, loss of vegetation cover, increase in surface run off, reduction in recharging of aquifers and water table, increase in soil erosion, flooding, pollution and increase in occurrences of instability which not only affect the environment of the town but also the surrounding region. To mitigate the impact of development on natural environment and maintaining environmental quality in hill towns, various building regulations related to environmental protection are enforced, but the problem of environmental degradation still persists in hill towns.This paper discusses various building regulations enforced in different hill towns for environmental protection to identify various problems and lacunas, which are responsible for degraded environmental quality in hill towns. Considerations for new building regulations for environmental protection in hill towns have been suggested so that environmentally sound and sustainable developments in ecologically fragile hill towns can be achieved",

     "abstract": "The aim of engineers is to design structures, while minimising their energy dependence and create a suitable environment for living. Some of the most important factors for maintaining the indoor environment are temperature and humidity. Unsuitable combinations of heat and moisture (HAM) could indicate a danger of mould growing. The mould\u2019s existence influences the reliability and lifespan of a structure. Some materials, for example wood, are very sensitive to mould growth. To analyse a structure for mould growth risk it is necessary to know the values of temperature and relative humidity on the surfaces and inside of structures. There are two possibilities to acquire these quantities; taking measurements at a construction site or in a laboratory, or applying numerical solutions using an accessible programme. One such programme is Wufi, which has been developed especially for HAM analysis. An advantage of measuring at the construction site is the reality, which is not affected by numerical errors. On the other hand, numerical analysis usually needs lower costs and does not demand so much time to simulate long term periods. From the point of view of accuracy, it is suitable to verify the numerical solution with measurements. The aim of this paper is threefold. First, to analyse the risk of mould growth. Second, it presents a verification of numerically calculated data using Wufi 2D against actual measurement data acquired from a real structure, which is presented by a low-energy house located in Oulu/Finland. Third, to prove that the form of low-energy building structures do not increase mould growth risk. After carrying out the verification, the received outcomes are utilised for mould growth analysis. For an expression of reality in the numerical solution, a transient simulation was needed. The received outcomes were then used for mould growth analyses. There is a possibility to predict real mould growth risk inside the structure and on its surfaces, corresponding to the critical relation between temperature and relative humidity, which separates favourable and unfavourable areas for mould growth.",

     "abstract": "Due to the sheer volume of construction activities in Qatar, the market of building materials including aggregates is stressed. The commercially available natural aggregates are either local limestone aggregate or imported limestone as well as gabbro aggregates from the United Arab Emirates. In addition, recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) are produced since 2009 as a result of the extensive construction and demolition activities. It is estimated that around 20,000 tons of construction and demolition (C&D) wastes are produced daily in Qatar; half of which are converted daily to RCA. Imported limestone and gabbro aggregates are widely employed for various construction activities in Qatar; however the use of local limestone aggregates are limited due to their substantial heterogeneity, uncontrolled water absorption and abrasion quality. Although, the specification of RCA for concrete applications has recently been introduced through the revised Qatar construction standards (QCS) in 2010, their commercial use is under experimental evaluation. However, the properties of the aforementioned virgin and recycled coarse aggregates were hardly ever systematically published. Hence, this study presents the initial physiochemical characterization and comparison of the virgin aggregate properties, with those of locally available RCA as a sustainable alternative. The physiochemical properties were bench marked against the stipulated thresholds of QCS (2010) and other characterization properties.It was observed that both local limestone and RCA have inferior water absorption and porosity characteristics in comparison to imported gabbro and limestone aggregates. Previous international standards and studies have demonstrated the successful partial RCA replacement of imported virgin aggregates in concrete applications; and if implemented, could potentially offer significant economic and environmental benefits to the State of Qatar.However, it was recommended to undertake further laboratory studies to assess the mechanical performance and durability of such replacements prior to practical implementations within the construction industry in Qatar.",

As India is one of the largest producers of jute, hence its potential application in many branches of engineering should be developed. In the present work the efficacy of jute textile reinforced polymer composite (JFRP) as compared to CFRP and GFRP for the flexural strengthening of reinforced concrete beams was compared by carrying out bending test on reinforced concrete beams in three groups of fourteen beams. The work carries out the study of failure modes, flexural strengthening effect on ultimate load and load deflection behaviour as well as the deflection ductility study of RC beams bonded externally with JFRP, CFRP and GFRP, wrapped in U configuration in single layer, along the entire length of the beam in full wrapping and strip wrapping technique. The results depicted that JFRP, CFRP and GFRP, strengthening improved the ultimate flexural strength of the RC beams by 62.5%, 150% and 125%, respectively, with full wrapping technique and by 25%, 50% and 37.5%, respectively with strip wrapping technique. JFRP strengthening displayed highest deformability index and proved that jute textile FRP material has huge potential as a structural strengthening material.",

     "abstract": "The introduction of dynamic envelope components and systems can have a significant reduction effect on heating and cooling demands. In addition, it can contribute to reduce the energy demand for artificial lighting by better utilization of daylight.One of these promising technologies is Phase Change Materials (PCM). Here, the latent heat storage potential of the transition between solid and liquid state of a material is exploited to increase the thermal mass of the component. A PCM layer incorporated in a transparent component can increase the possibilities to harvest energy from solar radiation by reducing the heating/cooling demand and still allowing the utilization of daylight.Measurements have been performed on a state-of-the-art, commercially available window that integrates PCM using a large scale climate simulator. The glazing unit consists of a four-pane glazing with an integrated layer that dynamically controls the solar transmittance (prismatic glass) in the outer glazing cavity. The innermost cavity is filled with a PCM, contained in transparent plastic containers.When dynamic components are incorporated in the building envelope, it makes the characterization of static performance (e.g. the thermal transmittance, U-value; the solar heat gain coefficient) insufficient in giving the full picture regarding the performance of the component in question.This article presents a series of preliminary measurements, and the related methodologies, carried out on a window with incorporated PCM. The tests have been carried out using several test cycles comprised of temperature and solar radiation cycling, where the aim has been to delve deeper into the possibilities for the characterization of dynamic building envelope components by full scale testing in a climate simulator, showing potentials and limitations of this approach and measurement facility.It was found that even for temperatures similar to a warm day in Nordic climate, the potential latent heat storage capacity of the PCM was fully activated. Long periods of sun combined with high exterior temperatures are needed.",

Dental and skeleton fluorosis is a common disease among children (>10\u00a0years) and adults of all age groups. To understand the factors causing the dental and skeletal fluorosis diseases and their source in groundwater a study based on water quality analysis of aquifers in and around stone quarries, was carried out. All the dug wells are dry and majority of the hand pumps are equipped with the jet pumps in the block. Water samples were collected from hand pumps and tube wells in June 2012 and February 2013. Fluoride zonation and groundwater salinity maps were generated for shallow and deep aquifers. These analyses show drastic changes in the salinity levels of shallow and deep aquifers. The deep aquifers are more saline as compared to the shallow aquifers. On the contrary, the concentration of chemical constituents such as Na+, K+, Cl\u2212 and F\u2212 was more in the shallow aquifers compared to the deep aquifers. Concentration of fluoride was found more in villages near or within the stone quarries (shallow aquifers between 1.7 to 3.8\u00a0mg/l and 1.5 to 3.6\u00a0mg/l in June 2012 and February, 2013 respectively and in deep aquifers between 1.2 to 2.7\u00a0mg/l and 1.1 to 2.7\u00a0mg/l in June 2012 and February, 2013 respectively) as compared to the villages approximately 1\u20131.5\u00a0km far from these quarries.

Different green building certification schemes are deployed worldwide to encourage creating a sustainable built environment and the adoption of green building best practices.Micro-generation technologies, low and zero carbon, are either recommended by designers or mandated. A range of constraints including design and technical issues, are currently affecting the wide-scale deployment of micro-generation. For instance, it is important that the micro-generation plant operates for as many hours as possible as an idle plant accrues no benefits. Such issues make the design of a micro-cogeneration technology not quite as straightforward. Combined Heat and Power (CHP) or micro-cogeneration provides means of electricity and heat supply.This paper investigates, through a detailed study, the maximum CO2 reduction that could be achieved by CHP and biomass technologies in a mixed-use development. The implementation of micro-cogeneration, its combination with district heating and the integration of CHP into a trigeneration scheme are investigated. The coupling of CHP unit with absorption cooling, as well as the interactions with biomass boilers, to allow for setting up multi-generation systems for combined local production of different energy vectors are assessed and optimised for maximum CO2 reduction.",

     "abstract": "The cement industry faces a number of challenges that include depleting fossil fuel reserves, scarcity of raw materials, perpetually increasing demand for cements and concretes, growing environmental concerns linked to climate change and an ailing world economy. Every tonne of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) that is produced releases on average a similar amount of CO2 into the atmosphere, or in total roughly 6% of all man-made carbon emissions. Improved production methods and formulations that reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions from the cement manufacturing process are thus high on the agenda. Emission reduction is also needed to counter the impacts on product cost of new regulations, green taxes and escalating fuel prices. In this regard, locally available minerals, recycled materials and (industry, agriculture and domestic) waste may be suitable for blending with OPC as substitute, or in some cases replacement, binders. Fly ash, Blast furnace slag and silica fumes are three well known examples of cement replacement materials that are in use today that, like OPC, have been documented and validated both in laboratory tests and in practice. The first is a by-product of coal combustion, the second of iron smelting and the third of electric arc furnace production of elemental silicon or ferro silicon alloys. This paper presents a concise review of the current state-of-the-art and standards underpinning the production and use of OPC-based cements and concretes. It outlines some of the emerging green alternatives and the benefits they offer. Many of these alternatives rely on technological advances that include energy-efficient, low carbon production methods, novel cement formulations, geopolymers, carbon negative cements and novel concrete products. Finally, the economics of cement production and the trends in the UK, US and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Region are presented, to help guide and inform future developments in cement production based on maximizing the value of carbon reduction.",

This is due to the use of thick conventional insulation to achieve the very low U-values required for the Passive House Standard, which adds to the overall cost of construction and also potentially contributes to problems such as interstitial condensation. High performance, exotic insulation materials such as silica aerogels and vacuum insulation products could help to reduce thickness but at a cost that is at present prohibitive. In this paper the author introduces the basic concept and some illustrative simulated performance results of a new Void Space Dynamic Insulation (VSDI) technology that couples low cost conventional insulation materials with efficient ventilation to deliver low loss building envelopes and high indoor air quality in thin wall construction. The advantages of VSDI are that it eliminates the risk of interstitial condensation and the risk of over-heating during extreme summer months. Importantly, VSDI can be used as a 100% passive component, without a fan to drive the air flow.",

     "abstract": "The built environment has a direct impact on the Gulf Region natural environment, the economy and human health. Buildings have to respond to local climate and site conditions to maximize building users\u2019 comfort and health while minimizing energy use. Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) developed a simplified, standalone, building energy standard to support Qatar\u2019s and the MENA region building energy ratings. Air conditioning counts for more than 60% of the electricity consumption in GCC countries. Consequently, GSAS limited the maximum annual cooling demand for new-build housing compliance in Qatar to 121\u00a0kW\u00a0h/m2. High rated energy-efficient houses must call for 72\u00a0kW\u00a0h/m2 or less. GSAS targets raised the need for innovative passive design technologies to reduce the cooling demand in hot humid climates. A prototype house was constructed to test new technologies and variant insulation techniques, such as dynamic insulation. The house has two operation modes, the static mode and the active mode.This paper presents the Passive-House pilot project construction details and the monitoring results within the tested period. The study compares the annual cooling demand from the simplified GSAS Energy Calculator model and the detailed Dynamic Simulation Model (DSM). Neither model can handle the thermodynamic and fluid dynamic processes of the active insulation. An independent model is used to calculate the heat-transfer coefficient of the dynamically insulated walls, validated experimentally and then coupled with the energy models. The discrepancies in the predicted annual cooling demand between the simplified and detailed models did not exceed 15% for both static and dynamic operations of the Passive-House.Energy assessors can use GSAS Energy Calculator to predict the annual cooling demand with more confidence to demonstrate buildings compliance. Energy models should account for in-use factors to allow for differences in practical installation and performance compared to the laboratory test conditions for selected systems and technologies, which require field trials.",

     "abstract": "Due to the changing nature of the facilities management (FM) profession, facilities managers are increasingly engaged with the evolving sustainability agenda in the UK and the development or uptake of sustainability policies within their organisations. This study investigates how facilities managers are engaging with the sustainability agenda and the drivers, policy issues and information they use to improve their sustainability performance management. A web based self-administered questionnaire survey of facilities managers in the UK was conducted to identify drivers and issues that influence and support good sustainable practices. A total of 268 facilities managers responded. The results indicate that legislation is the most important driver for the implementation of sustainable practices. Corporate image and Organisational ethos are also recognised. However demand for efficient monitoring, management and reporting on environmental impact is not highly rated even though the top three issues of sustainability managed by facilities managers are energy management, waste and recycling management and carbon footprint. In addition, facilities managers are expected to take ownership of activities assigned to the reduction of carbon emission. Government industries and organisation with high turnover are more likely to have a sustainability policy. Financial constraints are the main barriers while legislations are the main driver for implementing sustainability. For non-profit organisations and the charitable sector, financial constraints are no hindrance to implementing a sustainability policy. The conclusion drawn is that sustainability agendas continue to be influenced by regulated environmental issues rather than a balanced approach which takes into consideration the wider social and economic aspects of sustainability. While this scenario is far from ideal, the expectation is that the organisation will trust FM to take a vital role in delivering a comprehensive sustainability policy due to the rising tide of legislation, public scrutiny, as well as the needed business case for genuinely embracing sustainability. However, as the integration of sustainability with core business strategies is continuously evolving the emphasis on different drivers will vary from organisation to organisation as well as the responsibilities of facilities managers.",

The enhancement rate is more when efficiencies of rectifier and LVHX are high. Efficient solution heat exchanger (SHX) is vital owing to its large heat duty. Rectifier loses its importance if high efficiency LVHX is used. Roles of these three components increase at low cooling and high sink temperatures.",

Our cities are in the midst of restructuring space, in terms of both use and form. The paper addresses various complex urban issues associated with the present pattern of urban development through review of urban development of selected metropolitan cities of India which have experienced the impacts of LPG (Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization) process. Spatial trends, prevailing zoning, building bye laws (Floor Area Ratio and density) development control regulations, urban housing and transport are analyzed in the context of the current phenomenon of urban sprawl witnessed in India. The implications of such growth patterns of India are projected and the impacts analyzed. In conclusion, the need for an alternative sustainable urban development pattern is outlined for future metropolitan cities of India.",

     "abstract": "Studies were carried out using Display Energy Certificate (DEC) data for university buildings to investigate building parameters as determinants of energy use. A preliminary statistical analysis was conducted of annual electricity and heating fuel consumption across a UK-wide dataset focusing on building activity and internal environment. Using data for London university buildings only, a pilot study was also undertaken to assess the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) method for analysing a wider range of energy use determinants.For University Occupier Buildings (UOB) it was found that generally electricity use is high and heating fuel use is low relative to the CIBSE TM46 benchmarks for the University campus category. For the London university dataset there was appreciable variation in energy use between different university-specific building activities. Activity was also shown to have a high ANN causal strength together with material, environment and glazing type.Prediction performance of the ANN improved with the addition of building parameters: for electricity use the ANN mean absolute percentage error reduced to 34%, a 30% reduction relative to a theoretical benchmark-based approach; for heating fuel use it reduced to 25%, a 49% reduction against the benchmark-based approach. Prediction performance appeared to be restricted however, perhaps owing to the limited number of training patterns.From the pilot study the ANN methodology appears to be viable for use in analysing building energy use determinants. A broader follow-up study is planned accordingly and various measures to develop the ANN methodology are presented.",

     "abstract": "This paper investigates the two different types of naturally occurring construction sands in Qatar (fluvial and aeolian dune). These sands are mined from natural deposits that consist of various layers formed at different geological times. After mining, sand treatment plants further process the various layers to be sold commercially for concrete and mortar applications. The booming construction industry in Qatar is only allowed to utilise the locally mined sands which are limited in quantity and are in high demand. Properties of these sands were hardly ever systematically published. This study aims at an initial characterisation and comparison of these sands, augmented by linking sand characteristics to geological processes.Representative fluvial and aeolian sand samples were collected from natural deposits in the south of Qatar and compared to the standard European Norm sand. A rigorous testing program was carried out, comprising of geological, physical, chemical and microstructure investigations. Results were bench marked against the prevalent Qatar Construction Standards specified properties and showed compliance with the thresholds apart from sulphate contents for fluvial sand.In conclusion, Qatar sands consist of high percentages of carbonates and traces of clay minerals and their properties strongly vary with geological layers. In contrast, European Norm sand purely consists of quartz. Thus, selective mining is recommended as a means to upgrade the quality of sand in Qatar. Hence, it is recommended to extract fluvial sand from Channel and Sand Bar geological layers while avoiding mining from abandonment paleosol layers. For aeolian dune sand, selective mining from top layers of deposits while avoiding base layers close to the sulphate and carbonate rich Sabkha is suggested.",

Such technologies are sought to provide energy savings or other environmental benefits for space conditioning, water heating and refrigeration for domestic use. These alternative technologies include: thermoacoustic refrigeration, thermoelectric refrigeration, thermotunneling, magnetic refrigeration, Stirling cycle refrigeration, pulse tube refrigeration, Malone cycle refrigeration, absorption refrigeration, adsorption refrigeration, and compressor driven metal hydride heat pumps. Furthermore, heat pump water heating and integrated heat pump systems are also discussed due to their significant energy saving potential for water heating and space conditioning in households. The paper provides a snapshot of the future R&D needs for each of the technologies along with the associated barriers. Both thermoelectric and magnetic technologies look relatively attractive due to recent developments in the materials and prototypes being manufactured.",

     "abstract": "This paper discusses a model for, user oriented selection of bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor for Jaipur city in GIS environment. The objective of the model is to select the BRT corridor based on spatial distribution of transit trips in the city for horizon year. The model uses the demographic, transit trip and land use characteristics of the city to identify the high ridership oriented BRT corridor. The methodology comprises of two models, first model deals with BRT transit demand forecasting and second model is responsible for selection of the BRT corridor based on some pre-defined conditions. The model generates graphical GIS based maps as output for the better understanding of the transit demand pattern and policy making, for the urban planners. The methodology can be utilized for any similar size cities in Indian context for mass transit planning effectively.",

     "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the comfort conditions of Pharmaceutical Laboratories in Malaysia. Four laboratories were selected as investigation sites. The Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system of the laboratories must be designed for providing good indoor air quality (IAQ) to the workers in the laboratory and keeping the expensive equipment in good condition. For the investigations, a number of measurement equipments were used to obtain the IAQ data of the laboratories (i.e. dry bulb temperature, air humidity, air flow velocity, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, etc.). Some random subjective assessments on the workers in the laboratories were made to acquire information on the workers such as their thermal comfort rating, activity level and their clothing conditions. In this study, air temperature for Laboratories 1, 3 and 4, are 22.38, 20.53 and 19.50\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, slightly below the ASHRAE recommended air temperature. Besides, the total volatile organic compound (TVOC) for Laboratories 2 and 3 shows high TVOC concentration in the wash room and chemical room, which are 22.8 and 6.5\u00a0ppm, respectively. The study in terms of thermal satisfaction indicates an average performance of the air-conditioning system exists in the Pharmaceutical Laboratories.",

     "abstract": "The next generation of advanced fenestration products includes dynamic electrochromic (EC) windows which can modulate the solar energy entering a building by application of an applied voltage. The windows can be switched from 62% visible transmittance (Tvis), 0.47 solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) to a fully tinted state with \u2a7d2% Tvis, 0.09 SHGC. EC windows save energy in buildings \u2013 the total energy use for an eight story ASHRAE 90.1 2007 commercial office building with EC windows was modeled using the eQuest building simulation program and compared with the energy use of the same building with a variety of static glazings. The simulations were carried out in three US climate zones, encompassing a broad range of environmental exposure conditions from hot and dry (Arizona) to very cold (Minnesota). For all climate zones, building energy savings with EC glass were \u2a7e45% when compared to single pane static glazings common in existing building stock. When EC glass was compared to ASHRAE 90.1 2007 code compliant glazings, energy savings greater than 20% were calculated for the same building configuration. Optimum EC window control and performance strategies were derived from the modeling results. The EC glass and dimmable electric lights were synergistically controlled to maximize the use of natural daylighting and minimize electricity for lighting. Since EC glass can tint to \u2a7d2%, shades and/or blinds are not required for glare reduction, and building occupants always have a comfortable working environment and an unobstructed view and connection to the outdoors. All static glazing systems were assumed to have manual shading devices that are pulled by building occupants when glare becomes uncomfortable. For integrated building control systems, the peak load is significantly reduced when dynamic glazings are part of the building envelope. Consequently, chiller costs are lower, and the upfront capital costs for new building construction are reduced. Another key benefit of EC glass, elucidated by the simulations is reduction of CO2 emissions. EC glass reduces peak load carbon emissions by as much as 35% in new construction and 50% in renovation projects.",
