     "abstract": "Compressed fluids were used in a two-step scheme to extract oil from rapeseed and sunflower spent bleaching earths. The first extraction, performed with CO2 at 45\u2009\u00b0C, 23\u2009MPa, yielded matrices depleted in neutral lipids (contents of 1% and 3.5% compared to initial 22% and 28%) and of better flowing characteristics thanks to the downsizing of particle (83% of particles had sizes below 50 \u03bcm). The second step was assisted by ethanol used either as a compressed liquid, as a co-solvent or as a CO2-expanded mixture by changing temperature (35\u00b0, 60\u2009\u00b0C) pressure (6, 18\u2009MPa) and ethanol percentage (10\u2013100\u2009wt%). A statistical analysis concluded that extraction yield and oligomers percentage were dependent on pressure, ethanol percentage and their interaction, whilst temperature was a significant factor only for yield. The pigments content of oils produced by CO2 and extracts produced by pressurized ethanol was below 5 \u03bcg/goil and 32\u2009mg/gextract.",

The resulting homopolymers are highly soluble in supercritical carbon dioxide. Solubility of copolymers is decreased with increase in hydroxyethyl methacrylate content. Simultaneous deposition of copolymers with diisocyanate crosslinking agents from supercritical carbon dioxide solutions allows one to obtain uniform coating of individual fibers of cotton/polyester fabrics.

The results confirm the effectiveness of the high degree of supersaturation achieved in decreasing the cell size and increasing the cell nucleation density of foams. Moreover, it was revealed that the cell size and the cell nucleation density do not always vary as expected as the saturation pressure is increased at the decompression rate and the saturation temperature conditions used in this work.",

A mathematical model for oil extraction from microalgae, including also the adsorption on microalgal surfaces, was extended for this purpose. The working hypothesis was that the extraction process is primarily controlled by phase equilibrium where the solubility of carotenoids in scCO2, as minor components, depends on the solubility of the major component \u2013 microalgal triglycerides. The above assumption was supported and confirmed by the results of the modelling of the vapor-liquid phase equilibria of the system carotenoid\u202f+\u202foil\u202f+\u202fscCO2, which was performed applying the predictive Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013Kwong cubic equation of state.

Films were characterized for structural, mechanical, physico-chemical, optical and functional properties. The use of 0.1\u2009g CNFs/g starch showed 12.7 times improved tensile strength compared to the film without CNFs. Because of the hydrophobic CNFs, films improved moisture resistance with a reduction of water vapor permeability and film solubility in water. Moreover, ester linkages and hydrogen bonds between starch, chitosan, cellulose, and gallic acid were confirmed by FT-IR spectra, reducing free gallic acid release from the film. CNFs are promising fillers to starch-based films to improve tensile strength and moisture barrier properties.",

The flow and heat transfer characteristics of the SCO2 in the UCPHE are investigated numerically by means of SST k-\u03c9 turbulence model. The study shows that the buoyancy effect has weak effect on heat transfer due to the insignificant variation in the thermo-physical properties of the SCO2 under the high temperature condition. The turbulent kinetic energy and the intensity of secondary flow reach the maximal value near the pseudo-critical point due to the significant buoyancy effect, resulting in the heat transfer enhancement. The performance evaluation of the UCPHE via Nu/f1/3 is implemented and its optimum geometry is proposed. The study concludes that the UCPHE has a better comprehensive performance than the Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger (PCHE) within the range of the Reynolds number from 3000 to 35,000.",

     "abstract": "The numerical investigations of zigzag channel showed that the reduction of the zigzag bend angle improves heat transfer performance but worsens hydraulic performance. The heat transfer enhancement has much to do with the decrease of the entropy generation and the increase of the synergy between the velocity and the temperature gradient. The larger heat effectiveness corresponds to better convective heat transfer effectiveness, and a very small heat capacity ratio could lead to slight reduction of the heat effectiveness. The reverse flow boosts the field synergy and diminishes the heat transfer entropy generation, and the secondary flow would improve the synergy between the velocity and temperature gradient in zigzag channels as well as enlarges the entropy generation near the wall. The zigzag channels with the bend angles between 110\u00b0 to 130\u00b0 show the best comprehensive performance in terms of both the first and second laws of thermodynamics.",

The temperature dependence of the CO2 yield has a minimum within the range of 703\u2013748\u2009K that results from the superposition of two following processes: exhaustion of O-containing groups in lignin, and acceleration of the steam reforming and water gas shift reactions with increasing temperature. The latter is indicated by a sharp increase in the yield of H2 at T > 748\u2009K. The maximum yield of phenols is observed at 658\u2013703\u2009K.

     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "Although there are many interests to use proteins in supercritical CO2, protein destabilization in this solvent is the major drawback. This is because of the non-natural CO2 environment which imposes essential instability on the protein structure. Due to the limitations of the experimental techniques to obtain in situ molecular levels information about protein microstructure at high pressures of the supercritical state, the molecular level reasons of the protein destabilization remains controversial and relatively unknown in supercritical CO2. While there is a consensus about the probable roles of surface lysine residues in destabilization of proteins in supercritical CO2, no clear mechanism is presented about the way that these amino acids impose instabilities on the protein conformation. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we extensively examined the structural behavior of the surface lysine residues of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 as a model protein in supercritical CO2. In this way, a new molecular mechanism is proposed which states that the inappropriate interactions of polar side chain of lysine residues with the non-polar nature of supercritical CO2 enforce these exposed residues to return from the solvent bulk to the protein exterior and also to form new non-native hydrogen bonds with the acidic residues such as glutamic acid. This induces some surface regions to be very labile and dynamics. These regions are the starting sequence in the process of protein denaturation in supercritical CO2. Denaturation is extended by collapsing the structure due to the formation of multiple non-native interactions between different residues. To evaluate the proposed mechanism, surface exposed lysine residues were replaced to leucine amino acids with the hydrophobic side chains. Interestingly, the protein remains intact by this replacement even at 200\u2009bar in supercritical CO2. However, replacing of lysine residues by negatively charged glutamic acid and also by glycine residues cannot prevent protein denaturation process. These molecular levels explorations not only address some unknown aspects of protein denaturation mechanism in supercritical CO2, but it also can essentially help to design new CO2-tolerant proteins which can be used in popular processes such as biocatalysis in supercritical CO2.",

The conditions of high temperature and pressure tested turn the CO2 into supercritical conditions, so the differences when the fluidizing agent is at supercritical conditions are also tested. The results show that when pressure and temperature are increased, fluidization with air or CO2 shifts from the typical bubbling fluidization characteristic of ambient conditions, to a more homogeneous fluidization where not only bubbles and dense phase are present in the bed, but also a dilute phase of moderate solids concentration. The main consequence is an increase of the lateral motion of gas and solids at high pressure and temperature. A deviation from the classical Two-phase theory occurs because the gas velocity through the dense phase at high pressure and temperature is higher than the corresponding minimum fluidization velocity.",

In this study, three imaging techniques were used to evaluate the S\u2212CO2-induced micro-structural alterations in heterogeneous coal specimens. Results from the qualitative analysis indicate that S\u2212CO2 interaction causes new fracture formation and extension/widening of existing fractures in coal. Quantitative analysis concludes that fracture fraction and fracture-matrix interface area increase linearly with S\u2212CO2 interaction time. Spatial disposition of mineral/maceral phases at specific arrangements significantly affects the induced fracture geometry, where most of the fractures form at mineral-maceral interfaces, parallel to mineral layering.

     "abstract": "This work studied the effect of pelletization on the SuperCritical (SC) carbon dioxide (CO2) extraction yield of rosemary antioxidant fractions enriched in phenolic compounds. Dried rosemary leaves were depleted of essential oils by SC-CO2 extraction and a portion of the resulting pre-extracted leaves (control substrate) enriched in phenolic compounds was pelletized. A factorial experimental design (23) was carried out: control substrate and pellets were extracted at two temperatures (40 and 70\u202f\u00b0C), and two extraction pressures (30 and 50\u202fMPa). Pelletizing decreased the extraction yield from 4.28% to 1.33%. However, the volumetric yield (mass of recovered solute per unit time and per unit volume of extraction bed) of pellets was 34% higher than that of control substrate. Pelletization also decreased the antioxidant activity of the extracts, which was attributed to the high temperatures generated during the process. A linear correlation (R2\u202f=\u202f0.83) between the antioxidant activity and the dominant rosemary phenolic carnosic acid was observed. Sovov\u00e1\u2019s broken-and-intact cell model was applied to a selection of pellet and control substrate extraction curves to determine a microstructural factor (MF\u202f=\u202fDe/D12) as best-fitting parameter. Resulting value of MF was 0.0003 for control substrate and 0.0027 for pellets. The simulation of the SC-CO2 extraction of pellets with twice the specific surface showed that a decrease of particle size can increase considerably the extraction rate and yield of the pellets. We propose pelletization, under certain restrictions of particle size and process temperature, as a way of improving rosemary antioxidant extraction yield.",

The GCA-EOS is used to predict the thermodynamic properties and phase equilibrium compositions. We select n-decane, n-triacontane, benzene, naphthalene and 1-decylnaphthalene as representative hydrocarbons. Our simulations show delayed mixing processes as the temperature approaches the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) of the mixture, consistent with the impact of non-ideal diffusional driving forces evaluated from pure thermodynamic calculations. Results also show that the phase behavior notably affects the non-ideal driving forces near the UCST, which confirms the importance of coupling accurate thermodynamic models in predictive mixing studies.",

Pressure was found to have the greatest effect on dewatering compared to initial-pressure-hold-time, pressure-release-time or temperature. The fundamental capillary tube model adequately predicted dewatering provided empirical tortuosity and porosity information was incorporated into the diffusion coefficient as a lumped parameter. The findings provide a predictive dewatering model that is applicable to porous materials in general, and provides insight into the removal of water from ceramics and wood at a fundamental level.",

It appears that stacking of aromatic rings is the key factor in viscosity enhancement. The results showed that viscosity of the solution increases with the increasing content of the aromatic acrylate unit in the copolymer, but a point is reached beyond which additional comonomer causes the relative viscosity to drop, suggesting that the aromatic rings associate through intramolecular rather than intermolecular interactions beyond the optimum value. The most effective CO2 thickener identified in this study was the 29% phenyl acrylate-71% fluoroacrylate copolymer. However, the presence of a spacer (methyl or ethyl) between the backbone and the aromatic group substantially diminished the viscosity enhancement.",

Thus, introducing a modelling-based solution to deliver accurate dielectric property values for materials at supercritical conditions for \u201ca priori\u201d screening of solvents, whilst removing the need to overcome engineering and safety challenges associated with the development of experimental equipment to practically generate such data.",

Conventional methods for the production of liposomes are characterized by several drawbacks such as low encapsulation efficiencies, difficult control of particle size distribution, high solvent residue and necessity of expensive post-processing steps. To overcome these limitations, SuperLip (Supercritical assisted Liposome formation) has been developed, consisting in the inversion of the traditional liposome production steps: water droplets are obtained; then, lipidic layer is formed around them.Nanometric and sub-micrometric vesicles were obtained entrapping proteins, antibodies, antibiotics, essential oils, agricultural additives, antioxidants, dyes and hollow gold nanoparticles. The continuity of the process guaranteed reproducible production of liposome suspensions, whose bulk stability was confirmed for at least 6 months. After process parameters optimization, encapsulation efficiencies up to 99% were obtained.",

Multi-component fuel-air mixing is simulated by considering a diffused interface approximation. The thermodynamic properties are predicted using the Perturbed Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) real-fluid equation of state (EoS). This molecular-based EoS requires three empirically determined but well-known parameters to model the properties of a specific component, and thus, there is no need for extensive model calibration, as is typically the case when the NIST library is utilised. Moreover, PC-SAFT can handle flexibly the thermodynamic properties of multi-component mixtures, which is an advantage compared to the NIST library, where only limited component combinations are supported. This has allowed for the properties of Diesel fuel to be modelled as surrogates comprising four, five, eight and nine components. The proposed numerical approach improves the overall computational time and overcomes the previously observed spurious pressure oscillations associated with the utilization of conservative schemes. In the absence of experimental data, advection test cases and shock tube problems are included to validate the developed framework. Finally, two-dimensional simulations of planar jets of n-dodecane and a four component Diesel surrogate are included to demonstrate the capability of the developed methodology to predict supercritical Diesel fuel mixing into air.",

     "abstract": "MD simulations using flexible models were performed to show how velocity autocorrelation functions, diffusion (DOH) and self-diffusion (Dw) coefficients, continuous and intermittent lifetimes of H-donor and H-acceptor bonds depend on: i) transformations in the hydrogen-bond network (HBN) of water below the critical point, and ii) decreasing density at the supercritical isotherm (\u223c670\u2009K). Contrary to simulations neglecting short-range hydrogen-oxygen interactions, we show that complexation of OHaq with H2O is enhanced by breakage of the continuous HBN, resulting in the increase of OHaq hydrodynamic radius and the DOH values smaller than Dw by 30%. Difference between DOH and Dw increases to 65% at 670\u2009K below the critical density. It is explained by enhanced aggregation of water molecules around OHaq, earlier recognized as the self-trapping mechanism. Except near-ambient conditions, the intermittent lifetime of H-bonds is longer than the translational time, indicating that OHaq is complexed with water and moves as a molecular aggregate.",

The results showed that at the temperature when crystals were nearly melted, the foam had an ultra-high expansion ratio of 45.

When a mass load of 0.086\u2009g/cm3 was used, ultrasound effect was not observed, due to sample swelling and compaction within the cell. For 0.043\u2009g/cm3, the intensification effect of ultrasound was significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and its magnitude depended on the transducer geometry. For a multiplate transducer geometry, antioxidant capacity increased from 12.18\u2009\u00b1\u20091.01 to 20.91\u2009\u00b1\u20091.66\u2009\u03bcmol TE/g; and saponins from 19.05\u2009\u00b1\u20091.67 to 61.59\u2009\u00b1\u20091.99\u2009\u03bcg/g, when ultrasound was applied. Although the amount of bioactives extracted is low, the use of a multiplate transducer design was able to intensify the supercritical fluid extraction of phytochemicals from agave bagasse. Consequently, this type of transducer can become an alternative for the application of ultrasound on the supercritical fluid extraction of other suitable agro-industrial by-products.",

When the ion-exchange resin (Amberlyst 70) was used as the catalyst, furfural extraction with toluene effectively increased the yield relative to that of the reaction in water alone. The furfural yield obtained with the water/CO2 batch system was lower than that with the biphasic water/toluene system because the solubility of furfural in supercritical CO2 was lower than that in toluene. The furfural yield was increased by using a semibatch reactor system with continuous CO2 flow.

A promising way of drying scCO2 is by using H2O permeable membranes. Ideally, these membranes demonstrate low CO2 permeability. Here, we investigated the CO2 permeability of three types of dense membranes, Nafion, Natural Rubber and PDMS, of which the latter in more detail because of its ease of handling. The experimental conditions, temperature and pressure, resulting in minimum CO2 permeability (=losses) were explored. Even though the absolute CO2 permeability depends on the intrinsic membrane material properties, its trend with increasing feed pressure is defined by the (supercritical) behavior of CO2, notably its density as a function of temperature and pressure. The data points to transitions within the supercritical regime, from the gaseous-like supercritical state to the liquid-like supercritical state, graphically visualized by the Widom line for CO2 density. Sorption measurements with PDMS membranes confirm this behavior that follows the diffusion-solution theory. In the gaseous state, the (normalized) permeability follows the (normalized) solubility, indicating a constant CO2 diffusivity. With increasing pressure and when entering the liquid-like (supercritical) regime, the diffusivity drops, resulting in a (normalized) permeability that starts to lag behind the (normalized) solubility.",

Biodiesel is a sustainable alternative to petroleum diesel; hence, its efficient production is of significant importance. The transesterification of triolein with methanol under supercritical conditions in the presence of a solid catalyst structured as packed beds is of particular interest due to high yields at moderate temperatures and continuous operability. Fundamental understanding of the heat and mass transfer phenomena in a supercritical transesterification reaction is paramount for a better modelling of the reaction.Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were used to study, by means of a simplified numerical model, heat and mass transport phenomena in a supercritical transesterification reactor. The CFD model was built replicating an experimental pilot plant reactor. Simulations were performed for a 3D geometrical model of a packed bed of cylindrical catalysts. Wall-to-fluid and particle-to-fluid heat and mass transfer were studied for a fluid mixture of methanol (CH3OH) and triolein (C57H104O6) along with co-solvent carbon dioxide (CO2), flown into the packed bed under supercritical conditions (25\u2009MPa, 473.15\u2009K). Detailed flow, temperature and concentration profiles in packed bed were obtained. Free and forced convection effects for different flow rates were analyzed. Large density gradients were observed near the packed bed inlet, generating hydrodynamic instabilities due to natural convection as observed in Metais-Eckert maps. Heat and mass transfer coefficients were estimated from CFD data, and the obtained values of Nuw, Nup, Shp were compared against empirical models for different flow rates for validation of the CFD data. The simulation data agreed well with empirical correlationsfor predicting transport coefficients.",

Using scCO2/glycerol the reaction reached 77% of conversion in 6\u2009h, and the enantiopure (S)-ethyl-3-hydroxybutyrate (enantiomeric excess > 99%) was observed as the unique product. The same reaction under normal conditions led to only 12% conversion in 6\u2009h.

Then, to bring the FASTSUGARS process closer to industrial applications, the particle size of the biomass was increased in the pilot plant. It was found that the particle size acted as a mass transfer resistance, slowing down the hydrolysis of biomass, providing lower conversion and therefore reducing sugars\u2019 degradation (degradation yield was lower than 15% in the pilot plant). In that way, higher selectivity to sugars was obtained, reaching values around 90% for both sugar beet pulp and wheat bran in the pilot plant.",

Enzymes from these fungi, e.g. amylases, cellulases, lipases, and proteases, which possess so called polyextremophilicity (they are thermostable, tolerant to a wide range of pH, less susceptible to denaturation and tolerant to high salt concentrations) present a novel catalytic alternative for biotechnological applications. To release enzymes from halophilic fungi cells, a conventional method using mechanical homogenizer (rotor-stator homogenizer) and a novel method using supercritical technology were applied. Very high protein concentration in all halophilic fungi cell suspensions after the treatment with SC CO2 were detected. Obtained results also show very high activities of protease, \u03b1-amylase, \u03b2-glucosidase and cellulase after the treatment of each halophilic fungi cell suspension by SC CO2. Using SC CO2 as a medium for cell disruption offers additional benefits regarding performance of a biochemical reaction and bioseparation in the same medium leading in integration of all three processes into a single step. Besides, integration of processes presents important advantage in industrial processes from an economic point of view. Enzymes from extremophiles namely possess improved properties and can be used at harsh conditions where non-extremophilic enzymes may deactivate.

The hybrid beads were characterized through laser diffraction, BET and SAXS. Small particles (average diameter\u202f=\u202f282 \u03bcm) with high specific surface area (more than 900\u202fm2/g) and quite stable structural properties were obtained. Preliminary tests were performed to investigate how different kinds of coatings (alginate/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, silica/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or hydrophobic silica coating) affected the loading and release rate of model-drug ketoprofen. Among all results, uncoated hybrid aerogel beads resulted in burst release with 90% of the initial loaded drug delivered after 3\u202fmin while release was prolonged up to 60\u202fmin when a hydrophobic silica coating was used.",

Conventional approaches typically require high-energy mixing to generate the miniemulsion and this impedes their industrial application. Compressed ethane is employed in this study to generate oil-in-water (mini)emulsions based on styrene/water and the anionic surfactant Dowfax 8390. The initial, turbid emulsion becomes transparent under compressed ethane at 60\u202f\u00b0C and 6\u202fMPa. Aqueous heterogeneous radical polymerization of styrene at these conditions yields nanoparticles with diameters of around 60\u202fnm. However, mechanistic investigations reveal that particle formation proceeds via a classical emulsion polymerization mechanism (aqueous micellar nucleation) rather than direct polymerization of monomer droplets (droplet nucleation). The transparency phenomenon is attributed to matching refractive indices in the continuous and dispersed phases. The Lorentz-Lorenz mixing rule is used to estimate both the refractive index and ethane solubility in the dispersed phase at the transparent condition.",

The microstructure of the coating or matrix is characterized by optical microscopy, Spectroscopy Electron Microscopy and Electron Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The influence of the main experimental parameters (temperature, pressure, residence time) is studied on the chemical composition of the ceramic deposits.

The extraction plant was designed in-house, built and commissioned to work up to 1390\u202fbar. The goal of this work was to study seed oil extraction and solubility under ultra-high extraction pressures. Apple seeds were extracted using supercritical carbon dioxide at 300, 500, 750, 1000 and 1300\u202fbar, and at temperatures of 316, 326 and 336\u202fK. The apparent solubility at each condition was determined from the constant rate extraction period observed in the extraction experiments. Under ultra-high pressure (1300\u202fbar) and moderate temperature (336\u202fK) experimental conditions, the maximum solubility achieved was \u223c191\u202fg extract/kg CO2 compared with \u223c10\u202fg extract/kg CO2 at commonly used extraction pressures of 300\u202fbar. Apple seed oil is a highly valued natural skincare ingredient. The oil composition was determined in terms of fatty acid profile, water, polyphenol, cyanogen and tocopherol content. The seed residue after extraction was also analyzed for polyphenol and cyanogen content and was examined by SEM to establish the effects of extraction on residual seed structure. Complete extraction of tocopherols occurred at high pressure (\u2265750\u202fbar) and moderate extraction temperature (\u2264326\u202fK). The levels of polyphenols and cyanogens in the extracted oil were negligible to extremely low. Low concentrations of cyanogens make the seed oil potentially suitable for human consumption. The seed residue contained a polyphenol-rich fraction that could be extracted by solvent extraction and used in other products.",

The CO2 was made to continuously flow over this. The TCA removal was compared at different operating conditions (pressure, temperature, flow rate or extraction time). TCA removal was not possible in dried cork. Density had a positive impact in TCA removal due to the solvent capacity increase. An increase in the supercritical fluid temperature over 60\u202f\u00b0C impaired the TCA extraction. High residence times benefited the extraction. At high CO2 density of 585\u202fkg\u202fm\u22123, TCA elimination below the detection level was achieved in 8\u202fmin residence time.

Two model reactions were used to elucidate the effects of water properties on catalysis and their variation with the catalysts. The kinetics of both reactions obeyed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, and the competitive adsorption of water suppressed these reactions. An increase in the ion product of water with increasing water density promoted these reactions, particularly with TiO2 and Nb2O5. In addition, temperature-programmed desorption suggested that active sites with weaker affinity for water are mainly active in supercritical water, wherein Nb2O5 shows Br\u00f8nsted acidity, NbOX/TiO2 shows Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acidity, and TiO2 tends to show Lewis acidity.

Favorable non-aqueous HBD-HBA solvent-pairs in some of the applications are ethanol-ethyl acetate, ethanol-acetone and ethanol-acetonitrile. Water-alcohol and water-lactone solvent-pairs are useful when aqueous mixtures are required.

Hydrogen is a promising material for chemical storage, but storage of hydrogen is a challenging task as requirements of storage capacity, release kinetics and weight must be met. Extensive research on solid hydrogen storage materials has been carried out in order to accomplish these objectives. Metallic and chemical hydrides are among the most promising storage materials, but they are still limited by thermodynamic and kinetic properties.

This allows the treatment of high concentrated waste without exceeding temperature safety limits. In order to compare the performance of a double-shelled reactor with a conventional one, both reactors were built at laboratory scale.

The goal is to address the capability of the equation to predict the global behaviour of these mixtures, with emphasis in accurately reproducing their mechanisms and topology.

Finally, excess volume, excess compressibilities as well as excess speed of sound were estimated and represented as a function of CO2 content.

     "abstract": "The present paper aims to enhance the awareness of users of thermodynamic models on the impact that their accuracy may have in designing and operating units for the purification and compression of CO2-streams produced from capture technologies. After providing a review on the composition of streams produced by coal- or gas-fired plants with post-/pre-/oxy-combustion CO2 capture, coupled with different purification technologies, the paper quantifies the influence of equations of state accuracy in designing and operating CO2 purification and compression units. A comparison is made between the results obtained from the cubic Peng-Robinson model combined with either classical vdW1f (van der Waals one fluid) mixing rules (i.e. the standard Peng-Robinson equation of state) or with recently optimized advanced mixing rules incorporating residual-excess-Helmholtz-energy ( a res E, \u03b3 ) models ( EoS / a res E, \u03b3 mixing rules). In detail, EoS / a res E, \u03b3 mixing rules combine the residual contribution of the Wilson a E , \u03b3 model and the formulation proposed by Lorentz, for the mixture co-volume term. It is shown that the improved accuracy of \u201cPR + EoS / a res E, \u03b3 mixing rules\u201d in the representation of vapour-liquid equilibrium properties of CCS mixtures, with respect to the standard PR EoS, may lead to the design of a halved-height stripping column for the reduction of the oxygen content in the captured CO2 stream. Moreover, the paper shows the effect of the applied thermodynamic model on the definition of the pressurization level of the captured fluid and on the computed power required for its compression.",

In the new design, coolant and moderator circuits are separated and nanofluid has been used as coolant of the reactor core. In the performed sub-channel analysis, the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy are solved numerically. Since in the new geometry the coolant and moderator circuits are separated, compared to previous plans, using the nanofluids with higher mass fraction of nanoparticles is applicable. In this article, the thermal-hydraulic analysis is performed for various mass fractions of Al2O3 nanoparticle and moderator velocities. Calculations show that the core outlet temperature grows up with increasing nanoparticle mass fraction. As it was expected, by increasing the nanoparticle mass fraction the core pressure drop will be raised, but in the proposed design this pressure drop is much lower.",

Different nanocatalysts were synthesized using SCW method and their abilities to destruct the TBP in the aqueous solution were compared in order to pick out the best catalyst for the subsequent experiments. The effect of main operational variables, including reaction temperature, time and pressure, and oxidant concentration was investigated in order to determine optimal conditions. A practical mechanism for catalytic oxidation of TBP in SCW was also proposed based on the results of various analyses. The results demonstrated that among all of the catalysts, CeO2 provided the best result in the oxidation process, by which the TOC removal efficiency was increased by 22% with respect to noncatalytic oxidation. In addition, temperature and pressure showed an influential effect on the TBP decomposition efficiency, while the effect of oxidant can be neglected.",

The catalytic activity of the nickel wire catalyst was investigated. Because of the gradual deactivation of the catalyst, the hydrogen yield decreased by 8\u201372% after five catalytic cycles. The temperature has the largest influence on the deactivation rate of the nickel catalyst. The decline rate of the hydrogen yield decreased from 67% to 8% when the temperature was increased from 400\u202f\u00b0C to 500\u202f\u00b0C. SEM, EDS and TPO were used to characterize the spent catalyst. The results showed that the deactivation of the nickel catalyst is caused by the deposition of char/coke on the catalyst surface.

The results show that for s\u202f=\u202f0.5 and 0.35 side jets form whereas no side jets are observed for s\u202f=\u202f1; thus providing, for the first time, evidence of side jet formation in high-p flows. Due to these side jets, mixing of the jet fluid and chamber fluid is promoted; although the species experience regular diffusional mixing, it is shown that due to turbulent conditions there can be effective uphill thermal conduction. Analysis of the vortical features of the side jets elucidated the process through which the enhanced mixing occurs: fluid from the jet is effectively pumped in the radial direction though the combined action of dilatation/compression and vortex stretching/shrinking. The value of s is shown to control radial and circumferential mixing versus axial mixing which occurs through jet penetration in the flow. Examination of dynamic and thermodynamic quantities indicates that side jets also promote flow unsteadiness. The pressure in the chamber is demonstrated to have negligible effect on the side jets.",

Saturation pressure, and hence phase transition pressure, was determined for 1\u201370\u202fwt% PDMS in CO2 at 313\u2013353\u202fK using the variable volume view cell method (SynVisVar). The density and dynamic viscosity were measured at saturation using the quantified volume and mass, and the converse piezoelectric effect, respectively. In agreement with the literature, the phase equilibria showed complex phase behaviour. Additionally, fluid properties deviated significantly from that of the respective pure components. It was found that both systems exhibited low solubility in CO2 (<1% above 20\u202fMPa), with properties in the desired ranges (\u223c900\u2013800\u202fkg/m3 and \u223c0.7\u20137\u202fmPa.s) for planned future hydrodynamic experiments.",

A firm relationship between bubble nucleation and growth with solubility and diffusivity was observed. The results show that bubble density during the process can be controlled by changing the temperature and the pressure release rate. Furthermore, bubble growth was simulated considering mass diffusion equations and implicit method. The simulation results were in a good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the effects of diffusivity and zero shear viscosity on the bubble growth were investigated and it was found that the bubble growth is a diffusion controlled phenomenon.",

The formation of hydrogen-bonded complexes with two or more cosolvent molecules is most likely in methanol-modified supercritical carbon dioxide even at a low concentration of the methanol, whereas the formation of a complex with one cosolvent molecule is preferred in the acetone-modified fluid. If the cosolvent is capable of self-association in supercritical carbon dioxide (methanol), then hydrogen-bonded cosolvent clusters are grouped around the solvate complexes even at low concentration of it. The number of molecules in such clusters can reach 10, although methanol associates consist of no more than three molecules in the fluid bulk.",

By comparing the molar fractions between binary mixtures and ternary mixtures, it is found that the addition of CO2 can significantly reduce the methane solubility, but enhance the propane/n-heptane/n-decane solubility in aqueous phase (i.e., water-rich phase), while addition of methane can greatly reduce the CO2 dissolution in aqueous phase. Such an effect for methane-CO2-water mixtures is closely related to the molar fraction of methane (i.e., the ratio of the molar fraction of methane to that of methane\u202f+\u202fCO2 in feed). The addition of CO2 can significantly enhance the water dissolution in alkane-rich phase.

The photocatalytic activity of titanium oxide synthesized using TEO was higher than that of the commercial titanium oxide P25. The high concentration of TEO precursor in supercritical sol-gel reaction can increase the photocatalytic degradation rate constant of methylene blue in aqueous solutions. Supercritical sol-gel reaction achieved high negative surface charge of the titanium oxide in aqueous solutions, and consequently becomes highly-dispersed. The high dispersion of titanium oxide in aqueous solution results in a large surface area that promotes dye adsorption and photocatalytic degradation.",

The results revealed that in a water-saturated supercritical CO2-SO2-NO2-O2 environment, the average maximum pitting depth stabilized after three days, which indicated that pits were unstable and cannot rapidly propagate with time while also implying that a local acidification process might not exist. The product accumulation in the pit cavities can eventually prevent the diffusion of the corrosive media and water from the product surface to the metal substrate. The effect of flow on the propagation of pits was marginal, revealing the weak influence of flow on the mass transfer of species through the product scales. The formation of spherical products was possibly attributed to the influence of NO2 on the contact angle of water droplets on the steel surface.",

To assess the overall reaction kinetics, a novel analytical scheme exploiting micro/macrocavities and flow/closed reactors was developed. Two reaction paths were thereby revealed: surface reaction of the precursor and consecutive reactions starting from homogeneous reactions of the precursor in the fluid (fluid-phase reaction), followed by the surface reaction of the intermediate species. Compared with the original TiO2-SCFD, methanol addition enhanced the surface reaction rate constant and thus growth rate, although the step coverage was slightly deteriorated. Nevertheless, it still had good step coverage on the high-aspect-ratio features (e.g., a step coverage of 85% on a trench with an AR of 50). Methanol addition is an effective way to promote the growth rate insofar as conformal deposition has been ensured on the targeted structure.",

The Reynold number monotonically increased with the augment of bulk fluid temperature, however, the Prandtl number exhibited both peak and trough values. Compared with mass fluxes, operating pressures had less influence on the heat transfer performances. Moreover, the flow stratification phenomenon and lateral secondary flows were developed as a result of the combined interaction of buoyancy and gravity.

     "abstract": "It is presented a technical and economic analysis of ammonia borane confined in silica aerogel using carbon dioxide at subcritical conditions. The process was simulated in Aspen Plus software and an economic analysis was carried. The results showed that it is possible to produce 4795\u202fkg/year of products with a total investment of 1.32 MUSD and a cost of manufacturing per mass of product of 183 USD/kg fixing the ageing time to 5\u202fdays. The results indicated that microparticles residence time is a restrictive factor of the process as it limits the number of process cycles in a year. According to new experiments, it is possible to reduce time from 5\u202fdays to 2\u202fdays. This implies the decrease in the cost of manufacturing to 87 USD/Kg with the same total initial investment and a rise in the annual productivity to almost 12\u202ft/year.",

Characterization of prepared materials revealed a noticeable development of porosity with apparent surfaces areas up to 320\u202fm2/g. A highlighting variety of functional acid groups especially sensitive to air supply time was confirmed by surface chemistry analysis.

The internal mass transfer coefficients were computed for both extracts and solanesol at various experimental conditions. The extraction rate of solanesol was found higher than that of tobacco extract, indicating that shorter extraction time resulted in higher selectivity of solanesol. Furthermore, a pretreatment with a solvent of n-hexane:95% ethanol at 4:6 volumetric ratio was tried at a selected experimental condition to improve the selectivity of solanesol. A final product with solanesol content of 0.44 was obtained. Consequently, this study provides a new route for generating solanesol from industrial tobacco waste.",

The non-asymptotic critical anomalies of the isothermal compressibility, the thermal expansion coefficient and the heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume were determined in the 0.80Tc\u20131.20Tc temperature range along the 1.00Pc and 1.15Pc isobars. A single-site united-atom model and a two-site rigid rotor force fields were used in the simulations. The results show that effective force fields developed to describe accurately the behavior of liquids and dense gases in general can be used to obtain near-critical anomalies of the thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the computed values are in very good agreement with NIST data when available. The results fill existing gaps of the NIST database in the near-critical vicinity of the critical temperature along the critical isobar, especially for the heat capacities. The MBAR technique was crucial to describe the continuous and sharp peak of each property as functions of the temperature. The results indicated that even with a simple force field such as the united-atom one-site approach, very good results could be obtained for the non-asymptotic critical anomalies of thermodynamic properties without using renormalization group techniques. The computation of accurate results was possible due to the availability of precise critical constants especially for the simpler one-site force field. The inclusion of the anisotropy in the force field does not necessarily improve the computed thermodynamic properties in the near critical region.",

The breakthrough curves obtained with the measurements were correlated by a mathematical kinetic model using only one fitting parameter, the effective diffusion coefficient of Rh(acac)3 in pores (De).

Several experiments with tall soap and black liquor on the hydrothermal gasification apparatus were performed. In this paper, results that permit to compare the influence of different process conditions (residence time, catalyst addition). In addition, practical gasification experiences with real industry waste streams treated in the specific vertical reactor made from stainless steel are presented.

In the second depressurization, a large number of new cells nucleate and grow into the smaller cells, driven by diffusion; meanwhile, after the holding stage, the remaining cells again expand and evolve into the final larger cells, driven by hydrodynamic forces. Based on the above mechanism, increasing the dense of large cells can be achieved by increasing the depressurization degree or reducing the holding time while an introduction of inorganic particle or an enhancement of intermediate pressure is propitious to form denser small cells.",

     "abstract": "Food industry is increasingly interested in replacing conventional processes of plant extraction, as well as microbial inactivation, by alternative, greener and cheaper techniques. In many cases, chemical extraction processes are hindered by several drawbacks such as the use of chemical solvents, which is associated with many health and environmental issues. Furthermore, the use of high temperatures to improve and/or accelerate the processes, which may affect and degrade the thermolabile compounds, is usually required. Among the most promising techniques that could be competitive to the current extraction methods of molecules from plant matrices and microbial inactivation of food products, ultrasound assisted supercritical fluid extraction has taken great interest. This non-exhaustive review, covering the last 20 years, gives a critical commentary on the main published results using this emerging technology. Promising prospects opened up by new applications are described, without omitting the main limitations still to be overcome for a harmonious industrial development of these technologies.",

At high pressures and high temperatures Raman spectroscopy has been an efficient tool for the in situ analysis of mechanisms such as heat transfer, mass transfer, reaction, crystallization, decomposition, condensation, hydrolysis and others. Its future potential is discussed treating three specific example processes; (i) the extraction of valuable compounds from biomass, (ii) the conversion of biomass to platform chemicals and fuels and (iii) the decontamination of wastewaters containing organics. What is discussed for these three example processes can be transferred to other processes that do not have to take place at high temperature and high pressure. A brief introduction into applied Raman spectroscopy is provided in the context of these processes. Then it is described where in these processes the application of Raman spectroscopy can make substantial contributions to the understanding of the processes. Finally, some strategies are mentioned how Raman spectroscopy can be applied to high pressure and high temperature processes.",

The study comprises four different fluid compositions: pure ammonia, ammonia with a ruthenium catalyst, ammonia and mineralizer (sodium azide) and last ammonia, mineralizer and gallium nitride (GaN). By this, it was possible to proof that with pure ammonia and without a proper catalyst the decomposition of ammonia stops quite far before chemical equilibrium is reached.",

This review is divided in four main sections which present the fundamentals of lignocellulosic biomass fractionation in hemicelluloses, cellulose and lignin. As the biomass structure plays an important role, a section to study the extraction of the linked phenols that joint lignin and hemicelluloses is included.",

In order to understand the decomposition behaviors of cell wall components, it is quite important to understand the chemical structure of each cell wall component. Thus, the cell wall structures and its chemical components of lignocellulosics were introduced, and for each component, the decomposition pathway were proposed. Furthermore, among the cell wall components, the lignin was confirmed not to be uniformly distributed within the cell wall. Therefore, an importance of the topochemistry of delignification was discussed.",

Chemical and chemical engineering studies are introduced and sorted into categories, which are the main factors influencing the chemical reaction pathways of SCWG. These are: the components of biomass (carbohydrates, lignin, ash, proteins and lipids), reaction conditions e.g. concentration and the possible addition of heterogeneous catalysts. Most studies focus on model compounds, here the interference of the components in mixtures give a deeper understanding in view of the conversion of real biomass. Also studies with biomass are reported; here in most cases the effect of salts, catalyzing hydrogen formation, is dominating. The progress in knowledge is evaluated in view of the hurdles to overcome for a wide industrial application. Recent paper hints to a future of hydrothermal gasification as part of a bio-refinery and with an internal use of hydrogen produced.",

In the present work, a detailed reactor model for hydrothermal flow-through pretreatment of pelletized wheat straw at 3\u00a0L scale is developed.

In order to maximize the bio-oil yield, design of experiment and optimization was performed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Four factors which included temperature (330\u2013390\u00a0\u00b0C), pressure (25\u201335\u00a0MPa), reaction time (60\u2013120\u00a0min) and biomass-to-water ratio (0.20-0.50\u00a0wt/wt) were investigated. The regression model developed gave accurate predictions and fitted well with the experimental results, with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.9109. Based on the model, the optimum liquefaction condition was predicted to be at temperature of 390\u00a0\u00b0C, pressure of 25\u00a0MPa, reaction time of 60\u00a0min and biomass-to-water ratio of 0.20 with a prediction yield of 15.48\u00a0wt%.

However, some substances without these groups gave significant yields to formic acid so new mechanisms were proposed. Out of all the compounds tested, glucose gave the highest yield to formic acid, probably due to its particular reaction pathways at the studied conditions.

The fluid-specific scaling coefficients are determined by squared-error minimization for triatomic fluids for various thermodynamic states near the critical point. The proposed non-dimensionalization is demonstrated by showing that the temperature and velocity fields, and their respective gradients, of supercritical CO2 flowing inside a heated-wall channel are nearly identical whether the transport equations are solved with the actual equation of state of CO2 or with dimensionless properties scaled from water. Finally, the fluid-specific scaling constants are shown to be determinable by closed-form expressions.",

In the present study, the pomegranate seed oil (PSO) was tested for antioxidant and cytotoxic potential. PSO was extracted by supercritical fluid extraction with previous treatment of seeds by microwaves and analysed for its fatty acid profile, carotenoid and tocopherol contents. PSO demonstrated to be a good source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (83.5%), followed by monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and saturated fatty acid (SFA) (9.5% and 7.0%, respectively). Concerning fatty acid profile, punicic (C18:3), oleic (C18:1) and linoleic (C18:2) acids were the predominant ones. Carotenoids and tocopherols were identified and quantified by HPLC. Results showed that the PSO was a good source of \u03b3- tocopherol as dominant among investigated compounds (128.6\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g).

Results indicate the successful formation of amorphous inclusion complexes. SASD is a clean technology, suitable for processing thermolabile APIs, thus an interesting alternative to conventional spray drying and other methods of CyD solid complex formation.",

     "abstract": "The production of nano and microparticles by means of a supercritical process is a highly promising technique that is commonly applied in the pharmaceutical industry. Even though the industrial application of the technique is not a novelty, understanding the associated physics is still a subject under study. Experimental data and mathematical modeling allied to computational simulation are the principal tools used to manage the knowledge needed to enhance the process yield and obtain a product with the required quality and appropriate physical properties. Therefore, in this study a mathematical model was applied to describe the formation of particles of a grape pomace extract using the supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) process. The model was coupled with a population balance approach applied to determine the precipitation kinetics, and the particle size distribution of the grape pomace extract was experimentally obtained. The model considers steady-state non-isothermal turbulent flow under supercritical conditions, while Peng-Robinson\u2019s Equation of State and Van der Waals mixing rule were the thermodynamic models used. The mathematical model was numerically solved by CFD techniques, and the precipitation kinetics was successfully represented by comparing numerical and experimental data. Also, it was possible to capture the effects of parameters, such as the mass flux ratio between the solute and anti-solvent, as well as the solute concentration, on the particle nucleation and grow the rates underall experimental conditions studied. In general, the numerical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data and effects on the nucleation and growth rates were confirmed.",

In this communication, a supervised technique, namely, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) was employed to estimate the solubility of 33 different drug compounds in supercritical CO2. The corresponding solubility was determined as a function of temperature, pressure, density of supercritical CO2, and two physical properties of drug, i.e. molecular weight and melting point. The results obtained from the employed LSSVM model were compared with eight correlations. The obtained average absolute relative deviation and the square of regression coefficient for the testing group of LSSVM model were found to be 5.61% and 0.9975, respectively. Therefore, the model developed in this work can be reliably applied to the studied drugs by only knowing their physical properties.",

To address this critical issue, we modified the continuous-rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS-C) process, which is incessant, stable and well-regulated. Initially, the solubility of lonidamine (LND) in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) was tested using a static analytical method at altered critical conditions (T: 308.15-328.15\u00a0K, P: 10.0-30.0\u00a0MPa). Under optimized conditions (LND conc.- 0.5% (w/v), flow rate- 1.0\u00a0mL/min, T- 328.15\u00a0K, P- 20.0\u00a0MPa and CO2 flow rate- 30.0\u00a0g/min), the modified RESS-C process resulted in nano-sized spheres with a smooth surface and a narrow particle size distribution. Further, the crystal properties of the samples and their molecular interactions were elucidated. The altered physical state of RESS-C processed LND from crystalline to amorphous resulted in the solubility improvement and also enhanced the in vitro antiproliferative effects compared to the unprocessed LND, demonstrating the potential of the modified RESS-C process in improving the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs.",

The crude oil was upgraded into the light oil with more saturate and less aromatic, resin in scMeOH. The higher the temperature, the faster the asphaltene was converted to coke. In FTIR analysis, scMeOH are presumed to participate in the upgrading of crude oil. To understand the crude oil upgrading process in scMeOH, four lump kinetic model including maltene, asphaltene, coke, and gas was proposed and kinetic parameters were estimated from the experimental data.

     "abstract": "Owning to amazing nature of ionic liquids (ILs), they can be applied in numerous chemical fields and industrial plants. ILs have great potential to capture greenhouse gases. On the other hands, experimental measurements are time-consuming and costly. Hence, looking for a precise model to estimate the solubility of CO2 as an important greenhouse gas in the presence or absence of impurities like H2S, SO2, CH4, H2, and N2O and different solvents like ILs and Amines is certainly crucial. To this end, Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) algorithm was developed as a reliable tool for estimating the solubility of CO2-rich gaseous mixtures containing H2S, SO2, CH4, and N2O and various ionic liquids like [C8mim][PF6], [C8mim][Tf2N], [bmim][MeSO4], [bmim][PF6], [bmim][Tf2N], [emim][dep], [thtdp][dca], [thtdp][phos], [hmim][Tf2N], [bmim][BF4], and [bmim][Ac] as function of temperature, pressure, mole fraction of ILs, mole ratio of CO2 to second gas in feed, and physical properties of ILs and second gas including molecular weight, critical pressure, and critical temperature. In addition, Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied to determine the hyperparameters of the LSSVM (\u03c32 and \u03b3). Results obtained from the statistical analyses confirm this fact that the approximations are in good agreement with the actual reported data points. A comparison was carried out between the obtained results from the LSSVM model and three different kinds of machine learning approaches such as the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN), radial basis function artificial neural network (RBF-ANN), and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The statistical analyses such as the Mean Relative Error (MRE%) and R-Square (R2) were obtained as 0.7545 and 1.0000, 18.06 and 0.9956, 7.016 and 0.9993, 50.63, 0.9628 for the LSSVM, RBF-ANN, MLP-ANN, and ANFIS, respectively.

The optimal degree of polymerization (DP) for CO2-philic groups in PVDBM-b-PDMAEMA was 8, because increasing the DP of PVDBM increased the CO2-philicity, whereas increased molecular weight limited the miscibility in water. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to determine the hydrophilic/CO2-philic balance (HCB). It was found that enhanced CO2-philic tails widened the HCB range, and the optimal range of the HCB was varied with CO2-philic tail types.

The influence of the average residence time on the extraction results was studied by varying the capillary length as well as the overall flow rate. Experimental results proved that thermodynamic equilibrium is reached in the micro-mixer and therefore the extraction cannot be enhanced by increasing the capillary length. On the other hand, in the experiments with different overall flow rate but same solvent-to-feed ratio (S/F), changes in the K-factor were observed when having a feed of 50\u00a0wt.% ethanol: the K-factor decreased as the total volumetric flow rate increased.

The suitability of carbon dioxide (CO2) as dispersion promoter in liquid\u2013liquid (water-in-oil) dispersions is explained as a result of its concentration in the mixture.

To realize cutting results comparable to water, liquid and coherent CO2-jets with high specific energy have to be formed. However, CO2 does not exist as a liquid in thermodynamic equilibrium at atmospheric pressure. During the expansion through a nozzle from a liquid state to atmospheric pressure the saturation curve is crossed and a spray consisting of a gaseous and solid phase is generated. We show that with sufficiently low injection temperatures the phase change is delayed and liquid jets emanate from the nozzle even at atmospheric pressure. These jets disintegrate closer to the nozzle than water jets at same pressure and nozzle conditions. The shorter jet length results in lower kerf depths.

The loading of vitamin E 0.49\u00a0g\u00a0g\u22121-hydrogel by the supercritical impregnation results in the significant reduction of the diffusivity of timolol maleate in the silicone hydrogel to 1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0mm2\u00a0min\u22121 much smaller than of that without vitamin E, 13\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0mm2\u00a0min\u22121. The release system of timolol maleate in silicone hydrogel with the low diffusivity is obtained from the effective loading of vitamin into the silicone hydrogel using the supercritical impregnation.",

The solubility differences between the components increase slightly with the temperature, however a sufficient pressure difference exists for 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene to be isolated at temperature higher than 343\u00a0K.

Results showed that the frictional pressure-drop increases significantly with increasing mass flux, particularly when the bulk enthalpy surpasses the pseudo-critical enthalpy. A local hump in the friction factor was observed corresponding to the pseudo-critical enthalpy, which becomes stronger with the decrease of mass flux or pressure. The assessment of correlations demonstrated that constant-property-based correlations fail to predict the friction factor of supercritical water. Hence, an improved correlation was proposed which captures 82.6% of the experimental data within \u00b125% error band.",

     "abstract": "Drug/lense combinations have proven significant in the field of ocular therapeutics. The development of innovative systems and elaboration processes is an upcoming issue for ocular drug delivery. One challenging issue is the elaboration of drug loaded intraocular lenses (IOLs) to combine cataract surgery and post-operative treatments in a single procedure. In this work, we are studying the elaboration of such systems while using a green process using supercritical fluids for impregnating ophthalmic drugs on commercial IOLs. More particularly, rigid commercial intraocular lenses made from Poly (Methyl MethAcrylate) (PMMA), used in cataract surgery, are loaded with dexamethasone 21- phosphate disodium salt (DXP, an anti-inflammatory drug) and ciprofloxacin (CIP, an antibiotic) in order to prevent short- and mid-term postoperative complications. Supercritical impregnations were carried out in a batch mode and impregnation yields were determined through drug release kinetic studies in a solution simulating the aqueous humor. Before performing an experimental design, preliminary impregnation assays were conducted in order to delimit the operating domain. Transparent IOLs presenting an effective impregnation were obtained. The highest impregnation yields for DXP and CIP in PMMA IOLs were 18.3 and 2.8\u00a0\u03bcgdrug/mgIOL respectively. Despite the low solubility of each drug in the fluid phase, homogeneous and in-depth impregnations were successfully obtained with a prolonged drug delivery (about 40\u00a0days) for most impregnation experiments.",

     "abstract": "Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi is a South American plant with medicinal properties. We report the extraction of compounds from S. terebinthifolius fruits using supercritical CO2 (scCO2), with emphasis on the effects of scCO2 pressure (100\u2013300\u00a0bar) and temperature (40\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C) on global yield, volatile compounds, and antiproliferative activity against nine human tumor cell lines. Supercritical extracts obtained at 50\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C, independently of pressure, showed potent activity against kidney cancer with total growth inhibition <3.9\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Furthermore, extracts obtained at 200\u00a0bar and 50\u00a0\u00b0C showed potent activity against multidrug-resistant ovarian, prostate, and ovarian tumor cell lines, and glioma. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the following volatile compounds: \u03b4-3-carene, \u03b1-phellandrene, limonene, germacrene D, and caryophyllene. The results suggest that sesquiterpenes may be the metabolites responsible for the antiproliferative activity. However, future work involving fractionation of the extracts might shed light on the chemical compounds responsible for each antiproliferative activity.",

The complex viscosity and storage modulus of pre-cured polyurethane saturated under supercritical CO2 increased with improving the crosslinking network induced by either pre-curing or nano-silica. Moreover, the raised crosslinking density could depress the CO2 diffusion and thus the reduction of the viscosity and modulus. It was shown that the matrix viscoelasticity impacted the cell morphology in different ways as the cell diameter was varied significantly. The compressive hysteresis results showed that the energy absorption of millable polyurethane elastomer was enhanced after the introduction of microcells. The tensile strength of millable polyurethane nanocomposite foam decreased with increasing the cell diameter, and displayed a linear relationship with cell diameter on a double logarithmic scale.",

A factorial experimental design was applied in order to evaluate the effect of five process variables at two levels (sepiolite content: 1\u201310% w/w; initial ketone mole fraction: 0.0017\u20130.0025; pressure: 9\u201313\u00a0MPa; depressurization rate: 0.5\u20132.0\u00a0MPa/min; time: 2\u20134\u00a0h) on impregnation yield, at 45\u00a0\u00b0C. ANOVA test of the results indicated that pressure, time and ketone mole fraction significantly affect impregnation yield (ranging between 2.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 and 8.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.66% w/w). Thermal analysis (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) allowed to investigate the nanocomposite morphology and the modifications induced by the impregnation. The mechanical properties of the films were assessed by stress-strain tests, showing that the impregnation process had a very low impact on the material ductility and strength.",

Particularly, the reduction of IFT with increasing pressure at isothermal conditions evidences adsorption of nitrogen at the n-alkane surface, a behavior that was clearly corroborated by analyzing the trend of concentration profiles and Gibbs adsorption isotherms. Results based on SGT and MD revel that as the molecular chain length increases (from n-pentane to n-octane), the surface activity increases and the interface width decreases, implying thus that the IFT of the mixture increases.",

Liquid-vapor, liquid-liquid and liquid-liquid-vapor phase transitions were observed. Based on phase behavior, the selected SAS encapsulation conditions were: 35 and 45\u00a0\u00b0C, CO2 mass fraction of 92.5 and 95.0%, and pressures of 90 and 110\u00a0bar. Microscopy images showed that pressure affected PLGA\u00a0+\u00a0passion fruit seed oil particles morphology and size, which varied from spherical shape at low pressure (90\u00a0bar) to irregular shape at high pressure (110\u00a0bar). The particle size ranged from 721 to 1498\u00a0nm and the oil encapsulation efficiency varied from 67.8 to 91%. According to differential scanning calorimetry results, all SAS conditions produced particles with encapsulated oil. The oil release consisted of an initial burst, raising gradually (until 24\u00a0h), followed by a uniform release up to 72\u00a0h. The amount of oil released reached 88% of total entrapped material. This study shows the potential of using green methods to aggregate value to agroindustrial waste materials.",

     "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a tropical disease which main treatment indicated by World Health Organization (WHO) is parenteral pentavalent antimony application; however the widespread usage of this drug is limited due to its toxicity, low efficiency and cost, and also requires medical assistance for application. Topical treatment is proposed using wound dressings with controlled drug delivery against cutaneous leishmaniasis, since dressings can control the water and oxygen permeability necessary for wound healing. This way, commercial wound dressings based on biopolymers (Spongostan\u00ae and Promogran\u00ae), were loaded with copaiba oil using supercritical solvent impregnation (SSI/SSD) as an alternative topical antileishmanial treatment. SSI/SSD experimental runs were carried out at 45\u00a0\u00b0C and for scCO2 densities of 701, 801 and 900\u00a0kg/m3. Results show that process conditions affect the oil impregnation with improvement of from 1.4 up to 3.8 times. The biopolymers affinities with copaiba oil, the sorption of scCO2 in the biopolymers and copaiba oil solubility in scCO2 shown to be important factors for the studied systems. Spongostan\u00ae had improved its thermal stability, probably promoted by the copaiba oil plasticizing effect during the process. The main compound found in copaiba oil, \u03b2-caryophyllene, which presents leishmanicidal and anti-inflammatory activities, was successfully loaded using scCO2 in both wound dressings, and showed to be promising to further analysis on leishmaniasis wound.",

The amount of carbohydrates recovered increased sharply in the initial stages of the process, due to the extraction of soluble carbohydrates, and then less pronouncedly, as hydrolysis of WWGP took place. The difference in the progress curves for the yields of carbohydrates and of phenolics allowed the separate recovery of carbohydrate-rich, and phenolics-enriched, GP extracts. The latter exhibited 10 times higher antioxidant activity (AA) than a GP extract obtained by hydro-alcoholic extraction, and 8 times lower AA than pure ascorbic acid.

At 200\u00a0bar pressure, the contents in the scCO2 extracts of aldehydes, furanones, coniferyl alcohol, coniferyl aldehyde, and vanillin increased with extraction time. Acids, ketones and most of the guaiacols decreased while phenols and pyrans remained the same. More acids, ketones, and furaldehydes could be obtained at a lower temperature and more aromatic compounds could be extracted when SiO2 as the carrier was employed.

However, when the mixture of ethylene glycol and water were used as co-solvent, short nanorods or even nanoparticles were found instead. It indicates that the role of the co-solvent may have many aspects, such as enhancement of the precursor dissolution, change of the interaction between the precursor and the substrates and so on. In addition, it was found that a larger amount of co-solvent had negative effect on the metal loading, mainly due to the phase separation of the ternary system of supercritical CO2, co-solvent and inorganic precursors.",

This behavior corroborates with the presence of hysteresis phenomenon in permeability curves and solubility results. Also, zeta potential showed a decrease in the membrane point of zero charge (PZC) after pressurization/depressurization cycle, suggesting possible CO2 sorption in the membrane polymer.

The simulations were performed by Aspen Plus considering a continuous multitubular reactor operating at 280\u00a0\u00b0C, 128\u00a0bar, methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 24, propane-to-methanol molar ratio of 0.05, and a residence time of 9.7\u00a0min. The use of flash separators instead of distillation columns for methanol and propane separation contribute significantly to reduce the energy requirement, with respect to other studies. Final products are high purity of methyl esters (99.8%) and glycerol (96.4%). The economic analysis of the biodiesel plant resulted in a break-even point for the biodiesel selling price of 0.479\u00a0\u20ac/kg (at 10% rate of return), so the process can compete with the existing alkali and acid catalyzed processes.",

In the lower pressure regime, the molar flux of the permeant linearly slows down with the pressure decrease. The high-pressure regime is characterized by a pressure independent molar flux of SC-CO2 through the elastomer.

The cracking experiments were carried out at 450\u00a0\u00b0C. Three species of cracking: maltene, asphaltene, and coke were then weighed and their corresponding speciation was defined. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and elemental analysis (CHNS) tests were utilized to prove the performance of upgrading reactions. It was revealed that NiO showed the best performance among other catalyst, in which its activity and stability in catalytic cracking changed slightly. According to the results obtained from GC\u2013MS, NMR, TGA, and CHNS anlyses, it was confirmed that the proportion of heavy hydrocarbons of products (i.e. non-catalytic and catalytic reactions) was lower than that of feedstock.",

The solvation features associated with the concentration of cosolvent in the fluid (0.03 and 0.06\u00a0mol fraction), and with the choice of the thermodynamic state: at a temperature range of 318\u2013348\u00a0K at densities corresponding to experimental isobar 30\u00a0MPa, and at change of density (0.507\u20130.851\u00a0g/cm3) at constant temperature 328\u00a0K have been researched. It is shown that the solvation of parabens in modified supercritical CO2 occurs due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with a cosolvent. Structural and dynamic parameters of these hydrogen bonds have been considered. Free energies of solvation of parabens in pure and modified supercritical CO2 at T\u00a0=\u00a0328\u00a0K, P\u00a0=\u00a021\u00a0MPa and 30\u00a0MPa, have been calculated. Evaluation of cosolvent induced solubility enhancement has been made on the basis of the free energy of solvation. It is found that the use of methanol as a cosolvent will result in many times greater increase in solubility of parabens in supercritical CO2, than the use of acetone. It is shown that the cosolvent induced solubility enhancement of parabens in acetone-modified supercritical CO2 is much less sensitive to such factors as change of fluid pressure and concentration of a cosolvent than that in methanol-modified supercritical CO2.",

The experiment was performed by supplying the oil (from the top) and SCW/O2 fluid (from the bottom) into a vertically located tubular reactor packed with AC. The obtained time dependences of the reactor wall temperature and the power of resistance heaters allowed revealing that due to heat generation during the combustion of AC and oil high-molecular components in SCW/O2 fluid the conversion process occurs in autothermal mode. The overall yield of volatile combustibles and liquid products of oil conversion amounted to 24.0 and 59.5\u00a0wt.%, respectively. It is shown that the involvement of water in redox reactions with AC and oil high-molecular components accumulated in the AC bed, contributes to the enrichment of conversion products with hydrogen (the portion of H2 and CH4 in the volatile combustible products is >60\u00a0mol.%). We detected a significant decline in the fractions of asphaltene and resin, as well as the content of vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) in the liquid products compared to crude oil due to their accumulation in the AC bed. It follows from the results of IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy that a significant increase in the content of aromatic compounds in the liquid products occurs only at the increase in oxygen flow rate up to 3.5\u00a0g/min.",

Pressure, temperature and sterilization time were studied for optimum sterilization conditions by measuring the reduction of microbes before and after treatment of OPF using SC-CO2 and autoclave. Sterilizing OPF with SC-CO2 resulted in major changes in the physical, fruit surface and texture when compared to autoclave.

They are highly bioactive compounds, potentially useful for therapeutic applications, as antiviral, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer agents. Extraction processes using pressurized hot water offer an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional extraction and purification methods applied to anthraquinone-containing plants. Knowledge on high-pressure phase equilibria of anthraquinone\u00a0+\u00a0solvent mixtures is required to evaluate the potentiality of these processes. The need is for both, experimental data and thermodynamic models that are able to predict phase boundaries at different process conditions. In this work, the solubility of 1,4-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone (quinizarin) in pressurized hot water has been measured, using a simple and reliable dynamic method. For the binary \u00a0quinizarin +\u00a0H2O, the measurements were performed at (333, 353, 373, 393, 413, 443, 463) K and pressures of (30, 60 and 90) bar. The group-contribution with association equation of state (GCA-EOS), with the definition of a cyclic ketone functional group (CyCO) was used to calculate solid-liquid equilibria of binary mixtures of anthraquinones with pressurized hot water. This model was able to give a good representation of the solubility behaviour of quinizarin in water.",

Furthermore, because of the importance of the pressure of solution inside the reaction medium on the H/D exchange process as well as the impurity production, which have not been studied thoroughly, estimation of density for the benzene-water mixture under these operational conditions was studied with Aspen software.

     "abstract": "Rare earth elements are a critical component in many clean energy technologies. Extraction of individual rare earth elements from natural ores or recycled material is challenging due to the very similar chemical properties across the lanthanide series. Supercritical carbon dioxide has emerged in recent years as a possible extraction medium for rare earth elements, due to its tunability and selectivity as a solvent. In this study, rare earth elements were recovered from bastn\u00e4site concentrate using supercritical carbon dioxide extraction with nitric acid/tributyl phosphate adducts. Two bastn\u00e4site pretreatment methods were used to render the rare earth elements amenable to recovery: 1) dry roasting of the source material at 730\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h, and 2) decomposition with 50% sodium hydroxide solution at 150\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. These pretreated powder samples were extracted in supercritical carbon dioxide at 34\u00a0MPa and 65\u00a0\u00b0C, with kinetic samples obtained at 15\u201330\u00a0min intervals. A range of tributyl phosphate/nitric acid adduct compositions (from 2\u00a0mol/L H+ to 6\u00a0mol/L H+) were used in order to determine the effect of adduct composition on recovery rate. The results showed the fastest extraction with an adduct containing approximately 4\u00a0mol/L H+. Adducts with higher acidity showed reduced extraction of cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium. This could be due to the formation of aqueous droplets which dissolve rare earth elements and create an equilibrium limitation, or due to competition between the rare earth nitrates and nitric acid for coordination with tributyl phosphate. Extraction with various adduct concentrations in supercritical CO2 showed the expected increase in reaction rate with increased adduct concentration. For the 4\u00a0mol/L H+ adduct at 5.0 mol% adduct concentration, roasted bastn\u00e4site recoveries were 72% for La, 96% for Ce, 88% for Pr, and 90% for Nd after 120\u00a0min. For 4\u00a0mol/L H+ adduct at 5.1 mol% adduct concentration, NaOH digested bastn\u00e4site recoveries were 93% for La, 100% for Ce, 99% for Pr, and 101% for Nd after 90\u00a0min. Though further research is needed, these results are a key step in demonstrating applicability of supercritical extraction to rare earth element ores.",

The results obtained have revealed that an increase of fluid density and cosolvent concentration provide increasing the average number of hydrogen bonds formed by the solute with cosolvent. Ab initio calculations of formation energy of hydrogen-bonded complexes solute \u2013 cosolvent have been performed. Solvation free energy of the phenolic acids in SC CO2 with and without cosolvents was evaluated by means of the Bennett\u2019s acceptance ratio method. The solvation free energy has been found to be strongly dependent on the number of hydrogen bonds solute \u2013 cosolvent. Cosolvent-induced solubility enhancement values were also calculated. The results indicate that the increase in solubility of the phenolic acids is observed by passing from the pure SC CO2 through acetone-modified to methanol-modified solvent.

Under supercritical conditions, the presence of a single phase increases the reaction kinetics, avoiding the limitation by interphase mass transfer, and enabling to carry out the process with low residence time. The proposed process is based on two fixed-bed catalytic reactors in series, with intermediate glycerol separation. CO2 used as co-solvent decreases the critical temperature, enabling to carry out the process in milder conditions. The intermediate glycerol separation displaces the chemical equilibrium towards higher conversion of triglyceride, increasing biodiesel yield.

The hydration selectivity of 1-octene conversion had a local maximum at around 330\u00a0\u00b0C, which was explained by considering the change in reactivity of water as a reactant caused by changes in both water density and the degree of hydrogen bonding.",

The kinetics of the decomposition at 423\u2013453\u00a0K and 15\u201325\u00a0MPa in scCO2 were studied. The decomposition reaction generally followed the first-order kinetics. The reaction rate was slightly increased with an increase in the pressure, due to changes in the scCO2 density. The activation energy of the decomposition was calculated as 60.3\u00a0kJmol\u22121 at 15\u00a0MPa, 56.3\u00a0kJmol\u22121 at 20\u00a0MPa and 52.4\u00a0kJmol\u22121 at 25\u00a0MPa, which are lower values than those observed in air and in vacuum. The pressure dependence of the activation energy of the decomposition reaction was clarified quantitatively for the first time, and revealed the energy conservation benefit of using scCO2 as a process solvent for a variety of metal/metal oxide deposition process of nanomaterials.",

     "abstract": "Even after almost forty years of industrial application, companies are still reluctant to use supercritical (sc) CO2 as a solvent for extractions due to the perceived high production costs. Literature on the matter suggests that, because extraction at high pressure needs to be done in batches, using multiple extraction vessels with simulated-countercurrent flow could reduce operational costs. However, the more extraction vessels used, the less time there is to recondition them in order to have a semi-continuous operation; and if the reconditioning, and particularly the depressurization, is done too fast, the vessel could become brittle and permanently damaged. With the goal of optimizing the depressurization process in mind, numerical simulation of temperature and mass was carried considering a 1-dm3 vessel filled with a packed bed made with model materials using a mass flow function that depends on the chocked mass flux and a valve opening area. The correlation N u = 0.0777 D a \u2212 0.0373 R a 0.397 was obtained for convective heat transfer at the vessel wall, and temperature, pressure, and vented mass flow were simulated with about 20% improvement in predictions in comparison to our previous correlation. To explore the use of the model for practical purposes, it was used to simulate depressurization processes with volumes up to 1\u00a0m3 and with different initial conditions and vessel geometries so as to have a first approach on the effect of these parameters on the depressurization time. Simulated depressurization times reached a maximum value of 54.5\u00a0min for depressurizations of a 1-m3 extraction vessel starting at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 70\u00a0MPa, which are very plausible extraction conditions. This model can be used to determine optimal reconditioning time in industrial plants for cost minimization.",

For 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0m3 extraction plants, increasing extraction pressure from 30 to 50\u00a0MPa decreased production cost 30.9%, but when extraction pressure further increased from 50 to 70\u00a0MPa production cost only decreased 9.9%. Results suggest that the recommended extraction pressure for oilseed extraction is 50\u00a0MPa. Also, this work compared plants operating at the three extraction pressures when annual productivity was kept constant (231, 456, or 596 ton of oil per year).

Optimum production cost in these cases was quite similar for plants operating at 30, 50, and 70\u00a0MPa, but the total volume of the plant decreased 63.6% when increasing extraction pressure from 30 to 50\u00a0MPa for the plant producing 456 ton of oil per year, and an additional 31% when increasing it from 50 to 70\u00a0MPa. The lowest production cost estimated was 5.52 USD per kg of oil (optimum extraction time of 2.75\u00a0h) in a 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0m3 plant processing 2-mm prepressed oilseeds, and operating at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u00a0MPa. The manuscript includes a sensitivity analysis on production cost as a function of a variation of \u00b150% of uncertain variables cost (respect to nominal values), which were considered as constant in our previous contributions. That cost items were unitary cost of annual labor, CO2, and substrate, being the variation of the last one the more significant effect on production cost.",

The extraction yields obtained through the application of these two extraction techniques were comparable, but higher a concentration of polyphenolic compounds (total phenols (TP) from 7.3088 to 10.6441\u00a0g GAE/100\u00a0g, and total flavonoids (TF) from 1.0344 to 1.8638\u00a0g CE/100\u00a0g) were recovered using SWE during a significantly shorter extraction time. SWE, as the more appropriate extraction technique, was further optimized by simultaneous maximization of total phenols (TP), total flavonoids (TF) yields and antioxidant activity. In order to optimize the SWE process, a Box-Behnken three level three variables experimental design was used. Temperature (T, 120\u2013220\u00a0\u00b0C), extraction time (t, 10\u201330\u00a0min) and hydrochloride concentration (c, 0\u20131.5%) were independent variables. The experimentally obtained values were fitted to a second-order polynomial model. Multiple regression analysis and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to determine model fitness and optimal conditions. The optimal SWE conditions were determined to be a temperature of 151.2\u00a0\u00b0C, an extraction time of 10\u00a0min and an addition of 1.5% HCl. The predicted values of targeted responses under these conditions were: 9.8431\u00a0g GAE/100\u00a0g, 1.7558\u00a0g CE/100\u00a0g, 5.02\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 27.60\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for TP, TF, IC50 and EC50, respectively.

     "abstract": "Turbulent combustion modelling under high-pressure conditions is a key issue for the design of future aero or rocket engines. In the context of large-eddy simulations, the exact filtered equation of state (EoS) is generally approximated by an EoS directly computed from the Favre filtered quantities for species mass fractions and temperature. The soundness of this approximation is presently addressed through the analysis of laminar CH4-air and CH4-O2 high-pressure premixed and non-premixed flames. Their computations were performed either with the ideal gas equation of state (EoS) or with a high-pressure package that gather a cubic EoS along with additional pressure-dependent transport parameters and thermodynamic relations. Various kinetic schemes are used for the computation of laminar premixed flames and a comparison with available experimental data is provided for flame speed (SL). Laminar premixed CH4-O2 flames exhibit micro metric flame thickness for pressures above 2.0\u00a0MPa as well as a high flame temperature (>3000\u00a0K). These flamelets were then filtered either with a Gaussian filter or through a \u03b2-pdf technique. The resulting filtered profiles were used to approximate the filtered pressure, p \u00af . A negligible error is observed for CH4-air flames when comparing p \u00af with the exact filtered pressure. However, significant errors were found for high-pressure CH4-O2 flames, that increase with the filter size. This behaviour is exacerbated for transcritical injections meaning that classical techniques that use tabulated thermochemistry methods in compressible codes must be revisited in that context. A correction to the tabulated chemistry approach coupled to a presumed subgrid pdf is finally proposed to comply with high-pressure considerations.",

Thus, an acceptable conversion rate and good enantioselectivity could be obtained but kinetics were shown to remain slower compared to an aqueous phase/decane two-phase system. Moreover, increasing pressure was shown to further slowdown the kinetics. This was hypothesized to be related to the mechanism of opening of the active site of the lipase which requires interfacial contact with a hydrophobic solvent phase.

The technique used supercritical fluid deposition (SCFD) to deposit films on planar and high-aspect-ratio (high-AR) trench substrates. SCFD consists of carrying out chemical reactions in scCO2 and is a commonly used method to form inorganic films. Diffusivity can be estimated by fitting the profile using surface reaction kinetics measured on a planar substrate, as the film thickness profile within a trench is a consequence of the diffusion and surface reactions of the source precursor. The method was demonstrated for titanium-di(isopropoxide)bis(tetramethylhexanedionate) at 250\u2013325\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u201320\u00a0MPa. The obtained diffusivities were correlated by the Stokes\u2013Einstein and Chapman\u2013Enskog equations, derived for liquids and gases, respectively.

The adsorption abilities of prepared MIPs was evaluated by binding kinetics, the binding isotherms, Scatchard analysis, the adsorption of materials with structures similar to templates, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, and the selectivity factor (a), The results of the evaluation indicate that the prepared MIPs have high separation abilities and selectivity. In addition, we identified that although there was a difference of adsorption quantities with the crosslinking agent contents (EGDMA contents), MIPs synthesized in this study had good adsorption selectivity in the presence of GA and its structure analogue materials. From this result, it could be found that the selectivity of MIPs was improved significantly by controlling the crosslinking agent.",

The feed mixture is very complex, with over 80 different compounds detected by GC. Among them, the EicosaPentaenoic Acid (EPA) and DodecaHexaenoic Acid (DHA) ethyl esters are of major industrial interest since the consumption of these \u03c9-3 acids has been linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. The influence of the process parameters on the separation efficiency is an important point for an economic analysis of the overall purification process. First, the partition of the feed mixture was determined for different solvent-to-feed ratios varying between 21.8 and 143; the extract yield (i.e. the mass fraction of feed recovered as extract) has been calculated for each condition. Then, a new simplified equilibrium-stage model was developed and applied to the mixture. Supposing a constant distribution ratio, this model is able to correlate the influence of the solvent-to-feed ratio (through a calculated extract yield) on the concentration of the major 24 compounds present either in the feed or in the extract and raffinate, including components with low, medium and high distribution ratios.",

Two separate phases were obtained in the extract, demonstrating that CC-SFF of aqueous apple aromas is highly capable of producing a water-free super-concentrated product. However, little fractionation of aromas from less important compounds such 1-hexanol was achieved. The highest concentration of C-6 apple aromas in the total extract was approx. 20% w/w, and the extraction yield of aromas was >86%.

     "abstract": "The mechanisms of heat transfer for the controlled decompression of supercritical (SC) carbon dioxide (CO2) from an extraction vessel have been rarely studied. Previous work on heat and mass transfer during controlled decompression of extraction vessels observed that suggested correlations could be improved if studies were carried out on vessels with better-defined heat transfer areas and using materials with well-defined physical properties. This work studies heat and mass transfer during decompression of a 1-L extraction vessel vented through a partially opened needle valve using a newly adapted system, different flow coefficients, and model materials, including cylinders of sintered stainless steel. Results showed that, opposite to previous experiments, there is a difference between wall and bulk temperatures of the fluid, and data suggested that there might be clamping occurring on the valve when the flow coefficient is low. Correlations were proposed for both vented mass flow, for which adjustment improved as the flow coefficient decreased; and heat transfer through the steel wall. The correlation Nu\u00a0=\u00a00.086\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Da\u22120.037Ra0.357 is proposed for the heat transfer through the steel wall for all material studied, which included the dimensionless Darcy number to take into account the properties and geometry of the packed bed, making it suitable for multiple systems. Mathematical simulation was used to verify calculations for the mean temperature of the steel wall of the vessel and results showed differences not higher than 1\u00a0\u00b0C between simulated and calculated data in almost all cases. These results can be used to validate those generated by mathematical simulation, which was shown in this work to be able to reproduce experimental results satisfactorily. A mathematical model can be later used to simulate decompressions of industrial vessels in order to determine the setup times required to replace exhausted by fresh substrate in industrial vessels in studies of minimization of production cost.",

     "abstract": "Over the past few years, both organic and inorganic nanoporous aerogels have shown a great promise as drug delivery vehicles. Different methods are utilized to load drugs into aerogels such as the addition of the drug to the reaction mixture in one of the steps before the gel formation or by supercritical deposition to the aerogels. These techniques have disadvantages such as possible reactions of pharmaceutical compounds with reactants used to form gels and low solubility of pharmaceutical compounds in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2). An alternative technique is to load the drug after gel formation by contacting the gel with a solution of the drug. The drug diffuses into the liquid inside the pores. When this drug-loaded gel is subjected to supercritical drying, scCO2 not only removes the solvent from the pores but also acts as an antisolvent, which causes the precipitation of the drug in the pores of the aerogel. This is similar to the gas antisolvent crystallization (GAS) process but in this case the process takes place inside the pores. In this study, this technique was used to load paracetamol into silica aerogels. The factors affecting the amount and distribution of the drug inside the aerogel matrix were investigated and a mathematical model to account for the movement of paracetamol inside the pores during supercritical drying leading to a varying drug concentration in the matrix with position was developed. It was concluded that high initial concentrations resulted in more homogeneous drug distributions. Moreover, XRD analysis demonstrated that paracetamol was in crystalline form. The process enables higher amount of loadings than conventional systems and also offers an advantage as it combines two processes such as drying and loading in a single one reducing the time and the operating expenses.",

For ethane, the magnitude of the attractive energy was almost equal to that of the repulsive energy. In contrast, the magnitude of the attractive energy for ethanol was four times greater than that of the repulsive energy. The significant difference in the attractive energies of ethane and ethanol is attributed to the solvation of the CO2 molecules at the oxygen atom of ethanol, according to analyses of local density and quantum chemical calculations.

The CNPs produced using this method were highly dispersible in water because their surfaces were modified by hydrophilic groups derived from the amino acids. The number of carbons in the straight chain of the source amino acids affected the generation of the CNPs, leading to different particle sizes, crystallinities, and nitrogen compositions. The oxygen content in the CNPs was independent of the source amino acid, but the nitrogen content was affected by the atomic ratio of nitrogen in the source amino acid.",

     "abstract": "Extrusion assisted by supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) is an emerging method for the microcellular foaming of polymer. Instead of batch foaming, which requires formation of single-phase polymer/CO2 solution in long cycle times, the extrusion assisted by supercritical fluids overcomes this issue by providing rapid mixing and dissolution of CO2 in the polymer melt. Because the sc-CO2 is soluble in many molten polymers and acts as a removable plasticizer, its introduction in an extruder will permit a decrease of the processing temperature. This technic allows the use of fragile component like active molecule or starchy and proteinaceous materials. At the end of the extruder, the pressure drop will create instability and phase separation with the creation of porosity. This review is dedicated to the extrusion assisted by sc-CO2 with different types of biopolymer. Industrial application domains include agro-food, biomedical, pharmaceutical, packaging and many others.",

The compatibility of LDPE/HDPE blends is characterized by using thermal analysis and rheology methods. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) traces and rheology methods confirmed their good compatibility. For LDPE/PP blends, the incompatibility has been widely acknowledged in the literature. The distribution of the PP phase in the blend is investigated using polarized optical microscopy (POM). It is found that the phase structure is closely related to the blend composition and the viscosity ratio of the blend components. Extrusion foaming of the blends is conducted using a single extruder fitted with a CO2 gas injection system. Under similar foaming conditions, the compatible LDPE/HDPE blends all generated a uniform cell morphology and achieved roughly the same expansion ratio. Although the incompatible interface is beneficial to cell nucleation, the LDPE/PP blends did not achieve satisfactory foaming performance. To determine the differences in the foaming behavior of the two blends, the viscoelastic properties and diffusion coefficients of supercritical CO2 in the blends, were accurately measured via rheology and magnetic suspension balance (MSB) methods. The results indicate that the viscoelastic properties did not show a dominant role in determining the foaming behavior, by contrast, CO2 diffusion is found to be the key factor affecting foaming performance especially in the case of a co-continuous phase structure.",

The BS ratio was varied by changing the amount of either the biomass or the solvent, and the yields of the liquefaction products (i.e., bio-oil, gas, and solid residue) and the bio-oil quality were compared. When the BS ratio was increased from 0.10 to 0.17 by changing the amount of ethanol, the bio-oil yield decreased significantly from 79.5 to 37.8\u00a0wt%, whereas for the same increase in BS ratio effected by changing the amount of biomass, the bio-oil yield decreased less significantly from 79.5 to 60.0\u00a0wt%.

Raw avocado oil is a special oil similar to olive oil. In order to combine the advantage of using a clean technology with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) to extract avocado oil and use it as a co-solvent with scCO2 in carotenoid extraction from tomato pomace, simultaneous extractions of oil and lycopene were carried out to produce an avocado oil enriched with lycopene and a semi defatted avocado cake of potential commercial value. Therefore, freeze-dried avocado and tomato pomace were placed separately in the same fixed bed extractor, where lipids and lycopene were simultaneously extracted with scCO2, first passing through the avocado bed and then both scCO2 and the oil extracted from avocado passed through the second bed of tomato pomace. Lipids extracted in the first bed served as a co-solvent with scCO2 for lycopene extraction in the second bed. The experiments were performed using different proportions of the raw materials at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 400\u00a0bar and in equal parts of avocado pulp and tomato pomace while varying the temperature and pressure conditions (40, 50 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C; 200, 300 and 400\u00a0bar). The results showed that the lycopene extraction yields (lycopene recovery) increased as the proportion of avocado increased and the best condition for extraction of lycopene present in tomato pomace was at 400\u00a0bar and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. The extracts are raw avocado oils enriched with about 110\u2013170\u00a0\u03bcg of lycopene per gram of oil, resulting from up to 80% recovery of oil and lycopene.

All the metal/rGO catalysts showed high activities and selectivities of ca. 90% to the partially hydrogenated form, p-menthene, that kept constant with reaction time. The Ru/rGO catalyst was reused up to 4 times with minor loss of activity and constant selectivity.

Its robustness and efficiency were validated on the example of furanocoumarins and waxes extracted from aerial parts of common rue with supercritical CO2 at pressures and temperatures (12\u201330)\u00a0MPa and (313\u2013333)\u00a0K. For the purpose of modeling, the waxes are represented by n-tritriacontane and furanocoumarins \u2013 by xanthotoxin, the solubility of which in CO2 was measured using the dynamic method. A rigorous thermodynamic modeling framework was applied to calculate the composition-dependent solubilities of extracted compounds, which were incorporated in the kinetics model in order to calculate the extraction curves. For individual extraction curves, the average absolute deviation between the calculated and experimental extraction yields, expressed as percentage of the asymptotic extraction yield, was in the range (0.2\u20135.8) %.",

     "abstract": "Electrical power generation by closed loop Brayton cycle using supercritical CO2 (sCO2) as a working fluid has gained significant interest in recent years. Integrating sCO2 cycle with renewable energy technology (i.e. solar heliostat field) at high temperature ranges has shown promising results. This study highlights the thermodynamic benefits of recompression sCO2 Brayton cycle and presents a modelling and control strategy to optimize operating conditions for a constant power output utilising solar- and fossil-based heat sources. This optimization maximizes solar field contribution and minimizes the role of auxiliary fossil-fuelled back-up (AFB) heating system. The performances of two common solar heat input (direct and indirect) configurations are compared. It is found that for a specific day, an indirect cycle consumes 19.5% less fossil fuel compared to an equivalent direct cycle. This is mainly attributed to the usage of thermal energy storage (TES) in the indirect cycle. However, the high capital cost of TES and operability/controllability issues may decrease the merits of the indirect cycle. Although the reliance on fossil fuel contribution in direct cycle is higher by a magnitude of 4.2% or less, this may be economically admissible compared to the substantial reduction in capital cost as in the case of indirect cycle.",

     "abstract": "Upgrading of de-oiled asphaltenes (DOAs), i.e., the heavy fraction obtained after solvent deasphalting of vacuum residue, was investigated in supercritical methanol (scMeOH) without using external catalysts and molecular hydrogen. Process parameters, including temperature (350\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C), reaction time (30\u2013120\u00a0min), and additive (formic acid), were explored to optimize the yield of light oil with few impurities. As a result of the beneficial in-situ hydrogen-donation ability and reactivity of scMeOH, its use resulted in higher DOA conversion, increased light-fraction yield, and fewer impurities as compared to those obtained in supercritical water (scH2O). Higher reaction temperatures and residence times increased the DOA conversion to low-molecular-weight saturates and aromatics. With the addition of formic acid as a secondary source of H2 in scMeOH at 400\u00a0\u00b0C, a 16.7\u00a0wt% DOA concentration, and a 90\u00a0min residence time, a remarkably high liquid oil yield of 83.9\u00a0wt% was obtained. The produced light fraction oil contains a low asphaltene content (0.53\u00a0wt%) and few impurities (S, 2.74\u00a0wt%; Fe, 19.6\u00a0ppm; Ni, non-detectable; V, 18\u00a0ppm). In addition, the maltenes content (i.e., saturates\u00a0+\u00a0aromatics) was 78.3% and the naphtha-to-diesel fraction was 18\u00a0wt% in the light-fraction oil; these results indicate effective cracking, desulfurization, and demetallization in the scMeOH medium with formic acid.

Electron microscopy observations and elemental analyses are conducted on the static capsule sample to investigate morphological features of the oxidation, micro-crack initiation as well as chemical composition along the micro-crack surface oxides and corrosion products around the micro-crack tip area. The elemental and phase analyses indicate that long term exposure to the SCW resulted in the formation of scales identified as Fe3O4 (magnetite, outer layer), Fe-Cr spinel (FeCr2O4, inner layer), [Mn,Cr]2O3\u00a0+\u00a0SiO2 (Cr-rich spinel and silicon dioxide, transition layer) on the substrate, and Ni-enrichment (chrome depleted region) in the alloy 310S. The presence of carbides along with chromium depletion region most probably result in grain boundary embrittlement around the micro-crack tip. Additionally, crack region is filled Cr-rich oxide, SiO2 and lower amount of carbides. We believe that the intergranular crack initiation occurred through grain boundary oxidation, leading to stress concentration.

The measured particle slippage velocities in the flowing direction were approximately 10.3% of the SC-CO2 flow rate. The measured particle slippage displacements were all at the centimeter level, which indicated that SC-CO2 had a superior particle transporting capability that was similar to those of liquids even if it had a low viscosity that was similar to those of gases. A numerical model was built, and analytic slippage calculations were performed for SC-CO2 for additional analyses. The density of SC-CO2 was found to have a greater influence on the slippage than the viscosity. Moreover, a comparison of the slippage between SC-CO2 and water showed that the particle slippage in water was constant, while the particle slippage in SC-CO2 continually accumulated at an extremely slow rate.",

The two-phase pressure loci at 23\u00a0\u00b0C and 40\u00a0\u00b0C are relatively flat and the cloud point pressures increase with PDMS molecular weight to a value of approximately 23\u00a0MPa for PDMS 9430. If PDMS is end-functionalized with CO2-phobic groups, however, the resultant molecules will exhibit higher cloud point pressures. Further, there is an optimal PDMS molecular weight for enhancing CO2 solubility of the end-functionalized compound. For example, when PDMS is terminated at each end with ethyl-naphthalene, the lowest cloud point pressures at 40\u00a0\u00b0C for mixtures of 1\u20134\u00a0wt% of the compound in CO2 are attained for a PDMS molecular weight of 2357. If the PDMS has a molecular weight of 1207 or less, the compound becomes less CO2-soluble because the unfavorable enthalpic interactions of CO2 and the ethyl-naphthalene groups become dominant. For PDMS of molecular weight 5664 or more, the entropic effects associated with higher molecular weight PDMS mixing with CO2, coupled with the unfavorable enthalpic effects between the end groups and CO2, result in the compound being CO2-insoluble. Finally, these design principles were used to generate 10 other end-functionalized PDMS-based compounds capable of dissolving at 1\u00a0wt% in CO2 at 23\u00a0\u00b0C and a pressure below 5000\u00a0psi based on PDMS segments containing 10\u201340 repeat units.",

To investigate the modification under basic condition, sodium octanoate was used as the additive instead of octanoic acid. The increase in concentration of octanoic acid brought about high aspect ratio boehmite particles, while adding sodium octanoate resulted in low aspect ratio boehmite. Since the particles synthesized at more acidic condition were densely covered by octanoic acid, it is considered that the surface modification by octanoic acid was facilitated at such acidic condition.

Subcritical water extractions were carried out at several temperatures ranging from 25 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C and two different extraction procedures have been used: individual and sequential extractions. For comparison purposes, microwave-assisted water extraction was carried out at the same extraction temperatures. The Plantago species\u2019 extracts were characterized in terms of total phenol content by using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Antioxidant activity was measured using two different in vitro assays, namely DPPH radical scavenging and TEAC (trolox equivalents antioxidant capacity). The identification of bioactive components was carried out using liquid chromatography coupled to diode array and mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). Results indicate the presence of various polyphenolic compounds such as plantamajoside, verbascoside and isoverbascoside and demonstrate that the extraction temperature had a positive influence on both extraction yield and antioxidant activity of the attained extracts. SWE and MAE demonstrated its usefulness as green extraction methods compared to traditional protocols and thus can be successfully employed to obtain bioactive extracts from Plantago species for their use in cosmetic and food industries.",

     "abstract": "Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO) is a high temperature and pressure process whose operating conditions are beyond the critical point of pure water (Tc\u00a0=\u00a0374\u00a0\u00b0C and Pc\u00a0=\u00a0221\u00a0bar), and is a powerful technology to treat wastewaters in a clean and effective manner. Moreover, the heat released during the oxidation reaction allows the recovery of energy and improves the efficiency of the process. In those cases where the reaction of high concentrated wastewaters generates a high temperature profile in a thermally insulating tubular reactor, a temperature control system is necessary to keep the operation within safety limits. With the aim of controlling the temperature along the reactor, both cooling water and oxidant split injectors have been installed in a 25\u00a0kg/h pilot plant. Experimental tests have been carried out to compare the operation of the pilot plant before and after those two improvements. Intermittent water injections provide a quick and located cooling. Each injection reduces the temperature inside the reactor by around 20\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C, and the frequency between injections depends on the exothermicity of reactions. When oxidant split is added in two injections, air in defect for the first injection (n \u22480.5) and in excess for the second one (n \u22481.2), the peak of temperature can also be smoothened and the development of the reaction can be controlled. In both cases, the temperature profile along the reactor is effectively controlled and the reaction remains within safe limits that allow a stable and reliable treatment of highly concentrated wastewaters.",

     "abstract": "In this work, a comparison between three extraction processes, including traditional maceration in n-hexane and ethyl alcohol, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and cyclically pressurized extraction known as rapid solid-liquid dynamic extraction (RSLDE), has been carried out for the extraction of pyrethrins, predominantly nonpolar natural compounds with insecticidal properties found in pyrethrum, an extract of certain species of chrysanthemums. Pyrethrins are often used in household insecticides and for the control of parasites on pets or livestock. Maceration is the cheapest method, but the values of the percent of extracted material compared to the weight of the dried flowers are lower. The extraction with supercritical CO2 is less efficient than the Naviglio extractor, but it has the advantage of not requiring the use of solvents. Consequently, all three techniques are valid for the extraction of compounds from pyrethrum flowers. The results obtained show that by suitably varying the parameters of the three extraction procedures, it is possible to obtain pyrethrin extracts for use in the production of low toxicity insecticides for warm-blooded animals and low pollution. In particular, extraction with supercritical CO2 presents an additional advantage; although oleoresin is a natural product, its extraction involves the use of solvents, while SFE is a highly efficient extraction process due to the use of CO2 in the supercritical phase without the use of solvents. On the other hand, the Naviglio extractor is an inexpensive technique and requires a minimum energy loss when compared to the extraction with supercritical fluids. Thus, the latter is more convenient on an industrial level but is not universally applicable. Nevertheless, the supercritical extraction can be used as a medium detergent of the oleoresin produced to avoid residues of the solvents left during the extraction process. Therefore, for demonstration purposes, for the SFE CO2 extraction process, numerical simulations have been performed, allowing for helpful results to optimize the process for further tests.",

The organometallic precursor, platinum(II) acetylacetonate, was deposited from solution in supercritical carbon dioxide. Analysis of the catalysts by high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy indicated that platinum was present in the form of highly dispersed metal nanoparticles. Pretreatment of the alumina-supported ceria in hydrogen prior to the deposition of the platinum precursor resulted in more platinum nucleated on ceria than non-pretreated alumina-supported ceria but varied in both particle size and structure. The ceria-containing catalyst that was not pretreated exhibited a more uniform particle size, and the Pt particles were encapsulated in crystalline ceria. Reaction rate measurements showed that the catalyst was more active for water-gas shift, with reaction rates per mass of platinum that exceeded most literature values for water-gas shift reaction on Pt-CeOx catalysts. The high activity was attributed to the significant fraction of platinum/ceria interfacial contact. These results show the promise of supercritical fluid deposition as a scalable means of synthesizing highly active supported metal catalysts that offer efficient utilization of precious metals.",

Vacuum residue was used as the feedstock and supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) was used as the primary solvent for extraction.

     "abstract": "To understand the role played by the impurities (such as N2, Ar, H2, CO, SO2, O2 and NO) during the processes of Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS), it is essential to know the thermodynamic properties of the CO2-impurities mixtures under the conditions of CO2 capture, transport and storage. Considering the variety of composition of these gas mixtures, it is necessary to have at one\u2019s disposal suitable models to predict their thermodynamic properties. In this work, two thermodynamic models: the E-PPR78 (Enhanced Predictive Peng-Robinson, 1978) and the PC-SAFT (Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory) models, are applied for describing the phase equilibria properties of 77 binary CCS mixtures containing CO2, gas impurities (SO2, O2 and NO), water and hydrocarbons. Our research results indicate that both models are able to accurately predict the phase behavior of binary CCS mixtures. It was however necessary to adjust the binary interaction parameters (kij,PC-SAFT) within the PC-SAFT model to improve the prediction accuracy. Compared to the PC-SAFT model with one temperature-independent binary interaction parameter, the E-PPR78 model normally shows better prediction accuracy for the investigated systems. In addition, to extend the experimental database which was built for the evaluations of Equation-of-State (EoS) modeling, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method is employed in this work to generate phase-equilibrium data of a few CCS mixtures deemed as insufficiently described by experimental measurements reported in the open literature.",

Results showed that weight gains vs. supercritical exposure time follows a parabolic law for alloy 304-ODS contrary to alloy 304 which possibly follows a cubic rate law. The general weight gain after 550\u00a0h exposure to the SCW was 131.8 and 621.6\u00a0mg/dm2 for alloys 304-ODS and 304, respectively. Electron microscopy observations and elemental analyses as well as X-ray diffraction and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry results revealed that the oxide scales formed on 304-ODS alloy composed of three distinct layers including Fe3O4 (outer layer), FeCr2O4/(Fe,Cr)2O3 spinel structures (inner layer) and Cr2O3 (transition layer). However, alloy 304 had two layers including Fe3O4 (outer layer) and Fe-Cr spinel structures (inner layer). It is believed that the formation of Cr2O3 layer at the diffusion layer/metal interface becomes the rate-limiting step for oxide advancement, since this change in oxide structure also corresponds to a decrease in corrosion rate in the alloy 304-ODS compared to alloy 304.

The proposed process was then evaluated in the economic aspect with the objective to show its feasibility in different scenarios. Among the 40 scenarios assessed, the more promising one in the techno-economic viewpoint is indicated in the larger plant capacity, with vessels of 500\u00a0L. For a productivity of 17.7 ton/year, the cost of manufacturing (COM) the microparticles was only US$ 63.98/kg. In such scenario, the return on investment, the payback time, and the gross margin were 120.8%, 0.8 years and 82.2%, respectively. The COM of powdered extracts is low because the acquisition cost of onion peels (food waste) is null. The main components that influence the COM are the fixed capital of investment (53\u201359%) and the cost of utilities (10\u201322%). The economic findings demonstrate that the process intensification (PLE\u00a0+\u00a0SAS) is a profitable alternative because the pressure energy applied in the extraction vessel can be used as useful energy for spraying and producing microparticles in the precipitation vessel.",

During the separation, the toluene recovery rate during is below 65%. In order to determine the reasons behind this malfunction, a thermodynamic study and a hydrodynamic study (Computational Fluid Dynamics, CFD) of the mixture separation in the cyclones were carried out. According to CFD, cyclones allow an efficient mechanical separation of the liquid solvent and the gaseous CO2. On the other hand, the thermodynamic model revealed that under the actual operating conditions, a large fraction of the solvent remains in gaseous state and is carried away through the cyclone gas outlet, hence the poor overall separation performance.",

This work aims at investigating the effect of molecular weight (Mn) of PVAc with different molecular chain structure on the CO2-philicity through dissolution behavior measurement and molecular modeling. Well-defined 3-armed and 4-armed R-core PVAc was synthesized by RAFT polymerization, and then the corresponding xanthate groups were removed. The CO2-philicity of multi-armed PVAc was found to be inferior to that of linear one at low Mn. With increasing the Mn from 1000 to 7000\u00a0g/mol, the cloud point pressures (Pc) of multi-armed PVAc first decreased, reached a minimum at a given Mn, and then increased, which was different from the variation trend of the Pc of linear PVAc versus Mn. In addition, removal of the xanthate groups could effectively enhance the CO2-philicity of PVAc, especially at low Mn. Moreover, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the interactions in polymer/CO2 systems indicated that the multi-armed structure had different effects on the compatibility with CO2 at different Mn. At low Mn, the polymer\u2fffpolymer interaction was the main driving force deciding the CO2-philicity due to the significant difference in different molecular chain structures. At high Mn, multi-armed structure enhanced the CO2-philicity due to the synergistic effect of moderate polymer\u2fffpolymer interaction and large polymer\u2fffCO2 interaction. The appropriate molecular chain structure could be selected to enhance the CO2-philicity of PVAc at a certain Mn.",

     "abstract": "The knowledge about crude oil phase behavior at high-pressures is a challenge for scientists due to inherent complexity to this systems. Some works employ model systems attempting to predict crude oil behavior, but the results are normally poor. In this sense, the use of real crude oil fractions can be an alternative to improve the accuracy of the models used in these simulations. In this work, a light oil sample has been fractionated to generate four representative fractions. An approach to estimate the critical properties of these distilled fractions using only density and vapor pressure experimental data is presented. In sequence, phase behavior of the pseudo binary (carbon dioxide (CO2)\u00a0+\u00a0real crude oil fractions), multicomponent (mixture of fractions\u00a0+\u00a0CO2) and original crude oil\u00a0+\u00a0CO2 systems were determined using static synthetic method and static synthetic\u00a0+\u00a0NIR, with CO2 molar fraction range of 0.367-0.986, temperature range of 20\u2fff80\u00a0\u00b0C and pressure up to 300\u00a0bar.

Selection of the appropriate solvent determined the success of the precipitation process. A mixture of acetone and DMSO in a 9:1 ratio was selected in order to study the main parameters that influence the SAS process in terms of particle size, size distribution and particle morphology. Smaller particles were produced at higher temperature and pressure, and with a lower initial concentration of the solution. A lower liquid solution flow rate is recommended to obtain submicron particles but the CO2 flow rate and nozzle diameter had a negligible effect on particle size, at least at the levels evaluated. The precipitated powders were analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The SAS process contributed to the dehydration of rutin, thus conferring higher added value. Moreover, amorphization of the processed samples was produced during the process. Processed rutin particles dissolved more rapidly than commercial rutin in simulated fluids and this is related to the particle size reduction and the loss of crystallinity due to amorphization. This effect was more pronounced in simulated intestinal fluids than in gastric fluids.",

     "abstract": "In Europe, rapeseed is a renewable raw material which has been widely used for the production of biodiesel by various processes. The transesterification reaction of rapeseed oil with ethanol to biodiesel in supercritical fluid conditions was investigated using several heterogeneous catalysts and preliminary ultrasonic emulsification of the reaction mixture, to run the reaction at mild conditions. Phase equilibrium of fatty acids in supercritical ethanol was study to determine the operating condition in supercritical states. Transesterification experiments were carried out under a pressure of 30\u00a0MPa, with ethanol to oil molar ratio (in the range of 12:1\u2fff20:1), temperature (623\u00a0K to 653\u00a0K), and the catalyst loading level and type were the main parameters. The most important characteristics of Al2O3 support catalyst and the impregnation method with aqueous solution of metal nitrates are also described. Yields of Fatty Acids Ethyl Ester (FAEE) are reported for different ZnO/Al2O3, MgO/Al2O3, SrO/Al2O3 catalysts in different experimental conditions. The higher yield of 97.46% was obtained under the optimal conditions 623\u00a0K, 30\u00a0MPa, 12:1 ethanol/FAEE molar ratio, with SrO/Al2O3 (2\u00a0wt.% SrO) impregnated catalyst.",

The size of the boehmite particles formed after hydrothermal treatment between 200 and 400\u00a0\u00b0C in a batch reactor was measured after various treatment times (several minutes to 1\u00a0h). The growth rate was evaluated from the increase in the size of boehmite particles with time. Kinetic analysis was conducted over the initial stage of particle growth (up to 10\u00a0min). The effect of diffusion rate on particle growth was evaluated at 400\u00a0\u00b0C and 30\u00a0MPa to reconfirm its insignificance, suggesting that the surface reaction is the controlling step under these conditions. The apparent activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plot of growth rate coincides well with the values reported in the literature. Addition of octanoic acid to the system significantly enhances particle growth. The effect of octanoic acid concentration on the rate constant was studied in more detail: the concentration dependence implies the formation of an intermediate with the octanoic acid, which controls particle growth.",

Gasification has been investigated using a 200\u00a0cm3 down flow reactor working continuously. The effect of microalgae slurry concentration, with or without alkali catalysts, was studied. Moreover, the role played by different constituents of microalgae on gasification was investigated. Particularly, gasification of amino acids, carbohydrates and model mixtures among them was studied. Nannochloropsis gaditana was successfully gasified up to 97.4\u00a0wt% as gasification efficiency and 86.0\u00a0wt% as carbon efficiency. The product gas is mainly composed of hydrogen (52.0%), methane (17.9%) and CO2 (23.0%). Gasification of pure amino acids, which are the main components of microalgae, showed a very different resistance to gasification depending on the molecular structure of the molecules. Among the amino acid that have been studied in this work, gasification resistance is in the order glycine\u00a0>\u00a0leucine\u00a0>\u00a0glutamic acid, whereas CH4 concentration increases in order leucine\u00a0>\u00a0glutamic acid\u00a0>\u00a0glycine due to the number of methyl groups that are present in the molecules. From this work it can be concluded that gasification of microalgae is feasible in a continuous mode and that, depending on their molecular structure, amino acids offer a different resistance to gasification. These results can be of help in evaluating the feasibility of gasification of defatted microalgae after extraction of the oil.",

The effectiveness of the in situ compatibilization with scCO2 on the phase dispersion and mechanical properties was studied via comparison with that of the other approaches of thermal blending without scCO2, thermal blending with scCO2 and in situ compatibilization without scCO2. In the in situ compatibilization with scCO2, trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and dibenzoyl peroxide (BPO) were applied as polyfunctional monomer and radical initiator, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to confirm the formation of the block and/or graft copolymers (PP-b-PS and/or PP-g-PS) during reactive extrusion and further to study the effect of scCO2 on the yield of the interfacial modifiers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied to observe the phase dispersion of the PP/PS blends prepared via different approaches and thus to analyze the functions of scCO2 in improving the phase dispersion in the in situ compatibilization. Impact tests were carried out with samples prepared via different approaches without and with thermal annealing to confirm the effectiveness of in situ compatibilization with scCO2. The results showed that the interfacial modifiers were in situ formed during reactive extrusion, and that the yield was increased with scCO2. It was further found that scCO2 could improve the phase dispersion and thus the mechanical properties of the PP/PS blends prepared via in situ compatibilization through two functions: scCO2-assisted phase dispersion and scCO2-promoted in situ compatibilization. Therefore, the better phase dispersion of the PP/PS blends prepared via in situ compatibilization with scCO2 could be attributed to the two functions of scCO2 as well as a basic thermal blending and a primary in situ compatibilization. Thus, compared to the other approaches, in situ compatibilization with scCO2 has proved to be a more effective approach in improving phase dispersion and enhancing mechanical properties.",

The conversion of lignite was studied under the pressure 24\u00a0MPa in two temperature range: 290\u2013360 and 390\u2013500\u00a0\u00b0C without and with additives. Calculation of the activation energies of the reactions of gases formations had shown that NiO-MoO3-Al2O3 had acted as a catalyst, sodium and calcium hydroxides had behaved as reactants. The general scheme of the mechanism on formation of the gas products containing H2, CH4 and CO2 was examined. It was shown that at the subcritical temperature the gas products were formed mainly from hydrogen of coal and oxygen of mineralized water. Carbon of lignite behaves like an acid, and water is as a base at the subcritical temperature; they switch their roles at the supercritical temperature. 80% of hydrogen and oxygen of gas products were of water origin at the supercritical temperature. C, O and H conversions at initial rates of reactions with gases distribution have been synchronously analyzed for primary reactions clearing. It had found that the gasification of lignite-water suspension under the supercritical pressure had at least four types of interactions: thermal decomposition of coal, carbon oxidation by oxygen of water as well as hydrolysis and hydrocracking of coal. Oxidation of carbon was dominant for the process at the subcritical temperature on water. Hydrolysis of CC bonds of coal was the main at the supercritical parameters of water.",

     "abstract": "Methanol is found to be a major product when glycerol decomposes under supercritical water conditions. Glycerol is a significant byproduct of biodiesel waste streams, the value of which is decreasing as biodiesel output increases. The transformation of glycerol into methanol, which is a feedstock for biodiesel production, would potentially reduce the costs and climate impact of biodiesel production. The highest yield of methanol was found at 450\u00a0\u00b0C, 300\u00a0bar after 30\u00a0min residence time. Addition of ethylsulfide increases the rate but does not improve the methanol yield. At longer residence times, methanol and acetaldehyde were consumed and acetic acid was produced. The generation of significant quantities of methanol (non-catalytically) from glycerol was not previously observed, and thus no mechanism for methanol production had been proposed in the published literature. A detailed kinetic model for the glycerol plus supercritical water system was constructed using the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software package. All the parameter values in this large model were predicted a priori based on quantum chemistry calculations; none were adjusted to try to match our data, which serves as a test set for the model predictions. The a priori kinetic model predicts yields of acrolein, acetic acid and acetaldehyde similar to those measured by previous researchers. However, the model underpredicted the yield of methanol measured in our experiments. We speculate that the generation of higher concentrations of methanol in our experiments than in prior work might be due to catalytic reactions on the reactor walls, since our reactor has different metallurgy than those used in prior studies.",

Phosphonium based ionic liquids are good solvents for carbon dioxide and are better alkali promoters.

Here, based on the substantial role of charged surface residues such as lysines in enzyme inactivation, we introduced for the first time, Post Translational Modifications (PTMs), a famous concept in molecular biology, as a protein stabilization strategy in supercritical condition. Lysine groups were modified using PTM templates to find out more about the exact mechanism of enzyme inactivation in supercritical CO2 and to explore a new way for protein stabilization in this solvent. We used MD simulation as common tool for in situ examining enzyme structure in supercritical fluids, for the investigation of structural consequence of modifications. Different modifications including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and carboxylation have been applied on the model enzyme. For comparison to CALB structure in supercritical CO2, the acetylated enzyme was also simulated in aqueous solvent at 300 and 353\u00a0K. Interestingly, acetylation of lysine residues prevents enzyme from denaturation at high temperatures in water, which is in agreement with experimental observation in aqueous solution. However, acetylation is not so useful for stabilization of enzyme in supercritical CO2. In contrast, methylation and carboxylation efficiently stabilize enzyme in supercritical CO2. Phosphate groups in phosphorylated lysines destabilize enzyme by formation of excess hydrogen bonds by inappropriate groups and perturb enzyme conformation. Moreover, it was found that modification of surface arginine residues was not so satisfactory in stabilization of the enzyme. This finding supports the mechanism of lipase inactivation through direct interaction of CO2 molecules on lysine residues and formation of carbamates. We think this new exploration can open new window for developing enzyme catalyzed mechanism of enzyme inactivation in scCO2.",

Full-bundle tests for the SCWR fuel assembly are not yet available; therefore, partial-bundle tests with a reduced number of rods and a shortened channel length were considered in the assessment. Three heat transfer experiments at supercritical pressures were selected for the assessment: (i) a Japanese 7-rod bundle water experiment; (ii) a Chinese 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 rod bare-bundle water experiment; and (iii) a Russian 7-rod bare-bundle Freon experiment. The rod surface temperature was taken as the key parameter in the assessment since the maximum fuel cladding temperature is a key criterion used in developing the SCWR fuel assembly concept. The ASSERT-PV predictions of rod surface temperature were compared against experimental data of measured wall temperatures. Six widely-known heat transfer correlations were assessed for their suitability in predicting the wall temperatures in rod bundles under conditions relevant to the Canadian SCWR.

It has already been studied for decades and, nowadays there are several demonstration and industrial plants under construction worldwide. Simulation tools play an important role, both to predict and optimize the operating conditions during the process and to evaluate its economic viability. In the case of SCWO, transitory state models are sparse in the literature. In order to exhaustively know the behavior of the SCWO process during time-dependent applications, a transitory tubular reactor model has been built. That model has been developed by the finite difference method in two dimensions. It takes into account the reaction of wastewater along the reactor and the heat loss from the fluid to the atmosphere in a radial way, both along the pipe and through the isolation material.In order to validate the model, a set of experiments under different operating conditions were carried out in a pilot plant. Their aim was to characterize the heat loss in the system to fit both simulated and experimental data in steady state. Then, the transitory model is tested and typically time-dependent applications at industrial scale are analysed under different operating conditions (varying feed concentrations, reactor inlet temperature or amount of cooling water injection). In each case, the model results are collected and they show the time variation according to the changes in operating parameters such as temperature, feed concentration or heat loss along the reactor. The model developed can also be used for other technologies based on supercritical water, such as supercritical water gasification.",

The polymeric matrix was processed with supercritical CO2 and the system was rapidly depressurized to cause supersaturation of the polymer, leading nucleation and growth of the pores in the matrix. Even though saturation temperatures close to the melting points of the polymers are required to form porous matrices of semicrystalline polymers, we obtained porous PLLA with porosity up to 40% by using CO2-philic trifluoropropyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (TFPOSS) as an additive to induce formation of pores at 313\u00a0K that is about 130\u00a0K lower than PLLA\u2019s melting point. This is the first time that PLLA with crystallinity greater than 30% foamed with the supercritical fluid at a temperature close to its critical temperature. PLLA without the additive did not result in a porous matrix once it was processed under the same conditions. A non-CO2-philic POSS was also used to observe the influence of CO2-philicity, which did not induce formation of pores in the matrix under the same conditions. Additive concentration (10\u201330\u00a0wt%), saturation temperature (313\u2013393\u00a0K), saturation pressure (10.3\u201320.7\u00a0MPa), venting rate (0.2\u201310.3\u00a0MPa\u00a0min\u22121), and saturation time (2\u201324\u00a0h) were among the studied process parameters. Saturation temperature and additive concentration were observed to have significant effects on the porosity and the average pore size of the polymeric matrix, while venting rate had an effect only on the average pore size.

     "abstract": "Generally, there are different enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. One of the most promising EOR method is the gas injection especially carbon dioxide (CO2) injection since it introduce several unique characteristic desired for higher tertiary oil recovery. In this study, the performance and feasibility of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and supercritical nitrogen (SC-N2) injection to enhanced oil recovery was investigated. In this regard, swelling tests and core flooding experiments were performed to find out whether the injections of these gases are efficient to recover trapped oil in the reservoir. Based on the experimental results, the possible active mechanisms were discussed on both displacements. The results of swelling tests showed that SC-CO2 yields the swelling factor up to about 35%, while the oil swelling factor by SC-N2 is just about 8%. The core-flooding experimental results demonstrated that SC-CO2 injection could recover 15.8% of the original oil in place (OOIP), while SC-N2 injection ultimate oil recovery would be up to 8.7% of the OOIP.",

In this work, batch foaming of PCL using supercritical CO2 was employed, and the effects of processing variables, namely soaking time, foaming temperature and pressure, depressurization rate on the pore morphology and structure were studied in detail. Results demonstrated that morphologies and structures of pores were significantly distinct astride foaming temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C, which were characterized by melt-state foaming and solid-state foaming respectively. The dramatic reduction of melting temperature (Tm) caused by the presence of supercritical CO2 was found to be the key for this specific phenomenon. Above 40\u00a0\u00b0C, the enhanced melting of PCL caused by the reduction of Tm led to wider pore size distribution, i.e. melt-state foaming, and the domino effect of variables on pore size was amplified; whilst below 40\u00a0\u00b0C the foams showed dense and small pore morphology, i.e. solid-state foaming. By tuning processing variables, scaffolds with diameter of 12.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 to 344\u00a0\u00b1\u00a054\u00a0\u03bcm and porosity of 60.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2% to 83.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3% were fabricated.

The effect of temperature (40\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C) and the amount of CO2 (100\u2013200\u00a0g) passed through the high-pressure column on the (micro)structure and the purity of TiO2 thin films were examined at pressure of 30\u00a0MPa. Prepared thin films were characterized with respect to the structural properties and purity by Raman spectroscopy. The most promising thin films were analysed with respect to microstructural properties by means of X-ray diffraction to determine the phase composition, the crystallite-size and the crystallite-size distribution. High temperature had a positive effect on the crystallization as well as the purity of TiO2 thin films during the one step and multi-step processing. When TiO2 thin films were exposed to water-modified supercritical CO2 and temperature of 150\u00a0\u00b0C under pressure of 30\u00a0MPa, the desired crystalline structure of anatase was obtained. The anatase crystallites growth was mainly influenced by the presence of water. Anatase crystallites sizes of 2\u201312\u00a0nm were obtained depending on the processing method on both investigated substrates (soda-lime glass and monocrystalline Si) on which the TiO2 thin films were deposited. Using one step or multi-step processing by water-modified supercritical CO2 any undesirable effects such as Na+ ions diffusion from the soda-lime glass substrate to the one-layer TiO2 film, having negative effect on crystallization of anatase, did not take place. The universality of developed processing by pure and water-modified supercritical CO2 for preparation of TiO2 anatase thin films was successfully confirmed for two different substrates.",

The yield of extract as well as its composition were determined and analyzed for different solvent consumption defined as mass of used CO2 for extraction per mass of dry fenugreek seeds. A central composite design (CCD) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the best extraction conditions which determined that 27.0\u00a0MPa, 42.6\u00b0\u00a0C, and 24.6\u00a0gCO2/gdm were the optimal conditions for isolation of total extract.

The carbon-coated LFP (C-LFP) exhibited hierarchical porous nano/micro sphere morphology with a porosity of 45.6%. In comparison with bare LFP synthesized in the absence of oleylamine, C-LFP exhibited excellent Li ion uptake performance; C-LFP delivered a reversible discharge capacity of 158.4\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 after 100 cycles at 0.1\u00a0C and a rate performance of 84.0\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 at 20\u00a0C. In addition, after 700 continuous cycles at 10\u00a0C, the C-LiFePO4 electrode exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of 84.0\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 with small capacity loss. Electrochemical impedance tests revealed that the uniform and ultrathin carbon coating improved charge transfer kinetics and lithium diffusion into the active material.",

It was found that salicylic and acetylsalicylic acids form stable hydrogen-bonded complexes with methanol through hydrogen atom of the carboxyl group. In methyl salicylate molecule the carboxyl hydrogen is substituted by methyl radical, that is why strong hydrogen bonds with methanol are not typical for it. Salicylamide is able to form hydrogen bonds with methanol through several functional groups (preferably as proton donor), but their probability and lifetimes are lower than those for salicylic acid \u2013 methanol and acetylsalicylic acid \u2013 methanol hydrogen bonds. The continuous rearrangement of salicylamide solvation shell due to forming and breaking solute \u2013 cosolvent hydrogen bonds was observed. Sodium salicylate is in the form of undissociated ion pair in supercritical carbon dioxide, despite the presence of a polar co-solvent, but it is characterized by very high selective solvation. It is able to form hydrogen bonds with several (up to 6) methanol molecules simultaneously. Unlike other compounds considered, it forms highly stable hydrogen bonds as a proton acceptor.",

The corrosion impact factor was defined which showed that NO2 or SO2 had the greatest influence on the corrosion of X65 steel, followed by H2S and O2. Localized corrosion occurred in water-saturated supercritical CO2 system containing NO2 with or without other impurities.

Economical modifications of the commercial interfacial apparatus were implemented to pre-saturate the [Emim][BF4] phase by CO2 for the measurement of interfacial tension and production of small sessile droplets for contact angle measurements. The interfacial tension was found to be mainly dependent on CO2 solubility in the [Emim][BF4] phase, and a linear fitting equation was proposed. The contact angles of the [Emim][BF4] phase on quartz, 316L stainless steel, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in CO2 atmosphere were analyzed to predict the interfacial tension differences between CO2/solid and IL/solid phases. The reduction of interfacial tension difference was caused by increased CO2 solubility in the [Emim][BF4] phase at low pressure for quartz and 316L stainless steel dense solids.

The main purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the published studies that are relevant to the flow behavior and heat transfer characteristics of scCO2. The review of available works display that the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of heat exchangers using scCO2 as working fluid rely on many parameters such as tube shape and size, mass flux, inlet temperature and pressure, type of process (heating or cooling) etc. Moreover, application of scCO2 in cooling and heating processes and the available empirical correlations for heat transfer are also discussed. Overall it is observed that as the inlet pressure increases, the density and viscosity increases. Thus, when the temperature is higher than the critical temperature the pressure drop decreases with increasing inlet pressure. On the other hand, in heating, the heat transfer rate ( Q \u02d9 ) of scCO2 decreases as the inlet temperature increases above the critical temperature for all supercritical pressures. In cooling, Q \u02d9 of scCO2 reaches peak value at near critical pressure and decreases as the inlet pressure increases. This review paper can provide information for further investigations on scCO2.",

Besides biocompatibility, non-toxicity and biodegradability, dry powders must fulfil main particle requirements in terms of performance delivery in order to be considered suitable carriers for dry pulmonary therapeutics, such as size, density and aerodynamic properties. The development of such particles typically involves a complex process of optimization. In this work a design of experiments approach (DoE) was used to study the effect of supercritical CO2-assisted spray-drying (SASD) operational parameters in the final properties of composite chitosan (CHT) microparticles. The effect of CO2 to liquid flow ratio (R), atomization temperature and the co-atomization of a model active ingredient, ibuprofen (IBP), was studied with respect to the particle volumetric diameter (Dv,50), span, mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), fine particle fraction (FPF), geometric standard deviation (GSD) and emitted fraction (EF). The in vitro aerosolization profile of the powders was assessed using an Anderson Cascade Impactor (ACI) equipment able to simulate the deposition of the particles in the lungs. In addition, in vitro release studies from the composite particle formulations were performed and modelled using the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation, as well as lysozyme biodegradation experiments. We were able to develop dry chitosan composite particles with suitable characteristics for the delivery of active ingredients to the lungs. Design of experiments approach was able to statistically correlate the operational conditions with the final characteristics of the formulation.",

The main parameters that influence this process were identified in order to carry out a subsequent coprecipitation using eudragit as a coating agent. The initial concentration of the solution and temperature play a significant role in the powder precipitation of ellagic acid; powders did not precipitate at concentrations below 20\u00a0mg/mL and temperatures above 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Higher CO2 and liquid solution flow rates together with smaller nozzle diameters are recommended in order to obtain smaller particles of ellagic acid. Taking into account these results, coprecipitates of ellagic acid and eudragit in different ratios were obtained under the best operating conditions. The coprecipitates were formed as spherical microparticles of eudragit surrounding sticks and flowers of ellagic acid. Dissolution profiles for commercial ellagic acid and processed microparticles were obtained in simulated fluids together with the release profiles of the coprecipitates. Commercial ellagic acid had a poor dissolution profile in simulated fluids. In general, ellagic acid was dissolved or released to a greater extent in simulated gastric fluids than in simulated intestinal fluids. Coprecipitates had faster release than microparticles of ellagic acid alone. The crystallinity and stability of SAS-processed ellagic acid remained unchanged.",

A well resolved DNS eliminates the uncertainty brought by turbulence modeling. The small pipe diameter (D\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm, 2\u00a0mm) with a moderately low inlet Reynolds number (Re0\u00a0=\u00a05400) can be compared to the channel flow in a compact heat exchanger, e.g. a printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE). In our simulation, the inflow temperature T0 is set to be lower than the pseudo-critical temperature Tpc. The thermo-physical properties change rapidly when the fluid temperature rises across Tpc under heating conditions. In the present DNS, the wall temperature T w is found to be variable in the circumferential direction. The magnitude of T w is higher at top than at the bottom surface. As a result of buoyancy, flow stratification with low density in the upper region of pipe is developed. The streamwise velocity field U \u02dc z is also modified by the flow stratification. Low-velocity flow near the circumferential wall is heated firstly and transported to the top region by the secondary flow. High-velocity bulk fluid is concentrated at the bottom as a result of high density. It is also observed that the turbulent kinetic energy and the radial turbulent heat flux are strongly suppressed near the top surface. The attenuated momentum transport and heat transfer enhance the flow stratification. A further analysis shows a significantly decreased turbulence production in this position.",

     "abstract": "Herbal medicinal plants are important sources of bioactive, medicinal compounds. In this work, impregnation of phytol as a model compound and multicomponent Clinacanthus nutans (C. nutans) plant extracts into alginate and silica aerogels was investigated, applying two different methods: wet impregnation and supercritical impregnation. Two types of C. nutans extracts were prepared by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) using either ethanol-water solvent mixtures or pure ethanol as solvent. The impregnated compounds were analyzed by Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and chromatography (HPLC and UPLC\u2013MS/MS). Results showed that supercritical impregnation method yielded the highest loading content with silica aerogels, with a content of 30.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0wt% of the model compound phytol, and 11.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 and 23.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0wt% of the extracts obtained with ethanol/water and pure ethanol solvents, respectively. In the wet impregnation method, alginate aerogels exhibited higher loading than the silica aerogels regardless of their surface area properties, indicating that in this case other properties of carrier materials and the nature of compounds have a stronger influence on the compounds loading than the surface properties of the carrier. Impregnation in alginate aerogels yielded higher total phenols and flavonoids contents than in silica aerogels. Plasticized alginate biopolymer was formed when the supercritical impregnation was performed with excess of phytol at 200\u00a0bar and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating that the swelling and/or plasticizing effect of SCCO2 was remarkable combined with the effect of excess solute. Release kinetics results indicate that the alginate aerogel impregnated with the extract obtained with pure ethanol is suitable for controlled drug release whereas the alginate aerogel impregnated with the ethanol/water extract is more appropriate for fast release purposes. The release kinetics results were fitted into several mathematical models: zero order, first order and Higuchi model, to evaluate the mechanism of the release. Results showed that diffusion and erosion and/or swelling control the release of extract from the aerogels.",

A qualitative gas chromatography (GC) analysis showed that the individual FAMEs extracted varied depending on the co-solvent (methanol or hexane) used with supercritical CO2. Using hexane, FAME compounds produced were similar to those extracted with soxhlet extraction alone while longer chain FAME were produced when methanol was the co-solvent. The effects of pressure and temperature variations were shown to be of statistical significance. The chromatograms produced in this work demonstrate that altering one of these parameters (co-solvent, temperature, pressure) can produce different compounds owing to the tunability of the technique.",

The influence of scCO2 sorption capacity on the amount of borage oil impregnated/deposited into the PUR foamed matrix was studied for selected pressure and temperature conditions and based on scCO2 sorption data. Results showed that the highest solubility of scCO2 in PUR (\u223c70%) was achieved at the lowest temperature and highest solvent density studied (308\u00a0K and 850\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123) while the highest borage oil loaded yield was observed at the highest temperature and solvent density studied (328\u00a0K and 850\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123), meaning that the impregnation/deposition process is controlled by the solubility of borage oil in scCO2. All the compounds present in borage oil (and which are detected by HPLC) were successfully loaded into the PUR matrix which confirms the feasibility of the impregnation/deposition process. Moreover, the amount of loaded oil did not significantly affect the neat properties of the PUR matrix (mainly its hydrophobicity, thermal resistance and water vapor permeation capacity).",

In this clinical scenario, banking decellularised organs ready for transplantation would be mandatory for patients with emergency needs.In this work a new process based on supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) drying technique was investigated for obtaining a dry/preserved decellularized oesophagus. Experiments were performed coupling a detergent enzymatic treatment with two different protocols: (i) SC-CO2 drying; (ii) dehydration in ethanol and a subsequent SC-CO2 drying. The efficiency of the treatments was investigated by monitoring the loss of weight of the treated samples and the maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture, composition and mechanical properties after rehydration.A successful dry acellular matrix was reached in a shorter time using the combined ethanol and SC-CO2 treatment. Histological analysis reported the maintenance of the tissue matrix architecture and the collagen content for all the treated samples, while the preservation of ultrastructural features were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tensile tests did not show significant differences in terms of fracture strength before and after the supercritical process. Furthermore, the scaffolds demonstrated good biocompatible properties in terms of cell culture viability in vitro. Overall, the results highlighted the potential of this novel technology to obtain a dried acellular matrix for oesophageal regeneration, preserving the extracellular matrix structure of the native tissue.",

The mixtures comprising aromatic and aliphatic alkanols, esters, ethers and ketones have been treated in the entirely predictive manner, without adjusting any binary parameters. The results indicate that both models under consideration are particularly accurate estimators of single phase liquid densities at high pressures, usually with slight superiority of GC-PPC-SAFT. Nevertheless the universality of CP-PC-SAFT could be considered as more advanced since this model yields accurate predictions also for sound velocities and compressibilities.

Influence of operating parameters including pressure (P\u00a0=\u00a0100\u2013220\u00a0bar), temperature (T\u00a0=\u00a0308\u2013328\u00a0K), particle size (dp\u00a0=\u00a00.3\u20130.9\u00a0mm) and dynamic extraction time (t\u00a0=\u00a030\u2013150\u00a0min) on final response was evaluated. The experimental values were adequately fitted to a quadratic polynomial equation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated that all factors were significantly affected the extraction yield of essential oil from C. coluteoides. Using a grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, the optimal operating conditions were determined to be P\u00a0=\u00a0220\u00a0bar, T\u00a0=\u00a0308\u00a0K, dp\u00a0=\u00a00.58\u00a0mm and t\u00a0=\u00a0135\u00a0min, under which conditions, the maximum yield of 0.6589 was obtained. Chemical compositions extracted by hydro-distillation (HD) and SC-CO2 methods were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and determined by GC/FID. Comparing the two methods, the obtained results showed higher total extraction yield with SC-CO2 technique.",

The results show that the SFE extracts present a significantly higher antioxidant capacity. The extracts were characterized and quantified by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS methods. The bioactive compounds identified in all the extracts were phenolic acids (only in the LPE extracts), flavonoids and anthocyanins (only in the SFE extracts). The results indicate that the higher antioxidant capacity of the SFE myrtle extracts is mainly correlated with the concentration of flavonol glycosides, the myricetin-O-glycosides.",

The X-ray diffractometery (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated that the obtained nanoparticles with a satisfactory size and morphology were synthesized under supercritical condition. VR cracking experiments were also conducted in a batchwise reactor under operating condition, namely temperature: 450\u00a0\u00b0C, reaction time: 60\u00a0min, catalyst/oil ratio (g/g): 1/5, and water/oil ratio (g/g): 80/3.

The effects of coking and active component leaching on catalytic activities are quantitatively discussed. The catalytic activity of NbTi did not decrease significantly with time at both pressures. At 25\u00a0MPa, the coke precursors on the NbTi surface dissolved in the supercritical water because of the middle-strength acidity of NbTi, thus preventing loss of catalytic activities due to coking. At 33\u00a0MPa, coking was more suppressed, most likely because the coke precursors were transferred from the catalyst pores more effectively than at 25\u00a0MPa.

The extraction rate on samples that had over a mass fraction of 30% moisture content was greatly reduced.

Among them, Pongamia pinnata oil, also known as Karanja oil, is considered as a good candidate with potential availability of more than 135\u00a0Mtpa. The present work offers an in-depth study of the transesterification reaction of Karanja oil in supercritical methanol in one-step catalyst-free process. Triglyceride (TG) conversion and the yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) are analyzed in the temperature and reaction time ranges of 250\u2013350\u00a0\u00b0C (12\u201343\u00a0MPa) and 15\u201390\u00a0min, respectively, at an alcohol-to-oil molar ratio of 43:1.

Optimal reactions conditions were found at 300\u00a0\u00b0C and 90\u00a0min reaction with almost complete triglyceride conversion. Significant thermal decomposition was observed from 325\u00a0\u00b0C, mainly caused by the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters. Maximum degree of thermal decomposition of 38% was determined at 350\u00a0\u00b0C after 90\u00a0min reaction time.",

     "abstract": "Neochloris oleoabundans emerges as alternative source of bioactives that complies with the algae-based biorefinery concept, which consists of a platform that offers a multitude of algae bioproducts. The development of an integrated extractive processes in line with the green chemistry principles have motivated the use of Supercritical CO2 (scCO2), as an alternative to toxic organic solvents, for the extraction of bioactives. However, process integration and optimization is challenging because microalgae are grown in liquid cultures, therefore is often necessary a drying step prior to scCO2 extraction. Moreover, this step is usually energy intensive and risks damaging the compound's bioactivity. An alternative is the simultaneous extraction process of the microalgae paste (containing around 70\u201380% water), nevertheless little information is available that explores this type of extraction. This work aims to explore the direct extraction of microalgae paste and to evaluate the effect of water on carotenoid extractions of N. oleoabundans. To study the extraction under a batch-wise system, an indirect extraction system was developed by mixing the microalgae paste with low cost adsorbents as support medium. Two types of silica gels, two different chitosans and active carbon were tested as adsorbents; sea sand was used as inert control. All of the materials showed different adsorbent capacity, being chitosan adsorbents those with higher capacity. However, oleoresin yield and recovery was negligible in a system with only scCO2 as a solvent and ethanol as co-solvent was required to improve the extraction yield. Although the overall oleoresin recoveries were low for all adsorbents (ranging from 2 to 10%), chitosan-assisted extraction showed the highest carotenoid recoveries (60\u2013140% g/g) surpassing acetone benchmark extraction in case of chitosan microspheres. These results are interesting for the development of low energy consumption processes, since there is no need to dry the microalgal paste.",

The re-use of an agroindustrial residue (chia seed cake) for obtaining extracts rich in bioactive compounds (high added value), mainly using the supercritical technology, is a novelty. Published studies on this subject have not been found. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was performed at pressures from 150 to 300\u00a0bar and temperatures of 40\u201350\u00a0\u00b0C, using CO2 as solvent or CO2 added to ethanol (EtOH) or ethyl acetate (EtOAc) as cosolvents at 2.5\u20137.5% w/w of the total CO2 mass. Extracts obtained by SFE were compared to extracts obtained by low-pressure techniques (LPE), using hexane, EtOH, and EtOAc as solvents. All extracts were evaluated as antioxidant content (ABTS and DPPH methods), total phenolics content (TPC), fatty acids profile (GC-FID) and in vitro antimicrobial activity analysis. SFE assays using pure CO2 reached yields up to 10.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2% at 300\u00a0bar and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. SFE with 7.5% of EtOH increased the process yield and TPC of the extract.

GC-FID confirmed the high content of linoleic and \u03b1-linolenic acids (\u223c80% together), and the presence of palmitic, stearic and oleic acids, in minor amounts for all of the extract samples evaluated. It was noted that chia seed cake extracts presented the same quality that whole chia seed extracts, studied by other authors. Extracts obtained by different techniques also showed weak antimicrobial activity against B. cereus.

Both visual and Raman spectroscopic investigations suggest that a reversible strong UO22+\u2013SO42\u2212 association was responsible for the liquid\u2013liquid immiscibility in aqueous UO2SO4 solutions. Main evidences were summarized as: (1) the liquid\u2013liquid phase separation temperature decreases with increasing UO2SO4 concentration up to 0.54\u00a0mol/kg, and then increased at greater concentrations, characterizing a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at 285.8\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0C. LCST is commonly accepted as a diagnostic feature of polymer solutions; (2) analyses of the shapes of the Raman spectra of v1(UO22+) and v1(SO42\u2212) bands show that the UO22+\u2013SO42\u2212 association becomes stronger at elevated temperatures, especially in the immiscible Urich phase; and (3) with increasing temperature, the Urich phase becomes more concentrated, whereas the Upoor phase becomes more dilute, indicating that the hydration of UO22+ and SO42\u2212 cannot be maintained in the Urich phase. Destruction of the hydration spheres of UO22+ and SO42\u2212 further favors the ion association in the Urich phase.

     "abstract": "The objective of this research was to investigate the decomposition and decoloration of textile wastewater by hydrothermal treatment. We studied the hydrothermal oxidation of methyl orange aqueous solution using a flow-type reactor packed with MnO2 catalyst. Hot steam (vapor) and subcritical water (liquid) were used in the reactor as the decomposition media at the reaction temperature and pressure of 200\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C and 1 or 10\u00a0MPa, respectively. When methyl orange solution with 300\u00a0mg/L of total organic carbon (TOC) was used, nearly complete decomposition of methyl orange was realized in hot steam at 300\u00a0\u00b0C, 1\u00a0MPa, 10\u00a0s, and 1.5 oxygen supply ratio, i.e., a much higher TOC decomposition rate was obtained at a lower reaction pressure and shorter residence time than those obtained with subcritical water oxidation. The kinetic modeling of hydrothermal oxidation of the model wastewater containing methyl orange was also investigated. The kinetic model to calculate TOC conversion at a given residence time was proposed based on the regression from the complete set of data. In the case of hot steam oxidation, a second-order kinetic model was used to describe the TOC conversion. However, a two-step first-order kinetic model (a rapid first reaction followed by a slow second reaction) was needed to describe the kinetics of subcritical water oxidation. Both reaction rate expressions were successfully used to estimate the TOC concentrations at any residence time at 90% confidence level.",

The selected time for emulsion injection into the SFEE system was 10\u00a0min after its preparation, based on the coalescence kinetics. The SFEE process resulted in a considerable loss of oleoresin by dissolution in the supercritical CO2 and promoted a droplet volume expansion, reflected by the increase in the diameter of the droplets in suspension. The formation of emulsions by ultrasound emulsification in the evaluated conditions showed promising results, but more studies are required to improve the SFEE process.",

The main parameters that could affect the nano- or micro-precipitation were studied using mixtures of acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide rather than 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone due to the low toxicity of DMSO. Higher CO2 and liquid solution flow rates, higher pressures, lower temperatures and lower nozzle diameter are recommended for the formation of nanoparticles. The morphologies of the precipitates were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) were carried out in an effort to assess the possible loss of crystallinity and activity of the precipitates.

It was observed that CO2 entered into the green sapwood via air or water vapour-filled cells in the latewood and then diffused into earlywood cells adjacent to the pith side of the latewood bands. The dissolved CO2 reduced the surface tension of water which facilitated the expulsion of sap. As the pressure was released, and CO2 bubbles formed and expanded, the sap flowed tangentially towards the surfaces. This accounted, in part, for the observed independence of sample size on the supercritical CO2 dewatering process.",

The tensile modulus of the PP foams decreased proportionally with the square of their relative densities and was always smaller than that of the un-foamed PP. Contrary to the tensile modulus, other properties, namely, tensile strength at break, elongation at break and impact strength of the PP foams, outperformed the un-foamed PP with margins that depended on the relative densities and cell sizes of the foams. PP foams with cell sizes less than 3\u00a0\u03bcm showed higher tensile strength at break than the un-foamed PP. During tensile deformation, cells stretched from circular shapes to elliptical ones. They collapsed or broke at very high deformation. Small cells (less than 3\u00a0\u03bcm) were found to significantly reduce the stress concentration under loading. Additionally, PP foams with cell sizes less than 10\u00a0\u03bcm showed higher elongation at break and impact strength compared with that of the un-foamed PP. During the impact, the cell size and cell density both decreased gradually along the impact direction.

The yields of volatile and liquid products and conversion residue have been found to be equal to 23.5, 62.8, and 11.9%, respectively, relative to the weight of oil supplied into the reactor. Upon SCW conversion the fraction of asphaltene in the liquid products was found to have decreased from 12 to 1\u00a0wt% while the fraction of saturated hydrocarbons increased by 4\u20135 times as much, compared to crude oil. The composition of the liquid products is defined by means of gas\u2013liquid chromatography, IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. When reactants were pumped through the cell loaded with ZnO, zinc sulfide was formed as a result of the interaction of S-containing products with ZnO accompanied by near complete removal of H2S, decrease in the S/C atomic ratio in group components of the liquid products and insignificant increase in the O/C atomic ratio and fraction of resin in the liquid products.",

However, it is still challenging to demonstrate the effect of scCO2 on water\u2013oil interface. Therefore, a molecular dynamics simulation is performed to investigate the influence of scCO2 on the water\u2013decane interface. It is observed that CO2 prefers to accumulate and display surface-active at the water\u2013decane interface. The driving force of CO2 accumulation is the IFT difference between water\u2013decane and water\u2013CO2. The IFT of water\u2013CO2\u2013decane decreases linearly with the increase of CO2. The interactions of water\u2013CO2 and decane\u2013CO2 are strong, and the difference between them is small, providing the mechanism for lowering the IFT of water\u2013decane. The increase in the diffusivity for all fluids toward the interface suggests an increase in the mobility at the water\u2013decane interface due to the addition of CO2, which is in favor of enhancing oil recovery.",

Contamination was performed in such a way to soak the whole matrix with bacteria and spores. The effect of pressure and treatment time on the efficacy of the sterilization was evaluated. The E. coli was eradicated from the whole matrix after just 5\u00a0min of exposure to supercritical CO2 at 10\u00a0MPa and 40\u00a0\u00b0C. The spores required more severe conditions due to their different and very resistant structures since complete inactivation was obtained after 360\u00a0min of exposure at 30\u00a0MPa and 40\u00a0\u00b0C or at 30\u00a0MPa and 30\u00a0\u00b0C after the addition of 200\u00a0ppm of H2O2 to near critical CO2.

Two different mixing devices (mechanical and magnetic) during DPCD treatment, and different ultrasound powers (10, 20, 30\u00a0W) during the DPCD\u00a0+\u00a0US treatment were applied. The dissolution data were then related with the inactivation ratio of Saccharomyces cerevisiae inoculated into the solutions. The results demonstrated that an increase of pressure or time during DPCD treatment enhances the amount of CO2 dissolved into the liquid, leading to a higher inactivation degree; the same trend was observed when the temperature was increased, although in this latter case, the amount of dissolved CO2 decreased. The increase of pressure during a combined DPCD\u00a0+\u00a0US treatment led to a higher amount of dissolved CO2, which positively influenced the microbial inactivation while no effect was obtained increasing the ultrasound power. Concerning the effect of the mixing devices, the mechanical stirrer was the one that enhanced the pasteurization efficiency as it influenced CO2 dissolution kinetics and, consequently, the microbial inactivation ratio. The composition of the liquid solutions also influenced the amount of dissolved CO2 but no correlations were found with S. cerevisiae inactivation.",

     "abstract": "The methane plus linear alkanes series is one of the simpler and most common type of mixtures presented in the industry and its accurate representation is paramount because of the diversity of its applications. From a theoretical perspective, its structural simplicity due to the low degree of synergy and the absence of short-range dispersive forces suggests that a good model should represent these systems with acceptable accuracy. Based on these ideas and the relatively regular behaviour of n-alkanes, these systems have become particularly suitable for trial calculation in convoluted models, in order to verify their capabilities in both quantitative and qualitative predictions. In this contribution, the soft-SAFT equation of state is used for the construction of the serial prediction domain global phase diagram (spd-GPD) of the methane plus linear alkanes series. The main goal is to address the capability of the equation of state to predict the global behaviour of the binary mixtures until methane plus n-decane, with special emphasis in accurately reproducing the mechanism and topology of mixtures. All systems shown here are predicted with quantitative accuracy, including a complete description of their taxonomy. The information obtained from the equation of state allows the validation of some predictions of the spd-GPD in the absence of experimental data. Following this analysis, the double retrograde behaviour lies between the methane plus propane and methane plus n-butane systems, while the tricritical transition of the series is found between the methane plus n-pentane and methane plus n-hexane mixtures. Also, the presence of the molar density inversion phenomenon is predicted to begin between the methane plus n-hexane and methane plus n-heptane systems, while no signals of mass density inversions are found on these mixtures.",

Static and dynamic extraction modes were compared. The use of ethanol as co-solvent proved itself fundamental for raising the extracted percentage of the desired compound. Both static and dynamic modes provided extracts with (\u2212)-\u03b1-bisabolol as the major compound, although dynamic system provided the best extraction yields. In the best experimental condition, an extraction yield equal to 0.74% was achieved, which is much higher than the yields obtained using the standard steam distillation reported in the literature. Pressure showed greater influence in the obtained (\u2212)-\u03b1-bisabolol percentage by the dynamic mode, while temperature was very important in the static system.",

     "abstract": "It is generally difficult to predict the cell structure foamed from a binary polymer blend compared to a single polymer, as many factors in polymer blends add to the complexity of the foaming process without easy control, such as blend morphology, blend viscosity, and solubility and diffusivity of the foaming agent, etc. In this study, polypropylene (PP)/polystyrene (PS) blend foams with a bimodal cell structure were prepared by using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) in continuous extrusion. By comparison of the cell structure of blend foams before and after extraction, it was found that the large cells were mainly formed in PS phase, while the small ones were mostly formed in PP phase. A possible mechanism was proposed to explain the formation of the bimodal cell structure. It was believed that a prominent difference in cell nucleation in the two phases of the PP/PS blends was required for the formation of bimodal cell structure. The proposed mechanism was confirmed by further experimental results, which showed that the bimodal cell structure could be changed by altering the nucleation ability in PP phase and PS phase through changing experimental conditions, such as the content of scCO2 and the pressure drop, or through applying a heterogeneous nucleating agent.",

In this research, hydrogen-donating capacity of water is enhanced and investigated by using heterogeneous catalyst of silica-supported iron oxide nanoparticles. Upgrading process in the absence of catalyst has been reported at Part I, where a simple comparative index, namely Hrel, was introduced in order to determine the hydrogen contribution capacity of SC-H2O versus hydrocarbons through hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds. Hexane soluble fraction (maltene) of the product was analyzed by attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR)spectroscopy, and it has revealed more than two fold increase in contribution of hydrogen of water (Hrel\u00a0=\u00a035%) in catalytic cracking with lower coke (8.4\u00a0wt%) formation, compared with non-catalytic cracking (Hrel\u00a0=\u00a016%) with 18.9\u00a0wt% of coke yield. In addition, gas chromatography analysis coupled with mass spectroscopy (GC\u2013MS) has revealed higher fractions of n-alkane in maltene produced from catalytic cracking compared with non-catalytic process. The average physical properties of the prepared maltene such as molecular weight, density and viscosity were calculated by Aspen Plus@ engineering software and they were predicted as: 87.1\u00a0g/mol, 0.69\u00a0g/ml and 0.33 cp, respectively, for the catalytic cracking, versus; 105.54\u00a0g/mol, 0.70\u00a0g/ml and 0.47 cp in non-catalytic process. The results indicate that nano iron oxide catalyst is effective towards hydrogenation of the unsaturated fragments in VR cracking by supercritical water, with less coke formation.",

Cosolvents used to modify pure solvent behavior were ethanol, methanol, acetone, and hexane. They were selected because of their different capacity to form hydrogen bonds. The effect of cosolvent type on extraction yield and oil solubility followed the order: ethanol\u00a0>\u00a0methanol\u00a0>\u00a0acetone\u00a0>\u00a0hexane. However, their efficiency to separate triglycerides from polar species showed the opposite trend: ethanol\u00a0<\u00a0methanol\u00a0<\u00a0acetone\u00a0<\u00a0hexane. Regarding the effect of cosolvent concentration, yields and solute solubilities increased with increasing values of the variable. However, the separation efficiency was almost independent of cosolvent concentration. Finally, the extraction process was further analyzed in a continuous packed column.

The effect of the initial carboxylic acid and amine concentration, pressure, temperature and process time on the extraction efficiency was investigated. The reactive extraction using TOA was found to significantly enhance the efficiency of acetic and propionic acids recovery as compared to physical extraction. It is recommended to perform the reactive extraction using scCO2 in the semi-continuous mode. It was shown that performing the process in a relatively high pressure is favourable for obtaining a high efficiency of reactive extraction of carboxylic acids.

The analysis indicates that the polar contribution of GC-PPC-SAFT has a negligibly small impact on predicting the high pressure data. Apparently, in the cases of the weakly- and non-associating compounds a major factor responsible for accuracy of the models at elevated pressures is the curvature of the dispersion contribution. At the same pressures CP-PC-SAFT tends to predict the lower values of densities and higher values of sound velocities. These predictions of CP-PC-SAFT are particularly accurate in the cases of slightly polar compounds with reliable values of the critical constants. Both models are capable of yielding only raw estimations of CP. Although CP-PC-SAFT has a clear advantage in predicting the available compressibility data, GC-PPC-SAFT is superior in qualitative estimating the isobaric thermal expansion coefficients. However the major advantage of GC-PPC-SAFT is the more accurate estimation of the vapor pressures away from the critical points.",

     "abstract": "The society and industry commitment to progressively reduce Green House Gases (GHGs) emissions forged important challenges that conventional gas separation processes are unable to overcome. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been attracting an outstanding attention during the last decade as a promising class of viable solvents to capture pollutants and for gas separation processes. Being the IL-based membranes gas separation controlled by the gas solubility in the IL rather than by its diffusivity, the solubility of gases in ILs stands as highly relevant input for their application in liquid membranes. As part of a continuing effort to develop an IL based process for high pressure capture of GHGs, the phase equilibria of nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and nitrogen (N2) were investigated in this work. Experimental gas\u2013liquid equilibrium data for N2O, CH4 and N2 in [C4C1im][N(CN)2] were determined in the (293 to 363) K temperature range, for pressures up to 70\u00a0MPa and gas mole fractions up to 35 %.Unfavorable interactions towards the studied gases, with positive deviations to ideality, were observed for all the studied gases, placing the studied IL among those with the lowest selectivities reported. The observed behavior highlights that a delicate balance between the solvent polarity and its molar volume must be ascertained when a highly selective solvent for N2 or CH4 separation is envisaged. The soft-SAFT EoS successfully described the high pressure phase behavior data using the molecular model and parameters sets reported in previous works. A good description of the binary systems studied, including the small CH4 temperature dependency and the N2 reverse temperature dependency on the solubility were achieved using just one binary interaction parameter. This reinforces the use of soft-SAFT as an accurate model to describe the behavior of gases in ILs for different applications.",

     "abstract": "Improvements to the growth of nitride crystals in ammonothermal growth environments can be achieved through improved autoclave designs, purity, and use of in situ monitoring techniques. Given the limited data available on the stability of materials in supercritical ammonia solutions, this study intends to broaden the known dataset by experimentally investigating the mechanical and chemical stability of 35 bulk metals, 2 bulk metalloids, and 17 bulk ceramics while identifying suitable materials for future in-depth corrosion studies. This was performed by exposing each material to three different supercritical ammonia solutions in nickel-chromium superalloy autoclaves held at an external wall temperature of 575\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u201312 days. The solutions were formed by initially filling the autoclave with pure ammonia (NH3), ammonia and sodium (NH3-Na), or ammonia and ammonium chloride (NH3-Cl) to achieve total system pressures of 100\u2013250\u00a0MPa. Zirconia, silicon carbide, tungsten carbide, molybdenum and its alloys, tungsten and its alloys, and a cobalt-tungsten-aluminum alloy (Co80W10.6Al9.4) appeared stable in all three environments. Vanadium, niobium, and tantalum appeared chemically stable in all environments, though these samples embrittled and gained weight. Oxides containing high concentrations of aluminum, silicon, and/or zirconium were most stable in NH3-Cl while magnesium oxide was not stable in any environment. Silicon nitride corroded in NH3-Na, yet appeared stable in NH3 and NH3-Cl. Silver and a platinum-ruthenium alloy (Pt91Ru9) appeared to be the only noble metals stable in NH3-Na while all of the noble metals investigated, except for silver, appeared to be stable in NH3-Cl. Copper and its alloys were not stable in any environment except for Constantan (Cu53Ni47) in NH3. Exposed thermocouples of type K and N remained functional post-run in NH3 and NH3-Na. Iron and nickel and their respective alloys appeared stable in NH3 and NH3-Na but not in NH3-Cl. Most other metals and metalloids investigated in this study were not stable in any of the three solutions and lost weight. Results in this study agree with literature data, where available.",

The process comprises the hyphenated on-line association of pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with supercritical antisolvent (SAS) precipitation performed in the same multipurpose equipment. The highlight of EPFO process stands for using the pressure energy applied in the extraction step as a useful energy for spraying and producing microparticles in the precipitation step. Performing EPFO process also prevents degrading bioactive compounds because the extract directly flows to the precipitation vessel, avoiding light and oxygen exposure. Then, we obtained dried microparticles as a fine powder from onion peels. After studying some different extraction conditions using ethanol, the more suitable one was found: 40\u00a0\u00b0C/120\u00a0bar for extraction step and 40\u00a0\u00b0C/100\u00a0bar for precipitation step.

     "abstract": "The foaming of polymers using supercritical fluids was investigated, both, from a theoretical and an experimental point of view. Key thermodynamic phenomena that take place during the foaming process were described using the Non Random Hydrogen Bonding (NRHB) equation-of-state, such as the supercritical fluid solubility in the polymer matrix and the plasticization profile of the polymer\u2013supercritical fluid system. Moreover, the NRHB model was combined with the classical nucleation theory in order to describe the energy barrier for nucleation. Subsequently, the foaming of the well-defined polystyrene\u2013CO2 system was experimentally studied. Porous polystyrene structures were prepared using supercritical CO2 as foaming agent at various pressure and temperature conditions that refer to constant amount of dissolved fluid (CO2) inside the polymer matrix, or to constant initial energy barrier for nucleation. The experimental results, which were discussed in the light of the aforementioned theoretical investigation, reveal that at pressure and temperature conditions of constant equilibrium solubility of CO2 inside the polymer matrix, the average pore diameter decreases with increasing foaming temperature, mainly due to the formation of more pores, which is a consequence of the decrease in the energy barrier for nucleation. Furthermore, at conditions that refer to constant initial energy barrier for nucleation, all the produced porous structures presented similar pore diameters and cell population densities, regardless of the foaming temperature. Finally, it is concluded that the energy barrier for nucleation determines the morphology of the final porous structure to a large extent, although other processing parameters, such as the foaming temperature (or pressure) and the amount of the dissolved fluid, may also influence the cell size.",

It was found that the solubility of Ln(fod)3\u00b72H2O complexes is higher than that of the corresponding Ln(hfa)3\u00b72H2O complexes and that the heavy Ln(III) complexes are more soluble than the light Ln(III) ones. These are consistent with the general tendencies that the solubility of metal complexes increases with an increase in the number of fluorine atom in their ligands and that the metal complexes largely shielded by the ligands are more soluble. Furthermore, the solubility of Ln(fod or hfa)3\u00b72H2O complexes was found to be fairly higher compared with that of other \u03b2-deketonato complexes. This was proposed to be due to the van der Waals interaction between scCO2 and the fluorine groups in Ln(fod or hfa)3\u00b72H2O rather than the solvation of CO2. From the present study, the Hfod compound was proposed to be one of promising extractant in the application of SCE method to the decontamination of radioactive wastes.",

Emulsion stability and formation were studied using a variety of techniques. In situ microscopy using a high-pressure microfluidic reactor indicated that the water/CO2 emulsion consisted of finer droplets of about 5\u00a0\u03bcm compared to the CO2/water emulsion which consisted of droplets with average diameters of about 12\u00a0\u03bcm. A partially miscible tracer technique was used to measure the dispersed phase content of the two emulsions to be about 4\u00a0vol% and up to 9\u00a0vol% for the CO2/water and water/CO2 emulsions, respectively. Engineering analysis and complementary experiments indicated that the water/CO2 emulsions formed via a two-step mechanism consisting of surface wave break-up to form a coarse emulsion followed by cavitation to form a fine emulsion. We use KI oxidation as a probe reaction to examine ultrasound-induced chemistry in the dense CO2/water system, finding that KI oxidation was suppressed by the presence of a high pressure CO2 phase. Through the combination of formation, stability, and KI oxidation experiments and analyses, we suggest that the dense CO2 cushioned cavitation bubble collapse, damping ultrasound chemical effects while permitting physical effects such as emulsification. Engineering analysis suggests energy efficient scale-up might be achieved in a carefully designed flow reactor.",

The effect of expander isentropic efficiency and position on the performance of DCFI cycle is investigated. Six double-compression refrigeration cycles are studied in the paper. The results show that the DCFI cycle performs better than DCEI cycle when the throttle valve is used as the expansion device. The replacement of the throttle valve with the expander yields less coefficient of performance (COP) improvement for DCFI cycle compared with DCEI cycle, especially at low evaporating temperatures or high gas cooler outlet temperatures. The COP of the two cycles is nearly equivalent when the isentropic efficiency of the expansion processes reaches 1.0. The DCFI cycle with only one throttle valve replaced with an expander shows lower COP compared with the corresponding DCEI expander cycle. The replacement of the main throttle valve with an expander results in higher COP compared with the auxiliary throttle valve replacement in the DCFI cycle. The substitution throttle valve for expander in the DCFI cycle is not economical compared with DCEI cycle. Furthermore, the optimum gas cooler pressure, the optimum intermediate pressure and the mass flow rate ratio are also discussed in the paper.",

     "abstract": "Classical molecular dynamics simulations are used to compute the solvation free energy of two pharmaceutical solids, namely ibuprofen and acetaminophen in carbon dioxide (CO2), over the density range of interest in supercritical processes. In order to examine the influence of the solvent model on the resulting free energies, three popular CO2 models (Zhang, EPM2, and TraPPE) are studied. Relatively large discrepancies for the solvation free energy exist between these CO2 models, suggesting that the former is sensitive to the different balances between dispersive and electrostatic forces used in these models. In particular, for the solvation of the highly polar (dipole moment of \u223c5.2\u00a0Debye) acetaminophen molecule, such discrepancies are more pronounced than for the moderately polar ibuprofen (dipole moment of \u223c1.6\u00a0D) molecule. Since there is an exponential relationship between the solvation free energy and solubility, the choice of the solvent model substantially affects the predicted solubility. For the solubility of the studied solutes, the value obtained using the TraPPE model is the highest, that of the EPM2 model is intermediate, and that of the Zhang model is the lowest. Generally, the simulations results show that the model with the largest quadrupole moment leads to a more negative solvation free energy and a higher solubility over the entire density range. Further, the decomposition of the solvation free energy into contributions stemming from electrostatics and dispersion interactions shows that the electrostatic interactions are important for a quantitative prediction of solid solubility, while the Lennard\u2013Jones parameters of the solute and solvent are more important for qualitative agreement. Additionally, the infinite-dilution partial molar volume of the two solutes is estimated from the pressure derivative of the solvation free energies. With density increasing beyond the value corresponding to the zero partial molar volume of the solute (minimum solvation free energy), the repulsive part of Lennard\u2013Jones potential wins over the attractive interactions, and the solvent strength of supercritical CO2 decreases; however, due to the increase in the chemical potential of the pure solid (effect of the Poynting correction), the solubility further increases. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of a proper choice of quadrupole moment of the solvent model, which is crucial for quantitative predictions of the solid solubility in supercritical CO2.",

This paper presents a computational study of mixing in supercritical antisolvent systems in which the enthalpy of mixing is finite. In particular we focus on the mixing of an ethanol droplet immersed in a carbon dioxide stream near and far above the critical point using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code coupled to the Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state and appropriate mixing rules. The result of mixing is investigated under different process conditions: immediately above, above and far above the mixture critical point, all under laminar flow conditions. We show how mixing is far from being isothermal due to the large enthalpy of mixing and that significant spatially distributed temperature deviations can result. In particular, the mass and heat transfer in the droplet boundary layer exhibit large temperature gradients. Besides, this local heating/cooling may be responsible for the onset of a two-phase flow under the conditions studied; a phenomenon revealed experimentally in recent studies. Two different modes of mixing between the droplet and free stream, called \u201cdeformation\u201d and \u201cstripping\u201d, are observed for the cases under study. The mixing pattern depends on the Reynolds number and significant droplet deformation is observed as the convective velocity is increased and the vorticity forming in the boundary layer between the droplet and the flow accumulates in the wake region. Our results confirm previous observations, highlighting the fact that mixing is a crucial step in nanoparticle precipitation under supercritical conditions (supercritical particle synthesis, rapid expansion of supercritical solutions, supercritical antisolvent processes, etc.) due to its effect on particle size and morphology.",

     "abstract": "A unique foaming system has been developed to explore the consequences of different pressures and temperatures employed in foaming of polymers in supercritical carbon dioxide. The cell employs a temperature gradient field extending over 25\u00a0cm. It thereby generates a continuum of temperatures to which a long strip of polymer is exposed at a given CO2 pressure in a single experiment. It allows a powerful combinatorial approach to explore foaming. This manuscript describes the experimental system and demonstrates its utility in gradient foaming of polymers using long strips (25\u00a0cm) of poly(methyl methacrylate) in thick sheet (2.1\u00a0mm) and thin film (100\u00a0\u03bcm) forms at nominal pressures of 14, 21, 28, 35\u00a0MPa under an imposed temperature gradient extending over 25\u00a0cm with a temperature difference from 40\u00a0\u00b0C to 125\u00a0\u00b0C. By generating a rich array of sections foamed at different temperatures at a given pressure, the experimental approach provides new insights not only on the pore formation and growth as a function of pressure and temperature, but also on the importance of other factors such as the time allowed or needed for CO2 sorption and escape, and the changes in the softening and vitrification state of the polymer that are important in cell nucleation, growth, or collapse. Progress of the diffusion front, which is readily identified as the boundary between the plasticized and glassy domains, is documented which provides an assessment of the diffusion coefficient as a function of temperature at a given pressure, and as a function of pressure at a given temperature.",

It is demonstrated that a bi-modal cell structure (BMCS) is obtained by the synergistic effect of temperature rising and depressurization using a varying-temperature mode (VTM). The formation mechanism for the BMCS is revealed. Cell nucleation occurs in the supercritical CO2-saturated polymer both in temperature rising and depressurizing stages. The nuclei formed in the former stage develop into large cells, whereas the ones formed in the latter stage evolve into small cells.

Optimal parameters were established by Central Composite Design and Response Surface Methodology. The yields of lipophilic and hydrophilic fractions were up to 15 and 25%, respectively. Antioxidant properties of extracts were evaluated by total phenolic content (TPC), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Polar fractions were remarkably stronger antioxidants, e.g. TPC of hexane and methanol extracts were 5.37\u201310.15 and 26.31\u201338.95\u00a0mg/g gallic acid equivalents, respectively. Raspberry pomace extracts may be promising ingredients for functional foods, nutraceuticals, cosmetics and other applications.",

The extracted samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate the effects of four independent variables (temperature, pressure, SC-CO2 flow rate, and dynamic extraction time) on the recovery of Safranal and Crocin. The recovery results indicated that the data adequately fitted into a second-order polynomial model. The optimal values of variables for Safranal extraction were determined by RSM to be 92\u00a0\u00b0C, 21.3\u00a0MPa, 0.9\u00a0cm3\u00a0min\u22121 and 122.0\u00a0min for the optimum predicted recovery of 91.76\u00a0w/w%.

The composition profiles were converted into concentration profiles using an equation of state.

However, aerogel production can be a tedious process if aerogels are made using supercritical extraction of a solvent from a sol\u2013gel matrix. We employ a new rapid and simple supercritical extraction process that is better than conventional methods. This technique relies on rapid heating of the sol in a confined mold under a 50\u00a0bar initial pressure supplied by dry N2 gas in an autoclave. The initial pre-pressure of N2 gas and base catalyst concentration dictate whether aerogels or xerogels are formed. A model is presented based on the various experimental results that predicts that gelation occurred after the solvent reached a supercritical state. Aerogels produced using this new rapid supercritical extraction process are monolithic, shrinkage-free, have a prescribed shape and size, and possess high surface area (\u223c800\u00a0m2/g) and low thermal conductivity (\u223c0.035\u20130.041\u00a0W/(m\u00a0K)).

     "abstract": "The present study is aimed to enhance the oral bioavailability of ketoprofen by inserting it into the matrix of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) K10 spatially confined into microcontainers, by means of supercritical CO2-aided impregnation. Microcontainers are cylindrical reservoirs, with typical sizes in the micrometer range, with a cavity open on one side, where the drug formulation is loaded. Differently to traditional tablets, microcontainers have a higher surface area per unit volume, and release the drug only in one direction. This design is meant to enhance the absorption of problematic drugs, like those with poor solubility in water. In a previous study we introduced a novel technique for drug loading of microcontainers, based on inkjet printing and supercritical impregnation (SCI). We showed that SCI produces accurate and reproducible drug loading for large arrays of microcontainers. In the attempt of enhancing the throughput of the loading methods, we propose the replacement of polymer inkjet printing with an easier manual compression of the PVP powder into the microcontainers. As the second step, the polymer powder filled-microcontainers were submitted to SCI. The separate role of different impregnation parameters (temperature, pressure, time, drug concentration in the supercritical phase) was elucidated with respect to the loading capacity. The microcontainer filling was observed by means of optical macroimaging, X-ray microtomography and scanning electron microscopy. The physical state of the drug was investigated by means of Raman spectroscopy and compared with selected representative PVP-ketoprofen physical mixtures. Finally, the drug loading was estimated by means of in vitro dissolution tests.The characterization study shows that the present loading method is a valuable alternative to the one previously described. The drug loading can be controlled with high accuracy and reproducibility and the impregnated drug is in amorphous state. These results demonstrate that SCI can be used as a high throughput loading technique for microfabricated devices for oral drug delivery.",

Deposition onto TaN barrier layers at temperature above 300\u00a0\u00b0C yielded high purity cobalt films as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with grain sizes of 200\u00a0nm or less. The volume resistivities, of about 200\u00a0nm thick films estimated from the surface resistivities, were about 2.5 times higher than that of the literature value of pure cobalt. Cobalt films could also be deposited on both carbon and copper surfaces with morphologies that varied depending on the amount of precursor loaded. Moreover, the cobalt film protected copper surface from oxidation in solution and also improved its resistance to oxidation in air as demonstrated respectively by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiles.",

Low density of 0.06\u00a0g\u00a0cm\u22123 and low Young's modulus of about 116\u00a0kPa distinguish these sponge-like aerogels from conventional RF-aerogels made especially by ambient drying. The synthesis occurs from a very diluted sol-solution and demands high accuracy during preparation. Formation of small particles and relatively big pores allow bending of pore walls without breaking and establish microstructural conditions of flexibility. The experiments show the microstructure formation leading to superflexible RF-aerogels is a very sensitive process and depends on the homogeneity of the sol and its pH value. Shrinkage during for instance ambient dyring induces a collapse of the pore structure and reduces flexibility. Additionally, a definition and calculation of the term \u201cflexibility\u201d is presented and discussed in this study.",

The measured desorption rates varied greatly for each VOC, which could be attributed to differences in two properties, affinity of VOCs for activated carbon and the volatility of VOCs. The measured desorption rates increased with increasing pressure and decreasing temperature, which could be explained by increasing CO2 density. A kinetic model was applied to correlate the desorption behavior. The model demonstrated satisfactory correlations of the desorption behavior with only one fitting parameter.

     "abstract": "It is believed that the unique solubility and diffusivity of organics in supercritical water (SC-H2O) have a positive influence on upgrading of heavy oil; however, the important issue would be the chemical reactivity of SC-H2O. By applying isotope labeling technique, the present study has verified the chemical role of SC-H2O as the environmentally benign hydrogen-donor solvent in cracking the petroleum vacuum residue. The high pressure batch experiments were applied at several temperatures (350\u2013450\u00a0\u00b0C) and pressures (17\u201350\u00a0MPa) keeping density constant at ca. 0.4\u00a0g/ml, respectively. After 1\u00a0h contact time between heavy water (D2O) and vacuum residue (VR) in a ratio of 80/3\u00a0g/g, the hexane soluble product (maltene) was analyzed by attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy. Substantial carbon\u2013deuterium bonding (16% relative to overall hydrogenation by water and hydrocarbon) was detected in saturated compounds (alkanes) produced from the cracking process with water, higher than 425\u00a0\u00b0C as the temperature beginning of considerable miscibility between water and oil. Accordingly, together with the modified physical properties (solvation and dispersion effects), hydrogen so formed from SC-H2O would be accessible to cover radical species formed during the cracking of asphaltenes and other oil species, and consequently reduced coke formation compared with the dry pyrolysis. This kind of in-situ hydrogen donation is in competition with hydrogen elaborated from condensation of polycyclic aromatics in the oily phase in which formation of coke is deduced. The higher portion of hydrogen by water relative to the hydrocarbon condensation causes reduction in radical addition reaction rate and suppression of coke, therefore allows the higher conversion of residues to desirable liquid products.",

Because continuous countercurrent packed columns are the devices most commonly applied to fractionate liquid mixtures (lipid mixtures, essential oils, and alcoholic beverages), this review offers general background on the use of CounterCurrent Supercritical Fluid Fractionation (CC-SFF) in packed columns. Additionally, the manuscript characterizes in detail packed column facilities in leading institutions, and describes different modes of operation of countercurrent packed columns. The manuscript also discusses less common SFF technologies for liquid mixtures such as membrane contactors, mixer-settler arrangements, and spray processes. When appropriate, the review includes extensions of these topics (e.g., special uses of static mixers in SFF of liquid mixtures). In all cases, applications, future perspectives, and developments are included. Main fractionation applications include lipid mixtures, essential oils, and alcoholic beverages. Available phase equilibrium data and relevant physical properties of mixtures that are common to all technologies are also discussed. Even though a comparison between technologies is not straightforward, considerable effort has been made to identify the characteristics that make a technology more suitable for each application. In general, mixtures with low separation factors are associated with packed columns. Mixer-settler arrangements are limited to mixtures with high separation factors and when a small number of stages (\u22645) are required for separation. An immobile interface at the pores mouth makes aqueous systems ideal for membrane contactors, and spray processes are used when handling with high viscosity mixtures.",

The microalgae used include Chlorella vulgaris (high protein and low carbohydrate contents) and Scenedesmus quadricauda (low protein and high carbohydrate contents). Time course trend of the total carbon-based gas yield of C. vulgaris and S. quadricauda was similar, showing asymptotic convex changes that may be attributed to the positive reaction order of SCWG of microalgae. In the presence of catalyst, the yield increased to 80\u201390% with time in an asymptotic way, whereas it reached only 12% in the absence of catalyst. For non-catalytic SCWG, the predominant gas product was carbon dioxide, which may be formed by decarboxylation of biomass. For catalytic SCWG, the major gas products were CH4, CO2, H2, and CO, of which composition can be explained by successive reactions of (1) hydrolytic breakdown of macromolecules to smaller organics, (2) gasification of organics to CO, CO2 and H2, (3) shift reaction of CO, and (4) methanation of CO and CO2, and their equilibrium.",

Preliminary results evidenced that the influence of temperature is weaker than pressure and ethanol content, and thus a design of experiments was performed in the ranges of 200\u2013300\u00a0bar and 0.0\u20135.0\u00a0wt.% ethanol. The optima conditions for total extraction yield (\u03b7Total) were 250\u2013300\u00a0bar and 5.0\u00a0wt.% of cosolvent, while for sterols yield (\u03b7TotalSterol) they were 300\u00a0bar and 2.5\u00a0wt.%. The latter conditions were also the most favorable to maximize the concentration of total sterols in the extracts (CTotalSterol), particularly stigmasterol (CStigm), the most abundant one. For the referred optima, \u03b7Total\u00a0=\u00a01.25 wt.%, \u03b7TotalSterol\u00a0=\u00a00.35 wt.%, CTotalSterol\u00a0=\u00a038.26 wt.%, and CStigm\u00a0=\u00a026.35 wt\u00a0.\u00a0%\u00a0.

Gasification has been investigated using a laboratory scale continuous plant comprising a continuous down flow reactor with a volume of 200\u00a0cm3, a heat recovery section and pre-heat of the biomass to simulate more closely an industrial design. Feed streams (pure water and glucose solution) are introduced at the top of the vessel and products are extracted from the bottom. The reactor is equipped with various inlet points that allow to modify the inlet position of reacting streams in order to study the effect of stream mixing on reaction performance. Moreover, in order to obtain a description of the fluid flow inside the reactor, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out. The simulations were conducted by the ANSYS CFX 15 code which uses a finite volume method. Simulation allowed not only to understand the complex fluid dynamics that describes the system, but also to optimize the reactor configuration in order to attain good process performance.Experimental results coupled with CFD analysis, allowed to find that the reactor has the top section that behaves like a mixed reactor and the bottom section that behaves like a plug flow reactor. The two jet streams (water and glucose solution) entering the reactor cause back mixing in the top-side of the reactor, so contributing to rapid initiation of reaction and down-flow of species through the chamber. Using the best reactor configuration in term of mixing and temperature distribution allowed to maximize the gasification efficiency and H2 yield up to 72% and 74% by mole, respectively.",

For this, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) along with standard sterilization methods such as ultraviolet (UV), heat (autoclaving), ethylene oxide (EtO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were applied. The treated microchips were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Laser Scanning Microscopy in order to ascertain any changes in the chemical structure and surface morphology. The optimum sterilization parameters for SC-CO2 were elicited as 120\u00a0bar, 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 60\u00a0min which provided complete sterility and did not alter the main properties of the polymer along with EtO and H2O2 sterilizations unlike heat and UV treatments.

     "abstract": "Ammonothermal growth of nitrides occurs at temperatures in excess of 800\u00a0K and pressures greater than 150\u00a0MPa. For this region, no experimentally verified equation of state (EOS) exists for ammonia, nor is there any accurate description available for the equilibrium constant of the ammonia decomposition reaction for pressures in excess of 100\u00a0MPa. To fill this void, experimental P-v-T data was collected for pure ammonia at T\u00a0>\u00a0700\u00a0K and compared to extrapolated data from the reference EOS for ammonia. For the extrapolated region, the reference EOS provided excellent agreement to within error of the collected experimental data. A simplified EOS based on the Beattie\u2013Bridgeman (BB) EOS was derived and fit to calculated and, for ammonia, extrapolated reference EOS data for ammonia, hydrogen, and nitrogen (T\u00a0<\u00a01000\u00a0K, P\u00a0<\u00a0300\u00a0MPa). By applying mixing rules with separated contributions for polar and non-polar interactions, an EOS was derived for NH3\u2013N2\u2013H2 mixtures. With these expressions, an accurate description for the equilibrium constant for the ammonia decomposition reaction as a function of pressure and temperature was derived and verified against experimental data determined for total system pressures of 92, 151 and 210\u00a0MPa at T \u223c810\u00a0K. Coupling of the EOSs with the equilibrium constant permitted accurate modeling of a sealed autoclave filled with pure ammonia, after incorporating corrections for the expansion of the internal free volume due to thermal expansion and elastic strain response of the autoclave walls due to internal pressure buildup. Calculated total system pressure and equilibrium ammonia density at various temperatures and initial ammonia fill densities are in very good to excellent agreement with experimental data. This paper thus provides a simple EOS for ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen and NH3\u2013N2\u2013H2 mixtures accurate to within approximately 1\u20132% in pressure for temperatures greater than 700\u00a0K. The equilibrium constant for the ammonia decomposition reaction includes non-ideal mixing contributions from the second virial coefficient with a resulting accuracy in the equilibrium mole fraction of ammonia of approximately 2% for T\u00a0<\u00a0850\u00a0K.",

The mean solubility values ranged from 0.13 to 1.57\u00a0g \u03b3-oryzanol/kg CO2, and a crossover pressure (CP) was observed at 300\u00a0bar. Below of the crossover pressure, the solubility decreased with increasing temperature and above, there is solubility increase with increasing temperature. Although Chrastil equation parameters have been correlated to experimental data, a high mean deviation of 9.0% was observed because it is a mixture of compounds. The presence of oil lowers the solubility of \u03b3-oryzanol, which is the case of extraction from bran oil, showing that the nutraceutical is more concentrated at the final oil fraction or in the raffinate fractions.",

On the basis of the generalized form of a cubic equation of state, a mathematical framework for applying volume translations is provided, allowing for an unified and thermodynamically consistent formulation in the context of computational fluid dynamics simulations. This generalized methodology is applied to two selected volume translation methods that were recently proposed: the method of Abudour et al. (Fluid Phase Equilibria, 2012) and the method of Baled et al. (Fluid Phase Equilibria, 2012). In particular, the consistent integration of both methods in the evaluation of the caloric properties is investigated, showing that for Abudour et al.'s method one has to apply numerical integration whereas an analytical solution exists for Baled et al.'s method. The results of both volume translations are compared with those of the untranslated equations of state as well as with reference data. The density predictions of Abudour et al.'s method proved to be superior to those of the other approaches, whereas we observe a decreased accuracy for caloric properties. To evaluate the applicability of both methods in the context of real-gas computational fluid dynamics simulations, we performed well-resolved large-eddy simulations for the coaxial injection of cryogenic and gaseous nitrogen into a supercritical nitrogen atmosphere. A qualitative comparison of the numerical results with the available experimental backlight image shows a good agreement and a comparison of different volume translation methods demonstrates the effect of the thermodynamic model on the flow field.",

     "abstract": "The application of three supercritical processes to the micronization of gastroresistant insulin formulations is presented. As pharmaceutical applications of the supercritical anti-solvent micronization processes are becoming established at the bench scale, it is timely that they are compared in terms of product characteristics and scalability aspects. The formulation of insulin with the gastroresistant coating hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate was conducted by the Gas Anti-Solvent (GAS), the Aerosol Solvent Extraction System (ASES) and the Atomized Rapid Injection for Solvent Extraction (ARISE) processes and results have been compared in terms of insulin content of the microparticles, product morphology and recovery. The insulin content in products was in the range of 9\u201347%. The particles produced by the GAS process were flake-like in the 1\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm range with bi-modal distribution, while particles produced by the ASES and ARISE processes were spherical in the 100\u2013300\u00a0nm particle size range with unimodal size distribution. Compared to GAS and ASES, the ARISE process produced the highest recoveries and insulin loadings: 77% and 47%, respectively. Particle characteristics, process recoveries and operational aspects indicate that ARISE should be the process of choice for scale-up.",

     "abstract": "Tetracycline has been obtained as amorphous agglomerates in the supercritical antisolvent process. This phenomenon has been postulated to occur due to weak solvent/antisolvent interaction. In order to verify the hypothesis and prevent the coalescence of nanoparticles, we micronized tetracycline hydrochloride using supercritical and liquid CO2 in the precipitation with compressed fluid antisolvent process (PCA). PCA experiments were performed by varying temperature, pressure and initial concentration of the solution. SEM and BET were used to understand the coalescence behavior. Mean surface area (SBET) of the precipitates from liquid conditions was 58.91\u00a0m2/g, which was approximately two times higher than the mean surface area of the precipitates from supercritical conditions (SBET\u00a0=\u00a029.98\u00a0m2/g). Hansen distance (R), an indicator of solvent/antisolvent interaction, was used to understand the macroscopic phase behavior and solvent/antisolvent interactions. The result implied that both surface diffusion of the precipitates and solvent/antisolvent interactions affected the coalescence behavior. As a result, we successfully formulated tetracycline nanoparticles without extensive coalescence using liquid CO2 as an antisolvent.",

Different characterization methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to identify the initial graphite and exfoliated samples. Characterization results revealed the successful exfoliation of graphite into single to few-layer graphene. The effects of main process parameters including temperature (325\u2013425\u00a0\u00b0C), pressure (20\u201340\u00a0MPa) and mass percent of water as a co-solvent (0\u201350%) on the exfoliation yield were examined by using response surface methodology (RSM) in an experimental design.

In addition, results manifest the critical role of supercritical density in the graphite exfoliation. Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) of supercritical fluid were calculated to investigate the exfoliation of graphite in terms of supercritical density. Results indicated that modification of HSPs of supercritical fluid by tuning the supercritical condition is an effective way of improving the exfoliation yield.",

     "abstract": "Recently a new supercritical assisted process was proposed in the literature for the production of liposomes, called Supercritical Assisted Liposome formation (SuperLip) process. It has been demonstrated that, using this new process, it is possible to produce liposomes based on phosphatidylcholine (PC) with a controlled particle size distribution. Also a preliminary encapsulation test revealed a high encapsulation efficiency of bovine serum albumin (BSA), used as model hydrophilic compound.Being convinced of the great potential of the SuperLip process, in this work it has been studied the possibility of producing liposomes with a different composition of the bilayer membrane using the SuperLip process. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were used in a mixture and the production of liposomes was tested under different operative conditions: pressure, temperature and lipid composition. Results obtained using only PC and PC/PG mixture have been systematically compared. Furthermore a deepened study about the possibility to encapsulate BSA as model compound was performed. SuperLip experiments using different amount of BSA dissolved in the water internal phase were performed and the relative encapsulation efficiencies of produced liposomes were estimated. A comparison of encapsulation efficiency of liposomes produced, at the same BSA loadings, using a conventional preparation process (Bangham method) was also performed. The stability of entrapped protein was investigated.Sub-micrometric liposomes of soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC) of different size and distribution ranging between 250\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058\u00a0nm and 330\u00a0\u00b1\u00a082\u00a0nm were successfully produced. When using PG coupled with PC, larger liposomes were produced, ranging between 280\u00a0\u00b1\u00a070\u00a0nm and 350\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0101\u00a0nm. Both PC and PC/PG liposomes were stable over one month, thanks to the large and negative surface charge (zeta potential ranging between \u221220\u00a0mV and \u221230\u00a0mV).For the drug encapsulation tests different BSA theoretical loadings with respect to the lipid amount (10\u201330\u201360%, w/w) were tested. In the case of SuperLip process, very high encapsulation efficiencies (92\u201398%) were obtained at all the drug loadings; lower encapsulation efficiencies were instead obtained using the Bangham method (2\u201357%). Results reported in this work demonstrated that using SuperLip process, the protein contained in the water phase can be efficiently entrapped without damaging the protein structure as confirmed by FTIR analysis of processed BSA.",

Modified starches were choose as function of its low cost. The advantage of this method over conventional encapsulation that use modified starch via spray drier refers to the low temperatures used and absence of water in the process. Modified starch presents hydrophobic elements and this molecules present amphiphilic character. Usually it is employed in the encapsulation of essences as wall material with excellent volatiles retention due to its polar and nonpolar interface. Considering its hydrophobic characteristics, interactions between the modified starch and supercritical CO2 occurred, resulting in two different structural interactions of the limonene and modified starch in the PGSS (50\u00a0\u00b0C and 60\u00a0\u00b0C at 100\u00a0bar and 120\u00a0bar). When hydrous ethanol was used in the suspension, impregnation occurred and, when anhydrous ethanol was used, encapsulation occurred. Analysis of particle morphology via scanning electron and confocal microscopy, thermo-oxidative characterization by differential scanning calorimetry and determination of microencapsulated limonene via gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry indicated limonene microencapsulation and impregnation occurred despite the highly solubility of limonene in supercritical CO2. The retention of limonene by Purity Gum Ultra\u00ae was 86% when encapsulated and, 53% when impregnated, similar values to those obtained in conventional microencapsulation methods via a spray drier or via PGSS-drying.",

The influence of the temperature and pressure dynamics of the flow which is developed in such processes has not been satisfactorily studied. All physical properties can be strongly influenced by these parameters, and the quantification of changes and their impact on the process yield have rarely been studied using a CFD tools. Therefore, a thermodynamic model was proposed considering supercritical conditions of flow coupled to a fluid dynamic model for carbon dioxide and dichloromethane mixing in order to predict the thermodynamic properties and their influence on particle precipitation. These calculations include the density, thermal conductivity, viscosity and diffusivity, determined through Peng\u2013Robinson's EOS, the quadratic mixing rule of Van der Waals and the Riazi & Whitson and Chung methods, respectively. The simulations were performed using a commercial CFD code for pressures between 80 and 160\u00a0bar and temperatures between 308.15 and 318.15\u00a0K. Due to the mixture being near the critical point, small changes in temperature and pressure lead to important variations in the thermodynamic properties, directly influencing the dynamic mixing process which is related to the size, size distribution and morphology of the particles.",

The proposed mechanism based on the analytical evidence suggests that a complete dissolution of precursors facilitated the structural re-arrangement of atoms within the planes and lead to a significantly higher degree of crystallinity. Moreover, once the particles with (4\u00a02\u00a00) planes had formed, they were no longer involved in facile coalescence along their preferential planes due to their lower interfacial energy compared to the (2\u00a01\u00a01) planes. This led to control of the particle morphology and with little agglomeration occurring in the final nanopowder.",

Secondary and tertiary oil recovery, gas condensate recovery, especially by gas injection, near-critical fluids recovery and wettability alteration surface tensions are very important to measure. One objective of this study is to perform a precise measuring procedure employing the pendant drop technique. Iranian oil reservoir samples as denser phase and its immiscible injecting gas are used at reservoir condition. While experimental measurements are often expensive and time-consuming, models are commonly used. Moreover, this study presents the potential of the least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) modeling approach to predict the gas\u2013oil interfacial tension.

Hence, it is of practical importance to develop an accurate and reliable model for determining the CO2\u2013brine IFT. This paper presents the use of feed forward artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately estimate CO2\u2013brine IFT based on a database acquired from previous literature. The database consists of a total of 1716 CO2\u2013brine IFT datasets that cover relatively large ranges of pressure (0.1\u201360.05\u00a0MPa), temperature (5.25\u2013175\u00a0\u00b0C), total salinity (0\u20135\u00a0mol\u00a0kg\u22121) and mole fractions (0\u201380%) of impure components. Six independent variables were considered to develop the IFT estimation model: pressure, temperature, monovalent cation (Na+ and K+) molality, bivalent cation (Ca2+ and Mg2+) molality in brine, and mole fractions of N2 and CH4 in injected CO2 streams. The ANN topology was optimized by trial-and-error in order to enhance its capability of generalization and the optimal one was determined to be 6-10-20-1 (10 and 20 neurons in the first and second hidden layers, respectively). The accuracy of the proposed ANN model was highlighted by four evaluation matrices, namely mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute relative error (MARE), mean squared error (MSE), and determination coefficient (R2) between the measured and estimated IFT. The ANN model was further compared against four empirical IFT correlations developed in previous studies. It was observed that the ANN model outperforms significantly the empirical correlations and provides the most accurate IFT reproduction with respect to pure CO2\u2013pure water, pure CO2\u2013brine and impure CO2 systems.",

Moderately high pressures (13\u201317\u00a0MPa) and 10% of HA were proven to be favorable for creation of the PCL scaffolds with satisfying foam microstructure (mean pore size \u223c200\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm), filler distribution and thymol impregnation yields (12\u201318%). This was due to the satisfactory high scCO2 solubility (0.25\u20130.30\u00a0g/g) and mass transfer rate (\u223c10\u221210\u00a0m2/s) in the polymer phase as well as its great plasticizing effect (\u2212\u0394Tm\u00a0=\u00a026.4\u201327.4\u00a0\u00b0C). Higher saturation of the polymer phase with scCO2 (0.30\u20130.55\u00a0g/g), filler amount (20%) and thymol solubility in scCO2 (>5.5\u00a0g/kg) at pressures above 20\u00a0MPa resulted in decreased mass transfer rate and SSI efficiency.",

     "abstract": "The extraction process and mechanism of kerogen moieties with supercritical CO2 are elucidated using molecular dynamics simulations. It is demonstrated that supercritical CO2 can effectively dissolve the kerogen moieties adsorbed onto the shale surface, and the kerogen moieties dissolved in supercritical CO2 can be easily extracted from oil shale, because the interaction between the kerogen moieties dissolved in supercritical CO2 and the shale surface is greatly reduced. The dissolving capacity of supercritical CO2 is found to effectively increase with increasing pressure before the pressure reaches a critical value (approximately 50\u00a0MPa) and then increases slowly. Moreover, the dissolving capacity of supercritical CO2 increases with increasing temperature at high pressure, which is consistent with experimental results. In addition, the hydroxyl functional groups modified on the shale surface promote the extraction of kerogen moieties with supercritical CO2, and the polar kerogen moieties were more easily dissolved in supercritical CO2.",

The overall caffeine recovery from plant matrix was determined for all experiments at the same extraction conditions (30\u00a0MPa and 343\u00a0K). Additionally, the overall extraction curves of the static experiments were determined at the same process conditions, and the mass transfer model of Sovov\u00e1 was utilized to adjust the kinetic data and to determine the mass transfer coefficients.The highest caffeine yield was obtained with ethyl lactate in both static and dynamic extractions (13.0 and 14.2\u00a0mg/g of tea, respectively), followed by ethanol (10.8\u00a0mg/g with the static method and 8.8\u00a0mg/g with the dynamic method).

Covalent immobilization of horseradish peroxidise (HRP) on surface-modified mesoporous activated carbon (SMAC) in combination with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) has been investigated in this study. The supercritical medium achieved higher enzyme loading of 83.5% within 3\u00a0h compared to 54% when incubated in aqueous phosphate buffer for 30\u00a0h. HRP loading in the scCO2 environment was consistently higher for different HRP: SMAC ratios. The significant increase in the rate and quantity of HRP immobilization is attributed to the favourable transport properties of solutes in scCO2 coupled with greater affinity of HRP for the non-polar supercritical solvent which enhances the diffusivity of enzymes into the porous matrix. Immobilized HRP retained enzymatic activity after being reutilized 11 times which indicated that immobilization did not detract from HRP's activity. The immobilized HRP was successfully employed in removing phenol from water via polymerization of dissolved phenol in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The study shows the advantage of using a mesoporous substrate as the immobilization platform for enzymes in combination with scCO2 as the transport medium. It resulted in significant enhancement in the capacity as well as the uptake rate of HRP and resulting in the enhanced phenol removal.",

The drug loading yield was found to be between 30 and 87 drug/lipid w/w%. The particles obtained from lipid mixtures with low DMSO feed were homogeneous in size. The formulation prepared with the highest DMSO feed yielded a bimodal particle size distribution with significant aggregation. Interestingly, the use of helium in the preparation of the lipid mixture was found to improve the biopharmaceutical properties of the SLP, namely drug loading and particle dimensional features.

     "abstract": "Commercially available synthetic resins are durable and inexpensive. However, it is difficult to immobilize proteins on most commercially available synthetic resin plates, such as polypropylene (PP), polyethylene, polyurethane, and polyvinyl chloride, because these plates are durable and inactive. In this study, we attempted to immobilize bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (LZM) on commercially available synthetic resin plates using supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO2). Immobilization was attained by incubating a solution containing synthetic resin plates and proteins under ScCO2. BSA and LZM were successfully immobilized using this method; however, the amount of immobilized protein varied depending on the kind of protein and synthetic resin plate used as well as immobilization condition. The maximum amount of BSA immobilized on PP was 102\u00a0\u03bcg/g-resin. Although BSA conformation did not change after 24-h incubation under ScCO2 at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 8\u00a0MPa, it efficiently immobilized on PP plates. The protein immobilization mechanism by ScCO2 could be speculated that synthetic resin plates were swollen and proteins were diffused into synthetic resin. Then, proteins could be entrapped when synthetic resins were deflated by decompression. Our results suggest that use of ScCO2 may lead to new and improved methods for protein immobilization and surface modification of synthetic resins.",

In this work, the effect of pressurized carbon dioxide on the melting point depression of some ionic liquids able to dissolve biopolymers was experimentally determined using the first melting point method. Five different ionic liquids were studied in contact with CO2 using a high-pressure visual cell, up to a pressure of 10\u00a0MPa.

The radial distribution functions, spatial distribution functions, and coordination numbers derived from the simulations were further employed to understand how molecular structure specificities affect D12. The simulations proved that the molecular structuring of the solvent around the solute is similar for all ketones, which implies their diffusivities are essentially affected by their size and volume and, to a less extent, by the position of the carbonyl group in the carbon chain.

In this study, three different membranes were evaluated in terms of their fractionation capability and retention of patchouli oil in supercritical media, aiming at the separation and concentration of the main oil components (patchoulol and \u03b1-bulnesene) and regeneration of CO2. The membranes tested showed good resistance under the experimental conditions used, but did not show good fractionation and concentration of the patchouli oil components. The reverse osmosis membrane gave the highest oil retention (0.95) and lowest reduction in the permeate flux of the CO2 in the presence of the essential oil.",

     "abstract": "Miniaturization offers a possibility to increase the performance and decrease the time scales of systems. Existing microsystems using supercritical CO2 mainly utilizes multiphase segmented flows. To allow for a broader toolbox for future systems, also parallel flows are useful which eases the separation of the different phases. Here, the effect of different surface coatings are studied for multiphase flows of scCO2 and H2O in flat microchannels, with and without a 4\u00a0\u03bcm high ridge guide, which allows for pinning of the fluid interface inside the 190\u00a0\u03bcm wide and 35\u00a0\u03bcm high channel. Three different surfaces with different wettings toward scCO2 and H2O are studied, where a surface terminated with a hydrocarbon-based silane was observed to be neutral in the H2O/scCO2 system, a surface terminated with a fluorocarbon-based silane was hydrophobic, and an uncoated glass surface was hydrophilic.Using two flow rates of 5:5\u00a0\u03bcl/min (CO2:H2O) and 6.5:3.5\u00a0\u03bcl/min (CO2:H2O), a parallel flow between scCO2 and H2O was observed for uncoated and flat channels where the H2O flow pushed the CO2 to the side, before the flows eventually breaks up into segments. With a ridge guide in the middle of the channel, the interface was pinned at half the channel width, although still breaking up into segments. The neutral hydrocarbon-based surface coating with approximately 90\u00b0 contact angles resulted in evenly created segments without a ridge guide. Including a guide in the middle of the channel, a parallel flow was observed throughout the channel, although occasionally small CO2 segments entered the H2O outlet. Using the fluorocarbon-based silane resulted in an unstable segmented system with pressure fluctuations.Using surface modifications, an increased control can be achieved for either segmentation or parallel flow where a neutral surface is favored for a stable flow behavior. Together with a ridge guide, the fluid interface was pinned at the center.",

The structure of the copolyesters was confirmed with 1H and 13C NMR, FTIR spectroscopies and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The phase behavior of the polymers in supercritical carbon dioxide was explored as a function of concentration and temperature. It was shown that polymers containing 5% (in respect to bis-MPA) of chain extending units of the moderate length (5-hydroxypentanoate or 6-hydroxyhexanoate) exhibited the lowest phase transition parameters in supercritical carbon dioxide.",

In addition, semi-clathrate hydrate dissociation data for the TBAB\u00a0+\u00a0water system at a pressure of 99.8\u00a0kPa and at various TBAB concentrations of 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.30\u00a0mass fractions were measured.

The results reveal that the TBAB aqueous solutions with concentrations of 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20\u00a0mass fractions show a drastic promotion effect on the krypton hydrate causing a shift of the P-T equilibrium line to lower pressures and higher temperatures.

The oil is produced by subcritical fluid extraction (SFE) while the purification of the associated sterols is accomplished by a patented technology based on distillation.Besides the expenses and investment associated to the SFE, the respective costs and investment for the preliminary drying of biomass and final separation of sterols from bulk oil were also taken into account.

Here, aqueous solutions of several metal nitrate salts including zinc(II), copper(II), manganese(II), cerium(III), magnesium(II), nickel(II), silver(I), and zirconium(IV) have been treated as the precursors for the metal oxide nanoparticle synthesis in a batchwise SCW reactor. The experiments were conducted at two temperatures with different reaction properties, near-critical condition (400\u00a0\u00b0C) in which water preserves its ionic properties relative to the second point with higher temperature (500\u00a0\u00b0C) that the mechanism of reaction inclines to the free radical mechanism due to the falling of dielectric constant (\u025b). Based on the results of X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), it was revealed that some nitrate, hydroxide, and especially hydoxynitrates complexes with ionic origins through their synthesis path, as the byproducts of metal oxide formation reaction, were formed at low temperatures. However, these complexes decomposed into the metal oxide nanoparticles at higher temperature. Complementary experiments on copper nitrate solution showed that temperature is a key parameter in the formation and decomposition of metal complexes in the SCW treatment of metal nitrate solutions used in this research work. Finally, a general mechanism describing the formation and conversion of metal complexes during the treatment of aforementioned metal nitrate solutions and, consequently, synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles was suggested.",

The first stage provides for a continuous supply of coal\u2013water slurry (CWS) into the reactor and discharging of the products with SCW into the demountable samplers. The CWS composition was as follows (weight portions): coal\u2014100, water\u2014125, and starch\u20142.25.

At the second stage of conversion, the SCW/O2 fluid was pumped through a layer of coal particles accumulated at the reactor bottom during the first stage. It was shown that as a result of heat emission during partial oxidation of coal residue, the autothermal conditions for conversion were realized. The yields of volatile combustible and liquid products at conversion in the SCW/O2 fluid were 25.1 and 3.4\u00a0wt.%, respectively. The increment of hydrogen in the conversion products caused by water decomposition was equal to 20% relative to the weight of hydrogen in initial coal.",

Hydrogen and syngas formation was observed and quantified under the current conditions without significant formation of coke in the reactor. Residual hexadecane was also analysed for its contents of cracking products using GCMS. Investigating the temperature and residence time effects enabled determining the reaction kinetic data from which the activation energy, Ea, was determined to 263\u00a0kJ/mol (at 220\u00a0bar) and 202\u00a0kJ/mol (at 150\u00a0bar). The determined kinetic data were compared with previously reported results on high pressure pyrolysis of hexadecane and other hydrocarbons. The effects of increasing the water density by increasing the reactor pressure to (220\u00a0bar) was found in particular to enhance heat and mass transfer leading to a higher degree of conversion at lower temperatures, and increasing the ratio of n-alkane to 1-alkenes via in situ hydrogenation. Cracking was found to follow the free radical mechanism under both sub and supercritical conditions, producing nearly equi-molar distribution of n-alkanes and 1-alkenes, C7\u2013C13, under lower conversions. Increasing the reaction temperature enhances the formation of 1-alkene via \u03b2-scission, while increasing the pressure increases the formation n-alkanes via H-abstraction. In addition, it is found that the hydrothermal conditions have inhibited the formation of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, C16+, via addition reactions.

The technique involves mixing a second component (biopolymers or filler materials) in sodium alginate solution and crosslinking with carbonates of metals like calcium, strontium, cobalt, nickel, zinc and copper. Various biopolymers (lignin, starch, pectin, carrageenan, methyl and carboxymethyl cellulose, gellan gum, and gelatin), polymers (PVA, PEG, Pluronic P-123), inorganic (sodium silicate) and filler materials (titania and hydrophobic silica) were used as the second component. It is suggested to use pressurized carbon dioxide (5\u00a0MPa) for gelation and supercritical CO2 drying (10\u201312\u00a0MPa) to yield aerogels. Obtained aerogels are ultra-porous with low density (as low as 0.017\u00a0g/cm3), high specific surface area (200\u2013800\u00a0m2/g) and pore volume (2.3\u20139.5\u00a0cm3/g for pore sizes\u00a0<\u00a0150\u00a0nm). Basic examples expressing the applicability of these aerogels are demonstrated such as in the field of thermal insulation (thermal conductivity in the range 18.5\u201321.6\u00a0mW/m\u00a0K). Extension of carbon dioxide gelation technique from metal-crosslinked alginate-based system to other biopolymers (cellulose and chitosan) is also demonstrated.",

     "abstract": "The loading of a model drug, paracetamol (PC), via diffusion from an ethanol solution to the pores of the silica alcogel was studied. Partial differential equation representing the mass transfer within the cylindrical silica alcogel phase was developed and solved using the finite difference method. The model enabled the prediction of the time needed for maximum amount of loading and also the distribution of the drug inside the matrix at specific time points. It was observed that the concentration in the regions closer to the surface increased rapidly contrary to concentration in the regions close to the center which increased more slowly. The uptake of paracetamol was also measured gravimetrically and these experimental data were found to be in good agreement with the model predictions without any adjustable parameters. The effects of the tortuosity of the aerogels were also investigated by simulations. It was found that the duration for the maximum amount of loading increased with increasing tortuosity values. Moreover, silica alcogels that were loaded with paracetamol were dried with supercritical CO2 which resulted in paracetamol loaded monolithic silica aerogels. Characterization of these paracetamol loaded silica aerogels showed that paracetamol had diffused through the center of the aerogel and it had a crystal structure.",

In that context, we have developed a sol\u2013gel-process towards resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogels that includes a precise pH-adjustment at an early stage of the polymerization. As a result, less brittle analogues of Pekala aerogels were obtained that resemble Pekala gels in many aspects (skeletal density, porosity, thermal properties). However, significant differences were found in terms of inner surface area and compressive modulus, which are smaller for lower pH-values. Since pH-adjustment leads to minimal gel shrinkage, this sol\u2013gel-process may be useful for the development of aerogel composites.",

On the contrary, elastic modulus is found to strongly correlate with the heat transport along the solid phase, irrespective of the sample series considered. The insensitivity of this correlation to micro-structural details can be explained with theoretical approaches that are used to describe the macroscopic properties of porous materials.

Aerogel surface areas were measured, by Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET), for densities ranging from 35\u00a0mg/cm3 to 200\u00a0mg/cm3. Chlorosilanes were chosen as the test adsorbates for this study, as they do not physisorb in multiple layers on the mesoporous silica surface. Trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was selected as the primary adsorbate because of its high vapor pressure at ambient conditions. Aerogel samples were exposed to TMCS vapors until saturation. Complete infiltration was verified by Raman spectroscopy of a cross-sectioned sample. The total amount of adsorbate at saturation was determined through the weight gain using a microbalance. The cumulative TMCS surface area at saturation, calculated from the footprint of the TMCS molecule and the total number of molecules derived from the weight gain, is significantly smaller than the intrinsic surface area measured by BET. This implies that chemisorption, and not physisorption, governs the saturation phenomenon. This hypothesis was verified with chlorosilanes with larger molecules \u2013 phenyldimethylchlorosilane and diphenylmethylchlorosilane. The gained weight per unit volume in the silica aerogels scaled as the molecular mass of the radicals, bonded to the silica network, and did not scale as the footprint area of the different chlorosilane molecules.

Compared to precipitation by standard air-drying methods, through which a limited number of polymer structures can be achieved, the use of scCO2 offers the opportunity to tune the solid-state morphology of the material, which may assume the form of continuous films, discrete precipitates and/or porous microparticles, possibly passing from one to other by adjusting the temperature, pressure and solution composition. The crystalline structure and surface texture of the samples are assessed by means of optical, electron and confocal microscopy.

Results showed that all three single parameters were significant on the yield of FAEE and that reactions of degummed soybean oil with ethanol led to esters yields up to 65%, in these experimental conditions. These values are inferior when compared to the ones obtained with refined soybean oil probably due to the presence of several impurities in degummed soy bean oil such as pigments, antioxidants and phospholipids.

The research is based on the modified shrinking-core (SC) model for the mass transfer inside particles and assumes the pseudo-steady solvent flow in the SFE vessel. It is rigorously proven that for any variable flow rate v(t) and overall particle-size distribution F, the corresponding locally-monodisperse stratified (LMS) packing \u03c70 maximizes the current amount of extracted solute, while the appropriate filtration policy extends the domain of efficient particle-size distributions. Sufficient conditions that guarantee a certain extraction degree at a fixed time are deduced and formulated in terms of F-distribution. Being of obvious practical significance for finely ground substrates, optimization is shown to be rather limited for relatively big particles (commonly used in laboratory experiments), and only longer extraction times, higher oil solubility and diffusion rates allow noticeable increase in the extraction yield in this case.",

Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (SFE) has been applied for obtaining extracts from several vegetable matrices, including turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), due to its valuable volatile oil. However, a techno-economic evaluation of turmeric oil and ar-turmerone extraction has not yet been performed. Therefore, the effects of temperature, pressure and process time on the extract yield, relative ar-turmerone yield and manufacturing cost were evaluated in this work. Turmeric rhizomes were ground, sieved and placed in contact with scCO2 flowing at 8.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0kg/min in a laboratory scale SFE unit. Major compounds in the extracts were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. The manufacturing cost (COM) of the extracts was estimated using a model cost developed in the simulator SuperPro Designer 8.5\u00ae. Using SFE led to high yields of extract and ar-turmerone. Fast extraction combined with relatively low solvent consumption were observed. Yields of 6.4% and 1.02% of extract and ar-turmerone, respectively, were obtained at 333\u00a0K and 25\u00a0MPa for a solvent mass to feed mass ratio of 1.31.

Experiments were carried out to determine the influence of pressure, temperature and flow rate on the extraction yield. The yield varied from 37 to 97% of the one for n-heptane. The energy consumption in both extraction plants allowed an analysis of the different components involved in the extraction process, namely pumping, heating and cooling. This energy consumption was analysed depending on the amount of CO2 used, so the calculations can be extrapolated to any supercritical fluid extraction process undertaken in those plants. In the particular case of the supercritical extraction of oil seed rape, the best conditions in our experimental range were achieved at 55\u00a0MPa and 35\u00a0\u00b0C, yielding 100.3\u00a0g of oil per kW\u00a0h.

Hydrothermal conversion of black liquor in a batch reactor is particularly interesting towards hydrogen production, as the carbon dioxide is highly solubilized in the basic aqueous media. Thus hydrogen with higher purity than other processes is obtained. Cerium oxide nanocatalyst (cubic CeO2) is used to improve the amount of hydrogen produced and to decrease the coke formation, based on the water splitting into active species. Experiments have been carried out at sub and supercritical conditions 350\u00a0\u00b0C or 450\u00a0\u00b0C, 25\u00a0MPa) in a batch reactor for 15\u00a0min or 60\u00a0min. CeO2 nanocatalyst improved the conversion of black liquor at sub and supercritical conditions as expected. The amount of carbonaceous solid recovered was decreased due to the catalytic effect. Recovered hydrogen was not significantly affected by the catalyst as it was involved in secondary reactions such as hydrogenation. Oxidations reactions, as well as O2 production, were also improved using catalyst and supercritical media. Supercritical water media combined with catalyst clearly affects the fragmentation of dissolved lignin compared to subcritical conditions. Then it was assumed that water splitting occurs and produces active hydrogen and oxygen species. Thus these actives species produced using catalyst are able to improve hydrogenation and oxidation reactions, as well as recombination into H2 and O2.",

As much as 25 wt% H2O2 can be impregnated at operating conditions of 25\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C and 1200 psig. Thermal gravimetric analysis shows that H2O2-loaded CA mats lose more than 60% of available H2O2 when quickly heated to 37\u00a0\u00b0C and held at this temperature for 60\u00a0min. However, in comparison, pure H2O2\u2013H2O (50:50 w/w) solution evaporates 100% within 15\u00a0min at this same temperature. Shelf-life studies show that H2O2-loaded CA mats lose \u223c50% and \u223c100% of available H2O2 in 30 days, when stored at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. H2O2 slowly diffuses and subsequently evaporates from the CA mat at a rate determined by the diffusion of H2O2 through the CA fibers. We envision applying a thin polymer coating to the CA mat to suppress diffusional losses of H2O2, thus leading to an increased product shelf-life. These mats should find use as bandages for the continuous delivery of O2 for advanced wound care. In vitro studies presented here demonstrate that the developed bandages produce O2 at a controlled rate for 24\u00a0h.",

By varying the process parameters, the properties of the produced powders can be adjusted with defined size (generally micron or nanometer sized particles), morphology and a narrow particle size distribution. There is currently a growing interest for the elaboration of controlled delivery systems. For this purpose, the SAS process can also be applied in order to co-precipitate molecules of interest with biocompatible and/or biodegradable polymers.An experimental study dealing with supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) precipitation has been carried out in order to micronize a biocompatible polymer, ethyl cellulose, widely used as a drug carrier in controlled delivery systems for oral administration. Supercritical carbon dioxide was used as anti-solvent for the polymer and ethyl acetate (EtAc), generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) as solvent. The influence of the variation of the main operating parameters upon the characteristics of the micronized polymer was evaluated. In particular, the temperature (308, 318 and 333\u00a0K), the polymer concentration (1, 3 and 4\u00a0wt%), the EtAc/CO2 molar ratio (5 and 8\u00a0mol%) and the capillary tube diameter (127 and 254\u00a0\u03bcm) while pressure was kept constant and equal to 10\u00a0MPa.

The results showed that SAS micronization of quercetin led to a reduction in the quercetin particle size and crystallinity without a change in the needle-like habit.

A series of three columns with an internal diameter of 19, 58 and 126\u00a0mm and with a height of 2, 4 and 8\u00a0m respectively were used for the different scales, meaning scaling factors from 9 to 44 between columns. The massic solvent-to-feed ratio was varied between 5.2 and 78.8. Experimental results at the different scales are analyzed and compared from the thermodynamic, mass transfer and column hydrodynamics points of view; and also using process simulation by equilibrium-stage models. In total, 42 successful experimental runs are taken into account, including 6 at a pilot scale unit and 2 at an industrial scale.",

     "abstract": "Nowadays, combination of innovative technologies aiming to obtain additive or synergistic effects on microbial inactivation of food products compared to the single processes is considered a field of great interest. In this context, the feasibility of a combined high pressure carbon dioxide and high power ultrasound (HPCD\u00a0+\u00a0HPU) treatment was tested for the pasteurization of fresh cut carrot.Inactivation kinetics of the natural microbial flora (mesophilic microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria, total coliforms and yeasts and molds) were determined at 12\u00a0MPa and 10\u00a0W delivered every 2\u00a0min of treatment as a function of temperature (22, 35 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C) and time (from 5 up to 30\u00a0min). Further Escherichia coli was spiked on fresh cut carrot and inactivation kinetics were obtained at 6, 8, 10\u00a0MPa and 10\u00a0W delivered every 2\u00a0min of treatment as a function of temperature (22 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C) and times (from 3 up to 30\u00a0min). The results of the inactivation kinetics were compared with those obtained with thermal, HPU and HPCD treatments.Additionally color, pH, acidity, texture and sensory analyses of the samples were performed to assess the quality of HPCD\u00a0+\u00a0HPU treated carrots in comparison with the fresh product.It was demonstrated that the combined treatment was not able to induce a greater reduction of the natural microbial flora at milder process conditions compared to HPCD. At 40\u00a0\u00b0C, 12\u00a0MPa, 15\u00a0min and 10\u00a0W still a residual load of mesophilic microorganisms was detected. On the contrary, the inactivation kinetics of E. coli showed a faster reduction: 3\u00a0min at 10\u00a0MPa, 35\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u00a0W were enough to obtain 8\u00a0log reductions.Texture and sensory analyses revealed significant changes of HPCD\u00a0+\u00a0HPU treated samples with great reduction of firmness, friability and crispiness. The results showed the potentials and limits of the combined technology applied to fresh cut vegetables.",

To this end, a model of oscillatory motion of immersed cantilevers incorporating the effects of hydrodynamic forces was employed. Using argon as a reference fluid of known density and viscosity, cantilever calibration parameters were obtained from nonlinear regression of cantilever resonant frequencies and quality factors recorded in argon. Subsequently, these calibration parameters were used in the model equations to determine the density and viscosity of nitrogen at the given experimental pressure and temperature. In the studied pressure range, the root-mean-square deviations of the measured density and viscosity of nitrogen from the reference values obtained from NIST database were 2.5% and 5.2%, respectively.",

In comparison with classical set-ups, microfluidic devices exhibit higher heat transfer capability and small volumes, resulting in an easy control of temperature, fast conditions screening and improved operation safety. A set-up was designed based on the subtraction of two pressures: capillary and bypass lines. The devices use a capillary system with a diameter of 73.6\u00a0\u03bcm (\u00b10.5%). The proposed set-up can work in a wide range of pressures (10\u00a0<\u00a0P(bar)\u00a0<\u00a0200) and temperatures (30\u00a0<\u00a0T(\u00b0C)\u00a0<\u00a0227).

The solubility in scCO2 was dependent on the density of CO2. The addition of H2 to the scCO2 had negative impact on the solubility, and the solubility was proportional to density of CO2 with a constant mole fraction of H2. The equations proposed by Mendez-Santiago and Teja as well as Sauceau et al. were able to correlate the solubility in the pure CO2 and binary systems. This approach provides a framework to determine the precursor concentration for supercritical fluid deposition (SCFD) of Cu. The precursor feed system for optimal Cu-SCFD was discussed.

     "abstract": "The impregnation of active compounds in polymeric matrices using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is a well-known technique, which is currently used to formulate controlled drug release materials. In this study, supercritical impregnation of 2-nonanone in linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) was done in order to prepare active polymer films to be used in food packaging. Impregnation tests were carried out in a high-pressure cell, at 313\u00a0K with pressures ranging from 12 to 22\u00a0MPa and at two different depressurization rates: 1.0 and 10.0\u00a0MPa\u00a0min\u22121. This procedure allowed the preparation of films containing 2-nonanone at concentrations varying from 0.21 to 0.34 w/w%.Higher concentrations of 2-nonanone in LLDPE were obtained for impregnations done at lower pressures and the lowest depressurization rate. Release experiments showed that the depressurization rate of the impregnation process is a key parameter, which significantly affects the initial content of the active compound in the polymer. Simultaneously, a phenomenological mass transfer model has been used to describe the release of 2-nonanone from the polymer to a food simulant. This model was used to correlate the experimental release kinetic data, obtaining the values of diffusion coefficient of 2-nonanone in LLDPE, which were quantified between 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212 and 3.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212\u00a0m2\u00a0s\u22121 when depressurization rate was 10.0\u00a0MPa\u00a0min\u22121 and 6.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212\u00a0m2\u00a0s\u22121 when its value was 1.0\u00a0MPa\u00a0min\u22121.",

     "abstract": "The Cubic plus association (CPA) equation of state has been previously applied to a variety of binary systems containing CO2 with alkanes, water, alcohols and glycols as well as a few multicomponent mixtures (with triethylene glycol, water and methane). In this study, we evaluate the performance of CPA for ternary and multicomponent CO2 mixtures containing alcohols (methanol, ethanol or propanol) water and hydrocarbons. This work belongs to a series of studies aiming to arrive in a single \u201cengineering approach\u201d for applying CPA to acid gas mixtures, without introducing significant changes to the model. In this direction, CPA results were obtained using various approaches, i.e. different association schemes for pure CO2 (assuming that it is a non-associating compound, or that it is a self-associating fluid with two, three or four association sites) and different possibilities for modelling mixtures of CO2 with water and alcohols (only use of one interaction parameter kij or assuming cross-association interactions and obtaining the relevant parameters either via a combining rule or using an experimental value for the cross-association energy). It is concluded that CPA is a powerful model that can be used for predictions of multicomponent mixture properties using no adjustable parameters fitted to the multicomponent system data. The results are satisfactory and rather similar with most investigated approaches. However, an overall assessment, also based on the obtained results of this series of studies [Tsivintzelis et al. Fluid Phase Equilib. 306 (2011) 38\u201356, J. Chem. Eng. Data 59 (2014) 2955\u20132972, Fluid Phase Equilib. 397 (2015) 1\u201317], reveals that the best approaches are those where the cross-association (solvation) of CO2 with alcohols and water is explicitly accounted for or alternatively when CO2 is considered to be a self-associating molecule (with three or four sites). Furthermore, it is recommended to use the experimental values of the cross-association energy for CO2\u2013water and CO2\u2013alcohols.",

     "abstract": "Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) reactors can process waste effluents achieving high conversions, but the required extreme pressure and temperature operational conditions entail high-energy operational expenditure. SCWO has the potential to be considered a clean energy generation process, as the process effluent is a high temperature, high pressure stream with a high enthalpy content that can be converted to heat and shaft work. This ensures the self-sustained reaction and can generate excess shaft power to drive both the high-pressure pump and the air compressor. On the contrary, an efficient heat and power recovery from SCWO reactors outlet streams using conventional procedures presents several problems. First, Rankine cycles impose indirect heat transfer to the working fluid and are unable to recover the pressure energy and second, direct expansion of the effluents entails costly development of specific, efficient expansion equipment.In this work, we investigate the options for energy recovery of SCWO reactors coupled with commercial gas turbines (GT). SCWO outlet streams are mainly composed of water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. These operating values nearly resemble the well-known and already-implemented GT steam injection procedures. The temperature of the flue gases (approx. 500\u00a0\u00b0C) and the direct shaft work usage offers adequate energy integration possibilities for both feed preheating and compression. The wide range of commercially available GT sizes enables process scaling.",

A wafer is placed directly on the porous plate without a holding device, and the diameter of the porous plate is slightly larger than that of the wafer. This reactor has a minimal interior volume and realizes radial and unidirectional flow over the entire wafer. Furthermore, the in-plane pressure distribution is completely uniform, allowing a uniform flow distribution, which was verified by computational fluid dynamics simulations. Cu films were deposited on a 100\u00a0mm silica glass wafer using Cu(C9H12O2)2 (Cu(dibm)2) as a precursor. The average thicknesses were 75\u00a0nm at 185\u00a0\u00b0C and 182\u00a0nm at 200\u00a0\u00b0C,and the standard deviations were 19\u00a0nm and 14\u00a0nm, respectively. Basic film characterization was also performed.",

     "abstract": "Recently, we reported that 83% indium was recovered from CF glass and 10% from TFT glass of LCD panel wastes using sub-critical water at 360\u00a0\u00b0C. In the present work, in order to increase the recovery of indium in the form of indium tin oxide (ITO) and to reduce the reaction temperature, the effect of basic materials and their concentrations in sub-critical water on its recovery were tested. The basic materials were NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, diethyl amine, Ca(OH)2 and NH3. NaOH showed the largest recovery of indium from both CF and TFT glasses and reduced the reaction temperature. Treatment for only 5\u00a0min resulted in an outstanding indium recovery of 95% at 220\u00a0\u00b0C from TFT glass and 99% at 160\u00a0\u00b0C from CF glass. After the treatment, both TFT and CF glasses became transparent. ITO did not dissolve in the liquid-phase but remained in the solid organic multi-layers that were separated from the TFT and CF glasses by the sub-critical water reaction. These organic multi-layers were readily recovered by filtration. Since no indium dissolved in the liquid-phase, this recovery method is superior to others such as acid dissolution and ion-exchange. The optimum requirement of NaOH concentration and reaction time for indium recovery was 0.1\u00a0N and 5\u00a0min, respectively. The present result showed a significant improvement in indium recovery compared to our previous result without NaOH. Thus, sub-critical water in the presence of NaOH is highly feasible for the recovery of indium from TFT and CF glasses.",

Alkaloids were separated on a BEH 2EP column within 10\u00a0min, eluted by CO2-methanol as mobile phase with a back pressure of 13.8\u00a0Mpa and a column temperature of 45\u00a0\u00b0C.

The research intended to achieve two main objectives: (a) to restore the carbons adsorption performance and (b) to get insight about the p-nitrophenol oxidation process and how it can be influenced by the presence of the adsorbent.Based on the contaminant oxidation mechanisms, which was defined as a series of radical processes, a kinetic model was developed. The model was created by COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS software, and allowed obtaining characteristical parameters. Further comparison between theoretical and experimental results showed the suitability of the model in the whole range of experimental domain. Subsequent application of this model to regeneration experiments confirmed the need of developing a new model in the latter case, since the presence of carbon involved a significant modification of kinetic parameters, which was related to the catalyzing action of the adsorbent.It was also found that both temperature and pressure affect the p-nitrophenol degradation process as well as porosity regain of the carbons. Values of p-nitrophenol regeneration efficiency up to 87% for the highest values of temperature and oxygen partial pressure.",

     "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive enzyme-assisted supercritical fluid extraction (EASCFE) process developed to extract antioxidant phenolics from pomegranate peel (PP). Pomegranate peel collected from local agro-processing units was treated with various commercial and feed enzyme preparations. The morphological changes in the ultrastructure of PP cell wall after enzyme treatment were visualized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Extraction of antioxidant phenolics from enzyme pretreated PP was carried out by supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) with ethanol as a co-solvent. The extracts produced were investigated for their total phenolics (TP), antioxidant activity and phenolic acids profile using HPLC-DAD-ESI\u2013MS. The observed results showed that EASCFE doubled the recovery of crude extracts with increased level of phenolic constituents (TPs), and improved radical scavenging capacity (RSC), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation. HPLC-DAD-ESI\u2013MS characterization of the extracts authenticated the presence of vanillic (108.36\u00a0\u03bcg/g of extract), ferulic (75.19\u00a0\u03bcg/g of extract) and syringic (88.24\u00a0\u03bcg/g of extract) as potent phenolic acids. The results of this study support that EASCFE can be explored as a state-of-the-art green technological process for recovering optimum amounts of antioxidant phenolics from under-utilized pomegranate peel or other such materials. In addition, retention of appreciable level of naturally occurring vanillic, ferulic, and syringic acids in the enzyme-extracted components advocates that EASCFE is a good choice for preparation of PP extracts for food preservation as well as for the development of nutraceuticals and chemo-preventive phytomedicine.",

In this equation of state five pure-component parameters are required for each associating substance, two of which characterize the association interactions. Pure-component parameters for 23 self-associating and 6 non-associating substances are identified by correlating vapor pressure and liquid density data. A comparison of calculated values to literature data shows a good agreement for pure fluids. Binary systems with two self-associating compounds and others with one self-associating component and another non-self associating but can have cross-associating interactions with the first component are investigated. Binary parameters correcting the cross-dispersive interactions, kij, and the cross-associating interactions, \u03c5ij and \u03bbij, are fitted to the phase equilibrium data. In addition, when a simple non-self associating pure fluid is a part of a binary system and can have cross-associating interactions with the other component, its association fictive volume and energy are regressed simultaneously with the binary interaction parameters to the phase equilibrium data. The found results have shown that the PC-SAFT equation of state demonstrates high potential of correlation and prediction of vapor\u2013liquid, liquid\u2013liquid and vapor\u2013liquid\u2013liquid phase equilibria of 38 binary systems of associating fluids.

Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) is a desired green solvent for the extraction of omega-3 oils; however, there is no reported study on the SC-CO2 extraction of Camelina seed oil. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of SC-CO2 for the extraction of Camelina seed oil and to compare with traditional extraction methods. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite rotatable design was employed to investigate the extraction conditions: pressure (35\u201345\u00a0MPa), temperature (50\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C), and time (90\u2013250\u00a0min). A second order polynomial model was developed to predict the oil yield. Increasing pressure and time increased the oil yield, whereas increasing temperature did not have a significant effect. RSM-optimized conditions (45\u00a0MPa, 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 224.5\u00a0min) obtained by RSM for the range of variables predicted a yield of 27.0% oil, whereas the actual yield was 25.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0%. Oil yield was further increased to 31.6% at the RSM-optimized conditions by increasing the SC-CO2 extraction time to 510\u00a0min. Soxhlet (hexane) and cold press methods yielded 35.9% and 29.9% oil, respectively. Extraction method did not have a significant effect on the fatty acid composition and tocopherol content (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05); however, phytosterol content of the cold pressed oil was significantly lower than that of SC-CO2 and Soxhlet (hexane) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

     "abstract": "A procedure based on the application of pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) was employed to recover the major Amaranthus spp. flavonoid glycoside rutin from dried ground plant leaves. A central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize rutin extraction; three factors were considered: extraction solvent (water/ethanol ratio, from 0/100 to 100/0), extraction time (from 5 to 20\u00a0min) and extraction temperature (from 50 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C). Optimization of the three extraction parameters revealed that water/ethanol ratio in the solvent mixture was the most-significant factor influencing rutin yield, followed by extraction temperature. The total rutin recovery varied from 6.95 to 14.03\u00a0g/kg dry matter (DM) depending on the experimental conditions tested. The optimum extraction conditions for the highest rutin content were 70/30 (v/v) water/ethanol ratio, at 188\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00a0min as static extraction time. In this case rutin recovery from the leaves (14.30\u00a0g/kg DM) was 4-times higher compared to that attainable using conventional ultrasound assisted extraction (3.62\u00a0g/kg DM) with methanol:ethanol mixture (90:10) as solvent. Rutin recovery from defatted and non-defatted seeds of amaranth under optimum PLE conditions was 35.3 and 41.1\u00a0mg/kg DM, respectively, whereas using ultrasound assisted extraction 19.7 and 34.6\u00a0mg/kg DM were obtained, respectively.Extracts obtained under optimum conditions were further fractionated by using supercritical antisolvent fractionation (SAF). Extracts of amaranth leaves containing 70% water were mixed with supercritical CO2 and separated into two fractions according to the molecular mass and solubility of the contained compounds. A central composite experimental design was applied for the determination of the best fractionation conditions to maximize rutin enrichment. Maximum rutin concentration in raffinate (22.57\u00a0g/kg) was recovered at 15\u00a0MPa using a feed mixture flow rate of 0.3\u00a0mL/min.",

     "abstract": "The catalytic transesterification of crude Jatropha curcus oil (JCO) with supercritical methanol (scMeOH), in the presence of calcium lanthanum mixed oxide (CaLaO) heterogeneous base catalyst was carried out using a batch reactor at near critical temperatures and pressures. The performance of synthesized CaLaO mixed oxide catalysts was examined by characterizing it through instruments such as XRD, BET and CO2-TPD, revealed that the Ca/La atomic ratio strongly affects the phase structure, catalyst basic sites, and thus the catalytic reactivity. The reaction parameters including Ca/La atomic molar ratio in the mixed metal oxide catalyst, molar ratio of methanol to oil, catalyst concentration, reaction pressure, temperature and time were varied one at a time and optimized based on the content of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The highest FAME yield for supercritical methanolysis reached 93% under the optimum reaction conditions: 240\u00a0\u00b0C, 8.2\u00a0MPa, a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 21:1, and reaction time of 10\u00a0min in the presence of 1\u00a0wt.% catalyst. The results demonstrated that the presence of CaLaO mixed oxide catalyst in the reaction system effectively reduced reaction temperature, time and pressure of supercritical conditions. It required a very low concentration to mitigate the harsh operation conditions (290\u00a0\u00b0C, 15\u00a0MPa, 60\u00a0min) of the scMeOH process. On the other hand, supercritical reaction compensated for low conversion rate of solid catalytic transesterification whereby, it takes one step further by improving the role of catalyst with supercritical conditions to achieve higher yield and shorter processing time. The reusability of CaLaO mixed oxide catalyst for repeated use was tested, the catalytic activity was >80% when the catalyst was employed for fourth time. The study concluded that slight leaching of Ca2+ (0.52\u20136.07\u00a0ppm) and La3+ (0.34\u20132.33\u00a0ppm) occurred during transesterification reaction, however it is below acceptable levels of metals as ASTM D6751 (United State) and in Europe, EN 14214 (Europe) standards. This proved that heterogeneous catalytic supercritical reaction process is more promising than non-catalytic processes and it can be turned to practical use in the near future.",

This work presents a study of the encapsulation of quercetin in water-soluble carriers by antisolvent precipitation using three different techniques: shear mixing, continuous flow turbulent mixing at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature and turbulent mixing at high pressure and high temperature. A preliminary study of quercetin formulation by shear mixing showed that modified OSA-starch and Pluronic L-64 were not good carrier materials due to the low encapsulation efficiencies and high particle sizes obtained. However, using lecithin as carrier material, it was possible to obtain stable and homogeneous aqueous dispersions of quercetin particles with encapsulation efficiencies up to 90%.

The melting points of PEG 1500, PEG 4000, PEG 10\u00a0000 and PEG 35\u00a0000 were determined by a simple glass capillary method. Results show that solubility is a strong function of temperature, pressure and gas density as it increases with increasing pressure at a constant temperature. Maximal solubility in the investigated range of conditions is approx. 0.05\u00a0g argon/g polymer at 373\u00a0K and 34\u00a0MPa.

The attained polymer molecular weights were higher than those in previous reports using compressed fluids, even in the supercritical state, or individual ionic liquid media. The maximum attained Mn for linear PLLA in this work was 28,000\u00a0g/mol, and that for hyperbranched was 11,200\u00a0g/mol which were up to 3-fold higher than those obtained with the ionic liquid medium, and this is attributed to favored reaction media characteristics in this critical/miscible system. Additionally, non-enzymatic propagation side mechanisms were minimized or eliminated with the addition of the green compressed R134a.",

The PMMA-ZnO QD composites were dissolved into tetrahydrofuran and transparent polymeric hybrid films of ZnO nanoparticle QDs and PMMA were obtained after evaporation of the THF from the solution. The unmodified ZnO nanoparticle QDs, which were agglomerated in the PMMA matrix, and the well-dispersed silica-coated ZnO nanoparticle QDs coupled with TPM exhibited weak and high emissions, respectively under UV irradiation.

     "abstract": "The equilibrium partition of a vegetable extract between supercritical (SC) CO2 (fluid phase) and a vegetable substrate (solid phase) is commonly best-fitted in the mathematical simulation of extraction curves. The aim of this study was to develop and apply an experimental methodology to measure the equilibrium partition of rapeseed oil between SC CO2 and prepressed rapeseed. We measured and modelled sorption isotherm/isobar curves using a methodology that intersperses extraction (to reduce oil content) and equilibration (by recirculation of the SC CO2 phase) steps, with oil being sampled in each step. Oil desorption was a two-stage process; when rapeseed contains more than \u223c70\u201380\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121 oil/substrate the SC CO2 phase gets saturated with oil (Cf\u00a0=\u00a0Csat), whereas when it contains less oil this is bound to the solid matrix in such a way that Cf dips below Csat. Increasing pressure from 22 to 28\u00a0MPa at constant temperature (40\u00a0\u00b0C) increases Cf. The effect of the increase in pressure is less pronounced when SC CO2 density is kept constant (857.1\u00a0kg/m3) by simultaneously increasing temperature from 40 to 50\u00a0\u00b0C. The heat of desorption of the oil is \u223c100\u00a0kJ/mol which suggests it is bound to the prepressed seed by van der Waals interaction forces. However experimental values in this region are uncertain due to propagation of uncertainties to estimate Cs.",

The first model is the cubic Peng\u2013Robinson (PR) EoS using both the quadratic van der Waals mixing rules and the free energy model-based Wong\u2013Sandler mixing rules. The second model is the group contribution (GC) EoS from Skjold-J\u00f8rgensen, which combines the advantages of an EoS with those of an activity coefficient model using a group contribution approach. In both models the parameterization of the IL is very challenging. The main reason is the lack of experimental data on pure component vapor pressure and critical properties due to the negligible volatility and the decomposition of the molecule before reaching the critical point. This work analyzes the different alternatives available for calculating the pure component parameters of [hmim][TCB] of both PR EoS and GC EoS and discusses how the accuracy of the models changes with the number of fitted binary interaction parameters. The results of both EoS are compared and the suitability of both models for different applications is discussed.",

Both models were able to satisfactorily correlate the experimental vapor\u2013liquid equilibria (VLE) at low pressure as well as the liquid\u2013liquid equilibria (LLE) at high pressure (above the critical point) by fitting only one temperature-independent parameter. Moreover, excellent agreement with experimental data was found with both EoS when more than one parameter was fitted. The relative absolute average deviation (AARD) of PR EoS was 1.95% for the CH4\u00a0+\u00a0[hmim][TCB], 3.14% for C2H6\u00a0+\u00a0[hmim][TCB], and 5.51% for the C3H8\u00a0+\u00a0[hmim][TCB] systems.

Reduced temperature and pressure are the inputs of the model. 80% of the dataset was used for training the model and the remaining 20% was used to evaluate its accuracy and reliability. Statistical and graphical error analyses have been conducted to investigate the performance of the model and the obtained results from the proposed model have been compared with those of six equations of state, REFPROP package and two correlations. It was demonstrated that the proposed CSA\u2013LSSVM model is more efficient and reliable than all of the studied empirical correlations, equations of state and the software package, hence it can be utilized confidently for the prediction of carbon dioxide compressibility factor.",

This fruit has a lot of oil which can be used for nutritional and medicinal purposes. The aim of this research was to study the oil extraction process from pequi pulp, the quality of the extracts, kinetic modeling, and extraction with subcritical propane. Pequi fruits were extracted and their pulps were dried and ground. The oil extracted with subcritical propane was obtained at a pressure range of 5\u201315\u00a0MPa and temperatures of 303.15\u2013333.15\u00a0K. The highest yield was 43.69% for the extraction condition of 15\u00a0MPa and 333.15\u00a0K.

Soxhlet extractions were performed using ethanol and hexane as solvents and higher yield (52.78%) was obtained with the use of ethanol. The fatty acid analysis showed that different experimental conditions did not impact the fatty acid profile. The fatty acids found at greater proportion were palmitic acid (35.4%, in mass) and oleic acid (60.6%, in mass). The phenolic compound content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method and showed no significant difference among the extraction methods used.

     "abstract": "Combustion in liquid rocket engines happens under severe thermodynamical conditions: pressure exceeds the critical pressure of injected propellants and temperature is cryogenic. Such a situation requires an important effort of modeling: real gas effects are incorporated through cubic equations of state along with pressure-correction terms, and transport properties follow specific rules. Modeling for turbulent combustion is also an issue and is presently considered with tabulated chemistry thus reducing the number of transported variables. In this study, a framework is provided to deal with real-gas compressible reacting flows with tabulated thermochemistry. As a consequence, a cubic equation of state for tabulated thermochemistry is derived with the adopted thermodynamic relations, and the temperature computation is adapted to incorporate real gas effects through the tabulated thermochemistry approach. Two-dimensional reactive and non-reactive theoretical test cases have been performed with success to demonstrate the capacity of the new method. Finally, the simulation of a three-dimensional non-reactive single injector derived from Mayer's experiment, that consists of a supercritical nitrogen jet injection into a warm nitrogen atmosphere, is also performed with success. The comparison between the tabulated approach and a fully coupled reference solution leads to similar results for the density values along the jet axis and for the spreading rate.",

     "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted great interest from scientific and industrial communities thanks to their remarkable properties. However, even if their mass production is nowadays well-known, the methods commonly used lead to bundles made of hundreds of single nanotubes with inert surface. Through the description of a simple, rapid and green procedure to uniformly decorate CNTs with metal nanoparticles (Ag, Pd), this paper presents a look at the CNTs-metal interface as a function of the functionalization technique.Three types of CNTs are considered for deposition: raw CNTs, CNTs functionalized with the reference HNO3/H2SO4 method and CNTs functionalized with our approach using CO2/EtOH/H2O/H2O2 under temperature and pressure. For functionalized CNTs the Pd atoms and CNTs are linked by oxygen atoms and the coating is made of metallic palladium nanoparticles while palladium oxide nanoparticles are formed on raw CNTs, the functionalization having an influence on the nucleation and growth phenomenon. Furthermore the surface treatment of CNTs in acidic solution has a major drawback with CNTs contamination that is why a functionalization with CO2/EtOH/H2O/H2O2 under temperature and pressure is preferred. In addition, electron tomography has shown that the use of supercritical fluids leads to a uniform deposition of metal inside the bundles of CNTs. The orientation relationship between palladium nanoparticles and CNTs has also been determined; the {1\u00a01\u00a01} planes of palladium nanoparticles are parallel to the CNTs graphite planes.

The appearances of the external and internal surfaces, fibre size, external and internal mass loss, density, porosity, and fragmentation, etc. were measured and analysed. The results are explained by the different reactivity of the supercritical fluids compared with the steam and CO2 at atmospheric pressure. The results are coherent with a gasification model based on percolation theory, and special emphasis is given to fibre disintegration once the carbonaceous matrix porosity has reached a critical value.",

The resulting INS-PLLA PMs exhibited a rough and porous structure with a geometric mean diameter (Dg) of 15.62\u00a0\u03bcm, an aerodynamic diameter (Da) of 4.31\u00a0\u03bcm, a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 65.57% and good aerosolization characteristics. The physicochemical characterization reveals that no chemical changes occurred on INS-PLLA PMs, while minor structural changes existed in insulin. The result of circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy demonstrates a slight change happened in the secondary structure of insulin, however, the bioactivity verification test shows that the hypoglycemic activity of insulin from INS-PLLA PMs was well maintained, which shows no significant difference from the raw insulin. The fluorescent image of INS-PLLA PMs demonstrates that the insulin was homogeneously distributed in the matrix, and INS-PLLA PMs displayed a sustained-release effect. Furthermore, INS-PLLA PMs with almost no organic residue could promote the safety and suitability for pulmonary delivery of protein drugs. This study indicates that emulsion-combined PCA process is an effective and benign technology to produce INS-PLLA PMs, which have potential in the application of pulmonary drug delivery for treatment of diabetes.",

Using the power-law relationship to fit the experimental results, an explicit terminal velocity formula that considers the viscosity of SC-CO2 was obtained.

The higher amount of asphaltene transformation as well as suppression in coke formation over/in catalyst could be attributed to larger portion of cracking occurred mainly in catalyst surface and pore volume (PV), whereas the cracking based on pyrolysis was accomplished free-radically in bulk volume (BV). In catalytic reaction, a consecutive cyclic reaction is taking place as; oxidative cracking of asphaltene over catalyst (with converting Fe3+\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Fe2+) followed by in-situ hydrogenation of cracked fragments via in-situ hydrogen resulted from dissociation of water (with converting Fe2+\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Fe3+). Moreover, SC-H2O reforming of hydrocarbons (CmHn) and conversion of those containing oxygen-containing groups, e.g., ethers, esters, carboxyls, carbonyls, to CO as well as related water\u2013gas shift reaction (CO\u00a0+\u00a0H2O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0H2\u00a0+\u00a0CO2) would facilitate over catalyst by which higher amount of asphaltene conversion and maltene yield were attained.",

     "abstract": "Quercetin is a flavonoid with highly promising bioactivity against a variety of diseases, due to its strong antioxidant, antiviral and antihistaminic effect, but these applications are limited by the low solubility of quercetin in gastrointestinal fluids and the correspondingly low bioavailability. The objective of this work is to produce encapsulated quercetin particles in sub-micrometric scale, in order to increase their low bioavailability. These particles were produced by extraction of organic solvent from oil in water emulsions by supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions (SFEE). Due to the rapid extraction of organic solvent by this method, the disperse organic phase becomes rapidly supersaturated, causing the precipitation of quercetin particles in sub-micrometric scale, encapsulated by the surfactant material. Two different biopolymers (Pluronic L64\u00ae poloxamers and soy bean lecithin) were used as carriers and surfactant materials. In experiments with Pluronic, needle quercetin particles were obtained after SFEE treatment, with particle sizes around 1\u00a0\u03bcm and poor encapsulation efficiency. In case of soy lecithin, quercetin-loaded multivesicular liposomes were obtained, with a mean particle size around 100\u00a0nm and around 70% encapsulation efficiency of quercetin, without presence of segregated quercetin crystals.",

In this method, phospholipid suspension in water was equilibrated with high pressure CO2 and the CO2-expanded liquid phase was depressurized via two protocols. In protocol (I), depressurization rate was kept constant while in protocol (II), both the depressurization rate and the pressure inside the vessel were constant. Pressure, depressurization rate and temperature were the processing parameters evaluated in terms of their effect on the properties of the liposomes obtained. Particle size of liposomes prepared by the modified supercritical method was as small as 265\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0nm and 214\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0nm for protocols (I) and (II), respectively. Elevated pressure contributed to a smaller size while higher depressurization rates resulted in enhanced uniformity. Amount of unhydrated CO2 dissolved in the phospholipid bilayer seems to be important for a small particle size while release rate from between the bilayers may affect size distribution. Liposomes prepared by the modified supercritical method were stable for up to 8 and 6 weeks for protocols (I) and (II), respectively, with a high zeta potential. Protocol (II) yielded smaller and more uniform particles while protocol (I) gave higher storage stability. The modified supercritical method is more effective in liposome preparation than conventional thin film hydration method for a reduced size and enhanced stability.",

We used 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenyl ether and pyromellitic dianhydride of Kapton-type polyimide API monomers. Although the morphologies of the API films deposited on the outside surfaces of the trenches depended on the distance from the supply outlets of the monomers, the API thin films were deposited onto the surfaces of the walls of the trenches with an approximately equal thickness from the outer surface position to the bottom position regardless of the distance from the supply outlets. However, the film thickness on the walls of the trenches depended on the distance from the supply outlets, because the trenches near the supply outlets were likely to be blocked by the masses of APIs during deposition. The film deposited at 230\u00a0\u00b0C was much smoother than that deposited at either 150 or 200\u00a0\u00b0C, which could have been caused by the differences in imidization rates and the amounts of PAA entering into the trenches based on the differences in the deposition temperatures although the film thickness showed no significant temperature dependency in the experimental conditions. The film thickness increased with increases in deposition time on the walls of the trenches in positions where no masses of APIs were found on the outer surface.",

Preliminary experiments revealed the importance of a higher mixing speed and a longer static time on hydrocarbon yields. In a second set of experiments, when toluene was introduced as a modifier, a higher SC-CO2 density (i.e. high pressure, low temperature) led to higher extraction yields. In the absence of toluene, higher temperature conditions (i.e. lower SC-CO2 density) provided higher extraction yields\u2014suggesting desorption resistant hydrocarbon components in the oil sand matrix slurry are released as a result of increasing temperature.

Highest extraction yields were obtained by Soxhlet extraction and SFE on 300\u00a0bar and 40\u00a0\u00b0C (14.45% and 8.88%, respectively), while SWE on 100\u00a0\u00b0C provided lowest yield of lipid extract (0.36%). Concerning yields of five dominant compounds from coriander EO (\u03b3-terpinene, (+)-limonene, linalool, camphor and geraniol), highest yields of oxygenated monoterpenes (linalool, camphor and geraniol) were obtained by Soxhlet extraction (785.05, 26.73 and 21.96\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g of coriander seeds (CS), respectively), while \u03b3-terpinene and (+)-limonene extraction yields (31.08 and 23.98\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g CS, respectively) were highest by SFE on 300\u00a0bar and 40\u00a0\u00b0C. SFE on these conditions also provided particularly high yields of linalool, camphor and geraniol (598.51, 26.64 and 19.54\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g CS, respectively). Besides EO, SFE provided extraction of vegetal oil while, polyphenolics were also extracted by SWE, increasing health value of obtained extracts, and presenting good alternatives for traditional techniques for EO extraction, i.e. isolation.",

Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of LEH at 450\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C produced H2, CO2, CH4, CO, C2H4, and C2H6, and converted the organic-bound nitrogen in the LEH into ammonium in the aqueous phase.

The three accurate kinetic models allowed to describe the effect of reaction conditions mainly hitherto not studied CO2 pressure and reaction time on the concentration of intermediate compounds such as xylose and arabinose in both oligomer and monomer form as well as final compounds e.g. acetic acid, furfural and other degradation products.

     "abstract": "Recent publications in the open literature have shown that supercritical fluid states are not homogeneously distributed but, in fact, can be differentiated into two distinct regions with gas-like and liquid-like properties, respectively. These regions are divided by an extension of the coexistence line, commonly called Widom line. This paper shows that a supercritical analog to subcritical phase change, pseudoboiling, does exist when crossing this demarcation. The supercritical state transition does not occur in a phase equilibrium but takes place over a finite temperature interval. While subcritical vaporization requires energy to overcome intermolecular attraction, supercritical state transitions additionally require energy to increase the temperature. It could be shown that the attractive potential is the dominant energy sink up to a reduced pressure of 1.5 for argon, nitrogen, oxygen, and water. The effect reduces with growing pressure and becomes negligible for p/pcr\u00a0>\u00a03. Furthermore, a new equation for this Widom- or pseudoboiling-line is given. It exhibits improved accuracy over previously published equations; performing a limit analysis of the Clapeyron equation allows to express its sole parameter purely in terms of thermodynamic variables. This parameter can then be evaluated from an equation of state or from fluid data - no nonphysical fitting is required.",

ATRA showed to be effective in the treatment and/or chemoprevention of several epithelial and hematological malignancies and diverse dermatological and eye diseases however, its low solubility in aqueous media and photosensitivity hinder its wider usage by the conventional administration methods. Supercritical fluids technologies are being widely used to enhance the in vivo bioactivity of this type of drugs both by improving their dissolution rate (using particle size reduction processes) and/or by controlling their release into the media after incorporation into solid polymeric/inorganic matrices (using supercritical impregnation/foaming processes). In both cases the solubility of the drug in the supercritical fluid (usually scCO2) is required for process optimization purposes. Therefore, in this work the solubility of ATRA in scCO2 was measured at different isotherms (308.2, 318.2 and 328.2\u00a0K) and pressures that ranged from 10 up to 30\u00a0MPa using a static analytical method. Solubility data were correlated using three commonly used density-based models, namely the Bartle, Chrastil and M\u00e9ndez-Santiago\u2013Teja models. The solubility of ATRA in scCO2 was found to be between 1.52\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 and 1.84\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 in terms of ATRA mole fraction and between 7.50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 and 1.07\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22121 in terms of amount of solid solute per unit of volume of scCO2.

A systematic study of the influence of the shape (pellets or films) and the thickness of the materials shows that it is possible to increase the speed of extraction with a thinner material: high yields (100%) are obtained with films at 300\u00a0bar, 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 5\u00a0min of extraction. Finally, the potential of SCCO2 extraction was compared to that of traditional liquid extraction with methylene chloride.",

The dependency of the extraction kinetics on the variables more tested in the literature (pressure, temperature, particle size and solvent flow rate) was confirmed, and original trends were obtained for the less investigated variables, such as the bed porosity \u025b and the extractor diameter to length ratio (D/L). The extraction kinetics did not depend on \u025b for 0.23\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u025b\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.41, while a further decrease in \u025b lowered the extraction rate, likely due to the occurrence of channeling. The effect of a variable D/L ratio was studied letting constant the ratio of substrate mass to CO2 mass flow rate: the lower was D/L, the lower the specific CO2 consumption. Through modeling, the values of internal and external mass transfer parameters were calculated and critically discussed on the basis of well-known literature correlations.",

As for conventional ethanol or methanol/acetone/water extraction, nine phenolics were identified in SFE-extracts including the sugar-based phloridzin and quercetin derivatives. Extraction kinetics of the nine phenolics and of the global yield were monitored via collection of fractions that were also characterized for their antioxidant activity (ABTS antiradical activity). Kinetics showed a constant extraction rate up to 1.1\u00a0kg of fluid and a decreasing rate afterwards, but the matrix was not exhausted after 3\u00a0h of extraction. Besides the classical continuous flow protocol, SFE was performed by introducing static periods between the dynamic collect of fractions. Static periods did not yield significant improvement in the overall yield and in the individual yield of most phenolics. Increasing the matrix loading did not improve the recovery either.

     "abstract": "Very fast decompressions of extraction vessels reduce the temperature of their walls below the \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C limit when they become brittle. Therefore, decompression of large vessels operating at high pressure may set a lower limit to extraction time in industrial multi-vessel supercritical CO2 extraction plants (thus negatively influencing production cost), but this has rarely been studied. This work studied decompression of CO2 initially at 30\u00a0MPa in a 3.96\u00a0L vessel vented through a partially opened needle valve. Slow CO2 venting avoided a two-phase (liquid\u2013gas) mixture in the vessel. Pressure drop was fast at the beginning and end of decompressions, and comparatively slower within the 10\u201315\u00a0MPa interval, before CO2 crossed the pseudocritical line. Temperature dropped at the beginning of decompressions, remained comparatively constant in the intermediate period, and increased at the end. Decompression time was inversely proportional to valve opening, and was shorter when starting at 60 than 50\u00a0\u00b0C. The initial drop in temperature was proportional to valve opening, and similar for different starting temperatures. When the vessel was packed with pretreated (either pressed or pressed and pelletized) and extracted rosehip or raspberry seeds, depressurization time was proportional to the porosity of the packed bed and independent on other properties of the substrate. Being flow through the needle valve choked, venting rate was determined by its opening and the continuously changing physical properties of CO2 in the vessel. To estimate the changes in internal energy of the CO2 in the vessel that define vessel wall's temperature, the heat provided by the service fluid (in our case water circulated through the vessel jacket), the heat yield by the walls, lid, and bottom of the high-pressure vessel, and the heat yield by the substrate charge need to be incorporated to the transient heat balance model of the depressurization process. The experimental results obtained in this work can be used to validate a model of the depressurization process that could simulate decompressions of industrial vessels as a function of their size and shape, the extraction conditions, and the packed substrate. Predicted decompression times would therefore set restrictions to the setup times required to replace exhausted by fresh substrate in industrial vessels, in studies of minimization of production cost.",

For a safe and economical design, prediction of carbon dioxide solubility by a trustworthy model is really essential. In this research, based on the pressure and temperature of system and the critical properties such as critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) and also acentric factor (\u03c9) and molecular weight (Mw) of pure ionic liquids, a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) have been developed to estimate carbon dioxide solubility in presence of various ILs over wide ranges of pressure, temperature and concentration. To this end, 728 experimental data points collected from the literature have been used for implementation of these models. To verify the proposed models, regression analysis has been conducted on the experimental and predicted solubility of carbon dioxide in ILs. Moreover, in this study, a comparison between experimental carbon dioxide solubilities and predicted values of carbon dioxide solubility by thermodynamic models based on Peng\u2013Robinson (PR) and Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013Kwong (SRK) equation of states has been performed.

Seven flowsheet configurations have been simulated in Aspen Plus\u00ae.

The performance of the single module has been analyzed to determine suitable process variables, such as the magnitude of sweep gas flow. We identify three flowsheet configurations each having individual benefits: Configuration 1 is most simple but highly sensitive towards changing process parameters, configuration 2 is CO2-emission-free, and configuration 3 is most insensitive towards membrane selectivity. With configuration 3 a cost reduction of 20% compared to the benchmark zeolite adsorption is identified: also the process is continuous and free of cycling of gas streams.",

Notably, the incorporation of hydrocarbon CO2-philic tails with a high degree of branching has been found to significantly boost CO2-philicity, allowing the surfactant to stabilise water-in-CO2 (w/c) microemulsions at low cloud pressures, Ptrans. The newly synthesised hybrid CF2/SIS1 (sodium (4H, 4H, 5H, 5H, 5H-pentafluoropenyl-5,7,7-trimethyl-2-(1,3,3-trimethyl-buthyl)-octyl)-2-sulfosuccinate) is a CO2-philic surfactant that contains the lowest amount of fluorine (15.01 wt%) and exhibits the highest efficiency of any di-chain surfactant to date. High-pressure phase behaviour studies provided a maximum water-to-surfactant molar ratio (wmax) of wmax\u00a0=\u00a039, which is usually only observed from surfactants with long fluorocarbon chains. The present results are beneficial for expanding the pool of economical, effective, and efficient surfactants available for CO2-based technology.",

     "abstract": "The phenomenon of retrograde melting at constant temperature takes place when a solid phase is melted, or made to disappear, upon compression. Analogously, retrograde melting at constant pressure happens when a solid phase is melted, or made to disappear, upon cooling. In this work, we propose a test that makes possible to establish for a calculated, already converged, binary solid\u2013fluid equilibrium (SFE) point (of temperature TSFE, pressure PSFE, and fluid phase composition z2), whether the behavior is regular or retrograde and, in case of retrograde behavior, whether the melting phenomenon is retrograde with respect to temperature, or to pressure, or to both. The test is based on evaluating, at TSFE and PSFE, the derivatives of the reduced tangent plane distance (tpd) with respect to temperature ( d t p d * / d T | P , z 2 ) S F E and pressure ( d t p d * / d P | T , z 2 ) S F E , for a tested phase of composition z2, and a trial phase consisting of the pure heavy component in solid state at TSFE and PSFE. The distinguishing feature of the present test is that the derivatives ( d t p d * / d T | P , z 2 ) S F E and ( d t p d * / d P | T , z 2 ) S F E are evaluated explicitly from the already converged SFE point, i.e., the present test does not require the computation of additional SFE points. Consequently, the test is fast and can be used for all points of a calculated SFE segment of an isopleth envelope. This leads to the eventual identification of points along the computed SFE segment where transitions from retrograde to regular behavior occur. We present results for a couple of highly asymmetric systems with the help of a model that uses an equation of state for describing the fluid phases, and a standard equation for describing the fugacity of the pure heavy component as a function of temperature and pressure.",

In recent years, a few works have been carried out to investigate the solubility of some polar polymers in the supercritical carbon dioxide so that most of them have focused on the synthesis method of the polymers and measurements of their cloud point pressure. However, there is a lack of a proper thermodynamic model for prediction of the solution cloud point pressure of such systems. In this work, we model the cloud point pressure of the various types of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with the different molar masses and end chemical groups; and various types of poly(1-O-(vinyloxy) ethyl-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside) (P(AcGlcVE)) with the different molar masses and the same end chemical groups. The Perturbed-Chain Polar Statistical-Associating-Fluid-Theory (PCP-SAFT EoS) of Gross, J. AIChE, 51 (2005) 2556\u20132568, is applied here through its modification for the present polymer\u2013CO2 systems.

Using the cloud point pressure data of the present polymer\u2013CO2 systems, the parameters of the PCP-SAFT EoS are obtained for these polymers. The results show the present equation of state can correlate with the experimental cloud point data accurately so that the deviation of the experimental data with the calculated results is low.",

It is demonstrated that in spite of their significant density variations, the compounds under consideration can be included in the applicability range of CP-PC-SAFT. In addition, this model is an effective estimator of data in mixtures. However a major drawback of CP-PC-SAFT is the underestimation of vapour pressures away from critical points. A conceptually different predictive approach, namely the Hybrid Group-Contribution PC-SAFT (H-GC-PC-SAFT, Burgess et al., 2014) is considered as well. Although this model is often less precise than CP-PC-SAFT, in several cases, such as the low temperature vapour pressures, it exhibits noticeable advantages.",

The conditions for the fractionation of fatty acid were selected to obtain good-quality oil for biodiesel production. Finally, an experiment was conducted under different conditions in which the greatest amount of free fatty acids (FFA) (26.3\u00a0wt.%) was extracted during the first fractions and then the pressure was increased to achieve good oil removal (91\u00a0wt.% oil yield) performance with low content of free fatty acids (1\u00a0wt.%).

The results showed that asphaltene transformation in SCW\u00a0+\u00a0NaOH gave higher asphaltene conversion, maltene yield and coke yield but less gas yield compared with those in SCW at 400\u00a0\u00b0C during 120\u00a0min. Moreover, a longer reaction time and higher temperature could enhance asphaltene reactivity but led to secondary decomposition of maltene and the formation of more gas and coke in SCW\u00a0+\u00a0NaOH. Kinetic analysis indicated that asphaltene transformation in SCW and SCW\u00a0+\u00a0NaOH both fit first-order kinetics adequately.

Activity enhancement was verified for free enzymes (Palatase 20000 L and Lipozyme CALB L) treated at mild conditions; while the highest temperature and pressure and the longest exposure time assayed led to activity losses. On the other hand, activity losses or no significative effect of the treatment in the enzyme activity were observed on immobilized enzymes (Lipozyme RM IM and Lipozyme 435). Qualitative studies were also performed: Fluorescence emission spectra showed changes in the conformational structure of both two free enzymes after SC-CO2 treatment. Scanning electron micrographs showed morphological alterations in the immobilization supports of the treated enzymes; while infrared spectra did not show chemical modifications.",

A comparison of the performance of the new models with those of Sovov\u00e1\u2019s and VT-II models shows that the first proposed model, with three adjustable parameters, produces in many cases an average deviation that is similar to that produced by the Sovov\u00e1\u2019s model, and is lower than that by the VT-II model, a remarkable result given the simplicity of the model. In addition, the second proposed model, which only has two adjustable parameters, performs well as compared to the rigorous models especially in the first period of the extraction and can be useful for generating first estimates of the parameters for data correlation with the first model. These results indicate that the proposed models are simple, useful and quick tools for correlating experimental data on supercritical extraction of natural matters.",

These catalysts catalyzed water gas shift reaction and the main products were CO2 and H2. CH4 was formed from CO and H2 produced by water gas shift reaction in the presence of Ru/C.

The kinetics of water gas shift reaction was analyzed with an elementary-like reaction model using fugacity. The model calculation represented the trend of experimental results and revealed that the suppression of water gas shift reaction in high water density region was probably because water would cover on active sites and stabilize the adsorbed species on catalyst to decrease the ratio of vacancy of active sites on catalyst.",

Also, process technology is not restricted to any specific application. It includes processing of renewable (bio-based) materials, fossil materials, and processes to access these materials. In general, process technology related to the application of supercritical fluids is based on the exploitation of the specific properties of supercritical fluids. This includes the varying properties of supercritical fluids and the interactions of supercritical fluids with the processes materials, such as a drastically reduced viscosity. Supercritical fluids guarantee an enclosed processing with emanations that can be adjusted. Supercritical fluids have been used in quite a number of processes and process steps related to production of energy, mostly in laboratory and demonstration scale. Among these processes are: the ROSE process, coal liquefaction and gasification, the production of oil from oil shales, and of oil from oil sands. Supercritical fluids have been proposed (and partially are used) for: enhanced oil recovery, emulsion splitting (oil\u2013water), enhanced gas recovery, bitumen separation, recovery of hydrocarbons from particles (remediation of soil), de-asphalting, removal of fine particles, and others. Supercritical fluids are proposed for deep drilling (spallation drilling), and for the production of energy from hydrothermal flames.

A thermodynamic model able to predict phase behavior of typical mixtures found in biomass processing technologies, containing for instance hydrocarbons, organo-oxygenated compounds and water, is required for the development of a biorefinery process simulator. Moreover, the design of particular fuel/biofuel blends also requires the support of a thermodynamic model to predict the properties of the final products. These types of mixtures are highly non-ideal due to the presence of association and solvation effects. It has already been proved that the Group Contribution with Association Equation of State (GCA-EoS) is able to predict the complex phase behavior of mixtures containing natural products and biofuels. In the last few years, several contributions agree that 2,5-dimethylfuran has a great potential as a sugar-derived fuel additive.

The cell was then pressurized in the range of 6\u201312\u00a0MPa at temperatures varying from ambient (298\u00a0K) to 323\u00a0K.

     "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the bioeconomy, there are major developments in the biorefinery concept to maximize utilization of renewable resources, including grains of cereals and oilseeds, targeting applications not only in food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products but also in biofuel, biochemical and biomaterial sectors. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) technology could have a major role to play in modern biorefineries. Know-how has been building on individual unit operations based on SC-CO2, especially extraction, fractionation and reactions involving lipids and particle formation for delivery of bioactives as summarized in this study mostly based on the previous work of the authors. Based on a solid understanding of fundamentals, the focus is now on optimal integration of these unit operations to build supercritical biorefineries. Such approaches should also consider integration of supercritical operations with conventional technologies for efficient and optimal process design. Even though the future of supercritical biorefineries seems to be bright, offering numerous advantages, there are also some substantial technical and economic challenges requiring further research.",

This contribution provides some perspectives on drivers and opportunities for new or advanced applications of supercritical fluids, including the search for sustainable processes and healthy products. It also addresses some of the needs, such as using refined modeling tools with a specific treatment taking into account the long range fluctuations in the density (or composition for the case of mixtures) as one approaches the critical point to accurately design the process in this region. New results are presented on the application of the crossover soft-SAFT equation of state to two motivating systems involving supercritical CO2, the CO2\u2013water mixture and the solubility of supercritical CO2 in fatty acid esters. Both systems are challenging from a modeling perspective as they are highly non-ideal. Crossover soft-SAFT gives very accurate results, compared to available experimental systems, for the CO2\u2013water mixtures. The equation is also able to predict the critical line in quantitative agreement with experimental data with one constant binary parameter, being a step forward in modeling the behavior of this mixture. The equation also gives excellent results when modeling the solubility of supercritical CO2 in fatty acid esters, with two binary parameters, independent of the temperature and composition, in this case.",

In this work the state of the art of SCWO has been reviewed, focusing on energy production. For the description of thermodynamic and transport properties, there are some methods recommended for pure substances, but the applicability of those methods for mixtures at supercritical state is yet not clear. Most of the work found in literature use cubic equations of state and linear mixing rules. The design of reactors has evolved in order to reduce the drawbacks of corrosion and salt deposition, in general, through the dilution of reaction products. In order to make the process profitable energetically different strategies must be used to keep the products at the highest temperature without compromising the safety, and the hydrothermal flames if correctly stabilized are a good choice. Reactors and reaction systems able to process feeds consisting of suspension with high inorganic contents without diluting the effluent reducing its temperature must be developed. On the other hand, the systems of energy recovery must be improved, especially the expanders, in order to recover the pressure work as well as the thermal energy. Modeling tools can help in both aspects. But for developing good models a good comprehension of thermal and transport properties of mixtures at supercritical state, as well as oxidation kinetics under that condition are essential data that must be further investigated in order to find energetically efficient processes.",

     "abstract": "Supercritical water upgrading (SCWU) of heavy oils reduces sulfur content and decreases average molecular weight, without rejecting carbon as coke products. Despite many years of industrial and academic scrutiny, many fundamental questions remain in the field: intrinsic reaction rates and mechanisms; the role of water; the need for catalysts; the importance of phase behavior and mixing. In 2009, MIT initiated a SCWU research program aimed at improving the understanding of the relevant physical, chemical, and catalytic phenomena. This overview summarizes the work performed at MIT within the historical context of SCWU with a particular focus on new kinetic rate measurements and modeling, reaction mechanism analysis, catalyst investigation, and combined mass/heat transport modeling of hydrocarbon/water mixtures. Kinetic rate measurements showed that sulfide decomposition during SCWU is consistent with a radical chain reaction pathway. Mechanistic studies and product distribution analysis identified that sulfide decomposition likely occurs via thioaldehyde and aldehyde intermediates and that water plays important roles in thioaldehyde hydrolysis (as a reactant) and aldehyde decarbonylation (as a catalyst). Catalytic investigation found that ZnO has potential to improve sulfur removal during SCWU, without addition of molecular hydrogen. Mixing studies revealed the complex dynamic processes that occur when hydrocarbons are injected into near or supercritical water. The article concludes with a summary of research needs and thoughts on the future of SCWU.",

     "abstract": "The solubility of hydrogen in an ionic liquid (IL) is important for hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation used in biomass transformations. In this work, we formulate an enhancement ratio (ER) for H2\u2013CO2\u2013IL systems that is defined in terms of the ternary system H2 molality, the binary H2 molality at constant temperature and the isofugacity condition. Literature data were used to demonstrate the utility of the definition for ER and to develop a predictive model for ionic liquids that dissolve cellulose. The ER is greater than one when CO2 can be used to increase H2 solubility in the IL. Although the solubility of H2 in many IL can be enhanced by CO2, for some ILs the presence of CO2 reduces H2 solubility in the IL. The ER for [hmim][Tf2N] was found to be less than one at low CO2 concentrations. Temperature affected the ER of ionic liquids in different ways with some IL exhibiting maximum hydrogen solubility ([bmim][PF6]) and others having an ER that monotonically increased with temperature ([Tf2N]-containing IL). Correlation of the ER with literature data is proposed in terms of Henry's constant of H2 and CO2 and the solubility parameter of the ionic liquid. The correlation was applied to six ionic liquids at conditions of 313\u2013453\u00a0K and at CO2 molalities up to 5\u00a0mol/kg to give a sum of squares of the residuals of 1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 in \u0394 m H 2 . Solubility enhancement ratios for H2 gas by CO2 for ionic liquids that dissolve cellulose were estimated with the predictive model to be as high as 1.2 per unit molality CO2 in the IL. Vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium measurements of mixed gases (H2\u2013CO2, CO\u2013CO2, O2\u2013CO2) with ionic liquids that dissolve biomass are urgently needed to promote development of methods for transforming biomass into biofuels and chemicals.",

Despite multiphase phenomena, the vast majority of the reaction occurs in the reactant-rich liquid phase. The kinetic rate constants were comparable with traditional organic solvents. The reaction rates were higher in the CXL mode than in the initially supercritical mixtures.

     "abstract": "Despite industrial application for almost four decades, there is reluctance in some world regions to adopt supercritical (sc) CO2 extraction because of the wrong perception that it is not fully competitive. To refute this misconception, this manuscript analyzes economics of scCO2 extraction of vegetable oil from prepressed seeds. Selection of this application was due to the availability of a predictive mathematical model of the extraction process applicable for simulation purposes; inner microstructural changes of oilseeds during prepressing allow their extraction according to a shrinking core hypothesis. The predictive model has as its single parameter a particle-size and scCO2-condition-independent microstructural mass transfer factor that can be best-fitted to laboratory extractions, existing literature correlations to estimate other model parameters, such as the axial dispersion in packed beds operating with supercritical fluids, and the solubility of vegetable oils in scCO2. On the other hand, there is a need to correlate literature data for the film mass transfer coefficient to unveil the factors responsible for experimental data scattering. Because laboratory or pilot plant runs in single-extraction-vessel units cannot produce the simulated countercurrent contact in an industrial plant having \u22653 extraction vessels, mathematical simulation provides the relationship between oil yield and extraction time that can anchor precise estimations of extraction cost. Analysis of results unveiled differences in optimal extraction time (for minimal extraction cost) between production costs estimated in this work and the operational costs informed before. Because the operational cost does not include the capital cost of the industrial plant, the need appears to reduce its contribution to the total cost by increasing plant productivity. This is achieved reducing extraction time, which negatively influences oil yield.To make further progress in the optimization of industrial scCO2 extraction processes, this manuscript proposes refining the mathematical simulation approach, and studying those technical constraints whose manifestations become more prevalent on scale-up. Mathematical simulation can be adapted to alternative, sample-pretreatment dependent mass transfer mechanisms in the solid matrix. It can be refined also to account for the size distribution of the substrate, radial changes in superficial scCO2 velocity, axial changes in pressure, and radial/axial changes in temperature resulting from heterogeneous packing, pressure drop, and/or heat transfer from/to extraction vessel walls that may influence large-scale extractions. Large-scale experiments will allow studying these phenomena, as well as technical constraints to the decrease in particle size, increase in scCO2 velocity, and decrease in extraction time imposed by the agglomeration and decrease in packed bed permeability of the substrate, and thermal effects during reconditioning of extraction vessels. The latter effects should be included as restrictions in the optimization of the extraction process, which may limit the extraction rate and the size or number of extraction vessel that impact economics positively. Close collaboration with industry will facilitate tackling large-scale problems, as well as refining estimates of plant cost as a function of its size and/or configuration.",

     "abstract": "The supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) process has attracted increasing interest over the recent decades. This is particularly motivated by concerns regarding the environmental effects of using traditional organic (potentially toxic) solvents. However, the conventional process of extraction using supercritical solvents has a slow dynamics even when solute free solvent is re-circulated and therefore improvements in the extraction process are required. The use of acoustic waves represents a potential efficient way of enhancing mass transfer processes in the supercritical region. Mass transfer enhancement using high amplitude resonant acoustic waves is investigated in this study. To carry out the investigation, three different cases are simulated. Acoustically augmented flow and transport in supercritical fluid (CO2) generated by resonant standing wave in a cylindrical shaped resonator (case 1) is simulated first. Based on the knowledge gathered from the simulations of the first case, simulations of acoustically augmented flow and transport in supercritical extraction systems, namely \u2013 in a fixed bed extractor (case 2) and membrane contactor (case 3) are also carried out. The oscillatory flow fields in these cases are created by the vibration of one of the end walls of the systems. A real-fluid model for representing the thermo-physical and transport properties of the supercritical fluid is considered. The fully compressible form of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations is used to model the flow fields and an implicit time-marching scheme is used to solve the equations. Due to diverging thermo-physical properties of supercritical fluid near the critical point, large scale oscillations are generated even for small sound field intensity. The effects of near-critical property variations on the formation process of the streaming structures are also investigated. Predicted results from these simulations confirm that acoustic waves significantly accelerate the kinetics of the supercritical extraction process, especially in the near-critical region of operation and improve the final extraction yield. These improvements are attributed to an increase in the overall convective mass transfer coefficient.",

Research in our laboratory has focused on the use of pressurized fluids to obtain phytochemicals from potato peel, lentil husk, barley hull, lupin hull, among others to later be used in some applications.

Results indicated that the total phenolic and carbohydrate contents and antioxidant activity of these biomass systems increased with temperature. The optimum phytochemical production and total antioxidant activity of each biomass were obtained using specific pressurized fluids. For example, the highest carbohydrate extraction from barley hull was obtained using pressurized aqueous ethanol, but this pressurized fluid was not the best for phenolics removal.

OECs were initially measured in batch mode (BM) and the kinetic parameters for the constant extraction rate (CER) period were determined to be lengths of the CER period (tCER) equal to 43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 and 42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0min for E-1 and E-2, respectively; mass transfer rates (MCER) of 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0g/min for both E-1 and E-2; and total yields (RCER) of 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 and 49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0g of extract/100\u00a0g of extractable mass for E-1 and E-2, respectively. No differences were observed between each group of kinetic parameters (tCER; MCER; RCER) obtained in BM. Following the measurement of OECs, the SFE system was operated in pseudo continuous mode for four extraction stages of 60\u00a0min each with the extractors organized in parallel. This organization improved the productivity of the process. We also proposed the integration of SFE with low-pressure solvent extraction (LPSE) using water and ethanol as solvents to remove bixin from the defatted annatto seeds. LPSE conditions were: 60\u00a0\u00b0C and solvent mass to feed mass ratio (S/F) of 8\u00a0g\u00a0solvent/g annatto for ethanol and 50\u00a0\u00b0C and S/F of 8\u00a0g\u00a0solvent/g annatto for water. LPSE assays were performed in an agitated bed over a 95\u00a0min time period. Using partially defatted annatto seeds as the feedstock for LPSE resulted in increased bixin extraction. LPSE with ethanol was found to increase the bixin content in the extract. Thus, the proposed process integration appears to be useful, mainly due to three aspects: (1) the initial removal of the oil layer via supercritical CO2 favors bixin extraction, (2) LPSE is a low-cost methodology for extracting bixin and (3) the cost of raw material in the second step is null.",

Environment damages such as water, soil and air contamination are global concerns, and are the main reason for the development of different strategies to use agricultural and industrial residues as source of new products. To apply the food wastes, environment-friendly processes are recommendable, in which renewable sources are used and the products do not offer environmental risks. Sub- and supercritical fluid technologies can meet such requirements when using green solvents. This review gives an overview of the potential of food residues as raw materials for the production of nutritionally interesting compounds, chemicals and biofuels.

     "abstract": "This paper reports an integral continuous process of polymerization and micronization of powder coatings using supercritical CO2 as solvent. Combining different process steps into one single process, using ultra short production chains, can be one future use of supercritical fluids. This contribution is therefore an example of how such integral processes can be designed and how the development of new products can look like using supercritical fluids. An acrylic resin consisting of glycidyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate and styrene was chosen as polymer system for use of thermosetting material for acrylic powder coating application. The reaction was performed in a tubular reactor. A monomer conversion of more than 96% was achieved with short reaction times of about 30\u00a0min at a temperature of 135\u00a0\u00b0C and at a pressure of 30\u00a0MPa in a homogeneous CO2 phase. The resulting polymer has a number average molecular weight of about 2500\u00a0g/mol with a narrow polydispersity index of 1.6. In this process, the synthesis step in compressed carbon dioxide was followed by a high pressure micronization using the well-known PGSS process. Thus, small particles of about 25\u00a0\u03bcm were obtained. Simultaneously, residual monomers were removed from the polymer product with the escaping CO2-gas, achieving a high purity grade. The process is designed as a straight forward process combining synthesis, micronization and purification of a polymer without depressurization between the unit operations and demonstrates the benefits which supercritical fluid technologies offer for product and process development.",

Unlike the classical polymerization methods that include the use of a metallic catalyst in organic solvent medium, the main goal of this work is to report the synthesis of polycaprolactone using a commercial enzyme, Novozym 435, as catalyst, together with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as solvent medium in order to establish a clean-technology process. The enzymatic production of PCL was carried out in pressurized LPG medium trough a set of experiments assessing the influence of pressure (120\u2013280\u00a0bar), solvent/monomer ratio (2:1\u20131:2 mass ratio) and enzyme content (by monomer weight, 5\u201315 wt%) on the reaction yield, number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polidispersity index (PI). Kinetic experiments were also conducted in batch using LPG as solvent to evaluate the influence of catalyst content and pressure on reaction yield, Mn, Mw, PI with the reaction time. Furthermore, the enzyme reuse was also evaluated in order to reduce the impact of enzyme cost on the process. Continuous mode polymerizations using CO2 as solvent were also carried out for reactions at 120 and 200\u00a0bar, 65\u00a0\u00b0C and solvent/monomer mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:2. Results from ANOVA statistical analysis for the first set of experiments show that the pressure has no significant influence over the parameters evaluated, while the solvent/monomer mass ratio and enzyme content presented significant effect on reaction yield. Polymerization results for the kinetic assays indicated reaction yields up to 81 wt% with Mn up to 15,000\u00a0Da and Mw up to 23,000\u00a0Da for 20\u00a0h of reaction, and PI ranging from 1.2 to 1.7 for the batch reactions and reaction yields up to 60.1 wt% with Mn 21,700\u00a0Da and Mw up to 36,800\u00a0Da for 10.7\u00a0min of reaction, and PI ranging from 1.7 to 2.1 for the PBR (Packed Bed Reactor) reactions. The condition of 25\u00a0bar, 2:1 solvent/monomer mass ratio, 3 wt% of enzyme, 65\u00a0\u00b0C and 8\u00a0h of reaction was selected for the enzyme batch reuse experiments, which indicate technical feasibility of enzyme reuse. Finally, future directions and some perspectives on the field of enzyme-catalyzed biopolymer production in compressed or supercritical fluid media are addressed.",

     "abstract": "Polymer foams, especially those based on biodegradable polymers, are in high demand for energy saving applications, for example as thermal insulations or packaging materials. To understand and predict the quality and material properties of polymer foams, concise knowledge of the factors influencing the foaming behaviour, especially pressure and temperature, is required. Therefore, three biodegradable polyesters, namely poly (lactide) (PLA), poly (butylene succinate) (PBS) and a blend of poly (lactide) and poly (hydroxy butyrate) (PLA-PHB), have been subjected to a direct foaming procedure using compressed carbon dioxide as blowing agent, studying the influence of saturation temperature (ranging from 95\u00a0\u00b0C to 175\u00a0\u00b0C) and applied pressure (ranging from atmospheric pressure to 30\u00a0MPa) on the resulting foam material. As these results are strongly depending on the melting behaviour of the polymers, all three polymers were subjected to calorimetric analysis in a scanning transitiometer that allows for applying pressure levels of up to 45\u00a0MPa. The created porous materials were characterized by determining their density, porosity and morphology, using SEM analysis. Their mechanical behaviour was investigated by using compressive strength tests. It is shown that the quality of the produced foam structures and its properties is strongly depending on the foaming conditions. In order to obtain foams with a high quality, the saturation temperature and pressure have to be adapted to the phase transition liquid\u2013solid of the polymer\u2013gas system. The results obtained via scanning transitiometer represent the SLG-line of the binary systems polymer and CO2, and their influence on the foaming behaviour enabled the identification of ideal foaming conditions for the three polymers regarded in this study.",

The band-width of the edge-on lamella domains were found to increase with CO2 pressure, and further, observed to develop increasing level of mottling with pressure which were associated with the formation of radially oriented nano-pores. The formation of these nano-pores is interpreted as arising from the exclusion of CO2 from the crystal growth front and its accumulation in the inter-crystalline amorphous regions in between the bundles of the lamellar stacks.",

     "abstract": "Recently, the increase in the number of patients who require a hip or knee implant, combined with the reduction of age at which this implant is demanded, emphasizes the urgent need for the development of new materials with enhanced mechanical and tribological properties. In this work, a new technique called supercritical in situ precipitation (SCisP) has been employed to manufacture a blend made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with added vitamin E (UHMWPEvit) plus a hyaluronic acid (HA) derivative. The precipitation of the HA derivative within the pores of a porous UHMWPEvit preform allows getting a blend after the post-processing of the SCisP product. Blend characterization results report the reduction of friction coefficient and wear rate in comparison to reference UHMWPEvit, probably due to the improvement in the wettability that hyaluronic derivative produces. Manufacturing times and raw material consumption have been drastically reduced by SCisP in comparison to processes reported up to now. Moreover, preliminary studies varying the conditions of the process, i.e. the type of hyaluronic acid derivative, solvent and number of injections, establish the basis of this technique for further development and open an interesting route in the manufacture of medical devices.",

In single-step procedure, synthesis of a 1-month aged precursor was conducted directly in SCW medium; while, in two-step procedure, a temperature programmed-promotion approach was applied. For the later technique, first the aging of the fresh solution of reactants was carried out for 2\u00a0h at 80\u00a0\u00b0C followed by temperature increment to reach supercritical condition (T\u00a0>\u00a0372\u00a0\u00b0C, P\u00a0>\u00a0221\u00a0atm). The prepared powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The Al/Si ratio of synthesized montmorillonite was about 1.73 as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Furthermore, the effects of operational parameters, i.e. temperature, reaction time, and precursor aging were studied on purity and crystallinity of product. In spite of the high crystalline montmorillonite obtained from the two procedures, it was revealed that the two-step procedure had a significant effect on the crystallinity, surface area, and consequently, adsorption capacity of products compared to MMT obtained from a single-step method. High adsorption capacity indicates that crystalline TMA\u2013montmorillonite can be synthesized efficiently using two-stage procedure in supercritical water. Possible mechanism of montmorillonite synthesis in supercritical water was also suggested.",

Mn3O4 and MnO can be produced by the reaction starting from layered manganese oxides (\u03b4-MnO2) in a uniform supercritical process. Time effect can give rise to the transition to Mn3O4 under low temperature, but the prolonged time, under a temperature lower than 200\u00a0\u030aC, cannot cause this transition. Phase diagram is obtained, including three regions of MnO2, Mn3O4 and MnO as the main material phase. The completion of transition accompanies with an oxygen loss course. Comparison between supercritical oxidation of water and supercritical deoxidation of organic DMF demonstrates the unique mechanisms of supercritical processing. In terms of the surface contacting fluid, deoxidation kinetics has a reciprocal law of growing size for manganese oxides.

Power plants and industrial production plants \u2013 large point sources of CO2 \u2013 are often situated far away from storage locations, thus it is necessary to transport the resulting CO2-rich streams from the point of capture to the storage/utilization site. The CO2 quality required for transport may influence the choice of the capture technology and impose limits on the performance requirements.In order to design CO2 transport networks, it is important to have an accurate knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of CO2-rich mixtures containing small amounts of impurities. However, a suitable equation of state under the appropriate conditions for pipeline transport has not been clearly defined yet and different options may be used for different applications. For a quick evaluation of transport options, simple cubic EOS may be sufficient, but for accurate measurements of CO2 flows needed for fiscal purposes more accurate non-analytical EOS may be required.In this paper the results of different EOS, including both cubic equations and non-analytical equations, have been compared with P\u2013\u03c1\u2013T experimental data of binary mixtures of carbon dioxide with nitrogen, oxygen and argon obtained by the authors at the Energy and Environmental Laboratory of Piacenza (LEAP).

     "abstract": "Processing of wood into manufactured products generate significant amounts of residues. These residues usually are just dispensed, harming the environment and wasting the opportunity of making good use of part of the wood. In this study residual wood from Mezilaurus itauba was employed to produce natural extract of high aggregated value using supercritical fluid. The yield and composition of the extracts from supercritical fluid extraction were compared to the ones obtained using conventional extraction techniques (soxhlet and hydrodistillation), as well as when ethanol was applied as a co-solvent with the supercritical fluid. Supercritical extraction was performed at a pressure range from 8 to 22\u00a0MPa, temperatures between 38 and 52\u00a0\u00b0C, solvent density varying from 241 to 839.91\u00a0kg/m3 and 3\u00a0mL/min flow. The greatest yield in supercritical extraction was of 1.04% for a extraction setting of 22\u00a0MPa and 45\u00a0\u00b0C. The experiments using ethanol at 2, 5 and 8% concentrations in volume as co-solvent showed up to 1.56% yield in mass. The extractions by hydrodistillation and soxhlet were of 0.04 and 5.47% respectively. Important compounds were identified in the extracts of M. itauba, in its majority sesquiterpenes, and of special highlight \u03b1-Cadinol, T-muurolol, \u03b2-Cubebene \u03b2-Cariofilene, Germacrene-D, \u03b4-Cadinene, Naphtalene, \u03b1-Copaene and \u03b2-Bisabulene. For the kinetic description of the extraction using supercritical fluid the mass transfer models of Sovov\u00e1 and Mart\u00ednez were employed, as well as the empiric model of Barton. These three models showed similar errors for the evaluation metrics (mean squared error and average absolute relative deviation).",

We investigated the corrosion processes with microscopic (optical and scanning electron microscopy) and spectroscopic (energy dispersive X-ray and auger electron spectroscopy) methods. It showed that ammonobasic environments lead to the formation of a nitrited layer. Composition and thickness changes depending on the number of loads. The corrosion layer does not reach a steady state and therefore degenerates as consequence of cyclic ammonothermal loads. For ammonoacidic conditions on the other hand significant general corrosion occurred which is connected to the dissolution of the metal phase in the supercritical.

Three types of cases are described: (i) subcritical jet injected into subcritical water, (ii) supercritical jet injected into supercritical water, and (iii) supercritical jet injected into subcritical water. In each case, the working pressure was kept above the critical value to eliminate two-phase effects. For cases (i) and (ii), the transition behavior follows well known characteristics with transition to turbulence initially occurring near the tip of the jet with the transition location moving upstream nearer to the nozzle exit with an increase in injection Reynolds number. However, the transition behavior for case (iii) is quite different with significant buoyant effects leading to turbulent behavior at lower Reynolds numbers. Consideration of the pseudocritical region with strongly varying fluid properties, which is established in the mixing region between the jet and the cell fluid, yields an effective Froude number that is useful to elucidate this difference. The effective Froude number incorporates the Prandtl number of the mixing region to account for the large disparity between viscous and thermal length scales.",

In this article we focus on the influence of organics, in this case glycerol and its hydrothermal degradation products, on the continuous salt separation performance. In the presence of organics higher temperatures are needed in the salt separator for an efficient salt separation and recovery due to a higher overall fluid density in the presence of glycerol compared to the density of pure water at the same conditions. Increasing temperatures in the salt separator lead to an increased degradation and, in particular, gasification of the glycerol. The salt studied, i.e. K3PO4, catalyzed the gasification of the glycerol to CO, H2, CO2, and CH4 as well as the water gas shift reaction. Due to the increased glycerol gasification at 460\u00a0\u00b0C in the salt separator, the fluid mixture density was lowered to similar values of pure water under the same conditions. Hence, at the fluid temperature of 460\u00a0\u00b0C in the salt separator the same salt separation performance was observed for water\u2013K3PO4 and for an aqueous mixture of 20\u00a0wt.% glycerol with K3PO4.",

XRD pattern at 6\u03b8 angle shows characteristic peaks of crystalline NiO, NiSi, and AlNi3, suggesting that Al2O3\u2013SiO2 not only offers high surface area (122\u00a0m2\u00a0g) for Ni, but also changes the crystal morphology of the metal. 9\u00a0mmol/g of H2 and 3.5\u00a0mmol/g of CH4 were produced at the conditions that 5.0\u00a0wt% alkaline lignin plus 1\u00a0g/g Ni/Al2O3\u2013SiO2 operating for 30\u00a0min at 550\u00a0\u00b0C. A kinetic model was also developed, and the activation energies of gas and char formation were calculated to be 36.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22 and 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0kJ/mol, respectively. Although the loss of activity surface area during reuse caused slight activity reduction in Ni/Al2O3\u2013SiO2, the catalyst system still possessed high catalytic activity in generating H2 and CH4. It is noted that sulfur linkage could be hydrolyzed to hydrogen sulfide in the gasification process of alkaline lignin. The stable chemical states of Ni/Al2O3\u2013SiO2 grants its insensitivity to sulfur, suggesting that Ni/Al2O3\u2013SiO2 should be economically promising for sub/supercritical water gasification of biomass in the presence of sulfur.",

     "abstract": "This article deals with a study of bitumen conversion (the gross-formula CH1.47N0.01S0.007) in a supercritical water (SCW) flow continuously supplied at the bottom of the vertically located tubular reactor. At the first stage, bitumen was continuously supplied from the top of the reactor into a counter-current SCW flow (400\u00a0\u00b0C, 30\u00a0MPa) for 60\u00a0min. At the second stage (after ceasing the supply of bitumen into the reactor), SCW was pumped through the layer of bitumen residue at uniform (2.5\u00a0\u00b0C/min) temperature increase from 400 to 700\u00a0\u00b0C at 30\u00a0MPa. The amount and composition of the liquid and volatile conversion products were measured. It is revealed that during bitumen supply into the reactor and subsequent pumping of SCW through the layer of bitumen residue in the temperature increasing mode from 400 to 500\u00a0\u00b0C, the yields of liquid conversion products are equal to 26.9 and 45.4%, respectively, relative to the weight of bitumen supplied into the reactor. Oils are the major components of these liquid products. Participation of H2O molecules in redox reactions became evident due to the formation of CO and CO2 even at 400\u00a0\u00b0C. A significant increase in the yields of H2, CH4, and CO2 are detected at T\u00a0>\u00a0600\u00a0\u00b0C. Based on the sulfur balance, it can be stated that the degree of bitumen desulfurization at 400\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C due to sulphur removal in form of H2S accounts for 21.6\u00a0wt.% A solid carbonaceous bitumen residue, obtained after SCW conversion, is characterized by high specific surface (224\u00a0m2/g).",

When the water and n-decane streams enter the mixer at inlet temperatures of 800\u00a0K and 700\u00a0K respectively (\u0394T\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0K), the flow remains laminar and the variations of density and viscosity with temperature do not have a significant impact on the flow and mixing dynamics. However, when the water inlet temperature is 1000\u00a0K (\u0394T\u00a0=\u00a0300\u00a0K), the water\u2013HC shear layer becomes unstable close to x\u00a0=\u00a05D downstream of the mixing joint followed by shear-layer rollup and transition to turbulence. This leads to significant enhancement in the mixing rate. However, in a simulation of SCW n-decane mixing with the same inlet conditions but with the physical properties held fixed at the inlet values (no variation with temperature), the shear layer remains stable and steady state is reached. It was found that, the large variation of temperature of 300\u00a0K within the mixing layer leads to an increase in the local fluid density and a decrease in the local fluid viscosity within the mixing layer attributed mainly to the cooling of water and the heating of n-decane respectively. These physical property variations result in an increase in the local Reynolds number within the shear layer rendering it unstable to perturbations in the flow. Thus, the variations in mixture density and viscosity with temperature under near-critical conditions were found to have a significant impact on the flow and mixing dynamics in the tee mixer.",

Chitosan is a biobased, biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide with antibacterial and cytocompatible properties. In this study, we aimed to generate chitosan particles with two processes using CO2 under pressure, in order to decrease the use of organic solvent and to obtain nanoparticles.The first is a supercritical anti-solvent process: CO2 acts as an anti-solvent toward an acetic acid aqueous solution of dissolved chitosan in which ethanol was added to enhance the anti-solvent effect. The reciprocal miscibility of CO2 with the solvents induces the reduction of their solvating power, leading to supersaturation at the capillary outlet and causing the crystallization of the particles.This process led to the generation of more or less agglomerated chitosan nanoparticles with an individual average size of 378\u00a0nm.In the second process, the pressurized CO2 is dissolved in water to lower the pH. This in turn allows the chitosan to be dissolved and the resulting solution is sprayed, thanks to the pressurized CO2, into a hot air stream. This new process allowed the generation of dried chitosan nanoparticles with a median size of 390\u00a0nm.",

To obtain diterpenes-enriched green coffee oil relevant for pharmaceuticals, a central composite rotational design (CCRD) was used to optimize the extraction process. In this study, pressure and temperature did not have influences on cafestol and kahweol concentrations, but did affect the total phenolic content (TPC), which ranged from 0.62 to 2.62\u00a0mg GAE/g of the oil. The analysis and quantification of diterpenes according to gas chromatography indicated that green coffee oil from SFE presented a cafestol content of 50.2 and a kahweol content of 63.8\u00a0g/kg green coffee oil under optimal conditions. The green coffee oil produced from conventional pressing methods presented lower diterpenes content of 7.5 and 12.8\u00a0g/kg green coffee oil for cafestol and kahweol, respectively. When SFE was used, the content of the diterpenes in the same green coffee beans was relatively higher, approximately 85% for cafestol and 80% for kahweol. Green coffee oil from SFE also presented fatty acids, such as palmitic acid (9.3\u00a0mg MAE/g green coffee oil), the polyunsaturated linoleic acid (\u03c9-6; 11\u00a0mg MAE/g green coffee oil) and oleic acid (\u03c9-9; 3.8\u00a0mg MAE/g green coffee oil). The physical properties for green coffee oil produced from SFE and conventional pressings showed that densities and viscosities decreased with temperature. For oils produced from both extractions, the density behaviors were similar with values ranging from 0.9419\u00a0g/cm3 (25\u00a0\u00b0C) to 0.9214\u00a0g/cm3 (55\u00a0\u00b0C) from pressings and 0.9365\u00a0g/cm3 (25\u00a0\u00b0C) to 0.9157\u00a0g/cm3 (55\u00a0\u00b0C) for the oil obtained by the SFE.

Results reveal that SBA-15 particles show excellent nucleation performance on polylactic acid foaming, and such nucleating effect are dependent on the surface modification.

The effect of the size and concentration of HA particles, as well as the effects of the plasticizer type and the incorporation route were investigated aiming to fabricate porous scaffolds with uniform morphology and controlled pore size distribution.

The palladium complexes with various loading amounts from 0.010 to 0.050\u00a0g in a high-pressure vessel were dissolved in supercritical CO2, and impregnated into Nafion membranes.The SEM images indicated that the palladium complexes were successfully deposited into Nafion membrane, and there were no problems such as cracking and pinhole. The EDX analysis showed that the palladium particles were distributed both at the membrane surface and also extended deeper into the membrane. The TEM images indicated that thin dense band of agglomerated Pd particles can be observed near the membrane surface, and a significant number of isolated Pd particles can be seen deeper into the membrane, when Pd(II) acetylacetonate was used as palladium complex. When palladium(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate and palladium (II) bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptane-dionato) were used, dense band of agglomerated Pd particles cannot be observed near the membrane surface, and small Pd particles were observed inside the membranes.The XRD analysis indicated that the crystalline peak of Nafion membrane at 2\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a017\u00b0 increased with the supercritical CO2 treatment.

     "abstract": "Asphaltene precipitation and deposition is a serious problem in oil recovery, oil transportation and refinery operations. Understanding of the phase behaviour of systems containing asphaltenes is very important to develop effective asphaltene deposition mitigation strategies. In order to get a better understanding of asphaltenes and in particular to get more insight in relations between molecular structural features and observed macroscopic behaviour, the phase behaviour of two poly-aromatic molecules (violanthrone-79 and hexa-tert-butylhexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene) was studied. Although both compounds do not represent all specific features of real asphaltenes, it is expected that to some extend they do. For instance, real asphaltenes are ill-defined mixtures and hard to characterize, while the selected poly-aromatic compounds form a well-defined system with toluene and CO2. The poly-aromatic compounds were selected based on their molecular features and their tendency to self-assemble. The phase behaviour of solutions of these compounds in toluene was studied in the presence of different concentrations of carbon dioxide with a so-called Cailletet apparatus. The results in this work showed that the concentration of carbon dioxide affects the precipitation of the poly-aromatic compounds. At low concentration there is no precipitation, i.e., carbon dioxide acts as a co-solvent, while at higher concentration, carbon dioxide acts as an anti-solvent and the poly-aromatic molecule in the ternary system precipitates. As far as the phase behaviour is concerned, hexa-tert-butylhexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene resembles that of a real asphaltene.",

A modified Henry model incorporated with Langmuir adsorption factor was proposed to correlate the solubility of CO2 in the PP/CNF composites with an average relative deviation less than 3%.

Extracts obtained from 15\u00a0MPa selectively concentrated 6-bromoisatin, at 78% of the extract composition, whereas increased pressures of 30 and 50\u00a0MPa increased the solvating power of supercritical CO2 to include the more lipophilic tyrindoleninone at 35 and 29% respectively, and tyriverdin at 23 and 40% respectively. This extraction method was also effective in separating the brominated indoles from toxic choline esters in the mollusc extracts.

     "abstract": "Bed geometry plays an important role in supercritical fluid extraction kinetics. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the overall extraction curves (OEC's) of rosemary compounds obtained in two beds of 1\u00a0L each with different geometries (in terms of height to bed (HB) diameter (DB) ratios, HB/DB). A scale-up study was carried out maintaining the solvent mass to feed mass (S/F) ratio equal for both beds. Other process variables, such as bed porosity, apparent and true densities of the raw material, particle average size, temperature, pressure and time of extraction, were also maintained constant. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the OEC to a spline model. The results revealed differences of mass transfer rates, mass ratios of solute in the fluid phase and yields of extract in the constant extraction rate period. The evaluation of the OEC's and kinetic parameters indicated that the bed with lower HB/DB ratio (HB/DB\u00a0=\u00a02.7) was more favorable for obtaining rosemary extract. The kinetics of extraction of oxygenated monoterpenes (i.e., 1,8-cineole and camphor) and phenolic diterpenes (i.e., carnosic acid) were also different for both bed geometries. These behaviors suggest that the bed geometry presents a pronounced influence in the mass transport properties in supercritical media. Thus, in spite of the scale-up criterion be successful for several botanic matrices such as clove buds, sugarcane residue and grape seeds residue, the criterion applied in this study (maintaining a constant S/F ratio for a given time of extraction) was not suitable for this raw material.",

We measured the internal and external pressures of a CO2 bubble covered with a rubber membrane using pressure transducers, and observed the bubble's oscillations by a high-speed video camera. We evaluated the maximum duration of the scCO2 for conditions 60\u00a0\u03bcs in experiments. We performed numerical simulations using the Rayleigh\u2013Plesset equation by substituting the experimental external pressure profiles of the bubble and confirmed that numerical results agreed with the experimental internal pressure. Moreover, in the minimum external pressure condition where we experimentally achieved the condition of scCO2 in the bubble for 16\u00a0\u03bcs by water hammer, we obtained the maximum duration of scCO2 conditions up to 55\u00a0\u03bcs by numerical simulations assuming isotropic compression.",

Ibuprofen release profiles were determined for simulated gastric and intestinal fluids in order to study the effect of the polymer and to identify the appropriate systems for different administration routes. The in vitro release profiles for both polymer/drug systems showed a slower and more controlled release in comparison to the unprocessed ibuprofen. Moreover, the effects of pressure, temperature, initial concentration of the solution and drug-to-polymer ratio on the particle size and morphology of these drug/polymer systems have been evaluated. According to the XRD, DSC and FTIR data, physicochemical interactions do not occur between ibuprofen and the polymers and a proportion of the ibuprofen molecules probably remained on the microparticle surface.",

The morphology and structure of synthesized PAniG NC was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Synthesized PAniG NC was used to modify the barrier properties and cathodic protection behavior of a commercial zinc rich epoxy primer (c-ZRP) on low carbon steel (CS) substrate. The protective properties of original and modified ZRPs (m-ZRP) were investigated using open circuit potential (OCP) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. It was found that after immersing coated CS for 365 days in 3.5% sodium chloride solution the OCP for m-ZRP remained at the cathodic protection region (lower than \u22120.86\u00a0V/SCE), while for c-ZRP it was passed out of protection region after immersing 100 days.

Influence of the CO2 saturation temperature on the foaming mechanism and on the foam structure has been studied in 90/10 PMMA/MAM blends and also in the neat (amorphous) PMMA or (nanostructured) MAM polymers, in order to understand the role of the MAM nanostructuration in the cell growth and coalescence phenomena. CO2 uptake and desorption measurements on series of block copolymer/homopolymer blend samples show a competitive behavior of the soft, rubbery, and CO2-philic block of PBA (poly(butyl acrylate)) domains: fast desorption kinetics but higher initial saturation. This competition nevertheless is strongly influenced by the type of dispersion of PBA (e.g. micellar or lamellar) and a very consequent influence on foaming.CO2 sorption and desorption were characterized in order to provide a better understanding of the role of the block copolymer on the foaming stages. Poly(butyl acrylate) blocks are shown to have a faster CO2 diffusion rate than poly(methyl methacrylate) but are more CO2-philic. Thus gas saturation and cell nucleation (heterogeneous) are more affected by the PBA block while cell coalescence is more affected by the PMMA phases (in the copolymer blocks\u00a0+\u00a0in the matrix).",

Scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to analyze the blackberry bagasse undergoing SFE with and without ultrasounds and showed that ultrasound disturbs the cell walls, enhancing the release of the extractable compounds.

     "abstract": "This work employs liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide for the enhanced expression of fat from rendered materials, specifically a finished poultry meal. Current industrial rendering processes use continuous screw presses or expellers to remove fats from rendered materials; however, this process can leave 10 to 15% residual fat. The higher economic value for the fat and emerging markets for low fat rendered protein meals makes enhanced fat recovery desirable. Results from this work demonstrate the use of CO2 assisted mechanical expression where the rendered material is pressed in the presence of pressurized CO2. The fat content of the poultry meal was reduced from an initial 12.1% down to 2.3% after pressing. The optimal conditions for a maximum expression were on the order of 40\u00a0\u00b0C, 210\u00a0bar of CO2, and 500\u00a0bar of effective mechanical pressure. An optimum effective mechanical pressure was observed at around 500\u00a0bar, which can be attributed to a reduced permeability of the CO2\u2013fat mixture through the protein matrix at high mechanical pressures, as described by Darcy's law. At CO2 pressures greater than 172\u00a0bar, expression enhancement is negligible, likely due to a plateau reached for the viscosity of the oil\u2013CO2 mixture beyond such pressure. The primary mechanisms governing the enhanced expression were the reduced viscosity of the fat with CO2 dissolution; which increases the drainage of fat through the cake, and the confinement rupture due to swelling upon CO2 dissolution. Overall, it was demonstrated that high expression yields can be achieved when conducting a gas-assisted mechanical expression of rendered materials, using only a fraction of the amount of CO2 used for CO2-only extractions. Furthermore, the optimum operating conditions are suitable for application in screw presses or expellers currently used on industrial scales.",

The best operation condition for supercritical extraction was 300\u00a0bar\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C, given that the highest concentration of carotenoids was obtained, without the yield being significantly different from that obtained with 300\u00a0bar\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C, this extract had antioxidant activity comparable to that of commercial caffeic acid.",

Carlton was investigated. The parameters that were studied were CO2 density (temperature and pressure), flow rate and plant material particle size and pre-treatment. The highest yield (303\u00a0\u03bcg/g) was achieved by extracting 53\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcm particle-size powdered dried bulb material moistened with NH4OH (25%, v/v) at 70\u00a0\u00b0C, 220\u00a0bar (690\u00a0kg/m3) for 3\u00a0h. Other N. pseudonarcissus alkaloids such as O-methyllycorenine and haemanthamine were also obtained. N. pseudonarcissus alkaloids as free bases are highly soluble in CO2 at a high pH as opposed to the slightly soluble salt form in which they are generally found in plants. Therefore, plant material pre-treatment with a base is an essential step for galanthamine extraction. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results also revealed that the desorption of N. pseudonarcissus alkaloids from the plant material rather than the solubility of the alkaloids in the scCO2 plays a major role in this scCO2 extraction. This extraction method has a good potential for industrial application.",

The inhibition of insect growth was observed at higher concentrations due to the antifeedant action of the extract. At the lowest extract concentration (100\u00a0mg/kg), ingestion caused low pupal viability and adults presenting morphological deformities, which thus indicated a chronic toxicity effect.",

Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of pressed palm fiber provides an oil rich in carotenoids while subcritical water hydrolysis (SubWH) produces hydrolysates with high amounts of fermentable sugars. In this work, the effects of pressure (15\u201330\u00a0MPa) and temperature (318 and 328\u00a0K) on SFE of carotenoids were investigated. The SFE extract with highest carotenoid content was obtained at 318\u00a0K and 15\u00a0MPa (2.3% d.b., 0.81\u00a0mg \u03b2-carotene/g extract).

Nevertheless, extracts by supercritical extraction of black sesame seeds have not been applied in neuroprotection studies. The objective of this work was to investigate some process variables of supercritical fluid extraction in black sesame to generate extracts applicable in stroke research. Two isothermal (40 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C) were explored, combined with pressures that ranged from 200 to 400\u00a0bar, at a constant mass flow rate of 5.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0kg/s. The global yields ranged from 37 to 53% in dry basis. The highest mass yield was obtained at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 400\u00a0bar. The fatty acid composition comprised a high unsaturated/saturated ratio. Chromatographic analysis of phytosterol content in the high global yield extract revealed higher amounts of \u03b2-sitosterol\u00a0+\u00a0sitostanol, cholesterol, campesterol\u00a0+\u00a0campestanol\u00a0+\u00a024-methylene cholesterol, \u0394-5 avenasterol and stigmasterol, while lower levels of \u0394-5,24 stigmastadienol, brassicasterol, clerosterol\u00a0+\u00a0\u0394-5-23 stigmastadienol, \u0394-7 avenasterol, eritrodiol and \u0394-7 stigmasterol were present in the black sesame extract.

     "abstract": "There is a need for scientific research that evaluates the influence of important process variables on the scale up of supercritical technology. For supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), one of these variables is the extractor's bed geometry, which can be defined by the ratio of the bed height (HB) to the bed diameter (DB). A systematic study is needed to select suitable criteria that can be used to obtain similar extraction curves among beds with different geometries. In this study, maintaining a constant ratio of solvent mass to feed mass for two beds with 1-L volumes but different geometries (E-1: HB/DB\u00a0=\u00a07.1; E-2: HB/DB\u00a0=\u00a02.7) was confirmed as a successful scale up criterion. For constant values of the temperature, pressure and bed porosity, there is experimental evidence that the mass transfer rate is equal in the two beds when the solvent flow rate is high. When 0.6\u00a0kg of clove buds was packed in the beds, the extraction rates were 2.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 and 2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0g\u00a0extract/min for beds E-1 and E-2, respectively. However, when the solvent flow rate was lower, the extraction rates were 0.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 and 1.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0g\u00a0extract/min for beds E-1 and E-2, respectively. This difference in behavior between the extraction beds is associated with the axial dispersion of the fluid, which is more pronounced when the HB/DB ratio is increased. Thin particles tend to compact in the beds with high HB/DB ratios, which shorten the solvent passage. Non-isothermal profiles and differences in chemical composition of the extracts were also observed: 17% more \u03b1-humulene and 9% more eugenol were extracted in E-1 and E-2, respectively.",

It should be emphasized the environmental importance for treating wastes with PCB. For instance, Stockholm convention on POP established the elimination of the use of PCB in equipments, e.g., electrical transformers and capacitors, by 2025. The decontamination of materials containing PCB may be performed by supercritical extraction technology using carbon dioxide (CO2) as solvent. The first objective of this work was the formulation of a computational tool to correlate solubility data of aromatic compounds in supercritical CO2, using Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state. In a second step, a description of Askarel oil, like Araclor 1254, solubility in supercritical CO2 was provided for simulation purposes of the extraction process. PCB mixture has predominance of congeners: tetra, penta, hexa, heptachloro biphenyl, tri and tetrachlorobenzene. The calculation procedure was initially applied for a series of aromatic compounds (naphthalene, biphenyl, anthracene and phenanthrene) in order to validate the approach. Experimental solubility data collection has been elaborated from the literature, providing a systematic series of the studied aromatic compounds with CO2. The binary parameters for the classical van der Waals quadratic mixing rule (vdW2) were systematically estimated, together with a new set of Clausius\u2013Clapeyron solute vapor pressure in order to describe the temperature dependence and achieve experimental solubility uncertainties. Finally, the estimated parameters were used to simulate solubility values of Askarel oil as function of the operational conditions of extraction by a simultaneous solution of the equilibrium equations for each compound. The thermodynamic modeling demonstrated to be feasible for process analysis and design.",

     "abstract": "The production of biodiesel or fatty acid esters (FAE) from lipids with supercritical methanol (scMeOH) has gained interest in the last decade because it allows the direct transesterification of crude oils and fats. The reaction should be carried out above 593\u00a0K in order to achieve complete conversion. When milder conditions are set, also monoglycerides (MG) and diglycerides (DG), together with glycerol, are obtained as byproducts of the transesterification process. Acylglycerols are common food emulsifiers and surface active agents in many industrial cleaning products.The main goal of this work is to study the fractionation of FAE and acylglycerols by using CO2 as a green solvent. Mixtures of FAE, MG and DG were produced by partial transesterification of sunflower oil with scMeOH in a temperature range of 556\u2013605\u00a0K and using different methanol to oil molar ratios (between 20 and 50). Then, experimental data on phase equilibria of reaction products\u00a0+\u00a0CO2 were measured at 298\u00a0K and 313\u00a0K in a variable volume cell with windows. The measured data were used to test the predictive capability of the Group Contribution with Association Equation of State (GCA-EoS). The acylglycerols can be purified by near critical extraction of the FAE with CO2. The simulation of the extraction process working with CO2, in liquid or supercritical state, gives a concentration of acylglycerols higher than 99.8\u00a0wt.% in the raffinate phase with a concentration of FAE above 97\u00a0wt.% in the extract phase.",

The aim of this work is modelling the solubility of solid therapeutic compounds in supercritical carbon dioxide with and without cosolvents using semiempirical models. A comparative assessment of eight models is presented based on deviations, number of parameters, range of applicability (concentration of cosolvents and proximity to the mixture critical point) and cosolvent\u2013solute interactions.All equations provide an average deviation on solubility around 10%. The use of the Gonz\u00e1lez (with four parameters) and Reddy and Madras equation (with five parameters) is judged the most convenient as they have the smaller number of parameters and are applicable over a suitable range of cosolvent concentrations. In all cases it has been possible to relate the solubility behaviour to the cosolvent\u2013solute interaction and the concentration of cosolvent. However, deviations increase when conditions are slightly close to the mixture critical point.A modification is proposed through the introduction of a \u201cq exponential function\u201d. The modified q-models can be regarded as generalized models based on the Tsallis's statistical non-extensive entropy theory. In fact, the original Chrastil and Gonz\u00e1lez equation can be seen as a particular case of the q-Chrastil and q-Gonz\u00e1lez models.

     "abstract": "High-pressure carbon dioxide (CO2) is a potential alternative for perchloroethylene (PER), a common but harmful textile dry cleaning solvent. Previous studies have indicated that the particulate soil removal with CO2 is lower compared to that with PER, because of the low amount of mechanical action in CO2. It is the objective of this study to get more insight in the influence of various types of mechanical action on the cleaning results in CO2 dry cleaning. In the experiments, various mechanisms of mechanical action, such as rotating drum, CO2 spray, and ultrasound were investigated. Several types of textiles stained with different kinds of particulate soils were cleaned using 25\u00a0L and 90\u00a0L CO2 dry cleaning set-ups. The washing results show that liquid CO2 spray may be a suitable additional mechanism to provide textile movement. The average CPI of CO2 over all soils using the best combination of commercial machine and process was still 25% lower than the results with PER and 18% lower than the results with water, but 11% higher than K4 solvent while the average redeposition level was significantly lower, showing that CO2 has a good prospect as an alternative solvent to replace PER. An endoscopic camera has been installed in the 25\u00a0L set-up to get an insight in the textile movement inside the rotating drum. The results show that no plug formation occurs and the textile movement in CO2 is sluggish, which means that the mechanical movement of textile in CO2 dry cleaning does not follow the simplified tumbling-movement model which was developed in a previous study, and the mechanical action is much less than predicted.",

To overcome these problems and to increase extraction efficiency of boric acid, heterogeneous reaction between colemanite and CO2 dissolved in H2O was studied at and above supercritical CO2 conditions. Supercritical conditions enhanced the extraction efficiency of boric acid from colemanite mineral, with 96.9% boric acid extraction efficiency being obtained from CO2\u2013colemanite reaction at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, for 2\u00a0h of reaction time for particles in the range of +20\u201340\u00a0\u03bcm. A powder crystallized from filtrate of reaction was determined as H3BO3 and the solid formed at the end of reaction was characterized mostly as CaCO3 according to FTIR, XRD, TGA and SEM analyses. The use of supercritical CO2 as a leaching agent in colemanite does not only produce boric acid but also helps to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Based on these facts, supercritical CO2 as extractant makes this process green and sustainable for recovering boric acid from boron minerals.",

Through detailed investigation of the whole deposition process, including the dissolution of precursor assisted by the co-solvent, the diffusion properties of the precursor into the nano-scale channels of the substrate, and the interaction between the precursor and the substrate, we found that a small amount of precursors were reduced into Ag0 by ethylene glycol at the initial stage of the deposition. The resultant Ag0 then acted as nuclei leading to a non-equilibrium sorption of the precursor. The rapid adsorption of the precursor onto the substrate resulted in a high loading of Ag in a short deposition time and the formation of nanowire morphology. Furthermore, this method was successfully extended to other porous substrates such as \u03b3-Al2O3, SiO2 and KIT-6, demonstrating its great potentials in the synthesis of nanocomposites.",

Comparisons with reference data from a highly accurate empirical multi-parameter EoS demonstrate that the present thermodynamic model has reasonable accuracy for engineering purpose over a wide range of pressure and temperature. By combining it with a transport model which extends the kinetic gas theory with dense-fluid correction, the viscosity and thermal conductivity of DME are also reproduced well for the thermodynamic states from compressed liquid to supercritical fluid.",

In addition to the commonly studied [BF4]\u2212 and [NTf2]\u2212 anions, the solubility of these gases in ILs with the anions [N(CN)2]\u2212, [SCN]\u2212 and [Ac]\u2212 is also studied and compared among them, searching for the best system for separation purposes.A coarse-grained molecular model is proposed within the soft-SAFT framework for each newly studied IL based on structural information, guidance obtained from quantum calculations and previous work. The most adequate set of molecular parameters are selected from the ILs density description and from the ability to reproduce the N2O/CO2 solubilities in these ILs at the lowest and highest temperatures for which experimental data are available. A discussion about the association molecular parameters values and their relation with the anion nature is also presented.With these molecular models, the description of the high pressure phase equilibria of the binary systems composed of the two gases and the ILs referred above are described with soft-SAFT for the remaining isotherms. For most systems, the equilibria behavior of the mixtures is predicted without using any binary parameter. When good agreement with the experimental data is not achieved, a single temperature independent binary parameter is enough to allow a good description. Finally, Henry's law constants are calculated from soft-SAFT to evaluate the selectivity of those ILs for the CO2/N2O separation.",

     "abstract": "Microalgae represent diverse branch of microorganism that can produce a wide range of unique functional ingredients that can be used in food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and energy. Among them, Haematococcus pluvialis is known for accumulating the highest levels of a potent natural antioxidant, astaxanthin, which has demonstrated positive health effects. Therefore, the aim of numerous studies has been to develop novel and efficient extraction techniques to produce high-quality (purity and antioxidant activity) extracts, while complying with the Green Chemistry Principles. Supercritical CO2 (scCO2) emerges as an alternative to organic solvents because of its high selectivity and bioactivity-preserving qualities. Nevertheless, astaxanthin is a large molecule with low solubility in scCO2 that usually requires long extractions at high pressures. Ethanol has been used as co-solvent to increase astaxanthin solubility in scCO2. In this work, a Box\u2013Behnken experimental design was used to study the effects of operating pressure (20\u201335\u00a0MPa), temperature (40\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C), and ethanol content in scCO2 (0\u201313%, w/w) on the yield, astaxanthin content, and antioxidant activity of H. pluvialis extract. Results showed that ethanol content in CO2 has a more significant effect on all responses than pressure and temperature. These results lead us to investigate the effect of a further increase in ethanol content, up to the region of gas-expanded liquids. We studied the effects of temperature (30\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C) and ethanol content (50\u201370%, w/w) at a fixed pressure (7\u00a0MPa) on the same response variables using CO2-expanded ethanol (CXE). Results showed that temperature and ethanol content had a significant influence on astaxanthin yield and antioxidant activity. Also, the overall responses of CXE surpassed scCO2 extractions to match conventional extraction with acetone, maintaining high quality extracts, thus validating the use of this new type of green technology for extraction of high-value compounds.",

The work analyses the effect of particle diameter (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4\u00a0mm), superficial CO2 velocity (2.76, 5.52, or 11.0\u00a0mm/s), and number of extraction vessels (2, 3, or 4) on optimal extraction time and minimal operational cost. Keeping other variables constants, cost diminishes as particle diameter decreases. Although the optimal superficial CO2 velocity increases as particle diameter decreases, in the case of small (\u22641\u00a0mm) particles, substrate fluidization may place an upper limit to the superficial velocity. Within the studied region, best superficial CO2 velocities are 11.0\u00a0mm/s for particles smaller than 1\u20132\u00a0mm, 2.76\u00a0mm/s for particles larger than 3\u20134\u00a0mm, and 5.52\u00a0mm/s for particles in between. Keeping other variables constant, the cost of extraction of medium-to-large (\u22652\u00a0mm) particles decreases as the number of extraction vessels increases, at the expense of an increase in extraction time. However, because of a sharp transition wave that develops when extracting small (\u22641\u00a0mm) particles that separates fully extracted (downstream) from virtually unextracted (upstream) substrate within extraction vessels, two-vessel plants are best for small particles. The lowest operational cost observed in this work was USD 4.08\u00a0kg\u22121 oil for the extraction of 2-mm particles using 3.30\u00a0m3/h of CO2 (U\u00a0=\u00a02.76\u00a0mm/s) in a four-vessel plant.",

     "abstract": "Saponins are surfactants that reduce the surface tension of aqueous solutions, besides having pharmacological actions. In order to extract and fractionate saponins from Pfaffia glomerata roots and Hebanthe eriantha roots using supercritical technology, fractionated extracts were obtained from a sequential process in fixed bed using supercritical CO2 (scCO2), ethanol, and water as solvents. All extractions were carried out in four sequential steps, at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 300\u00a0bar. In the first step, pure scCO2 was used as solvent, while (a) scCO2/etanol (70:30, w/w); (b) ethanol, and (c) ethanol/water (70:30, v/v) were used as solvents in the three subsequent steps. The extracts were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and surface tension. The extraction yields of the four steps were 0.16, 0.55, 1.00, and 6.90% for P. glomerata roots, and 0.17, 0.58, 0.89, and 28% for H. eriantha roots, showing a predominance of high polarity compounds in these species. TLC analysis showed that the extraction process was selective according to the polarity of the solvent, and provided extracts containing different saponins, except for scCO2 extraction. The extracts from the extraction using ethanol\u00a0+\u00a0scCO2 (Step 2) showed the greatest ability to reduce the surface tension of water from 72\u00a0mN\u00a0m\u22121 (pure water) to 25\u00a0mN\u00a0m\u22121, suggesting that this step was the best for extraction of less polar saponins in the extracts. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) values were approximately 2 and 8\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121 for P. glomerata and H. Eriantha, respectively.

The experimental solubility data are correlated by literature empirical models. Mathematical models developed by Sovov\u00e1 are applied to describe the experimental extraction curves. Soxhlet extraction of lipids is also carried out, obtaining a similar fatty acids profile but proving to be less selective than SCCO2 method.

However, the understanding of thermal\u2013hydraulic behavior of supercritical fluids is still insufficient and a well prediction model has not been established, especially in rod bundles. In this paper, four turbulence models are assessed for simulating the Freon R12 flowing through a 7-rod bundle vertically and the simulated results are validated with experimental data. It is shown that the predicted results by all the turbulence models match the experimental data well in the region far from the pseudo-critical temperature. The \u03c9 type turbulence models predict the heat transfer deterioration qualitatively in the near-critical region. Strong non-uniform circumferential temperature distribution is observed in the vicinity of pseudo-critical temperature. The anisotropic turbulence models show that secondary flow structure has little impact on rod wall temperature while the mass flux distribution is non-uniform greatly among different sub-channels. It is interesting that the flow direction exhibits crucial impact on the mass flux distribution as well as the wall temperature distribution which is valuable for future experimental study and fuel assembly design.",

     "abstract": "The objective of this work is to study the flow dynamics and mixing of supercritical water and a model hydrocarbon (n-decane), under fully miscible conditions, in a small scale cylindrical tee mixer (pipe ID\u00a0=\u00a02.4\u00a0mm), at an intermediate inlet Reynolds number of 500 using 3-D CFD simulations. A Peng\u2013Robinson EoS with standard van der Waals mixing rules is employed to model the near-critical thermodynamics with the mixture binary interaction parameter obtained from a Predictive Peng\u2013Robinson EoS using group contribution theory (PPR78). The n-decane stream is introduced at the colder temperature of 700\u00a0K to ensure operation above the Upper Critical Solution Temperature (UCST, 632\u00a0K) of the water n-decane system while the water stream enters at a higher temperature of 800\u00a0K. Under these conditions, the flow in the tee mixer remains laminar and steady-state is reached. Mixing occurs predominantly due to the circulating action of a counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) in the body of the hydrocarbon jet entering from the top. This CVP is formed due to the reorientation of the streamwise vorticity pre-existing within the hydrocarbon jet as it flows down the vertical pipe of the tee junction. The advective transport is further assisted by a secondary flow of water from the bottom stream, around the hydrocarbon jet, toward the space vacated near the top of the downstream pipe section by the downward motion of the HC jet. The CVP becomes progressively weaker due to vorticity diffusion as it is advected downstream and beyond 10\u201312 diameter lengths downstream of the mixing joint, transport is mainly controlled by molecular diffusion. It was found that the variations of density and transport properties with temperature do not have a significant impact on the flow and mixing dynamics for a \u0394T\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0K between the two streams. Local cooling of the fluid mixture was also observed in the mixing of water and n-decane streams entering at the same temperature (initially isothermal). This cooling effect is due to the diffusion of species along a gradient in their partial enthalpy in the mixture. Such gradients in species partial enthalpies are non-zero under near-critical conditions even for initially isothermal flows due to the non-ideality of the fluid mixture under these conditions. This local heating/cooling effect at near-critical conditions could give rise to unexpected formation of phases when operating close to critical points.",

Both of these goals can be met through improving the efficiency of the boiler through increasing the operating pressure and temperature, although increasing steam temperature has been reported to be more economical than raising steam pressure. However, higher temperatures may lead to increased boiler tube failure through steam-side oxidation and fireside corrosion mechanisms. Ni-based alloys are candidate materials for these aggressive conditions. The study reported here is evaluating steam-side oxide growth in a given length of superheater and reheater tubes of ultra-supercritical boilers operating at 700\u00a0\u00b0C or higher/35\u00a0MPa steam condition under different presumed service conditions. A simple and inexpensive procedure to estimate the oxide scale growth and the metal temperature increase in a boiler tube over a period of time is proposed. Verification of the findings with the actual data from the power plants is provided. The oxide scale growth rates of nickel-based alloys at steam temperatures up to 750\u00a0\u00b0C seemed to be tolerable in service based on the procedures demonstrated here.",

A total data set of 465 experimental data belonging to 11 ionic liquids, which gathered from literatures, were used to develop a general correlation.

     "abstract": "The objective of this work was to study production costs for the supercritical CO2 extraction of a pre-pressed oilseed (packed bed with 2-mm particles) in a 2-m3 industrial multi-vessel plant operating at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 30\u00a0MPa, using a fully predictive mass transfer model to simulate the process. We modified the inner diameter (47.3\u00a0\u2264\u00a0D\u00a0\u2264\u00a065.6\u00a0cm) and number (n\u00a0=\u00a02, 3, or 4) of extraction vessels, and the mass flow rate of CO2 (Q\u00a0=\u00a03000 or 6000\u00a0kg/h), thus changing the aspect ratio of the extraction vessels (3\u00a0\u2264\u00a0L/D\u00a0\u2264\u00a08), and superficial velocity (2.71\u00a0\u2264\u00a0U\u00a0\u2264\u00a010.8\u00a0mm/s) and specific mass flow rate (6\u00a0\u2264\u00a0q\u00a0\u2264\u00a024\u00a0kg/h per kg substrate) of CO2. Production cost decreased when increasing the mass flow rate of CO2 or the number of extraction vessels (or when increasing q). Production cost did not depend on the geometry of extraction vessel for a constant specific mass flow rate of CO2, but it decreased with a decreasing of the L/D ratio of the vessel for a constant superficial velocity of CO2. For any given plant, the contribution of fixed cost items (capital, labor) to the production cost increased with extraction time, unlike that of variable cost items (substrate, CO2, energy), which decreased. Thus, there was an optimal extraction time that minimized production cost for each plant. This work proposes an expression for capital cost of an industrial multi-vessel plant as a function of the mass flow rate of CO2 (which defines the cost of the solvent cycle of the plant), and the volume of the extraction vessels (which together with number of extraction vessels define the cost of extraction section of the plant), with a scaling factor of 0.48 for both items. Under optimal conditions, capital cost represented 30\u201340% of the production cost, but uncertainties in capital cost estimates (about \u00b150% using the proposed expression) may largely affect these estimates. The lowest production cost estimated in this work was USD 7.8/kg oil for the extraction of prepressed oilseed in a four-vessel plant using 6000\u00a0kg/h of CO2. The mass flow rate of CO2 and number of extraction vessels also affected annual productivity that was about 360\u00a0ton oil for the same plant operating 7200\u00a0h per year. Oil yields were above 90% for both three- and four-vessel plants.",

This was the first attempt on the recycling of thermosetting epoxy resin. However, in order to maintain the strength of the recycled epoxy resin to that of virgin epoxy resin, the proper ratio of the recovered thermoplastic resin to virgin epoxy resin was determined. The recovered carbon fiber from CFRP maintained the shape of the plain fabric and the reduction of the tensile strength was less than 9% compared with the virgin one.

     "abstract": "A novel method is presented for measuring solubility in supercritical CO2 (scCO2), which can be used in conjunction with traditional cloud point measurements to obtain information directly on the soluble portion of a given sample and, ultimately, a much more informative data set. In this method, surfactant from a known amount of CO2 solution was transferred into an aqueous solution and the surfactant concentration of the aqueous solution was measured directly by HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography). In this work, the partitioning of a series of 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) alkoxylate surfactants among an aqueous phase (water or brine) and scCO2 as a function of electrolyte concentration, temperature, and pressure was also investigated. Surfactant partition coefficient was determined based on the reduction of HPLC measured surfactant concentration in the aqueous phase due to surfactant partitioning into CO2. An understanding of surfactant partitioning between brine and scCO2 is particularly important in the design of CO2 foam processes, particularly for surfactant stabilized foam in subsurface systems, where it can affect surfactant transport and foam propagation. In general, the solubility in scCO2 increased with pressure and decreased with temperature. The partitioning of the surfactants between CO2 and water phases was almost proportional to pressure, and decreased as temperature increased, where the latter held more sensitivity. The partition coefficient was very sensitive to surfactant formula. For the 2-EH-PO5-EOx series, the partition coefficient between scCO2 and the aqueous phase increased with decreasing EO content.",

However, we observe that a lower quantity of CO2 can be sorbed into PP and PET (7 and 8% respectively, at P\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0MPa). Comparing their thermodynamic behaviors and their intrinsic properties, we emphasize that a high CO2 sorption can be reach if on one hand, the polymer is able to form specific interaction with CO2 in order to thermodynamically favor the presence of CO2 molecules inside the polymer and on the other, displays high chains mobility in the amorphous region. PLLA and PEO fulfilled these two requirements whereas only one property is fulfilled by PET (specific interaction with CO2) and PP (high chains mobility).

In this study, structures and energies of the reaction system were determined by B3LYP/AUG-cc-pVDZ level of theory to explore the catalytic role of water molecule. The water-assisted retro-aldol reaction is the most favorable pathway among glyceraldehyde conversion. Water molecule participation in the reaction system lowered the threshold energies for both reaction pathways, suggesting that a water molecule acts as homogeneous catalyst. Comparing the threshold energy values between non-water and water-assisted mechanisms, the threshold energy difference in dehydration was found to be greater than that in the retro-aldol reaction. This large catalytic water influence on the dehydration means that the glyceraldehyde dehydration is more enhanced at fairly higher density conditions. The reaction analysis in terms of water molecule participation can explain the influence of supercritical water density upon the glucose conversion and the catalytic role of water molecule in molecular level.",

     "abstract": "From our earlier work it was found that the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate ([emim][FAP]) shows a very high carbon dioxide (CO2) solubility and a low methane (CH4) solubility, with the consequence that this ionic liquid has a high CO2/CH4 selectivity (M. Althuluth, M.C. Kroon, C.J. Peters, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2012, (51), pp 16709\u201316712). In this paper we measure for the first time the absorption capacity in the same IL of other small hydrocarbons, e.g. ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10). The solubility of these hydrocarbons in [emim][FAP] has been determined as a function of temperature and concentration by measuring bubble points and cloud points in a temperature window of 290\u2013365\u00a0K and at pressures up to 10\u00a0MPa, using a synthetic method. It was observed that at similar conditions the solubility decreases in the following order: C4H10\u00a0>\u00a0CO2\u00a0>\u00a0C3H8\u00a0>\u00a0C2H6\u00a0>\u00a0CH4. Maximum selectivities for CO2/hydrocarbon separations are established at the lowest temperatures. A comparison of the absorption enthalpies of the various hydrocarbons studied in this work showed that C4H10 has the highest value ( \u0394 h a b s \u221e = \u2212 17.27 kJ / mol ) , which is consistent with its highest solubility in [emim][FAP].Furthermore, it was found that at higher hydrocarbon concentrations in the binary mixture with [emim][FAP] a liquid\u2013liquid immiscibility occurred. In addition, it was observed that the second liquid phase can be dissolved in the IL at higher pressures. The chain length of the hydrocarbon had a significant influence on the liquid\u2013liquid immiscibility which may have consequences for the recovery of small hydrocarbons from natural gas streams.",

     "abstract": "In this study, a version of the SAFT-VR equation of state based on the Yukawa potential is used for modeling the solubility of diverse organic compounds, mostly drugs, in supercritical carbon dioxide. Prior to any calculations, the SAFT parameters of pure CO2 were obtained by correlating the vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium data within the range of 220\u2013300\u00a0K. The validity of these parameters was examined by applying them in prediction of the compressibility factor and density in wide temperature and pressure ranges. Due to dependence of the rest of the calculations on the sublimation pressure and lack of its experimental values for most of the solids, it was estimated through two main approaches: application of a group contribution method prior to correlating the solubility data, and calculating it in relation with temperature while correlating the solubility data. For each compound, the first isothermal set of the available experimental data was used for correlation and the rest were predicted. Adopting the same procedure for three empirical models and comparing the resulting deviation percents validated the superiority and high capability of this equation of state in correlating and particularly predicting the solubility in supercritical region. The predicted densities were also in very good agreement with the available experimental values.",

     "abstract": "Condensation phenomena occurring in the combustion chamber of a motoring engine were investigated using a single-fluid approach by applying the Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state to both the vapor and liquid phases. The phase transition process is modeled through thermodynamic equilibrium calculations that are based on an entropy maximization principle. The simulations show that condensation of pure nitrogen is not possible as it can only experience condensation through an expansion process. However, condensation was possible in the compression stroke for example cases of pure n-heptane and two selected binary mixtures. This is because the compression moves the fluid into the two-phase region, and when the fluid crosses the dew point line, condensation occurs with spontaneous heat release. The amount of liquid phase is found to increase as the compression continues. In the expansion stroke, the continuous relaxation leads to evaporation of the two-phase mixture, and hence the liquid phase is continuously depleted. For pure species, condensation is first observed in the bulk flow regions and then the extend of the two-phase mixture grows. After the whole charge is two-phase, the maximum liquid volume fraction and hence minimum entropy are found in the wall regions due to heat transfer effects. Similar observations were seen for mixtures. Finally, thermodynamic analysis of binary mixtures of pure n-alkane species with nitrogen shows that condensation was only possible in the diesel engine operation range if the fuel surrogate is n-dodecane or a heavier species.",

     "abstract": "Vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE) data has significant role in designing processes which include vapor and liquid in equilibrium. Since it is impractical to measure equilibrium data at any desired temperature and pressure, particularly near critical region, thermodynamic models based on equation of state (EOS) are usually used for VLE estimating. In recent years due to the development of numerical tools like artificial intelligence methods, VLE prediction has been find new alternatives.In the present study a novel method called Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) used for predicting bubble/dew point pressures of binary mixtures containing carbon dioxide (CO2)\u00a0+\u00a0cyclic compounds as function of reduced temperature of the system, critical pressure, acentric factor of the cyclic compound, and CO2 composition. A 333 binary equilibrium data points of CO2 and six cyclic compounds within temperature and pressure ranges of 308.15\u2013473.15\u00a0K and 0.5\u201327.71\u00a0MPa were used to develop the model. Results show that the proposed model is able to predict VLE data for binary systems containing supercritical or near-critical CO2/cyclic compounds with an acceptable average absolute relative deviation percent (AARD%) of 3.9381% and the coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.9980. For detection of the probable doubtful experimental data, and applicability of the model, the Leverage statistical approach performed on the data sets. This algorithm showed that the proposed LSSVM model is statistically valid for VLE prediction and the whole phase equilibrium data points are in applicability domain of the model.",

Moreover, at a concentration of 15\u00a0mg/mL with any other process conditions, tadalafil tended to partially aggregate in crystalline form with irregular particle shapes. The results of in vitro dissolution experiments showed good correlation with mean particle size and crystallinity of the SAS-processed particles, in that the highest drug concentration showed the least dissolution rate and vice versa.

Through analyzing the cell nucleation and growth processes, the foaming mechanisms of PS blown with supercritical CO2\u2013N2 blends have been studied. It was observed that the 75% CO2\u201325% N2 blend yielded the highest cell densities over a wide processing temperature window, which indicates the high nucleating power of supercritical N2 and the high foam expanding ability of supercritical CO2 would produce synergistic effects with that ratio in batch foaming. Also, the presence of supercritical CO2 increased the solubility of supercritical N2 in PS, so the concentration of dissolved supercritical N2 was higher than the prediction by the simple mixing rule. The additional supercritical N2 further increased the cell nucleation performance. These results provide valuable directions to identify the optimal supercritical CO2\u2013N2 composition for the foaming of PS to replace the hazardous blowing agents which are commonly used despite their high flammability or ozone depleting characteristics.",

T-CELs provide key information on the phase behavior of ternary systems, i.e., they are boundaries for the ternary three-phase equilibrium. A ternary system may have several T-CELs. It is desirable to have available a robust algorithm for computing complete ternary CELs, thus minimizing the need for user intervention. It is also important to reliably detect the key points where T-CELs originate or terminate. In this work, we propose to apply a numerical continuation method (NCM) for the fast and robust computation of T-CELs. We present calculated T-CELs for highly asymmetric systems showing the topologies that these lines define. We consider a model of the equation of state (EOS) type and use it over wide ranges of conditions. Such ranges are much wider than those previously considered in the literature. Our main conclusion is that models for the fluid phase equilibria of ternary systems may predict, for a given system, several T-CELs of varying types and topologies. Some of such topologies have been observed for the first time in this work.",

In the experiments, several types of textiles soiled with a mixture of motor oil and soot were cleaned using 1\u00a0L and 90\u00a0L CO2 dry cleaning set-ups. Using either ultrasound, stirring, liquid spray or bubble spray does not give a significant improvement on particulate soil removal from textile.

     "abstract": "The supercritical antisolvent technology is used to precipitate polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) particles and crystallise ibuprofen sodium (IS) crystals separately and in the form of solid dispersion together. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is used as antisolvent. For PVP particle generation, ethanol, acetone and mixtures of ethanol and acetone are used as solvents. The initial concentration of PVP in the solution was varied between 0.5\u00a0wt% and 1.5\u00a0wt%, the operation pressure between 10\u00a0MPa and 30\u00a0MPa and the composition of ethanol/acetone solvent mixtures between 100\u00a0wt% and 0\u00a0wt% of ethanol at a constant temperature of 313\u00a0K. Furthermore, the mean molecular weight of the polymer was varied between 40\u00a0kg\u00a0mol\u22121, 360\u00a0kg\u00a0mol\u22121 and 1300\u00a0kg\u00a0mol\u22121. An increase of the content of the poor solvent acetone in the initial solvent mixture as well as the usage of PVP with a higher molecular weight, leads to a significant decrease in mean particle size. At all the investigated parameters always fully amorphous PVP powder precipitates. For IS, only ethanol was used as the solvent, the initial IS concentration in the solution was varied between 1\u00a0wt% and 3\u00a0wt% and the operation pressure between 10\u00a0MPa and 16\u00a0MPa. A variation of these parameters leads to a manipulation of the size and the morphology of the crystallised IS crystals. Irrespective of the parameters used, always the same polymorphic form of ibuprofen sodium is produced. The solid dispersions were generated at different compositions of PVP to IS and with two different molecular weights of PVP at otherwise constant conditions. Fully amorphous solid dispersions consisting of IS and PVP together were generated at different ratios of PVP to IS.The mechanisms that control the final particle properties are discussed taking into account two different models for \u201cideal\u201d and \u201cnon-ideal\u201d solutes. Furthermore, the study of the \u201cunconventional\u201d SAS parameters, molecular weight and solvation power of the solvent shows that these parameters qualify to tailor polymer particle properties via SAS processing. Next to the investigation into the behaviour of both solutes separately, fully amorphous solid dispersions consisting of IS and PVP together were generated. While X-ray diffraction was used to analyze the crystalline structure of the particles, respectively, solid dispersions, their morphology was analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",

NAP release profiles were determined in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids in order to identify the best polymer to use for different administration routes. The in vitro release profiles of the NAP\u2013EUD and NAP\u2013PLA systems showed a slower and more controlled release in comparison to the untreated NAP. Moreover, the effects of pressure, temperature, initial concentration of the solution and drug-to-polymer ratio on the particle size and morphology of these drug-polymer systems have been evaluated. Although the morphology was spherical for both kinds of system, the NAP\u2013PLA particles are larger than the NAP\u2013EUD particles. A larger particle size is also obtained on using a lower pressure. However, the temperature did not influence, or only had a slight influence on, the particle size of NAP\u2013PLA systems but it did have an influence on NAP\u2013EUD systems.",

Rapid expansion of fluoropolymer solutions (0.3\u20131.0\u00a0wt%) with Ppre of 331\u00a0bar initiated from unsaturated conditions produced nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution of \u223c30\u201370\u00a0nm; whereas larger particles with broader size distributions and a lower degree of agglomeration were obtained when supersaturated solutions were expanded with Ppre of 172\u00a0bar, especially at Tpre (80\u00a0\u00b0C) \u2013 higher than the glass transition temperature (73\u00a0\u00b0C) of poly(TFEMA).

The observed negative excess molar volumes result from the large difference between the molecular volumes of the species involved, with the small carbon dioxide molecules occupying the empty spaces between the larger IL ions, supporting the notion that the carbon dioxide, upon dissolution, occupies essentially the bulk free volume since the IL does not significantly expand upon gas absorption. These results portray ionic liquids as a porous media, like a soft sponge, with a huge free volume in which large amounts of carbon dioxide are able to accommodate during the dissolution process.",

These differences are not only function of the specific reaction and experimental conditions considered, but also depend on the PFPE chain length (i.e. molecular weight of the species).",

At SCW conversion of asphaltite without addition of metals the yields of volatile and liquid products were found to be equal to 10.3 and 46.0%, respectively. The amount of oil in the liquid product was by 1.6 times higher than that in raw asphaltite. Hydrogen evolution during the oxidation of \u3008Al\u3009 and \u3008Zn\u3009 by supercritical water provided for the hydrogenation of asphaltite in situ. When \u3008Al\u3009 and \u3008Zn\u3009 were added, the portion of the insoluble conversion residue decreased from 44.5 up to 11.3 and 26.3%, respectively. The degree and efficiency of asphaltite hydrogenation with addition of \u3008Al\u3009 were higher than the ones with addition of \u3008Zn\u3009. The amount of O-containing substances in the products and the conversion residue was found to have increased as compared with raw asphaltite. At conversion without addition of metals, the bulk of oxygen was mainly concentrated in the conversion residue, while with addition of \u3008Al\u3009 and \u3008Zn\u3009 it was detected in the composition of CO and CO2. According to the GC\u2013MS, IR and NMR 1H spectroscopy data, addition of metals to asphaltite resulted in decrease in the content of sulfoxides and carbonyl-containing substances and in increase in the content of polyaromatic substances in the liquid products. When \u3008Al\u3009 was added to asphaltite, more than 70% of sulfur passed into H2S and when \u3008Zn\u3009 was added, more than 60% of sulfur passed into ZnS.",

A transparent reactor is built to study the fluid dynamics of transpiring flow, which are the foundation of reactor design and optimization. The results showed that the transpiring flow is anisotropic with respect to the surface of the transpiring wall due to both the static pressure and viscous resistance. Finally, the novel idea of using air as the transpiring fluid instead of water is presented in an attempt to alleviate current TWR problems such as high energy consumption, high volume of pure water consumption, and temperature fluctuation in the reaction area. A series of experiments and theoretical derivations demonstrate that this novel idea is feasible.",

     "abstract": "The convection heat transfer of hydrocarbon fuel at supercritical pressure has a great influence on the regenerative cooling technology of a scramjet engine. A three-dimensional numerical simulation was conducted for the convection transfer of hydrocarbon fuel in the cooling panel of a combustion chamber wall. And the flow field around the local flow blockage structure and the outlet flow rate distribution characteristics of fuel in the cooling channels were analyzed in detail. The results of analyses indicate that with the optimized local flow blockage structure, the outlet flow rate distribution of fuel among the cooling channels become more uniform, as the area of local flow dead zone decreases. However, as the fuel temperature increases, the dramatic variation of thermodynamic physical properties of fuel has a strong influence on the flow field around the local flow blockage structure. Especially, a local flow dead zone can be easily formed in the supercritical temperature region. Meanwhile, transverse pressure gradient around the throat region of blockage structure and additional loss, which is caused by turbulence fluctuation and energy exchange of fluid in the downstream area, affect the outlet flow rate distribution of fuel among the coolant passages seriously. It can therefore be concluded that the local flow blockage structure is more suitably designed in the subcritical temperature region by taking above-mentioned factors into consideration.",

During the reaction, the high temperature, high pressure and high H+/OH\u2212 concentration of SCW dissolved TNTs into MTQDs, and the intercalation property of the \u201cactive\u201d water clusters formed from the broken hydrogen bonding network facilitated the detachment of the MTQDs from the TNTs.

A higher amount of CO2 was dissolved in PC with increasing the dissolution temperature from 80 to 100\u00a0\u00b0C, with similar CO2 desorption trends and diffusion coefficients being found for both conditions. PC foams displayed an isotropic-like microcellular structure at a dissolution temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C. It was shown that it is possible to reduce their density while keeping their microcellular structure with increasing the heating time. On contrary, when dissolving CO2 at 100\u00a0\u00b0C and later expanding, PC foams presented a cellular morphology with bigger cells and with an increasingly higher cell elongation in the vertical growth direction with increasing the heating time.

     "abstract": "The foaming process has been traditionally performed at high temperature because the CO2 and the polymer should behave as a homogeneous solution. The addition of a solvent could avoid the high working temperature while the homogeneity is ensured. Among the terpene oils, limonene outlines as a good candidate to carry out the dissolution of polystyrene because it respects the green chemistry principle, it is highly soluble in CO2 and very compatible with the polymer.The sorption of CO2 is the first step of the foaming process. The presence of the terpene oil enhances the solubility of the gas which is solubilized in the Polystyrene as well as in the limonene. During the foaming process, many parameters can be tuned to customize the foams. In this work, a fractional factorial design of experiment was proposed to determine the effect of pressure, temperature, concentration of the solution, contact time and vent time over the diameter of cells, its standard deviation and the cells density. The proposed foaming process can be simply performed at mild pressure and temperature thanks to the presence of the solvent. The results showed that the most suitable conditions to foam polystyrene from limonene solutions are 90\u00a0bar, 30\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.1\u00a0gPS/ml Lim, 240\u00a0min contacting and 30\u00a0min venting.

The study of simple model compounds such as phenol and benzene is an essential preliminary step to elucidate the primary mechanism of char and gas formation from lignin compounds. A quantitative detailed chemical kinetics model for the primary pathways of phenol and benzene decomposition in SCW was determined using the reaction pathways for its decomposition under supercritical conditions. The activation energy of benzene decomposition (91.16\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121) in SCW is much higher than that of phenol (54.17\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121) under similar experimental conditions. This emphasized the importance of the substituent group (hydroxyl group) in the benzene ring to enhance its decomposition rate. In addition, the reaction rate parameters, which are deduced for the overall reaction network of its decomposition under similar conditions, show good agreement with each another. Hence, the reaction rates of these reaction pathways are successfully described in this study.",

For the purpose of the present study a temperature of 343\u00a0K was chosen as the working temperature for both employed methods since all studied polymers are in liquid state at this temperature. All samples were analyzed at isothermal conditions and in the pressure range from 0\u00a0MPa up to 30.0\u00a0MPa. A set of absorption experiments on the PEG/CO2 systems was performed using an external balance method. In order to validate results obtained by the new method they were compared to the data obtained at the same process conditions by a method using magnetic suspension balance (MSB).",

     "abstract": "A supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) assisted annealing technique is adopted to toughen polypropylene (PP) and its random copolymer with 3.8 wt% co-monomer content (PPR). By using this technique, PP with 4-time improvement in toughness or PPR with superior toughness are obtained. Meanwhile, the stiffness of the materials could be maintained. To understand the toughening mechanism, scanning electron microscope, wide angle X-ray diffraction, calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis and small angle X-ray scattering characterizations are carried out. It is demonstrated that the toughening mechanism is strongly related to the microstructure evolutions, including decreased chain density in the mobile amorphous phase, improved crystalline phase and improved rigid amorphous phase after annealing. These microstructure changes could result in higher cavitation ability and diminish inner stress in the amorphous phase, which consequently favors improvement in toughness.",

Three levels full factorial design of experiments and response surface methodology was used to model the system. A second order polynomial model was developed and used to predict the optimum conditions. Scaling up to a laboratory larger scale was also tested. The results indicated that SC-CO2 extraction was superior to other extraction techniques, but exhibited significant variations in yield with changes in operating parameters. In the developed model, it was found that the linear and quadratic terms of the temperature, as well as the interaction with pressure had a significant effect on lipid yield; whereas, their effect on lipid quality was insignificant. The best operating conditions, in the tested range, were 53\u00a0\u00b0C, 500\u00a0bar and 1.9\u00a0g\u00a0min\u22121, in which lipid extraction yield of 7.41% (dry weight basis) was obtained.

For example, operating at 13.3\u00a0MPa and 50\u00a0\u00b0C, and keeping T1 in the range (66\u201370)\u00a0\u00b0C, the specifications are attained with N and S/F in the range 16\u201330 and 88\u2013120, respectively.",

In this study, a new correlation for the prediction of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) thermal conductivity based 600 data points from the literature is proposed.

Polymers like polyethylene are usually depolymerized to their monomers in supercritical water or alcohols.

OPLS all atom force filed was used for molecular dynamics simulation. Root mean square fluctuation of monomers of polyethylene, radius of gyration, diffusion constant and hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area of polymer molecule is calculated in investigating supercritical solvents. The results showed that flexibility of both ends of molecule is more than flexibility of internal monomers in three supercritical solvents. Also, flexibility of polyethylene oligomer in supercritical water is greater than flexibility of polyethylene in supercritical alcohols. Compactness of polyethylene was increased during molecular dynamics simulation in supercritical water. Among three solvents, supercritical ethanol has greater diffusion constant than the other ones. Although single aggregate structure was not observed, ethanol comes closer to polyethylene molecule during simulation than the other solvents. It seems that supercritical water has two roles in depolymerization of polyethylene; solvent and reactant, but supercritical alcohols acts only as solvent.",

The predictions were compared with measurements obtained from the recently constructed S-CO2 compressor test facility called SCO2PE (Supercritical CO2 Pressurizing Experiment), based on existing liquid water technology. The objective of the experimental and numerical work is to obtain fundamental data for the design optimization of compressor and to measure the overall performance near the critical point and in the supercritical state.To simulate nonlinear behavior near the critical point of CO2, the fluid properties were implemented, via property table, in the computational analysis code. Before embarking in the CFD approach evaluation, a number of parametric runs were conducted to examine the order of errors induced by the property table resolution and to achieve grid convergence.The steady-state numerical predictions using the k\u2013\u03c9 SST model were found to return satisfactory results for liquid water and in the case of S-CO2 operating condition, quite far from the critical point. However, as the compressor operating condition approaches more toward the critical point; deviation from the reference data start to become more apparent. In the more challenging case, the disagreement with experimental data might be partially due to the modeling limitations but is also attributed to the subcritical region observed in the contour plot of the static pressure.",

The experimental results presented here help to highlight how to prepare cocrystals of theophylline (TPL) using a supercritical fluid-based technique to accomplish the required physicochemical properties of that active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The SEA process shows a strong versatility and feasibility towards the formation of highly pure theophylline cocrystals, using tetrahydrofuran as a solvent. The formation of TPL cocrystals with different types of morphology and dissolution behaviour/properties is induced by using different coformers, such as urea, saccharin, gentisic acid, salicylic acid, glutaric acid, sorbic acid, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid and nicotinamide. The solubility of each coformer in the dissolution medium of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) could determine the dissolving rate behaviour of the produced cocrystals. Consequently, the low-soluble coformers generate TPL cocrystals with a slow-dissolving rate, while the use of highly soluble coformers produces faster-dissolving TPL cocrystals. Albeit the SEA process operating temperature influences the mean cocrystal particle size, this technique shows a high potential as an effective cocrystal screening tool.",

The average HB number per water molecule is equal to 1.93, 26.4% out of the total amount of HBs formed by water molecules being water\u2013o-HBA HBs, and the rest being water\u2013water HBs. Evolution of hydrogen-bonded clusters has been analyzed, using instantaneous structures saved during the simulation. It was shown that water\u2013water HBs are less stable than water\u2013o-HBA ones.",

The salt precipitation may produce a severe loss of well injection which leads to a complete blockage of injection. The wells which located at south oil field of Iran are faced with such problems. The analysis of produced sediments shows that more than 93% of those compounds are sodium chloride (NaCl). Different mechanisms can affect the formation of deposit. By injecting supercritical methane into oil fields, it was proved that one of the most probable mechanisms in such condition is gas anti-solvent. In this work, two formation waters at different temperature and pressure conditions were evaluated. The results showed that significant amount of precipitation was observed in one of those water formations while in the other one no precipitation was detected. Furthermore, the effect of operating variables including temperature and pressure on the quantity of formed deposit has been investigated.

The study was made with a double point of view; firstly, desorption kinetics was analyzed by applying non-linear Lagergren model.

Likewise, temperature did not exert a marked effect on desorption kinetics.The irreversibility of the adsorption processes was confirmed from N2 and PNP adsorption analyses, although some differences were found.

Four materials have been considered as solid supports: two commercially available silica gels (4.1 and 8.8\u00a0nm pore diameter), the mesoporous silica MCM-41 (3.8\u00a0nm pore diameter) and a microporous faujasite of the Y type. Mono- and di-aminotrialkoxysilane were chosen for this study. The optimal operating conditions required to have free aminosilane in solution were first evaluated by studying the phase behavior of the system scCO2/aminosilane at different pressures and temperatures. FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine the chemical structure of the grafted species. Aminosilane uptake was estimated by thermogravimetric and elemental analysis. Densities up to 3\u20134 molecules of monoaminosilane per nm\u22122 were reached by using a small amount of a cosolvent together with the supercritical CO2. The samples were characterized in regards of thermal stability, showing that aminosilane groups were covalently attached to the amorphous silica surface in the mesoporous supports, but not in the microporous zeolite. Low temperature N2 and ambient temperature CO2 isotherms were recorded to establish the adsorptive behavior of the prepared hybrid materials. The amine functionalized MCM-41 and the 8.8\u00a0nm silica gel exhibited a significant higher uptake of CO2 at low pressures compared with the bare supports. On the contrary, for the 4\u00a0nm silica gel and the zeolite the adsorption decreased after impregnation.",

In this work, near critical and supercritical impregnation of thymol in linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) films was done in order to develop a new technique for preparation of active polymers to be used as food packages. The properties of thymol as a natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agent have motivated this study about the assessment of its migration from the polymer to different food simulant. Impregnation assays of thymol in LLDPE films were done in a high-pressure cell, where pure thymol was solubilized in supercritical carbon dioxide at 313\u00a0K and pressures varying from 7 to 12\u00a0MPa. This procedure allowed the preparation of plastic films with thymol concentrations ranged between 5100 and 13,200\u00a0ppm. Migration tests showed that the pressure applied during the impregnation procedure is a key parameter that affects the content of the active compound into the polymer, since thymol solubility in scCO2 and absorption phenomena in the polymer increased with the pressure. The correlation between experimental data and a phenomenological transfer model allowed the estimation of the diffusion coefficient of thymol in LLDPE, which was ranged from 7.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221213 to 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212\u00a0m2\u00a0s\u22121.",

Due to the hydrophobic nature of PP, the aqueous plating solution cannot diffuse into a plain PP substrate to form Ni\u2013P metal. In this study, a block copolymer PP-b-polyethylene oxide (PEO) (PP-b-PEO) was blended with PP by injection molding to modify the hydrophilicity of the PP-plate surface.

Five grades of PP with different viscosities were used to investigate the effects of the viscosity ratio of PP to PP-b-PEO on the blend morphology and the adhesiveness of the metal to the polymer.

     "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE) data is one of the most important information for designing and modeling of process equipment. Because, it is not always possible to completely carry out experiments at all of the possible operational temperatures and pressures range, generalized thermodynamic models, e.g. equations of state are constructed for computing of required VLE data. In this work, artificial neural network (ANN) was used to derive predictive models of bubble point pressure and vapor phase composition of binary ethanol (C2H5OH) mixtures. In the neural network model, it is assumed that the considered VLE data depend on critical properties, acentric factor, normal boiling point, liquid phase composition of the solutes, and temperature. The proposed ANN model has been constructed and trained with VLE experimental data of nine different binary systems containing C2H5OH collected from various literatures. Optimal configuration of the ANN model has been determined using minimizing the average absolute relative deviation percent (%AARD), mean square errors (MSE) and the maximizing the correlation coefficient (R2) between observed and predicted VLE data with the ANN model. By using this procedure a two-layer ANN model with twenty-three hidden neuron has been found as an optimal topology. The accuracy of our optimal two layers ANN model has been compared with the Peng\u2013Robinson cubic equation combined with Wong\u2013Sandler (WS) mixing rules including a Van Laar (VL) model for the excess Gibbs free energy. Comparison with available literatures data and Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state confirm that the present ANN model is more accurate and superior than the other published works.

     "abstract": "Dissolution with terpenic solvents is presented as an alternative and original route to recycle Polystyrene wastes at room temperature. Limonene was the chosen solvent to carry out the dissolution process because it presents high compatibility with Polystyrene besides being natural, non toxic and relatively low cost. The solvent removal is possible thanks to supercritical CO2 since it provides high solubility of Limonene and complete PS insolubility at moderated pressures and temperature. In order to determine the proper working conditions to conduct the precipitation of the polymer, accurate knowledge of the phase equilibrium for mixtures of carbon dioxide, Limonene and Polystyrene should be known.In this work, the solubility of Limonene in the ternary system CO2/Limonene/Polystyrene was determined. The phase equilibrium experiments were conducted in a variable-volume view cell employing the static method. These experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 298.15\u2013313.15\u00a0K, at pressures up to 15\u00a0MPa and in the concentration range of 0.05\u20130.80\u00a0g\u00a0PS/ml Limonene. Initially the binary systems were studied by means of equations of state: Peng\u2013Robinson in the case of CO2/Limonene and Sanchez\u2013Lacombe in the case of Limonene/PS and CO2/PS. Predicted data were collected together with the experimental to check the agreement and to determine the limits of the ternary system formed by CO2\u2013Limonene\u2013PS. It is indispensable to determine the behaviour of the ternary system to know completely the fluid phase equilibrium. The results indicate that the solubility of Limonene in the vapour phase is favoured by high pressure and temperature as well as low concentration.",

Also, a supercritical fluid extraction coupled with supramolecular solvent microextraction was applied for extraction and determination of ultra-trace amounts of sulfonylurea herbicides in soil samples.

The hops extracts were analyzed by electro-kinetic capillary chromatography (MECK).

Experiments were carried out by using a unique high pressure variable-volume view-cell equipped with a dual set of pistons and dual set of sapphire windows which permit measurements of both the transmitted light intensities for determination of phase boundaries, and the scattered light intensities for assessment of the mechanism and the kinetics of phase separation. The system allows the continuous recording of the piston positions and thus the solution densities as a function of pressure at a given temperature from which liquid\u2013vapor or liquid\u2013liquid\u2013vapor phase boundaries are easily assessed and the isothermal compressibilities and isobaric expansivities are readily evaluated. It is shown that these solutions display lower critical solution temperature (LCST) type behavior with respect to their liquid\u2013liquid (LL) phase boundaries and the LL phase separation proceeds via nucleation and growth for 2.0, 5.0, 25.0 and 34.9\u00a0wt% solutions and via spinodal decomposition for 9.0, 12.0, and 15.0\u00a0wt% solutions. It is shown that the LL phase separation pressure which is a function of temperature scales with the solution density and shifts to higher densities with increasing polymer concentration, with the rate of change of LL phase separation pressure with density becoming higher at concentrations above the critical polymer concentration. The compressibilities in the homogeneous mixtures are found to decrease with increasing PCL concentration. At pressures below the LL phase separation pressures, the rate of decrease in compressibility with pressure is higher which is interpreted as being a consequence of the difference in the phase compositions of the polymer-lean and polymer-rich phases that develop at pressures below LL phase separation. Isobaric expansivities increase with temperature at a given pressure. They become more sensitive to temperature at lower pressures. The excess volumes for all PCL solutions display large negative values, indicative of close-packing of the polymer plus solvent molecules.",

EL has been selected as a non-toxic biocompatible plasticizer for PLC to improve its foaming behaviour at low temperature. In particular, the control of the pore structure of PLC foams was achieved by the optimal combination of the EL molar fraction in the blowing agent mixture, studied in the range of 0\u20130.2%, the operating temperature, selected between 35 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, and the depressurization time going from 0.5 to 6\u00a0min. The results of this study demonstrate that a small amount of EL enhanced significantly the plasticization power of scCO2 and, depending on the operating conditions selected, allowed for the fabrication of PLC foams with low density and large pores.

Temperature dependences of the yield of liquid and volatile products and kinetic parameters of the process have been obtained. The yields of oil, resin, asphaltene and volatile products in relation to the coal organic matter (COM) are 23.2, 16.1, 5.1 and 14.1%, respectively. CO2, CO, H2S and C1\u2013C4 alkanes prevail in the composition of volatile products. The generation of oil, resin and asphaltene are found to have occurred in terms of the simultaneous chemical reactions of cleavage of the COM aliphatic CC bonds, while the volatile products result from the consecutive transformations of the COM components in the bulk and SCW solution. Participation of H2O molecules in thermochemical transformations of COM leads to increase in the oxygen amount in the conversion products and residue by 13.2%. Hydrogen and heat evolution during zinc oxidation by SCW provides for the hydrogenation of COM in situ. Addition of zinc to coal results in increase in the volatile products yield up to 48.6% and decrease in the conversion residue yield up to 20.8%. Under these conditions the yield of resin does not change, while the yields of oil and asphaltene decrease up to 21.2 and 2.5%, respectively.

The central assumption of the model is that, at the particular temperature and pressure, the aqueous species formed by dissolution of SiO2 are the same regardless of whether they resulted from dissolution of quartz or from dissolution of fused silica. Conceptually, the model combines a correlation of the aqueous solubility of quartz with a thermochemical cycle to estimate the ratio of the fugacity of fused silica to the fugacity of quartz. The existing experimental data on aqueous solubility of fused (amorphous) silica are used to build up the model, and they are reproduced by the model with an average relative deviation of 2.9%.

The influences of temperature, pressure, density and viscosity of the solvent mixture on the diffusion coefficients were examined. The results show that methyl oleate always diffuses faster than methyl ricinoleate at the same operating condition. Moreover, the D12 values in ethanol-modified scCO2 decrease with the increase of the number of C-C double bonds in C18-methyl ester, which is consistent with the trend reported in pure scCO2.

     "abstract": "In the supercritical antisolvent precipitation (SAS), the jet fluid dynamics is characterized by two-phase mixing at subcritical conditions, and by one-phase mixing at completely developed supercritical conditions. The amplitude of the pressure range, in which binary systems organic solvent/scCO2 exhibit the transition between two-phase to one-phase mixing, depends on the organic solvent that is in contact with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) and conditions the morphology of the microparticles produced by SAS. When this pressure range is wide, as in the case of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), solutes solubilized in the organic solvent can be precipitated as microparticles by atomization, droplets formation and drying; when this pressure range is narrow, as for acetone, gas mixing prevails and only nanoparticles are generally observed. Therefore, generally speaking, solutes that are soluble only in solvents exhibiting gas mixing in scCO2, do not exhibit microparticles morphology and this fact is a limitation for several industrial applications.In this work, a model compound, cellulose acetate (CA), that is slightly soluble in DMSO and freely soluble in acetone, was processed by SAS using mixtures of the two solvents that exhibit intermediate behaviors between the two pure solvents, to extend two phase mixing and produce CA microparticles. Using different DMSO/acetone mixture percentages, the effects of the polymer concentration in the liquid solution and of the pressure were studied. A mixture of DMSO/Acetone 50/50 (v/v), at a pressure of 85\u00a0bar and a concentration of the liquid solution equal to 40\u00a0mg/mL, efficiently produced non-coalescing CA microparticles with a mean diameter of 0.42\u00a0\u03bcm and a standard deviation of about 0.15\u00a0\u03bcm, demonstrating that this SAS strategy can be successful.",

In this study, coumarin was obtained from guaco leaves extracts by supercritical extraction under different experimental conditions according to a central composite rotational design (CCRD) with two independent variables, temperature (T) and pressure (P). Lower values of T were used to maintain the stability of thermosensitive compounds and because coumarin is highly soluble in supercritical CO2 even at low T. The responses surface analyzes (RSA) acquired by fitting of linear and quadratic models to experimental extraction yields and coumarin concentrations showed similar conditions for improving yields from both plant species. Although the extract yield values were similar for both plant species, coumarin concentrations were higher in Mikania laevigata than Mikania glomerata. The greater extract yield of 4.20% coumarin, related to the higher coumarin concentration (0.43\u00a0g\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0g\u22121 in guaco leaves), was obtained under extraction conditions of P above 175\u00a0bar and T above 45\u00a0\u00b0C.",

     "abstract": "Magnetic carbon nanotubes (CNTs); i.e., magnetic materials-filling or -coating CNTs, have recently been paid a lot of attention to particularly in the bio-medical field aiming to develop high resolution nano bio-imaging media, nano hyperthermia materials, nano drug delivery vehicles and nano-surgical robots. Fluids under their near-critical conditions, which are called near-critical fluids, are often used in chemical science and engineering; e.g., for the extraction of chemicals, and can also be utilised for an efficient synthesis of nanomaterials. Here, we functionalise CNTs with carbon-coating nickel/sulphur nanoparticles via self-assembly by mixing CNTs, nickelocene and sulphur with acetone and setting the solvent under sub-critical or super-critical conditions. We find that each nanoparticle is composed of a mixture of NiS and Ni3S2 covered with a carbon shell and that the size of the nanoparticle changes depending on the fluid temperature; i.e., the average diameter of the core nanoparticle increases with an increase in the synthetic temperature. Each CNT is also covered with a carbon layer. The CNTs immobilised with the carbon-coating nanoparticles show soft ferromagnetic characteristics. The magnetisation is also increased with an increase in the synthetic temperature. The present methodology may well be applied to the synthesis of other magnetic carbon nanomaterials such as magnetic fullerenes and graphenes, by dispersing fullerenes and graphenes in near-critical fluids, in which metallocenes and sulphur are dissolved.",

The first measure makes the quantification strategy independent of the refractive index, laser power fluctuations and changes in alignment, and is thus robust against variations of the operation conditions. The second measure circumvents the classical challenges related to the dynamic range limit of detectors, which is inherent to the quantification of minor compounds. Example solubilities of the wax alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) in CO2 were quantified at 333\u00a0K and a range of pressures from 10\u00a0MPa to 18\u00a0MPa.

The computational model was evaluated by comparing the predicted values to the ones measured experimentally. Model performance was also assessed through comparisons with another proposed model with a similar theoretical foundation, which was applied to spruce wood under different test conditions. The model was a relatively accurate predictor of internal pressure development at sub-critical pressures, while a greater disparity was observed at certain pressures above the critical point. These disparities were observed in the prior model as well, but were not as large, and the rationale for these findings is presented.

For each extraction technique and conditions three different raw materials were employed: spinach leaves, rosemary leaves and the mixture 50:50 of spinach and rosemary leaves.The antioxidant activity of the samples produced was evaluated with the ABTS assay and showed to be enhanced when the species are simultaneously extracted, with antioxidant values around 20% higher than the values corresponding to mixing the extracts obtained by separate. A possible synergic effect between carotenoids and phenolic diterpenes was studied, although no specific synergic activity could be observed. However, the enhanced antioxidant activity could be attributed to a definite increase of the concentration of carnosic acid, which was observed in the samples produced by the simultaneous extraction.",

In this study, recovery of EGCG supercritical extraction from green tea was modeled by hybrid of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and mathematical modeling with the constant distribution coefficient. Different ANFIS networks (by changing the type and number of membership functions and training algorithms) were compared with evaluation of networks accuracy in EGCG recovery prediction and subsequently the suitable network was determined. The obtained results in this work indicated that ANFIS was effective method for prediction of EGCG recovery and was successfully validated with experimental data. Finally the proposed hybrid model optimized with genetic algorithm in order to achieve maximum EGCG extraction recovery.",

The effect of process parameters such as extraction temperature and pressure, pre-expansion temperature, spray distance, and nozzle configuration on the particle size of adefovir dipivoxil was evaluated and it was found that the process parameters did influence the particles size. The solubility of adefovir dipivoxil in CO2 was measured for the purpose of setting proper experimental conditions. Increasing the extraction temperature (308.15\u2013328.15\u00a0K) caused the particle size of adefovir dipivoxil to increase. Particle size decreased with increasing extraction pressure (20\u201330\u00a0MPa). The particle size of adefovir dipivoxil increased with increasing pre-expansion temperature. An increase in the spray distance (8, 16, 32\u00a0cm) resulted in a decrease in the average size of particles. The effect of the internal nozzle diameter on the size and shape of the precipitated particles was examined using different nozzle internal diameters (152, 500, 762\u00a0\u03bcm). When the internal nozzle diameter size was larger, the particle size did not show significant change.

     "abstract": "A synthetic polymer generally consists of a mixture of many compounds that share the same repeating unit but have different degrees of polymerization. Because of its ability to cope with a wide range of molecular weights, supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is a powerful technique for separating the individual components of polymers. However, the separation conditions for SFC are more sensitive than those of other types of chromatography, and many experimental parameters need to be carefully selected to achieve high resolutions. Methods for optimizing the experimental parameters for SFC of a polymeric surfactant were investigated by chemometric techniques. Increases or decreases in peak resolution and elution times were measured for the separation by SFC of the nonionic surfactant poly(ethylene glycol) nonylphenyl ether for various column temperatures, flow-rate gradients of modifier, and modifier compositions. To maximize the separation efficiency, the experimental results were analyzed by using the chromatographic response function (CRF). This is a function of the desired peak resolution, the maximum acceptable elution time, and an arbitrary weighting factor that is adjusted to achieve an optimal balance between the peak separation and the elution time. Because the numerical value of the CRF changes in response to the chromatographic performance, it provides a means of identifying the conditions for achieving optimal separation for a particular SFC system.",

The experimental study verified that the most important emission sources for the organic compounds detected in the indoor environment were a wide variety of plastic materials and human activities (e.g., cooking). Particular features of some extracts were attributed to specific actions that took place in the house prior or during sampling, and/or to the materials used in the house construction or heating methods.

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used both to quantify carajurin, which is the main anthocyanin component of A. chica, and to monitor qualitatively two other anthocyanin pigments found in that plant. The extraction yield in the first step was only 0.65% using pure scCO2, but this extraction was highly selective to extract carajurin from the three main anthocyanins. The accumulated global yield of the two steps ranged from 3% when the solvent ratio (80/20/0) was used in the second step to about 50% when 6 or 10% water was used, showing the highest yield when the extraction was done with water.

Solutions with one or two solvents and rotenone suspensions were tested to perform the experiments. Different biodegradable polymer/pesticide ratios were tested: 2 and 8 in the case of PEG\u2fffrotenone coprecipitates, 25, 50 and 100 in the cases of PVP\u2fffrotenone and alginate\u2fffrotenone coprecipitates. The particles obtained were spherical with the mean diameter ranging between 0.6 and 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm. The effective loading of the particles was evaluated by HPLC and the best results were obtained in the case of alginate\u2fffrotenone coprecipitates that show a coprecipitation efficiency close to 100% and for PEG\u2fffrotenone particles the efficiency was about 98%. PVP\u2fffrotenone composite microparticles showed the lowest coprecipitation efficiency that ranged between 30% and 50%.",

     "abstract": "Modeling of supercritical gas antisolvent (GAS) process was carried out for ampicillin nanoparticles synthesis. The particle size distribution of ampicillin limits bioavailability. Therefore, the kinetic data are essential for the control of particle size. Volume expansion and phase equilibrium modeling was studied to determine optimal operating conditions for experimental ampicillin production. Experimental ampicillin precipitations with GAS process at various antisolvent addition flow rates were investigated. The process model was then studied for the determination of nucleation and growth rate parameters. Equation of state, material and population balance equations were used for this modeling. A combination of the Crank-Nicholson and Lax-Wendroff methods was utilized to solve the population balance equation. Comparison of the experimental and modeling data showed that the model successfully predicted the particle size distribution. The effect of antisolvent addition rate on nucleation indicated that nucleation was enhanced via higher antisolvent addition rate and consequently smaller particle size was obtained. The mean particle sizes of ampicillin were obtained to be 357.09, 337.04 and 356.68\u00a0nm at antisolvent flow rates of 1.6, 2 and 2.4\u00a0mL/min, respectively.",

Differential scanning calorimetry assays reveal modifications on the structure of the material, with formation of a solid solution in experiments with poloxamer carriers, and formation of solid dispersions with a possible reduction of the crystallinity of the carrier in experiments with GMS. Drug release tests in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids have been performed. Formulations with poloxamer carrier materials provided an increased solubility of ibuprofen in the gastrointestinal fluids, with a very fast release and dissolution of this compound, while gelucire and GMS carriers did not improve the solubility of ibuprofen, but provided a slower, controlled release of the drug. PGSS-processed samples presented a superior performance over physical mixtures in terms of the solubility increase and the control of the release rate. These results show the wide possibilities and flexibility of the PGSS technique for the development of hybrid formulations of water-insoluble active compounds with hydrophilic or hydrophobic carrier materials, achieving either an increased, accelerated dissolution, or a slower, controlled delivery, depending on the choice of carrier materials.",

In this work poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA), a biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic aliphatic polyester, has been processed using supercritical fluids, particularly by rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS) and supercritical antisolvent (SAS) processes over a wide miscibility range. Particle morphology was greatly improved from irregular blocks to spherical microparticles on applying the SAS process. The effects of changes in polymer concentration, liquid flow rate, nozzle diameter, solvent, pressure and temperature have also been evaluated on the particle size of PLLA in the SAS precipitation. A higher concentration of the initial solution led to a decrease in particle size. Dichloromethane was the best of the chlorinated solvents investigated. The nozzle diameter had a negligible effect on particle size and the highest liquid flow rate gave the largest particle size. A larger particle size was also obtained on increasing the operating temperature. In contrast, the particle size decreased on increasing the operating pressure.",

At high pressures of CO2, the experimental Q-factors agreed well with the predicted ones.

     "abstract": "Developing an understanding of the reaction processes occurring at the surface\u2ffffluid interface at the atomic level of nanostructured materials in high-temperature aqueous environments is necessary for establishing general principles of behavior of nanomaterials operating in such extremes. In situ Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were made on Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the presence of Co2+ ions in aqueous fluids to 500\u00a0\u00b0C and approximately 220\u00a0MPa. The results from analysis of the in situ EXAFS data, along with SEM-EDX spectra measured from reacted nanoparticles, indicate that adsorption of Co2+ ions on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is negligible at temperatures below 200\u00a0\u00b0C but becomes significant in the 250\u2fff500\u00a0\u00b0C temperature range. The low reaction temperature threshold of the Co2+ aqua ion with Fe3O4 nanoparticles is consistent with a relatively low value of the crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE) of Co2+ in octahedral site symmetry in spinels. Modeling of the pre-edge feature of the XANES and analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) shows that Co2+ adsorbs predominantly on octahedral sites of the surface of nanoparticles in aqueous fluids. Structural analyses using EXAFS and high resolution TEM show that the inverse spinel structure is preserved in the Co-incorporated surface atomic layers of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Our results suggest that the dissolved radioactive isotope 60Co in the primary cooling loop of supercritical water-cooled nuclear reactors have a high likelihood of precipitating on the surfaces of spalled ferrite nanomaterial.",

The bimetallic Pd\u2fffAg colloids were further applied as suitable partial hydrogenation (also known as semihydrogenation) catalysts for phenylacetylene. During total conversion, the selectivity to styrene was nearly twice as much when using the Pd25Ag75 colloids (87.5%) than the pure Pd colloids (46.1%).

The polymer foam probes were based on d,l-lactide and glycolide and prepared varying the operating conditions.

The influence of stirring speed and venting rate on the drug loading and the average pore size were evaluated in order to optimize the impregnation process.Venting rate revealed to be the most important factor affecting the probes pore size and their morphology. Slow venting rates should be used to promote small pores in order to retard the drug release from the polymeric matrix. Fast stirring rates improves the impregnation process because favours the contact between supercritical CO2 and the swelled polymer. The presence of glycolide enhanced the mechanical strength of the foam preventing pore collapse. This fact together with the possibility of regulating the rate of the scaffold degradation and the kinetics of drug release makes the usage of the copolymer more attractive for a further medical application.",

A comparison of the systems is made and their complementarity investigated by analyzing the data by different means, e.g. principal component analysis. The generic screening sequence is proposed by selecting the most enantioselective and complementary systems. This allows updating an existing screening strategy. With the novel screening, all compounds of a 57-compounds test set were separated (48 baseline), on at least one of four selected systems, within an analysis time of 30\u00a0min.

The results show a generally linear relationship between the phase transition temperature and pressure. No temperature inversions or three phase regions were observed. An increase in hydrocarbon backbone length leads to an increase in phase transition pressure. For ethane as supercritical solvent, this increase is linear. For propane as supercritical solvent, the nature of the increase was not quantified as the magnitude of the increase would be significantly influenced by the experimental measurement error as the observed increase is not very large. Comparison of the phase behaviour of ethyl esters with methyl esters shows very little difference, yet the phase transition pressure of ethyl esters in supercritical ethane and propane is significantly lower than those of the corresponding acids.

Current industrial processes utilize continuous screw pressing to extract fat from rendered materials, but the ability to minimize residual fat content is limited. In this work, liquid and supercritical CO2 were used to extract the remaining fat from rendered poultry meal. CO2 extraction offers high extraction yields with potential ecological and economic benefits for the rendering industry. A semi-batch extraction unit was used to investigate the effect of pressure (69\u2013345\u00a0bar), temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C, 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u00a0\u00b0C), flow rate, and mass of CO2 on the extraction yield and the fat solubility. Maximum extraction yields between 87% and 97% were obtained which produced a remaining fat content of 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0wt% in the extracted poultry meal. Fat solubility increased with pressure but decreased with temperature, providing liquid CO2 with the highest fat solubility (6.47\u00a0g/L) at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 345\u00a0bar. The Chrastil model successfully correlated the solubility data as a function of density and temperature, obtaining an AARD value of 5.56%. Gas chromatography was used to analyze the composition of fatty acids, obtaining similar results with those reported in the literature. It can be concluded that high fat extraction yields can be obtained using CO2 and that liquid CO2 is more effective than supercritical CO2 for the extraction of rendered fats under the conditions tested.",

High conversion rates can be possible when the extractive-transesterification of algal biomass is performed near-critical or supercritical conditions.

The effects of water and FFA content on the yield of biodiesel were investigated. The results obtained for the effects of water on the yield of biodiesel were compared with the supercritical methanol (SCM) process and conventional catalytic reaction. Results revealed that the catalytic reaction suffers from low yield with the presence of high water content in oil. Meanwhile, the yield of both the SCM and SCMA reactions were found to increase slightly with the increment of water content in the mixture. On the other hand, the results for the effect of FFA on the yield of biodiesel were compared with the SCM reaction. It was found that the presence of FFA has a negligible effect in both the SCMA and SCM reactions.

Efficient production of arabino-oligosaccharides (AOs) and feruloylated arabino-oligosaccharides (FA-AOs), which are AOs esterified with ferulic acid, from beet fiber was investigated. Under hydrothermal conditions at a reaction temperature from 160\u00a0\u00b0C to 180\u00a0\u00b0C for a reaction time of 5\u201315\u00a0min, solubilization of the beet fiber occurred in the range of 58\u201363\u00a0wt%. In the soluble fraction, galactose and arabinose as well as their oligomers have been detected. It is notable that various characteristic glycosides, which consist of ferulic acid and AOs or galacto-oligosaccharides (GOs), were obtained from the arabinan or galactan side chains of the pectin present in the beet fiber. The total yield of AOs and FA-AOs reached 84% at 160\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0min, which was determined as arabinose units contained in the beet fiber. Almost all the ferulic acid present in the beet fiber was recovered as ferulate esters of oligosaccharides such as AOs or GOs via hydrothermal treatment.",

Particularly, the recovery of antioxidants from different herbs is a matter of continuous research and development. Antioxidants can protect cells against the effects of free radicals and thus, play an important role in heart illness, cancer and other diseases.Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) has been recognized as one of the Lamiaceae plant with many important biological activities. Particularly, large antioxidant power has been recognized in rosemary and main substances related with this activity were the phenolic diterpenes such as carnosol, rosmanol, carnosic acid, methyl carnosate, and phenolic acids such as the rosmarinic and caffeic acids. Moreover, carnosic acid and carnosol are recognized as the most abundant antioxidants present in rosemary.In this work, supercritical fluid technology was applied to produce rosemary extracts with different compositions and thus, with different bioactivity properties. Selected extracts, from the variety of samples obtained, were used to study the capability of rosemary supercritical extracts to inhibit the proliferation of human liver carcinoma cells. These extracts showed a dose-dependent effect on inhibiting the proliferation of human hepatoma cells. Moreover, observed citostaticity appeared to be significantly influenced by their different composition, suggesting a relevant role of the technology to produce the extracts and the consequently obtained compositions on the potential antitumoral activity of rosemary.",

It is a liquid wax extracted from the seeds of Jojoba plant (Simmondsia chinensis) by mechanical pressing, followed by hexane extraction of the pre-pressed jojoba meal. Health and environmental concerns associated with the use of solvents like hexane have placed new demands on the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry to invest in clean technologies such as Supercritical Fluid Extraction. Jojoba oil is partially miscible with CO2 in the liquid and supercritical states. On the other hand, liquid propane has better solvent characteristics, since it shows complete miscibility with jojoba oil below 343\u00a0K. The main drawback of propane is its flammability; any percentage of it in a propane/air mixture above 2.15\u00a0vol.% will be enough to burn the propane. However, a 30\u00a0vol.% of CO2 in the vapor phase can be used to turn the mixture propane/CO2/air non-flammable.

The results were compared with data obtained from the traditional Soxhlet extraction process using three different solvents, namely n-hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol. Extractions with liquid CO2, recycled in continuous mode, of chaste tree fruits in three sizes: (1) <0.3\u00a0mm, (2) 0.3\u20130.8\u00a0mm, and (3) 3\u20133.2\u00a0mm resulted in maximum yields of 4.9%, 4.1% and 2.8%, respectively. Extraction times of 0.17\u201325\u00a0h were used. Extraction by continuous recycling of liquid CO2 is more efficient than Soxhlet-type periodic recycling of liquid CO2, resulting in up to three times higher yield for the same solvent-to-feed ratio. Comparison of HPLC data for extracts obtained by liquid CO2, n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol showed that the diterpene rotundifuran is best extracted by liquid CO2 (3.010\u00a0g/kg drug), and the flavonoid casticin is best extracted by n-hexane (1.067\u00a0g/kg drug).",

The first acylation step is moderately enantioselective, preferring the formation of (1R,2R)-2-acetoxycyclohexane-1-ol, while the second acylation step is fully enantioselective. Michaelis\u2013Menten type reaction constants and turnover number values were calculated.

The reactions were performed at 10\u00a0MPa and 45\u00a0\u00b0C. The mean residence time in the enzymatic reactor was varied from 2 to 13\u00a0s by changing the flow rate of the CO2.

     "abstract": "Poly (\u025b-caprolactone) (PCL) is a biodegradable polyester approved for applications in the human body such as drug delivery devices and sutures. Conventional synthesis of PCL involves metal catalysts and organic solvents that may leave toxic residues in the products and contribute to environmental pollution. Polymerization processes catalyzed by enzymes are becoming more attractive due to the importance of clean processes, which produces substances free of residues, ideal for pharmaceutical and food applications. The aim of this work was to investigate the enzymatic ring-opening polymerization (e-ROP) of PCL in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) solvent medium through a set of experiments assessing the influence of pressure (120\u2013280\u00a0bar), solvent/monomer ratio (2:1\u20131:2 mass ratio) and enzyme percentage related to monomer (5\u201315\u00a0wt%) on the reaction yield, number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (P.I.). The results of these first experiments were used in the selection of the conditions for the kinetic experiments evaluating the influence of catalyst content and temperature on reaction yield, Mn, Mw, P.I. and on the characteristics of the polymer produced. This study also evaluates the enzyme reuse in order to reduce the impact of the enzyme cost on the process. Results for ANOVA statistical analysis for the first set of experiments show that the pressure or the solvent density has no significant influence over the parameters evaluated, while the solvent/monomer mass ratio presented significant effect on Mn and on Mw, with the best results obtained for the solvent/monomer mass ratio of 1:2. As expected, the enzyme content affects significantly all parameters evaluated. Polymerization results for the kinetic experiments indicate reaction yields up to 90\u00a0wt%, Mn up to 13,700\u00a0Da and Mw up to 22,200\u00a0Da, with P.I. ranging from 1.2 to 1.7. Taking into account the reaction productivity, the conditions for the reuse assays were chosen: 120\u00a0bar, 1:2 solvent/monomer ratio, 3\u00a0wt% of enzyme, 65\u00a0\u00b0C and 12\u00a0h of reaction. The enzyme recycling experiments suggested viability up to the second cycle as an alternative to improve the enzyme use.

A bubble growth-induced cell nucleation phenomenon, where existing cells triggered the generation of cells around them, was observed under static conditions due to the presence of crystals. In the dynamic cases, the applied extensional stresses caused foaming to occur in a more dispersed manner. The bubble growth-induced cell nucleation phenomenon was also observed, but it occurred at a later stage and the effect was less dominant. These fundamental understandings will provide guidance to improve processing strategies of plastic foaming processes.",

There are a number of different methods to generate amorphous drug substances such as solvent deposition, co-milling (COM), spray-drying, melt-quenching and supercritical fluids technology. In this study, the effectiveness of a low-cost and easily scalable process COM was compared with the high-cost and precision-controlled supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) process to amorphize indomethacin (IDMC) with a water-soluble polymer excipient poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) to improve the physical stability of the IDMC amorphous form. Both COM and SAS precipitation were conducted at IDMC to PVP ratios of 60:40, 50:50 and 20:80. The untreated COM and SAS powders (before and after storage) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, morphology), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD, crystallinity), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, composition), gravimetric vapour sorption (GVS, moisture isotherms), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, drug\u2013polymer interactions), inverse gas chromatography (IGC, surface energetic and structural relaxations) and Raman mapping (RM, spatial distribution). Accelerated physical stability stress tests were also conducted on COM and SAS co-precipitates in open pans at 75%RH/40\u00a0\u00b0C in order to evaluate their physical stability. SAS co-precipitates with PVP contents more than 40\u00a0wt.% were X-ray amorphous form and remained stable after more than 6 months of storage at 75%RH/40\u00a0\u00b0C. COM powders with PVP contents less than 50\u00a0wt.% re-crystallized after 7 days of storage at 75%RH/40\u00a0\u00b0C. FTIR spectra suggested that hydrogen bonding formed between PVP amide carbonyl and IDMC carboxylic acid hydroxyl groups for all COM and SAS co-precipitates. Therefore, the amorphous phase present in COM and SAS co-precipitates could be stabilized by the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between IDMC and PVP which improved its physical stability against re-crystallization. IGC studies also revealed that different preparation methods used to generate the amorphous form have an effect on its physical stability in terms of surface structural relaxation as well as having different surface energetics. Overall the surface structural relaxation of SAS co-precipitate was slower than COM samples indicating that SAS co-precipitate was physically more stable than COM sample. Finally, this work has demonstrated the potential of using PVP as a suitable \u201camorphous inducing and stabilizing\u201d agent for a poorly water-soluble drug such as IDMC using co-milling and SAS processes.",

In this work polysaccharide-based superabsorbent aerogels are prepared using a combination of sol-gel and supercritical fluid technology. The advantages of supercritical drying are the reduced gel shrinkage, higher porosity, and three-dimensional network of the aerogel morphology compared to the morphology obtained with conventional air or vacuum drying methods. The aerogel open-porous structure and high surface area promotes rapid water absorption into the aerogel matrix by capillary force. Aerogel structural properties are modified by using different cross-linking ions and different alginate molecular weights and the influence of the aerogel properties on water absorption capacity is presented. Scanning electron microscopy is used to characterize the aerogel surface morphology, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements are used to obtain information on the aerogel surface area, pore size, and pore volume. A unique feature of alginate aerogels is that they absorb more saline compared to distilled water, which is opposite to the behavior of regular superabsorbents. A gram of alginate aerogel absorbs as much as 120\u00a0g of saline (0.9\u00a0wt% aq. NaCl solution) solution compared to 20\u00a0g of distilled water.

Encapsulation has been studied for two types of core solid nanoparticles, namely suspended and in situ produced particles from solution. Mechanisms for both types of encapsulations have been proposed: for the former type deposition happens because of mass transfer from the bulk solution; for the latter type encapsulation happens if the supersaturation profiles of the core and coating solutes are staggered in time in order that the core solute precipitates first and the coating solute deposits on it by mass transfer. A model for the process that includes nucleation and growth has been developed to select systems and process conditions that favor encapsulation. The mechanisms have been experimentally verified at 52\u00a0bar and 303\u00a0K for (i) encapsulation of suspended nanoparticles of silica with ascorbylpalmitate (AP) dissolved acetone and (ii) encapsulation of in situ produced tartaric acid (TA) nanoparticles with AP, both initially dissolved in acetone.

A rapid pressure reduction over a CO2-expanded organic solution, from 30\u201370 to 1\u00a0bar at 303\u00a0K decreases the solution temperature by 30\u201380\u00a0K in a very short span of time (0.5\u20131.5\u00a0min), which generates a rapid, high, and uniform supersaturation of the dissolved solute in the solution and facilitates precipitation of ultrafine particles. The model developed in this work estimates the supersaturation attained, nucleation and growth rates obtained during the pressure reduction over CO2-expanded organic solutions, and the particle size distribution of the precipitated particles. Cholesterol has been chosen as a model solute to be precipitated, and acetone has been chosen as a solvent. A new method has been developed for prediction of equilibrium solubility of solute which is affected by a decrease in CO2 mole fraction as well as a simultaneous decrease in solution temperature during pressure reduction. This method combines the semi-empirical approach of using the partial molar volume fraction of solvent in a CO2-solvent binary mixture and solid\u2013liquid equilibrium data for a solute\u2013solvent system. Size distributions of the precipitated particles have been calculated assuming primary nucleation (homogeneous as well as heterogeneous nucleation) and diffusion-limited growth kinetics. The predicted mean average particle sizes are then compared with the size of cholesterol particles precipitated by pressure reduction of a CO2-expanded acetone solution of cholesterol. The particle sizes predicted assuming heterogeneous nucleation are found to be closer to the experimentally observed particle sizes, indicating that the heterogeneous nucleation could be the main mechanism of nucleation, which could occur at the gas\u2013liquid interface of the CO2 bubbling out of CO2-expanded solution during pressure reduction.",

     "abstract": "The tunable solvent properties of gas expanded liquids (GXLs) have been previously used for the fractionation and separation of polydispersed ligand-stabilized metal nanoparticles into distinct monodispersed fractions. This work employs CO2 expanded hexane for silver nanoparticle synthesis within an AOT reverse micelle system where the tunable GXL solvent properties are used to control the nanoparticle size and polydispersity. The objective of this project is to answer two questions: (1) can nanoparticles with narrow and well-defined size distributions be synthesized in GXLs? and (2) how do the solvent properties impact the resulting nanoparticle size? In the reverse micelle synthesis, the AOT surfactant provides a nano-scale aqueous micelle core for nanoparticle nucleation, as well as, acts as a nanoparticle stabilizing ligand. Increasing the CO2 partial pressure in a GXL impacts the surfactant\u2013solvent interaction and results in the synthesis of different sized nanoparticles. At ambient pressures, the mean particle diameter synthesized was 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0nm with W\u00a0=\u00a040 and 5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0nm with W\u00a0=\u00a020, where W is the molar ratio of water to AOT. At CO2 partial pressures of 6.9 and 13.8\u00a0bar, there was no significant change in particle size, but decreases in the size distributions were observed. At CO2 partial pressures ranging from 20.7 to 41.4\u00a0bar, steady decreases in the mean particle diameter and size distribution were observed with values of 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 for W\u00a0=\u00a040 and 4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 for W\u00a0=\u00a020 at 41.4\u00a0bar. This demonstrates some degree of nanoparticle size tunability within the GXL solvent, where smaller particle diameters and size distributions are achieved at higher CO2 compositions.",

     "abstract": "A SrRuO3 deposition process using supercritical fluid deposition (SCFD) was designed for fabricating electrodes in ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM). To make stoichiometric SrRuO3 film (Sr:Ru\u00a0=\u00a01:1), deposition rates of component materials, SrO and RuO2, must be balanced, and thus, we investigated the deposition kinetics of the component materials. The deposition rate of SrO was found to be less than that of RuO2 in all cases, and SrO particle generation during deposition was problematic. Both of these issues could be overcome by controlling the temperature and O2 concentration. For SrRuO3 deposition, the Sr-/Ru- precursor concentration ratio was the dominant factor to control the composition of the film. Stoichiometric SrRuO3 film can be formed by increasing the Sr-/Ru- precursor sconcentration ratio to 6. Our deposited film satisfied three major requirements for a FeRAM electrode: perovskite crystal structure, low resistivity, and conformal deposition onto the trenches (aspect ratio of 5).",

It is suggested, that subcritical conditions significantly enhance the characteristics of a desalination solution through the decrease of viscosity, density and surface tension, thus resulting in improved diffusion constants of the anionic exchange of chloride and hydroxide ions. In addition, long-term stability appears to be enhanced by transformation of corrosion products into more stable forms.",

     "abstract": "Archeological artifacts such as burial and embalmment materials are commonly dated by 14C labeling using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The presence of contaminant organic matter can interfere with the accurate determination of an object's age, hence sample preparation is a critical step before radiocarbon-based dating. Both harsh acid and base treatments have been applied to remove contamination, such as humic acids, resin-based adhesives, and plant oils. Additional removal of carbon-laden material can also be affected by applying such methods as plasma oxidation. In this study, SC-CO2 with addition of a cosolvent has been applied to remove the above materials prior to plasma oxidation and subsequent dating via AMS. Initially, wood/charcoal samples were extracted using a modified-Isco SFX-2-10 extraction unit (Isco Inc., Lincoln, NE). Experiments were conducted using supercritical carbon dioxide/10% methanol at a pressure of 20.4\u00a0MPa (3000\u00a0psig) (pr\u00a0=\u00a02.80) and 40\u00a0\u00b0C (Tr\u00a0=\u00a01.36), and carbon dioxide flow rates of \u223c1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0ml/min. Comparison of the SC-CO2\u2013methanol cosolvent treatment with traditional acid\u2013base\u2013acid sample pretreatment on identical wood-charcoal samples showed comparable radiocarbon dating results encompassing a period of 10,000 years. In addition, both Russian and Egyptian mummy gauzes and Russian textiles were similarly treated and the extracts analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and GC/MS to determine the chemical identity of the extracted material. A polyglycerol-based polymer was positively identified in addition to fatty acid moieties as their fatty acid methyl ester derivatives (FAMES), which potentially formed from the in situ reaction of the triglycerides present in the embalment materials with the SC-fluid mixture. Model extractions from spiked-linen gauze samples have verified removal of such materials as beeswax, coconut oil, frankincense, glycerol, and humic acids in varying amounts. Application of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) appears to be a promising method to pretreat small samples for 14C radiocarbon dating where conservation of the archeological artifact is of importance. The SFE pretreatment has the potential to replace harsh acid\u2013base pretreatment methods, and can be coupled with a non-destructive argon or oxygen plasma treatment for microgram carbon removal prior to accelerator MS isotope ratio age determination of the archeological artifact. This combination of techniques requires as little as 0.05\u00a0mg of carbon-equivalent weight for the age determination of the artifact while minimizing sample degradation.",

It is found that the cobalt on the spiked sample can be totally removed in a pilot unit. The influence of the carbon dioxide flow rate, the flow rate of the extractant solution, the ratio of D2EHPA to hexane in the extractant solution, the temperature and the replacement of hexane by methanol are investigated in this study. Upon extraction, the cobalt complex with D2EHPA is precipitated with the extractant solution in a separation tank through depressurization, and the amount of extracted cobalt in the separation tank is sampled and analyzed by ICP-OES. The accumulation of the removed cobalt along the extraction time is plotted as an extraction curve, and a kinetic model is established to predict the extraction. It is found that the kinetic model reasonably fits the experimental data. From the model, it is concluded that the metal extraction depends on reactivity, that the extent of the extraction is determined by the reversible reaction of the ion-exchange between D2EHPA and the cobalt ions and that the adsorption kinetics of the extractant in the environment of supercritical carbon dioxide may play an important role in the initial stage of extraction. The proposed model, which successfully provides an easy and accurate prediction for metal extraction from a porous solid matrix, can help to reveal the extraction mechanism and optimize the operational conditions for future scale-up designs.",

     "abstract": "The use of supercritical CO2 as solvent for separation processes and chemical reactions is widespread. Many industrial extraction processes using CO2 consume a huge amount of energy and hence are very cost-intensive. In the past, the duration of extraction was often longer than required for an optimum result. Therefore, an inline monitoring device for terminating CO2 extraction processes at the right time has been desirable. In collaboration between KIT and SITEC-Sieber Engineering, Switzerland, a mobile near infrared (NIR) inline monitoring device has been developed to close this gap and to offer an opportunity to implement it into industrial extractions processes using CO2 and to use the data for process optimization. NIR spectroscopy with fiber optics adaption has been proven to be a very good choice, because the CO2 bands are well separated from all other bands of interest caused by the extracts (organics and water). The NIR inline monitoring device can easily be implemented into industrial plants to visualize the extraction progress and to terminate the process at the right time in order to save energy and money. Measurements on customer's demand are available for extraction and reaction processes in supercritical CO2.This paper will actually focus on two applications. Firstly, in collaboration with NATECO2, Germany, the NIR inline monitoring device has been implemented into a plant for hops extraction with supercritical CO2. Extractions have been performed and successfully monitored for the varieties Hallertauer Magnum, Hallertauer Herkules, and French Strisselspalter at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0MPa, 28\u00a0MPa, and 50\u00a0MPa, respectively. The detectability was 0.1\u00a0wt% of hops in CO2.Secondly, the applicability of this NIR inline monitoring method on processes for the production of submicron particles in supercritical CO2 has been demonstrated in a feasibility study. For this purpose, a RESS (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solution) high pressure plant (160\u00a0ml, max. 35\u00a0MPa, max. 120\u00a0\u00b0C) was built and the NIR inline monitoring device integrated. Two syringe pumps were coupled for an almost pulsation-free-feeding. Benzoic acid was used as a reference solid. In this feasibility study, the focus has not been to perform an optimized RESS process, but rather to monitor the loading of the CO2 phase with benzoic acid continuously, as this information is crucial for the optimization of a RESS process and has not been available up to the present. The experiments have been carried out at 55\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0MPa as reference conditions. The performed calibration resulted in a detection limit of 0.1 mg benzoic acid per g CO2. The loading of the CO2 phase has been successfully and continuously monitored and can now be applied for other systems.A side effect of these investigations has been the finding that this NIR inline monitoring device can also be used for very precise solubility measurements and to visualize the establishment of thermodynamic phase equilibrium as a function of time, especially in cases of low solubility of a substance in CO2. The NIR inline monitoring device can also be used for the inline monitoring of reactions producing data for kinetic modeling and process optimization.",

     "abstract": "This work demonstrates that supercritical carbon dioxide extraction is efficient for the complete recovery of neutral lipids from microalgae with a water content up to 20\u00a0wt%, allowing thus a further full characterization of this oil. This is a first useful step in the framework of lipid production from microalgae either for nutraceutical, food or for energy applications. This study is particularly focused on the influence of the pretreatments upon extraction kinetics and yields. This study proposes a complete study at laboratory scale (10\u00a0g per batch of dry biomass) of the influence of pretreatments (type of drying and grinding) and of water content on the extraction kinetics and yields as well as on the oil composition in terms of lipidic classes and profiles. Two drying pretreatments (drying under air flow and freeze-drying) applied on Nannochloropsis oculata were studied. Extraction experiments were carried out at 40\u00a0MPa, 333\u00a0K, with a carbon dioxide flow rate of 0.5\u00a0kg\u00a0h\u22121 and for different granulometries. Results showed that drying under air flow at 308\u00a0K is the most adequate pretreatment leading to the most rapid kinetics. Whatever the pretreatment used, the extracted oil contains more than 90\u00a0wt% of triglycerides and does not contain phospholipids. As expected, the smaller the particle size, the faster the extraction kinetics. Finally, an increase in the biomass water content up to 20\u00a0wt% increases the global extraction kinetics (extraction of both water and oil) but appears to have no influence on oil extraction yields. Moreover, the extraction of neutral lipids happens to be complete for a CO2/charge mass ratio ranging from 30 to 130 depending on the operating conditions and on the characteristics of the treated biomass. Finally, pilot scale experiments were performed with batches up to 15\u00a0kg in order to evaluate the influence of pressure and particle size on the extraction kinetics and yields. Extracts obtained at 333\u00a0K with operating pressures of 50\u00a0MPa and 85\u00a0MPa have similar compositions and do not contain phospholipids.",

In order to establish optimized operating conditions, supercritical extraction of Usnea as well as sorption kinetics and resulting material properties have been studied separately first. Usnea extracts isolated by supercritical carbon dioxide at 30\u00a0MPa and 40\u00a0\u00b0C have shown strong antibacterial activity with values of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from less than 1.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL to 320\u00a0\u03bcg/mL against Listeria innocua and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) strains.

     "abstract": "The aim of this work was to investigate the properties of polyethylenes (PE) of various densities (low-density and high-density) under pressure of CO2 and propane. The phase equilibria of PE of different density in presence of CO2 and in presence of propane in dependence of pressure and temperature were investigated. The phase transitions of PE at atmospheric pressure were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Furthermore, phase transitions of polymers under pressure of gases were measured by using an optical high pressure cell. Measurements of phase transition were performed in range of pressure of 1\u201390\u00a0MPa. The results show that melting points of LDPE decreased in presence of CO2 and in presence of propane. For high-density polyethylene (HDPE) the melting point decrease was observed only in presence of propane, while in presence of CO2 melting point increases with increasing pressure. The melting points of LDPE and HDPE decrease in average for 10\u201320\u00a0K in presence of propane, while in presence of CO2 the melting point decrease for both LDPE was lower (5\u201310\u00a0K). Solubility and diffusivity of supercritical CO2 in two low-density polyethylenes (LDPE) and in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were measured at temperature 373\u00a0K and pressures up to 30\u00a0MPa using a magnetic suspension balance (MSB). The solubility data were used for estimating the binary diffusion coefficients. The solubilities increased with increasing density. The diffusion coefficient shows strong CO2 density and CO2 solubility dependence. Diffusion coefficient starts to decrease with increasing density and solubility of CO2.",

They have potential application in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry, as well as for agriculture and crop protection. Supercritical fluid fractionation is an interesting technology for the selective removal of monoterpenes (MT) and the purification or enrichment of the more bioactive oxygenated terpenes (OT), resulting in more effective, stable and water soluble products. In this work, the fractionation of Tagetes minuta and Salvia officinalis essential oils with carbon dioxide is experimentally studied in a semicontinuous apparatus at 313\u00a0K and 80\u00a0bar. Successive extracts are collected and the composition determined by gas chromatography. Process behavior is modeled with the group contribution equation of state (GC-EOS), showing a good agreement between model predictions and experimental results. The GC-EOS model is applied to the simulation and analysis of two continuous fractionation schemes: a simple countercurrent column and a countercurrent column with external reflux. The influence of operation variables (temperature, pressure, solvent-to-feed ratio, thermal gradient, reflux ratio) is studied in order to maximize OT concentration and recovery in the raffinate and to minimize carbon dioxide consumption. Experimental and simulation results are discussed in terms of the relative volatilities between MT and OT fractions. Particularly in the case of S. officinalis, the presence of several OT of intermediate volatility and a significant amount of higher molecular weight sesquiterpenes (ST) limits the separation performance, even when external reflux is applied.",

It was found that the solubility of CO2 in the PP/MicroCaCO3 composites without the interface compatibilizer increased with increasing the filler content, while the CO2 solubility remained almost unchanged in PP composites with compatibilizer. The Henry's law and a modified Henry's law were used to well correlate the solubility of CO2 in the PP composites with and without the interface compatibilizer, respectively. The diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the PP composites was found to decrease with increasing the filler content. The mutual diffusion coefficients of CO2 in the PP composites can be correlated within an average relative deviation of 10% by the free volume model proposed by Kulkarni and Stern with a parameter accounting for the barrier effect of the filler.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study is to model the solubilities of solid aromatic compounds in supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) using feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN). Temperature, pressure, critical properties and acentric factor of each solute have been used as independent variables of ANN model. The parameters of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network have been adjusted by back propagation learning algorithm using experimental data which have been collected from various literatures. In order to find the optimal topology of the MLP, different networks were trained and examined and the network with minimum absolute average relative deviation percent (AARD%), mean square error (MSE) and suitable regression coefficient (R2) has been selected as an optimal configuration. By this procedure a single hidden layer network composed of nineteen hidden neurons has been found as an optimal topology. Sensitivity error analyses confirmed that the optimal ANN can predict experimental data with an excellent agreement (AARD%\u00a0=\u00a04.99, MSE\u00a0=\u00a07.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 and R2\u00a0=\u00a00.99699). Capability of the proposed ANN model has compared with those published results which have obtained by SAFT combined with eight different mixing rules (one, two and three parameters mixing rules) and PRSV equation of state (EOS). The best presented overall AARD% for SAFT approach with one, two and three parameters mixing rules are 16.15, 12.32% and 7.65%, respectively while PRSV EOS showed AARD% of 21.10%. The results emphasize that the proposed ANN model can predict the solubilities of solid aromatic compounds in SCCO2 more accurate than SAFT and PRSV EOS.",

Experimental and modelling results of supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of lipids from four different microalgae: Nannochloropsis oculata, Cylindrotheca closterium, Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis, are presented. The experimental setup is a laboratory scale apparatus which allows an accurate monitoring of the mass loss of the microalgae sample during the extraction. The experimental data were obtained at a pressure of 40\u00a0MPa, a temperature of 333\u00a0K and CO2 flow rates from 0.3 to 0.5\u00a0kg\u00a0h\u22121. The extraction experiments were performed on samples having undergone different pretreatments: (i) after harvesting and centrifugation, microalgae were dried either by freeze-drying or air flow drying) and (ii) they were ground and sieved at different particle sizes (particle diameters ranging from 160 to 1000\u00a0\u03bcm). The complete extraction of neutral lipids was performed leading to mass losses up to 30% depending on the samples and on the operating conditions. Extracts were mainly composed of triglycerides (more than 90\u00a0wt% of extracts). The mathematical model published in 2005 and the simplified equations of extraction curves (using the characteristic times characterizing each extraction step) published in 2012 by Sovov\u00e1 were chosen to fit the experimental data. Among the hypotheses proposed by Sovov\u00e0, we considered that the flow pattern of supercritical CO2 in the extraction autoclave was plug flow and the extraction process was supposed to occur with negligible solute\u2013matrix interactions. The adjustable parameters were calculated by minimizing the sum of least squares between experimental and calculated values of the extraction yield. Good agreement between the two models and our experimental measurements was obtained. The average absolute relative deviation ranges between 0.5 and 10.2%.",

Studies on the production and characterization of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) particles incorporating or not 17\u03b1-methyltestosterone (MT), a hormone frequently use for the sexual reversion of Nile tilapia raised in large scale in tanks are herein reported. The particles were obtained employing a supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) method, using dichloromethane (DCM) as solvent for the polymer and the hormone and CO2 as the supercritical fluid. The influence of the operating pressure, polymer solution concentration and flow rate on the size and morphology of particles was evaluated, as well as the effects of the incorporation of the hormone at different MT/PLA mass ratios. The results attained showed that the PLA particles presented appropriate DCM concentrations levels (below 600\u00a0ppm) and average diameters between 5.4 and 20.5\u00a0\u03bcm when free of the hormone. The average diameters of the particles containing 17\u03b1-methyltestosterone increased up to 4 times, and MT incorporation efficiencies up to 53% were achieved. A significant decrease was noticed in particle crystallinity (from 26.52 to 1.72%) due to the addition of the hormone to the formulation. X-ray diffraction analysis showed no separate diagrams of each substance as a result from the physical mixture of the polymer with the hormone. The particles obtained had low zeta potential values, what indicates reasonable tendency to agglomerate.

The conventional method led to films heterogeneities with high surface roughness, and the immersion technique evinced several disadvantages like low incorporation yields, and negative influence on water vapor permeability and on the swelling degree of the film. The supercritical method showed that longer contact times and the use of ethanol as a cosolvent increased the natamycin loading yields and led to homogeneous films, where SSI (CO2\u00a0+\u00a0EtOH) process produced visually attractive and tranlucent films.",

While the thermal efficiency increases almost linearly with low side pressure in the sub- and trans-critical cycles, it attains a maximum in the supercritical regime at \u223c85\u00a0bar after which there are diminishing returns on increasing the low side pressure. It is also found that supercritical cycle is capable of producing power with a thermal efficiency of >30% even at a lower source temperature (820\u00a0K) and accounting for foreseeable non-idealities albeit with a higher turbine inlet pressure (\u223c300\u00a0bar) which is not matched by a conventional sub-critical cycle even with a high source temperature of 978\u00a0K. The reasons for lower efficiency than in an ideal cycle are extracted from an irreversibility analysis of components, namely, compressor, regenerator, turbine and gas cooler. Low sensitivity to the source temperature and extremely small volumetric flow rates in the supercritical cycle could offset the drawback of high pressures through a compact system.",

The approach focused on phase equilibria (with a distinctive feature of being modeled by artificial neural network) and 3D-simulation of the mixing (considering both heat and mass transfers) in order to detail the supersaturation profiles in the mixing zone and confronted them to the crystallization results. The effect of pressure was investigated as well.

Simulations results showed that supersaturation levels were low (around 2) and that the expanding jet spread similarly whatever the pressure. The effect of differential temperature on the mixing behavior and supersaturation was investigated. Compared to isothermal cases, higher superaturations were obtained but only if a more concentrated solution allowed by the higher temperature was processed as well. The benefit for the crystal size was difficult to evidence because of the long sizes of the needles and the difficulties of processing almost saturated solutions.

In this study, new global reaction rate parameters for the oxidation of isopropyl alcohol in hydrothermal regime were adjusted from temperature profiles of our group's previous experimental data.

     "abstract": "A novel green method for textile cleaning, based on supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as solvent and an aqueous suspension as co-solvent, is proposed. The co-solvent (which is a calcium oxide suspension in water) is not mixed with the solvent but is impregnating first the textile. The wet textile is then exposed to scCO2 atmosphere. Calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to give calcium carbonate. These particles, which have been deposited on and/or impregnated the soiled textile, stabilize locally carbon dioxide-in-water (C/W, Pickering) emulsions. The soil, depending on its nature (hydrophobic/hydrophilic), is distributed preferably in the favoured phase of the emulsion, and is removed either via a rapid depressurisation or due to solubility. The proposed method has been successfully applied on dyed and non-dyed, cotton and silk textiles that were soiled with soils of different nature. Four different dyes were used. In all cases the extent of soil removal was between 53 and 97%. Characterization of the soiled and cleaned textiles was performed by means of weight loss (soil removal efficiency), colour measurements, optical microscopy, thermogravimetry and tensile testing. The mechanism of the cleaning process was also explored. For this purpose, various experiments were performed including comparative experiments with scCO2, scCO2\u00a0+\u00a0water or isopropanol as co-solvent and scCO2\u00a0+\u00a0SiO2 particles. A mechanism is proposed and its supporting facts are discussed. Our results show that the proposed process can be used for cleaning different textiles soiled with various types of soils such as particulate soils, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, liquid, or solid. It is shown that this cleaning does not affect the existent dyes. Among the advantages of the method is the discontinuous character of the process and the non-requirement of very high pressures, thus minimizing CO2 and energy consumption.",

Silicon sludge is the waste discharged from the silicon ingot cutting process and consists of cutting oil, cooling water, and silicon particles. The oil contained in silicon sludge was removed completely within several minutes by supercritical water elutriation at 400 or 500\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0MPa. The recovery percentage of silicon was only 70% at 400\u00a0\u00b0C owing to silicon dissolution. However, the recovery percentage was greater at a higher temperature (95% at 500\u00a0\u00b0C) because silicon dissolution was suppressed owing to the low ion product of water at higher temperatures. The silicon recovered at 500\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0MPa was approximately 99.2% pure. Contamination by oxidation was negligible because an oxide film did not grow on the silicon surface during the supercritical water treatment. We conclude that high-purity silicon can be recovered efficiently by supercritical water elutriation using a semi-batch reactor and that the methodology is promising for recovery of silicon from silicon sludge.",

In this work the system (propane\u00a0+\u00a0carbon dioxide\u00a0+\u00a0water) has been chosen as a model (light oil fraction\u00a0+\u00a0carbon dioxide\u00a0+\u00a0water) mixture. Phase equilibrium measurements have been carried out using a quasi-static-analytical high-pressure apparatus that was validated on the system (n-decane\u00a0+\u00a0carbon dioxide) in comparison with literature data, and used to study the system (n-decane\u00a0+\u00a0carbon dioxide\u00a0+\u00a0water) [E. Forte, A. Galindo, J. P.M. Trusler, The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 115 (49) (2011) 14591\u201314609]. In the present work, new experimental data have been measured for the system (propane\u00a0+\u00a0carbon dioxide\u00a0+\u00a0water) under conditions of three-phase equilibria. Compositions of the three coexisting phases have been obtained along four isotherms at temperatures from 311 to 353\u00a0K and at pressures up to the upper critical end points where the propane-rich and the carbon dioxide-rich phases become critical. The experimental data obtained for the ternary mixture have been compared to the predictions obtained with the statistical associating fluid theory for potentials of variable range (SAFT-VR). The phase behaviour of each pair of binary subsystems has been calculated using this theory and, where applicable, a modification of the Hudson and McCoubrey combining rules has been used to treat the systems predictively. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the phase behaviour of the ternary mixture has been carried out based on comparison with available data for the constituent binary subsystems, as well as with the previous findings for the ternary (n-decane\u00a0+\u00a0carbon dioxide\u00a0+\u00a0water). Such comparison is useful to examine the effect that adding a third component has in the mutual solubility of each pair. Remarks relevant to reservoir processing are also highlighted.",

     "abstract": "The study of phase equilibria in hydrogen-containing mixtures is essential for petroleum and chemical engineering, electricity production, transportation and for many other energy needs. Fluid-phase diagrams are however atypical because of the size-asymmetric nature of these mixtures and the quantum behavior of hydrogen. Therefore, the development of a thermodynamic model able to accurately predict the phase behavior of such systems over wide ranges of pressure and temperature is a difficult and challenging task. In this work, the H2 group is added to the well-established PPR78 model in order to predict mutual solubility and critical loci of hydrogen-containing systems. Such a model combines the widely used Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state (EoS) with a group-contribution method aimed at estimating the temperature-dependent binary interaction parameters [kij(T)]. In our previous papers, 15 groups were defined: CH3, CH2, CH, C, CH4 (methane), C2H6 (ethane), CHaro, Caro, Cfusedaromaticrings, CH2,cyclic, CHcyclic\u00a0\u21d4\u00a0Ccyclic, CO2, N2, H2S, and SH. It was thus possible to estimate the kij for any mixture containing alkanes, aromatics, naphthenes, CO2, N2, H2S and mercaptans regardless of the temperature. In this study, the addition of the H2 group makes it possible to extend the PPR78 model to hydrogen-containing systems.",

In this regards, five binary systems at the temperature and pressure ranges of 263.15\u2013393.15\u00a0K at 0.18\u201312.06\u00a0MPa were used to examine the feasibility of cascade-forward back-propagation ANN model. In this regard, the collected experimental data were divided in to two different subsets namely training and testing subsets. The training subset was selected in a way that covers all the ranges of the experimental data and operating conditions. Then, the accuracy of the proposed ANN model was evaluated through a test data set not used in the training stage. The optimal configuration of the proposed model was obtained based on the error analysis including minimum average absolute relative deviation percent (AARD %) and the appropriate (close to one) correlation coefficient (R2) of test data set. The obtained results show that the optimum neural network architecture was able to predict the phase envelope of binary system containing CO2 with an acceptable level of accuracy of AARD % of 2.66 and R2 of 0.9950 within their experimental uncertainty. In addition, comparisons were done between the Peng\u2013Robinson (PR) equation of state (EOS) and ANN model for three different binary systems including CO2\u00a0+\u00a01-hexene, CO2\u00a0+\u00a0n-Hexane, and CO2\u00a0+\u00a0n-butane.

The focus of the present work is on a numerical model (ANSYS FLUENT\u00ae) simulating flow and temperature fields of supercritical water jets discharged in a subcritical water bath at near-critical pressures. However, the used turbulence model tended to overestimate the values of the turbulent thermal conductivity near the pseudo-critical point of water.

Additional experiments were performed in a high-pressure vessel to record axial temperature profiles of the supercritical water jet and validate the numerical model.",

Supercritical drying has long been known to be a method by which the structure of RF aerogels has the greatest chance of being perfectly preserved. Although several investigations have been conducted into the effects of the applied drying parameters on the final gels, the structural evolution of the gels during the drying process is nevertheless poorly known. In this work we present an in situ small angle X-ray scattering study of (1) the changes that occur in the structure of RF networks during supercritical drying under various conditions, and (2) the kinetics of the drying process.During the pressurization stage the overall structure of the network remains unaffected by the rate of increase of the CO2 pressure. By contrast, depressurization with supercritical CO2 at rates in excess of 4\u00a0bar/min, or with liquid CO2 alone, causes bubbles to form and yields a shrunken state of the final network. This densification preferentially shrinks the larger pores, the smaller pores being much less affected. We find that liquid CO2 is also an efficient drying medium that can preserve the structure, but the depressurization stage must always start from the supercritical state. The incomparable advantage of supercritical CO2, however, is that its higher rate of molecular diffusion makes solvent exchange substantially faster than with liquid CO2.",

     "abstract": "Supercritical antisolvent fractionation (SAF) was evaluated in the fractionation and concentration of a family of beneficial plant compounds called lignans from the ethanol extract of flaxseed. The amount of lignans obtained in different fractions was studied under varying pressures (10\u201330\u00a0MPa), CO2 flow rates (5\u201315\u00a0kg\u00a0h\u22121) and times of treatment (60\u2013180\u00a0min) in a three-stage fractionation column with constant temperature fixed at 313, 323 and 333\u00a0K. The determination of lignan content was performed by HPLC coupled with a coulometric array detector. The effects of each individual variable as well as their interactions were investigated using a full factorial design with three factors and two levels and the optimal conditions were calculated through response surface methodology. A statistically significant increase in lignan content was obtained after the SAF process; from an average initial lignan content of 1.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121 it was possible to obtain a total lignan content ranging from 3.42 to 12.96\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121. We conclude that SAF is an appropriate technique for the isolation of lignans from flaxseed.",

     "abstract": "A novel concept of clean diesel combustion using supercritical fluids is proposed and being investigated to address some key challenges encountered in the fuel and transportation sector. The core of this concept is to inject diesel fuel (DF) in the supercritical state to achieve clean, high-efficiency combustion in diesel engines. Among other challenging issues that must be addressed for the implementation of this new concept is the thermal stability of DF and the potential decomposition and solid deposit formation under engine conditions. In this work, thermal stability of DF was experimentally evaluated under subcritical and supercritical conditions in both static (batch system) and dynamic (continuous flow system) thermal stressing systems. The effects of thermal stressing temperature (200\u2013440\u00a0\u00b0C) and duration (10\u2013600\u00a0min) and CO2 concentration (\u223c10\u00a0wt%) were examined. DF decomposition is characterized by the average absolute deviation (AAD) of GC peak area percentages of all individual components. A temperature\u2013time window (400\u2013420\u00a0\u00b0C, 0\u201360\u00a0min) where supercritical DF combustion in diesel engines may be possible was determined. CO2 as a diluent could prevent or reduce accumulation of solid deposits inside fuel pipes mainly due to an increased solubilization capacity of DF. Finally, different structures and morphologies of solid deposits observed under different batch thermal stressing conditions were discussed.",

Juc\u00e1 fruits were subjected to supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) using CO2 at 25\u00a0MPa and 50\u00a0\u00b0C and the resulting extract was later incorporated into the above referred wound dressings by a supercritical fluid impregnation/deposition method (SSI). GC analysis revealed that the obtained SFE extract is particularly rich in unsaturated (52%) and saturated (26%) fatty acids as well as in terpenoids (13%) such as lupenone and gamma-sitosterol. Extract loading yields depended on the affinity of the hydrophobic extract for the specifically employed wound dressing material and was almost 2-fold greater for CBC than for the other two commercial wound dressings. The prepared extract-loaded dressings were cytocompatible with RAW 264.7 macrophages (viability\u00a0>\u00a085% at 24\u00a0h) and down-regulated the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b1 pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as the production of nitric oxide, which confirms the anti-inflammatory capacity of the employed juc\u00e1 extract. Nevertheless, such effect was somehow counteracted by a pro-inflammatory activity that was exhibited by CBC.

The effect of five operating conditions on particle morphology, mass median diameter (Dp50) and HCPT loading is investigated using the single-factor method. The results indicate that HCPT loading can be greatly increased by using DCM/EtOH co-solvent, and the suitable operating conditions for the experimental system are determined. Under suitable conditions, the HCPT loading is 13.3% and Dp50 is 794.5\u00a0nm. The drug loaded microparticles are characterized in detail. The SEM images showed that most of the particles were spherical, and PLLA concentration has a major impact on the particle shape. Results of TEM, DSC and XRD indicate that the micronized HCPT is dispersed into the PLLA matrix. For low HCPT loading, most of HCPT existed in the drug loaded microparticles in an amorphous state, but for high HCPT loading, part of the encapsulated drug existed in crystalline form. FT-IR results show that SAS process does not change the chemical structure of HCPT.

With increasing chain length the GE stabilizes to around 50% at the conditions chosen. From gas and liquid phase product analysis decomposition schemes were proposed for the short chain compounds.A remarkable oscillatory behaviour of the methane and CO2 product yield with increasing chain length of the acids and alcohols was found experimentally.

ScCO2 was firstly employed to sweep PET melt, i.e., high pressure CO2 continuously flows through the vessel at a fixed flow rate to remove small molecules for higher molecular weight PET, then this modified PET melt was directly foamed through a rapid depressurization process using scCO2 as blowing agent. In this integrated process, PET with high melt strength after polycondensation modification could be foamed directly in molten state. Therefore, re-molten process of solid modified PET pellets was canceled to avoid its degradation and CO2 saturation time could be saved in foaming process, thus processing time could be shortened and energy efficiency could be improved. The influences of scCO2 sweeping treatment time, pressure and flow rate on properties of the modified PETs and cell morphologies of the foamed PETs were investigated respectively. The results showed that CO2 sweeping treatment could effectively enhance PET melt polycondensation modification process, which was superior to that of N2 treatment.

SFE curves were modeled using well-known mathematical models from literature, and mass transfer coefficients were determined and validated through correlations with dimensionless numbers. The process cost for industrial application was also estimated. The extracts were evaluated in terms total carotenoid content, carotenoid profile, astaxanthin yield and UV\u2013Vis scanning spectrometry. The results indicated that shrimp waste can be used for concentrating natural carotenoids. The SFE was favorable at 13.3\u00a0g/min of CO2 flow rate and at 11.210% of raw material moisture content. The Sovov\u00e1 [21] model best fitted in the experimental data and indicated higher influence of convection when compared to diffusion. In addition, the results from the dimensionless number correlations indicated that forced convection is more important than natural convection. The carotenoid extraction increases with enhancing the CO2 density. The highest astaxanthin yield was obtained by CO2 at 300\u00a0bar/333.15\u00a0K.

Hydrothermal gasification of glucose was performed in the absence and presence of catalyst (K2CO3) in a batch reactor. The influences of temperature and pressure in the supercritical regimes of water, catalyst were examined in relation to the yield and composition of the gases and aqueous products. The product gases were analyzed by gas chromatography, and the aqueous products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The gases produced were carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and C2\u2013C4 hydrocarbons and there was significant production of aqueous products and residue. The aqueous products composed of oxygenated compounds, including carboxylic acids (glycolic acid, formic acid, acetic acid), furfurals (furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, 5-methyl furfural), phenols (phenol, methyl phenols, hydroxy phenols, methoxy phenols), aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, propionaldehyde), ketones (3-methyl-2-cyclo-pentene-1-one, 2-cyclo-pentene-1-one) and their alkylated derivatives. Carbon gasification efficiencies were improved by addition of K2CO3 into the reacting system. Carbon gasification efficiency reached maximum (94%) at 600\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00a0MPa. The yield of hydrogen among gaseous products increased with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure.",

POSS nanocages, which can be functionalized with a wide variety of organic substituents, are most commonly studied as nanofillers in polymer nanocomposites and coatings. Solubility of trifluoropropyl POSS in supercritical carbon dioxide has been determined by cloud-point measurements performed in a high-pressure view cell. At temperature and pressure ranges of 308\u2013323\u00a0K and 8.3\u201314.8\u00a0MPa, these fluorinated organic\u2013inorganic hybrid nanocage structures exhibit solubility up to 4.4% by weight, which is promising for green material processing applications using the environmentally benign solvent. Solubility of CO2-philic POSS decreases with increasing temperature, while the solubility isotherms at two different temperatures converge. Choosing the processing conditions from the performed solubility studies, trifluoropropyl POSS\u2013supercritical carbon dioxide system has been applied in high-pressure surface modification of a high-molecular weight, rigid poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the processed PMMA sheet show that the functionalized nanoparticles were deposited on the PMMA surface, forming a uniform coating of POSS aggregates. This work proves that functionalized POSS with CO2-philic groups can be solubilized in supercritical CO2, which might allow them to be applied in a plethora of materials modification processes using supercritical carbon dioxide.",

     "abstract": "During the process of making metallic contacts for the electronics industry, they become stained with lubricating oil. Nowadays, the oil is removed by organic solvents. The aim of this work was to investigate their replacement by supercritical CO2, promoting a greener solution. The contacts stained with 3% lubricating oil were placed forming a fixed bed. The CO2 at different temperatures, pressures and mass flow rates was made to continuously flowing over this. The oil removal rates and yields were monitored and compared. As the pressure was increased between 120 and 300\u00a0bar, the oil extraction rate and consequently the yield also increased because of the CO2 density increment. But, the existence of a chemisorbed oil layer on the surface of the contact was demonstrated, probably formed by the paraffinic heavy fractions and some additives, and this was difficult to remove. The rise in temperature (37\u2013110\u00a0\u00b0C) helped with the detachment of this layer, because of the endothermic character of the desorption. The viscosity of the oil also decreased. The increase in flow rate (1\u20137\u00a0g\u00a0min\u22121) helped to sweep away the desorbed oil. However, within the explored variables and independently of the contact composition, it was impossible to achieve total lubricant elimination. Therefore, the addition of a cosolvent, ethanol, was explored. The lower the temperature was, the larger amounts of ethanol were needed. Thus, total lubricating oil elimination was achieved at 110\u00a0\u00b0C with the addition of 5% ethanol. These results were confirmed by electronic microscopy images.",

The effects of mixing tee geometry and flow rates on the properties of the synthesized LiFePO4, including particle size, surface area, crystalline structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance, were examined. It was found that, when the flow rate increased, the particle size decreased; however, the discharge capacity of the particles synthesized at the high flow rate was lower due to the enhanced formation of Fe3+ impurities. The use of a swirling tee led to smaller-sized LiFePO4 particles with fewer impurities.

It was found that temperature increasing leads to less-ordered structure, particle agglomeration increasing, average crystal size increasing, specific surface decreasing, micropore volume decreasing and mesopore and macropore volumes increasing that corresponds with each other and correlates with the results of kinetic experiments. It was shown that reaction rate and conversion degree is given not only by temperature factor but also by product structural properties, which influence on the diffusion of water to the surface of reactive aluminum. It was shown an important role of flow reaction system in the providing of high rate of hydrothermal oxidation of aluminum and its conversion degree. The results of analysis of structural properties of boehmite confirmed in general that hydrothermal oxidation of aluminum is a promising method of the production of catalyst carriers and sorbents. It was established the possibility to assign the structural properties of nanocrystalline product by thermodynamic parameters within the experimental reactor. The results of mass spectrometric analysis showed that total impurity concentration in produced boehmite decreases in comparison with initial aluminum powder.",

The cross-disproportionation of formaldehyde with formic acids to methanol and carbonic acid was also observed especially in the presence of an excess of formic acid. It was experimentally shown that methanol is a relative stabile molecule up to 270\u00a0\u00b0C and its presence in the reaction medium does not influence the cross-disproportionation and formic acid decomposition. In the experimental part, the rate of the HCHO consumption was found to be 27.9 (L/mol)0.5\u00a0s\u22121 exp(\u221258.5\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121/RT) [HCHO]1.5. In fact the reaction of formaldehyde is very complex system of consecutive and parallel reactions. Some of these reactions are of major and some of minor importance in the range of reaction conditions. Concentrating of the major reaction steps, the reaction was described by a simple model consisting of only two reaction steps. The Arrhenius factors and the activation energy of these two main reaction steps are determined by fitting. Such a simple model describes the reaction of formaldehyde reasonable well in the temperature range up to 270\u00a0\u00b0C. At 300\u00a0\u00b0C, for a good description additional reactions steps in the model would be necessary.",

A sensor based on the calorimetric measurement principle and the according experimental methods were developed to determine heat transfer coefficients of subcritical and supercritical water jets. In the subcritical temperature range the results show good agreement with existing empirical correlations originally developed for isothermal, subcritical, liquid jets. An interesting behavior was though observed for supercritical injection temperatures: when the impinged surface is still at subcritical temperatures, the peak of the water's specific heat at the pseudo-critical temperature dominates the heat transfer even at injection temperatures far beyond the pseudo-critical temperature.",

The conventional method of producing methyl methacrylate had the disadvantages of dealing with very toxic raw material and producing large amounts of waste. A new and more environmental friendly route for producing methyl methacrylate involves carbon monoxide. Therefore, it is of significance to have accurate knowledge of the phase equilibria for mixtures of carbon monoxide and methyl methacrylate. In this study, we have determined the high-pressure vapour\u2013liquid equilibria of this binary mixture within a temperature range of 313\u2013318\u00a0K and pressures up to 12\u00a0MPa.

The results indicate that the solubility of CO in methyl methacrylate has an \u201cinverse\u201d temperature-dependence in which larger amounts of gas can dissolve in the liquid as temperature is increased at a fixed pressure. A comparison to carbon dioxide solubility in the same liquid shows that CO dissolved much less than CO2 in methyl methacrylate.

     "abstract": "Optofluidic components enable flexible routing and transformations of light beams in integrated lab-on-a-chip systems with the use of carefully shaped fluid parcels. For structural integrity reasons, the working fluid is typically contained within a solid-material chip. One of the outstanding challenges in optofluidics is the preparation and processing of optofluidic waveguides. These require solid cladding materials that are sufficiently strong to contain the fluid while possessing optical properties that allow efficient confinement of light within fluidic channels. Here, we report on a new technique to obtain liquid-core optofluidic waveguides based on total internal reflection of light in three-dimensional water-filled channels embedded in hydrophobic silica aerogel. To form the channels, we employ a fiber made of cage-like silicon-oxygen compound \u2013 trifluoropropyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (trifluoropropyl POSS) \u2013 which has high solubility in supercritical CO2 (scCO2). A U-shaped fiber made of trifluoropropyl POSS is obtained by melt/freeze processing of POSS powder and subsequently placed in a silicate sol. After gelation of the sol and aging of the gel, scCO2 extraction is used to dry the wet gel and extract the POSS fiber, yielding a dry silica aerogel with a U-shaped empty channel inside it. Finally, the silanol groups at the surface of the aerogel are reacted with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) in the presence of scCO2 to render the aerogel surface hydrophobic and the channel is filled with water. We demonstrate efficient waveguiding by coupling light into the water-filled channel and monitoring the channel output. The presented procedure opens up new possibilities for creating complex three-dimensional networks of liquid channels in aerogels for optofluidic applications.",

     "abstract": "In this work, the solubilities of ferrocene and acetylferrocene in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) were measured using an analytical method in a quasi-flow apparatus. High-performance liquid chromatography was applied through an online sampling procedure to determine the concentration of ferrocene and acetylferrocene in the scCO2 phase. The experiments were performed within a temperature range of 308\u2013348\u00a0K and at pressures ranging from 7.7 to 24.4\u00a0MPa. Acetylferrocene is the product of the Friedel\u2013Crafts acylation reaction of ferrocene and has many applications in the material and pharmaceutical industries. The molar solubilities at the applied conditions range from 8.9 to 31.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 for ferrocene and 2.5 to 79.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 for acetylferrocene. The existence of a cross-over area for acetylferrocene was detected at a pressure of around 15\u00a0MPa and for ferrocene at a pressure of around 10\u00a0MPa. The comparison between the experimental solubility data shows that ferrocene is more soluble in scCO2 at lower pressures, while at higher pressures acetylferrocene is more soluble in scCO2. The reason for this behavior is a trade-off between the lower polarity of ferrocene (more dominant at lower pressures) and the higher volatility of acetylferrocene (more dominant at higher pressures). Results obtained in this work show that the solubility of the reaction product acetylferrocene in scCO2 is sufficiently high to use scCO2 extraction at high pressures to separate it from its reactant ferrocene in Friedel\u2013Crafts acylation processes.",

In this study, advantage of high pressure processing and supercritical fluid extraction with carbon dioxide in isolation of active principles from lichen Usnea barbata L. was presented. Supercritical extraction showed extremely higher selectivity toward usnic acid compared to the conventional techniques tested.

Supercritical extract obtained at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 30\u00a0MPa showed stronger antibacterial activity against the most of tested strains compared to pure usnic acid and extracts obtained using ethanol as a solvent. Further, supercritical extract with lower usnic acid content expressed stronger antibacterial activity against the majority of tested strains including MRSA strains compared to the pure usnic acid and the supercritical extract with the higher usnic acid content. The same extract was far more effective than ampicillin against Streptococcus uberis, all tested Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA and MRSA ATCC 33591. Against few tested strains, the supercritical extract was superior to erythromycin and penicillin as well. These findings justified possible benefits of inclusion of supercritical extracts into pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations.

Based on previous works, water extraction at 200\u00a0\u00b0C was selected to achieve the maximum antioxidant activity while water flow rate was studied to determine its influence on powder formation. Other parameters influencing the drying process, such as scCO2 pressure (80\u00a0bar) and flow rate (2.5\u00a0mL/min) and N2 flow rate (0.6\u00a0mL/min) were settled to obtain a fine and constant spray.

In this case first, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technique was trained with the recorded data from kinetic experiments at pressures of 8, 10, 14 and 18\u00a0MPa and constant temperature of 303.15\u00a0K. The performance of this proposed model was validated with experimental data and excellent predictions with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0235 were observed.In the next step of study, mass transfer coefficient in terms of Sherwood number was estimated by a neuro-fuzzy network. The estimated mass transfer coefficient was embedded in mathematical model. The proposed gray box (hybrid) model was validated with the experimental data and RMSE of 0.0523 proved that equipping mathematical model with neuro-fuzzy network has significantly improved performance of the model. Then, neuro-fuzzy and gray box models were compared with previously published artificial neural network and mathematical models. It was found that ANFIS model has the best performance compared to all modeling techniques.Finally, extrapolation ability of ANFIS, white box, and gray box models were studied. The mass of extracted was predicted up to 300\u00a0min (beyond the training range). It was observed that again ANFIS model is the best model for extrapolation purposes.",

Extractions were carried out at different pressure, temperature and flow rate to analyze the influence of these variables on the extraction kinetics and the oil quality obtained. Extraction curves are initially linear with a slope close to the oil solubility value in supercritical CO2. Based on these results a mathematical model was successfully applied to describe the extraction curves. Characterization of supercritical crude corn oil was performed by determining some physical parameters such as refraction index, density and color. Additionally, the fatty acid composition, neutral lipids, the content of tocopherols, acid index, peroxide value, antioxidant capacity and the oxidative stability were determined in the corn oil extracted. Fatty acid composition was compared with that for crude germ oil and no significant differences between the oils extracted by both methods were found. Oxidative stability test using the Rancimat showed that supercritical CO2 extracted corn oil is less protected against oxidation than n-hexane extracted oils.",

The phase behavior of CCl4 in water during heating at 34.1\u2013260.0\u00a0\u00b0C was observed by a microscope, and images were recorded with a digital camera. The phase phenomena showed that the CCl4 gasified between 231.3 and 260.0\u00a0\u00b0C during the heating process. The hydrolysis was monitored by tracking the in situ vapor-phase Raman signals for CCl4 and product CO2. Increases in the CO2 Raman peak area over time were correlated to the hydrolysis yield. The quenched liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and ion chromatography, and the results indicated that the only hydrolysis products were HCl and CO2.

The CCl4 hydrolysis in the FSCR was found to be mainly a vapor phase reaction. Temperature was the prime determining factor for the hydrolysis rate. The CCl4 hydrolysis rate was also dependent on the initial concentration of vapor-phase CCl4 and the initial CCl4(l):H2O(l) volume ratio.

For the conversion without addition of \u3008Zn\u3009 and \u3008Al\u3009 the yield of volatile and liquid products was 3.1 and 47.3%, respectively, in relation to the weight of bitumen. As a result of a chemical interaction of H2O molecules with bitumen, oxygen atoms appeared in these products and conversion residue; the amount of hydrogen in them being increased. When \u3008Zn\u3009 or \u3008Al\u3009 was added, the conversion and hydrogenation of bitumen significantly increased owing to hydrogen evolution during the oxidation of metals by SCW. This oxidation via the synthesis of ZnO and Al2O3 nanoparticles was accompanied by on-site heating of reactants. Moreover, when adding \u3008Zn\u3009 and \u3008Al\u3009 into bitumen, the yield of the volatile products increased up to 15.3 and 38.2%, respectively.

By introducing Ca(NO3)2 to the reactor inlet and Ca(OH)2 to the reactor outlet, 94% of the carbon and 95% of the reactive nitrogen in acrylonitrile (C3H3N) were simultaneously converted to solid CaCO3 and innocuous nitrogen gas at 250\u00a0bar and 420\u00a0\u00b0C.

Furthermore, CaCO3 with average particle size of 1.72\u00a0\u03bcm can either be used for industrial applications or reconverted to Ca(NO3)2, which can be recycled to the reactor, and carbon dioxide, which can be injected into deep geological formations.

     "abstract": "Several industrial wastes that are either insoluble in water at room temperature, very concentrated or very dilute are difficult to treat by supercritical water oxidation (SCWO). This limitation leads to different operating problems related to pumping, preheating and thermal control during their treatment. A new feed system that is described here avoids the aforementioned problems and is suitable to treat water-insoluble organics and wastewaters with a wide range of concentrations. The new feed system has been tested in a pilot plant that includes three independent feed streams: (1) a preheated aqueous feed stream that contains water or a dilute wastewater, (2) a non-preheated feed stream containing the water-insoluble waste (i.e., oil waste) or the highly concentrated wastewater and (3) an air stream used as a source of oxygen. Once the aqueous feed stream in the supercritical state was mixed with the water-insoluble waste, a supercritical homogeneous phase was obtained and the oxidant was subsequently added so that the oxidation reactions took place at a high rate and released a significant amount of heat. Appropriate control of these feed streams with this technological solution would extend the versatility of the SCWO process in respect of the concentration of residues to be treated (normally limited to between 5 and 20% organic matter), since it allows the combined treatment of dilute residues (<5%) in the aqueous feed and very concentrated residues (close to 100%) in the water-insoluble feed. The optimum concentration in the reactor can thus be controlled, making it possible for the plant to remain self-sufficient in energy or to generate surplus energy, and to maintain the pilot plant operation under safe conditions by simply adjusting the flow rate of the water-insoluble stream.The work described here concerns the best procedure and operating conditions to mix the three aforementioned streams (water\u2013oil\u2013air) leading to safe and efficient performance of a highly exothermal process.",

This study is an extension of our previous work on the mixing of a single-component hydrocarbon droplet in SCW. The current study provides microscale information, such as multi-component partitioning, and insight into large scale mixing in applications that include supercritical water oxidation, supercritical water desulfurization, etc. Transport, thermodynamics, and phase equilibrium sub-models are used to estimate the relevant physical properties. Results show that fractionation, i.e., the preferred dissolution of a specific hydrocarbon component into the water-rich phase, characterizes the transport and mixing process at various water temperatures. We find that the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) for binary water\u2013HC mixtures control the mixing or fractionation of ternary water\u2013HC\u2013HC mixtures. Fractionation is: modest at water temperatures less than the water\u2013toluene binary UCST (which is the lower UCST); substantial at water temperatures greater than the water\u2013toluene binary UCST but less than the water\u2013decane binary UCST (which is the higher UCST); and negligible at water temperatures greater than the ternary UCST. At water temperatures when fractionation is noticeable, the less water-soluble hydrocarbon (e.g., decane) composition in the droplet may increase over time and the water fraction in the droplet may go through a maximum, as more of the more water-soluble hydrocarbon (e.g., toluene) diffuses into the water-rich phase than the less water-soluble hydrocarbon. Varying the initial toluene concentration can either increase or decrease the droplet radius depending on the water temperature relative to the UCSTs.",

The microparticles obtained showed a lower degree of crystallinity compared to the untreated materials, as confirmed by XRPD and DSC analyses. The G2 branched 1:8 PEG:PLA copolymer, because of the structure and the size of the obtained particles, can be considered the most promising for the controlled release of a drug.",

In this work, micronization of PEG6000 and PEG10000 is proposed using Supercritical Assisted Atomization process operating in the new arrangement working at reduced pressure, specifically developed to process thermosensitive compounds. This process improvement allows to apply precipitation temperatures as low as 5\u00a0\u00b0C. When PEG6000 was processed, through the reduction of the precipitation temperature down to 5\u00a0\u00b0C, particles tended to collapse; but, when PEG10000 was processed at the same operating conditions, spherical not aggregated microparticles were obtained with mean diameters ranging between 2 and 3.3\u00a0\u03bcm and characterized by sharp particle size distribution. X-ray powder diffraction analysis showed that SAA processed PEG had the same crystalline structure of the unprocessed material.",

It was used in our rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS) experiments with supercritical carbon dioxide as the solvent. Effects of four process parameters on the particle formation of ethosuximide were investigated. These parameters include the extraction pressure (Pext), orifice nozzle diameter (Dn), pre-expansion temperature (Tpre) and post-expansion temperature (Tpost). It is observed that an operation at a higher extraction pressure, lower post-expansion temperature and smaller orifice nozzle diameter is favorable for the production of smaller ethosuximide particles while the effect of pre-expansion temperature is insignificant. This API was micronized from its original mean size of 175.5\u00a0\u03bcm to the smallest average size of 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm at the optimal RESS process conditions. A polymorph conversion of ethosuximide was observed after the RESS process by physical properties characterization using the X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Measurements of the dissolution profiles for ethosuximide before and after the RESS process were also conducted.

A pressure range up to 35\u00a0MPa was investigated. It is shown that melting temperature of PCL initially increases from 64\u00a0\u00b0C to 67\u00a0\u00b0C then decreases and passes through a minimum at around 10\u00a0MPa before leveling off at about 44\u00a0\u00b0C with increasing CO2 pressure.

Molecular weight determinations by GPC on samples that were exposed to and melted in CO2 showed that no degradation was occurring during melting in CO2. These findings show that melt processing of PHB and PHBV which are prone to thermal degradation upon melting in ambient atmosphere is achievable without causing degradation in CO2 medium.

The preparation of natural product-based nanoporous materials is regarded as an upgraded process that fulfills the above requirements. The drying of covalently crosslinked protein-based hydrogels using supercritical carbon dioxide is a promising technology for generating highly porous matrices in the dry form (aerogels) susceptible to loading with high active compound contents. In this work, whey protein aerogels and cryogels were prepared by supercritical drying (SCD) and freeze drying (FD) techniques, respectively, from thermally induced protein hydrogels processed at various pH values (1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 7.0, 8.0 and 10.0). A comparative study of the properties of the resulting whey protein aerogels and cryogels was carried out. Mechanical stability as well as microstructural and textural properties of the resulting dried gels was shown to be influenced by the pH value of the hydrogel and the drying technique used. Aerogels were mesoporous (pore diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a027.4\u00a0nm) whereas cryogels showed macroporosity (pore diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a0200\u00a0\u03bcm).

Whey protein aerogels showed a high drug loading capacity of up to 9.5% (w/w) (cryogels: 0.4\u20130.8%, w/w), pH-dependent swelling behaviour in aqueous media and a sustained diffusive drug release.",

     "abstract": "Although it has been known that many of the enzymes may be instable in harsh conditions of supercritical CO2, recent experimental studies argued that the enzymes are active and stable in near-critical propane with same pressure and temperature condition. But there are no clear reasons at the molecular level for the activity and stability of the enzymes in such condition. Moreover, it is difficult to experimentally monitor the microstructure and dynamics of the enzyme in a supercritical fluid in situ. In this study the enzyme microenvironment in near-critical propane is investigated using molecular dynamic simulation. For comparison with other solvent models the enzyme was also simulated in water, hexane and supercritical CO2. We examined the overall structural properties of Candida antarctica lipase B in these four solvents and found that in supercritical CO2 there are high structural deviations from native form while in near-critical propane deviations are low and very close to those of in the mild aqueous solution and even are lower than those of in hexane. \u03b1-Helix and \u03b2-sheet contents of the enzyme remain intact in near-critical propane. These theoretical results are in agreement with experimental evidences of the stability and activity of the enzyme in near-critical propane. Moreover, it was found that the activity of the enzyme in near-critical propane can be related to the water partitioning on the surface of the enzyme. The results of this study not only confirm the reported experimental findings about enzyme stability and activity in near-critical propane, but also shed light on the structural situation of the enzyme in this condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular dynamic simulation of a protein in a non-CO2-based compressed gas.",

An important finding is that long-range attractive surface forces are detected not just near the critical point, but along the supercritical extension of the coexistence line, which is commonly discussed as the supercritical ridge.Using a precisely adjustable model slit pore, our experiment can measure the change of thermodynamic potential together with changes in refractive index (mass density) in the confined CO2. The model slit pore is realized between two atomically smooth mica surfaces in a specially designed high-pressure surface forces apparatus. Our data suggest that thermal fluctuations of higher density are selectively depleted, which results in observation of a time- and space-averaged density reduction in the confined film. Direct observation of this confinement effect has consequences for theoretical understanding as well as technological applications of CO2 in porous materials.In the presence of small amounts of an acrylate solute (polyethyleneglycol-dimethacrylate), we found that multiple stable menisci of solute can be created between the surfaces and stretched out several micrometers. These liquid-liquid bridges are observed as an apparent birefringence effect. We demonstrate the critical character of the phenomena and discuss our findings in terms of a (super)critical Casimir effect.",

In each experiment, a solution of prednisolone in methanol was expanded using carbon dioxide as the anti-solvent. A synthetic method was used for measuring bubble point curves, and the solid (prednisolone)\u2013liquid boundaries. Three-phase equilibrium data of solid (prednisolone)\u2013liquid\u2013vapor were obtained from the intersection of the two-phase isopleths vapor\u2013liquid and solid\u2013liquid.

However, at higher concentrations, carbon dioxide acts as an anti-solvent, thus precipitation temperature increases with increasing carbon dioxide concentration. Also, it is shown that at a proper temperature, it is possible to precipitate most of the dissolved solute with small changes in pressure.",

Manufacturing cost of the extraction was estimated, and an optimal extraction time was observed by the end of the convective period. Finally, the extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography, and over 20% of the oil was composed by PUFA, whose concentration increased with extraction time.

For that purpose, SFE is performed in two steps. In the first step, the most volatile compounds from hop essential oil are isolated by extracting pellets T90 applying a carbon dioxide density of 0.29\u00a0g/mL (90\u00a0atm, 50\u00a0\u00b0C). Subsequent fractionation of the crude extract from this first SFE step via solid phase extraction (SPE) using octadecylsilica and ethanol/water mixtures, results in flavour-active single variety hop oil essence, highly enriched in \u2018floral\u2019 compounds of total hop essential oil. When added to a non-aromatised pilot lager, such varietal essences impart pleasant and pronounced floral, hoppy and citrus scents to the beer flavour. In the second step of the SFE procedure, the hop residue from the first extraction step is further extracted using a carbon dioxide density of 0.50\u00a0g/mL (110\u00a0atm, 50\u00a0\u00b0C). As a result of the typical construction of the collection vials and further fractionation of the crude SFE extract via SPE, single variety hop oil essence, highly enriched in oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (\u2018spicy\u2019 compounds), is obtained. When added in appropriate amounts to a non-aromatised pilot lager, such \u2018spicy\u2019 essences impart revealing sensory impressions, i.e. pleasant herbal/hoppy aroma, and in particular, increased bitterness intensity, mouthfeel, and fullness.",

Near the critical pressure, the dehydration and decarboxylation rates decreased with increasing pressure. The apparent activation volumes near the critical pressure were high where the isothermal compressibility of water was large, implying that formic acid attracts water molecules better than the transition state does, and that the partial molar volume of the transition state is larger than those of the reactants. At higher pressures, dehydration rate increased with increasing pressure. Comparisons with experimental results for HCl addition at constant pressure suggest that dehydration proceeds via an ionic reaction at high pressures. The pressure may affect formic acid decomposition in supercritical water negatively through solvation effects near the critical pressure, and positively through ionic reactions above 30\u00a0MPa.",

Effects of operating conditions on the extraction yield and on the degree of deacetylation (DD), molecular weight (MW), and polydispersity (PD) of the extract were investigated.

The extraction yield was increased by increasing density of scCO2. The extract had lower MW and PD but higher DD than the untreated chitosan. The DD data revealed that in chitosan the amount of the amino groups (NH2) other than the carbonyl (CO) in the residual acetyl groups (CH3CO) governed the extraction process. The DD, MW, and PD of the extract were higher as extracted by scCO2 (+1\u00a0wt% AC solution) of higher densities. By tuning density of scCO2 in the presence of AC via controls of temperature and pressure, chitosan could be fractionated by the method established here.",

Silver membrane filters of 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm pore size were used to collect particles under supercritical conditions. Thermal resistance monitoring on the test section showed asymptotic, linear fouling and deposition-removal cycles. A novel method for qualitatively determining the strength of the oxide to the tube surface using a combination of ultrasonic and acid wash procedures demonstrated that at supercritical conditions, a stronger bond is formed which is speculated to be caused by the precipitation of dissolved ferrous species. A comparison between different conditions of pH, heat flux, and precursor were examined using the experimental techniques which are presented in this study. It was found that multiple techniques are needed to characterize the fouling process if the underlying rate-limiting steps are not known a priori.",

It is shown that in carbon dioxide the melting temperature of Piroxicam is reduced by 17\u00a0\u00b0C, from 200\u00a0\u00b0C to 183\u00a0\u00b0C.

Piroxicam that was melted and recrystallized in carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide\u00a0+\u00a0co-solvent mixtures displayed distinct differences in its infrared spectra, thermal behavior and X-ray diffraction patterns as compared to its unprocessed form. Melting in CO2 and CO2\u00a0+\u00a0co-solvent mixtures was found to lead to a polymorphic transformation of Piroxicam from the \u03b2 crystal form (cubic) to the \u03b1 crystal form (needle). It was further found that melting of Piroxicam in 90:10\u00a0wt% CO2:ethanol fluid mixture promotes inclusion complex formation with \u03b2-cyclodextrin leading to a 1:1 molar ratio complex.

The optimum processing conditions, which include: menthol concentration, temperature and processing time, were determined by experimental design to produce crystalline and a desired particle size. The average particle size of spray-dried amorphous lactose decreased from 8.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28\u00a0\u03bcm to 7.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0\u03bcm after conditioning with modified CO2 at 150\u00a0bar and 50\u00a0\u00b0C for a period of 5\u00a0h. The SEM results shows that these particles kept their micro-spherical shape, however, the particle surface became rough due to crystallisation.

The partitioning coefficient of ibuprofen PMMA and CO2 was high, whereas the diffusivity of ibuprofen was found to be order of magnitudes lower than that of CO2. These two effects are believed to result in high drug loading in the polymer. It was also concluded that CO2 helped in producing uniform concentration profiles of ibuprofen in the PMMA films. Finally, preliminary studies on the impregnation of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), PVP, with ibuprofen were performed. The QCM response in the case of PVP films was significantly larger than that with PMMA at the same conditions. Some possible causes for this unusual behavior are discussed.",

The results are compared with those obtained by Soxhlet with dichloromethane, and the influence of the operating conditions upon the global yield and the individual yields of the triterpenic acids is discussed in detail. The acetylated TT acids imparted a large effect on the extraction yields, as they appeared in large concentrations on the extracts independently of their absolute loadings in the bark. The polarity of the free acids, higher than that of their acetyl derivatives, justifies this behavior. Modeling calculations were also performed for interpreting the SFE results. The experimental observations are in agreement with predictions accomplished for the solubilities and mass transfer fluxes of ursolic acid and 3-acetylursolic acid that were chosen as key TT acids in the process.",

The model equation correlates the ternary solubilities of seven pharmaceutical solid mixtures along with current data with an average AARD around 9.5% and sixteen non-pharmaceutical solid mixtures with 9% AARD.",

     "abstract": "The solubility of palladium hexafluoroacetylacetonate [Pd(hfac)2] and nickel hexafluoroacetylacetonate dihydrate [Ni(hfac)2\u00b72H2O] in supercritical CO2 (scCO2) has been measured using a high-pressure variable volume view cell. At 313.2\u00a0K and 8.9\u00a0MPa, the solubility of Pd(hfac)2 is above 3.6\u00a0wt% (3.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 mole fraction). Solubility measurements of Ni(hfac)2\u00b72H2O were also carried out at 313.2, 323.2 and 333.2\u00a0K in the 9.4\u201325.1\u00a0MPa pressure range. Ni(hfac)2\u00b72H2O mole fraction solubility values vary from 2.95\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 to 2.02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124. For a given temperature, the solubility increases with pressure due to the higher density of the solvent. At constant pressure, however, a crossover has been observed. At mole fractions below ca. 1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124, solubility decreases with temperature due to the decrease in density of the fluid. On the contrary, at higher concentrations, solubility increases with temperature due to the increase in the solute vapour pressure. Ni(hfac)2\u00b72H2O solubility data were satisfactorily correlated to semi-empirical equations. The solubility of Ni(hfac)2\u00b72H2O in scCO2 was more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than the solubility of Pd(hfac)2 at similar conditions. This is related to the presence of water molecules bound to Ni in the precursor which allow the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and may cause the formation of a molecules network. Adding a small amount of a polar modifier such as ethanol (2\u20136.5\u00a0mol%) to scCO2 increased substantially the solubility of the precursor. At EtOH concentrations close to 5\u00a0mol%, the solubilisation pressures were rather independent of the Ni(hfac)2\u00b72H2O concentration in the 1\u20136\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 mole fraction range. The large solubility increase observed in scCO2 modified with EtOH may be related to the rupture of the hydrogen bonded Ni(hfac)2\u00b72H2O network due to the better solvation of the complex in the CO2/EtOH mixture possibly by hydrogen bonding between Ni(hfac)2\u00b72H2O and EtOH.",

In order to evaluate the high-pressure method in terms of process yield, extract composition and biological activity, low-pressure methods, such as maceration with ethanol (Mac), Soxhlet (Sox) with different organic solvents, and hydrodistillation (HD), were also applied to obtain extracts. The SFE conditions were temperatures of 313.15\u00a0K, 323.15\u00a0K and 333.15\u00a0K and pressures from 10 to 30\u00a0MPa. The SFE kinetics was investigated through the overall extraction curve (OEC). The extracts obtained by Sox with water and ethanol showed the best results for the global extraction yield. The best conditions in the studied range to obtain high yields using pure CO2 resulted to be 30.0\u00a0MPa and 323.15\u00a0K. The antioxidant potential of the extracts was evaluated by the DPPH method and by the Folin\u2013Ciocalteau method. Maceration extract presented low yield, but good results of antioxidant activity by DPPH assays and total phenolic. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was also studied.

The heat flux ranges from 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122 to 1.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122, the fluid inlet Reynolds number ranges from 3.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 to 2.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104, and the pressure ranges from 5.5\u00a0MPa to 10\u00a0MPa. The results show that for supercritical R22, the frictional pressure drop increases significantly with the heat flux. At p\u00a0=\u00a05.5\u00a0MPa, Rein\u00a0=\u00a012,000 and a heat flux of 106\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122, the local heat transfer is greatly reduced due to the low density fluid near the high temperature wall. Both buoyancy and flow acceleration have little effect on the heat transfer. For supercritical ethanol, the frictional pressure drop variation with the heat flux is insignificant, while the local heat transfer coefficient increases as the enthalpy increases. Ethanol gives better flow and heat transfer performance than R22 at supercritical pressures from 7.3\u00a0MPa to 10\u00a0MPa for heat fluxes of 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u20131.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122.",

Experiments were conducted at 255\u2013270\u00a0bar in a continuous set-up, with temperatures ranging from 375 to 700\u00a0\u00b0C, a feed concentration of 10\u00a0wt%, and a residence time of 8\u201387\u00a0s. The catalysts promoted the decomposition of glycerol significantly. At 674\u00a0\u00b0C the conversion of glycerol without catalyst was approximately 40%, while in the presence of catalysts (almost) complete conversion was obtained. All catalysts promoted the water-gas shift reaction, while the ones based on Ni also promoted methanation. Visual coke formation was significant for Ni/ZrO2 and Pt/CeZrO2, which might be responsible for the observed reduction in activity at longer runtimes for these two catalysts. The specific surface area of all catalysts, apart from CuZn, decreased after contact with water at supercritical conditions.

The simulations in a two-dimensional domain have been performed using the low-Reynolds k\u2013\u03f5 turbulence model, and the IAPWS-IF97 formulation to describe the properties of water at different conditions.The accuracy of the model is validated using an experimental setup at supercritical pressures. The experimental dataset was obtained in supercritical water flowing upward in a 0.4\u00a0m long vertical bare tube with 10\u00a0mm ID. The temperature data were collected at multiple heights in the tube and at pressures of about 24\u00a0MPa, an inlet temperature of 300\u00a0\u00b0C, values of mass flux ranged from 6.6 to 10\u00a0kg/m2\u00a0s and an outer wall temperature of 300\u00a0\u00b0C resulting in bulk-fluid temperatures exceeding the pseudo-critical temperature. The comparison of the temperature results shows a good agreement for low mass fluxes between the experimental and numerical data. At these low flow conditions, the 2D model predicts recirculation zones near the inlet which results in a more complex simulation. The accuracy of the 2D model for higher fluxes cannot be properly assessed on basis of the experimental data because of practical limitation of the setup. But the accuracy of the 2D model for the higher mass flow cases is expected to be even more accurate, due to less complexity in the flow calculation because of smaller buoyancy effects.Finally simulation results of the two-dimensional model at higher mass flows are compared with several frequently used one-dimensional correlations from literature for heat transfer at supercritical pressures.",

In this study, PCL\u2013gelatin blends were explored as a less sensitive yet more bioactive electrospun scaffold allowing the use of increased pressures and temperatures. The presence of the gelatin renders these electrospun fibers far less sensitive to supercritical CO2 exposure.

ATR observations suggest that these exposures increase the mobility of the amorphous content. In cases where XRD shows no crystalline content peaks prior to CO2 treatment, post-exposure crystalline regions are detected.

     "abstract": "The adsorption of Palladium hexafluoroacetylacetonate [Pd(hfac)2] dissolved in supercritical CO2 (scCO2) onto mesoporous silica SBA-15 has been studied by measuring the adsorption isotherms. At 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 8.5\u00a0MPa, the adsorption increases up to saturation at ca. 0.55\u00a0mol Pd(hfac)2/kg SiO2 SBA-15. The influence of temperature, pressure and density of CO2 on the adsorption equilibrium has been also examined. At constant temperatures of 40 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C, the amount adsorbed on the support decreases as pressure and density increase. At 8.5\u00a0MPa, the amount adsorbed increases as the temperature increases from 40 to 80\u00a0\u00b0C. At CO2 constant density (350\u00a0kg/m3), adsorption decreases as the temperature increased from 40 to 80\u00a0\u00b0C. For the assayed conditions, the maximum adsorption was achieved at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and 8.5\u00a0MPa. Data were successfully correlated to the Langmuir, modified Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. Adsorption of Pd(hfac)2 on silica SBA-15 seems to be weak and it is mainly dominated by the large solubility of Pd(hfac)2 in the supercritical fluid. Impregnated samples were reduced in pure H2 at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 6.0\u00a0MPa and their catalytic activity was evaluated for the hydrogenation of isophorone in supercritical CO2. Adsorption data were used to control the load of Pd in the catalyst and to tune the catalytic activity of these materials. Catalytic tests showed the importance of choosing the right impregnation conditions.",

The methodology is essentially based on supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of total hop essential oil using carbon dioxide of appropriate density, followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) using octadecylsilica and ethanol/water mixtures for preparation of polar hop essence. Different SFE temperature\u2013pressure combinations were tested for extraction of total hop essential oil from pellets. A carbon dioxide density of 0.50\u00a0g/mL (50\u00a0\u00b0C, 110\u00a0atm), proved to be the best compromise in view of selective and quantitative extraction of total hop essential oils. Further fractionation of total hop essential oil by SPE in order to remove hydrocarbons, resulted in varietal polar hop essence, highly enriched in water-soluble, oxygenated hop oil constituents. All of the applied procedures of the proposed SFE/SPE methodology are in full accordance with the principles of clean-label technology. As a result, the novel hop aroma products are fully compatible with the beer matrix. When added to beer, the novel hop oil preparations impart a typical, varietal dependant pleasant hoppy character and increase beer bitterness and mouthfeel.",

Stagnant carbon dioxide (CO2) or stagnant ethane above their critical points contacted stagnant pellets. Then, a quick depressurization step vented the gases, and the pellets were analyzed for volatiles content. Moderately high temperatures (60\u00a0\u00b0C) appear to be necessary for an effective devolatilization. At 36\u00a0\u00b0C, diffusion limitations dominate, and the extraction performance is insensitive to the pressure and to the chemical nature of the supercritical fluid. At 60\u00a0\u00b0C, ethane could extract more volatiles than CO2, indicating that the mutual solubility of VOCs and extraction fluids is an important factor. Up to a 90% reduction of the initial volatile content resulted after a 3-h contact with CO2 in multiple extractions in which pure CO2 periodically replaced VOC-laden CO2. A similar VOC reduction level resulted using ethane in a single extraction (i.e., without replacing the used ethane).",

All-atom molecular dynamic simulation of three systems composed of enzyme, ionic liquid, and CO2 molecules was performed in 313\u00a0K and 100\u00a0bar. Percentages of ILs in the solvent phase are about 50, 10, and 0% (v/v) in systems 1\u20133, respectively. Simulation clearly showed that enzyme and ionic liquid molecules form a supramolecular-like structure in supercritical CO2. Ionic liquid molecules function as a coating layer and protect enzyme from denaturing condition in supercritical CO2. By analysis of root mean square deviation it was found that the enzyme has more native and stable conformation in supercritical CO2/ionic liquid system than in supercritical CO2. This result is in agreement with experimental observations about the stability of the enzyme in supercritical CO2/ionic liquid system. Moreover, based on the radius of gyration values, it is concluded that enzyme has a more compact and active conformation in supercritical CO2/ionic liquid system than supercritical CO2. Root mean square fluctuations of enzyme flexible residues including \u03b15 and \u03b110 helixes are highly reduced by adding ionic liquid molecules to supercritical CO2. Although \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet content of the enzyme in supercritical CO2 reduced to some extent, they almost remained unchanged in supercritical CO2/ionic liquid. At the molecular level, the results of this research reasonably confirmed that the use of ionic liquid molecules is an efficient method for stabilizing enzymes in supercritical CO2.",

For the cutting process, carbon dioxide is compressed to up to 1600\u00a0bar and expanded via a sapphire nozzle. A pressure chamber is installed downstream the orifice to keep the post-expansion conditions above the triple-point pressure of carbon dioxide. To use the advantages of a thermodynamically stable, liquid cutting jet, carbon dioxide has to be expanded to an environment of increased pressure. By applying this procedure, single-phase \u2018liquid\u2019 or two-phase \u2018liquid/gaseous\u2019 jets can be generated. We show that it is generally possible to cut different materials with these jets. While a carbon dioxide jet does not show any effect on different material samples under atmospheric pressure, the impact increases dramatically using an elevated pressure downstream the nozzle. Different materials, such as wood, aluminium, and polycarbonate could be perforated with liquid CO2. It could be observed that the pre-expansion pressure shows a significant influence on the cutting results. The impact of the jet can be improved by increasing the liquid fraction, for example. Furthermore, the observations suggest that a carbon dioxide jet allows to process materials more precisely and more gently than a high pressure water jet does.",

The high solubility of CO2 in thermoplastic polymers is advantageous to infuse the catalyst precursor, Pd(hfa)2, to polypropylene (PP), however, the hydrophobic nature of PP makes the electroless plating reaction difficult. The hydrophobicity hinders the diffusion of the aqueous plating solution in the polymer, consequently resulting in a weak adhesion of the metal layer to the substrate.

In this regards, the solubility of sulindac with IUPAC name of {(1Z)-5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-[4-(methylsulfinyl)benzylidene]-1H-indene-3-yl}acetic acid were examined in the wide ranges of temperature and pressure of 308.15\u2013338.15\u00a0K and 160\u2013400\u00a0bar, respectively, in supercritical carbon dioxide.

It seems that, at least in the dense regions, there are no upper and lower density limitations in the applicability of the model for different hydrocarbon systems. Having the temperature dependence of the parameters of new EoS, the parameters can be determined at any temperature for each of 38 studied compounds, including short- and long-chain alkanes ranging from CH4 to n-C40H82, and also several cycloalkanes, highly branched alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. The calculated parameters have been used to calculate the density and other derived thermodynamic properties of different hydrocarbons at any temperature and pressure.

The relative chemical shift of the protons in the hydroxyl group was used to describe the degree of hydrogen bonding in ethanol. The dependence of the results on pressure is only weak. The quantification of hydrogen bonding was based on the assumption that the observed shift results from a superposition of the shifts of ethanol molecules differing in the way they are hydrogen bonded. Three different types were distinguished: monomer, donor and acceptor. The monomer shift was found from an extrapolation of the NMR data. Molecular dynamics simulations based on force fields from the literature were carried out for the same mixtures at the same conditions and were used to determine the distribution of differently hydrogen bonded ethanol species. Geometric cluster criteria from the literature were used for identifying the hydrogen bonding and the different types of ethanol species. Using the species distribution from the molecular simulations together with the NMR spectroscopic data, the two state independent numbers for the shifts of the hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor molecules were found. Even though only these two parameters are fitted the large set of experimental data is very well described. This confirms our earlier observations on the CO2\u2013methanol system that molecular models of the simple Lennard\u2013Jones plus point charge type as they are used here can describe both thermodynamic properties and the structural effects of hydrogen bonding in solutions.",

As expected, higher scCO2 densities led to higher cardoon oil yields similar to the Soxhlet one. Two biodiesel synthesis reactions were performed to convert oil esters into fatty acid methyl esters: alkali-based transesterification and acid esterification followed by alkali-based transesterification. All the obtained biodiesel samples were chemically and physically characterized.

The extracts obtained were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) with simultaneous detection by electronic microcapture (\u03bc-ECD) and nitrogen-phosphorus detectors (NPD), coupled in parallel. It was found that the most suitable conditions for the SFE of pesticides under study were 15\u00a0MPa, 318\u00a0K and 4 static stages of 10\u00a0min, with values of % R above 70% for most pesticides.

     "abstract": "Heat transfer in water at supercritical pressures has been investigated numerically using a one-dimensional modeling approach. A 1D plug flow model has been developed in order to make fast predictions of the bulk-fluid temperature in a tubular flow. The chosen geometry is a vertical tube with an inner diameter of 10\u00a0mm and a heated length of 4.0\u00a0m.The simulations concern a heated upward flow with an imposed wall temperature profile. Viscous effects, internal conduction and enthalpy changes due to a pressure gradient have been neglected after evaluation of the governing equations in dimensionless form. The resulting set of equations is closed using Nusselt correlations found in literature and solved using an explicit Euler scheme to simulate heat transfer in a supercritical water flow.The results for three different cases show that the model is able to accurately predict the bulk temperature based on heat transfer rates provided by a suitable Nusselt correlation. However, there is also reason to assume that these correlations are very specific for the flow conditions, since boiling effects occurring at certain conditions can highly influence the heat transfer rate. As a consequence, the model may be unable to describe supercritical heat transfer over a broad range of configurations when only using one correlation. The agreement of these results with the two-dimensional simulations will be investigated in a separate article.The description of the model is preceded by a mathematical description of supercritical water flows and by an overview of the supercritical heat transfer phenomena as observed in earlier studies.",

A real-fluid computational fluid dynamic model has been developed considering all of the relevant fluid property variations (including bulk viscosity) near the critical and pseudo-critical states. The predicted results provide interesting details regarding the thermal transport mechanisms at near-critical and pseudo-critical state fluids. As a layer of supercritical fluid (near the critical or the pseudo-critical states) is heated rapidly, the combination of very high thermal compressibilities and vanishingly small thermal diffusivities affect the thermal energy propagation, leading to the formation of acoustic waves as carriers of thermal energy (the so called piston effect). The results show that under the same temperature perturbation at the boundary, the induced acoustic field becomes stronger as the critical point or the corresponding pseudo-critical state is approached. The heating rate, at which the boundary temperature is raised, is a key factor in the generation of these acoustic waves. We also study the effect of critically diverging bulk viscosity and different rates of boundary heating on the temperature equilibration mechanism near the critical point. An application of the piston effect in near-critical and near-pseudo-critical fluids for effective thermal transport over a long distance is demonstrated for a supercritical heat pipe.",

One of the most attracted areas supercritical fluids are used is extraction. In the present work, the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) process was utilized to activate the deactivated platinum based catalyst regeneration unit with commercial name of R-134. In other words, the aim of the present work was to assess the possibility of R-134 catalyst regeneration using supercritical fluid extraction. In this direction, different parameters influences including, carbon dioxide flow rate (0.06\u20130.70\u00a0cm3/min), extraction static time (45\u2013105\u00a0min), extraction pressure (100\u2013200\u00a0bar) and extraction temperature (313.15\u2013343.15\u00a0K) were investigated. The obtained results show that the optimum parameters were extraction temperature and pressure of 343.15 and 200\u00a0bar respectively, static time of 90\u00a0min and carbon dioxide flow rate of 0.076\u00a0cm3/min to have the highest extraction value.

The 1D droplet model provides microscale information, such as droplet mixing times, that can be used to help understand large scale mixing in applications that include supercritical water oxidation and supercritical water desulfurization. Transport, thermodynamic, and phase equilibrium sub-models are used to estimate relevant physical properties, e.g., diffusion coefficients and fugacities. The upper critical solution temperature (UCST) acts as the controlling parameter in the transport and mixing process as demonstrated by the solutions. When the initial water temperature is below the UCST, complete miscibility defined as the dissolution of the interface can be never achieved. The droplet initially swells due to thermal expansion and net diffusion of water into it, but starts to shrink when it becomes water saturated. A sudden increase of miscibility and mixing rate is observed as the interface temperature increases from below to above the UCST point for the water\u2013toluene system. The mixing rate increases noticeably with increasing water temperature until instant miscibility occurs, after which much slower increase is observed.",

A General Model was developed in this work that considered the solubility of the vegetable oil in CO2 under a reference condition (8.07\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0oil/CO2 at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 30\u00a0MPa), a density-correction depending on k, and an absolute-temperature-correction depending on \u0394H, and best-fit values were estimated using 235 data points from fifteen studies in literature involving eleven different vegetable substrates. The model was validated with many additional data points from seventeen additional vegetable substrates from twenty-one extra studies. The General Model is capable of predicting the solubility of vegetable oils in high-pressure CO2 to within \u00b140% of the experimental values.

We designed a 23 factorial experiment to investigate and identify the relative significance of the operating parameters on the surface morphology and mean size of MTX particles. The effect of the nonsolvent/solvent (acetone/dimethyl sulfoxide, v/v) ratio was found to exert a dominant influence on mean particle size. Increasing the nonsolvent/solvent ratio decreased the particle size significantly. Under the following conditions: nonsolvent/solvent ratio 6:1, MTX concentration 0.3%, flow rate 1.0\u00a0ml\u00a0min\u22121, temperature 308\u00a0K, and pressure 12\u00a0Mpa, the resulting MTX nanoparticles exhibit a good spherical shape, a smooth surface, and a narrow particle size distribution, with a mean particle size of 81\u00a0nm. After supercritical processing, there was no change in the chemical composition of the MTX. However, the physical state of the MTX shifted from crystalline into amorphous due to the minor structural changes which occurred on a molecular level. Due to the reduced particle size and change of physical state, the solubility and dissolution rate of the MTX nanoparticles were much higher than those of the original MTX powder (5.9\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 versus 3.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 in 42\u00a0h, and 12.6\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 versus 10.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 in 92\u00a0h).

Vapour\u2013liquid equilibrium measurements of the system (CO2\u00a0+\u00a0O2\u00a0+\u00a0limonene) were performed at 328\u00a0K and 8, 10, 10.7 and 11\u00a0MPa. In an attempt to establish a relation between vapour\u2013liquid equilibrium data and the kinetics of limonene oxidation, different reactions were performed at 328\u00a0K and at different CO2 total pressures of 9.3\u00a0MPa, 10\u00a0MPa and 10.3\u00a0MPa (with the reaction mixture being biphasic) and at 12.2\u00a0MPa (in a single supercritical phase). The volumetric concentration of O2 in the liquid phase increased as CO2 was added to the system, although this behaviour was only observed close to the critical region. Kinetics of oxidation reactions performed at biphasic conditions, suggests that is the volumetric concentration of O2 in the liquid phase that is controlling the reaction rates.",

Quantitative Structure\u2013Property Relations (QSPR) based on the Conductor-like Screening Model-Segment Activity Coefficient (COSMO-SAC) and the artificial neural network (ANN) were implemented to predict the infinite dilution activity coefficient using a database of 1567 points. The infinite dilution activity coefficients were used to determine the binary interaction parameters of the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state. This thermodynamic model was applied to the whole interval of concentrations of binary mixtures, and the results were compared to experimental data reported in the literature. The applicability of the predictive method is demonstrated for binary systems, involving supercritical CO2 or CHF3\u00a0+\u00a0ionic liquids. Furthermore, the parameterization allows extrapolations in temperature. This study shows that the neural network model predicts well, with a mean square error value of 0.056, while the PC-SAFT model predicts the phase equilibria of binary systems with deviations ranging from 5 up to 70%. The prediction was more reliable at pressures lower than 150\u00a0bar.",

No three-phase regions were observed and at constant composition, an increase in temperature leads to an increase in phase transition pressure. An increase in hydrocarbon backbone length also leads to an increase in phase transition pressure. Comparison of the measured data with literature data of n-alkanes, 1-alcohols, methyl esters and ethyl esters of the same hydrocarbon backbone length shows that carbon dioxide is able to easily distinguish between acids and n-alkanes, methyl esters or ethyl ester and, with selection of the correct conditions, carbon dioxide is also able to distinguish between acids and 1-alcohols. However, unlike for propane, the phase behaviour of an acid in carbon dioxide does not mimic that of an alkane with double the number of carbon atoms, most probably due to the effect of the quadrupole moment of carbon dioxide.",

LSER solute volume (McGowan's volume, V) and solute dipolarity/polarizability (S) greatly affected the partition coefficient values. It was found that the McGowan's volume can be considered as a function of the CO2 solubility parameter, which may be helpful in extending LSER theory to supercritical fluid systems.

     "abstract": "The interfacial tension is a key quantity to phase and interphase behaviour of reservoir systems. Real systems consist of complex mixtures that are not easily accessible to theoretical considerations. By help of experimental analysis, main factors of influence can be determined that may be used for developing theoretical models and thus for obtaining deeper insight into dominating mechanisms. This work focuses on the role of carbon dioxide in gas and liquid mixtures comprising also hydrocarbons such as methane, n-pentane and n-heptane by determining the interfacial tension as a function of pressure in the range of 0.1\u201317\u00a0MPa at 313 and 323\u00a0K, gas composition and time. In the investigated systems, carbon dioxide shows to have a dominating effect caused by its high ability of dissolving in organic liquids and resulting in a strongly decreasing interfacial tension at elevated pressures. A further question addressed in the present work is in which way a changing concentration profile during mass transfer within a pendant drop is associated to the evolution of the interfacial tension. In binary systems, carbon dioxide is known to accumulate at the interface which happens immediately at its formation and covering any other dynamic effect. In ternary vapour\u2013liquid\u2013liquid systems that include water, mass transfer is shown to correlate with the time dependant interfacial tension.",

A separation analysis based on phase equilibrium data (gas loading and selectivity) as well as hydrodynamic experiments (density of the coexisting liquid\u2013gaseous phase and column hydraulic capacity) has been performed in order to optimize the best operation conditions. Process data (solvent and feed flow rates, reflux ratio, and mass fractions in feed and product streams) as well as phase equilibrium data of the multi-compound system fatty acids/carbon dioxide were used to compute the number of stages by the McCabe-Thiele and J\u00e4necke methods.

Simulation of the extraction and fractionation process was conducted using a model based on mass transfer balances to estimate recovery of caffeine as non-polar compound both in CO2 and water phases.

Even though polar compound of chlorogenic acid from coffee beans was extracted in water phase, the simulation was focused on the extraction and fractionation of caffeine because chlorogenic acid was not fractionated but only extracted by water. Effective diffusivity of caffeine in water phase was used as fitting parameter to compare the simulation and experimental results.

A reliable sorption isotherm/isobar model is a requirement, on one hand, for the determination of relevant inner mass transfer coefficients in SC CO2 extractions of vegetable substrates and other biological materials at the laboratory scale, and on the other hand, for a simulation tool successfully applicable to describe industrial SCFE process, which should be based both on a reliable mathematical descriptions of SC CO2 extraction processes. Having a reliable simulation model and model parameters would allow limiting expensive experimental pilot-scale work to validation purposes. Based on simulations of oil extraction from pre-pressed oilseeds using SC CO2 at 353\u00a0K and 90\u00a0MPa, this manuscript shows that the initial oil content in the pre-treated seed affects the apparent solubility of the oil, that the partition of the oil between the seed and CO2 affects oil yield, that it is difficult to discriminate oil partition from inner mass transfer effects, that the best-fit parameters from a mathematical model are adequate only when the model accounts for the true physical picture of the extraction process, and that failure of the mathematical model to account the true physical picture of the extraction process impedes reliable simulations, scale-up, and economical evaluation of industrial SCFE process. Being sorption phenomena of such paramount importance to build a reliable mathematical model for simulation of SCFE processes, this manuscript proposes a mathematical model that fits experimental sorption isotherm/isobars for oil from seeds.",

     "abstract": "In this work, enriching of anti-oxidants has been systematically investigated by supercritical adsorption process. The adsorption of buriti oil (Mauritia flexuosa Mart.) has been determined experimentally by the method of frontal analysis in columns packed with \u03b3-alumina at 15, 20, and 25\u00a0MPa, 333\u00a0K, and solvent flow rate of Q CO 2 = 10.6 L / min , using an assemble of coupled columns of 81\u00a0cm3, adopted to be used as an adsorption cell. The oil of buriti has been physical\u2013chemically characterized according to AOCS official methods in terms of acid, saponification, peroxide and iodine values, refraction index, density and viscosity. Chemical composition of buriti oil in terms of fatty acid esters has been performed by GC and anti-oxidants activity by the method of free radical capture (DPPH). The adsorbent was characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray powder diffraction, electron scanning microscopy, particle and pore size distribution, particle porosity and specific area. A material balance has been performed on the adsorption column to compute the cumulative mass of adsorbing species in \u03b3-alumina on supercritical adsorption process by applying a pseudo-first order kinetic model as well as an integral kinetic model. The influence of pressure on the supercritical adsorption has been investigated by analyzing the mass transfer performance. A Langmuir type isotherm has been used to model the experimental adsorption data.The results show that adsorbent capacity increases with pressure, showing a maximum of 99.486\u00a0mgOil/g\u03b3-alumina at 25\u00a0MPa. In addition, the concentration of anti-oxidant shows a tendency to increase during the curse of supercritical adsorption and with increasing system pressure. Fractions rich in anti-oxidants could be obtained at adsorption column outlet, showing a 2.0 fold enriching by 20\u00a0MPa and a 6.5 fold enriching by 25\u00a0MPa approximately, corroborating to assert this methodology as feasible to concentrate anti-oxidants from buriti oil. The supercritical adsorption of buriti oil fat soluble compounds in \u03b3-alumina using carbon dioxide as solvent may be applied as an alternative method for the enriching of anti-oxidants.",

Results were presented in terms of the concentration change (with time) of the major components namely hesperidin, hesperetin-\u03b2-glucoside and hesperetin. Experimental results showed that pressurized carbon dioxide could serve as a catalyst for the hydrothermal degradation of hesperidin that follows first-order rate kinetics. The pathways for the degradation reaction compose of complex reactions. The one involves consecutive reactions that take hesperetin-\u03b2-glucoside as an intermediate product followed by its degradation to hesperetin. Parallel to that is a reaction that directly cleaves the glycosidic bond of hesperidin to form hesperetin. The kinetic parameters of the hydrolysis reaction were estimated by least squares approximation methods, and the proposed model fitted well with the experimental data. The values of activation energies calculated based on Arrhenius equation may suggest that the cleavage of rhamnosidic bond takes lesser energy than the cleavage of glycosidic bond of hesperidin.",

Experimental protocol was guided by the development of an orthogonal design criteria consisting of temperature, CO2 pressure, time of pretreatment-hydrolysis, and substrate particle size. High pressure carbonation of the subcritical water-biomass mixtures were conducted in a small batch reactor and the resultant hydrolyzate mixtures were analyzed for sugar content using SEC and HPLC-RI detection. Also, the resultant hydrolyzates after carbonated water pretreatment were further hydrolyzed using commercial enzymes to saccharify the remaining oligomeric sugars to xylose and glucose. The resultant % sugar content of the carbonated water \u2013 versus dilute mineral acid \u2013 pretreated biomass mixtures were compared as well as the corresponding final enzymatically saccharified hydrolyzates for switchgrass and corn stover. High pressure carbonated water pretreatment yielded 9\u201313% less sugars than the sulfuric acid-derived hydrolyzate and relatively 6\u201310% less sugars were found in the final carbonated water treated hydrolyzates after further enzymatic treatment. It was also found that carbonated water pretreated switchgrass hydrolyzate required 33% lesser amount of enzyme for saccharification when compared to that obtained using dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment. The supercritical carbon dioxide dissolved in water provides an environmentally benign and \u201cgreen\u201d pretreatment method for depolymerization of the sugars present in biomass substrates and to facilitate further saccharification without the necessity of base neutralization, or pH adjustment prior to application of enzyme-initiated hydrolysis.",

In each cycle, the mixed precursor solution in CO2 is introduced to the reactor and then purged following a short reaction interval.

The effect of the operating parameters of the SAS precipitation was performed in small and large scale units, using Pluronic F127. The Supercritical Fluid Extraction of an Emulsion (SFEE) was also applied for the co-precipitation using modified starch. The encapsulation performance was evaluated by morphology and particle size, efficiency of astaxanthin encapsulation and color stability. It was possible to micro-precipitate the carotenoid extract with Pluronic F127 by SAS, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 74%. Nano-emulsion produced by SFEE presented the highest encapsulation performance and the lowest particle size. All particles produced by SAS and by SFEE obtained better color preservation compared to the crude extract.",

     "abstract": "Two different supercritical antisolvent (SAS) systems, one precipitating system and one crystallizing system, have been compared in their process behavior in dependence on the solute solubility. The SAS system YAc/DMSO/CO2, which is composed of yttrium acetate (YAc) as solute, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent and carbon dioxide (CO2) as antisolvent, precipitates amorphous particles. The SAS system PCM/EtOH/CO2, which is composed of paracetamol (PCM) as solute, ethanol (EtOH) as solvent and CO2 as antisolvent, crystallizes crystals. Applying in situ elastic and inelastic light scattering it was measured that for the precipitating SAS system YAc/DMSO/CO2 the supersaturation at the location of first particle generation (LFPG) is up to four orders of magnitude larger than for the crystallizing SAS system PCM/EtOH/CO2. This discrepancy correlates with the saturation solubilities of the solutes which found to be approximately four orders of magnitude larger for the crystallizing system than for the precipitating system, investigated by elastic light scattering. Hence, the saturation solubility of the solute in mixtures of solvents and antisolvents could be identified as the indirect classification criterion to distinguish between amorphous precipitating and crystallizing SAS systems. Furthermore, it is shown that for the crystallizing SAS system crystals may be generated from either a supercritical or a liquid phase which is in contrast to the widespread SAS opinion that crystals only can be formed in the liquid phase.",

     "abstract": "The comminution of different pharmaceutical solids by high pressure homogenization in various dispersion media has been investigated. First, the influence of two important process parameters, namely the pressure drop and the number of passes across the homogenizer, has been investigated through the homogenization of aqueous suspensions. Applying pressure drops ranging from 250 to 1000\u00a0bar and up to 200 passes across the homogenizer, it was found that smaller particles can be obtained either by working at an increased homogenization pressure or by further increasing the number of passes. The smallest particles, obtained for one of the two pharmaceutical compounds investigated by applying 50 passes at 1000\u00a0bar homogenization pressure, exhibited a very narrow size distribution with a median x50 of 1.14\u00a0\u03bcm. Moreover, experimental results could be adequately described using an empirical relationship that allows estimating a priori the median x50 of the product size distribution as a function of the aforementioned operating parameters. Furthermore, the performance of different homogenizers has been evaluated, thus showing that valve homogenizers have favorable properties as compared to static homogenizers regarding the comminution of solids. Finally, the present study demonstrates successfully the feasibility of this novel process option by applying two different pressurized dispersion fluids, namely liquid carbon dioxide or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (Solkane R134a), in the homogenization of phenytoin and of another proprietary pharmaceutical solid. These fluids are subject to residue-free evaporation upon pressure release, and at the end of the process the micronized product particles could be directly recovered in form of a dry powder.",

Two different strategies were used to impregnate the polymeric devices: supercritical fluid impregnation for scaffold uptake with a model low molecular weight drug (ibuprofen) and bulk loading to impregnate a model protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA). The release profiles showed a specific pattern according to pH and temperature. PNIPAAm temperature responsiveness is able to control BSA release but ibuprofen (Ibu) release is only mediated by pH environmental conditions.",

In this work, we focus on numerical simulation of the process, emphasizing mixing modelling. Subcritical to supercritical submerged water jets in a subcritical co-flow are analysed and validated against experimental data with good accuracy (below 5% of absolute average deviation). The main results show that mixing zones are longer at subcritical temperatures than well above the critical point. Besides, due to the low dissipation rate found, the system is poorly micromixed and complete mixing at the molecular scale is never achieved. A methodology based on the evaluation of a macro-mixing length has been used. Using this method, the presence and location of mixing zones are better identified, showing that when pressure is well above the critical point, fluid-dynamic behaviour is more similar to subcritical conditions.

The adsorption of CO2 on thermal SiO2 and the swelling of PMMA thin films on a silicon substrate were studied from atmospheric pressure up to 13.89\u00a0MPa at 35 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. A systematic analysis of the deviations between experimental and calculated spectra reveals the presence of a temperature gradient in the vicinity of CO2's critical point where large density fluctuations are present. The temperature gradient produces a graded CO2 refractive index resulting in a pressure-dependent angle of incidence. This mirage effect is analyzed with a simple model that considers the equation of state for CO2 allowing the evaluation of the temperature gradient. Our results are intended to provide a better understanding of spectroscopy ellipsometry studies in supercritical CO2.",

In this work, a mixture design was applied to optimize solvent mixtures for selective extraction of phenolic compounds from tara fruit seed coat. Pressurized solvent extractions (PSE) were performed at 313\u00a0K and 20\u00a0MPa, using homogeneous CO2, ethanol (EtOH) and H2O solvent mixtures. Extraction kinetics was obtained and phenolic contents, antioxidant activities (measured by the coupled oxidation of \u03b2-carotene and linoleic acid) and anti-inflammatory activities (measured by the lipoxygenase inhibition activity) of extracts were evaluated. A linear mixture model predicted total yields and it was verified that H2O was the most effective solvent to obtain high extraction yields. A quadratic model predicted extracts\u2019 phenolic contents and it was verified that H2O and CO2 had an antagonistic effect and that maximum phenolic contents can be expected for EtOH-rich mixtures. A special cubic model predicted anti-inflammatory activities and the maximum activities were also predicted for EtOH-rich mixtures. For the antioxidant activity, no model revealed to be significant (at a 95% confidence level). Nevertheless, high antioxidant activities were observed after 3\u00a0h of assay (above 80% of oxidation inhibition for nine out of eleven extracts) and even after 6\u00a0h of assay (above 70%). The obtained results strongly suggest that tara seed coat is a residue that has great potential to be valorized for the production of phenolic-rich extracts presenting high anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.",

A UV/Vis spectrophotometer was also used to follow the phase transitions in addition to visual observations. CO2 acted as a co-solvent at concentrations of up to \u223c0.8\u00a0mole fraction. The solubility of phytosterols in CO2-expanded ethanol increased with temperature. At 35\u00a0\u00b0C, phytosterol solubility was lower than that for cholesterol, mainly due to their larger molecular weight and the presence of hydrophobic side groups in their structure. The Wubbolts model described the experimental data well. Findings of the study provide the basis for process development for micronization of phytosterols using CO2-expanded ethanol.",

Knowledge on phase behavior is therefore desirable for optimizing the reaction conditions but often requires considerable experimental effort. Here, a previously established thermodynamic model for complex systems, based on the Cubic Plus Association (CPA) equation of state, is utilized in order to gain insight into the phase behavior during the palladium-catalyzed selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The catalytic reaction was studied in a tubular continuous reactor both under biphasic and single phase conditions at different flow rates, compositions and oxygen concentrations. In general, biphasic conditions resulted in the highest reaction rate which was also found when running the reaction in a batch reactor. On transition to a single phase a gradual deactivation of the catalyst was observed. Hence, the model predictions can be beneficially applied in order to find optimal reaction conditions. In the continuous reactor under biphasic conditions, the substrate was found to accumulate in the reactor due to segregation. The study indicates that a direct comparison between the catalytic performance observed in the continuous flow system and batch reactor under biphasic conditions requires knowledge on the influence of the segregation on flow conditions and mass transfer, which is often ignored in the literature.",

Simulations are carried out under various conditions of pressure and solvent in order to modify significantly the properties known to influence the jet breakup such as density, viscosity and surface tension. Numerical results reveal that in the range of investigated Reynolds and Ohnesorge numbers, the classical criteria used to distinguish the different modes of jet breakup at atmospheric pressure seems to be valid for the high pressure environment, agreeing thus the experimental results reported in literature. Pressure effects are emphasized in this work and we show that simulations are able to represent that a modification of pressure allows for changing the jet breakup mode, especially near the mixture critical point.

     "abstract": "The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of the culture growth stage on the inactivation kinetics of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and to find models that can describe and predict the inactivation behavior of these microorganisms considering the growth stage as one of the model parameters. Cultures of E. coli and S. cerevisiae were grown to four different growth stages: early exponential phase, intermediate exponential phase, late exponential phase and early stationary phase and then treated with SC-CO2 at 350\u00a0bar and 35\u00a0\u00b0C. The inactivation kinetics of S. cerevisiae and E. coli showed that the SC-CO2 resistance increased progressively as the growth phase advanced. For both microorganisms, the length of the lag phase increased progressively as the growth phase advanced, not appearing at all in the earliest growth stages. For S. cerevisiae, an equation based on the Gompertz Function satisfactorily described ( R avg. 2 = 0.96 ; RMSEavg.\u00a0=\u00a00.48) the inactivation kinetics of this microorganism for the four growth stages selected. Similarly, a single equation that included the dependence on the growth stage was obtained for E. coli, based on the Weibull Function ( R avg. 2 = 0.96 ; RMSEavg.\u00a0=\u00a00.53). The results reveal that the inactivation kinetics using SC-CO2 are greatly influenced by the growth stage and the application of the developed models could be used to find the optimal process conditions according to the cell's growth stage.",

Encapsulated cells would also provide a source of sustained continuous release of therapeutic products for longer durations at the site of implantation. The present work investigates the possibility of prokaryotic cells microencapsulation by Supercritical Emulsion Extraction (SEE) technology; Lactobacillus acidophilus was selected as a model bacterium and poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA, 75:25) was chosen as biopolymer because FDA approved in devices for biomedical applications.A double emulsion (w1-o-w2 ratio 2:18:80) was used with an internal water phase (w1) composition of L. acidophilus suspended in MRS broth plus the 0.4% of poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA), as surfactant; the best overall cell mass content was found to be not higher than 10\u00a0mg/mL (that correspond to 7.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0UFC/mL). Other emulsion phases were: o-phase containing ethyl acetate (EA) and PLGA at 10% (w/w) and w2-phase of water plus 0.6% of PVA (w/w). This emulsion treated by SEE at 90\u00a0bar and 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min allowed the formation of PLGA microcapsules with a mean size of 20\u00a0\u03bcm (\u00b110\u00a0\u03bcm) loaded with the 0.6% (w/w) of microorganism with an excellent encapsulation efficiency (80%).Size and morphology of the produced microdevices were monitored by laser scattering and by SEM-EDX analyses and confirmed SEE as an innovative and efficient encapsulation technology. Particularly, the microspheres were constituted by a PLGA wall containing the cells entrapped into the polymeric matrix. Cell viability less than 5% (w/w) with respect to the loaded microorganism was also evaluated; nevertheless the biodegradable microdevice produced may be particularly interesting for several biotechnological application in which mainly the killed vectors is used as bioactive signal delivery.",

     "publication date": "03-2012",
     "abstract": "Addition of nucleating agents (e.g., talc) is a common way to promote the cell density in polymeric foaming process. It is widely believed that such enhancement is caused by the decrease in free energy barrier for the nucleation to initiate heterogeneously as well as the reduction in gas loss with the existence of the inorganic fillers. In this paper, in situ visualization of the cell formation phenomena during polymeric foaming processes of polystyrene\u2013talc composites blown with carbon dioxide revealed that the expansion of nucleated cells triggered the formation of secondary cells around them. Subsequently, the expansion of the secondary cells also promoted the formation of tertiary cells around them similar to a chain reaction. These observations provided evidences to support the theoretical simulation of stress-induced cell formation around expanding bubbles. A series of parametric studies were conducted to correlate the stress-induced cell formation and various processing and material parameters. The elucidation of the aforementioned cell formation mechanism with the presence of nucleating agents would provide additional guidelines for polymeric foam manufacturers to control the cell morphologies of their products in order to optimize and tailor the desired physical properties.",

Mixtures were processed from acetone using the batch gas antisolvent method. Polyethylene glycols and Eudragits were selected as polymers capable to modify the drug dissolution behavior. Morphology, size distribution, crystal lattice and dissolution kinetic were characterized. Products were recovered as powders providing a polymer/silica ratio of 50/50, with coarser grains in Eudragits powders compared to PEG's. The size distribution evidenced populations between 10 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm that were not obtained when TBM was single processed, together with larger agglomerates. In terms of precipitation mechanism, the drug has grown almost unaffected by the presence of silica and polymer in the liquor except for a smaller size, since neither the morphology nor the crystal lattice was significantly changed. The products exhibited substantially different rates of dissolution in accordance with the polymer function: the water-soluble PEGs improved the dissolution rate whereas the water-insoluble Eudragit sustained notably the drug release.",

     "abstract": "The one- and two-phase isochoric heat capacities (CV) of isobutanol in the critical and supercritical regions have been measured with a high-temperature and high-pressure nearly constant-volume adiabatic calorimeter. The measurements were made in the temperature range from 324\u00a0K to 575\u00a0K for 23 isochores (16 liquid and 7 vapor) from 73.2\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123 to 772.2\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123. The isochoric heat capacity jump (quasi-static thermograms supplemented by the sensor of adiabatic control) technique have been used to accurately measure of the phase transition parameters (TS, \u03c1S). The total experimental uncertainty of density (\u03c1), temperature (T), and isochoric heat capacity (CV) were estimated to be 0.06%, 15\u00a0mK, and 2\u20133%, respectively. The critical temperature (TC\u00a0=\u00a0547.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0K) and the critical density (\u03c1C\u00a0=\u00a0272.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123) for isobutanol were determined from the measured saturated properties (CVS, TS, \u03c1S) near the critical point. The measured CV and saturated density (TS, \u03c1S) data near the critical point have been analyzed and interpreted in terms of extended scaling type equations for the selected thermodynamic paths (critical isochore and coexistence curve) to accurately calculate the values of the asymptotical critical amplitudes of heat capacity ( A 0 \u00b1 ) and coexistence curve (B0). The experimentally derived value of the critical amplitude ratio A 0 + / A 0 \u2212 = 0.522 is in good agreement with the value predicted by various scaling theories. The measured thermodynamic properties (CV, TS, \u03c1S) of isobutanol near the critical point were also interpreted in the terms of \u201ccomplete scaling\u201d theory of critical phenomena. In particularly, the contributions of the \u201ccomplete\u201d and \u201cincomplete\u201d scaling terms on the coexistence-curve singular diameter were estimated. We determined the values of the asymmetry parameters a3 and b2 of the coexistence curve singular diameter. The strength of the Yang\u2013Yang anomaly R\u03bc for isobutanol was estimated using asymmetry parameters a3 and the contribution of the second temperature derivative of vapor-pressure and chemical potential in the singularity of two-phase CV2. The measured values of saturated one- and two-phase liquid and vapor isochoric heat capacities ( C \u2032 V 1 , C \u2033 V 1 , C \u2032 V 2 , C \u2033 V 2 ) and saturated thermal (\u03c1S, TS) properties together with vapor-pressure (PS, TS) data were used to calculate other derived thermodynamic properties such as (KT, \u0394 H vap , CP, CS, W, ( \u2202 P / \u2202 T ) \u2032 V , ( \u2202 V / \u2202 T ) \u2032 P , ( d 2 P S / d T 2 ) , and ( d 2 \u03bc / d T 2 ) of isobutanol at saturation near the critical point.",

     "abstract": "This review focuses on the potential synergy between fluid properties and supercritical (SC) processing/combustion of biodiesel fuels. These fuels are the extenders/expanders of choice for petroleum-derived diesel fuels (PDDF) due to overall performance in the environment, safety, feedstock, and fuel quality. A typical biodiesel fuel meets commercial specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D6751) or European Union (EN 14214). Biodiesel fuels, mainly mixtures of fatty acid methyl or ethyl esters (FAMEs or FAEEs), are currently produced by base/acid catalytic transesterification (BAC-TE) of triglyceride feedstocks with methanol or ethanol. These methods require refined oil feedstocks and complex product separation/purification that leads to noncompetitive prices compared with PDDFs. Alternatively, a noncatalytic technology based on SC-TE processing of various lipid feedstocks has been reported to mitigate these drawbacks. One version of this technology, the one-step SC-TE method, potentially has major advantages over the BAC-TE, mainly due to shorter reaction times (5\u20139\u00a0min versus 1\u20136\u00a0h) and the reduction of glycerol to acceptable ASTM levels in fuels of superior quality. The latter advantage originates from glycerol and polyunsaturated FAME/FAEE thermal conversion to lighter fuel products. Based on technical and economic analyses, the manufacturing cost of biodiesel fuels from a one-step SC-TE process could be one half of the BAC-TE current cost. To optimize biodiesel fuel production and quality, leading to a more efficient and clean combustion, a close connection between fluid properties and fuel processing/combustion must be considered. Insights from recent case studies and real-world examples of applications of the principles of sustainability in the development and implementation of biodiesel fuel projects are given. The review includes sustainability metrics, resource efficiency, and sustainable process integration. These themes are woven together into a perspective on how sustainability and green-chemistry principles are being implemented for cost-effective biodiesel fuel production and advanced combustion.",

     "abstract": "Fuel cells (FCs) are emerging as devices for electricity generation in a new economic era where energy is increasingly obtained from renewable sources. FCs operate with relatively higher efficiencies as compared to internal combustion engines due to the direct conversion of chemical energy to electricity by electrochemical reactions. However, there exist a number of obstacles for their widespread acceptance and integration in our daily lives. These obstacles can be summarized as the high cost of FCs due to the high costs of materials, the need to process fuels to very high-purity levels, the unacceptable declines in performance with time as well as the absence of a H2 infrastructure. Applications of supercritical fluids (SCFs) in synthesis of novel materials and development of new processing techniques offer a wide range of opportunities that can help commercialization of FCs. These include the preparation of micro or nanoarchitectured materials in a highly controllable manner for electrolyte-electrode assemblies of a wide variety of FCs including proton exchange membrane FCs (PEMFCs) and solid oxide FCs (SOFCs). In this extent, materials synthesized using SCFs are (at least) comparable or superior in performance as compared to their conventional counterparts. The synthesis and processing of novel materials necessary for efficient hydrogen storage/processing and design of novel processes for H2 production may also benefit from the use of SCFs.",

     "abstract": "A large number of pharmaceutical compounds are orally administered to the human body. If the drug shows a poor water-solubility and therewith low dissolution rate, a high dosage is needed which may cause undesired side effects to the human body. To improve the dissolution properties of these poorly water-soluble drugs, a large number of various strategies including micronisation, nano-emulsions and polymeric micelles are applied. In this paper we report on the formation of submicron carbamazepine particles by rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS). The unprocessed and processed carbamazepine powder was characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dissolution rate measurements. Due to the existence of four different polymorphic forms of carbamazepine, one focus is on the modification or change of the crystal structure of carbamazepine caused by RESS. The experimental results show that the particle size can be reduced at least by a factor of 29 to median sizes between 0.43 and 0.9\u00a0\u03bcm and that pure C-monoclinic carbamazepine particles can be produced for pre-expansion temperatures \u2265363\u00a0K.

Seventeen different experimental data were obtained and response surface modeling (RSM) was employed to find relation between extraction yield and process variables. A second order polynomial based on statistical analysis with 95% confidence limits was found as the best estimator of extraction yields.In the next step of the study, artificial neural network (ANN) as a soft computing method was applied to predict the oil yield. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) was used in this study. In order to implement an ANN, temperature, extraction time and the number of extraction cycles were selected as input variables and oil yield was considered as target variable. 70% of data were utilized for training and 30% of the remaining data were used for testing the best obtained network. The results illustrated that ANN method is more reliable than RSM method for extraction prediction and optimization. The optimum operating conditions were found at 100\u00a0\u00b0C, 10\u00a0min and 2 cycles.",

     "abstract": "The interest in the anthocyanin pigments has increased because of their possible utilization as natural food colorants and especially as antioxidant and anti-in\ufb02ammatory agents. Andes Berry fruits are dark purple to almost black colored due to its high content of antioxidants, which makes these fruits a good source of anthocyanins. In this paper, an alternative for antioxidant extraction from Andes Berry fruits (Rubus glaucus Benth) was evaluated. The enhanced-fluidity liquid extraction units were simulated using a commercial simulator software for real process conditions. Antioxidants from Andes Berry fruits were extracted using both traditional solvent processes with ethanol as solvent and a pilot scale enhanced-fluidity liquid extraction plant using CO2 and ethanol. Using the enhanced-fluidity liquid extraction process the yields were improved up to 59.3% compared to the traditional process. The results obtained with both experimental and simulation assessments showed that enhanced-fluidity liquid extraction using ethanol as co-solvent is the most appropriate technology to extract anthocyanin from Andes Berry fruits. Moreover, it was concluded that simulation techniques are powerful tools that allow minimizing time, costs and experimentation in the design of processes such as the extraction of antioxidants.",

     "abstract": "Epidemiological and clinical studies in the recent years have shown that the importance of the indoor air quality to human health should not be underestimated. The assessment of indoor quality requires efficient and reliable methods producing useful information particularly on that related to indoor dust. A significant task in designing mitigation or prevention measures is to identify firstly the classes of compounds that are present in house dust and secondly obtain their contribution in the samples particularly that of low-volatile or non-volatile organic compounds, for which sparse data is available. Extraction of house dust can be used as a screening method for high boiling organic compounds in the indoor environment. Most published work so far, on organic compounds of low volatility and on particulate organic matter has been focused on a few classes of compounds of known toxicity. However, the absence of knowledge on other possibly present classes of compounds could be crucial in determining the extent of exposure. To override this lack of knowledge, the present study introduces a new method based on supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) to detect the classes of the low-volatile or non-volatile organic compounds that are present in the house-dust samples. The application of the particular method of SFE with CO2 can help to extract and analyze a broad range of low volatile organic compounds in dust of indoor environments, which can lead effectively to a more complete characterization. The particular extraction/analytical method for organics in house dust has been set up consisting of a two step supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with CO2 and CO2\u00a0+\u00a05% of methanol, collection of the extracts on ODS trap, elution of the extracted compounds with methanol and n-hexane and GC/MS analysis of the eluates.",

     "abstract": "Maritime pine bark, an abundant Portuguese residue rich in high-value phenolic compounds, was subjected to fractionated and non-fractionated high pressure extractions (F-HPE and NF-HPE, respectively). Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) was the chosen solvent to extract the pine bark low-polarity fraction and ethanol (EtOH) was added to scCO2 to recover the phenolic fraction. The effect of the solvent flow rate was studied on first step (scCO2) and second step (CO2:EtOH 90:10, v/v) F-HPE kinetics. Due to the low first step yield (0.6\u20131.0%, d.b.) HPE was further performed with no fractionation at 303\u00a0K and \u223c25\u00a0MPa. The flow rate that achieved the highest global yield (7.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0kg/s) was chosen to carry out NF-HPE with different EtOH compositions (30\u201390%, v/v). The HPE results were compared with hydrodistillation and Soxhlet extraction results in terms of global yields, extracts compositions and extracts antioxidant activities. The results showed that fractionation, solvent flow rate and solvent composition affected extraction kinetics and the characteristics of the extracts. In particular, the solvent composition CO2:EtOH (30:70) led to the extract with the highest contents of total phenolic compounds and of procyanidins (25.6% and 19.8%, respectively), being similar to the ones achieved by Soxhlet extraction (26.0% and 18.2%, respectively). The HPE methodology takes advantage over the conventional methodology due to the reduced EtOH consumption, lower solvent-to-solid ratio, lower extraction temperature, and oxygen-free medium in which it occurs.",

The method consists in cyclic filling of SCW up to the given pressure (pressurization) into the tubular reactor, filled with coal particles, and fast discharging of conversion products dissolved in SCW (depressurization). The dynamics and composition of conversion products in a mode of stepwise temperature (310\u2013460\u00a0\u00b0C) and pressure (9\u201331\u00a0MPa) rise at cyclic filling and discharging of, first, the water vapor (T\u00a0<\u00a0374\u00a0\u00b0C), and then of SCW have been investigated. The vapor stage of conversion has prevented agglomeration of coal particles at the stage of SCW conversion. The maximum yield of the condensed products is obtained at 390\u00a0\u00b0C, 29.0\u00a0MPa. High heating value of combustible products of conversion and solid residue appeared to be much more than that of initial coal because of removal of a great bulk (up to 85.2%) of native oxygen as CO2. H/C atomic ratio in the volatile combustible and condensed products is much higher than in the conversion residue because of redistribution of native hydrogen in coal organic matter (COM). It has been established that sulfur is mainly removed from COM as H2S (up to 77.2%) and nitrogen is concentrated (up to 67.2%) in the solid conversion residue.",

The polymer has good thermal stability. Additionally, the adsorption behaviors of methylene blue (MB) by the copolymers were evaluated. The effect of reaction pressure, cross-linker ratio, polymer structure, pH values of solution, MB concentration, and adsorption time on adsorption capacity was also investigated. The results revealed that cross-linked copolymer has a high adsorption capacity of 343.23\u00a0mg/g for MB under the conditions of pH 9 and crosslinker ratio of 5.8%. The findings show that cross-linked copolymer materials can be used for large-scale dye adsorption.",

The vapour\u2013liquid or vapour\u2013liquid\u2013liquid equilibrium and phase distribution of ethanol and triolein were investigated in order to determine the range of pressure and temperature required for high oil conversion. The phase equilibrium of the triolein and ethanol mixture (1:40 and 1:26 molar ratio of triolein to ethanol) was monitored in a view cell in order to determine the phase transition during heating of mixture up to 195\u00a0\u00b0C (the corresponding pressure was 25 and 26\u00a0bar). The experimental data were simulated using ASPENplus\u00ae and UniSim\u00ae software and results obtained using RK-Aspen EOS were found to correlate well with the experimental data. Simulation results show the important influence of the phase equilibrium on the reaction mechanism and overall kinetics under subcritical conditions (T\u00a0<\u00a0270\u00a0\u00b0C at 200\u00a0bar) since the two liquid phases exist at the beginning of reaction, thereby limiting the contact between the reactants. In case of single reaction phase (T\u00a0>\u00a0270\u00a0\u00b0C at 200\u00a0bar) the initially high reaction rate is limited at high conversion levels due to increasing extent of reversible reaction.",

     "abstract": "Volumetric properties of carbon dioxide, ethyl acetate and their binary mixtures containing 27.7, 42.6, 52.9 and 67.3% by mass CO2 have been determined over a temperature range from 295 to 380\u00a0K for pure components, and from 295 to 340\u00a0K for mixtures at pressures up to 32\u00a0MPa.A new measurement methodology was employed in which a pressure-generator is used to alter the position of a movable piston while continually monitoring its position, thus the internal volume, with a computer-interfaced linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The real-time recording of the internal volume permits generation of continuous density\u2013pressure data which are correlated by smooth functions and used to determine the isothermal compressibility, the isobaric expansivity, the thermal pressure coefficient, and the excess volumes. The densities were observed to vary in the range from 0.60 to 0.98\u00a0g/cm3 for carbon dioxide; from 0.80 to 0.92\u00a0g/cm3 for ethyl acetate, and from 0.75 to 0.98\u00a0g/cm3 for the mixtures. Depending upon the temperature and pressure, the compressibility values were in the range 0.002\u20130.04\u00a0MPa\u22121 for CO2, and 1.0\u20132.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0MPa\u22121 for ethyl acetate.

In the mixtures, the isothermal compressibility and isobaric expansivity were found to increase while the thermal pressure coefficients decreased in going from ethyl acetate to carbon dioxide. The mixtures displayed mostly negative excess volumes. The magnitude of the negative excess volume was observed to decrease with pressure at a given temperature, but increase with increasing temperature at a given pressure. The largest (negative) excess volume, approaching \u221216\u00a0cm3/mol, was observed at the higher experimental temperature (340\u00a0K) and the lower pressure (16\u00a0MPa).",

The interest in the tested mixtures derives primarily from carbon capture and storage applications. In particular, CO2-rich streams with low amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and argon are representative of the flows that are treated by the compression units and the purification units employed in the oxy-fuel fired power plants. These flows are then transported from power plants to storage sites in supercritical conditions. For each type of binary mixture, two different molar compositions are here considered. Isothermal pressure\u2013density\u2013temperature measurements are performed for all the mixtures in a temperature range from 303\u00a0K to 383\u00a0K and in a pressure range from 1\u00a0MPa to 20\u00a0MPa by way of a vibrating tube densimeter-based apparatus.

Both mixtures showed the same trend in the separation performance exhibiting a maximum in the separation efficiency in the temperature range studied, and showing a preferential separation of sodium and phosphate or potassium and sulfate ions depending on the temperature of the separator vessel.The mixtures of Na3PO4/Na2SO4 and Na2SO4/K2SO4 were \u201creal type 2 salt mixtures\u201d, i.e. mixtures in which the permutation of the ions does not lead to the formation of a type 1 salt in the respective mixture. The salts from the Na3PO4/Na2SO4 mixture could not be recovered as a concentrated brine. This salt mixture behaved as would be expected for the respective single type 2 salt solutions of either Na3PO4 or Na2SO4.Interestingly, a concentrated brine could be recovered for the Na2SO4/K2SO4 mixture with the salt recovery in the brine effluent showing a maximum at a separator setpoint temperature of 450\u2013460\u00a0\u00b0C.

As a conclusion, the high pressure extraction method enhanced the cytotoxicity and the antitumor activity of extract from C. verbenacea.

The effects of reaction parameters were investigated to determine the optimum reaction conditions. The highest content of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from refined lard was 89.91%, which was obtained at a temperature of 335\u00a0\u00b0C, a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 45, a pressure of 20\u00a0MPa, a reaction time of 15\u00a0min, and an agitation speed of 500\u00a0rpm. Biodiesel production from waste lard under the optimal reaction conditions was also carried out to validate the use of waste lard as a feedstock. Even though waste lard samples contain various free fatty acids and water contents, FAME contents from waste lard with no pre-treatment were found to be comparable with those from refined lard. From this result, it is concluded that waste lard can be utilized as an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production using a supercritical process, thus replacing the high-cost refined vegetable oil feedstock.",

     "abstract": "We report results from a systematic study of the gasification of the alga Nannochloropsis sp. in supercritical water at 450\u2013550\u00a0\u00b0C. The gaseous products were mainly H2, CO2, and CH4, with lesser amounts of CO, C2H4, and C2H6. Higher temperatures, longer reaction times, higher water densities, and lower algae loadings provided higher gas yields. The algae loading strongly affected the H2 yield, which more than tripled when the loading was reduced from 15\u00a0wt% to 1\u00a0wt%. The water density had little effect on the gas composition. The temporal variation of intermediate products indicated that some (e.g., alkanes) reacted quickly whereas others (aromatics) reacted more slowly. On the basis of this observation and the complete set of experimental results, we propose a global reaction network for algae SCWG that includes parallel primary pathways to each of these two types of intermediate products. The intermediate products then produce gases.",

     "abstract": "Typical monosaccharides, which constitute hemicelluloses and cellulose of lignocellulosic materials, were treated in batch hot compressed water to investigate monosaccharides\u2019 isomerization and decomposition. It was found that glucose and mannose were isomerized to each other while galactose was isomerized to tagatose and talose. On the other hand, arabinose was isomerized to ribulose and ribose while xylose was isomerized to xylulose and lyxose. Additionally, these isomerization products\u2019 formation was not only affected by initial monosaccharides but also the reaction conditions. Similarly the dehydration and the fragmentation reactions also depended on reaction conditions, in which possibly dehydration occurred firstly and fragmentation reaction followed. Furthermore, furfural was also detected when hexoses were treated in hot compressed water and it was proposed that furfural was formed via hexose fragmentation reactions through a pentose and formaldehyde pathway. On the other hand, the detection of 5-HMF when pentoses were treated in hot compressed water provided a hint that not only retro-aldol condensation reaction but also aldol condensation occurred when monosaccharides were treated in hot-compressed water. Based on these experiments, some new isomerization, fragmentation and dehydration reaction pathways were proposed to supplement previous knowledge on monosaccharides\u2019 decomposition scheme in hot compressed water.",

     "abstract": "Many biomaterial-based regenerative therapies require foam structures, which temporarily mimic the extracellular matrix. The pore structure of these scaffolds needs to be tailored to the specific requirements of the clinical application. Poly(\u025b-caprolactone) (PCL) is a semi-crystalline, aliphatic polyester, which is applied as degradable implant material. In this paper we explored how thermodynamic and kinetic conditions in a supercritical CO2 (scCO2) supported foaming process influence the final morphology of the foam. With help of a view cell, we have systematically investigated the foaming with scCO2 in the pressure range from 78 to 200\u00a0bar at temperatures between 25 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. Foams were obtained both above the pressure dependent melting temperature (Tm) but also below this temperature, i.e. from supercooled melt states. Foams were characterized by \u03bcCT X-ray computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. The pore size distributions of the obtained foams show characteristic properties (widths, maxima) depending on the initial thermodynamic state of the CO2/PCL system before pressure quenching, the rate of the pressure decay, and the thermal history of the system. We try to rationalize the dependency of foam morphology and quench conditions with thermodynamic model calculations. The initial amount of CO2 in the PCL melt was calculated with the Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state. Pressure quenching with a slow pressure decay rate is considered an isothermal process where for a fast rate an adiabatic process is assumed. Both processes differ in their phase separation mechanism. It turned out that the CO2-induced melting point depression of the semi-crystalline polymer is an important factor. The variation of foaming conditions allows the preparation of scaffolds with specific morphological parameters (mean pore size, pore distribution, and pore connectivity).",

The conditions to form the wrinkles were investigated by systematically changing the experimental parameters such as temperature, pressure, treating time, depressurization rate, ambient gas, with or without of water, 20\u00a0wt.% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. The conditions favorable to form large pleat-like wrinkles are low temperature (40\u00a0\u00b0C), high pressure (20\u00a0MPa), long treating times (60\u00a0min), and fast depressurization rate (0.80\u00a0MPa\u00a0min\u22121). Water plays an important role. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is more effective than air and helium to form wrinkles. It is assumed that the wrinkles were formed in the following sequence: water in which high-pressure CO2 is dissolved infiltrates the cotton and swells it. When the pressure is reduced, CO2 in water leaves the cotton. The degasification speeds of CO2 on the surface of cotton are different from that of the interior. The cross section of cotton has a flat and awkward shape. As a result, the cotton shrinks unevenly, and the wrinkles are formed on the surface. It is also confirmed that the wrinkles formed on the surface of cotton firmly support nanoparticles of titanium oxide (TiO2) when the cotton was immersed in water where TiO2 nanoparticles of average 35\u00a0nm in diameter were dispersed at concentrations under 2\u00a0wt.%. The process can be used to support functional agents firmly on cotton without using binders. This technique is useful for the support of functional agents on the surface of cotton.",

Exfoliated GOs are shown to be mostly single-layer sheets in aqueous solution, and they are also demonstrated for conversion to recover some of the properties intrinsic to graphene. Beyond the commonly used thermal annealing and chemical reduction methods, several environmentally friendly conversion strategies have been explored in the literature. Reported here is a method of annealing GOs in supercritical fluids (SCFs, including carbon dioxide and ethanol) at relatively lower temperatures (up to only 300\u00a0\u00b0C) for their conversion to reduced GOs (rGOs). The characteristic properties of SCFs include low densities (thus low viscosity/high diffusivity) and diminished surface tension, which have found successful applications in extraction and the cleaning of fragile electronic devices, and also found to enable lower-temperature crystallization of amorphous nanomaterials in a fluid-assisted calcination process. In this study the same principles for lower-temperature calcination in SCFs were applied to the conversion of GOs. The rGOs thus obtained were characterized, with their electrical and thermal conductive properties evaluated and correlated with the different processing conditions. The benefits and shortcomings of the SCF processing method are discussed.",

SC-CO2 has the ability to diffuse into the amorphous or glassy regions of polymers, resulting in polymer swelling. This study was carried out to evaluate the behavior of pregelatinized corn starch (PGS) in SC-CO2 and to determine its potential impregnation with oleic acid and flax oil in SC-CO2 media. Starch was mixed with either oleic acid or flax oil and held in SC-CO2 at 15 or 30\u00a0MPa and 40, 60 or 80\u00a0\u00b0C under static or dynamic conditions. The resulting particles were analyzed to determine impregnation efficiency. Scanning electron micrographs confirmed the effectiveness of the washing treatment employed to remove surface oil. The SC-CO2 treatment did not affect PGS particle size. Higher impregnation efficiencies were obtained with oleic acid compared to those obtained with flax oil. For oleic acid, the highest efficiency was found at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 15\u00a0MPa (11.4% w/w) under static conditions, while for flax oil, only 6.6% (w/w) impregnation efficiency was achieved at 30\u00a0MPa and 80\u00a0\u00b0C and there were no significant differences among treatments. Both solubility and diffusion of oleic acid or flax oil in SC-CO2 play an important role in the impregnation process. Findings indicate that SC-CO2 technology has potential for food-grade polymer impregnation targeting nutraceutical delivery.",

Present industrial processes and emerging technologies that use supercritical fluids are highlighted. Supercritical fluids are being used in transcritical cycles for heat transfer due to their favorable thermophysical properties and their environmental compatibility. Supercritical water is being proposed as a reaction solvent for zinc silicate industrial phosphors, since it allows production of luminescent materials at low temperatures (400\u00a0\u00b0C) and with less energy than industrial solid-state methods that require high temperatures (1200\u00a0\u00b0C). Supercritical CO2\u2013ionic liquid systems have much potential as biphasic systems for reactions and separations, however, when used for chiral separations, the selectivity of these systems is not well understood yet. The use of supercritical CO2 for viscosity reduction in ionic liquid reaction systems seems to be a favorable research area with conversion of d-fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in high yields (>90%) being an example. Systems to convert biomass to energy by direct oxidation in supercritical water are under development. Many opportunities exist for developing green chemical processes with supercritical fluids.",

     "abstract": "A discussion of the most interesting results obtained in our laboratories, during the supercritical CO2 extraction of bioactive compounds from microalgae and volatile oils from aromatic plants, was carried out. Concerning the microalgae, the studies on Botryococcus braunii and Chlorella vulgaris were selected. Hydrocarbons from the first microalgae, which are mainly linear alkadienes (C23\u2013C31) with an odd number of carbon atoms, were selectively extracted at 313\u00a0K increasing the pressure up to 30.0\u00a0MPa. These hydrocarbons are easily extracted at this pressure, since they are located outside the cellular walls. The extraction of carotenoids, mainly canthaxanthin and astaxanthin, from C. vulgaris is more difficult. The extraction yield of these components at 313\u00a0K and 35.0\u00a0MPa increased with the degree of crushing of the microalga, since they are not extracellular. On the other hand, for the extraction of volatile oils from aromatic plants, studies on Mentha pulegium and Satureja montana L. were chosen. For the first aromatic plant, the composition of the volatile and essential oils was similar, the main components being the pulegone and menthone. However, this volatile oil contained small amounts of waxes, which content decreased with decreasing particle size of the plant matrix. For S. montana L. it was also observed that both oils have a similar composition, the main components being carvacrol and thymol. The main difference is the relative amount of thymoquinone, which content can be 15 times higher in volatile oil. This oxygenated monoterpene has important biological activities. Moreover, experimental studies on anticholinesterase activity of supercritical extracts of S. montana were also carried out. The supercritical nonvolatile fraction, which presented the highest content of the protocatechuic, vanilic, chlorogenic and (+)-catechin acids, is the most promising inhibitor of the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase. In contrast, the Soxhlet acetone extract did not affect the activity of this enzyme at the concentrations tested.",

     "abstract": "An advanced method for producing nano-structured materials has been developed by performing pulsed laser ablation of gold plate in supercritical CO2 (SCCO2). The method successfully generated gold nano-structured particles with allowing the selective generation of clusters. Laser ablation was performed with an excitation wavelength of 532\u00a0nm. Generated gold nano-structured particles collected in the silicon (Si) wafer and the ablated gold plate were analyzed by field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and 3D laser scanning microscopy. Absorption spectrum of generated gold nano-structured particles collected in the glass slide was also evaluated by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Gold plate was ablated at various SCCO2 densities and irradiation time at constant temperature of 40 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Both surface of ablated gold plate and amount of gold nano-structured particles were significantly affected by the changes in SCCO2 density and the surrounding environment. Surface morphology of ablated gold plate was significantly affected by irradiation time. As increasing irradiation time, plume deposited in the crater vicinity of ablated gold plate was clearly observed. The depth of crater increased with increasing pressure or SCCO2 density and temperature due to heat transfer properties of CO2 change in the system. The deepest crater was observed at 10\u00a0MPa and 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The spectra of generated gold nano-structured particles in a glass slide contain bands near 530\u00a0nm. The peak near 530\u00a0nm has been known to correspond to the plasmon band of gold nanospheres with diameters <50\u00a0nm. In FE-SEM image of the generated gold nano-structured particles on the Si wafer, a network structure of smaller gold particles was fabricated. The network structure consisted of a chain of nanospheres with a mean diameter of 15\u00a0nm was observed at 10\u00a0MPa and 60\u00a0\u00b0C of PLA. Based on the results, this new method can also be used to obtain other nano-structured metals with various forms.",

     "abstract": "A technique to generate supercritical fluid (SCF) particles has gained attention in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and paint applications. However, the scarcity of information on the design of this type of laboratory-scale equipment is a significant obstacle to its technological progress. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to design and develop a laboratory supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) system for producing microparticles and microcapsules of acetaminophen. The designed SAS system was operated at 110\u00a0bars of pressure, 35\u00a0\u00b0C, 35\u00a0mg/ml polymer concentration and 1.75\u00a0ml/min feed flow rate. The morphological, thermal and crystallographic properties of the microparticles and microcapsules were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray powder diffraction, respectively. The in vitro drug release by the microparticles and microcapsules was also investigated. Following the SAS process, a more homogenous microparticle size distribution was observed in addition to a change in the crystallinity, and the drug thermal stability was maintained. Furthermore, the microcapsules significantly prolonged the drug release during the in vitro study. These results demonstrate that the designed SAS system successfully produced microparticles and microcapsules of the selected drug.",

The presence of compressed CO2 had strong plasticization effect on the iPP matrix and retarded the formation of critical size nuclei, which effectively postponed the crystallization peak to lower temperature region. On the basis of these findings, a new foaming strategy was utilized to fabricate iPP foams using the ordinary unmodified linear iPP with supercritical CO2 as the foaming agent. The foaming temperature range of this strategy was determined to be as wide as 40\u00a0\u00b0C and the upper and lower temperature limits were 155 and 105\u00a0\u00b0C, which were determined by the melt strength and crystallization temperature of the iPP specimen under supercritical CO2, respectively.

The present work is dedicated to the impregnation of intraocular lenses (IOLs) with antibiotics using supercritical carbon dioxide as impregnation vector. Commercially available intraocular lenses have been impregnated with cefuroxime sodium in order to obtain ophthalmic drug delivery systems dedicated to the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in cataract surgery.The influence of the variation of some experimental operating conditions such as the pressure (8\u201320\u00a0MPa), the temperature (308 and 333\u00a0K), the impregnation duration (1\u20135\u00a0h), the addition of a cosolvent (ethanol) or the depressurisation rate (slow and rapid depressurisation) has been studied. In certain experimental conditions, foaming phenomena have been observed.In order to evaluate the impregnation efficiency, the impregnation yields were quantified gravimetrically and the drug release profiles were determined through in vitro drug release studies carried out at 310\u00a0K and in a solution simulating the aqueous humor.At rapid depressurisation rates, controlled drug release IOLs with impregnation yields varying between 0.002 and 0.063\u00a0mgdrug/mgIOL were obtained. Increasing the pressure or adding a cosolvent were favourable to enhance the impregnation yields. However, a non desired foaming phenomenon was observed for the most favourable conditions.By carrying out slow depressurisations, foaming phenomena were avoided. Nevertheless, in these conditions, the impregnation process was less efficient.The drug partition seems to be more favourable towards the supercritical phase than towards the polymer and the impregnation phenomena governed by a deposition mechanism rather than a molecular dispersion of the active ingredient. The drug is almost deposited within the porosity created during the rapid depressurisation phase. This result was confirmed by the results of the drug release studies.",

     "abstract": "The present work has studied the influence of CO2 pressurization on the hydrogenation of nitrostyrene (NS) using Pt/TiO2. With CO2 pressurization up to 12\u00a0MPa (CO2-dissolved expanded liquid (CXL) phase), the over-all reaction rate and the selectivity to aminostyrene (AS) increased. At higher CO2 pressures where all NS dissolved in scCO2 (scCO2-homogeneous phase), both of them decreased with increasing the CO2 pressure. The phase behavior was an important factor for the present reaction system. It was also found that the presence of pressurized CO2 gave higher selectivity to AS than in its absence at any conversion level. This was ascribed to retardation effects of dense phase CO2 on the hydrogenation of AS to ethylaniline. Competitive adsorption of nitro and vinyl groups was suggested to determine the product selectivity. FTIR measurements showed that the pressurized CO2 lowers the reactivity of the nitro group, and this effect is stronger in scCO2-homogeneous phase than in CXL phase, resulting in the lower AS selectivity in the former phase. Lower Pt loadings and higher catalyst reduction temperatures gave Pt/TiO2 catalysts more selective for the AS formation. FTIR measurements of adsorbed CO over the catalysts suggested that the presence of less-coordinated Pt atoms on edge, corner and kink sites was significant for the selective hydrogenation of NS to AS.",

To obtain metallic cobalt nanoparticles, several series of experiments were conducted with changing amount of formic acid. The produced cobalt nanoparticles were characterized with XRD, TEM and SEM. To estimate the required amount of H2, EOSs were employed (ideal gas law, SRK EOS and PSRK EOS). The results of PSRK EOS were well matched with experimental data and gave good explanation for formation of metallic cobalt nanoparticles. Important thing is that required amount of H2 was much smaller than estimated by using ideal gas law. This result suggests that around the critical point of water, fugacity of H2 increased drastically and this leads to reduce the required amount of H2 for the synthesis of cobalt nanoparticles.",

The chemical species in the liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The effect of pressure and reaction time on the decomposition process was presented.

The melting behavior of \u03b2-iPP under compressed CO2 was investigated using high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The result showed that the melting temperatures of \u03b2-form and the recrystallized \u03b1-form in iPP (\u03b1-iPP) decreased linearly with increasing CO2 pressure at a nearly same slope of \u22121.2\u00a0\u00b0C/MPa, indicating the helix conformation but not the crystal structure in iPP played an important role in determining the plasticization effect of CO2 on iPP. In situ high-pressure Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was also applied to detect the melting process of \u03b2-iPP under atmospheric N2 and compressed CO2. It was revealed that the melting process of \u03b2-iPP was comprised of three stages, i.e., the melting of \u03b2-iPP, \u03b2\u03b1-recrystallization and melting of recrystallized \u03b1-iPP. The \u03b2\u03b1-recrystallization was shortened with increasing CO2 pressure due to the gradually increased \u03b2\u03b1-recrystallization rate, and disappeared at the CO2 pressure of 6\u00a0MPa.

Commercial and synthesized 2ZnO\u00b73B2O3\u00b73H2O and ZnO\u00b7B2O3\u00b72H2O samples were dried by both conventional and SCE drying methods and the products were compared. Zinc borates were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and helium pycnometer. Zn and B contents of samples were also determined by analytical titration. It was found that zinc borate of ZnO\u00b7B2O3\u00b72H2O decomposed completely into zinc oxide and boric acid. However, zinc borate having oxide formula of 2ZnO\u00b73B2O3\u00b73H2O decomposed partially to form anhydrous zinc borate, zinc oxide, water and boric acid during the SCE drying carried out at 250\u00a0\u00b0C and 6.5\u00a0MPa. Boric acid and water were extracted from both of zinc borates by supercritical ethanol. The extraction of boric acid by ethanol in the SCE drying of zinc borates is an important result which can be utilized in the production of boric acid from water insoluble natural minerals, e.g. colemanite. The boric acid\u2013ethanol solution could be directly utilized in the synthesis of ethyl borate.",

Different pre-treatments (initial humidity and milling) and operational conditions (pressure, temperature, time and flow rate) were studied in a CO2 continuous flow laboratory-scale unit. While prior wetting of the coffee husks was needed, milling was not required to extract the caffeine. The use of higher flow rates and/or operational times resulted in higher extraction rates. The process was favoured with increased operational pressure and temperature due to higher solubility. The maximum extraction yield obtained of this alkaloid was 84% when working at 373\u00a0K and 300\u00a0bar, using 197\u00a0kg CO2/kg husks. After water washing, the caffeine was at least 94% pure. Comparing world production data, the initial caffeine content and global extraction yield data of other natural sources, this process could be very advantageous for its technological application.",

Fine valsartan particles from an ethyl acetate (EA) solution were precipitated using compressed CO2 as an antisolvent at low temperature. The EA was considered a proper organic solvent to prevent agglomeration of the prepared valsartan associating to the solubility parameters of the solvents. Ultra fine valsartan particles with a mean diameter of 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm were obtained without excessive agglomeration at the subcritical CO2 of 70\u00a0bar and 5\u00a0\u00b0C. When the supercritical CO2 was at 100\u00a0bar and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, valsartan was precipitated to fine particles that tended to agglomerated due to the melting point depression produced by CO2. During the agglomeration process, particles were sintered by the Ostwald ripening mechanism, which resulted in an increase in particle size. Agglomeration of the particles was shown to be prevented at low temperature, where re-melting of the precipitated valsartan particles is minimized. Hence, processed valsartan with compressed CO2 at a low temperature improved its dissolution rate due to the small size of the particles attributing to low level of particle agglomeration.",

The influence of feed flow, injection temperature and diameter and length of the injector has been evaluated by studying the temperature profiles along the reactor, the total organic carbon (TOC) removal and the extinction temperatures at different conditions. It was possible to inject reactants even at room temperature into the hydrothermal flame with organic destruction efficiencies higher than 99.9%, presenting better operational results than other reactors constructed by our research work.

Feeds containing up to 2.5\u00a0wt% Na2SO4 could be injected in the reactor without plugging problems and a TOC removal of 99.7% was achieved in these conditions.

The optimum operating conditions were determined from the results of a study of the influence of the process parameters, as well as an investigation into the size of the operating range. The results showed that the optimum temperature is a balance between good separation at lower temperatures and better control at higher temperatures. The solvent-to-feed ratio should be kept low (within the range of vapour-continuous operation) as lower solvent-to-feed ratios result in improved separation, as well as lower energy requirements. The use of reflux is necessary for good separation when using carbon dioxide as solvent, but is not required with ethane as solvent. An analysis of the operating range showed that a process using ethane is easier to control. Ethane as solvent is technically superior to carbon dioxide yet, depending on the exact process and location, costs, safety and logistics may favour the use of carbon dioxide.",

The activation energies and reaction activation volumes of the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), and those of the individual components (C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, and C18:2 methyl esters), were calculated. The entropies of activation (\u0394S\u2021) of the transesterification reactions were also obtained. As the transesterification of vegetable oil in supercritical methanol included a strongly negative (\u2212175\u00a0J/mol\u00a0K) entropy of activation, transesterification required harsh conditions.",

Working with a lab-scale bioreactor in mild conditions \u2013 25\u00a0\u00b0C and pressures up to 8\u00a0MPa \u2013 we monitored \u2013 for the first time during pressurization \u2013 cytoplasmic pH variations of Listeria innocua labeled with pH-sensitive fluorophores based on fluorescein.We show that carbonic acid, due to solubilization of CO2 into the aqueous phase, causes a rapid pH drop in the cytosol, reaching pH 4.8 at 1\u00a0MPa and falls below the detection limit of the indicator fluorophore of pH 4.0. This correlates with a reduced viability (below 90%) in all the pressure ranges investigated. Contrarily, treatment under N2O pressure reduces cell viability without significant pH-drop neither of intra- nor extra-cellular liquid at any pressure investigated. The pH value remains between 7 and 6 while an inactivation of more than 80% is achieved at 8\u00a0MPa.Our data clearly demonstrate that, as a critical pressure is achieved, microbial inactivation is mainly due to pressure-induced membrane permeation \u2013 stimulated by non-acidifying fluids as well, rather then cytoplasmic acidification, as widely argued so far.

The recently proposed EOS that combines SAFT with the cohesive term of cubic EOS (SAFT\u00a0+\u00a0Cubic) most likely satisfies this criterion. According to this model, the saturated liquid densities at Tr\u00a0=\u00a00.4 are approximately 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 times smaller than the densities predicted at the infinity pressure. With this ratio SAFT\u00a0+\u00a0Cubic yields reliable density estimations as far as the substances remain liquid (stable or metastable) in all the considered cases.

Cosolvent effect parameter, which is defined as the ratio of diffusion coefficient with and without cosolvent, respectively, is introduced to quantitatively compare the strength of different types of interaction between solute and cosolvent, especially hydrogen bonding. For cosolvent without hydrogen-bond ability, the cosolvent effect parameter decreases with the increase of molecular volume and weight of the solutes, in that the strength of dispersion force with cosolvent increases with their size. For cosolvent with only HBA basicity, the solute with higher HBD acidity has smaller cosolvent effect parameter, due to the fact that the strength of hydrogen-bond interaction between the solute and cosolvent only depends on and increases with the HBD acidity of the solute. For amphiprotic cosolvent, the solute with higher HBD acidity has smaller cosolvent effect parameter, it can be inferred from which that HBD acidity rather than HBA basicity of the solute makes a major contribution to the hydrogen-bond interaction between solute and cosolvent. These results are consistent with the interpretation by the Kamlet\u2013Taft solvatochromic parameters (HBD acidity and HBA basicity). Moreover, a nonlinear decrease in diffusion coefficient with the increase of cosolvent concentration is observed, which is typical of the behavior of the system with strong interaction.",

In order to realistically represent turbulence\u2013chemistry interactions, detailed chemical kinetics, and non-ideal thermodynamic behaviors related to the liquid rocket combustion at supercritical pressures, the flamelet approach is coupled with real-fluid modeling based on the Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013Kwong (SRK) equation of state. To validate the real-fluid flamelet model, a gaseous hydrogen/cryogenic liquid oxygen coaxial jet flame at supercritical pressure has been chosen as a benchmark case. Numerical results are compared with experimental data obtained for the OH radical and the temperature distribution. It was found that weak flow recirculation is induced by the sudden expansion of cold core cryogenic oxygen associated with the pseudo-boiling process. This weak recirculation zone substantially influences the fundamental characteristics of liquid propellant reacting flows at supercritical pressures in terms of the spreading and the flame length. For the flame conditions employed in this study, the predicted contours of the OH radical are in good agreement with the experimental Abel transformed emission image in terms of the flame spreading angle and the flame location.

The restructuring of NbO6 octahedrons was found to be a primary factor in the mechanism of KNbO3 crystallization in high-temperature aqueous environments. Two different crystallization routes exist depending on the conditions of water. The ion product of water affects whether the restructuring of edge-sharing NbO6 octahedrons to corner-sharing NbO6 octahedrons proceeds directly or stepwise according to the degree of dehydration. The direct crystallization route provides polygonal-shaped KNbO3 particles via direct restructuring, namely, homogenous nucleation from supercritical water that is strongly correlated with a low ion product. The stepwise crystallization route provides irregularly shaped KNbO3 particles via restructuring in stages to produce an intermediate K4Nb6O17 phase that is correlated with a high ion product. As the ion product of water decreases in high-temperature water, the stability of crystalline phase is in order of KNbO3\u00a0>\u00a0K4Nb6O17\u00a0>\u00a0K4Nb6O17\u00b73H2O\u00a0>\u00a0defect pyrochlore due to the suppression of dehydration. Water acts to not only dominate the restructuring mechanism of NbO6 octahedrons but also to provide efficient transport of K+ and OH\u2212 ions that allows rapid restructuring of NbO6 octahedrons during KNbO3 crystallization.",

As a comparison, the instantaneous corrosion rate in the early stages for iron in the same corrosion environment was measured by resistance relaxation method. Surface analyzes using SEM/EDS, XRD and XPS were applied to study the morphology and chemical composition of the corroded sample surface. Weight-loss method results showed that the corrosion rate of X70 steel samples increased with SO2 concentration, while the corrosion rate increased before decreasing with SO2 concentration for iron sample. Comparing resistance relaxation method results with weight-loss method results, it is found that the instantaneous corrosion rate of iron is much higher than the uniform corrosion rate of the iron tablet specimens which are covered with thick corrosion product films after a long period of corrosion. The corrosion product films were mainly composed of FeSO4 and FeSO3 hydrates. The possible reaction mechanism under such environment was also analyzed, and the electrochemical reaction between the dissolved SO2 in the condensed water film with iron is the critical reaction step.",

     "abstract": "In this work, supercritical antisolvent micronization (SAS) is used to produce nanoparticles, microparticles and expanded microparticles of a model compound, gadolinium acetate (GdAc), using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as the liquid solvent with the aim of studying the dependence of particles\u2019 diameter and morphology on some process parameters like pressure, temperature and concentration of the starting solution. Experiments are performed varying the precipitation pressure between 90 and 200\u00a0bar, the precipitation temperature between 35 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C and the concentration of GdAc in the liquid solution in the range from 20 to 300\u00a0mg/mL. The experimental evidences show that the formation of particles with specific sizes in the micrometric and nanometric range depends on specific values of each one of these parameters. An explanation of the results is proposed in terms of the competition between two characteristic times of the SAS process that can control the precipitation process. The time of jet break-up of the liquid solution that produces liquid droplet formation, and the dynamic surface tension vanishing time, that induces gas mixing with the precipitation of nanoparticles from the gaseous phase. Indeed, GdAc sub-microparticle, or microparticle (diameter in the range 0.23\u20131.6\u00a0\u03bcm with mean diameters in the range 0.28\u20130.52\u00a0\u03bcm) formation can be attributed to micro-droplet drying, whereas nanoparticles (mean diameter in the range 90\u2013210\u00a0nm) are consistently produced when gas mixing is the possible governing process. In conclusion, the precipitation mechanisms can be modulated varying one SAS parameter a time, thus selecting the range of particle diameters required for the specific application.",

The antisolvent (CO2) is mixed with the solute-containing solution in a small volume mixer immediately before the nozzle orifice in conditions such that cause the precipitation of the solutes. The generated suspension is then spray-dried for solvent separation. Compared to other similar particle-producing techniques, this approach allows a more efficient control of the antisolvent process and reduces the volume of the high-pressure precipitator by several orders of magnitude. Theophylline (TPL) particles produced by ASAIS are the polymorph previously obtained elsewhere by conventional SAS. Yet, the normal (non-polymorph) crystal form is obtained under non-antisolvent conditions. The required phase equilibria of the system TPL/tetrahydrofuran/CO2 between 308\u00a0K and 328\u00a0K were also obtained.

This paper considers the criteria of minimum work of compression, equal discharge temperatures at the exit of each stage and minimum exergy loss during inter-stage and gas cooling for identifying inter-stage pressure. It is shown that the equality of stage discharge temperatures is a more useful criterion than the saving in power or improvement in COP because multi-staging has at best a marginal (<10%) effect on the latter. The criterion of minimal exergy loss in heat rejection also yields the same inter-stage pressures as the minimum work criterion. Optimum inter-stage pressure for each condition is identified for several evaporator and gas cooler outlet temperatures and expressed in terms of the inter-stage pressure index of the product of cycle operating pressure limits.",

In particular our attention was focused on the selectivity toward triglycerides, and in a subsequent extraction of the phospholipids present in the yeast. Indeed CO2 is a non-polar solvent and is not an efficient solvent for the extraction of phospholipids. However, SCCO2 can be used to extract neutral lipids, as triglycerides, and the addition of polar co-solvents like ethanol, at different compositions, allows a more efficient extraction of triglycerides, and also an extraction\u2013fractionation of phospholipids.

As most of the transformers in Korea were contaminated at very low level of less than 5\u00a0ppm, it was decided that SCWO (supercritical water oxidation) process is suitable to treat them.The destroying parameters of SCWO process including optimum process temperature, pressure, residence time, and amount of oxidant were studied with a bench-scale facility. Based on these results and simulation, a pilot plant was designed and built to confirm the suggested condition. Recently detail design of a commercial plant was completed based on these results. In this paper, the procedures to scale up the design from a bench-scale facility to a commercial plant and major check points in each stage are introduced.",

Polymeric materials with molecular recognition to flufenamic acid, were first synthesized in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) using the drug as template. Molecularly imprinted co-polymers of methacrylic acid (MAA) or N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAm) crosslinked with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) were synthesized using different crosslinking degrees and template:monomer ratios, at 65\u00a0\u00b0C and 21\u00a0MPa. High-pressure NMR experiments confirmed that the nature of the interactions between the drug and the functional monomers during the polymerization step are mainly hydrogen bonds. scCO2-assisted impregnation revealed that the imprinted matrices were able to uptake higher amounts of flufenamic acid. This effect was particularly evidenced in the more crosslinked matrices, with P(MAA\u2013EGDMA) imprinted copolymers binding up to 101.5\u00a0mg drug/g polymer against only 50.5\u00a0mg/g in the non-imprinted copolymer. In vitro drug delivery experiments showed that imprinted co-polymers release the drug in a more sustained way than the corresponding non-imprinted matrices. Overall it was shown that supercritical fluid technology is a viable approach for the development of self-assembly molecular recognition polymers with potential application in controlled drug delivery systems.",

The foaming process was performed in the 37\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C temperature range, melting point of PCL being 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The saturation pressure, in the range from 10 to 20\u00a0MPa, and the foaming time, from 2 to 900\u00a0s, were modulated in order to control the final morphology, porosity and pore structure of the foams and, possibly, to amplify the original differences among the different samples.The results of this study demonstrated that by the scCO2 foaming it was possible to produce PCL and PCL-HA foams with homogeneous morphologies at relatively low temperatures.

Triblock (styrene-co-butadiene-co-methylmethacrylate SBM, methylmethacrylate-co-butylacrylate-co-methylmethacrylate MAM) terpolymers were blended to PS or PMMA by extrusion. They showed advantages compared to classical PS-PMMA polymer blends in terms of cell size control and reduction of cell size. Foaming is carried out on bulk injection molded samples which were saturated under high pressures of CO2 (300\u00a0bars) at different temperatures (25\u00b0 C to 80\u00a0\u00b0C) and different depressurization rates (pressure drop rates from 150\u00a0bar/min to 12\u00a0bar/min). Very distinct cellular structures and densities were controlled by varying either the copolymer type or the foaming conditions (T,P). Cell sizes ranged from 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm to 200\u00a0\u03bcm, and densities from 0.30\u00a0g/cm3 to 1\u00a0g/cm3 in the polymers considered. Particularly, when triblock copolymers were able to self organize (nanostructuring) in a polymer matrix, they became phase separated at a nanometer level, presenting nanostructured polymers matrixes. To conclude the study, a possible nanostructuring mechanism is suggested based on the interplay between rubbery and highly CO2-philic blocks/rigid and less CO2-philic blocks.

     "abstract": "Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis processes are of interest for the manufacture of nanoparticle metal oxides. In such processes, nanoparticle nuclei (in a slurry) which are initially formed, may continue to grow and agglomerate to generate larger particles as they pass through the synthesis apparatus. These processes can widen the size distribution and also affect the ultimate particle shape in the recovered product. Therefore, fast cooling or quenching the initial nanoparticle slurry using a highly efficient heat exchanger may minimise or stop further crystallisation/agglomeration processes. This may be achieved by optimising the design of the heat exchanger based on detailed examination of flow patterns and heat transfer profiles using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling approach. The predicted flow and heat transfer patterns in the heat exchanger can also provide detailed information for the identification of any heat transfer deterioration or hot spots where further reactions may occur. This paper employs a CFD modelling approach to simulate the heat transfer processes in a tubular heat exchanger of a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis system and also to examine the effect of various operating conditions, including inlet temperature and flowrate of hot slurry and inlet flowrate of cooling water, on the fluid and thermal features in the heat exchanger. The simulated results show that the predicted temperature and heat transfer coefficient are in good agreement with experimental measurements.",

     "abstract": "The impact of side chain and midblock length on the solubility of ABA triblock copolymers of fluorooxetane-(ethylene oxide)-fluorooxetane in carbon dioxide is examined. The use of short fluorinated side chains instead of long fluorinated chains prevents issues with bioaccumulation of the degradation products of the surfactant. At 40\u00a0\u00b0C for the same degree of polymerization, increasing the number of perfluoro-units from one to four results in a non-monotonic change in the cloud point pressure; the cloud point pressure decreases as the side chain is increased from perfluoromethyl to perfluoroethyl. However, further increasing the fluorinated side chain to perfluorobutyl results in a significant increase in the cloud point. However when the temperature is increased to 60\u00a0\u00b0C, the cloud point pressure for the surfactants with perfluoroethyl and perfluorobutyl side chains is statistically similar, while the perfluoromethyloxetane based surfactant requires a substantially larger pressure to obtain comparable solubility. An increase in cloud point pressure is observed when increasing the hydrophilic ethylene oxide segment. These results illustrate that commercially available fluorooxetane-(ethylene oxide)-fluorooxetane surfactants are highly soluble in CO2.",

     "abstract": "The chemical conversion of detergent range alkanes (12\u201314 carbon atoms) to alcohols is often incomplete and results in a large amount of residual alkane. This paper shows that these alkanes and alcohols can be separated by supercritical fluids. Ethane, propane and carbon dioxide were selected as possible supercritical solvents while n-tetradecane and 1-dodecanol were selected to represent the alkane\u2013alcohol mixture, as these would be the two most difficult compounds to separate in a C12 to C14 alkane\u2013alcohol mixture. A phase behaviour study and relative solubility analysis revealed that both ethane and carbon dioxide show promise in separating n-tetradecane and 1-dodecanol. Propane was eliminated as possible solvent because the phase behaviour of n-tetradecane and 1-dodecanol in supercritical propane is too similar. A pilot plant study showed that both supercritical ethane and carbon dioxide can be used to separate n-tetradecane and 1-dodecanol, with indications that supercritical ethane may affect a superior separation. An economic analysis, considering the energy requirements, revealed that the most important parameter with regard to energy consumption is the solvent-to-feed ratio. The process utilising ethane is more energy intensive, yet the energy requirements for both processes compare well with other petrochemical separation processes using supercritical fluids. Further investigations with both ethane and carbon dioxide should be conducted to determine which of these two solvents are superior and to optimise the operating parameters.",

In this work, the phase equilibrium of Oleoresin Capsicum in supercritical carbon dioxide was measured by a recirculation method at pressures between 90 and 315\u00a0bar and temperatures of 314.7, 326.4 and 337.8\u00a0K.

Moreover, the prediction of the pseudo-binary system CO2/Oleoresin Capsicum was carried out with the Group Contribution Equation of State (GC-EoS), using the set of binary group parameters established in a previous work. For all isotherms studied, the solubility of Oleoresin Capsicum in the gaseous phase and that of CO2 in the liquid phase increases with an increase in pressure. Comparison between experimental data and those correlated by SRK or predicted by GC-EoS, shows that SRK correlation produced better fittings of the experimental data. Nevertheless, the importance of data predicted by GC-EoS is based on the possibility to obtain an approximation to the thermodynamic behaviour of the real systems without the necessity of experimental data.",

One major challenge in the realization of this novel technique is the entrainment of comparatively cool, aqueous drilling fluid by the hot water jet, which can lead to significant heat losses before the hot jet's energy can be transferred to the rock. The present work quantifies such entrainment effects by determining penetration lengths of supercritical water jets injected into a cool, subcritical environment using a novel optical Schlieren method. Penetration lengths of supercritical jets were found to be equal to the injector's nozzle diameter and almost independent of the jet's temperature at the nozzle exit and the jet's mass flow under almost all experimental conditions investigated. A semi-empirical model adapted from steam jet studies confirmed these findings and indicates that heat and mass transfer are primarily controlled by turbulent mixing.",

Besides, if an enrichment of carotenoids and capsaicinoids is reached, many applications in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry can be covered by the products obtained. In this work, the fractionation of oleoresin capsicum using supercritical CO2 countercurrent extraction was studied to obtain an extract enriched in capsaicinoids and a raffinate enriched in carotenoids. Moreover, the separation column was designed. Phase equilibrium of the system CO2\u2013oleoresin capsicum was determined along the interval of temperature (314\u2013338\u00a0K) and pressures (90\u2013310\u00a0bar), and samples of both phases were analytically characterized.

At 337.8\u00a0K and 206\u00a0bar a maximum selectivity of 5.6 between the pseudocompound enriched in capsaicinoids and the pseudocompound enriched in carotenoids was obtained. This fact showed that countercurrent gas separation could be employed and could be economically interesting.

Such loci generally exist over a wide range of conditions. The method is able to track SFF lines of varying shape and degree of non-linearity. When building a curve for which, as in the case of a SFF curve, every point is defined by a non-linear system of equations, NCMs have the ability of selecting, among the variables involved, the optimum one, i.e., the variable that should be specified for calculating the next point on the curve. The initial guess for such next point is, when using NCMs, more sophisticated than simply setting it equal to the previously converged point of the curve. These features of NCMs make possible to track complete SFF lines with minimum user intervention. Among other algorithms, we propose in this work a procedure to obtain SFF lines that have been previously regarded as difficult to compute due to the very low concentration of the heavy component of the binary asymmetric system in either fluid phase. We illustrate the use of the present algorithms for a model that uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS) for the fluid phases, and an equation that relates the fugacity of the pure heavy component with pressure and temperature. We do not consider in this work the precipitation of the light component.",

Our systematic approach indicates the optimum conditions of supercritical CO2 extraction were obtained as follows: 35\u00a0MPa, 40\u00a0\u00b0C, ethanol (95%, v/v) as the co-solvent, and the mass ratio of material to co-solvent 1:1. Under these conditions, 33.9% of lipid yield and 27.5% of DHA content were achieved. Despite the relatively low lipid yield, supercritical CO2 extraction has exhibited many advantages over the Soxhlet extraction for the DHA enrichment such as high DHA purity and superb product quality. Furthermore, urea complexation method on DHA enrichment considerably increased the DHA purity from 29.7% to 60.4% with an enrichment ratio of 60.6%, under the optimum complexation conditions of urea/fatty acid 2:1, complexation time 8\u00a0h, and the complexation temperature of \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C.",

     "abstract": "In this study, the hydrothermal gasification of biomass in supercritical water is investigated. The work is of peculiar value since a real biomass, olive mill wastewater (OMW), is used instead of model biomass compounds. OMW is a by-product obtained during olive oil production, which has a complex nature characterized by a high content of organic compounds and polyphenols. The high content of organics makes OMW a desirable biomass candidate as an energy source. The hydrothermal gasification experiments for OMW were conducted with five different reaction temperatures (400, 450, 500, 550 and 600\u00a0\u00b0C) and five different reaction times (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150\u00a0s), under a pressure of 25\u00a0MPa. The gaseous products are mainly composed of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and C1\u2013C4 hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, propane and propylene. Maximum amount of the gas product obtained is 7.71\u00a0mL per mL OMW at a reaction temperature of 550\u00a0\u00b0C, with a reaction time of 30\u00a0s. The gas product composition is 9.23% for hydrogen, 34.84% for methane, 4.04% for ethane, 0.84% for propane, 0.83% for propylene, 49.34% for carbon dioxide, and 0.88% for minor components such as n-butane, i-butane, 1-butene, i-butene, t-2-butene, 1,3-butadiene and nitrogen at this reaction conditions.",

Hydrogen was the main product accompanied with relatively low amounts of carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide. Some liquid products, such as acetaldehyde and, occasionally, methanol were present. The ethanol conversion and hydrogen yield and selectivity increased substantially as the water to ethanol ratio and the reaction temperature increased. Ethanol was almost completely reformed and mainly converted to hydrogen giving a H2/CO ratio of 2.6 at 550\u00a0\u00b0C and water to ethanol ratio of 30 without carbon formation. Coke deposition was favored at low water to ethanol ratio, especially at high temperatures (\u2265550\u00a0\u00b0C). The hydrogen yield improved as the ethanol was partially oxidized by the oxygen added into the feed at oxygen to ethanol ratios <0.071. It was evidenced that the metal components in Inconel 625 reactor wall reduced by a hydrogen stream acted as a catalyst promoting hydrocarbon reforming as well as water\u2013gas-shift reactions while dehydrogenation of ethanol forming acetaldehyde can proceed homogeneously under the SCW condition. However, at high oxygen to ethanol ratio, the reactor wall was gradually deactivated after being exposed to the oxidant in the feed. The loss of the catalytic activity of the reactor surface was mainly due to the metal oxide formation resulting in reduction of catalytic activity of the reactor wall and reforming of carbon species was no longer promoted.",

This work is focused in the two-step foaming process, in which the sample is previously saturated under ScCO2 being expanded in a second step out of the CO2 vessel (e.g. in a hot oil bath) where foaming is initiated by the change of temperature near or above the glass transition temperature of the glass/polymer glassy system. Samples were saturated under high pressures of CO2 (300\u00a0bar), at room temperature, for 16\u00a0h, followed by a quenching at a high depressurization rate (150\u00a0bar/min).

A laboratory scale equipment (290\u00a0mL extraction vessel) and a pilot scale equipment (5.15\u00a0L extraction vessel) were used to study scale-up of SFE for clove and sugarcane residue. The scale-up criterion adopted consisted in maintaining solvent mass to feed mass ratio constant. The criterion was successfully used for a 15-fold scale-up of overall extraction curves for both raw materials studied; yields in pilot scale were slightly higher than in laboratory scale.

Both extracts killed concentration-dependently the MCF-7 cells in culture, although the SFE extract presented superior cytotoxic activity. The SFE presented IC50\u00a0=\u00a0437 (428\u2013446)\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in 24\u00a0h of incubation, decreasing to IC50\u00a0=\u00a0291 (282\u2013299)\u00a0\u03bcg/mL at 48\u00a0h. The HCE started causing DNA cleavage at 160\u00a0\u03bcg/mL while the SFE extract started at 40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, a concentration enough to initiate the in vitro cleavage. The presence of polyacetylenes as the major compounds in SFE was confirmed by TL chromatography combined with UV\u2013vis analyses.

Important operating variables like temperature, pressure, extraction time, solvent flow rate and particle size influencing the extraction efficiency were investigated in detail.

For this purpose it was employed two microtube reactors with different internal diameter, 0.775 and 0.571\u00a0mm. The experiments were performed in the temperature range of 523\u2013598\u00a0K, pressure of 10\u00a0MPa and 20\u00a0MPa, oil to ethanol molar ratio of 1:20 and 1:40, and co-solvent to substrates mass ratio from 0.05:1 to 0.2:1. Results demonstrated that temperature, pressure and co-solvent to substrate mass ratio had a positive effect on fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) production, with appreciable yields achieved at 598\u00a0K, 20\u00a0MPa, oil to ethanol molar ratio of 1:20, using a CO2 to substrate mass ratio of 0.2:1. The micro-reactor with the smallest inner diameter led to slightly higher FAEE yields at the specified reactions conditions compared to the micro-reactor with greater internal diameter.

For the micronization of the polymer the particles from gas saturated solutions (PGSS) process is used. Several applications require specific particle shapes and particle size distributions. In particular, spherical particles are required to obtain a free flowing powder. To optimise the quality, powders were produced at different spray temperatures and pressures and with varying mass flows of polymer and gas. With different spray conditions, powders with various shapes, morphologies and apparent densities were obtained. The temperatures before and after the expansion appear to have the main influence on the sphericity. To obtain further knowledge about the solidification process, the temperature distribution in the spray was analysed. For this purpose, heat images of the spray were taken. Based on the results, a simple model is introduced, which is able to estimate the temperature field in a polymer droplet during the spray process.

Moreover, water contact angle measurements, pure water permeability and filtration experiments were performed to evaluate membrane hydrophilicity and fouling resistance properties. Permeation experiments of model foulants, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and starch solutions were used to investigate antifouling character of blend membranes at different pHs. PAN:PAN-g-PEO (70:30) showed to be the ultrafiltration membrane with best performance.

In the present approach, turbulence is represented by an extended k\u2013\u025b turbulence model. A conserved scalar approach together with a presumed probability density function approach is utilized to account for scalar fluctuation effects on the turbulent mixing processes of real fluids over transcritical and supercritical states. The two real-fluid equations of state (EOS) and dense-fluid correction schemes incorporated into our real-fluid code are validated for thermodynamic and transport properties over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. In this study, computations are made for four cryogen nitrogen jets at near-critical and supercritical pressures. Special emphasis is given to sensitivity analyses for two different equations of state. Based on our numerical results, the real fluid behaviors and precise structures of cryogenic nitrogen jets are discussed in detail. Numerical results indicate that the present real-fluid model has the predicative capabilities to simulate the essential features of the cryogenic liquid nitrogen jets. The PR equation predicts the slightly better conformity with measured nitrogen density profiles, compared to the SRK equation. It is also found that increases in pseudo-boiling strength result in increases in the cold potential core length as well as decreases in the decay rate of the axial velocity.",

Cluster size is limited in two dimensions by the pore size of the support but clusters grow larger with increasing impregnation time and turn into small nanowires. The catalytic activity of the Pd/SiO2 composite material was confirmed following the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in water by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy.",

     "abstract": "Supercritical CO2 has many unusual physicochemical properties in or near the critical region, which is mostly due to the local density enhancements and specific molecular interactions. Compared to pure CO2, the study on CO2 mixed with co-solvent is attractive in wide applications but it is hard to quantitatively describe the local density change and intermolecular clusters in CO2 mixtures. The fluorescence response of a sensitive pyrene probe, empirical Py scale, was determined in CO2 mixed with pentane at 323.15\u00a0K in different phase regions. A variable called the order parameter was introduced to account for possible correlations in the first derivative of Py scale and fluid pressure (dPy/(d(P/P0\u00a0\u2212\u00a01))). This model, avoiding the hard choice of the reference line in CO2 mixtures, was effective in calculating the local density change and it showed the specific molecular interaction in the critical region. The behaviors of the local density change and the isothermal compressibility of supercritical CO2 mixtures correlated well with microscopic and macroscopic observations.",

This model may easily be applied to different reactor configurations. The theoretical results and the goodness of the fit has been verified using the experimental results showing a good accuracy of the complex phenomena with a simplification that is of vital relevance for technical processes.",

     "abstract": "Experimental data from a tubular reactor and from a transpiring wall reactor (TWR) are used to analyze the scaling up of SCWO reactors operating with a hydrothermal flame as a heat source. Results obtained with the tubular reactor show that fluid velocity inside the reactor determines the minimum injection temperature at which a stable hydrothermal flame is formed. When the fluid velocity inside of the reactor is lower, the extinction temperature of the hydrothermal flame in that reactor is also lower. Using this reactor, extinction temperatures are always near or above the critical temperature of water. Total TOC removals are possible working with isopropyl-alcohol at temperatures between 650 and 700\u00a0\u00b0C and residence times of 0.5\u00a0s. Results of the TWR show that steady operation with a hydrothermal flame inside is possible even when reagents are injected at subcritical conditions as low as 170\u00a0\u00b0C. Temperature measurements show that reaction is not initiated in the injector but in the reaction chamber, where fluid velocity is lower than 0.1\u00a0s. This was explained by estimating that the flame front velocity of a hydrothermal flame is of the order of 0.1\u00a0m/s. Thus, it is expected that the flame is stabilized in the reaction chamber and not in the injector, where fluid velocities are higher than 2\u00a0m/s. A previously developed model of the TWR was modified in order to describe the ignition in the reaction chamber and not in the injector. The model reproduces satisfactorily experimental data and it was used to propose the design of scaled up reactors for SCWO with a hydrothermal flame inside.",

Numerous particles precipitated at 251\u00a0\u00b0C, and at 350\u00a0\u00b0C, all the glucose changed to an orange film and solid particles, which were nanoparticles as confirmed by SEM.

A homogeneous phase with yellow color still remained at temperatures as high as 380\u00a0\u00b0C, and few particles formed until 410\u00a0\u00b0C. It can be concluded that micron-sized particles and colored solutions can be produced by slow heating, while rapid heating resulted in the formation of dye-like substances with glucose-like structures.

These degradation products could be quantified chromatographically by the above standard because the area of the peak was proportional to the disappearance of the polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters, which contain two or more double bonds (methyl linoleate and linolenate), generated during biodiesel synthesis from soybean oil. In the experimental conditions tested, thermal decomposition reactions of these unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters began to appear at 300\u00a0\u00b0C/26\u00a0MPa, and were more intense as the temperature rose.

The Pt nanoparticles in an RFA pellet had a uniform radial size distribution, even though the pellet was impregnated with Pt(cod)me2 for too short a short period of time for the system to reach adsorption equilibrium. The high mobility of the atomic Pt evolved during the reduction process is believed to be responsible for this phenomenon.

These families constitute a series of non-self associating, associating and cross-associating components whose potential associative interactions with CO2 are evaluated here.A detailed investigation regarding the differing behavior of CO2 depending on the nature of the second component and how the CPA EoS can best describe them is presented here, namely explicitly considering the CO2 association and also evaluating also its different association schemes.It will be shown that it is important to consider CO2 self- and cross-association to describe the VLE of n-alkane and small alcohol/CO2 systems. However, it is not necessary to consider CO2 association when dealing with systems of heavy alcohols, esters or acids.The CPA EoS provides very good results for the extensive range of CO2 binary systems considered here using, for most of them, single, small, temperature independent, positive and chain length dependent binary interaction parameters.",

Consequently, we present a mathematical modeling study of the extraction of essential oil from khoa. The overall extraction curves (OECs) obtained for khoa oil were modeled considering the mass transfer based on local equilibrium between solvent and a solid. The influence of pressure and co-solvent on the extraction kinetics was evaluated using a mathematical modeling. The model was solved numerically and validated with experimental data. A novel method for calculating the initial mass fraction of khoa-extract is proposed; data of the proposed model are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, the influence of fluid flow rate and particle size has been studied on the extraction efficiency.

A lower melting point (160\u00a0\u00b0C) was observed in the case of co-crystals and the exothermic peaks were missing for pure CBZ and co-crystals when they were complexed with CD. The absence of the melting peaks indicates complete complexation.

     "abstract": "Due to their high surface area, low density, open pore structure and excellent insulation properties aerogels are intensively investigated since the past decades for a diverse range of applications. The current methods of silica aerogel production by supercritical extraction produce monolithic aerogels, where the sol is aged in molds and dried by extraction with supercritical CO2. Aerogels in the form of spherical microparticles would be beneficial for many applications, for instance, drug delivery for respiratory route; or as insulating materials. However, because of aerogel's mechanical properties, it is difficult, rather impossible, to obtain spherical microparticles by milling or crushing of the monolithic aerogels. This work presents a new method to produce biocompatible spherical aerogel microparticles using an emulsion technique (in situ production) followed by supercritical extraction of the resulted dispersion (gel\u2013oil). Water in oil emulsion was produced by mixing the sol (dispersed phase) with a vegetable oil (continuous phase) followed by the gelation of the dispersed phase. The size distribution of the final gel particles was found to be influenced by agitation, surfactant concentration and sol:oil volume ratios. The gel\u2013oil dispersion was subsequently extracted with supercritical CO2, Silica aerogel spherical microparticles with a surface area of 1100\u00a0m2g\u22121, pore volume of 3.5\u00a0cm3/g and different mean particle diameters ranging from 200\u00a0\u03bcm to a few millimeters were produced using the presented method.",

It is often thought that the range of applicability of van der Waals-type models is limited to mixtures of compounds relatively similar in size. We employ in this work an approach for investigating the various terms of cubic equations of state by looking at the excess Gibbs energy and activity coefficient expressions which are derived from these equations of state. We illustrate that the results of cubic equations of state are sensitive to the mixing and combining rules used. Moreover, it is shown that previously reported deficiencies for size-asymmetric systems are more related to the van der Waals one fluid mixing rules used rather than the functionality of the cubic equation of state itself. Improved models for polar systems have been developed using the so-called EoS/GE mixing rules and we illustrate with the same methodology how these mixing rules should best be used for size-asymmetric systems. Despite the significant capabilities of cubic equations of state, their limitations lie especially in the description of complex phase behavior, e.g. liquid\u2013liquid equilibria for highly polar and/or hydrogen bonding containing molecules. In these cases, advanced equations of state based on statistical mechanics that incorporate ideas from perturbation (e.g. SAFT and CPA), chemical (e.g. APACT) and lattice (e.g. NRHB) theories are preferred. Some of the most promising approaches are briefly outlined here. Their capabilities and limitations/challenges, pointing out to future research needs are also discussed.",

For the description of the required distribution coefficients or separation factors, reliable thermodynamic models are required. For a long time, the application of gE-models as well as group contribution methods was most popular. However, equations of state show a lot of advantages compared to gE-models.

Fluid molecules were assumed spherical, interacting with each other and with the walls of cylindrical pores through distinct square-well potentials. It was found that our model may predict either one or two mechanically stable critical points for the confined fluid, depending on its specifications. When two critical points are predicted, one is attributed to a major contribution of molecule\u2013molecule interactions and the other to a major contribution of molecule\u2013wall interactions. The confined fluid critical point(s) presented a complex dependence on the pore size, due to the interplay of molecule\u2013molecule and molecule\u2013wall interactions.

     "abstract": "The poor dissolution behaviour of solid drugs in biological environment leads to a low bioavailability. However, the dissolution rate of such drugs can be enhanced dramatically by reduction of the particle size. At present, supercritical fluid based particle size reduction processes are gaining in importance in pharmaceutical technology. For the design of such particle formation processes and the determination of their best operating conditions the knowledge of phase equilibrium and solute solubility in a supercritical fluid is essential. Today, models based on equations of state, together with different mixing rules, are most widely used to correlate and predict the solubility in supercritical fluids. Therefore the accurate knowledge of the required solute data, such as critical parameters, acentric factor, solid molar volume, and sublimation pressure of the solutes is essential. However, the common, non-equation of state based group-contribution methods are mostly empirical and often lead to inconsistent and unreliable results. Thus, due to the lack of information on these data, density-based models are often used for the correlation of experimental solubility data. In this investigation, the solubility of Salicylic acid, of S-Naproxen, of RS-Ibuprofen and of Phytosterol in CO2 is correlated by different methods: two methods for the pressure\u2013solubility correlation and two methods for the density\u2013solubility correlation. In addition, the influence of solute data predicted by different group-contribution methods is investigated. With the exception of S-Naproxen all systems investigated can be modelled sufficient well with a non-cubic equation of state while a cubic equation of state gives less accurate results. In addition, it is shown that for the solutes investigated, the equation of state based method is very sensitive to the values of the sublimation pressure.",

At this temperature, neither the third- nor fourth-order VEOS indicate the presence of a critical point for the mixture. However, the VEOS coupled with an ideal-solution treatment for the coexisting subcritical fluid phase (with parameters determined from coexistence data at one pressure) reproduces much of the solubility curve as previously established by Gibbs-ensemble molecular simulation. Comparison of the third- and fourth-order VEOS indicate that the virial treatment is converged at the conditions where it is applied.",

The concentration dependency of the density and dielectric permittivity was taken into account in describing the electrostatic contribution that is required for thermodynamic consistency of the results of modeling. A method of assessing the appropriate relationships for mixtures containing supercritical components is suggested, alongside with the way to estimate the \u201ctrue\u201d composition of mixtures where ionic species are formed due to chemical reactions.

Experimental work refers to gravimetric surface excess adsorption measurements of each gas studied in this nanomaterial. Commercial samples of pristine SWCNTs, systematically prepared and characterized at first, were used for the evaluation of their adsorption capacity. A Langmuir type equation was adopted to estimate the total adsorption isotherm based on the experimental surface excess adsorption data for each system studied. Computational work refers to Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of each adsorbed gas on a SWCNTs model of the type (9, 9) in the grand canonical (GC) ensemble at the same conditions with experiment using Scienomics\u2019 MAPS platform software simulation packages such as Towhee. The GCMC simulation technique was employed to obtain the uptake wt% of each adsorbed gas by considering a SWCNTs model of arrays with parallel tubes exhibiting open-ended cylindrical structures as in experiment. Both experimental and simulation adsorption data concerning these gases within the examined carbon material are presented and discussed in terms of the adsorbate fluid molecular characteristics and corresponding interactions among adsorbate species and adsorbent material. The adsorption isotherms obtained exhibited type I (Langmuir) behavior, providing enhanced gas\u2013substrate interactions. We found that both the experimental as well as the simulated adsorption uptake of the examined SWCNTs at these conditions with regard to the aforementioned fluids and in comparison with adsorbate H2 on the same material increase similarly and in the following order: H2\u00a0\u226a\u00a0N2\u00a0\u2248\u00a0CH4\u00a0<\u00a0CO\u00a0\u226a\u00a0CO2. Furthermore, for each adsorbate fluid the calculations exhibit somewhat greater gas uptake with pressure compared to the corresponding experiment. The difference in the absolute uptake values between experiment and simulation has been discussed and ascribed to the following implicit factors: (i) to the employed model calculations, (ii) to the remained carbonaceous impurities in the sample, and (iii) to a proportion of close ended tubes, contained in the experimental sample even after preparation.",

We propose here a new DFT (the star-function based density functional theory, s-DFT) that is based on the functional Taylor expansion of the intrinsic free energy F[\u03c1] and the singlet direct correlation C w ( 1 ) ( r ) to arrive at closed-form expressions for both quantities without truncations or approximations. The two formulas are mutually consistent because of the introduction of a star function S w that has been shown to be the functional primitive of the bridge function B w , i.e. \u03b4 S w * / \u03b4 \u03c1 = B w (L.L. Lee, J. Chem. Phys. 97 (1992) 8606 [34]). The new formulation is applied to the Lennard-Jones molecules adsorbed on a planar hard wall (LJ/HW). We carried out new Monte Carlo simulations for this system. Since the s-DFT uses a bridge function B w , we demonstrate (i) the existence of a set of data (inverted from the MC information) that can perform as the bridge function and reproduce accurately the density profiles \u03c1 w ( 1 ) ( r ) ; (ii) this set of data can be \u201cfitted\u201d by a function-form with acronym ZSEP; finally (iii) ZSEP expresses the bridge function B w in terms of a new renormalized basis function \u03b3H, i.e. B w ( \u03b3 H ) . The existence of a bridge function dispels some of the misconceptions that the bridge-function based formulations did not describe the \u201cdrying\u201d behavior. We also show that for the high density case ZSEP equation can qualify as a \u201cclosure relation\u201d, but seems to deteriorate for the two low-density supercritical states that are close to the bulk saturated liquid phase boundaries.",

Excess molar enthalpies ( H m E ) for CO2\u00a0+\u00a0DMF mixtures were measured using an isothermal high-pressure flow calorimeter under conditions of temperature and pressure typically used in supercritical processes: 313.15 and 323.15\u00a0K at 9.00, 12.00, 15.00 and 18.00\u00a0MPa and 333.15\u00a0K at 9.00 and 15.00\u00a0MPa. The Peng\u2013Robinson and the Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013Kwong equations of state were used in conjunction with the classical mixing rules to model the literature vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium and critical data and the excess enthalpy data. In most cases, CO2\u00a0+\u00a0DMF mixtures showed very exothermic mixing and excess molar enthalpies exhibited a minimum in the CO2-rich region. The lowest H m E value (\u22124526\u00a0J\u00a0mol\u22121) was observed for a CO2 mole fraction value of 0.713 at 9.00\u00a0MPa and 333.15\u00a0K. On the other hand, H m E at 9.00\u00a0MPa and 323.15 and 333.15\u00a0K varies linearly with CO2 mole fraction in the two-phase region where a gaseous and a liquid mixture of fixed composition are in equilibrium. The effects of pressure and temperature on the excess molar enthalpy are large. For a given mole fraction, mixtures become less exothermic as pressure increases or temperature decreases. These excess enthalpy data were analyzed in terms of molecular interactions, phase equilibria, density and critical parameters previously reported for CO2\u00a0+\u00a0DMF.

The isochoric method provides an indirect way of determining the conditions of phase transitions from the pressure vs. temperature variation of the isochoric lines. The linear variation found both in the homogeneous and the vapor\u2013liquid region of the reacting mixtures allows a clear determination of the transition points at different mixture densities and compositions. The linearity in the vapor\u2013liquid region is also verified by flash computations of the reaction products mixture. The procedure can also be applied to the selection of cosolvents needed to carry out reactions under homogeneous conditions. For this purpose the binaries of methyl oleate, n-octadecane and naphthalene with methanol are also investigated. The colinearity of isochores at the criocondentherm point that has been reported in previous works was also found in the present study.",

They set the basis for a consistent and useful representation of phase equilibria for a great diversity of mixtures. Nevertheless, the models for representing phase equilibria and physico-chemical properties of asymmetric systems may require more flexible mixing rules than the classical quadratic van der Waals (vdW) mixing rules or their equivalent (with regard to the number of available interaction parameters) in modern equations of state.In particular, the phase equilibria of binary mixtures containing CO2 and heavy n-alkanes have been studied by an important number of authors and using different types of models, achieving only partially accurate results and realizing the difficulties that these systems showing type III phase behavior (from C14 on) present for predicting or even correlating their phase equilibrium data in wide ranges of temperature and pressure.Cubic mixing rules (CMRs), implemented as a natural extension of the classical quadratic mixing rules, constitute the simplest alternative among different flexible approaches. In addition, they have the advantage of allowing correlation of multicomponent data by fitting ternary interaction parameters, while leaving invariant the description of the constituent binary systems.In this work, and after having detected the need for temperature-dependent interaction parameters in a previous study, we implemented an automated parameterization procedure based on characteristic key-points for binary systems showing type III phase behavior. Using the RK-PR EoS coupled to CMRs we present the parameters obtained and results showing for the first time a quite successful complete description of asymmetric CO2\u00a0+\u00a0n-alkane binary systems, with n-alkane carbon number from 14 to 22.",

A CO2 captive bubble technique has been developed to measure the interfacial tension \u03b3 at a known surfactant concentration in the aqueous phase, with rapid equilibration at the water\u2013CO2 interface. The surface pressure (\u03b3o\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b3) decreases modestly with density at constant temperature as CO2 solvates the surfactant tails more effectively, but changes little with temperature at constant density.

It was approximately twofold larger than that at the water\u2013air interface, given the much smaller \u03b3o driving force for surfactant adsorption. For systems with added NaCl, \u03b3 decreases with salinity at low CO2 densities as the surfactant partitions from water towards the W\u2013C interface. At high densities, salt drives the surfactant from the W\u2013C interface to CO2 and raises \u03b3. Compared with most hydrocarbon surfactants, this dual tail surfactant is unusually CO2-philic in that it partitions primarily into the CO2 phase versus the water phase at CO2 densities above 0.8\u00a0g/ml, and produces \u03b3 values below 1\u00a0mN/m. With this small \u03b3, a middle phase microemulsion and a C/W microemulsion were formed at low temperatures and high CO2 densities, whereas macroemulsions were formed at other conditions.",

The appeal of the approach is its simple implementation, where the renormalization is treated in a local density approximation (LDA). The model is almost exact at the critical point. Away from the critical point, the model reduces to the perturbed chain statistical associated fluid theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state. The conventional PC-SAFT pure component parameters are supplemented with a single substance-specific renormalization parameter, which is adjusted to reproduce the bulk phase critical temperature.

The storage of carbon dioxide in underground formations is a potential way of mitigating climate change during a transition period to more sustainable energy sources. Combining injection with subsequent trapping of the non-wetting supercritical carbon dioxide phase in the pores of a depleted reservoir is a promising scheme for allowing the continued use of fossil fuels with minimal environmental consequences. The design of such processes is ultimately linked to the confined behaviour of the fluids in question at reservoir conditions, which is largely controlled by interfacial forces. Measurements of the relevant interfacial tensions for systems containing alkanes, carbon dioxide and water are currently limited and inconsistent while models usually fail to capture the pressure dependence of the interfacial tension. In this work, a density functional theory based on the SAFT-VR equation of state was used to predict the interfacial tension of (H2O\u00a0+\u00a0CO2\u00a0+\u00a0n-alkane) binary systems over wide ranges of temperature and pressure.

In this contribution, we present a thermodynamic characterization of fifteen HFCs using the extended soft-SAFT equation of state, including phase equilibria, interfacial tensions and heat capacities. A robust and transferable molecular model was developed for the description of the vapor\u2013liquid equilibria of HFCs including the critical region and interfacial tensions. Interfacial properties were obtained by coupling the crossover soft-SAFT equation with the Density Gradient Theory of van der Waals, while near critical properties could be accurately obtained thanks to the use of a crossover term to take into account the fluctuations in the critical region. Correlations of the molecular parameters with the molecular weight of the compounds allowed predictions for new HFCs without the need of experimental data. Then, the behavior of binary mixtures of blends of refrigerants, commonly used for particular applications, was predicted with high accuracy by the theory when compared to available experimental data, without using binary data. Mixtures of refrigerants with alkanes and carbon dioxide were also investigated, showing the capabilities of the equation to capture the intermolecular interactions in these mixtures in a precise manner. The results obtained give confidence about the transferability of the model to other chemical families using the soft-SAFT equation, and provide a step towards modeling a new generation of refrigerants, such as hydrofluoroethers (HFEs).",

     "abstract": "The accurate knowledge of the thermodynamic properties, with special emphasis on phase equilibria, of aqueous solutions of carbon dioxide is essential from practical and theoretical points of view. These aqueous mixtures are of great interest in different industrial processes, including its use as supercritical solvents, CO2 sequestration technologies and oil enhanced recovery, among many different applications. From a theoretical point of view, this mixture exhibits a variety of interactions, including dispersive forces, hydrogen bonding between water molecules, and also dipolar and quadrupolar electrical interactions, which determine its phase behaviour. In particular, the mixture exhibits type III phase behaviour, which leads to large regions of liquid\u2013liquid immiscibility. In a number of practical situations, it is important to make miscible this mixture. This can effectively be done by adding some amount of a selected surfactant that stabilizes the mixture. An ideal candidate would be a surfactant formed by hydrophilic and CO2-philic parts that interact favourably with water and carbon dioxide molecules, respectively. In this work we study a novel family of diblock amphiphiles, the perfluoroalkyl\u2013polyoxyethylene ether non-ionic diblock surfactants, which have the general formula F(CF2)i(OCH2CH2)jOH or simply FiEj. We employ the sophisticated and versatile Statistical Associating Fluid Theory for potentials of variable range, the so-called SAFT-VR approach, to study the phase behaviour of aqueous solutions of carbon dioxide and the novel surfactants. All molecules are modeled under the united-atom approach, in which different chemical groups are treated as hard-sphere attractive segments. The FiEj surfactant is modelled as a diblock compound, which consists of a perfluorinated alkane chain and a polyoxyethylene ether chain. The optimized molecular parameters for H2O, CO2, and the perfluoroalkyl, polyoxyethylene ether and the rest of chemical groups forming the surfactant are taken from previous works from the literature. Unlike interactions between different chemical groups are carefully chosen to reproduce the phase behaviour of similar associating surfactants previously studied in the literature. In this work we study the effect of temperature, pressure and composition of a selection of mixtures to understand the microscopic conditions that determine the stabilization of aqueous solutions of carbon dioxide when this kind of surfactants are added. To our knowledge, this is the first time the phase behaviour of mixtures containing this kind of surfactants is studied using a microscopic modelling approach.",

This study presents experimental high-pressure solubility data of carbon dioxide in the ionic liquid 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide within the temperature range of 280\u2013370\u00a0K and pressures up to 14\u00a0MPa. The data are compared with those obtained in other laboratories and the differences are not alarming. In addition, a discussion is presented on the carbon dioxide\u00a0+\u00a0ionic liquid phase behavior according to the classifications of Scott and van Konynenburg. Such an understanding can greatly help to predict what kinds of phase phenomena may be expected of such systems in regions outside those measured experimentally and can be a very valuable map when designing and optimizing processes involving gases and ionic liquids.",

     "abstract": "A family of modified van der Waals equations of state (vdW EOS) is extremely useful for many industrial applications. For example, the generic Redlich\u2013Kwong (RK) EOS or its modification by Soave (SRK EOS) and Peng\u2013Robinson (PR EOS) are still of popular use in industry to the present day. These two most popular (\u201ccubic\u201d) EOSs are based on modifications [1/(V2\u00a0+\u00a0bV), or 1/(V2\u00a0+\u00a02bV\u00a0\u2212\u00a0b2)] of the volume dependence on the attractive part of the original van der Waals EOS [1/V2] and also modifications of the temperature dependence of the attractive \u201ca(T)\u201d parameter of the original EOS (constant a). It is extremely rare in actual EOS applications to use the volume dependence of the original van der Waals EOS. In the present phase equilibrium calculations, we employ such a generic vdW EOS, P\u00a0=\u00a0RT/(V\u00a0\u2212\u00a0b)\u00a0\u2212\u00a0a(T)/V2, with our well-tested mixing rule for multi-component mixtures. Using the same form of the \u201ca(T)\u201d parameter and the mixing rule, it has been found that all generic RK, PR, and vdW EOSs can present the phase behaviors (temperature\u2013pressure\u2013composition diagrams) equally well. It is shown that experimental gas solubility data (CO2, CF3\u2013CFH2, SO2, and NH3) in room-temperature ionic liquids are well correlated with the present EOS model, and also that the phase behaviors such as LLE (liquid\u2013liquid separations) are satisfactorily predicted.",

     "abstract": "Absorption refrigerators are alternative systems to conventional compression cycles in which the energy necessary for the refrigeration is provided by heating instead of mechanical power. Commercial absorption refrigerators use two absorbent/refrigerant pairs: NH3\u2013H2O and H2O\u2013LiBr. These systems have some limitations due to the difficulty of separating absorbent and refrigerant, the narrow refrigeration temperature range, or the possibility of corrosion and salt deposition. The application of ionic liquids as absorbents with supercritical carbon dioxide as refrigerant can solve some of these problems because separation of ionic liquid from CO2 is easy due to the negligible vapor pressure of ionic liquids. In this work, suitable ionic liquids\u2013CO2 pairs have been selected considering their phase equilibrium properties, calculated with the Group-Contribution equation of state developed by Skjold-J\u00f8rgensen. The energetic efficiency of the process with ionic liquids has been estimated by calculation of the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the process. It has been found that the process with ionic liquids has a lower COP than conventional NH3\u2013H2O systems due to the necessity of operating with a higher solution flowrate. Nevertheless, near-optimum performance is obtained in a wide range of process conditions.",

     "abstract": "Biodiesel production from lipids (vegetable oils and animal fats) with non-catalytic supercritical methanol (SCM) has several advantages over that of homogeneous catalytic process, including a high production efficiency, environmentally friendliness and a wide range of possible feedstocks. This article reviews the effect of the operating parameters on the lipid conversion to biodiesel with SCM, such as the temperature, pressure, methanol to oil molar ratio, and reaction time, for both batch and continuous systems, including the effect of the mixing intensity and dispersion in tubular reactors. The operating temperature is the key parameter to control either extent of reaction or other parameters. Studies on evaluating the chemical kinetics, phase behavior, binary vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium (VLE) of lipid conversion in SCM are summarized. The pseudo-first order model is suitable to simplify the system at high methanol to oil molar ratios, but it is inadequate at a low methanol concentration which instead requires the second order model. Transition temperatures of reaction mixture depend on the critical point of reaction mixture which is assigned by methanol to oil molar ratio and amount of co-solvents in the system. For binary VLE studies, no single thermodynamic model for the overall process is available, probably because of the differences in the polarity between the initial and the final state of the reaction system. Since traditional operating parameters of the lipid conversion in SCM involve elevated temperatures and pressures, techniques for allowing milder operating conditions that employ the addition of co-solvents or catalysts are discussed. The ongoing and more extensive research on co-solvents, heterogeneous catalysts, phase behavior and multicomponent VLE of lipid conversion to biodiesel with SCM should provide a better understanding and achieve the goal of green biodiesel production technology in the near future.",

Methanol and ethanol were selected as modifiers. In the presence of ethanol, the solubility of budesonide in SBCW increased up to 10 times. In all reported cases, the solubility of budesonide was directly dependant on the dielectric constant of the solvent mixture. A correlation between the budesonide solubility data and the dielectric constant of SBCW was developed. The correlation parameters were altered to improve the accuracy of the outputs of the solubility model for 9-anthracenemethanol in SBCW. The model was able to predict budesonide solubility in SBCW and SBCW\u2013alcohol solutions with an average error of 3%. The model is applicable to all the budesonide\u2013SBCW\u2013alcohol systems investigated in this work and is valid for a broad range of SBCW ternary systems.The solubility of budesonide was also modelled using the Modified Universal Functional Activity Coefficient (M-UNIFAC) model. Corrections were made to the interaction parameters so that the M-UNIFAC model was able to reproduce the solubility of budesonide in SBCW within 5% of experimental values. In order to check the validity of the parameter correction, the solubility of 9-anthracenemethanol in SBCW was established and modelled.",

The pressure dependence of x C O 2 was almost the same for all measured acetates. The expansion coefficient and the partial molar volume estimated using the Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state was found to have regions: a nearly constant region and a rapidly changing region that seem to be caused by the interspaces. When the length of the alkyl chain increased, the interspaces became larger. CO2 molecules existed in the interspaces while the volume remains nearly constant in the lower x C O 2 region. However, there were no interspaces in the higher x C O 2 region where volume expanded rapidly and these trends were supported by the MD simulations. The fraction from the center of mass of CO2 to the carbonyl oxygen atom was highest in regions of lower x C O 2 , while the distance from the center of mass of CO2 to the carbonyl oxygen atom was shortest regardless of region or mixture.

     "abstract": "High-pressure carbon dioxide (HPCD) treatment is currently considered as an attractive non-thermal process for preserving food. Since the first level of interaction between HPCD and the bacterial cells is lowering of the pH, knowledge of the pH of a food product in contact with CO2 at high-pressure conditions is essential for a better understanding of the inactivation mechanism of HPCD. Therefore, a mathematical model was developed to predict the pH in complex aqueous food systems in contact with CO2 at high-pressure conditions as function of pressure, temperature and buffer capacity. In addition, a spectrofluorometric method using calcein as fluorescent pH indicator was designed for the in situ measurement of the pH of complex aqueous systems in contact with pressurized CO2 as function of pressure (10.5\u201318.0\u00a0MPa), temperature (25\u201335\u00a0\u00b0C), initial pH (4.0\u20138.0), working volume ratio (41.6\u201370.0%) and broth composition (0.1\u00a0M citrate buffer, 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer and 10% whey protein). To mimic a complex matrix, the bacterial Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth was used.In general, there was a good agreement between the measured and predicted pH values. Only for the lowest initial pH of the broth, a discrepancy between the measured and calculated pH values was noticed, implying that the proposed model needs some further refinement to properly take into account non-ideality of the liquid phase. Furthermore, the pH of the broth was significantly influenced by the initial pH of the solution but was not dependent on pressure, temperature and working volume ratio. The addition of complementary buffers to the broth also influenced the pH drop and this effect was dependent on the initial pH of the solution.",

The diffusion coefficients in modified SCCO2 decreased with increasing the ethanol mole fraction due to the chemical association between the two solutes and ethanol.

     "abstract": "This study presents the development of an improved technique for viscosity measurements under high pressure. The apparatus is based on the principle of the falling ball viscometer, implemented in a high-pressure autoclave fitted with visualisation windows. The originality here is that the balls fall through a tube open at both ends with a diameter slightly greater than that of the balls, allowing a simplified modelling and numerical simulation. A numerical approach has been used for viscosity determination. Calculations have been made with COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae with the laminar Navier\u2013Stokes model for Newtonian mixtures. It includes the specific hydrodynamic effects without the need for a calibration fluid. However, validation experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 298, 308 and 318\u00a0K and with cocoa butter at 313 and 353\u00a0K, with values of viscosity in the range from 1.4 to 45.4\u00a0mPa\u00a0s. Comparative measurements with literature data have been conducted with cocoa butter saturated with carbon dioxide at 313 and 353\u00a0K and for pressures ranging from 0.1 to 25\u00a0MPa. At 313\u00a0K, viscosity varies from 45.4\u00a0mPa\u00a0s to 3.1\u00a0mPa\u00a0s while at 353\u00a0K it varies from 12.4 to 1.9\u00a0mPa\u00a0s. For both isotherms tested, within the range 0\u201315\u00a0MPa, the higher the CO2 dissolution in the cocoa butter, the lower the viscosity. However, this decrease in viscosity is more pronounced at the lowest temperature. Above 15\u00a0MPa the CO2 dissolution effect on viscosity becomes insignificant, i.e. within the experimental error, due to a counter effect linked with the high hydrostatic pressure.

The purpose is to provide detailed information on heat transfer behavior which is hard to be observed in experimental studies and to help to better understand the heat transfer mechanism. Simulation starts with five key issues, including physical model, mathematical models, mesh independency, boundary conditions and solution methods. The results demonstrate that almost all models are able to reproduce the trend of heat transfer characteristics qualitatively, and LB low Re turbulence model shows the best agreement with the experimental data, followed by standard k\u2013\u025b model with enhanced wall treatment. After the validation, further studies are discussed on velocity and turbulence fields, buoyancy effect, and heat transfer mechanism. It concludes that buoyancy significantly affects the turbulent flow, and evidently enhances the cooling heat transfer of supercritical CO2, especially in the vicinity of pseudo-critical point. The mixed convection is the main heat transfer mechanism during supercritical CO2 cooling process.",

The major compound contributing to the characteristic flavor of Pandan is 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP). This highly volatile compound also contributes significantly to the flavor of aromatic rice such as basmati and jasmine rice. As the consumer requirement for use of natural flavors, extraction of components from natural sources has been sought. In this study, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and solvent extraction of components from Pandan leaves were performed. Experimental parameters included particle size and drying method (oven and freeze drying). Results indicated that the initial value of moisture content and particle size of Pandan leaves had the greatest effect on the total yield and 2AP concentration of the extracts. Almost 80% of water in Pandan leaves can be removed by drying. Yields of supercritical extracts were 10 times lower when compared to the hexane extracts. The total yield of extracts was increased up to 50% with decreasing particle size of Pandan leaves.

Canadian oil sand bitumen mined by the steam assisted gravity drainage method was treated in an autoclave at 420\u2013450\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u201330\u00a0MPa for up to 120\u00a0min with three kinds of reaction media: SCW, high-pressure nitrogen, and supercritical toluene. The yields of gaseous products indicated that a very small amount of water was involved in the upgrading reaction. The analytical results of the middle distillate fractions were almost the same using water and nitrogen at 450\u00a0\u00b0C. The distillation residues produced in SCW had lower molecular weight distributions, lower H/C atomic ratios, higher aromaticities, and consequently more condensed structures compared to those produced in nitrogen. The coke produced using SCW also had lower H/C values and higher aromaticities. Judging from all the analytical results, the upgrading of bitumen by SCW reaction was primarily considered to be physical in nature. As a result, it is possible to highly disperse the heavy fractions by SCW. This dispersion effect of SCW led to intramolecular dehydrogenation of the heavier component and prevention of recombination reactions, and consequently gave the highest conversion.",

Decomposition of bitumen in SCW\u00a0+\u00a0HCOOH gave higher conversions of asphaltene and lower coke yields than those of pyrolysis or with only SCW. Decomposition of bitumen was also conducted in SCW\u00a0+\u00a0H2, SCW\u00a0+\u00a0CO, toluene and tetralin, which revealed that decomposition of asphaltene was promoted and coke formation was suppressed when using SCW\u00a0+\u00a0HCOOH. In SCW\u00a0+\u00a0HCOOH, an increase in the water/oil ratio promoted both decomposition of asphaltene and suppression of coke formation. Formic acid in SCW seemed to enhance the conversion of bitumen to lower molecular weight compounds because formic acid seems to produce active species in SCW. The low temperature region (ca. 723\u00a0K) was suitable for upgrading bitumen with formic acid in SCW since coke formation was strongly promoted at high temperature (>753\u00a0K). A reaction model was proposed and the model predicted that hydrogenation of the asphaltene core was important for the suppression of coke formation.",

The results of hydrothermal and oxidative experiments carried out in a continuous high-pressure plant with a feed solution of 0.2\u20131.2% (g\u00a0g\u22121) glucose at 24\u201334\u00a0MPa, 250\u2013480\u00a0\u00b0C and residence times of 2\u201335\u00a0s are presented. In the presence of a stoichiometric oxygen concentration (for total oxidation to carbon dioxide and water) glucose decomposes already at subcritical temperatures readily to carbon monoxide and low molecular liquid substances, chiefly organic acids like e.g. acetic acid and glycolic acid. In turn these are in general more stable and react only slowly with oxygen. The effect of temperature, residence time, pressure, reactant concentration and addition of zinc sulfate on the conversion and the yields of reaction products was demonstrated. Already at 350\u00a0\u00b0C (24\u00a0MPa and 30\u00a0s) 99% of the glucose are converted. With increasing temperature the production of CO2 increases. However, even at 480\u00a0\u00b0C (34\u00a0MPa and 4\u00a0s) significant amounts of CO are formed and the reaction of glucose to CO2 and H2O is not complete.

The static mixer used to saturate the solution with CO2 has been analyzed with phase equilibrium and mass transfer calculations, concluding that a significant fraction of water is extracted to the gas phase already in the static mixer, and high CO2 concentrations are achieved in the liquid due to the high solubility of CO2 in PEG. All experimental trends of variation of particle size with process parameters can be explained considering a flash-boiling atomization mechanism dependant on the concentration of CO2 in the solution after the static mixer.",

Erlotinib HCl was recrystallized from its mean particle size of 20\u00a0\u03bcm to 2\u00a0\u03bcm with different crystal habits. Different polymorphs of erlotinib HCl were obtained and confirmed from the XRD and DSC results. The prior art polymorph form A of erlotinib HCl showed enhanced dissolution rate by 3.6 times to its original polymorph form B. Significant particle size reduction was also obtained for fulvestrant. The mean particle size was reduced from its original value of 22\u00a0\u03bcm to 2\u00a0\u03bcm with much narrower particle size distribution. The cross-interaction effect between the operating temperature and pressure observed in the SAS treatment of fulvestrant was verified by the method of calculated mixture critical point (MCP). The micronized fulvestrant particles showed consistent polymorph as the original API, but with different crystal habits. It is confirmed that the SAS method is applicable for controlling the crystal properties of two APIs, erlotinib HCl and fulvestrant, which require rigorous control of physical characteristics.",

Aluminum samples oxidized by H2O and H2O/CO2 fluids at the injection mostly consist of large particles (300\u2013500\u00a0nm) of \u03b1-Al2O3. Those oxidized for uniform temperature increase contain smaller particles (20\u201370\u00a0nm) of \u03b3-Al2O3 as well. Mechanism of this phenomenon is explained by orientation of oxygen in H2O polar molecules to the metal in the electric field of contact voltage at Al/AlOOH and Al/Al2O3 boundary.

DSC measurements found a low glass transition temperature (TgL) at near 50\u00a0\u00b0C in the wholly amorphous PET and a high glass transition temperature (TgH) at near 70\u00a0\u00b0C in the PET sample with a fairly high crystallinity (Xc 50%). Both TgL and TgH decreased with increasing time in CO2, attributed to plasticization by CO2. PET sample with a moderate crystallinity (Xc 42%), however, exhibited both TgL and TgH corresponding to the relaxations of the dual amorphous phases as confirmed by dynamic mechanical analysis, with the TgL assigned to the free amorphous phase and the TgH to the constrained amorphous phase. The TgL is much farther apart from TgH than those obtained in N2. The TgL and TgH in PET with a moderate crystallinity unexpectedly appeared to be insignificantly varied with time in CO2; however, the magnitude of the TgL signal increased but the TgH signal decreased with increasing time in CO2, attributed to disentanglement of polymer chains by CO2. Dual melting peaks in PET were found after nonisothermal crystallization from the melt in CO2.

     "abstract": "In this study, sessile drops are imaged in a high-pressure and high-temperature view chamber to determine the density and interfacial tension of linear polypropylene (LPP) and branched polypropylene (BPP) melts in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2). The pressure\u2013volume\u2013temperature (PVT) data of polyprophylene (PP)\u2013CO2 is investigated by monitoring the swelling changes of the polymer melt in supercritical CO2. The density difference between the polymer/CO2 mixture and the CO2 is determined by combining the swelling results with the CO2 solubility information in the polymer melt. Both the Sanchez\u2013Lacombe (SL) and the Simha\u2013Somcynsky (SS) equations-of-state (EOS) are applied to predict the density of the PP\u2013CO2 mixture, which is then compared to the density data obtained experimentally. The dependence of interfacial tension on the temperature and pressure of PP in supercritical CO2 is investigated at temperatures from 180\u00a0\u00b0C to 220\u00a0\u00b0C and pressures up to 31\u00a0MPa. Effects of long-chain branching on the density and interfacial tension of PP\u2013CO2 mixtures are discussed.",

Foaming experiments were also carried out within the confinement of specially designed molds with porous metal surfaces as boundaries to direct the fluid escape path and to generate foams with controlled overall shape and dimensions. These experiments were conducted in pure carbon dioxide and also in carbon dioxide\u00a0+\u00a0acetone fluid mixtures over a wide range of temperatures and pressures.

Adding acetone to carbon dioxide improved the uniformity of the pores compared to foams formed by carbon dioxide alone. In addition, a unique high-pressure solution extrusion system was designed and used to form porous tubular constructs by piston-extrusion of a solution from a high-pressure dissolution chamber through an annular die into a second chamber maintained at controlled pressure/temperature and fluid conditions. Long uniform porous tubular constructs with 6\u00a0mm ID and 1\u00a0mm wall thickness were generated with glassy polymers like poly(methyl methacrylate) by extruding solutions composed of 50\u00a0wt% polymer\u00a0+\u00a050\u00a0wt% acetone, or 25\u00a0wt% polymer\u00a0+\u00a010% acetone\u00a0+\u00a065% carbon dioxide at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 28\u00a0MPa.

In this work, a complex hybrid release system consisting in a three-dimensional (3D) structure based on poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PDLLA) impregnated with chitosan/chondroitin sulfate nanoparticles (NPs) was developed. The scaffolds were prepared by supercritical fluid foaming at 200\u00a0bar and 35\u00a0\u00b0C, and were then characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-CT. SEM also allowed to assess the distribution of the NPs within the structure, showing that the particles could be found in different areas of the scaffold, indicating a homogeneous distribution within the 3D structure. Water uptake and weight loss measurements were also carried out and the results obtained demonstrated that weight loss was not significantly enhanced although the entrapment of the NPs in the 3D structure clearly enhances the swelling of the structure. Moreover, the hybrid porous biomaterial displayed adequate mechanical properties for cell adhesion and support. The possibility of using this scaffold as a multifunctional material was further evaluated by the incorporation of a model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), either directly into the PDLLA foam or in the NPs that were eventually included in the scaffold. The obtained results show that it is possible to achieve different release kinetics, suggesting that this system is a promising candidate for dual protein delivery system for TE applications.",

The influence of those parameters affecting the final particle size distribution and morphology, primarily emulsifier amount and magnetite content, has been investigated, so as to optimize the process. Analysis of the products, performed through light scattering and electron microscopy, indicates that narrower size distributions are obtained with larger amounts of emulsifier and lower amounts of magnetite. The morphology of the particles tends to be of Janus type, with the magnetite accumulated on one hemisphere of the particle. The proposed approach is suitable for the preparation of large quantities of high-quality magnetite\u2013PLGA composite nanoparticles for biomedical applications.",

In the antisolvent technique, solid particles were dispersed in a solution containing the polymer and mixed with scCO2; polymer precipitation, induced by the presence of CO2, occurred preferentially onto the available surface offered by the oxide particles. For CO2-soluble modifiers, the molecules were transferred from the compressed phase to the surface of the solid particles by diffusion; reactivity between adequate moieties permitted to form covalently grafted films.

For this purpose, agrochemical formulations of the essential oils should be physically stable in the long term and should enhance the biological performance of the agrochemical. In this work, such a formulation of lavandin essential oil obtained by encapsulation of the oil in a biodegradable polymer has been studied. Two high-pressure precipitation techniques, particles from gas saturated solutions (PGSS) and PGSS-drying, have been applied to perform the encapsulation. The PGSS process has been used to encapsulate the oil in polyethylene glycol (PEG). With PGSS-drying the oil has been encapsulated in n-octenyl succinic (OSA)-modified starches, by removing the water form an oil-in-water emulsion stabilized using the OSA-starches as surfactants. Operating conditions were selected in order to reduce oil losses due to its dissolution in supercritical CO2 or due to emulsion destabilization. A comparison between the characteristics of the particles obtained by encapsulation in PEG with PGSS and by encapsulation in OSA-starches with PGSS-drying was done. Results revealed that encapsulation efficiencies of lavandin oil were higher in PEG microcapsules obtained by PGSS (14\u201366% of initial oil encapsulated). Particles show a spherical morphology and a narrow particle size distribution, which is favourable for a controlled release of lavandin essential oil.",

In addition, the evaluation of temperature (30\u201350\u00a0\u00b0C) and pressure (50\u2013200\u00a0bar) effect on peroxidase activity and stability in dense propane medium is also shown. In each experimental condition, enzyme extract samples were analyzed after 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120\u00a0min of high pressure treatment. Peroxidase remained active (U/mL) after 120\u00a0min incubation at 30 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, while at 50\u00a0\u00b0C, the enzyme activity (U/mL) was lower at 200\u00a0bar (residual activity of 50%) than at 50\u00a0bar (67% residual activity). Lyophilized sample treatment led to an increase in RP activity (115% residual activity). This result indicates that the treatment with compressed propane is a viable technique for extract purification as well as specific activity increase of peroxidases.",

The influence of the temperature and pressure on the extraction efficiency and on the extract antioxidant activity was studied using a factorial experimental design. The extraction efficiency varied from 7.7% to 76.7% and only extraction temperature had a statically significant effect on the process. The reversed phase HPLC analysis showed that lycopene is the major compound of the extract.

The compounds of interest are first extracted from the vegetable matter, using a tartaric buffer to avoid extract degradation due to polyphenol oxidase, hydrolysis or esterification and to eliminate part of the interfering compounds (mainly sugars). Then, they are selectively adsorbed on a C18 column and desorbed using methanol. The methanolic solution is processed by supercritical antisolvent extraction (SAE) at various process conditions. The optimized result is a powderous, solventless precipitate that, in the case of Cannonau cultivar, contains 33 polyphenols and 7 anthocyanins. The overall content of polyphenols recovered is of 521\u00a0mg/kg and the total content of anthocyanins is of 15542\u00a0mg/kg of treated material.

In order to identify the flavoring and hypoglycemic substances present in this plant, this work has an objective for the extraction of the essential oil presented in the leaves of abajeru using the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). The supercritical solvent used is CO2, because of its moderate critical temperature and pressure, atoxicity, low cost and volatility. The experiments were conducted using dried leaves in an apparatus containing a high-pressure pump, a stainless steel extractor of 42\u00a0mL of volume and a micrometric valve for sampling. Different operational conditions were tested, varying mainly the temperature (313.15\u2013353.15\u00a0K) and the pressure (10.5\u201320\u00a0kPa) in order to investigate the efficiency of the process. The results showed that the best operational condition was at 20\u00a0kPa and 353.15\u00a0K. To compare the supercritical carbon dioxide results, the essential oil was also extracted by hydrodistillation and soxhlet, using ethanol as solvent. The chromatographic analysis showed that the different technologies studied extracted the same classes of compounds but the SFE obtained the extract with potential hypoglycemic activity with the presence of lupenol.",

On the other hand, the activity of Rh/Al2O3 was completely lost in an early stage of reaction. The features of these multiphase catalytic hydrogenation reactions using compressed CO2 were studied in detail by phase behavior and solubility measurements, in situ high-pressure FTIR for molecular interactions of CO2 with reacting species and formation/adsorption of CO on the catalysts, and simulation of reaction kinetics using a simple model. The CO2 pressurization was shown to suppress the hydrogenation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol, improving the selectivity to cyclohexanone. The formation and adsorption of CO were observed for the two catalysts at high CO2 pressures in the presence of H2, which was one of important factors retarding the rate of hydrogenation in the presence of CO2. It was further indicated that the adsorption of CO on Rh/Al2O3 was strong and caused the complete loss of its activity.",

Among eight screened imidazolium ILs, [C10mim]NTf2 was employed as additive, or as the coating agent of ruthenium catalyst in the reaction under supercritical conditions.The coating of the heterogeneous catalyst allows the selective production of p-menthene and increases the conversion level of limonene (>99%) compared to the conversion of limonene in the reaction carried out in the presence of an ionic liquid as an additive. Results of the catalyst recycling indicate that there is no depletion of catalyst reactivity even after four successive cycles of operation under the studied reaction conditions. Further hydrogenation of p-menthene is strongly inhibited by employing an ionic liquid. The solubility of limonene or p-menthene in an ionic liquid governs the selective hydrogenation of limonene towards p-menthene.",

The data set consisting of 42 esterification reactions of different acids and alcohols in scCO2 using different temperatures and pressures. The percent conversion was related to the most feasible descriptors such as temperature, pressure, dipole moment and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the alcohols, dipole moment, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and heat of formation of the acids. These descriptors were related to the percent conversion of the esterification reactions using least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) approach. The parameters of the LS-SVR consisting of the regularization and the kernel, were optimized by constructing models with all the possible combinations of these two parameters. The model with the minimum root mean squared error of cross-validation (RMSECV) for the calibration set was selected as the best model and the parameters of this model were selected as the optimized values. Both internal and external validations were performed to validate the performance of the model. The results revealed that the calculated conversion values are in good agreement with the experimental ones, and the performance of the LS-SVR model was superior to the multiple linear regression (MLR) ones.",

The transesterification by a primary alcohol apparently obeyed zero-order kinetics with respect to ethyl acetate and the primary alcohol during most of the reaction. The transesterification was assumed to be a two-step reaction. The initial step is the hydrolysis of the supercritical ethyl acetate to acetic acid by the small amount of water in the reaction system. The later step is the esterification of the generated acetic acid with the higher alcohol. When a primary alcohol was used as the reaction partner for the supercritical ethyl acetate, a high yield of the transesterified product was obtained. On the other hand, when a secondary alcohol was used, a moderate yield was obtained. The moderate yield with a secondary alcohol would be due to the transformation of the transesterified product into unknown products.",

Experimental data were best described by the cubic Hill isotherm model, which accounted for the change of curvature of the elution profiles observed as concentrations in the mobile phase increased.

With this method, we have discovered that flow patterns within the vessel are quite disperse and are strongly accelerated by buoyant forces. This method has the beneficial feature that measurements can be taken that are completely non-invasive (for suitable vessel materials, such as zirconium alloys) and do not require the presence of windows or thermowells.

     "abstract": "Inorganic compounds are regularly present in aqueous streams. To understand their influence and behavior on these streams at supercritical conditions, little to no property data is available, which can be used as starting point for further research or application design. Since inorganic compounds tend to precipitate at these conditions, scaling, blocking and erosion can occur as a consequence. Furthermore, a separation of (precious) compounds from the bulk stream due to the precipitation is possible. Here, phosphate compounds are regarded as interesting for further investigation since resources are assumed to be depleted in future. As phosphate is present in many waste streams, these could be used as sources for recoverable phosphate. Resulting from these facts and options, a proper understanding and knowledge of these systems is important for later industrial applications. Therefore, the authors have investigated the behavior of salts (e.g. NaCl, NaNO 3 and MgCl 2 ) in supercritical water in previous works.To extend this knowledge, the solubilities of the sulfate salts MgSO 4 and CaSO 4 in a range of 18.8\u201323.2\u00a0MPa and 655\u2013675\u00a0K as well as of the phosphate salts Na 2 HPO 4 , NaH 2 PO 4 and CaHPO 4 in a range of 20.5\u201324.2\u00a0MPa and 665\u2013690\u00a0K were investigated in this work with a continuous flow method in continuation of former work of the authors. The solubilities were compared with existing data available from open literature. A quantitative correlation on base of a phase equilibrium between the present phases was used to describe the behavior and to compare it with previous results. For the investigated calcium salts, CaSO 4 and CaHPO 4 , it was found that a significant solubility decrease already happens at subcritical conditions resulting in precipitation in unwanted locations. For the remaining compounds, a parallel hydrolysis reaction was found as could be seen from a change in pH in the effluent stream.",

     "abstract": "Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of liquid oleoresins (Capsicum annuum L. and Capsicum frutescens L.) was carried out in order to improve properties of oleoresins obtained by traditional processes using organic solvents. SFE allowed us to fractionate the different compounds present in oleoresins recovering both, an extract and a raffinate which can fulfill trader's needs. The aim of this work was to study the effect of pressure (140\u2013300\u00a0bar) and temperature (313\u2013333\u00a0K) affecting the yield and the commercial value of oleoresins extracts and raffinates, expressed in terms of parameters such as colour (SCU), pungency (SHU) and carotenoids and capsaicinoids concentration. A set of previous experiments was carried out to select the most suitable type of oleoresin and the initial ratio CO2/oleoresin which assures initial conditions in the biphasic area of CO2/oleoresin diagram to produce fractionation. A response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the effect of the factors over the variables and different linear correlations were proposed and validated to describe the responses studied. 300\u00a0bar and 333\u00a0K were selected as the best operational conditions to obtain fractionation. Finally, solubility parameters were obtained and correlated with semi-empirical models in order to obtain correlations which will be useful in subsequent stages of scaling-up.",

     "abstract": "Supercritical fluid extraction from dried banana peel (Musa spp., subgroup Prata, genomic group AAB, popularly known in Brazil as Enxerto) was studied. The aspects investigated were: overall extraction curve (OEC), mass transfer modeling of the yield curves, economical analysis of the process and phase equilibrium data for the pseudo-ternary system of banana peel extract, carbon dioxide and ethanol. The extraction operating conditions evaluated were: pressure ranging from 100\u00a0bar to 300\u00a0bar, temperature from 40 to 50\u00a0\u00b0C and constant solvent flow rate of 5.0\u00a0gCO2/min. Experimental extraction data were correlated using three kinetic models based on mass transfer equations (logistic, diffusion and Esqu\u00edvel models). Phase equilibrium measurements were performed using pressure from 64.9\u00a0bar to 239.9\u00a0bar and mass fraction of supercritical extract from 0.52 to 3.55\u00a0wt%. Yield results ranged from 0.6 to 6.9% d.b. (dry basis). The lowest deviation between experimental and correlated data was obtained by the Logistic model, except for the curve at 300\u00a0bar and 40\u00a0\u00b0C which was best represented by the Esqu\u00edvel model. The economical analysis identified the possibility to apply the supercritical fluids to obtain extracts from banana peel in an industrial scale. Phase equilibrium for the supercritical extract from banana peel with carbon dioxide modified by ethanol exhibited liquid\u2013liquid, vapor\u2013liquid (bubble point) and vapor\u2013liquid\u2013liquid phase transitions. A crossover phenomenon for the systems evaluated was observed for pressures between 200\u00a0bar and 240\u00a0bar, for both groups of assays, i.e., supercritical extraction and phase equilibrium.",

     "abstract": "Brazilian Ginseng extracts of two species, Pfaffia paniculata and Pfaffia glomerata, were obtained by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with CO2 and by low-pressure solvent extraction (LPSE) with methanol, hexane and ethanol. The SFE assays were conducted at pressures of 100, 200 and 300\u00a0bar, and temperatures of 30 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. The qualitative chemical compositions of the extracts were determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC). One of the active principles of interest from P. glomerata extract, \u03b2-ecdysone, was identified and quantified by HPLC. The antioxidant activities of Brazilian Ginseng extracts were determined by the coupled reaction of linolenic acid and \u03b2-carotene. For P. paniculata, the highest SFE yield was obtained at 200\u00a0bar/50\u00a0\u00b0C (0.22%, dry basis\u2014d.b.), while the best extraction condition for P. glomerata was obtained at 200\u00a0bar/30\u00a0\u00b0C (0.18%, d.b.). The higher extract yields obtained by LPSE were 2.0% and 5.8% (w/w, d.b.) for P. paniculata and P. glomerata, respectively, both obtained with methanol as extraction solvent. From the overall extraction curve of P. glomerata, it was possible to obtain the kinetic parameters of extraction; the duration of the CER (constant extraction rate) period was determined as 134\u00a0min. The TLC plates showed the possible presence of flavonoids in the ethanolic extract for both Pfaffia species. The antioxidant activity analysis detected that LPSE extracts had higher activity than SFE extracts.",

The effect of hydrogen partial pressure on the hydrogenation of \u03b2-myrcene possessing three CC bonds catalysed by alumina-supported ruthenium and rhodium was studied. Experiments were performed at various hydrogen pressures in the range from 2.0 up to 4.5\u00a0MPa at a fixed total pressure of 12.5\u00a0MPa. In all the conditions the reaction proceeded in two phases (liquid\u00a0+\u00a0gas), that is, the total pressure was below the critical pressure of the CO2\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b2-myrcene\u00a0+\u00a0H2 system. The liquid phase volume is expanded in relation to the initial volume of \u03b2-myrcene in a fashion that is strongly dependent on the hydrogen and carbon dioxide pressures. An increase of H2 pressure concomitantly diminishes carbon dioxide pressure, which leads to the enhancement of the liquid phase in hydrogen and a terpene. It does not direct to straightforward higher reaction rate, but surprisingly the effect of higher concentrations either hydrogen or \u03b2-myrcene is opposite. It is attributed to the fact that the hydrogenation of \u03b2-myrcene rate-controlling factor turns out to be the hydrogen to \u03b2-myrcene ratio which decreases as the hydrogen pressure increases. These unexpected appealing results present that lower pressures of hydrogen guide to higher hydrogen/\u03b2-myrcene ratios in the liquid phase, but on the other hand they also amplify the initial reaction rate constant. The obtained results are opposite to the results achieved for effect of hydrogen pressure on the Pd-catalysed hydrogenation of limonene consisting of two CC double bonds.",

     "abstract": "Batch experiments on chicken fat reactions with methanol were performed at supercritical conditions to answer basic questions regarding the transesterification characteristics such as reactant ratios, lipid and reaction product thermal stability, reaction reversibility, nature of the intermediates, and glycerol consumption. The experiments were conducted at temperatures of 300\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C, pressures up to 41.1\u00a0MPa, methanol to triglyceride molar ratios of 3:1 and 6:1, and reaction times from 2 to 6\u00a0min. The results show that the transesterification process to produce biodiesel from low-cost lipid feedstocks with low excess of methanol and without glycerol generation is technically feasible. Since thermal decomposition of chicken fat at these temperatures is an important issue to be considered, batch experiments with emphasis on this aspect were also carried out. It was found that the thermal decomposition of chicken fat was not significant if heated up to 350\u00a0\u00b0C which will permit preheating the feedstock up to this temperature in a more practical flow process. Additional experiments showed that the overall transesterification at these conditions is not reversible and that the byproduct glycerol thermally decomposed and reacted with methanol to form ethers and other fuel components. The use of low-cost lipid feedstocks and moderate excess of methanol, associated with glycerol in situ consumption, has the potential to increase biodiesel profitability for continuous flow processes that are coupled with power generation.",

It was studied at pressure between 1.1 and 28.0\u00a0MPa and temperature from 150 to 270\u00a0\u00b0C. The transition of phases and composition of identified phases was calculated using RK-Aspen EOS and obtained values were also compared to experimentally determined data at subcritical condition (1.1\u20134.5\u00a0MPa and 150\u2013210\u00a0\u00b0C).Results of experimental investigation, as well as performed simulation of some specified composition of reaction mixture, showed that system of triglycerides and methanol, at the beginning of reaction (at all analysed conditions except for supercritical state of mixture) is in equilibrium between two liquid phases. During the methanolysis of triglycerides, the phase's distribution was changed accordingly and it highly depends on actual composition of reaction mixture, temperature and pressure. Calculated and measured values indicated that distribution of methanol between the oil phase, the methyl esters, and the glycerol rich phase exists and depends of working condition. As a consequence of fact, that the methanolysis of triglycerides (oil) is mainly realized in the oil-rich phase, at the end of reaction, after all triglycerides are converted into FAME and glycerol, the oil phase disappears. Furthermore, according to the results of phase composition calculation, it was shown that from the beginning to the end of reaction one phase only exists, for methanolysis performed at 270\u00a0\u00b0C and 20.0\u00a0MPa.",

X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-ray micro-CT) was used to determine the voidage (% open pore space) of the dried structures, which can be used to indicate the extent of drying-induced structural collapse (in general, the lower the voidage, the greater the collapse). For formulations containing sucrose, which displayed the best structural retention, voidage was found to increase in the order: air drying (4% voidage)\u00a0<\u00a0supercritical drying with pure CO2 (48%)\u00a0<\u00a0supercritical drying with ethanol-modified CO2 (68%)\u00a0<\u00a0freeze drying (76%). The relatively high voidage of samples dried in the presence of ethanol, was due in part to foaming of the gels, hypothesised to result from an interaction between the agar and ethanol, rather than an effect of the supercritical fluid. CO2 flow rate (1 vs. 3\u00a0l/min) during supercritical drying and depressurisation rate (0.4 vs. 1.6\u00a0MPa/min) had no effect on the dried microstructure.",

Experiments were carried out testing the effects of different electric field strengths (6, 9 and 12\u00a0kV/cm) and energy inputs (10, 20 and 40\u00a0J/ml) on the microbial inactivation during the PEF pretreatment. Pressures of 8.0, 11.0 and 14.0\u00a0MPa and treatment times ranging from 3 to 30\u00a0min were applied during the HPCD treatment following the PEF pretreatment stage, with the aim of investigating the synergistic effect of the combined treatment. For comparison, inactivation curves of the microorganism during the single PEF and HPCD treatments were determined.Results showed that treating the cell suspensions only with PEF, the maximum inactivation level that could be achieved was 0.35\u00a0log-cycles after a treatment at 12\u00a0kV/cm and 20\u00a0J/ml. On the other hand, when yeast cells were treated only with HPCD, the maximum inactivation level detected was 1.79\u00a0log-cycles treating the sample at a pressure of 8.0\u00a0MPa for 3\u00a0min. With increasing the pressure up to 14.0\u00a0MPa and the treatment time up to 30\u00a0min no further increase of cells inactivation was detected.A completely different behavior was observed utilizing the combination of PEF and HPCD treatments. In this case, with increasing the field strength and the electrical energy input in the selected range, a remarkable increase of the inactivation after the combined treatment was detected. At a certain intensity of the PEF pretreatment, the use of more severe CO2 pressures and HPCD processing time did not determine any further reduction of the microbial population.

     "abstract": "The extraction of lipids from both wet and dry biomass produced by fermentation has been carried out using near-critical dimethylether (DME) as the extraction solvent. Fermentations were carried out from a shake flask up to a 300\u00a0L scale using the microorganism Mortierella alpina, and up to a 20\u00a0L scale for Phaffia rhodozyma and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The lipids extracted at a laboratory and pilot scale from the biomasses were enriched in arachidonic acid, astaxanthin, and co-enzyme Q10 respectively. Extractions were also performed on marine microalgae, produced by a proprietary fermentation process, to obtain lipids rich in EPA. Lipids were extracted from wet biomass using DME, which removes the need to dry the biomass. Water is also co-extracted, which has to be separated from the lipid. The biomass shrunk considerably during packed bed extraction of wet biomass, leading to channelling. Repacking and re-extraction of the packed bed enabled full lipid yields to be obtained. The extraction of lipids from biomass suspended in fermentation broth showed considerable promise, and lipid yields were improved due to the recovery of lipids that had been exuded into the broth from the microorganism. In contrast, the extraction of lipids from freeze-dried biomass using DME was routine, yields were substantially higher than using CO2 or CO2\u00a0+\u00a0ethanol, but were lower than from wet biomass. DME also extracted polar lipids from both wet and dry biomass, leading to the higher total lipid yields compared to CO2. Separate extraction of non-polar and polar lipids was possible by sequential extraction of dry biomass using initially CO2 followed optionally with ethanol co-solvent; and then DME.",

     "abstract": "Biomass is the ideal alternative renewable energy that might help decrease CO2 emissions. Super Critical Water Gasification (SCWG) is a recent treatment method which is still being developed as regards wet biomass. Above its critical point, water has specific properties and is able to convert wet biomass into gas, and especially into hydrogen. In order to propose a general reaction scheme of the SCWG as regards the lignocellulosic biomass conversion, the interactions between lignin and cellulose must be highlighted. Lignocellulosic biomass could be modelled with phenol (substitute for lignin) and glucose (substitute for cellulose).In a continuous flow tubular reactor, the gasification of solutions containing phenol and glucose or either of the two pure compounds is more efficiently performed when in presence of an alkaline catalyst. The comparison of global parameters, such as the Total Organic Carbon content (TOC), the composition of the liquid product phase (glucose, phenol, etc.), the volume and composition of the gas phase (H2, CO2, CH4, etc.), showed that a small quantity of phenol in a glucose solution dramatically decreased the efficiency of the solution's conversion.",

Yields of asphaltene, maltene, and coke were evaluated. With increasing water density, the rate of coke formation was promoted. To get some hints of coke formation mechanism, the formed coke was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The most part of the coke formed st neat pyrolysis (pyrolysis in the absence of high density water) was coalescent structure of some small coke particles, while that at pyrolysis in the presence of water (200\u00a0kg/m3 of water density) was porous structure that indicated occurrence of phase inversion of coke precursors. Based on the results, the reaction mechanism of the heavy oil upgrading was considered: lighter oil was extracted in high density water and the concentration of light hydrocarbon decreased in a heavier oil phase, while the concentration of heavier oil in the oil phase increased. Thus, the lighter oil decomposed further in high density water phase and the heavier oil in the oil phase combined together to form coke due to its higher concentration.",

Its conversion into biofuel for further application via combustion increases its economic interest despite the initial low calorific value. In the present study, the conversion process is carried out in supercritical water (SCW), thus improving significantly the energy balance by eliminating the need for drying the biomass. The SCW dissolution, hydrolysis and oxidation of pure substances in a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC) have been studied previously and unique results concerning the homogeneous dissolution of naphthalene, cellulose and glucose were acquired. The current investigation was performed for samples representing real biomass (winery residues) rather than pure substances. Visualizations of the SCW biomass gasification process were obtained and the products of the decomposition were also analyzed.

     "abstract": "The aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) co-precipitation process to influence the crystallinity or amorphous character of a crystalline non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indomethacin (IDMC) for solubility enhancement. Co-precipitations of IDMC and the water-soluble polymer excipient poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) have been prepared by SAS. The SAS co-precipitates with drug to polymer ratios of 85:15, 50:50 and 20:80 were generated using supercritical carbon dioxide as anti-solvent. The untreated and SAS powders (before and after storage) were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, morphology), powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD, crystallinity), USP dissolution tester and thermogravimetric analysis. In addition, stability stress tests on SAS co-precipitates on open pans were carried out at 75% RH and room temperature or 40\u00a0\u00b0C in order to evaluate their physical stability. SAS co-precipitates with PVP contents more than 50\u00a0wt.% were X-ray amorphous and remained stable after 7 months storage at 75% RH and room temperature or 40\u00a0\u00b0C. It was demonstrated that the drug to polymer ratio influenced amorphous content of the SAS co-precipitates. By using different polymer ratios, the morphologies of a drug\u2013polymer composite can be varied. TGA analyses revealed that the composition of SAS co-precipitates were consistent with the experimentally designed composition. Amorphous form of IDMC produced by SAS has improved dissolution properties as compared to the crystalline form. This form is also stable under stress test conditions compared as with spray-dried amorphous indomethacin. It is suggested that PVP excipient could be a suitable \u201camorphous inducing and stabilizing\u201d agent for SAS process.",

     "abstract": "In this work, adsorption and crystallization of benzoic acid in different porous carriers (silica aerogel, MCM41, Trisopor glass, zeolite) from supercritical CO2 solutions is studied. The main purpose is to reveal the influence of the adsorptive properties of the carrier on the crystallization behavior of the solute. Therefore, both adsorption and crystallization processes are studied as a function of carrier's surface properties. Adsorption of the solute and CO2 is measured in situ using a magnetic suspension balance, whereas crystallization is realized in a high pressure view cell. The carriers could be loaded with up to \u223c35\u00a0wt.% of benzoic acid, depending on the nature and the amount of the functional groups of the carrier. The size of the benzoic acid particles obtained inside the aerogel matrix depends on the crystallization conditions and is in the range of \u223c20\u00a0nm\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm. The crystallinity of the particles was studied and it is shown that the physical state of the loaded benzoic acid inside the pores of aerogels is influenced by benzoic acid\u2013aerogel surface interactions: strong interactions favor the amorphous form, weak interactions favor crystalline particles. The amorphous form of benzoic acid is shown to be stable over a long time period. Thus, silica aerogels can be used for stabilizing amorphous forms of organic compounds, which can be used for instance in pharmaceutical applications for the improvement of drug bioavailability.",

This work studies the solubility of CO2 in phosphonium-based ionic liquids that, unlike imidazolium-based ILs, have received little attention in spite of their interesting characteristics. This work addresses the study of the gas\u2013liquid equilibrium of two ionic liquids, trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride, in a wide range of temperatures, pressures, showing that phosphonium ionic liquids can dissolve even larger amounts of CO2 (on a molar fraction basis) than the corresponding imidazolium-based ILs. In particular trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide seems to be the IL with the largest CO2 sorption capacity reported up to present, revealing the potential of phosphonium-based ILs for CO2 capture.A thermodynamic model based on the Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state with the Wong\u2013Sandler mixing rule, using the UNIQUAC model for the activity coefficients, was here adopted to describe the experimental data and for the estimation of the Henry's constants.

Several commercial soft contact lenses were tested and, among these, four lenses were selected for more complete studies: Nelfilcon A (FocusDailies\u00ae, CIBA Vision), Omafilcon A (Proclear\u00ae Compatibles, CooperVision), Methafilcon A (Frequency\u00ae 55, CooperVision) and Hilafilcon B (SofLens\u00ae 59 Comfort, Bausch & Lomb). Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) was the chosen supercritical fluid and two ophthalmic drugs were tested: flurbiprofen (a NSAID, hydrophobic) and timolol maleate (an anti-glaucoma drug, hydrophilic). The effects of operational pressure, of impregnation duration and of the addition of a cosolvent (ethanol) were studied on the overall drug loading yields. Depending on the experiment, we employed pressures from 9 up to 16\u00a0MPa and impregnation times from 30 up to 180\u00a0min. Temperature was kept constant and equal to 313\u00a0K. The employed depressurization rates were kept low and between 0.1 and 0.2\u00a0MPa/min.Results are discussed in terms of the employed operational conditions and taking in consideration all the possible interactions between supercritical fluids, drugs, cosolvents and the polymers which compose the employed hydrogel contact lenses. In vitro drug release experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the resulting drug release profiles. Obtained results were also compared with drug-loaded contact lenses obtained by conventional drug \u201csoaking\u201d in aqueous solutions. Results also proved that SSI can be considered as a viable, efficient and safe alternative for the impregnation of drugs, including those of hydrophobic character or presenting low aqueous solubility, into commercial soft contact lenses. SSI proved to be a \u201ctunable\u201d process since the variation of the employed operational conditions indicated that it is possible to control the amount of impregnated drug. In the end, the ophthalmic articles were recovered undamaged and without the presence of harmful solvent residues. This method also permits to process already prepared commercial contact lenses, without interfering with their manufacture methods and, after processing, store them for future use.",

As a first step, we focus on the simulation of the heat and mass transfers of binary CO2\u2013solvent mixture in miscible conditions, based on the pioneer work developed by Werling and Debenedetti. The system is described as a spot of pure solvent immersed in pure carbon dioxide, with a mass transfer ruled by diffusion. Various correlations for expressing the diffusion coefficients are discussed, and the Hayduck\u2013Minhas is further selected for calculations; the incidence of the correlations on the droplet behaviour is also assessed. Compared to literature background, we investigate non-isothermal mixing, i.e. when temperatures of solvent and fluid are different. The evolution of the spot size is described for various conditions of pressure, temperature, temperature difference and for several CO2-mixtures frequently used in recrystallization. Results emphasize the role of temperature which can be an effective parameter to modulate the lifetimes of the droplets. In non-isothermal conditions, the immersion of a colder solvent in a warmer CO2 permits to increase the mixing time in an extend not attained by pressure or temperature in isothermal conditions; the reversed situation, e.g. a warmer solvent immersed in colder CO2, allows for speeding the mixing process.",

The IFT of both TG and FAEE decreased substantially with CO2 pressure. The IFT of FAEE vanished at elevated pressures, whereas that of TG decreased to a fairly constant level of about 2\u00a0mN/m. The IFT was correlated using a model taking into account the density, pressure and temperature of CO2, thereby facilitating the calculation of the ideal pendant drop volume as well as the surface excess concentration of CO2. In the pressure range studied, the pendant drop volume for FAEE decreased with pressure, whereas for TG it increased at elevated presssures due to the predominant effect of buoyancy. Furthermore, the change in IFT over time was determined at 55\u00a0\u00b0C for TG in contact with CO2 at pressures up to 11.4\u00a0MPa showing a decrease of IFT over time at low pressures, whereas at higher pressures it remained nearly constant. IFT influences drop formation as well as the disintegration of falling films thereby affecting the performance of separation processes.",

     "abstract": "Supercritical convective heat transfer of hydrocarbon propellants plays a key role in the regenerative cooling technology development in aerospace applications. In this paper, a numerical study of the supercritical forced convective heat transfer of a typical hydrocarbon fuel, n-heptane, has been conducted based on a complete set of conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy with accurate evaluations of the thermophysical properties. The present fundamental numerical study focuses on the effects of many key parameters, including the inlet pressure, inlet velocity, wall heat flux, and the inlet fluid temperature, on the supercritical heat transfer processes. Results indicate that under supercritical heat transfer processes, heat transfer deterioration could occur once the wall temperature or the fluid temperature in a large near-wall region reaches the pseudo-critical temperature, and increasing the fluid pressure would enhance heat transfer. The conventional empirical Gnielinski expression could only be used for supercritical heat transfer predictions of n-heptane under very limited operational conditions. It is found in the present numerical study that a supercritical heat transfer expression for CO2, H2O, and HCFC-22 applications can generally be employed for predicting the supercritical heat transfer coefficient of n-heptane when the inlet velocity is higher than 10\u00a0m/s.",

The results indicated that solvent and density were important variables for the CO2 extraction, while temperature is the most important variable for the extraction yield with propane. The extraction with propane was much faster than that with carbon dioxide due to the fact that propane is a better solvent for vegetable oils compared to carbon dioxide. On the other hand, characteristics of extracted oil, its oxidative stability determined by DSC and chemical profile of constituent fatty acids determined by gas chromatography, were similar to both solvents.

     "abstract": "Herein, we describe the use of high-pressure CO2 for the inactivation of the natural bio-burden of paprika and an evaluation of its effects on product quality. The treatments were carried out with a continuous flow of CO2 through a bed of paprika, varying the initial moisture (<35%), pressure (60\u2013300\u00a0bar), temperature (<95\u00a0\u00b0C) and exposure time (10\u2013150\u00a0min). Comparison was made with thermal treatment at the same temperature and moisture levels to isolate the effects of the CO2. It was difficult to achieve a total elimination of the highly resistant spores due to the low water activity of the medium. The paprika did not appear to exert a protective effect. Neither the use of techniques to improve the CO2\u2013paprika contact nor pressure cycling had any effect. The most influential parameters were the initial water content and temperature, presumably due to their contributions to the activation/germination of spores, making these microbes vulnerable to CO2 attack. However, we found that their values should be kept under 25\u201330% and 85\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, to avoid a loss of product quality. Pressure could be maintained at relatively low levels (60\u2013100\u00a0bar) because it did not significantly contribute to any of the possible CO2 sporicidal mechanisms and at higher values caused oleoresin extraction. Under these conditions, treatment times on the order of 30\u201345\u00a0min were sufficient to achieve the disinfection and total count reduction required by the most exigent clients. The treated paprika retained its colour category and its final humidity was within the legal levels for secure storage. Therefore, the method could be a useful alternative to traditional moist-heat treatments or hydrostatic processes.",

An equation was proposed for \u2018b\u2019 as a function of CO2 solubility and temperature while \u2018n\u2019 was a weak function of temperature. The resulting equation was much simpler that the one obtained correlating the microbial inactivation to pressure and temperature and, more important, it was independent of the suspending medium. The results indicate that the coupling of carbon dioxide solubility, also predicted with commercial software, and the use of inactivation models referred to solubility and temperature may provide a powerful instrument for the interpretation of microbial inactivation experiments and for the design of HPCD processes and equipments.",

For the debinding processes, both debinding curves showed a square root of time dependence but significantly deviated in the middle or end period of debinding because of structural changes with pores during extraction. The debinding bodies experienced capillary changes having a debinding front separating the undebinded region with fluid state into the debinding region with pendular state in the wax-based green bodies. The debinding rate of the supercritical fluid extraction was five times higher than that of the solvent extraction because of a higher interdiffusion diffusivity and a formation of relatively large pore channels. An abrupt change of pore structures between debinded and undebinded region in the green bodies caused severe defects during the solvent extraction even at a low rate of debinding at 313.15\u00a0K, while the severity of the capillary changes was overcome during the supercritical fluid extraction and the debinded ceramic bodies were free from defects even at a high rate of debinding at 328.15\u00a0K.

The composition of these three phases is computed in terms of fractions of CH4, H2, H2O, CO, CO2, H2S, NH3, C6H5OH, CH3COOH, CH3CHO, C(s) and minerals. In the reactor, this composition is computed according to the derivation of balance equations on atoms and to the derivation of equations translating chemical equilibrium between species. Because of the specific conditions prevailing in this device (above the critical point of pure water), the computation of the activity of chemical species in the reacting media is performed using Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state. The modelling of the separator is performed using mass balances as well as equations translating physical equilibrium of species between liquid and gaseous phases.

The flow rate, 7\u00a0ml/min; spray distance, 7\u00a0cm; pre-expansion temperature, 95\u00a0\u00b0C were found to be the optimum conditions to achieve the minimum particle size of digitoxin.",

     "abstract": "Micronized camptothecin (CPT) is prepared with a supercritical antisolvent (SAS) apparatus using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent and carbon dioxide as antisolvent. Four factors, namely CPT solution concentration and flow rate, precipitation temperature and pressure are optimized by a four-level orthogonal array design (OAD). By analysis of variance (ANOVA), only precipitation pressure has a significant effect on the MPS of micronized CPT. The optimum micronization conditions are determined as follows: CPT solution concentration 1.25\u00a0mg/ml, CPT solution flow rate 6.6\u00a0ml/min, precipitation temperature 35\u00a0\u00b0C and precipitation pressure 20\u00a0MPa. Under the optimum conditions, micronized CPT with a MPS of 0.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.020\u00a0\u03bcm is obtained. The micronized CPT obtained was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), High performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential scanning calorimeters (DSC) and Gas chromatography (GC) analyses. The results showed that the obtained CPT particles have lower crystallinity and SAS micronization process does not induce degradation of CPT. In addition, the residual DMSO is less than the ICH limit for class 3 solvents.",

     "abstract": "Creating polymer foams with controlled pore size and pore density is an important part of controlling foam properties. The addition of nanoparticles has been shown to cause heterogeneous nucleation and can be used to reduce pore size. In the current study, the effects of filler size and filler surface chemistry on pore nucleation in silica/PMMA nanocomposites are investigated. It was found that as the nanofiller size decreased, the pore density increased by a factor of 2\u20133 decades compared to that of unfilled PMMA (pore cell densities above 1012\u00a0cells/cm3 were obtained). In addition, fluorination of the silica nanoparticle surface led to decreased pore size without changing the degree of silica aggregation and overall density. By monitoring the pore density as a function of pressure, a qualitative comparison was obtained that showed that fluorination of the nanoparticle reduced the critical free energy of nucleation.",
