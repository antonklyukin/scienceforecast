     "abstract": "Juglone is a naphthoquinone currently obtained by chemical synthesis with biological activities including antitumor activity. Additionally, juglone is present in the green husk of walnut, which suggests evaluating the effect of GH extracts on carcinogenic cell lines.Walnut green husk ethanolic extract was obtained as 169.1 mg juglone/100 g Green Husk and antioxidant activity (ORAC) of 44,920 \u03bcmol Trolox Equivalent/100 g DW Green Husk. At 1 \u03bcM juglone in HL-60 cell culture, green husk extract showed an antiproliferative effect, but pure juglone did not; under these conditions, normal fibroblast cells were not affected. A dose-dependent effect on mitochondrial membrane potential loss was observed. Apoptosis of HL-60 was detected at 10 \u03bcM juglone. Despite high ORAC values, neither purified juglone nor the extract showed protective effects on HL-60 cells under oxidative conditions.Green husk extract generates an antiproliferative effect in HL-60 cells, which is related to an induction of the early stages of apoptosis and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The normal cells were not affected when juglone is present at concentrations of 1 \u03bcM, while at higher concentrations, there is loss of viability of both cancerous and healthy cells.How to cite: Soto-Maldonado C, Vergara-Castro M, Jara-Quezada J, et al.

Oscillatoria cyanobacteria were modified by starch/nZVI and starch/graphene oxide in a bubble column bioreactor, and their bioremoval efficiency was investigated. Modifiers, namely, starch/zero-valent iron and starch/GO, increased trinitrophenol bioremoval efficiency by more than 10% and 12%, respectively, as compared to the use of Oscillatoria cyanobacteria alone.It was found that starch/nano zero-valent iron and starch/GO could be applied to improve the removal rate of phenolic compounds from the aqueous solution.How to cite: Bavandi R, Emtyazjoo M, Saravi HN, et al.

     "abstract": "Drought is the major factor that limits faba bean (Vicia faba L.) production worldwide. To decipher the molecular basis of drought stress response, we carried out transcriptome profiling of the drought-tolerant genotype of faba bean (Vicia faba L.), Hassawi-2, under drought stress conditions using RNA sequencing.De novo assembly of a total of 606.35 M high-quality pair-end clean reads yielded 164,679 unigenes of leaf tissues. A total of 35,143 (12,805 upregulated and 22,338 downregulated unigenes) and 28,892 (16,247 upregulated and 12,645 down-regulated) genes were differentially expressed under drought stress conditions in the vegetative and flowering stages, respectively. According to the GO and KEGG databases, both the vegetative and flowering stages regulated energy metabolism, transmembrane transporter activity, and secondary metabolites. A total of 538 (272 upregulated and 266 downregulated) and 642 (300 upregulated and 342 downregulated) putative transcription factors in the vegetative and flowering stages, respectively, were identified and classified under different transcription factor families. In addition, a substantial proportion of DEGs identified here were novel, as they could not be mapped to any functional database, therefore suggesting a specific response to drought stress in faba bean. The RNA-seq results were also validated by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis.The transcriptome data generated here using RNA sequencing is the first report of faba bean under drought stress indicating the genes involved in drought tolerance. This information can be used to improve drought tolerance in elite faba bean cultivars and to develop tolerant germplasm for other legume crops.How to cite: Khan MA, Alghamdi SS, Ammar MH, et al.

     "abstract": "A total of 62,591 cowpea expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were BLAST aligned to the whole-genome sequence of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) to develop conserved intron scanning primers (CISPs). The efficacy of the primers was tested across 10 different legumes and on different varieties of cowpea, chickpea, and pigeon pea. Genetic diversity was assessed using the same primers on different cowpea genotypes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, which were later converted to length polymorphism markers for easy genotyping. CISPs developed in this study were used in tagging resistance to bacterial leaf blight disease in cowpea.A total of 1262 CISPs were designed. The single-copy amplification success rates using these primers on 10 different legumes and on different varieties of cowpea, chickpea, and pigeon pea were approximately 60% in most of the legumes except soybean (47%) and peanut (37%). Genetic diversity analysis of 35 cowpea genotypes using 179 CISPs revealed 123 polymorphic markers with PIC values ranging from 0.05 to 0.59. Potential SNPs identified in cowpea, chickpea, and pigeon pea were converted to PCR primers of various sizes for easy genotyping. Using the markers developed in this study, a genetic linkage map was constructed with 11 linkage groups in cowpea. QTL mapping with 194\u202fF3 progeny families derived from the cross C-152\u202f\u00d7\u202fV-16 resulted in the identification of three QTLs for resistance to bacterial leaf blight disease.CISPs were proved to be efficient markers to identify various other marker classes like SNPs through comparative genomic studies in lesser studied crops and to aid in systematic sampling of the entire genome for well-distributed markers at low cost.How to cite: Bi R, Chandappa LH, Siddalingaiah L, et al.

     "abstract": "Microbial oils produced by diverse microorganisms are being considered as alternative sources of triglycerides for biodiesel production. However, the standalone production of biodiesel from microorganisms is not currently economically feasible. In case of yeasts, the use of low-value nutrient sources in microbial production and the implementation of cost-efficient downstream processes could reduce costs and make microbial lipids competitive with other commodity-type oils in biodiesel production. Industrial biodiesel synthesis from oleaginous seeds is currently based on a multistep process. However, a simple process called in situ transesterification (ISTE), which takes place within the biomass without a previous lipid extraction step, is receiving increasing interest. In this work, the optimal conditions for an ISTE process to obtain biodiesel from previously selected oleaginous yeast (Rhodotorula graminis S1/S2) were defined using the response surface methodology (RSM).Using the RSM approach, the optimal conditions for the maximum yield with minimum reaction time included a methanol-to-biomass ratio of 60:1, 0.4\u202fM H2SO4, and incubation at 70\u00b0C for 3\u202fh. The optimized in situ process yield was significantly higher (123%) than that obtained with a two-step method in which fatty acids from saponifiable lipids were first extracted and then esterified with methanol. The composition of the fatty acid methyl ester mixture obtained from R. graminis S1/S2 by ISTE met Uruguayan standards for biodiesel.The characteristics achieved by the optimized method make microbial oil a potential alternative for biodiesel production from yeast at an industrial scale.How to cite: Martinez-Silveira A, Villarreal R, Garmendia G, et al.

However, current treatments have numerous side effects, and drugs from natural sources may have better therapeutic potential. This research investigated the induction of apoptosis by \u03b1-hederin (\u03b1-HN), a constituent of Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regel, in the oral cancer cell line SCC-25 and its underlying mechanism.SCC-25 cells were treated with 50, 100, and 200\u202f\u03bcmol/L \u03b1-HN. Cell proliferation; extent of apoptosis; activities of caspases-3, 8, and 9; and the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, phosphorylated (p)-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt, and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) proteins were determined using the 3-(4,5)-2-thiazole-(2,5)-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, flow cytometry, caspase activity detection kits, and western blot assays, respectively. The results showed that the proliferation of SCC-25 cells in the \u03b1-HN-treated groups decreased significantly, and the inhibitory effect was time and concentration dependent. Compared with cells in the control group, the extent of apoptosis increased significantly, caspase-3 and -9 activities were significantly enhanced, and the Bcl-2 level was lowered and the Bax level was elevated significantly in SCC-25 cells treated with \u03b1-HN for 48\u202fh (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR was also significantly lower in SCC-25 cells treated with \u03b1-HN than that in the control group (P\u202f<\u202f0.05).These results indicate that \u03b1-HN can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of SCC-25 cells and may exert these effects by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.How to cite: Wang H, Wu B, Wang H.

     "abstract": "Eugenol is an economically favorable substrate for the microbial biotransformation of aromatic compounds. Coniferyl aldehyde is one kind of aromatic compound that is widely used in condiment and medical industries; it is also an important raw material for producing other valuable products such as vanillin and protocatechuic acid. However, in most eugenol biotransformation processes, only a trace amount of coniferyl aldehyde is detected, thus making these processes economically unattractive. As a result, an investigation of new strains with the capability of producing more coniferyl aldehyde from eugenol is required.We screened a novel strain of Gibberella fujikuroi, labeled as ZH-34, which was capable of transforming eugenol to coniferyl aldehyde. The metabolic pathway was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and transformation kinetics. The culture medium and biotransformation conditions were optimized. At a 6\u202fh time interval of eugenol fed-batch strategy, 3.76\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.22\u202fg/L coniferyl aldehyde was obtained, with the corresponding yield of 57.3%.This work improves the yield of coniferyl aldehyde with a biotechnological approach.

In addition, the biomolecule was characterized, and its efficiency in removing petroderivatives from marine soil was investigated.A 22 factorial design was applied, and the best condition for producing the biosurfactant was determined in assay 4 (3% CG and 5% CSL). The biosurfactant reduced the surface tension of water from 72 to 28.8\u202fmN/m and produced a yield of 1.74\u202fg/L. The preliminary biochemical characterization showed that the biosurfactant consisted of proteins (38.0%), carbohydrates (35.4%), and lipids (5.5%). The compounds presented an anionic character, nontoxicity, and great stability for all conditions tested. The biomolecule displayed great ability in dispersing hydrophobic substrates in water, thereby resulting in 53.4\u202fcm2 ODA. The best efficiency of the biosurfactant in removing the pollutant diesel oil from marine soil was 79.4%.This study demonstrated the ability of R. arrhizus UCP1607 to produce a low-cost biosurfactant characterized as a glycoprotein and its potential use in the bioremediation of the hydrophobic diesel oil pollutant in marine soil.How to cite: Pele MA, Ribeaux DR, Vieira ER, et al.

     "abstract": "Malolactic fermentation (MLF) is a process in winemaking responsible for the conversion of l-malic acid to l-lactic acid and CO2, which reduces the total acidity, improves the biological stability, and modifies the aroma profile of wine. MLF takes place during or after alcoholic fermentation and is carried out by one or more species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which are either present in grapes and cellars or inoculated with malolactic starters during the winemaking process. Although the main bacterium among LAB used in commercial starter cultures for MLF has traditionally been Oenococcus oeni, in the last decade, Lactobacillus plantarum has also been reported as a malolactic starter, and many works have shown that this species can survive and even grow under harsh conditions of wine (i.e., high ethanol content and low pH values). Furthermore, it has been proved that some strains of L. plantarum are able to conduct MLF just as efficiently as O. oeni. In addition, L. plantarum exhibits a more diverse enzymatic profile than O. oeni, which could play an important role in the modification of the wine aroma profile. This enzymatic diversity allows obtaining several starter cultures composed of different L. plantarum biotypes, which could result in distinctive wines. In this context, this review focuses on showing the relevance of L. plantarum as a MLF starter culture in winemaking.How to cite: Brizuela NS, Tymczyszyn E, Semorile LC, et al.

The present study aimed at the possibility of accelerating the process of breeding new cultivars, resistant to eyespot, by using doubled haploids (DH) system supported by marker-assisted selection.Two highly resistant breeding lines (KBP 0916 and KBH 4942/05) carrying Pch1 gene were crossed with the elite wheat genotypes. Hybrid plants of early generations were analyzed using endopeptidase EpD1 and two SSR markers linked to the Pch1 locus. Selected homozygous and heterozygous genotypes for the Pch1-linked EpD1b allele were used to produce haploid plants. Molecular analyses were performed on haploids to identify plants possessing Pch1 gene. Chromosome doubling was performed only on haploid plants with Pch1 gene. Finally, 65 DH lines carrying eyespot resistance gene Pch1 and 30 lines without this gene were chosen for the eyespot resistance phenotyping in a field experiment.Results of the experiment confirmed higher resistance to eyespot of the genotypes with Pch1 in comparison to those without this gene.

     "abstract": "The 11S globulin from amaranth is the most abundant storage protein in mature seeds and is well recognized for its nutritional value. We used this globulin to engineer a new protein by adding a four valine-tyrosine antihypertensive peptide at its C-terminal end to improve its functionality. The new protein was named AMR5 and expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL strain using a custom medium (F8PW) designed for this work.The alternative medium allowed for the production of 652\u202fmg/L expressed protein at the flask level, mostly in an insoluble form, and this protein was subjected to in vitro refolding. The spectrometric analysis suggests that the protein adopts a \u03b2/\u03b1 structure with a small increment of \u03b1-helix conformation relative to the native amaranth 11S globulin. Thermal and urea denaturation experiments determined apparent Tm and C1/2 values of 50.4\u00b0C and 3.04\u202fM, respectively, thus indicating that the antihypertensive peptide insertion destabilized the modified protein relative to the native one. AMR5 hydrolyzed by trypsin and chymotrypsin showed 14- and 1.3-fold stronger inhibitory activity against angiotensin I-converting enzyme (IC50 of 0.034\u202fmg/mL) than the unmodified protein and the previously reported amaranth acidic subunit modified with antihypertensive peptides, respectively.The inserted peptide decreases the structural stability of amaranth 11S globulin and improves its antihypertensive activity.How to cite: Espinosa-Hern\u00e1ndez E, Morales-Camacho JI, Fern\u00e1ndez-Velasco DA, et al.

     "abstract": "Ammonium stress is a prime limiting phenomenon that occurs during methane formation from poultry manure. It is caused by elevated ammonium nitrogen concentrations that result from substrate decomposition. The amounts of methane formed depend on the activity of methanogenic microbes.During the research reported in this paper, the response of a mesophilic consortium inhabiting a biogas reactor to rising load of poultry manure was investigated. The taxonomic composition of bacterial population was mostly typical, however syntrophic bacteria were not detected. This absence resulted in limitation of succession of some methanogenic microorganisms, especially obligate hydrogenotrophs. The methanogenic activity of the consortium was totally dependent on the activity of Methanosaeta. Inhibition of methanoganesis was noticed at ammonium nitrogen concentration of 3.68\u202fg/L, total cessation occurred at 5.45\u202fg/L. Significant amounts of acetic acid in the fermentation pulp accompanied the inhibition.The effectiveness of the consortium was totally dependent on the metabolic activity of the acetoclastic Methanoseata genus and lack of SAOB did not allow hydrogenotrophic methanogens to propagate and lead to cessation of biogas production at an elevated ammonium concentration at which acetoclastic methanogens were inhibited.How to cite: \u015awi\u0105tek M, Lewicki A, Szymanowska D, et al.

     "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most frequent degenerative joint diseases with high rate of disability, but its mode of action remains largely unclear. The current study was aimed at identifying key genes and molecular mechanism in OA. Gene expression datasets (GSE1919, GSE55235, GSE55457) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus for integrated bioinformatics analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OA synovial tissues were identified using GeoDiver and GEO2R. Gene ontology enrichment analyses were undertaken via FunRich and Metascape. Also, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed using miRWalk3.0. Subsequently, pathways interrelation analysis of hub genes was carried out using plug-in ClueGO v2.3.3. Additionally, circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA regulatory networks were visualized using Cytoscape.A total of 508 DEGs were obtained from three GSE datasets, of these five intersection DEGs (TNFAIP3, VEGFA, GADD45B, SIK1, KLF9) were shared by three GSE datasets. Intersection DEGs were significantly enriched in LKB1 signaling events, signaling events mediated by focal adhesion kinase, and PDGFR-beta signaling pathway. Enrichment analysis for all the DEGs showed that they mainly enriched in inflammatory response, cytokine production, blood vessel development, stress response, osteoclast differentiation, and MAPK signaling pathway. A total of 39 genes were regarded as hub genes and pathways interrelation analysis indicated that hub genes mainly enriched in TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway.The current study revealed the potential key genes, pathways, and circRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA regulatory networks in OA, which may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of OA pathogenesis.How to cite: Li HZ, Xu XH, Lu HD.

     "abstract": "Science and technology are two desirable elements for the economic and social development of a country. Biotechnology has a particularly important potential for economic development. Nevertheless, patent production in Latin America remains underdeveloped, which creates the need to analyze its trend and the efforts made to promote patent production. Therefore, the purpose of this study was, on the one hand, to determine trends in biotechnology-related PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) applications in Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba from 1999 to 2015, and, on the other hand, to determine whether there is a relationship between the gross domestic expenditure on research and experimental development as a percentage of gross domestic product (GERD/GDP) and PCT applications for biotechnological inventions from 2007 to 2015 (in this case, the period under study was limited from 2007 to 2015, due to data availability for GERD/GDP in the five selected countries).The first part of this study shows that the growth in biotechnology PCT applications has been moderate and gradual and the trend was fitted to a linear model. The second set of results shows that GERD/GDP is associated with biotechnology-related PCT applications issued during the study period with a significance level of \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.01.Even though results indicate a gradual and modest progress, it is necessary that these five representative Latin American nations continue acting toward the protection of intellectual property in the area of biotechnology, especially by configuring strategies for further progress based on investments on research and development.How to cite: Barrag\u00e1n-Oca\u00f1a A, G\u00f3mez-Viquez H, Merritt H, et al.

The role of SCP as a safe food and feed is being highlighted more because of the worldwide protein scarcity. Even though SCP has been successfully commercialized in the UK for decades, study of optimal fermentation conditions, various potential substrates, and a broad range of microorganisms is still being pursued by many researchers. In this article, commonly used methods for the production of SCP and different fermentation systems are briefly reviewed, with submerged fermentation being highlighted as a more commonly used method.

     "abstract": "Heavy metals are natural elements in the Earth\u2019s crust that can enter human food through industrial or agricultural processing, in the form of fertilizers and pesticides. These elements are not biodegradable. Some heavy metals are known as pollutants and are toxic, and their bioaccumulation in plant and animal tissues can cause undesirable effects for humans; therefore, their amount in water and food should always be under control. The aim of this study is to investigate the conditions for the bioremediation of heavy metals in foods. Various physical, chemical, and biological methods have been used to reduce the heavy metal content in the environment. During the last decades, bioremediation methods using plants and microorganisms have created interest to researchers for their advantages such as being more specific and environmentally friendly. The main pollutant elements in foods and beverages are lead, cadmium, arsenic, and mercury, which have their own permissible limits. Among the microorganisms that are capable of bioremediation of heavy metals, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an interesting choice for its special characteristics and being safe for humans, which make it quite common and useful in the food industry. Its mass production as the byproduct of the fermentation industry and the low cost of culture media are the other advantages. The ability of this yeast to remove an individual separated element has also been widely investigated. In countries with high heavy metal pollution in wheat, the use of S. cerevisiae is a native solution for overcoming the problem of solution.This article summarizes the main conditions for heavy metal absorption by S. cerevisiae.How to cite: Massoud R, Hadiani MR, Khosravi Darani K, et al.

     "abstract": "Osmanthus fragrans is an important ornamental tree and has been widely planted in China because of its pleasant aroma, which is mainly due to terpenes. The monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid metabolic pathways of sweet osmanthus have been well studied. However, these studies were mainly focused on volatile small molecule compounds. The molecular regulation mechanism of synthesis of large molecule compounds (triterpenoids) remains unclear. Squalene synthase (SQS), squalene epoxidase (SQE), and beta-amyrin synthase (BETA-AS) are three critical enzymes of the triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway.In this study, the full-length cDNA and gDNA sequences of OfSQS, OfSQE, and OfBETA-AS were isolated from sweet osmanthus. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OfSQS and OfSQE had the closest relationship with Sesamum indicum, and OfBETA-AS sequence shared the highest similarity of 99% with that of Olea europaea. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the three genes were highly expressed in flowers, especially OfSQE and OfBETA-AS, which were predominantly expressed in the flowers of both \u201cBoye\u201d and \u201cRixiang\u201d cultivars, suggesting that they might play important roles in the accumulation of triterpenoids in flowers of O. fragrans. Furthermore, the expression of OfBETA-AS in the two cultivars was significantly different during all the five flowering stages; this suggested that OfBETA-AS may be the critical gene for the differences in the accumulation of triterpenoids.The evidence indicates that OfBETA-AS could be the key gene in the triterpenoid synthesis pathway, and it could also be used as a critical gene resource in the synthesis of essential oils by using bioengineered bacteria.How to cite: Yang X, Ding W, Yue Y, et al.

     "abstract": "Flavonoids are a kind of important secondary metabolite and are commonly considered to provide protection to plants against stress and UV-B for a long time. Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), which encodes a dioxygenase in the flavonoid pathway, catalyzes the conversion of leucoanthocyanidins to anthocyanidins, but there is no direct evidence indicating that it provides tolerance to stress in plants.To investigate whether ANS can increase tolerance to abiotic stress, MaANS was isolated from mulberry fruits and transformed into tobacco. Our results suggested that the bacterially expressed MaANS protein can convert dihydroquercetin to quercetin. Overexpression of MaANS remarkably increased the accumulation of total flavonoids in transgenic lines and anthocyanins in corollas of flowers. Transgenic lines showed higher tolerance to NaCl and mannitol stress.These results indicated that MaANS participates in various dioxygenase activities, and it can protect plants against abiotic stress by improving the ROS-scavenging ability. Thus, this alternative approach in crop breeding can be considered in the improvement of stress tolerance by enriching flavonoid production in plants.How to cite: Li J, Zhao A, Yu M, et al.

     "abstract": "Taraxacum officinale G.H. Weber ex Wiggers is a wild plant used in folk medicine to treat several diseases owing to bioactive secondary metabolites present in its tissue. The accumulation of such molecules in plant cells can occur as a response against abiotic stress, but these metabolites are often deposited in low concentrations. For this reason, the use of a biotechnological approach to improve the yields of technologically interesting bioactive compounds such as anthocyanins is a compelling option. This work focuses on investigating the potential of in vitro T. officinale cultures as an anthocyanin source.To demonstrate the suitability of anthocyanin induction and accumulation in calluses under specific conditions, anthocyanin was induced in the T. officinale callus. A specific medium of 5.5% sucrose supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine /1-naphthaleneacetic acid in a 10:1 ratio was used to produce an anthocyanin yield of 1.23 mg g-1 fw. An in vitro dandelion callus line was established from this experiment. Five mathematical models were then used to objectively and predictably explain the growth of anthocyanin-induced calluses from T. officinale. Of these models, the Richards model offered the most suitable representation of anthocyanin callus growth in a solid medium and permitted the calculation of the corresponding kinetic parameters.The findings demonstrate the potential of an in vitro anthocyanin-induced callus line from T. officinale as an industrial anthocyanin source.How to cite: Mart\u00ednez ME, Poirrier P, Pr\u00fcfer D, et al.

Herein, the bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa, which secretes arabinofuranosidase with high activity, was selected for enzyme production, purification, and characterization.Medium components and cultural conditions were optimized by the response surface method using shake flask cultures. Arabinofuranosidase production reached 25.2\u202fU/mL under optimized conditions, which were pH\u202f7.5, 28\u00b0C, and a basic medium supplemented with 1.5\u202fg/L mannitol and 3.5\u202fg/L soymeal. Furthermore, the arabinofuranosidase secreted by P. polymyxa, named as PpAFase-1, was partially purified from the supernatant using a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column and a hydroxyapatite column. The approximate molecular mass of the purified PpAFase-1 was determined as 56.8\u202fkDa by SDS-PAGE. Protein identification by mass spectrometry analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequence had significant similarity to the glycosyl hydrolase family 51. The deduced gene of 1515\u202fbp was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Purified recombinant PpAFase-1 was active toward p-nitrophenyl-\u03b1-l-arabinofuranoside (pNPAraf). The Km and kcat values toward pNPAraf were 0.81\u202fmM and 53.2\u202fs\u22121, respectively. When wheat arabinoxylan and oat spelt xylan were used as substrates, PpAFase-1 showed poor efficiency. However, a synergistic effect was observed when PpAFase-1 was combined with xylanase from Thermomyces lanuginosus.A novel GH51 enzyme PpAFase-1 was cloned from the genome of P. polymyxa and expressed in E. coli.

The identification of promoter elements responsible for SERK1 expression during the onset of somatic embryogenesis can be useful to understand the molecular regulation of the cell-to embryo transition, and these promoter elements represent biotechnological tools in plant organ tissue culture.A \u2212\u00a01,620\u202fbp DNA sequence located upstream of the Coffea canephora SERK1 gene homologue (CcSERK1) was isolated, and then, different segments containing key response elements (REs) for somatic embryogenesis onset and development were fused to the uidA (encoding a \u03b2-glucuronidase, GUS) reporter gene to evaluate its expression in transgenic leaf explants. DNA segments of \u2212\u00a01,620 and \u2212\u00a01048\u202fbp in length directed uidA expression with patterns in leaf explants similar to those occurring during somatic embryogenesis. When a \u2212\u00a0792-bp fragment was used, uidA expression disappeared only in leaf explants and pro-embryogenic mass but persisted in developing embryos. No uidA expression was detected in any embryogenic stage when a \u2212\u00a0618-bp fragment was used.DNA deletions showed that a \u2212\u00a01048-bp sequence located upstream of the CcSERK1 gene is sufficient to direct gene expression during the onset and the development of C. canephora somatic embryogenesis. The DNA segment located between \u2212\u00a01048 and \u2212\u00a0792\u202fbp (containing BBM and WUS REs) is needed for gene expression before embryogenesis onset but not during embryo development.

In this work, we purified and characterized a new type C A. ochraceus feruloyl esterase (AocFaeC), which synthesized specifically butyl hydroxycinnamates in a ternary solvent system.AocFaeC was produced by solid state fermentation, reaching its maximal activity (1.1\u202fU/g) after 48\u202fh of culture. After purification, the monomeric protein (34\u202fkDa) showed a specific activity of 57.9\u202fU/mg towards methyl ferulate. AocFaeC biochemical characterization confirmed its identity as a type C feruloyl esterase and suggested the presence of a catalytic serine in the active site. Its maximum hydrolytic activity was achieved at 40\u00b0C and pH\u202f6.5 and increased by 109 and 77% with Ca2\u00a0+ and Mg2\u00a0+, but decreased by 90 and 45% with Hg2\u00a0+ and Cu2\u00a0+, respectively. The initial butyl ferulate synthesis rate increased from 0.8 to 23.7\u202fnmol/min after transesterification condition improvement, using an isooctane:butanol:water ternary solvent system, surprisingly the synthesis activity using other alcohols was negligible.

Our study describes Escherichia coli production and characterization of a moderately thermostable LDH (LDH-GT) from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans DSM-465. An in silico 3D model of recombinant enzyme and molecular docking with a set of potential inhibitors are also described.The recombinant enzyme was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The molecular weight of the enzyme determined by MALDI-TOF was 34,798.96\u202fDa. It exhibited maximum activity at 65\u00b0C and pH\u202f7.5 with a KM value for pyruvate as 45\u202f\u03bcM.

     "abstract": "Pollen development is an important reproductive process that directly affects pollen fertility and grain yield in rice. Argonaute (AGO) proteins, the core effectors of RNA-mediated silencing, play important roles in regulating plant growth and development. However, few AGO proteins in rice were reported to be involved in pollen development. In this study, artificial microRNA technology was used to assess the function of OsAGO17 in pollen development.In this study, OsAGO17, a rice-specific gene, was specifically expressed in rice pollen grains, with the highest expression in uninucleate microspores. Downregulation of OsAGO17 by artificial microRNA technology based on the endogenous osa-miRNA319a precursor was successfully achieved. It is found that downregulation of OsAGO17 could significantly affect pollen fertility and cause pollen abortion, thus suggesting that OsAGO17 functions in rice pollen development. In addition, the downregulation of OsAGO17 mainly caused a low seed-setting rate, thereby resulting in the reduction of grain yield, whereas the downregulation of OsAGO17 did not significantly affect rice vegetative growth and other agricultural traits including number of florets per panicle, number of primary branch per panicle, and 100-grain weight. Furthermore, the result of subcellular localization analysis indicated that the OsAGO17 protein was localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.These results represent the first report of the biological function for OsAGO17 in rice and indicate that OsAGO17 may possibly play crucial regulatory roles in rice pollen development. It helps us to better understand the mechanism of pollen development in rice.How to cite: Yao, M., Ai, T.B., Mao, Q., et al.

     "abstract": "Anaerobic digestion is an alternative bioprocess used to treat effluents containing toxic compounds such as phenol and p-cresol. Selection of an adequate sludge as inoculum containing an adapted microbial consortium is a relevant factor to improve the removal of these pollutants. The objective of this study is to identify the key microorganisms involved in the anaerobic digestion of phenol and p-cresol and elucidate the relevance of the bamA gene abundance (a marker gene for aromatic degraders) in the process, in order to establish new strategies for inocula selection and improve the system's performance.Successive batch anaerobic digestion of phenol and p-cresol was performed using granular or suspended sludge. Granular sludge in comparison to suspended sludge showed higher degradation rates both for phenol (11.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7 vs 8.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.1\u202fmg\u202fl-1\u202fd-1) and p-cresol (7.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4 vs 3.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202fmg\u202fl-1\u202fd-1). After three and four re-feedings of phenol and p-cresol, respectively, the microbial structure from both sludges was clearly different from the original sludges. Anaerobic digestion of phenol and p-cresol generated an abundance increase in Syntrophorhabdus genus and bamA gene, together with hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic archaea. Analysis of results indicates that differences in methanogenic pathways and levels of Syntrophorhabdus and bamA gene in the inocula, could be the causes of dissimilar degradation rates between each sludge.Syntrophorhabdus and bamA gene play relevant roles in anaerobic degradation of phenolics. Estimation of these components could serve as a fast screening tool to find the most acclimatized sludge to efficiently degrade mono-aromatic compounds.How to cite: Franchi O, Rosenkranz F, Chamy R.

An investigation aimed at purifying, characterizing, elucidating the mode of action, and enhancing the production of salivaricin from Lactobacillus salivarius of human gut origin was conducted.Salivaricin mmaye1 is a novel bacteriocin purified from L. salivarius isolated from human feces. It is potent at micromolar concentrations and has a molecular weight of 1221.074\u202fDa as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. It has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Salivaricin mmaye1 showed high thermal and chemical stability and moderate pH stability. The proteinaceous nature of salivaricin mmaye1 was revealed by the complete loss of activity after treatment with pepsin, trypsin, \u03b1-chymotrypsin, protease, and proteinase. Salivaricin mmaye1 is cell wall associated, and adsorption\u2013desorption of the bacteriocin from the cell wall of the producer by pH modification proved successful. It exhibited a bactericidal mode of action mediated by pore formation. Its biosynthesis is regulated by a quorum sensing mechanism. Enhanced production of salivaricin mmaye1 was achieved in a newly developed growth medium.A novel, cell wall adhering, highly potent bacteriocin with a broad spectrum of inhibitory activity, membrane-permeabilizing ability, and enhanced production in a newly constituted medium has been isolated. It has a quorum sensing regulatory system and possesses interesting physicochemical characteristics favoring its future use in food biopreservation.

     "abstract": "Tamarix ramosissima is a desert forest tree species that is widely distributed in the drought-stricken areas to sustain the fragile ecosystem. Owing to its wide usage in the desert restoration of Asia, it can be used as an ecophysiological model plant. To obtain reliable and accurate results, a set of reference genes should be screened before gene expression. However, up to date, systematical evaluation of reference genes has not been conducted in T. ramosissima.In this study, we used eigenvalues derived from principal component analysis to identify stable expressed genes from 72,035 unigenes from diurnal transcriptomes under natural field conditions. With combined criteria of read counts above 900 and CV of FPKM below 0.3, a total of 7385 unigenes could be qualified as candidate reference genes in T. ramosissima. By using three statistical algorithm packages, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, the stabilities of these novel reference genes were further compared with a panel of traditional reference genes. The expression patterns of three aquaporins (AQPs) suggested that at least UBQ (high expression), EIF4A2 (low expression), and GAPDH (moderate expression) could be qualified as ideal reference genes in both RT-PCR and RNA-seq analysis of T. ramosissima.This work will not only facilitate future studies on gene expression and functional analysis of genetic resources of desert plants but also improve our understanding of the molecular regulation of water transport in this plant, which could provide a new clue to further investigate the drought adaptation mechanism of desert plant species under harsh environments.How to cite: Yan X, Qian C, Yin X, et al.

The knowledge of plant epigenetic and genetic variations can contribute to enhance the production of bioactive compounds. These issues have been little explored thus far in Rorippa nasturtium var. aquaticum L. (watercress), an edible and medicinal plant. The aim of the current study was to determine and compare the phenolic composition and epigenetic and genetic variations between wild and cultivated watercress.Significant differences were found in the quantitative phenolic composition between wild and cultivated watercress. The eight primer combinations used in the methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) method revealed different epigenetic status for each watercress type, the cultivated one being the most epigenetically variable. The genetic variability revealed by the EcoRI/MspI amplification profile and also by eight inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers was different between the two types of watercress. The results of the Mantel test showed that the correlation between genetic and epigenetic variations has diminished in the cultivated type. Cluster analyses showed that the epigenetic and genetic characterizations clearly discriminated between wild and cultivated watercress.Relevant chemical, epigenetic, and genetic differences have emerged between wild and cultivated watercress. These differences can contribute to fingerprint and develop quality control tools for the integral and safety use and the commercialization of watercress.

Endo-1, 4-\u03b2-glucanases (Egl) is one of the major enzyme involved in degradation of cellulose, an important component of plant cell wall. The present study was aimed at enhancing the production of endo-1, 4-\u03b2-glucanases (Egl) of Bacillus halodurans in Escherichia coli.A putative Egl gene of Bacillus Halodurans was expressed in E. coli by cloning in pET 22b (+). On induction with isopropyl-b-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, the enzyme expression reached upto ~\u00a020% of the cell protein producing 29.2\u202fmg/liter culture. An increase in cell density to 12 in auto-inducing LB medium (absorbance at 600\u202fnm) enhanced \u03b2-glucanase production up to 5.4 fold. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 39\u202fKDa, which is nearly the same as the calculated value.

     "abstract": "Astaxanthin from natural sources is typically esterified with fatty acids; hence, it must be hydrolyzed to remove esters before identification and quantification by conventional HPLC. Alkaline-catalyzed saponification and enzyme-catalyzed enzymolysis are the most commonly used de-esterification methods. However, information on the efficiency and isomerization during de-esterification of natural astaxanthin esters by these two methods remains scarce. Therefore, we conducted two HPLC-based experiments to determine which method is better for hydrolyzing astaxanthin esters.To assess the effect of enzymolysis (0.67\u202fU/mL cholesterol esterase, at 37\u00b0C) and saponification (0.021\u202fM NaOH, at 5\u00b0C) conditions on free astaxanthin recovery and destruction or structural transformation of astaxanthin, we varied the total treatment time across a range of 195\u202fmin. The results showed that enzymolysis and saponification were complete in 60\u202fmin and 90\u202fmin, respectively. After complete hydrolysis, the maximum free astaxanthin recovery obtained by enzymolysis was 42.6% more than that obtained by saponification. The identification of by-products, semi-astacene and astacene, during the process of saponification also indicated that a more severe degradation of astaxanthin occurred during saponification. Moreover, the composition of astaxanthin isomers during saponification was similar to that of the isomers during enzymolysis between 30\u202fmin and 75\u202fmin (all-trans:9-cis:13-cis\u202f=\u202f21:3:1, approximately) but dramatically changed after 90\u202fmin, whereas the composition in the enzymolysis treatment remained relatively stable throughout.Compared with saponification, enzymolysis with cholesterol esterase was recommended as a more accurate method for de-esterification of natural astaxanthin esters for further qualitative and quantitative HPLC analysis.How to cite: Su F, Xu H, Yang N, et al.

     "abstract": "All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a vitamin A-derived active metabolite, exerts important functions in hair biology. Previous studies indicated that excess ATRA hampered hair follicle morphogenesis and cyclic regeneration in adulthood, but other studies stated that ATRA promoted hair growth. Dermal papilla (DP), a cluster of specialized fibroblasts, plays pivotal roles in controlling development and regeneration of hair follicle. Several lines of evidence indicated that DP might be the target cells of ATRA in the hair follicle. To confirm this hypothesis, the present study was performed to explore the biological effects of ATRA on goat dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and clarify the roles of ATRA in hair biology.Our experimental results indicated that key signaling transducers of ATRA were dynamically expressed in distinct stages of goat cashmere growth cycle, and high-dose ATRA treatment (10-5\u202fM) significantly impaired the viability of goat DPCs and lowered the ratio of proliferating cells. Otherwise, goat DPCs were stimulated to enter apoptosis and their cell cycle progression was severely blocked by ATRA. Moreover, the expression of fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7), one of the potent hair growth stimulators secreted by DPCs, was transcriptionally repressed following ATRA treatment.DPCs are the targets of ATRA in the hair follicle, and ATRA negatively regulates hair growth by the targeted suppression of cell viability and growth factor expression of goat DPCs. Through these observations, we offer a new mechanistic insight into the roles of ATRA in hair biology.How to cite: Ma S, Zhou G, Chen Y.

Another type of PTM was also observed, i.e., Hydroxylation and Sulfation, with the domains Asparagine_hydroxylase and Collagen_prolyl_lysyl_hydroxylase and Sulfotransferase, respectively. The deamidation type of PTM was present only in Rhizobium sp. NGR234.How to cite: Qureshi MA, Pervez MT, Babar ME, et al.

     "abstract": "Jatropha curcas L., as an important strategic biofuel resource with considerable economic potential, has attracted worldwide attention. However, J. curcas has yet to be domesticated. Plant height, an important agronomic trait of J. curcas, has not been sufficiently improved, and the genetic regulation of this trait in J. curcas is not fully understood. Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), a class of transcription factors, have previously been shown to play critical roles in regulating multiple aspects of plant growth and development and may accordingly be implicated in the genetic regulation of plant height in J. curcas.In this study, we cloned JcZFP8, a C2H2 ZFP gene in J. curcas. We found that the JcZFP8 protein was localized in the nucleus and contained a conserved QALGGH motif in its C2H2 structure. Furthermore, ectopic expression of JcZFP8 under the control of the 35S promoter in transgenic tobacco resulted in dwarf plants with malformed leaves. However, when JcZFP8 was knocked out, the transgenic tobacco did not show the dwarf phenotype. After treatment with the gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC), the dwarf phenotype was more severe than plants that did not receive the PAC treatment, whereas application of exogenous gibberellin3 (GA3) reduced the dwarf phenotype in transgenic plants.The results of this study indicate that JcZFP8 may play a role in J. curcas plant phenotype through GA-related pathways. Our findings may help us to understand the genetic regulation of plant development in J. curcas and to accelerate breeding progress through engineering of the GA metabolic pathway in this plant.How to cite: Shi X, Wu Y, Dai T, et al.

     "abstract": "Although the functional redundancy of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C12O) genes has been reported in several microorganisms, limited enzymes were characterised, let alone the advantage of the coexistence of the multiple copies of C12O genes.In this study, four novel C12O genes, designated catA, catAI, catAII and catAIII, in the naphthalene-degrading strain Pseudomonas putida ND6, were cloned and characterised. Phylogenetic analysis of their deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the four C12O isozymes each formed independent subtrees, together with homologues from other organisms. All four enzymes exhibited maximum activity at pH\u202f7.4 and higher activity in alkaline than in acidic conditions. Furthermore, CatA, CatAI and CatAIII were maximally active at a temperature of 45\u00b0C, whereas a higher optimum temperature was observed for CatAII at a temperature of 50\u00b0C. CatAI exhibited superior temperature stability compared with the other three C12O isozymes, and kinetic analysis indicated similar enzyme activities for CatA, CatAI and CatAII, whereas that of CatAIII was lower. Significantly, among metal ions tested, only Cu2\u00a0+ substantially inhibited the activity of these C12O isozymes, thus indicating that they have potential to facilitate bioremediation in environments polluted with aromatics in the presence of metals. Moreover, gene expression analysis at the mRNA level and determination of enzyme activity clearly indicated that the redundancy of the catA genes has increased the levels of C12O.The results clearly imply that the redundancy of catA genes increases the available amount of C12O in P. putida ND6, which would be beneficial for survival in challenging environments.How to cite: Li S, Qin K, Li H, et al.

Mice were given a subcutaneous injection of B16-F10 cells, and the resultant primary tumors were removed.

In all cases, isolated cells grew at a constant rate, but fluorescence decreased over time and became undetectable on day 14. Cells were tested using PCR for the presence of an EGFP-specific sequence, and results were negative in all cases, thus indicating that the cells did not harbor the host's reporter gene. Cells were also tested for the presence of EGFP mRNA, which was consistently detected for 22\u202fdays after the start of culture. The tumorogenicity of the cultured cells was confirmed in GFP mice injected with cells from a selection of cultures.In a melanoma model in GFP mice, the detection of \u201cgreen\u201d cells in tumors was not equivalent to the detection of host-derived cells.

Currently, anti-fouling treatments that help control this phenomenon involve the use of biocides or antifouling paints that contain heavy metals, which over a long period of exposure can spread to the environment. The bacterium Alteromonas sp. Ni1-LEM has an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of Nitzschia ovalis, an abundant diatom found on submerged surfaces.We evaluated the effect of the bioactive compound secreted by this bacterium on the EPS of biofilms and associated epiphytic bacteria. Three methods of EPS extraction were evaluated to determine the most appropriate and efficient methodology based on the presence of soluble EPS and the total protein and carbohydrate concentrations. Microalgae were cultured with the bacterial compound to evaluate its effect on EPS secretion and variations in its protein and carbohydrate concentrations. An effect of the bacterial supernatant on EPS was observed by assessing biofilm formation and changes in the concentration of proteins and carbohydrates present in the biofilm.These results indicate that a possible mechanism for regulating biofouling could be through alteration of biofilm EPS and alteration of the epiphytic bacterial community associated with the microalga.How to cite: Infante, C.D., Castillo, F., P\u00e9rez, V., et al.

Biotechnological production is an attractive alternative for obtaining this stilbene. In Escherichia coli, malonyl-CoA is the precursor for both stilbene and fatty acid syntheses. In this study, with the aim of increasing pinosylvin production, we evaluated a novel approach that is based on reducing the expression of the gene fabI, which encodes the enzyme enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase that is involved in fatty acid synthesis.A recombineering method was employed to eliminate the chromosomal -35 promoter sequence and the upstream region of the gene fabI in E. coli strain W3110. Analysis, employing RT-qPCR, showed that such modification caused a 60% reduction in the fabI transcript level in the mutant strain W3110\u0394-35fabI::Cm compared to the wild type W3110. Synthetic genes encoding a mutant version of 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3 with improved catalytic activity employing cinnamic acid as substrate and a stilbene synthase from Vitis vinifera were cloned to generate the plasmid pTrc-Sc4CL(M)-VvSTS. The production performance of strains W3110\u0394-35fabI::Cm/pTrc-Sc4CL(M)-VvSTS and W3110/pTrc-Sc4CL(M)-VvSTS was determined in shake flask cultures with Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 10\u00a0g/L glycerol and 3\u00a0mM cinnamic acid. Under these conditions, the strain W3110\u0394-35fabI::Cm/pTrc-Sc4CL(M)-VvSTS produced 52.67\u00a0mg/L pinosylvin, a level 1.5-fold higher than that observed with W3110/pTrc-Sc4CL(M)-VvSTS.A reduction in the transcript level of fabI caused by the elimination of the -35 and upstream promoter sequences is a successful strategy to improve pinosylvin production in E. coli.How to cite: Salas-Navarrete, C., Hern\u00e1ndez-Ch\u00e1vez, G., Flores, N., et al.

P64k was expressed as an intracellular soluble protein about 28% of the total cellular protein. Several scale-up criteria of fermentation processes were studied to obtain the recombinant P64k protein at the pilot production scale.The best operational conditions at a larger scale production of P64k recombinant protein were studied and compared using the four following criteria: Constant Reynold's number (Re constant), Constant impeller tip speed (n di constant), Constant power consumption per unit liquid volume (P/V constant) and Constant volumetric oxygen transfer coefficients (KLa/k constant). The highest production of the recombinant protein was achieved based on the constant KLa/k scale-up fermentation criterion, calculating the aeration rate (Q) and the impeller agitation speed (n) by iterative process, keeping constant the KLa/k value from bench scale. The P64k protein total production at the 50\u00a0l culture scale was 546\u00a0mg\u00a0l-1 in comparison with the 284\u00a0mg\u00a0l-1 obtained at 1.5\u00a0l bench scale.The methodology described herein, for the KLa/k scale-up fermentation criterion, allowed us to obtain the P64k protein at 50\u00a0l scale.

     "abstract": "Trimethylamine (TMA) is the main responsible for the odor associated with rotting fish and other annoying odors generated in many industrial activities. Biofiltration has proved to be efficient for treating odorous gaseous emissions. The main objective of this work was to determine the removal capacity of TMA of a biotrickling filter inoculated with Aminobacter aminovorans and to evaluate the effect of H2S on its performance.The maximum specific growth rate of A. aminovorans in a liquid culture was 0.15\u202fh-1, with a TMA to biomass yield of 0.10 (g\u202fg-1) and a specific consumption rate of 0.062\u202fg\u00b7g-1\u00b7h-1. The initial specific consumption rate of TMA was highly influenced by the presence of H2S in liquid culture at concentrations of 20 and 69\u202fppm in heading space of the flasks. A BTF inoculated with A. aminovorans showed removal efficiencies higher than 98% in a range of loading rate of 0.2 to 8\u202fg\u00b7m-3\u00b7h-1 at empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 85 and 180\u202fs. No effect on the elimination capacity and efficiency was detected when H2S was added at 20 and 50\u202fppm to the inlet gaseous emission, though the fraction of A. aminovorans measured by qPCR in the biofilm decreased.A biotrickling filter inoculated with A. aminovorans can remove efficiently the TMA in a gaseous stream. The elimination capacity of TMA can be negatively affected by H2S, but its effect is not notorious when it is forming part of a biofilm, due to its high specific consumption rate of TMA.How to cite: Aguirre A, Bernal P, Maureira D, et al.

In the past years, marine bacteria have received increasing attention because they represent a fascinating reservoir of genetic and functional diversity that can be utilized to fuel the bioeconomy sector. However, there is an urgent need for an in-depth investigation and improvement of the genetic manipulation tools applicable to marine strains because of the paucity of knowledge regarding this. This review aims to describe the genetic manipulation methods hitherto used in marine bacteria, thus highlighting the limiting factors of the different techniques available today to increase manipulation efficiency. In particular, we focus on methods of natural and artificial transformations (especially electroporation) and conjugation because they have been successfully applied to several marine strains. Finally, we emphasize that, to avoid failure, future work should be carried out to establish tailored methodologies for marine bacteria.How to cite: Zeaiter Z, Mapelli F, Crotti E, et al.

     "abstract": "The use of nonrenewable energy sources to provide the worldwide energy needs has caused different problems such as global warming, water pollution, and smog production. In this sense, lignocellulosic biomass has been postulated as a renewable energy source able to produce energy carriers that can cover this energy demand. Biogas and syngas are two energy vectors that have been suggested to generate heat and power through their use in cogeneration systems. Therefore, the aim of this review is to develop a comparison between these energy vectors considering their main features based on literature reports. In addition, a techno-economic and energy assessment of the heat and power generation using these vectors as energy sources is performed. If lignocellulosic biomass is used as raw material, biogas is more commonly used for cogeneration purposes than syngas. However, syngas from biomass gasification has a great potential to be employed as a chemical platform in the production of value-added products. Moreover, the investment costs to generate heat and power from lignocellulosic materials using the anaerobic digestion technology are higher than those using the gasification technology. As a conclusion, it was evidenced that upgraded biogas has a higher potential to produce heat and power than syngas. Nevertheless, the implementation of both energy vectors into the energy market is important to cover the increasing worldwide energy demand.How to cite: Solarte-Toro JC, Chac\u00f3n-P\u00e9rez Y, Cardona-Alzate CA.

Some lines of evidence have shown that this region could be involved in TRF2 interaction with nuclear lamina.In this study, the fragment of the TERF2 gene encoding udTRF2 domain of telomere-binding protein TRF2 was produced by PCR and cloned into the pET32a vector. The resulting plasmid pET32a-udTRF2 was used for the expression of the recombinant udTRF2 in E. coli RosettaBlue (DE3). The protein was isolated and purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion-exchange chromatography. The purified recombinant protein udTRF2 was injected into guinea pigs to generate polyclonal antibodies. The ability of anti-udTRF2 antibodies to bind endogenous TRF2 in human skin fibroblasts was tested by western blotting and immunofluorescent staining.In this study, the recombinant protein udTRF2 and antibodies to it were generated.

Because of the signally self-assembling abilities and surface activities, hydrophobins were considered as candidates in many aspects, for example, stabilizing foams and emulsions in food products. Lentinus tuber-regium, known as tiger milk mushroom, is both an edible and medicinal sclerotium-producing mushroom. Up to now, the hydrophobins of L. tuber-regium have not been identified.In this paper, a Class I hydrophobin gene, Ltr.hyd, was cloned from L. tuber-regium and expressed in the yeast-like cells of Tremella fuciformis mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The expression vector pGEH-GH was under the control of T. fuciformis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gpd) promoter. The integration of Ltr.hyd into the genome of T. fuciformis was confirmed by PCR, Southern blot, fluorescence observation and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) demonstrated that recombinant hydrophobin rLtr.HYD with an expected molecular mass of 13\u00a0kDa was extracted. The yield of rLtr.HYD was 0.66\u00a0mg/g dry weight. The emulsifying activity of rLtr.HYD was better than the typical food emulsifiers sodium caseinate and Tween 20.We evaluated the emulsifying property of hydrophobin Ltr.HYD, which can be potentially used as a food emulsifier.",

     "abstract": "Poor reproductive efficiency of river buffalos hampers the production capabilities of animals. Buffalos are mainly considered poor breeders owing to the constrained expression of estrus behavior. Failure to display heat signs is an indication of improper functionality of signaling peptides to trigger on a series of behavioral changes, which can be detectable by breeders for timely insemination of females. This might cause an animal to be a repeat breeder. Genomic variations underlying synthesis of signaling peptides can be a useful marker to select superior animals with better reproductive efficiency. In this context, the current study was designed to analyze the CYP19A1 gene in Nili-Ravi buffalo.A total of 97 animals were selected and were divided into two groups on the basis of their heat score. PCR amplification and sequencing of the amplicons were performed using the specific sets of primer, and then, sequences were analyzed for novel variants. A total of 11 polymorphic sites were identified illustrating phenotypic variation in the heat score. Most of the loci were found homologous. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed for association with silent estrus. A three-dimensional protein model was also generated to locate the position of exonic SNPs.This study illustrated that polymorphic sites in the CYP19A1 gene provided potential markers for selection of buffalos with better estrus behavior.",

Among carbapenem analogues a particularly interesting option is provided by combinations of clavulanic acid with meropenem, which have proven to be especially effective.Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) along with the method based on flow cytometry constitutes an important tool in the identification of bacterial sensitivity to active substances. Within this study the inhibitory effect of doripenem, clavulanic acid and the doripenem-clavulanate acid system was analyzed in relation to such bacteria as Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium pasteurianum, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter aerogenes. The lowest MIC, amounting to 0.03\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, was observed for the doripenem-clavulanate acid system in the case of E. coli ATCC 25922. In turn, the lowest MIC for doripenem applied alone was recorded for K. pneumoniae ATCC 31488, for which it was 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The strain which proved to be most resistant both to doripenem and the doripenem-clavulanate acid system, was A. baumannii, with MIC of 32\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (clinical isolate) and 16\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (reference strain). Cytometric analysis for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and S. aureus ATCC 25923 showed changes in cells following exposure to limiting concentrations of the active substance.Analysis of MIC supplies important information concerning microbial sensitivity to active substances, mainly in terms of limiting concentrations causing mortality or vitality of the tested species, which is essential when selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy.",

The differences and similarities, biochemical properties and functional diversity among these eight \u03b1-amylases remain unknown.The eight genes were cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 by shaking-flask fermentation under the induction of methanol. The sequence alignment, biochemical characterizations and product analysis of starch hydrolysis by these \u03b1-amylases were investigated. It is found that the eight \u03b1-amylases belonged to three different groups with the typical structure of fungal \u03b1-amylase. They exhibited maximal activities at 30\u201340\u00b0C except AmyG and were all stable at acidic pH. Ca2\u00a0+ and EDTA had no effects on the activities of \u03b1-amylases except AmyF and AmyH, indicating that the six amylases were Ca2\u00a0+ independent. Two novel \u03b1-amylases of AmyE and AmyF were found. AmyE hydrolyzed starch into maltose, maltotriose and a small amount of glucose, while AmyF hydrolyzed starch into mainly glucose. The excellent physical and chemical properties including high acidic stability, Ca2\u00a0+-independent and high maltotriose-forming capacity make AmyE suitable in food and sugar syrup industries.This study illustrates that a gene family can encode multiple enzymes members having remarkable differences in biochemical properties.

Therefore, we hypothesized that it might be a potential agent used to block allograft rejections. However, most studies of the immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with HA were undertaken at the cellular level. In order to augment these studies, we evaluated the immunosuppressive effects of HA in vivo using an HA transgenic mouse model.Our results revealed similar findings to those reported by in vitro studies, specifically that HA induced prostaglandin E2 expression, downregulated IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 expression, and promoted IL-10 secretion via E-type prostanoid receptor 4. Additionally, we observed that HA overexpression inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced TLR4 activation. These findings provide insight into a new potential agent capable of blocking graft rejection.Our founding suggested that HA-related treatment could be a promising option to improve the viability of grafts in human.",

Lettuce is also crucial for functional genomics research in the Asteraceae which includes species of great agronomical importance. The development of transgenic events implies the production of a large number of shoots that must be differentiated between transgenic and non-transgenic through the activity of the selective agent, being kanamycin the most popular.In this work we adjusted the selection conditions of transgenic seedlings to avoid any escapes, finding that threshold concentration of kanamycin was 75\u00a0mg/L. To monitor the selection system, we studied the morphological response of transgenic and non-transgenic seedlings in presence of kanamycin to look for a visual morphological marker. Several traits like shoot length, primary root length, number of leaves, fresh weight, and appearance of the aerial part and development of lateral roots were affected in non-transgenic seedlings after 30\u00a0d of culture in selective media. However, only lateral root development showed an early, qualitative and reliable association with nptII presence, as corroborated by PCR detection. Applied in successive transgenic progenies, this method of selection combined with morphological follow-up allowed selecting the homozygous presence of nptII gene in 100% of the analyzed plants from T2 to T5.This protocol allows a simplified scaling-up of the production of multiple homozygous transgenic progeny lines in the early generations avoiding expensive and time-consuming molecular assays.",

The purified CPD enzyme, with conserved catalytic triad (Ser155-Asp251-His281) and motif Gly-Asp-Ser-Ala-Gly, was significantly inhibited by PMSF, a serine modifier. Molecular docking between CPD and chlorpyrifos showed that Ser155 was adjacent to chlorpyrifos, which indicated that Ser155 may be the active amino acid involved in chlorpyrifos degradation. This speculation was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of Ser155Ala accounting for the decreased activity of CPD towards chlorpyrifos. According to the key role of Ser155 in chlorpyrifos degradation and molecular docking conformation, the nucleophilic catalytic mechanism for chlorpyrifos degradation by CPD was proposed.The novel enzyme CPD was capable of hydrolyze chlorpyrifos and Ser155 played key role during degradation of chlorpyrifos.",

The addition of alkaline pretreatment led to a higher yield from the enzymatic hydrolysis, with the average glucose concentration 3.5 times that obtained after biomass hydrolysis with an acid pretreatment exclusively. The use of an alkaline pretreatment alone resulted in glucose and xylose concentrations similar to those obtained in the two-step pretreatment: acid pretreatment followed by alkaline pretreatment. There was no significant difference in 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural, or acetic acid concentrations among the pretreatments.Alkaline pretreatment was essential for obtaining high concentrations of glucose and xylose. The application of an alkaline pretreatment alone resulted in high glucose and xylose concentrations. This result is very significant as it allows a cost reduction by eliminating one step.",

Fungi are considered the most efficient producers of these enzymes. Bioprospecting survey to identify fungal sources of biomass-hydrolyzing enzymes from a high-diversity environment is an important approach to discover interesting strains for bioprocess uses. In this study, we evaluated the production of endoglucanase (CMCase) and \u03b2-glucosidase, enzymes from the lignocellulolytic complex, produced by a native fungus. Penicillium sp. LMI01 was isolated from decaying plant material in the Amazon region, and its performance was compared with that of the standard isolate Trichoderma reesei QM9414 under submerged fermentation conditions.The effectiveness of LMI01 was similar to that of QM9414 in volumetric enzyme activity (U/mL); however, the specific enzyme activity (U/mg) of the former was higher, corresponding to 24.170\u00a0U/mg of CMCase and 1.345\u00a0U/mg of \u03b2-glucosidase. The enzymes produced by LMI01 had the following physicochemical properties: CMCase activity was optimal at pH\u00a04.2 and the \u03b2-glucosidase activity was optimal at pH\u00a06.0. Both CMCase and \u03b2-glucosidase had an optimum temperature at 60\u00b0C and were thermostable between 50 and 60\u00b0C. The electrophoretic profile of the proteins secreted by LMI01 indicated that this isolate produced at least two enzymes with CMCase activity, with approximate molecular masses of 50 and 35\u00a0kDa, and \u03b2-glucosidases with molecular masses between 70 and 100\u00a0kDa.The effectiveness and characteristics of these enzymes indicate that LMI01 can be an alternative for the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials and should be tested in commercial formulations.",

PGRPs have been characterized in several fish species. The PGN-binding ability is important for the function of PGRPs. However, the PGRP-PGN interaction mechanism in fish remains unclear. In the present study, the 3-D model of a long PGRP of half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) (csPGRP-L), a marine teleost with great economic value, was constructed through the comparative modeling method, and the key amino acids involved in the interaction with Lys-type PGNs and Dap-type PGNs were analyzed by molecular dynamics and molecular docking methods.csPGRP-L possessed a typical PGRP structure, consisting of five \u03b2-sheets and four \u03b1-helices. Molecular docking showed that the van der Waals forces had a slightly larger contribution than Coulombic interaction in the csPGRP-L-PGN complex. Moreover, the binding energies of csPGRP-L-PGNs computed by MM-PBSA method revealed that csPGRP-L might selectively bind both types of MTP-PGNs and MPP-PGNs. In addition, the binding energy of each residue of csPGRP-L was also calculated, revealing that the residues involved in the interaction with Lys-type PGNs were different from that with Dap-type PGNs.The 3-D structure of csPGRP-L possessed typical PGRP structure and might selectively bind both types of MTP- and MPP-PGNs, which provided useful insights to understanding the functions of fish PGRPs.",

The main goal of this research was to generate new polymorphic insertion\u2013deletion (InDel) markers to aid yellow lupin genetics and breeding. By combining genomic reduction libraries and next generation sequencing, several polymorphic InDel markers were developed for L. luteus L.A total of 118 InDel in silico polymorphic markers were identified. Eighteen InDel primer sets were evaluated in a diverse L. luteus core collection, where amplified between 2\u20133 alleles per locus. Observed heterozygosity (HO; 0.0648 to 0.5564) and polymorphic information content (PIC; 0.06 to 0.48) estimations revealed a moderate level of genetic variation across L. luteus accessions. In addition, ten and nine InDel loci amplified successfully Lupinus hispanicus Boiss & Reut, and Lupinus mutabilis Sweet, respectively, two L. luteus close relatives. PCA analysis identified two L. luteus clusters, most likely explained by the domestication species history.The development of InDel markers will facilitate the study of genetic diversity across L. luteus populations, as well as among closely related species.",

However, they are not extensively used due to different factors such as vulnerability under environmental conditions and the lack of efficient administration methods. A potential solution is the encapsulation of bacteriophages in hydrogel polymers to increase their viability and as a controlled release method. This work describes the use of alginate-Ca+\u00a02 matrixes as mechanisms for protection and dosification of the phage f3\u03b1SE which has been successfully used to prevent infections produced by Salmonella Enteritidis.The viability of the pure phage is reduced in near 100% after 1-h incubation at pH\u00a02 or 3. However, the encapsulated phage remains active in 80, 6% at pH\u00a03, while no differences were observed at pH\u00a02, 4 or 7. Exposition of f3\u03b1SE to different T\u00b0 showed that the viability of this phage decreased with increased T\u00b0 to near 15% at 60\u00b0C, while the encapsulated phage remains with 50% viability at same temperature. Finally, the encapsulation of phages showed to extend their presence for 100\u00a0h in the medium compared to non-encapsulated phages in a water flow system, which simulate automatic birdbath used in poultry industry, maintaining the phage concentration between 102 and 104\u00a0PFU/mL during 250\u00a0h.Encapsulation in alginate-Ca+\u00a02 spheres can be a good alternative to extend viability of phages and can be used as a phage method dosification method in water flow systems.",

Previously improved RAPD and ISSR markers were utilized for genetic analysis using DNA amplification. The genetic relationship dendrogram was obtained by conducting cluster analysis to the similarity coefficient of improved RAPD and ISSR markers. Improved RAPD yielded 185 scorable amplified products, of which 68.6% of the bands were polymorphic, with an average amplification of 9.25 bands per primer. The ISSR markers revealed 156 alleles with 7.8 bands per primers, where 59.7% bands were polymorphic. Furthermore, the similarity coefficient ranges of RAPD and ISSR markers were 0.71\u20130.91 and 0.66\u20130.89, respectively.This study indicated that improved RAPD and ISSR methods are useful tools for evaluating the genetic diversity and characterizing P. chinense.

The influence of operational conditions (agitation rate and inoculum volume) on gum production and rheological properties of gums from the Xanthomonas strains were investigated.The isolated strain of Xanthomonas showed similar xanthan yield compared to the standard strain. Furthermore, this study clearly confirmed that gum yield depended on bacterial strain, agitation rate, and inoculum size. The most suitable conditions for the gum production in an orbital shaker in terms of agitation rate and inoculum size were 180 rpm and 5%, respectively, resulting in an average production of 10.96 and 11.19 g/L for X. axonopodis pv.vesicatoria and X. campestris DSM 19000, respectively.

Consistency of the novel gum solution remarkably was much higher than the commercial xanthan gum solution. Flow and oscillatory behavior and their temperature ramps showed that weak gel-like structure could be obtained with less gum concentrations when the novel gum was used.Therefore, yield and technological properties of the aqueous solutions of the exopolysaccharide synthesized by X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria were observed to be more suitable for industrial production.",

     "abstract": "Availability of related rice species is critical for rice breeding and improvement. Two distinct species of domesticated rice exist in the genus Oryza: Oryza sativa (Asian rice) and Oryza glaberrima (African rice). New rice for Africa (NERICA) is derived from interspecific crosses between these two species. Molecular profiling of these germplasms is important for both genetics and breeding studies. We used 30 polymorphic SSR markers to assess the genetic diversity and molecular fingerprints of 53 rice genotypes of O. sativa, O. glaberrima, and NERICA.In total, 180 alleles were detected. Average polymorphism information content and Shannon's information index were 0.638 and 1.390, respectively. Population structure and neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree revealed that 53 genotypes grouped into three distinct subpopulations conforming to the original three groups, except three varieties (IR66417, WAB450-4, MZCD74), and that NERICA showed a smaller genetic distance from O. sativa genotypes (0.774) than from O. glaberrima genotypes (0.889). A molecular fingerprint map of the 53 accessions was constructed with a novel encoding method based on the SSR polymorphic alleles. Ten specific SSR markers displayed different allelic profiles between the O. glaberrima and O. sativa genotypes.Genetic diversity studies revealed that 50 rice types were clustered into different subpopulations whereas three genotypes were admixtures. Molecular fingerprinting and 10 specific markers were obtained to identify the 53 rice genotypes. These results can facilitate the potential utilization of sibling species in rice breeding and molecular classification of O. sativa and O. glaberrima germplasms.",

The proportion of DHA in S. limacinum F6 was 11.22% higher than that of parent strain S. limacinum B4D1. Finally, the performances of S. limacinum B4D1, E8 and F6 were compared. These three strains had different fatty acid profiles, but there was no statistical difference in their biomasses and lipid yields.It was feasible to identified the relative DHA content of S. limacinum mutants based on their butanol tolerance.",

Strain improvement via molecular approach was proposed on hydrogen and ethanol co-producing bacterium, Escherichia coli SS1. Thus, the effect of additional copy of native hydrogenase gene hybC on hydrogen and ethanol co-production by E. coli SS1 was investigated.Both E. coli SS1 and the recombinant hybC were subjected to fermentation using 10\u00a0g/L of glycerol at initial pH\u00a07.5. Recombinant hybC had about 2-fold higher cell growth, 5.2-fold higher glycerol consumption rate and 3-fold higher ethanol productivity in comparison to wild-type SS1. Nevertheless, wild-type SS1 reported hydrogen yield of 0.57\u00a0mol/mol glycerol and ethanol yield of 0.88\u00a0mol/mol glycerol, which were 4- and 1.4-fold higher in comparison to recombinant hybC. Glucose fermentation was also conducted for comparison study. The performance of wild-type SS1 and recombinant hybC showed relatively similar results during glucose fermentation. Additional copy of hybC gene could manipulate the glycerol metabolic pathway of E. coli SS1 under slightly alkaline condition.HybC could improve glycerol consumption rate and ethanol productivity of E. coli despite lower hydrogen and ethanol yields. Higher glycerol consumption rate of recombinant hybC could be an advantage for bioconversion of glycerol into biofuels. This study could serve as a useful guidance for dissecting the role of hydrogenase in glycerol metabolism and future development of effective strain for biofuels production.",

The protease produced by Actinomadura keratinilytica strain T16-1 was previously reported to have PDLLA depolymerase activity. However, few studies have reported on PDLLA-degrading enzyme production by bacteria. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine a suitable immobilization material for PDLLA-degrading enzyme production and optimize PDLLA-degrading enzyme production by using immobilized A. keratinilytica strain T16-1 under various fermentation process conditions in a stirrer fermenter.Among the tested immobilization materials, a scrub pad was the best immobilizer, giving an enzyme activity of 30.03\u00a0U/mL in a shake-flask scale. The maximum enzyme activity was obtained at aeration 0.25\u00a0vvm, agitation 170\u00a0rpm, 45\u00b0C, and 48\u00a0h of cultivation time. Under these conditions, a PDLLA-degrading enzyme production of 766.33\u00a0U/mL with 15.97\u00a0U/mL\u00b7h productivity was observed using batch fermentation in a 5-L stirrer fermenter. Increased enzyme activity and productivity were observed in repeated-batch (942.67\u00a0U/mL and 19.64\u00a0U/mL\u00b7h) and continuous fermentation (796.43\u00a0U/mL and 16.58\u00a0U/mL\u00b7h) at a dilution rate of 0.013/h. Scaled-up production of the enzyme in a 10-L stirrer bioreactor using the optimized conditions showed a maximum enzyme activity of 578.67\u00a0U/mL and a productivity of 12.06\u00a0U/mL\u00b7h.This research successfully scaled-up the enzyme production to 5 and 10\u00a0L in a stirrer fermenter and is helpful for many applications of poly(lactic acid).",

In this study, the effects of different morphologic forms, cultivation time and temperature, presence or absence of oxygen, carbon sources, and concentration of nitrogen source on the products of M. indicus were investigated.The fungus with all morphologies produced high yields of ethanol, in the range of 0.32\u20130.43\u00a0g/g, on glucose. However, the fungus with filamentous morphology produced higher amounts of oil, protein, phosphate, and glucosamine together with ethanol, compared with other morphologies. A higher amount of oil (0.145\u00a0g/g biomass) was produced at 28\u00b0C, while the best temperature for protein and glucosamine production was 32 and 37\u00b0C, respectively. Although ethanol was produced at a higher yield (0.44\u00a0g/g) under anaerobic conditions compared with aerobic conditions (yield of 0.41\u00a0g/g), aerobic cultivation resulted in higher yields of protein (0.51\u00a0g/g biomass), glucosamine (0.16\u00a0g/g alkali insoluble material, AIM), and phosphate (0.11\u00a0g/g AIM).It is not possible to have the maximum amounts of the products simultaneously. The fermentation conditions and composition of culture media determine the product yields. Carbon source type and the addition of nitrogen source are among the most influencing factors on the product yields. Moreover, all measured products were made with higher yields in cultivation on glucose, except glucosamine, which was produced with higher yields on xylose.",

However, there are few vectors available for cloning and expressing extremely toxic genes, which limits further basic and applied research on extremely toxic proteins.In this study, a novel vector pAU10 was constructed in E. coli. pAU10 utilizes the combination of the efficient but highly repressible T7-lacO promoter/operator and the strong rrnBT2 transcriptional terminator upstream of the T7 promoter to strictly control unwanted transcription of the extremely toxic gene; in addition, the trp promoter/operator is oriented opposite to the T7 promoter to control the production of the antisense RNA that may block the translation of leaky mRNA. Without the supplementation of IPTG and L-tryptophan in the culture medium, transcription of the extremely toxic gene by the T7 promoter is highly repressed, and the trp promoter produces the antisense RNA, which strictly prevents unwanted expression of the extremely toxic protein in E. coli. With the supplementation of IPTG and L-tryptophan, the T7 promoter efficiently transcribes the extremely toxic gene, and the trp promoter does not produce the antisense RNA, ensuring efficient expression of the extremely toxic protein in E. coli. Tight regulation and efficiency of expression of an extremely toxic gene cloned in the vector pAU10 were confirmed by cloning and expressing the restriction endonuclease-encoding gene bamHI without its corresponding methylase gene in E. coli JM109(DE3).pAU10 is a good vector used for cloning and expressing extremely toxic genes in E. coli.",

Use of renewable sources for the production of fuels and energy is an important alternative with biodiesel remains as one of the promising options. Aim of this work is to evaluate the fungus Fusarium oxysporum for its potentials to accumulate microbial lipids when grown on synthetic media and saccharified sweet sorghum stalks.The effect of different carbon sources, nitrogen sources and C/N ratio on the lipid production was initially examined, which resulted in a lipid concentration of 4.4\u00a0g/L, with lipid content of 42.6% w/w. Sweet sorghum stalks were able to support growth and lipid production of the fungus, both as carbon source and as nitrogen source. It was also shown that saccharification of the dried stalks is an important step to increase lipid production. Removal of the remaining stalk solids enabled the lipid production during cultivation in increased initial solids of up to 16 w/w. This resulted in a lipid production of 3.81\u00a0g/L.It was demonstrated that F. oxysporum can be used as an efficient oleaginous microorganism, with sweet sorghum serving as an excellent raw material for the cultivation of the fungus. The lipids obtained during this work were also found to have a fatty acid profile with good potentials to be used for biodiesel production.",

In that objective, we report an in vivo \u03b2-glucosidase assay as a fast method to find a \u03b2-glucosidase producer strain.The method consists in growing the strains for testing in a medium supplemented with the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-glucopyranoside (pNPG). The presence of \u03b2-glucosidases converts the substrate to p-nitrophenol (pNP), a molecule that can be easily measured in the supernatant spectrophotometrically at 405\u00a0nm. The assay was evaluated using two Bifidobacterium strains: Bifidobacterium longum B7254 strain that lacks \u03b2-glucosidase activity and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum B7003 strain that shows \u03b2-glucosidase activity. The addition of sodium carbonate during pNP measurement increases the sensitivity of pNP detection and avoids the masking of absorbance by the culture medium. Furthermore, we show that pNP is a stable enzymatic product, not metabolized by bacteria, but with an inhibitory effect on cell growth. The \u03b2-glucosidase activity was measured as units of enzyme per gram per minute per dry cell weight. This method also allowed the identification of Lactobacillus strains with higher \u03b2-glucosidase activity among several lactobacillus species.This in vivo \u03b2-glucosidase assay can be used as an enzymatic test on living cells without cell disruption.

Small RNA based repertoire includes both small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) molecules. In the Prunus genus, sharka disease, caused by the Plum pox virus (PPV), first occurred on European plum (Prunus domestica) and then spread over among all species in this genus and thus classified as quarantine pathogen. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used for the study of siRNA/miRNA molecules; however, NGS relies on adequate extraction protocols. Currently, knowledge of PPV-Prunus interactions in terms of siRNA populations and miRNA species is still scarce, and siRNA/miRNA extraction protocols are limited to species such as peach, almond, and sweet cherry.We describe a reliable procedure for siRNA/miRNA purification from Prunus salicina trees, in which previously used protocols did not allow adequate purification. The procedure was based on a combination of commercially available RNA purification kits and specific steps that yielded high quality purifications. The resulting molecules were adequate for library construction and NGS, leading to the development of a pipeline for analysis of both siRNAs and miRNAs in the PPV\u2013P. salicina interactions. Results showed that PPV infection led to altered siRNA profiles in Japanese plum as characterized by decreased 24-nt and increased 21- and 22-nt siRNAs. Infections showed miR164 and miR160 generation and increased miR166, miR171, miR168, miR319, miR157, and miR159.We propose this protocol as a reliable and reproducible small RNA isolation procedure for P. salicina and other Prunus species.",

     "abstract": "During salt stress, the yeast Debaryomyces hansenii synthesizes tyrosine as a strategy to avoid the oxidation of proteins. Tyrosine reacts with nitrogen radicals to form 3-nitrotyrosine. 3-nitrotyrosine prevents the effects of associated oxidative stress and thus contributes to the high halotolerace of the yeast. However, the mechanism of how D. hansenii counteracts the presence of this toxic compound is unclear. In this work, we evaluated D. hansenii's capacity to assimilate 3-nitrotyrosine as a unique nitrogen source and measured its denitrase activity under salt stress. To identify putative genes related to the assimilation of 3-nitrotyrosine, we performed an in silico search in the promoter regions of D. hansenii genome.We identified 15 genes whose promoters had binding site sequences for transcriptional factors of sodium, nitrogen, and oxidative stress with oxidoreductase and monooxygenase GO annotations. Two of these genes, DEHA2E24178g and DEHA2C00286g, coding for putative denitrases and having GATA sequences, were evaluated by RT-PCR and showed high expression under salt and nitrogen stress.D. hansenii can grow in the presence of 3-nitrotyrosine as the only nitrogen source and has a high specific denitrase activity to degrade 3-nitrotyrosine in 1 and 2\u00a0M NaCl stress conditions. The results suggest that given the lack of information on transcriptional factors in D. hansenii, the genes identified in our in silico analysis may help explain 3-nitrotyrosine assimilation mechanisms.",

Amino acid content analysis showed that the essential amino acid content and amino acid composition of the fermentation product significantly improved when engineered A. oryzae strains were used for soybean meal fermentation.These findings suggest that cloning of microbial protease genes with good physicochemical properties and expressing them in an ideal host such as A. oryzae is a novel strategy to enhance the value of soybean meal.",

     "abstract": "Idesia polycarpa Maxim. var. vestita Diels, a dioecious plant, is widely used for biodiesel due to the high oil content of its fruits. However, it is hard to distinguish its sex in the seedling stage, which makes breeding and production problematic as only the female tree can produce fruits, and the mechanisms underlying sex determination and differentiation remain unknown due to the lack of available genomic and transcriptomic information. To begin addressing this issue, we performed the transcriptome analysis of its female and male flower.28,668,977 and 22,227,992 clean reads were obtained from the female and male cDNA libraries, respectively. After quality checks and de novo assembly, a total of 84,213 unigenes with an average length of 1179\u00a0bp were generated and 65,972 unigenes (78.34%) could be matched in at least one of the NR, NT, Swiss-Prot, COG, KEGG and GO databases. Functional annotation of the unigenes uncovered diverse biological functions and processes, including reproduction and developmental process, which may play roles in sex determination and differentiation. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed many unigenes annotated as metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathways, plant\u2013pathogen interaction, and plant hormone signal transduction. Moreover, 29,953 simple sequence repeats were identified using the microsatellite software.This work provides the first detailed transcriptome analysis of female and male flower of I. polycarpa and lays foundations for future studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying flower bud development of I. polycarpa.",

These enzymes play a central role in wound healing, and they have potential to be used therapeutically.Rapid amplification of cDNA ends and rapid amplification of genomic ends were used to identify the coding sequence of MMP-1 from L. sericata. Different segments of MMP1 gene, namely the middle part, 3\u2032 end, and 5\u2032 end, were cloned, sequenced, and analyzed using bioinformatics tools to determine the distinct features of MMP-1 protein.Assembling the different segments revealed that the complete mRNA sequence of MMP-1 is 1932\u00a0bp long. CDS is 1212\u00a0bp long and is responsible for the production of MMP-1 of 404 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 45.1\u00a0kDa. The middle part, 3\u2032 end, and 5\u2032 end sequences were 933, 503, and 496\u00a0bp. In addition, it was revealed that the MMP-1 genomic sequence includes three exons and two introns. Furthermore, the three-dimensional structure of L. sericata MMP-1 protein was evaluated, and its alignment defined that it has high similarity to chain A of human MMP-2 with 100% confidence, 72% coverage, and 38% identity according to the SWISS-MODEL modeling analysis.MMP-1 of L. sericata has a close relationship with its homologs in invertebrates and other insects.

Because of its rarity in non-endemic coastal areas, determining the nature and origin of a chronic, enlarged liver cystic mass is challenging in these regions. Under these circumstances, physicians need a confirmatory diagnostic tool beyond immunological and radiological examinations. This study investigated a novel human single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody for the confirmative diagnosis of 18 atypical hydatid disease cases in non-endemic coastal areas.A scFv antibody against cystic echinococcosis was produced by genetic engineering and then applied to the immunohistochemical diagnosis of 18 cases of cystic echinococcosis presented in non-endemic coastal areas. The diagnosis of these cases by ultrasound and serum-based examinations was inconclusive. The 750\u00a0bp scFv antibody gene was expressed in COS-7 cells, and the antibody localized in the cytoplasm. The scFv antibody can detect the germinal layer and protoscolices of actively growing cysts but not of the degenerating protoscolices and has a diagnostic efficiency higher than that of single serum or ultrasound testing (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The combined use of scFv antibodies with serology and ultrasound diagnostics results in a diagnostic efficiency comparable to that of surgery. The scFv antibody can be used as a confirmatory test for the diagnosis of hydatid disease in non-endemic areas, providing a beneficial supplementary diagnostic method that complements traditional immune testing and ultrasonic radiology and thus helping physicians to effectively differentiate hydatid disease.",

This study investigated the effect of mRNA stability on pullulanase heterologous expression.We constructed four DNA fragments, pulA, SD-pulA, pulA-3t, and SD-pulA-3t, which were cloned into the expression vector pHT43 to generate four pullulanase expression plasmids. The DNA fragment pulA was the coding sequence (CDS) of pulA in Klebsiella variicola Z-13. SD-pulA was constructed by the addition of the 5\u2032 SD sequence at the 5\u2032 UTR of pulA. pulA-3t was constructed by the addition of a 3\u2032 stem-loop structure at the 3\u2032 UTR of pulA.

We produced and analyzed massive sequence information from pooled samples of P. orientalis through transcriptome sequencing, which generated 51,664 unigenes with an average length of 475\u00a0bp. We then used RNA-seq analysis to obtain a high-resolution age\u2013course profile of gene expression in 20- and 3,000-year-old P. orientalis individuals. Totally, 106 differentially expressed genes were obtained, of which 47 genes were downregulated and 59 upregulated in the old tree. These genes were involved in transcription factors, hormone-related responses, ROS scavengers, senescence-related responses, stress response, and defense and possibly play crucial roles in tackling various stresses in the 3,000-year-old P. orientalis during its life time. The expression patterns of genes related to ROS homeostasis further indicated that the high ability of ROS scavenging could be helpful for the 3,000-year-old P. orientalis to resist senescence.This study provides a foundation for the elucidation of senescence resistance through molecular studies and the discovery of useful genes in P. orientalis.",

Recent research has tried to evaluate and compare the nanotoxicity of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) produced by two types of microorganisms in vitro by two different methods. AuNPs were produced by Bacillus cereus and Fusarium oxysporum, and their production was confirmed by visible spectral, transmission electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The human fibroblast cell line CIRC-HLF was treated with AuNPs, and the induced nanotoxicity was measured using direct microscopic and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays.The results showed that the produced AuNPs had a maximum absorbance peak around 510\u2013530\u00a0nanometer (nm), with spherical, hexagonal, and octagonal shapes and average sizes around 20\u201350\u00a0nm. The XRD results confirmed the presence of GNPs in the microbial culture supernatants. An MTT assay showed that GNPs had dose-dependent toxic effects, and microscopic analysis showed that GNPs induced cell abnormalities in doses lower than the determined half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s).In conclusion, the biologically produced AuNPs had toxic effects in the cell culture, and direct techniques such as microscopic evaluation instead of indirect methods such as MTT assay were more useful for assessing the nanotoxicity of the biologically produced AuNPs. Thus, the use of only MTT assay for nanotoxicity evaluation of AuNPs is not desirable.",

The analysis revealed that the polysaccharide extract from sea cucumber processing liquor (PESCPL) is predominantly composed of mannose, in addition to some glucose and fucose. The antioxidant activity of PESCPL was analyzed using in vitro. It was demonstrated that PESCPL could effectively scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide anion radicals. The effect of PESCPL was investigated in vivo by using mice model fed with high-fat diets with/without PESCPL supplement. It was shown that PESCPL could increase the catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in the serum and decrease serum malonaldehyde content. Furthermore, mice fed with PESCPL diet showed a considerable decrease in the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.Our research highlights that PESCPL is a natural antioxidant and could be utilized as a therapeutic supplement for dyslipidemia.",

The D500G variant retained similar catalytic characteristics to the wild-type laccase, and could efficiently decolorize synthetic dyes at alkaline conditions. Various cultivation factors such as medium components, pH and temperature were investigated for their effects on laccase expression. After cultivation optimization, a laccase activity of 347\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0U/L was finally achieved for D500G after 3\u00a0d of induction, which was about 9.3 times higher than that of wild-type enzyme. The protein yield under the optimized conditions was about 59\u00a0mg/L for D500G.The productivity of the thermo-alkali stable laccase from B. licheniformis expressed in P. pastoris was significantly improved through the combination of site-directed mutagenesis and optimization of the cultivation process. The mutant enzyme retains good stability under high temperature and alkaline conditions, and is a good candidate for industrial application in dye decolorization.",

Only three of the twelve participant laboratories presented problems in sensitivity and one in specificity. Problems in specificity (false positives) were most likely caused by cross contamination of the samples, while errors in sensitivity (false negatives) were due to detection problems of the least concentrated viral sample. Regarding repeatability, many of the laboratories presented great dispersion of the results (Ct values) for replicate samples over the three days of the trial. Moreover, large differences in the Ct values for each sample were detected among all the laboratories.Overall, the ring trial showed high values of sensitivity and specificity, with some problems of repeatability and inter-laboratory variability.

There is a constant search for efficient alginate-producing organisms.In this study, a novel strain of Pseudomonas mandelii isolated from Antarctica was characterized and found to overproduce alginate compared with other good alginate producers such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Alginate production and expression levels of the alginate operon were highest at 4\u00b0C. It is probable that this alginate-overproducing phenotype was the result of downregulated MucA, an anti-sigma factor of AlgU.Because biofilm formation is an efficient bacterial strategy to overcome stressful conditions, alginate overproduction might represent the best solution for the successful adaptation of P. mandelii to the extreme temperatures of the Antarctic.

VLY is a pore-forming toxin that is suggested to be the main virulence factor of G. vaginalis. The high recurrence rate of BV and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial species demonstrate the need for the development of recombinant antibodies as novel therapeutic agents for disease treatment. Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) generated against VLY exhibited reduced efficacy to neutralize VLY activity compared to the respective full-length antibodies. To improve the properties of scFvs, monospecific dimeric scFvs were generated by the genetic fusion of two anti-VLY scFv molecules connected by an alpha-helix-forming peptide linker.N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged dimeric scFvs were constructed and produced in Escherichia coli and purified using metal chelate affinity chromatography. Inhibition of VLY-mediated human erythrocyte lysis by dimeric and monomeric scFvs was detected by in vitro hemolytic assay. The circulating half-life of purified scFvs in the blood plasma of mice was determined by ELISA. Dimeric anti-VLY scFvs showed higher neutralizing potency and extended circulating half-life than parental monomeric scFv.The protein obtained by the genetic fusion of two anti-VLY scFvs into a dimeric molecule exhibited improved properties in comparison with monomeric scFv. This new recombinant antibody might implement new possibilities for the prophylaxis and treatment of the diseases caused by the bacteria G. vaginalis.",

     "abstract": "Cinnamomum longepaniculatum is an important commercial crop and the main source of volatile terpenoids. The biosynthesis of key bioactive metabolites of C. longepaniculatum is not well understood because of the lack of available genomic and transcriptomic information. To address this issue, we performed transcriptome sequencing of C. longepaniculatum leaves to identify factors involved in terpenoid metabolite biosynthesis.Transcriptome sequencing of C. longepaniculatum leaves generated over 56 million raw reads. The transcriptome was assembled using the Trinity software and yielded 82,061 unigenes with an average length of 879.43\u00a0bp and N50 value of 1387\u00a0bp. Furthermore, Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs analysis indicated that our assembly is 91% complete. The unigenes were used to query the nonredundant database depending on sequence similarity; 42,809 unigenes were homologous to known genes in different species, with an annotation rate of 42.87%. The transcript abundance and Gene Ontology analyses revealed that numerous unigenes were associated with metabolism, while others were annotated in functional categories including transcription, signal transduction, and secondary metabolism. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that 19,260 unigenes were involved in 385 metabolic pathways, with 233 unigenes found to be involved in terpenoid metabolism. Moreover, 23,463 simple sequence repeats were identified using the microsatellite identification tool.This is the first detailed transcriptome analysis of C. longepaniculatum. The findings provide insights into the molecular basis of terpenoid biosynthesis and a reference for future studies on the genetics and breeding of C. longepaniculatum.",

It is crucial to have a suitable set of reference genes to normalize target gene expression in peanut under different conditions using RT-qPCR. In this study, 11 candidate reference genes were selected and examined under abiotic stresses (drought, salt, heavy metal, and low temperature) and hormone (SA and ABA) conditions as well as across different organ types. Three statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) were used to evaluate the expression stabilities of reference genes, and the comprehensive rankings of gene stability were generated.The results indicated that ELF1B and YLS8 were the most stable reference genes under PEG-simulated drought treatment. For high-salt treatment using NaCl, YLS8 and GAPDH were the most stable genes. Under CdCl2 treatment, UBI1 and YLS8 were suitable as stable reference genes. UBI1, ADH3, and ACTIN11 were sufficient for gene expression normalization in low-temperature experiment. All the 11 candidate reference genes showed relatively high stability under hormone treatments. For organs subset, UBI1, GAPDH, and ELF1B showed the maximum stability. UBI1 and ADH3 were the top two genes that could be used reliably in all the stress conditions assessed. Furthermore, the necessity of the reference genes screened was further confirmed by the expression pattern of AnnAhs.The results perfect the selection of stable reference genes for future gene expression studies in peanut and provide a list of reference genes that may be used in the future.",

Despite their resistant structure, keratin wastes can be efficiently degraded by various microorganisms through the secretion of keratinases, which are promising enzymes for several applications, including detergents, fertilizers, and leather and textile industry. In an attempt to isolate keratinolytic microorganisms that can reach commercial exploitation as keratinase producers, the current work assesses the dynamics of keratin biodegradation by several keratinolytic fungal strains isolated from soil. The activity of fungal strains to degrade keratin substrates was evaluated by SEM, FTRIR-ATR spectra and TGA analysis.SEM observations offered relevant information on interactions between microorganism and structural elements of hair strands. FTIR spectra of the bands at 1035\u20131075\u00a0cm-1 assigned to sulfoxide bond appeared because of S\u2013S bond breaking, which demonstrated the initiation of keratin biodegradation. According to TGA, in the second zone of thermal denaturation, where keratin degradation occurs, the highest weight loss of 71.10% was obtained for sample incubated with Fusarium sp. 1A.Among the tested strains, Fusarium sp. 1A was the most active organism in the degradation process with the strongest denaturation of polypeptide chains. Because keratinolytic microorganisms and their enzymes keratinases represent a subject of scientific and economic interest because of their capability to hydrolyze keratin, Fusarium sp. 1A was selected for further studies.",

This paper gives an overview of the biotechnological aspects of PA production and introduces Propionibacterium as the most popular organism for PA production. Moreover, all process variables influencing the production yield, different simple and complex carbon sources, the metabolic pathway of production, engineered mutants with increased productivity, and modified tolerance against high concentrations of acid have been described. Furthermore, possible methods of extraction and analysis of this organic acid, several applied bioreactors, and different culture systems and substrates are introduced. It can be concluded that maximum biomass and PA production may be achieved using metabolically engineered microorganisms and analyzing the most significant factors influencing yield. To date, the maximum reported yield for PA production is 0.973\u00a0g\u00b7g-1, obtained from Propionibacterium acidipropionici in a three-electrode amperometric culture system in medium containing 0.4\u00a0mM cobalt sepulchrate. In addition, the best promising substrate for PA bioproduction may be achieved using glycerol as a carbon source in an extractive continuous fermentation. Simultaneous production of PA and vitamin B12 is suggested, and finally, the limitations of and strategies for competitive microbial production with respect to chemical process from an economical point of view are proposed and presented. Finally, some future trends for bioproduction of PA are suggested.",

Thus, 26 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 140 individual samples from 12 diploid sugar beet pollinators (pollen parents) and two cytoplasmic male sterile (cms) lines (seed parents). Eight pollinators originated from three research centers in the United States Department of Agriculture, while four pollinators and cms lines were from the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, Novi Sad, Serbia.In total, 129 alleles were obtained, with a mean of 3.2 alleles per SSR marker. The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.00 to 0.87 (mean\u00a0=\u00a00.30). Expected heterozygosity and Shannon's information index were the lowest for marker BQ590934 and the highest for markers SB15s and FDSB502s; the same markers were the most informative, with PIC values of 0.70 and 0.69, respectively. Three private alleles were found in pollinator EL0204; two in pollinator C51; and one in pollinators NS1, FC221, and C93035. Molecular variance showed that 77.34% of the total genetic variation was attributed to intrapopulation variability. Cluster and correspondence analysis grouped sugar beet pollinators according to the breeding centers, with few exceptions, which indicate that certain amount of germplasm was shared, although centers had their own breeding programs.The results indicate that this approach can improve the selection of pollinators as suitable parental components and could further be applied in sugar beet breeding programs.",

However, studies are lacking on the latex component that is considered rich in proteins with potentially important physiological functions and secondary metabolites that are a promising source for new drugs. The proteomic analysis, which would be the first step to study these substances, was hampered by the presence of interfering components. Phenol extraction and Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone extraction, two major plant proteomic isolation methods, were used and compared in this study.We identified 459 proteins from the J. curcas latex proteome using the combination of the two extraction techniques. Although more number of latex proteins were identified by the phenol extraction (401 proteins vs. 123 proteins by the TCA/acetone extraction), only 65 proteins were commonly isolated by both methods. Analysis of the biochemical properties revealed that relatively more number of lower isoelectric point (pI) proteins were isolated by the TCA/acetone method (pI mode: 4.79, 6.51 for phenol). Moreover, GO, COG, and KEGG analyses showed that certain classes/categories/pathways annotated more number of proteins than others, and most of them had proportionally comparable protein counts by both the methods, however, with exemplified exceptions.A large number of proteins were found and exclusively identified by either method, indicating that a better proteome coverage of plant samples in a similar context needs the combined use of multiple isolation methods. In addition, the core biological function of the latex may be uncovered by certain GO, COG, and KEGG classes/categories/pathways that annotate more proteins.",

The optimum fermentation condition was achieved at a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 12.4, with a decrease in surface tension of up to 27\u00a0mN/m.For further development and industrial applications, the modified Gompertz equation is proposed to predict the cell mass and biosurfactant production as a goodness of fit was obtained with this model. The modified Gompertz equation was also extended to enable the excellent prediction of the surface tension.",

     "abstract": "To reduce costs associated with productivity of recombinant proteins in the biopharmaceutical industry, research has been focused on regulatory principals of growth and survival during the production phases of the cell culture. The main strategies involve the regulation of cell proliferation by the modulation of cell cycle control points (G1/S or G2/M) with mild hypothermia and the addition of sodium butyrate (NaBu). In this study, batch culture strategies were evaluated using CHO TF 70R cells producing the recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rh-tPA), to observe their individual and combined effect on the cellular physiological state and relevant kinetic parameters.NaBu addition has a negative effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u2206\u00a0\u03a8m), the values of which are remarkably diminished in cultures exposed to this cytotoxic compound. This effect was not reflected in a loss of cell viability. NaBu and mild hypothermic conditions increased the doubling time in the cell cultures, suggesting that these strategies triggered a general slowing of each cell cycle phase in a different way. Finally, the individual and combined effect of NaBu and mild hypothermia produced an increase in the specific rh-tPA productivity in comparison to the control at 37\u00b0C without NaBu. Nevertheless, both strategies did not have a synergistic effect on the specific productivity.The combination of NaBu addition and mild hypothermic condition causes an impact on physiological and metabolic state of CHO TF 70R cells, decreasing cell growth rate and improving glucose consumption efficiency. These results therefore provide a promising strategy to increase specific productivity of rh-tPA.",

The present study evaluated the defense response of patchouli inoculated with virulent R. solanacearum.Results showed that the basic enzymatic activities differed not only between the leaves and stems but also between the upper and lower parts of the same organ of patchouli. POD, SOD, PPO, and PAL enzymatic activities were significantly elevated in leaves and stems from patchouli inoculated with R. solanacearum compared to those in control. The variation magnitude and rate of POD, PPO, and PAL activities were more obvious than those of SOD in patchouli inoculated with R. solanacearum. PAGE isoenzymatic analysis showed that there were one new POD band and two new SOD bands elicited, and at least two isoformic POD bands and two SOD bands were observably intensified compared to the corresponding control.Our results suggest that not only defense-related enzymatic activities were elevated but also the new isoenzymatic isoforms were induced in patchouli inoculated with R. solanacearum.",

To improve extracellular enzyme production for potential industrial applications, the endoglucanase gene of Bacillus subtilis M015, isolated from Thai higher termite, was expressed in a periplasmic-leaky Escherichia coli. Then, the crude recombinant endoglucanase (EglS) along with a commercial cellulase (Cel) was used for hydrolyzing celluloses and microbial hydrolysis using whole bacterial cells.E. coli Glu5 expressing endoglucanase at high levels was successfully constructed. It produced EglS (55\u00a0kDa) with extracellular activity of 18.56\u00a0U/mg total protein at optimal hydrolytic conditions (pH\u00a04.8 and 50\u00b0C). EglS was highly stable (over 80% activity retained) at 40\u201350\u00b0C after 100\u00a0h. The addition of EglS significantly improved the initial sugar production rates of Cel on the hydrolysis of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose, and corncob about 5.2-, 1.7-, and 4.0-folds, respectively, compared to those with Cel alone. E. coli Glu5 could secrete EglS with high activity in the presence of glucose (1% w/v) and Tween 80 (5% w/v) with low glucose consumption. Microbial hydrolysis of CMC using E. coli Glu5 yielded 26\u00a0mg reducing sugar/g CMC at pH\u00a07.0 and 37\u00b0C after 48\u00a0h.The recombinant endoglucanase activity improved by 17 times compared with that of the native strain and could greatly enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis of all studied celluloses when combined with a commercial cellulase.",

The immobilized HRP was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray. In addition, it retained 55% of its initial activity after 10 reuses. The optimal pH shifted from 7.0 for soluble HRP to 7.5 for the immobilized HRP, and the optimal temperature shifted from 40\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C.

As the follicle size increased, OAZ1 abundance showed an increasing trend during follicular development, while it decreased during follicular regression. The level of OAZ1 mRNA expression was the lowest in the fifth largest preovulatory follicle, and was 0.65-fold compared to the small white follicle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

This drove attention of scores of researchers to investigate alternative methods for the biodegradation of dyes using fungal strains. In this work, white-rot fungus (Panus tigrinus) was used as a biosorbent for the decolorization of Reactive Blue 19. The process parameters that were varied were initial concentration (50\u2013150\u00a0mg/L), contact time (30\u201390\u00a0min), and pH (2\u20136). In addition, to gain important data for the evaluation of a sorption process, the equilibrium and kinetics of the process were determined.White-rot fungus showed great potential in decolorizing Azo dyes. The strain showed the maximum decolorization of 83.18% at pH\u00a02, a contact time of 90\u00a0min, and an initial concentration of 50\u00a0mg/L.

Analysis of the kinetic data showed that the dye uptake process followed the pseudo second-order rate expression.The biosorption process provided vital information on the process parameters required to obtain the optimum level of dye removal. The isotherm study indicated the homogeneous distribution of active sites on the biomass surface, and the kinetic study suggested that chemisorption is the rate-limiting step that controlled the biosorption process.

A locally isolated glycerol-consuming Escherichia coli SS1 was found to produce lower hydrogen levels under optimized ethanol production conditions. Molecular approach was proposed to improve the hydrogen yield of E. coli SS1 while maintaining the ethanol yield, particularly in acidic conditions. Therefore, the effect of an additional copy of the native hydrogenase gene hycE and recombinant clostridial hydrogenase gene hydA on hydrogen production by E. coli SS1 at low pH was investigated.Recombinant E. coli with an additional copy of hycE or clostridial hydA was used for fermentation using 10\u00a0g/L (108.7\u00a0mmol/L) of glycerol with an initial pH of 5.8. The recombinant E. coli with hycE and recombinant E. coli with hydA showed 41% and 20% higher hydrogen yield than wild-type SS1 (0.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mol/mol glycerol), respectively. The ethanol yield of recombinant E. coli with hycE (0.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0mol/mol glycerol) was approximately 30% lower than that of wild-type SS1, whereas the ethanol yield of recombinant E. coli with hydA (0.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0mol/mol glycerol) was comparable to that of wild-type SS1.Insertion of either hycE or hydA can improve the hydrogen yield with an initial pH of 5.8. The recombinant E. coli with hydA could retain ethanol yield despite high hydrogen production, suggesting that clostridial hydA has an advantage over the hycE gene in hydrogen and ethanol coproduction under acidic conditions.

The 11 populations included in the study were distributed across a large geographic range in China. The kernel oil content differed significantly among populations. The SSR marker analysis detected high genetic diversity among the populations. All SSRs were polymorphic, and we identified 80 alleles across the populations.

Continuous feeding gave better results with the highest PE and QE of 112.9\u00a0g/L and 2.35\u00a0g/L\u00b7h, respectively, at a feeding time of 9\u00a0h and feeding rate of 40\u00a0g\u00a0sugar/h.In the batch fermentation, nitrogen supplementation resulted in 4 to 32\u00a0g/L increases in ethanol production, depending on the initial sugar level in the SSJ. Under the VHG condition, with sufficient nitrogen, the fed-batch fermentation with continuous feeding resulted in a similar PE and increased QP by 51% compared to those in the batch fermentation.",

The objective of this study was to compare the capacity of strains representing three diverse heterofermentative species belonging to the genus Lactobacillus to synthesize and/or transform 1,2-PD as well as to suggest new directions of research aimed at commercial use of this metabolite.The novel strain of Lactobacillus buchneri A KKP 2047p, characterized as exhibiting an unusual trait for that species in the form of capacity to metabolize 1,2-PD, grew poorly in a medium containing 1,2-PD as a sole carbon source. The supplementation with glucose facilitated rapid growth of bacteria and use of 1,2-PD for the synthesis of propionic acid. A similar observation was noted for Lactobacillus reuteri. On the other hand, Lactobacillus diolivorans effectively metabolized 1,2-PD which was the sole carbon source in the medium, and the addition of glucose inhibited the synthesis of propionic acid. The experiments also investigated the effect of cobalamin as a diol dehydratase coenzyme involved in the propionic acid synthesis from 1,2-PD whose addition promoted the yield of the reaction in the case of all tested strains.All tested isolates showed the ability to effectively metabolize 1,2-PD (in the presence of cobalamin) and its conversion to propionic acid, which reveals that investigated bacteria meet the essential requirements of microorganisms with a potential application.",

     "abstract": "Presently, the society is facing a serious challenge for the effective management of the increasing amount of produced municipal solid wastes. The accumulated waste has caused a series of environmental problems such as uncontrolled release of greenhouse gases. Moreover, the increasing amount of wastes has resulted in a shortage of areas available for waste disposal, resulting in a nonsustainable waste management. These problems led to serious public concerns, which in turn resulted in political actions aiming to reduce the amount of wastes reaching the environment. These actions aim to promote sustainable waste management solutions. The main objective of these policies is to promote the recycling of municipal solid waste and the conversion of waste to energy and valuable chemicals. These conversions can be performed using either biological (e.g., anaerobic digestion) or thermochemical processes (e.g., pyrolysis). Research efforts during the last years have been fruitful, and many publications demonstrated the effective conversation of municipal solid waste to energy and chemicals. These processes are discussed in the current review article together with the change of the waste policy that was implemented in the EU during the last years.",

     "abstract": "Ascorbic acid (Asc) is one of the most abundant antioxidants and it serves as a major contributor to protect plants against oxidative damage. Plants use two enzymes that participate in the metabolic recycling of Asc. One of these two enzymes is dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR). It directly regenerates Asc from its oxidized state and thus prevents Asc from being irreversibly hydrolyzed to 2, 3-diketogulonic acid. This study aimed to examine whether over-expression of DHAR leads to an enhanced oxidative stress tolerance in tobacco plants.In this study, we functionally characterized a novel JcDHAR gene from Jatropha curcas and found via quantitative RT-PCR analysis that JcDHAR can be induced with H2O2, salt and PEG stresses. The DHAR activities of transgenic tobacco plants increased from 2.0 to 5.3 fold compared to wild-type plants. As a result, the transgenic plants displayed enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress.Our results indicate that JcDHAR expression can effectively enhance the tolerance to oxidative stress in plants.",

     "abstract": "Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is a major oilseed crop worldwide. Fatty acid composition of peanut oil may affect the flavor and shelf life of the resulting food products. Oleic acid and linoleic acid are the major fatty acids of peanut oil. The conversion from oleic acid to linoleic acid is controlled by the \u039412 fatty acid desaturase (FAD) encoded by AhFAD2A and AhFAD2B, two homoeologous genes from A and B subgenomes, respectively. One nucleotide substitution (G:C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0A:T) of AhFAD2A and an \u201cA\u201d insertion of AhFAD2B resulted in high-oleic acid phenotype. Detection of AhFAD2 mutation had been achieved by cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS), real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). However, a low cost, high throughput and high specific method is still required to detect AhFAD2 genotype of large number of seeds. Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) can detect both alleles in a single reaction. The aim of this work is to develop KASP for detection AhFAD2 genotype of large number of breeding materials.Here, we developed a KASP method to detect the genotypes of progenies between high oleic acid peanut and common peanut. Validation was carried out by CAPS analysis. The results from KASP assay and CAPS analysis were consistent. The genotype of 18 out of 179 BC4F2 seeds was aabb.Due to high accuracy, time saving, high throughput feature and low cost, KASP is more suitable for determining AhFAD2 genotype than other methods.",

     "abstract": "A simple and efficient strategy for agarase immobilization was developed with carboxyl-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (CMNPs) as support. The CMNPs and immobilized agarase (agarase-CMNPs) were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, vibrating sample magnetometry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and zeta-potential analysis. The hydrolyzed products were separated and detected by ESI-TOF-MS.The agarase-CMNPs exhibited a regular spherical shape with a mean diameter of 12\u00a0nm, whereas their average size in the aqueous solution was 43.7\u00a0nm as measured by dynamic light scattering. These results indicated that agarase-CMNPs had water swelling properties. Saturation magnetizations were 44 and 29\u00a0emu/g for the carriers and agarase-CMNPs, respectively. Thus, the particles had superparamagnetic characteristics, and agarase was successfully immobilized onto the supports. Agaro-oligosaccharides were prepared with agar as substrate using agarase-CMNPs as biocatalyst. The catalytic activity of agarase-CMNPs was unchanged after six reuses. The ESI-TOF mass spectrogram showed that the major products hydrolyzed by agarase-CMNPs after six recycle uses were neoagarotetraose, neoagarohexaose, and neoagarooctaose. Meanwhile, the end-products after 90\u00a0min of enzymatic treatment by agarase-CMNPs were neoagarobiose and neoagarotetraose.The enhanced agarase properties upon immobilization suggested that CMNPs can be effective carriers for agarase immobilization. Agarase-CMNPs can be remarkably used in developing systems for repeated batch production of agar-derived oligosaccharides.",

A strain GM-1, Microbacterium sp. GM-1, isolated from active sludge, was investigated for its ability to produce urease and induce calcium carbonate precipitation in a metabolic process.It was discovered that Microbacterium sp. GM-1 resisted high concentrations of urea up to 60\u00a0g/L. In order to optimize the calcification process of Microbacterium sp. GM-1, the concentrations of Ni2\u00a0+ and urea, pH value, and culture time were analyzed through orthogonal tests. The favored calcite precipitation culture conditions were as follows: the concentration of Ni2\u00a0+ and urea were 50\u00a0\u03bcM and 60\u00a0g/L, respectively, pH of 10, and culture time of 96\u00a0h. Using X-ray diffraction analysis, the calcium carbonate polymorphs produced by Microbacterium sp. GM-1 were proven to be mainly calcite.The results of this research provide evidence that Microbacterium sp.

Stilbenes are bioactive compounds present in G. parvifolium plants, and they possess antioxidative and anticancer properties. However, little is known about the responses of G. parvifolium stilbene biosynthetic pathways to stress conditions. Therefore, we investigated stilbene biosynthesis, including the expression of relevant genes, in G. parvifolium exposed to high-temperature and ultraviolet-C treatments.High temperatures did not influence the accumulation of total stilbenes in stems but decreased stilbene concentrations in roots at 3\u00a0h, with a subsequent restoration to control levels. In contrast, ultraviolet irradiation induced the accumulation of total stilbenes in stems but not in roots. We also observed that high temperatures inhibited the production of resveratrol and piceatannol in G. parvifolium stems and roots, whereas ultraviolet treatments initially inhibited their accumulation (up to 6\u00a0h) but induced their production at later time points. Analyses of specific genes (i.e., PAL, C4H, 4CL, STS, and CYP) revealed that their expression levels generally increased in stress-treated stems and roots, although there was some variability in the expression profiles during treatments.Our results indicated that high temperatures and ultraviolet irradiation differentially affect the biosynthesis of specific stilbenes in G. parvifolium stems and roots. Therefore, cultivating G. parvifolium seedlings under optimal stress conditions may increase the biosynthesis of specific stilbene compounds.",

BYQ-12 was a motile, rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium with an optimum growth at 30\u00b0C and pH\u00a02.5. 16S rDNA phylogeny showed that BYQ-12 was a new strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans.

In April 2012, two full-sib families were separately used as donor and host oysters for a nucleus insertion operation. The pearl sac was sampled from the host oysters at day 60 after nucleus operation. A large number of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed using Illumina HiSeq\u2122 2000 platform. The two full-sib families were also used to mine diagnostic SSR markers for genotyping donor oyster, host oyster, and pearl sac.A total of 3168 microsatellite loci were identified in 39,078 unigenes, and 1977 SSR primers were designed by Primer 3.0. Forty-seven SSR primers were validated, and the rate of successful amplification was 72.3%. Two diagnostic SSR primers could successfully genotype pearl sac, donor oyster, and host oyster.

In this study, the influences of eight metal ions (i.e., Mn2\u00a0+, Na+, Mg2\u00a0+, Zn2\u00a0+, Cu2\u00a0+, Fe2\u00a0+, Fe3\u00a0+ and Al3\u00a0+) on botrallin and TMC-264 production in liquid culture of the endophytic fungus Hyalodendriella sp. Ponipodef12 were investigated.Three most effective metal ions (Zn2\u00a0+, Cu2\u00a0+ and Mg2\u00a0+) along with their optimum concentrations were screened. The optimum addition time and concentrations of Zn2\u00a0+, Cu2\u00a0+ and Mg2\u00a0+ were further obtained respectively for improving botrallin and TMC-264 production. The combination effects of Zn2\u00a0+, Cu2\u00a0+ and Mg2\u00a0+ on the production of botrallin and TMC-264 by employing statistical method based on the central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were evaluated, and two quadratic predictive models were developed for botrallin and TMC-264 production. The yields of botrallin and TMC-264, which were predicted as 144.12\u00a0mg/L and 36.04\u00a0mg/L respectively, were validated to be 146.51\u00a0mg/L and 36.63\u00a0mg/L accordingly with the optimum concentrations of Zn2\u00a0+ at 0.81\u00a0mmol/L, Cu2\u00a0+ at 0.20\u00a0mmol/L, and Mg2\u00a0+ at 0.13\u00a0mmol/L in medium.The results indicated that the enhancement of botrallin and TMC-264 accumulation in liquid culture of the endophytic fungus Hyalodendriella sp.

For this last process, some microbial inhibitors, as furfural, constitute severe bottleneck. In this case, the use of strains able to produce xylitol simultaneously to furfural neutralization is an interesting alternative. A wild-type strain of Geotrichum sp. was detected with this ability, and its performance in xylitol production and furfural consumption was evaluated. Furthermore, were analyzed its degradation products.Geotrichum sp. produced xylitol from d-xylose fermentation with a yield of 0.44\u00a0g\u00b7g-1. Furfural was fully consumed in fermentation assay and when provided in the medium until concentration of 6\u00a0g\u00b7L-1. The furfural degradation product is not an identified molecule, presenting a molecular weight of 161\u00a0g\u00b7mol-1, an uncommon feature for the microbial metabolism of this product.This strain presents most remarkable potential in performing furfural consumption simultaneous to xylitol production.

The glycation and conformational alteration of HSA in the presence of the tested compounds were evaluated by Congo red assay, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The antioxidant (AO) capacity were also tested by four different assays including: DPPH (2,2\u2032-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical), ABTS (2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) diammonium salt), FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) and \u03b2-carotene-linoleic acid assay. The tested compounds showed AG and AO effects. The intensity of the accomplished AO potential is related to the type of the used assay. Significant alterations in the secondary (monitored by CD spectropolarimetry) and tertiary structure (assessed by spectrofluorimetry) of HSA upon glycation were mitigated by the 4-ACDs, suggesting their suppressive role in the late stage (post-Amadori) of the HSA glycation.By the analogues, in vitro ascertained AO and AG properties of 4-ACD may be recognized as rationale for their protective role against oxidative changes of proteins, thereby precluding diabetic complications in humans.",

The deduced amino acid sequence contained eight conserved domains of the DEAD-box protein family. The tissue distribution showed that vasa mRNA was specifically expressed in ovary and testis. Histologically, the sperm cells were decreased in number and an acellular zone was seen in the testis. The transcript level of vasa gradually increased with a significant difference between the experimental and control groups. After BPA exposure with 0.50 and 1.00\u00a0mg/L for 1, 3, 6 and 9 d, the expression levels of vasa increased.These findings suggest that BPA can increase the expression level of vasa mRNA and influence the development of the testis in C. japonica.",

     "abstract": "Developing countries have an estimate of ten times more approved biosimilars than developed countries. This disparity demands the need of an objective regulation that incorporates health policies according to the technological and economical capabilities of each country. One of the challenges lies on the establishment of comparability principles based on a physicochemical and biological characterization that should determine the extent of additional non-clinical and clinical studies. This is particularly relevant for licensed biosimilars in developing countries, which have an extensive clinical experience since their approval as generics, in some cases more than a decade. To exemplify the current status of biosimilars in Mexico, a characterization exercise was conducted on licensed filgrastim biosimilars using pharmacopeial and extended characterization methodologies.Most of the evaluated products complied with the pharmacopeial criteria and showed comparability in their Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) towards the reference product. These results were expected in accordance with their equivalent performance during their licensing as generics. Accordingly, a rational approval and registration renewal scheme for biosimilars is proposed, that considers the proper identification of CQAs and its thoroughly evaluation using selected techniques.This approach provides support to diminish uncertainty of exhibiting different pharmacological profiles and narrows or even avoids the necessity of comparative clinical studies. Ultimately, this proposal is intended to improve the accessibility to high quality biosimilars in Latin America and other developing countries.",

Fungal damage usually appears as change in wood color, appearance of stains, and sometimes deformation of wooden surfaces. In this study we focused on the effect that some fungi exert on the properties of wooden artifacts and evaluated the effectiveness of different concentrations of chitosan on their protection against damage by mold fungi.Samples were collected from different monuments and environments, and fungi growing on them were isolated and identified. The isolated Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger strains were used for the infestation of new pitch pine samples. The results revealed that the lightness of samples infected with any of the tested fungi decreased with increasing incubation times. XRD analysis showed that the crystallinity of incubated samples treated individually with the different concentrations of chitosan was lower than the crystallinity of infected samples. The crystallinity index measured by the first and the second method decreased after the first and second months but increased after the third and fourth months. This may due to the reducing of amorphous part by enzymes or acids produced by fungi in wooden samples.The growth of fungi on the treated wood samples decreased with increasing the concentration of chitosan. Hence, it was demonstrated that chitosan prevented fungal growth, and its use could be recommended for the protection of archeological wooden artifacts.",

To date, there has been no report about characterization of KSDD from Mycobacterium neoaurum strains, which were usually employed to produce AD or ADD by fermentation.In this work, Corynebacterium crenatum was chosen as a new host for heterologous expression of KSDD from M. neoaurum JC-12 after codon optimization of the KSDD gene. SDS-PAGE and western blotting results indicated that the recombinant C. crenatum harboring the optimized ksdd (ksddII) gene showed significantly improved ability to express KSDD. The expression level of KSDD was about 1.6-fold increased C. crenatum after codon optimization. After purification of the protein, we first characterized KSDD from M. neoaurum JC-12, and the results showed that the optimum temperature and pH for KSDD activity were 30\u00b0C and pH\u00a07.0, respectively.

At this time, the content of the acetic acid produced reached the level of 7.049\u00a0g/L.Utilization of by-products is a significant challenge for manufacturing sites and the natural environment.

Specific concentrations of sodium acetate or phosphate were added to batch cultures, and the effects on hydrogen production were comparatively analyzed using a modified Gompertz model. Adding 50\u00a0mM acetate or phosphate suppressed the hydrogen production peak and slightly extended the lag phase. However, the overall hydrogen yields were 113.5 and 108.5\u00a0mmol/L, respectively, and the final pH was effectively controlled. Acetate buffered against hydrogen production more effectively than did phosphate, promoting cell growth and preventing decreased pH. At buffer concentrations 100\u2013250\u00a0mM, the maximum hydrogen production was barely suppressed, and the lag phase extended past 7\u00a0h.

The degradation kinetics of MTBE demonstrated that S. maltophilia IPN-TD had a significantly higher overall MTBE degradation efficiency and rate (48.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.18% and 1.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0mg\u00a0L-1\u00a0h-1, respectively) than the IPN-120526 consortium (38.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.17% and 1.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.087\u00a0mg\u00a0L-1\u00a0h-1, respectively). The kinetics of MTBE removal by both cultures fit first-order and pseudo-first-order reaction models.These findings suggest that S. maltophilia IPN-TD in axenic culture has considerable potential for the detoxification of MTBE-contaminated water.",

However, no appropriate methods have been reported for total RNA isolation from P. orientalis leaves. The TRIzol method did not extract RNA, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, sodium dodecyl sulfate-phenol, and plant RNAout kit (Tianz, Inc., China) protocols resulted in low yields of poor quality RNA. Isolating total RNA using the Spectrum\u2122 Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) resulted in a high-quality product but a low yield. However, the two-step removal of polyphenols and polysaccharides in the improved plant RNAout kit protocol resulted in the isolation of RNA with a 28S:18S rRNA ratio of band intensities that was ~\u00a02:1, the A260/A280 absorbance ratio was 2.03, and the total RNA yield from P. orientalis leaves was high. This protocol was tested on different P. orientalis tissues of different ages and on leaves of five other Cupressaceae plants. The total RNAs were successfully used in complementary DNA synthesis for transcriptome sequencing and would be suitable to use in additional experiments. The results of this study will benefit future studies in Cupressaceae plants.",

     "abstract": "Bioethanol production is one pathway for crude oil reduction and environmental compliance. Bioethanol can be used as fuel with significant characteristics like high octane number, low cetane number and high heat of vaporization. Its main drawbacks are the corrosiveness, low flame luminosity, lower vapor pressure, miscibility with water, and toxicity to ecosystems. One crucial problem with bioethanol fuel is the availability of raw materials. The supply of feedstocks for bioethanol production can vary season to season and depends on geographic locations. Lignocellulosic biomass, such as forest-based woody materials, agricultural residues and municipal waste, is prominent feedstock for bioethanol cause of its high availability and low cost, even though the commercial production has still not been established. In addition, the supply and the attentive use of microbes render the bioethanol production process highly peculiar. Many conversion technologies and techniques for biomass-based ethanol production are under development and expected to be demonstrated. In this work a technological analysis of the biochemical method that can be used to produce bioethanol is carried out and a review of current trends and issues is conducted.",

The mtDNA and the Y chromosome, with their unique patterns of inheritance, continue to be extremely important source of information. These markers played significant roles in farm animals in the evaluation of the genetic variation within- and among-breed strains and lines and have widely applied in the fields of linkage mapping, paternity tests, prediction of breeding values in genome-assisted selection, analysis of genetic diversity within breeds detection of population admixture, assessment of inbreeding and relationships between breeds, and assignment of individuals to their breed of origin. This approach offers a unique opportunity to save genetic resources and achieving improved productivity.

More detailed researches are still in progress in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of such extant variability.

However, the use of L. japonica as a feedstuff in Apostichopus japonicas farming is not ideal because A. japonicas does not produce enough enzyme activity for degrading the large amount of algin present in L. japonica. In this study, semi solid fermentation of the L. japonica feedstuff employing a Bacillus strain as the microbe was used to as a mean to degrade the algin content in L. japonica feedstuff.The Bacillus strain, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens WB1, was isolated by virtue of its ability to utilize sodium alginate as the sole carbon source. Eight factors affecting growth and algin-degrading capacity of WB1 were investigated. The results of Plackett\u2013Burman design indicated that fermentation time, beef extract, and solvent to solid ratio were the significant parameters. Furthermore, the mutual interaction between the solvent to solid ratio and beef extract concentration was more significant than the other pairs of parameters on algin degradation. Optimal values obtained from Central-Composite Design were 113.94 h for fermentation time, 0.3% (w/v) beef extract and 44.87 (v/w) ratio of solvent to feedstuff. Under optimal conditions, 56.88% of the algin was degraded when a 50-fold scale-up fermentation was carried out, using a 5-L fermenter.This study provides an alternative and economical way to reduce the algin content in L. japonica through degradation by WB1, making it a promising potential source of feed for cultured L. japonica.",

     "abstract": "Cultivation of algae for conversion to biofuels has gained global interest. Outdoor raceway cultivation is preferred because of its lower capital and operating costs. A major disadvantage of outdoor cultivation is susceptibility of algal crops to attack by predatory rotifers. In order to quantify the impact of rotifer attack on different species of algae, we evaluated the growth of eleven microalgal species over a 21-d period after being infected by the predatory rotifer Brachionus rubens.Of the eleven species, Chlorella sorokiniana was the most susceptible with rapid decline in algal growth concomitant with increase in rotifer population growth (3.82/d). In contrast, Synechococcus elongatus and Scenedesmus dimorphus were both resistant to the rotifer and suppressed rotifer growth (-0.06/d). An index of algal species susceptibility to be consumed by the rotifer was generated with C. sorokiniana as the baseline (index\u00a0=\u00a01.000) indicating most susceptible among species tested. Other species' susceptibilities are indicated in parenthesis as follows: Monoraphidium spp. (0.997), Chlamydomonas globosa (0.827), Botryococcus braunii (0.740), Chlorella minutissima (0.570), Chlamydomonas augustae (0.530), Chlamydomonas yellowstonensis (0.500), Scenedesmus bijuga (0.420), and Haematococcus pluvialis (0.360). Two species, namely, S. dimorphus and S. elongatus were unique in that they exhibited an ability to suppress the growth of the rotifer as indicated by the decline in rotifer populations in their presence.Variations in susceptibility of algal species to rotifer predation could be a result of their individual morphology, cell walls structure, or the biochemical composition of individual species.",

After expression of rhAT by S. cerevisiae, the biomass and rhAT concentration were analyzed through fed-batch fermentation process.In fed-batch fermentation, the biomass (maximum cell dry weight of 11.2\u00a0g/L) and rhAT concentration (312\u00a0mg/L) of the expressed rhAT were achieved at 84\u00a0h of cultivation time. The maximum cell lysis efficiency (99.89%) was found at 8\u00a0s sonication pulse and 7\u00a0mL lysis buffer volume. The rhAT protein solution was concentrated and partially purified using cross-flow filtration with the recovery yield and purity of 95 and 94%, respectively.

The purified rhAT was characterized by various analytical techniques, such as RP-HPLC, FT-IR, CD, SDS-PAGE, western blotting, and Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) analysis. The biological activity of rhAT was analyzed as heparin cofactor to meet the therapeutic grade applications.The simple, cost-effective and economically viable nature of the process used in the present study for the production of rhAT will be highly beneficial for the healthcare sector. This may also be used to produce other value-added therapeutic recombinant proteins expressed in S. cerevisiae, with greater effectiveness and ease.",

P. pastoris transfected with an hTopoI recombinant vector was used for the optimization of a higher level of hTopoI expression.In the process, fed-batch cultivation parameters that influence the expression of hTopoI, such as culture temperature, methanol induction and feeding strategy, were optimised in the transfected KM71H and X33 P. pastoris strains in a shake flask system. The cell density and total protein concentration (protein level) of transfected P. pastoris were compared to determine the optimum culture conditions for each transfected P. pastoris strain. A higher hTopoI level was observed in the transfected KM71H culture supernatant (2.26\u00a0ng/mL) when the culture was incubated in the optimum conditions.This study demonstrated that MutS strain (KM71H) expressed and secreted a higher level of hTopoI heterologous protein in the presence of methanol compared to the Mut+ strain; X33 (0.75\u00a0ng/mL). However, other aspects of optimization, such as pH, should also be considered in the future, to obtain the optimum expression level of hTopoI in P. pastoris.",

Around 71% of genomic SSRs were dinucleotide, 25% tri, 3% tetra and 1% penta nucleotide motives. Twenty-two primers generated a total of 91 alleles with a mean of 4.14 alleles per locus and 100% polymorphism percentage. A 0.595 average polymorphic information content and 0.662 primer discrimination power values were recorded. The expected and observed heterozygosities were 0.676 and 0.763 respectively. Pair-wise similarity values ranged from 0.06 to 0.89 and the overall cultivars averaged 0.41. The UPGMA cluster analysis recovered by principal coordinate analysis illustrated that cultivars tend to group according to their class of maturity, region of cultivation, and fruit color. Analysis of molecular variations (AMOVA) revealed that genetic variation among and within cultivars were 27% and 73%, respectively according to geographical distribution of cultivars.The developed microsatellite markers are additional values to date palm characterization tools that can be used by researchers in population genetics, cultivar identification as well as genetic resource exploration and management. The tested cultivars exhibited a significant amount of genetic diversity and could be suitable for successful breeding program.

A popular way to construct the reduced-representation sequencing libraries is to digest the genomic DNA with restriction enzymes. A key factor of this method is to determine the restriction enzyme(s). But there are few computer programs which can evaluate the usability of restriction enzymes in reduced-representation sequencing. SimRAD is an R package which can simulate the digestion of DNA sequence by restriction enzymes and return enzyme loci number as well as fragment number. But for linkage mapping analysis, enzyme loci distribution is also an important factor to evaluate the enzyme. For phylogenetic studies, comparison of the enzyme performance across multiple genomes is important. It is strongly needed to develop a simulation tool to implement these functions.Here, we introduce a Perl module named RestrictionDigest with more functions and improved performance. It can analyze multiple genomes at one run and generate concise comparison of enzyme performance across the genomes. It can simulate single-enzyme digestion, double-enzyme digestion and size selection process and generate comprehensive information of the simulation including enzyme loci number, fragment number, sequences of the fragments, positions of restriction sites on the genome, the coverage of digested fragments on different genome regions and detailed fragment length distribution.RestrictionDigest is an easy-to-use Perl module with flexible parameter settings. With the help of the information produced by the module, researchers can easily determine the most appropriate enzymes to construct the reduced-representation libraries to meet their experimental requirements.",

The Cry9A proteins show high toxicity against different Lepidoptera, and no-cross resistance with Cry1A.Cry9Aa655 protein formed oligomers easily in solution mediated by disulfide bonds, according to SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing and reducing conditions. However, oligomerization is not observed if Cry9Aa655 is activated with trypsin, suggesting that cysteine residues, C14 and C16, located in the N-terminal end that is processed during activation participate in this oligomerization. To determine the role of these residues on oligomerization and in toxicity single and double alanine substitution were constructed. In contrast to single C14A and C16A mutants, the double C14A\u2013C16A mutant did not form oligomers in solution. Toxicity assays against Plutella xylostella showed that the C14A\u2013C16A mutant had a similar insecticidal activity as the Cry9Aa655 protein indicating the oligomers of Cry9Aa formed in solution in the absence of receptor binding are not related with toxicity.The aggregation of Cry9Aa655 polypeptides was mediated by disulfide bonds.

However, varietal contamination due to natural outcrossing causes significant quality reduction and yield losses. In this study, 48 polymorphic SSR markers were used to assess the diversity among all pigeonpea varieties cultivated in Malawi to determine if a genetic fingerprint could be identified to distinguish the popular varieties.A total of 212 alleles were observed with an average of 5.58 alleles per marker and a maximum of 14 alleles produced by CCttc019 (Marker 40). Polymorphic information content (PIC), ranged from 0.03 to 0.89 with an average of 0.30. A neighbor-joining tree produced 4 clusters. The most commonly cultivated varieties, which include released varieties and cultivated land races, were well-spread across all the clusters observed, indicating that they generally represented the genetic diversity available in Malawi, although substantial variation was evident that can still be exploited through further breeding.Screening of the allelic data associated with the five most popular cultivated varieties, revealed 6 markers \u2013 CCB1, CCB7, Ccac035, CCttc003, Ccac026 and CCttc019 \u2013 which displayed unique allelic profiles for each of the five varieties.

The microorganisms associated with marine macroorganisms offer tremendous potential for exploitation of bioactive metabolites. Biofouling is a continuous problem in marine sectors which needs huge economy for control and cleaning processes. Biotechnological way for searching natural product antifouling compounds gained momentum in recent years because of the environmental pollution associated with the use of toxic chemicals to control biofouling. While, natural product based antifoulants from marine organisms particularly sponges and corals attained significance due to their activities in field assays, collection of larger amount of organisms from the sea is not a viable one. The microorganisms associated with sponges, corals, ascidians, seaweeds and seagrasses showed strong antimicrobial and also antifouling activities. This review highlights the advances in natural product antifoulants research from microbes associated with marine organisms.",

     "abstract": "Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable source of energy that has been widely explored as second-generation biofuel feedstock. Despite more than four decades of research, the process of ethanol production from lignocellulosic (LC) biomass remains economically unfeasible. This is due to the high cost of enzymes, end-product inhibition of enzymes, and the need for cost-intensive inputs associated with a separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process. Thermotolerant yeast strains that can undergo fermentation at temperatures above 40\u00b0C are suitable alternatives for developing the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process to overcome the limitations of SHF. This review describes the various approaches to screen and develop thermotolerant yeasts via genetic and metabolic engineering. The advantages and limitations of SSF at high temperatures are also discussed. A critical insight into the effect of high temperatures on yeast morphology and physiology is also included. This can improve our understanding of the development of thermotolerant yeast amenable to the SSF process to make LC ethanol production commercially viable.",

The factors such as moisture, pH, and peptone were significantly affected enzyme production and these three factors were selected for further optimization using central composite design. The optimum medium for fibrinolytic enzyme production was wheat bran medium containing 1% peptone and 80% moisture with pH\u00a08.32. Under these optimized conditions, the production of fibrinolytic enzyme was found to be 6851\u00a0U/g. The fibrinolytic enzyme was purified by 3.6-fold with 1275\u00a0U/mg specific activity. The molecular mass of fibrinolytic enzyme was determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and it was observed as 29\u00a0kDa. The fibrinolytic enzyme depicted an optimal pH of 9.0 and was stable at a range of pH from 8.0 to 10.0. The optimal temperature was 60\u00b0C and was stable up to 50\u00b0C. This enzyme activated plasminogen and also degraded the fibrin net of blood clot, which suggested its potential as an effective thrombolytic agent.Wheat bran was found to be an effective substrate for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme. The purified fibrinolytic enzyme degraded fibrin clot. The fibrinolytic enzyme could be useful to make as an effective thrombolytic agent.",

We compared and presented results of six most popular and publically available servers for protein structure comparison. These web-based servers were compared with the respect to functionality (features provided by these servers) and accuracy (how well the structural comparison is performed). The CATH was used as a reference. The results showed that overall CE was top performer. DALI and PhyreStorm showed similar results whereas PDBeFold showed the lowest performance. In case of few secondary structural elements, CE, DALI and PhyreStorm gave 100% success rate.Overall none of the structural alignment servers showed 100% success rate.

The expression patterns of two Wnt4 genes in the gonads at different stages of development and in fish after treatment with 17\u03b1-methyltestosterone (MT) were investigated.The tissue distribution showed that Wnt4a was expressed in various tissues, including the gonads, gills, spleen, brain, and fin. Interestingly, Wnt4b not only was expressed in the gills, brain, and spleen, but also was obviously expressed in the ovary. During gonad development, Wnt4a was highly expressed in the testis at stage I and Wnt4b was mainly expressed in the ovary at stages II\u2013III. After MT treatment, the mRNA expression of Wnt4a increased significantly up to 40\u00a0d, and the transcript level of Wnt4b decreased at 20\u00a0d.These results suggest that Wnt4a may be involved in gonad development and plays a role in the process of spermatogonial proliferation.

Seed size is one of the most important traits of seed yield and has been selected since the beginning of agriculture. Increasing the seed size is a main goal of Jatropha domestication for increasing the seed yield, but the genetic regulation of seed size in Jatropha has not been fully understood.We cloned CYP78A98 gene from Jatropha, a homologue of CYP78A5 in Arabidopsis. We found that CYP78A98 was highly expressed in male flower, female flower, stem apex, leaf and developing seed. However, its transcripts were hardly detected in root and stem. CYP78A98 protein localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the hydrophobic domain at the N-terminus was essential for the correct protein localization. Furthermore, INNER NO OUTER promoter (pINO) drove specific overexpression of CYP78A98 in transgenic tobacco seeds resulted in increased seed size and weight, as well as improved seed protein and fatty acid content.The results indicated that CYP78A98 played a role in Jatropha seed size control.

Compared with the level of PRLR mRNA expression in the small white follicles (SWFs), the level of PRLR mRNA was 2.86- and 1.44-fold higher in the F4 and small yellow follicles (SYFs), respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The level of PRLR mRNA expression in the F4 follicles was highest (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in HFs. The highest PRL concentration in all of the examined samples was observed in SYFs and F1, with concentration of 6162\u00a0mLU/g and 6197\u00a0mLU/g, respectively. The PRL concentration in SYFs was significantly higher compared with SWFs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The change of PRL concentration was similar to the PRLR mRNA expression level in preovulatory follicles. These results suggest that the PRL mediated by the PRLR plays a stimulatory role in the SWF to SYF transition.",

AHAS is the first enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway that produces the branched-chain of the essential amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Therefore, multiple copies of the AHAS gene might be of interest for breeding programs targeting herbicide resistance. In this work, the characterization of the AHAS gene was accomplished for the Chenopodium quinoa Regalona-Baer cultivar. Cloning, sequencing, and Southern blotting were conducted to determine the number of gene copies.The presence of multiple copies of the AHAS gene as has been shown previously in several other species is described. Six copies of the AHAS gene were confirmed with Southern blot analyses. CqHAS1 and CqAHAS2 variants showed the highest homology with AHAS mRNA sequences found in the NR Database. A third copy, CqAHAS3, shared similar fragments with both CqAHAS1 and CqAHAS2, suggesting duplication through homeologous chromosomes pairing.The presence of multiple copies of the gene AHAS shows that gene duplication is a common feature in polyploid species during evolution. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first report of the interaction of sub-genomes in quinoa.",

Endophytic fungi promote plant growth, improve the host plant's resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and can produce the same or similar biologically active substances as the host. Thus, endophytic fungal products have important implications in drug development.Among the numerous endophytic fungi, we identified two strains, L10Q37 and LQ2F02, that have anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, but the active compound was not huperzine A. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of secondary metabolites isolated from the endophytic fungi of Huperzia serrata. Microbial cultivation and fermentation were used to obtain secondary metabolites. Active components were then extracted from the secondary metabolites, and their activities were tracked. Two compounds that were isolated from endophytic fungi of H. serrata were identified and had acetylcholine inhibitory activities. In conclusion, endophytic fungal strains were found in H. serrata that had the same anti-acetylcholinesterase activity.We isolated 4 compounds from the endophytic fungus L10Q37, among them S1 and S3 are new compounds. 6 compounds were isolated from LQ2F02, all 6 compounds are new compounds. After tested anti acetylcholinesterase activity, S5 has the best activity. Other compounds' anti acetylcholinesterase activity was not better compared with huperzine A.",

The presence of metal induced high levels of antioxidant enzymes, including lipid peroxidation, thereby revealing the appearance of an oxidative stress response. The variation in polyphosphate levels indicates the participation of the polymer in response to stress induced by copper. The activities of the phosphatases were positively influenced by growing them in the presence of copper. Ultrastructure changes in the cell surface, electron density, thickness, and septation were visualized by exposing cells to increasingly larger concentrations of metal. The isolate was able to remove the agent from the growth medium, while maintaining its physiological functions. The metal removed from the cultures exposed to 0.5\u00a0mM, 1\u00a0mM and 2\u00a0mM copper exhibited percentages of removal equivalent to 75.78%, 66.04% and 33.51%.The results indicate that the isolate was able to grow in high concentrations of copper, activates mechanisms for adaptation and tolerance in the presence of metal, and is highly efficient at removing the agent.

During environmental surveillance that we performed every summer, we occasionally observed a thermolabile hemolysin (tlh) PCR product of a slightly smaller size than expected, which was coincident with low loads of V. parahaemolyticus in the environment. In order to understand this observation, we probed the specificity of tlh primers for the detection of V. parahaemolyticus at different bacterial loads and DNA concentrations.Primers used for the detection of V. parahaemolyticus specific tlh amplified a slightly smaller tlh gene, which is found in Vibrio alginolyticus and other related strains. These amplicons were observed when V. parahaemolyticus was absent or in undetectable loads in the environment.Surveillance of V. parahaemolyticus using tlh primers can be imprecise because amplification of a V. parahaemolyticus specific marker in V. alginolyticus and other related strains occurs. This situation complicates potentially the estimation of bacterial load in seafood, because do not ensure the correct identification of V. parahaemolyticus when his load is low.

However, for economically viable industrial applications, it is necessary to increase their catalytic activities and/or protein yields to satisfy the increasing needs for feruloyl esterases.The gene AnFaeA that encodes a type A feruloyl esterase was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris by a two-copy engineered yeast. After a screen in shaker flask, a one-copy strain GSKFA3 having the highest feruloyl esterase activity of 2.4\u00a0U/mL was obtained. Then, the pPICZ\u03b1A-AnFaeA plasmid was transformed into GSKFA3 and the transformants were grown on YPDS plates with antibiotic Zeocin. After cultivation, a two-copy strain GSKZ\u03b1FA20 with the highest feruloyl esterase activity of 15.49\u00a0U/mL was obtained. The expressed protein (recombinant AnFaeA) may be a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 40\u00a0kDa. It displayed the maximum activity at pH\u00a06.0 and 50\u00b0C, and was stable at a pH range of 4.0\u20136.5 and at below 45\u00b0C. Its activity was not significantly affected by K+, Ca2\u00a0+, Mg2\u00a0+, Cu2\u00a0+, Zn2\u00a0+, Mn2\u00a0+, Na+ and EDTA, but activated by Fe2\u00a0+. The Km and Vmax toward 4-nitrophenyl ferulate were 5.5\u00a0mM and 69.0\u00a0U/mg, respectively.The two-copy strain GSKZ\u03b1FA20 showed a 4.4-fold increase in extracellular enzyme activity compared with the one-copy strain GSKFA3. Construction of two-copy strain improved secretion of recombinant AnFaeA in P. pastoris.",

The general aim of this work is to support this idea by determining the effect of pH in the survival of the human gastric derived probiotic strain Lactobacillus salivarius UCO_979C-1 (wild type) and L. salivarius UCO_979C-2 (acclimation to pH\u00a02.6), which possesses anti-Helicobacter pylori properties.To assess this aim, the exopolysaccharide production through the phenol-sulfuric acid method was evaluated. Moreover, morphological and structural changes by transmission and scanning electron microscopy were observed. The bacterial survival was measured by viable count. The results showed that the acclimated variant strain synthesized higher levels of exopolysaccharide (690\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0mg/L) more than the wild type (450\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0mg/L). In addition, the acclimated variant preserved the viable count at pH\u00a02.6 for 48\u00a0h, whereas the wild type strain decreases after 6\u00a0h and was non-viable at 24\u00a0h.The results suggest that the acid stress acclimation of the strain L. salivarius UCO_979C-1 modified some cellular properties making this strain potentially useful as a gastric probiotic.",

However, it is still unclear whether the Jatropha curcas CPI (JcCPI) gene functions in salinity response and tolerance. In this study, the sequence of the JcCPI gene, its expression pattern, and the effects of overexpression in Escherichia coli and Nicotiana benthamiana were examined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the regulatory role of JcCPI in salinity stress tolerance.The CPI gene, designated JcCPI, was cloned from J. curcas; its sequence shared conserved domains with other plant cystatins. Based on a transcription pattern analysis, JcCPI was expressed in all tissues examined, but its expression was highest in the petiole. Additionally, the expression of JcCPI was induced by salinity stress. A potential role of JcCPI was detected in transgenic E. coli, which exhibited strong CPI activity and high salinity tolerance. JcCPI was also transferred to tobacco plants. In comparison to wild-type plants, transgenic plants expressing JcCPI exhibited increased salinity resistance, better growth performance, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, higher anti-oxidase activity, and higher cell viability under salinity stress.Based on the results of this study, overexpression of JcCPI in E. coli and N. benthamiana conferred salinity stress tolerance by blocking cysteine proteinase activity.

Nevertheless, little information has been released about C. chinensis, as far as functional genes and biosynthetic pathway of berberine are concerned. Here, we isolated a novel (S)-canadine synthase gene (designated as CAS-1) from C. chinensis by using RT-PCR and RACE techniques.Bioinformatics analysis showed that the cDNA is 1942\u00a0bp in length with a complete open reading frame (ORF) of 1476\u00a0bp, and the ORF encodes a polypeptide of 491 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 55.29\u00a0kDa and a pI value of 8.92. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that CcCAS-1 was constitutively expressed in leaf, petiole and rhizome tissues, especially in the leaves of C. chinensis. However, the results of berberine content in different tissues by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD) method showed that the leaves and the petiole tissues have similar content of berberine.We found that the berberine content in the rhizome was seven times (more or less) than that in the leaves and the petioles. In addition, the full length coding sequence of CcCAS-1 was inserted into pET-32a and was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, laying a solid foundation for protein purification, activity assay and multi-clonal antibody preparation. Together, our data suggest that CcCAS-1 is a novel heme-thiolate enzyme essential for berberine biosynthesis in C. chinensis.",

In some species, a strong relation has been described between physical aspects of the seeds and the quality of the corresponding seedlings, but this cannot be considered a general rule. The objective of this research was to identify any association between the biometric characteristics of tomato seeds and the growth and development of their seedlings.A total of 18 lots of hybrid tomato seeds were used (from indeterminate plants with round fruits), belonging to six varieties from two reproduction seasons. Each lot was evaluated for seed size and weight, and seed quality, in terms of the germination test (5 and 14\u00a0d after sowing). The number of normal roots emerged with a length above 2\u00a0mm was also evaluated at d 3, 4 and 5 after sowing. The length of the seedlings and their total and partial dry weight were measured 5\u00a0d after sowing. The results indicate that there was no association between seed size and weight and subsequent seedling emergence, and only weak correlations were found between the dry weight of the radicle and cotyledon and seed size.There is little association between the physical characteristics of the seeds and the subsequent seedlings, making it impossible to propose the use of seed weight or size as a compliment to quality evaluation tests.",

General regression neural network (GRNN), multilayer feed-forward neural networks (MLFNs) and the SVM were developed. Comparisons were made among different ANNs and the SVM.The GRNN has the lowest RMS error (457.88) and the shortest training time (1\u00a0s), with a steady fluctuation during repeated experiments, whereas the MLFNs have comparatively higher RMS errors and longer training times, which have a significant fluctuation with the change of nodes. In terms of the SVM, it also has a relatively low RMS error (466.13), with a short training time (1\u00a0s).According to the modeling results, the GRNN is considered as the most suitable ANN model for the design of the fed-batch fermentation conditions for the production of iturin A because of its high robustness and precision, and the SVM is also considered as a very suitable alternative model. Under the tolerance of 30%, the prediction accuracies of the GRNN and SVM are both 100% respectively in repeated experiments.",

They represent an environmentally friendly alternative for the control of phytopathogenic fungi. However, as it has been observed with synthetic fungicides, the possibility of inducing ITC-resistant strains is a major concern. It is, therefore, essential to understanding the molecular mechanisms of fungal resistance to ITCs. We analyzed a subtractive library containing 180 clones of an Alternaria alternata strain resistant to 2-propenyl ITC (2-pITC). After their sequencing, 141 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified using the BlastX algorithm. The sequence assembly was carried out using CAP3 software; the functional annotation and metabolic pathways identification were performed using the Blast2GO program.The bioinformatics analysis revealed 124 reads with similarities to proteins involved in transcriptional control, defense and stress pathways, cell wall integrity maintenance, detoxification, organization and cytoskeleton destabilization; exocytosis, transport, DNA damage control, ribosome maintenance, and RNA processing. In addition, transcripts corresponding to enzymes as oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, and ligases, were detected. Degradation pathways for styrene, aminobenzoate, and toluene were induced, as well as the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid and several types of N-glycan.The fungal response showed that natural compounds could induce tolerance/resistance mechanisms in organisms in the same manner as synthetic chemical products. The response of A. alternata to the toxicity of 2-pITC is a sophisticated phenomenon including the induction of signaling cascades targeting a broad set of cellular processes. Whole-transcriptome approaches are needed to elucidate completely the fungal response to 2-pITC.",

In this study, we hypothesized that ethanol laccase induced in Pycnoporus sanguineus depends on nitrogen nutriment conditions. To prove this, we assessed laccase production in submerged cultures of P. sanguineus, with different nitrogen concentrations and with, or without ethanol added in a factorial designed experiment.In order to analyze the effects of factors on the response variables, a factorial ANOVA, and response-surface models were performed. It was found that the nitrogen source was the main factor that affected laccase production in P. sanguineus. The treatments with yeast extract (2\u00a0g/L) and ethanol (3\u00a0g/L) induced the highest laccase activity (31.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9\u00a0U/L), while the treatments with urea reached the lowest activity (less than 1.6\u00a0U/L). Ethanol had positive and synergic effects on laccase production, in accordance with the surface response model, as long as simple nitrogen sources (urea) were not available.We suggest that laccase in P. sanguineus is regulated by a catabolic nitrogen repression mechanism; laccase activity is strongly inhibited by urea used as nitrogen source and it decreases when the amount of urea increases; contrarily, a synergic positive effect was observed between yeast extract and ethanol on laccase production.",

Adsorption assays were used to investigate the effect of pH, and the decrease in the clavulanic acid concentration in the culture broth was measured for each adsorbent.IRA 400 was found to be most effective, with 78% adsorption of clavulanic acid. The maximum production of clavulanic acid in Erlenmeyer flask cultures increased 86% in terms of mass of CA, and 248% in cumulative CA concentration, with the use of Amberlite IRA 400 as adsorbent in extractive fermentation, compared to control fermentation performed without product removal.The results indicated that extractive fermentation using a solid phase could be an important way of enhancing clavulanic acid titers.

This report presents the stable expression of Pectin lyase (PelA gene) and the first stable expression of manganese peroxidase (MnP-2 gene) from the chloroplast genome.pES4 and pES5 vectors were derived from pPV111A plasmid and contain the PelA and MnP-2 synthetic genes, respectively. Both genes are flanked by a synthetic rrn16S promoter and the 3\u2032UTR from rbcL gene. Efficient gene integration into both inverted repeats of the intergenic region between rrn16S and 3\u2032rps\u203212 was confirmed by Southern blot. Stable processing and expression of the RNA were confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Enzymatic activity was evaluated to detect expression and functionality of both enzymes. In general, mature plants showed more activity than young transplastomic plants. Compared to wild type plants, transplastomic events expressing pectin lyase exhibited enzymatic activity above 58.5% of total soluble protein at neutral pH and 60\u00b0C. In contrast, MnP-2 showed high activity at pH\u00a06 with optimum temperature at 65\u00b0C. Neither transplastomic plant exhibited an abnormal phenotype.This study demonstrated that hydrolytic genes PelA and MnP-2 could be integrated and expressed correctly from the chloroplast genome of tobacco plants. A whole plant, having ~\u00a0470\u00a0g of biomass could feasibly yield 66,676.25 units of pectin or 21,715.46 units of manganese peroxidase.

Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a hepcidin gene from the liver of Chinese rare minnow.The full-length cDNA of rare minnow hepcidin is 662\u00a0bp, which contains an ORF of 273\u00a0bp encoding a prepropeptide of 90 amino acid residues. The predicted prepropeptide contains three domains: a signal peptide of 24 amino acids, a prodomain of 41 amino acids, and a mature peptide of 25 amino acids. Sequence alignment showed eight conserved cysteine residues in the mature peptide, which formed four disulfide bonds in spatial structure. The deduced structure of mature peptide showed a high degree of homology to the human hepcidin. Phylogenetic analysis showed that it had a close relationship with zebrafish hepcidin, and clustered in a clade with these from Cyprinidae. Synthetic peptide of rare minnow hepcidin could inhibit the growth of Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila.These results suggested that rare minnow hepcidin had typical structure of hepcidins and antibacterial activity.

     "abstract": "The incidence of invasive mycoses is increasing worldwide. PCR-RFLP was applied to the identification of 10 reference strains and 90 cultures of agents of invasive mycoses. In addition, the new approach was applied to detect fungal agents in 120 biological samples (blood, cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow). PCR-RFLP results were compared with the ones obtained with conventional methods (culture, microscopy, and biochemical testing).The assays carried out with the reference strains (Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida guilliermondii, Cryptococcus neoformans, Cryptococcus gattii and Histoplasma capsulatum), demonstrated that the RFLP profiles were correctly predicted by the in silico investigation and allowed unequivocal identification of all chosen reference strains. The PCR-RFLP also identified 90 cultures of agents of invasive mycoses correctly, 2.5 times faster than the conventional assays. Evaluating PCR-RFLP with biological samples it was observed that the PCR was found to be 100% accurate and the RFLP profiles allowed the identification of the etiological agents: C. neoformans (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and C. gattii (n\u00a0=\u00a01) in CSF samples, H. capsulatum (n\u00a0=\u00a01) in bone marrow and C. albicans (n\u00a0=\u00a02) in blood cultures. The detection and identification by PCR-RFLP were found to be between two to ten times faster than the conventional assays.The results showed that PCR-RFLP is a valuable tool for the identification of invasive mycoses that can be implemented in hospital laboratories, allowing for a high number of clinical analyses per day.",

     "abstract": "Alkaline proteases are among the most important classes of industrial hydrolytic enzymes. The industrial demand for alkaline proteases with favorable properties continues to enhance the search for new enzymes. The present study focused on isolation of new alkaline producing alkaliphilic bacteria from hyper saline soda lakes and optimization of the enzyme production.A new potent alkaline protease producing halotolerant alkaliphilic isolate NPST-AK15 was isolated from hyper saline soda lakes, which affiliated to Bacillus sp. based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. Organic nitrogen supported enzyme production showing maximum yield using yeast extract, and as a carbon source, fructose gave maximum protease production. NPST-AK15 can grow over a broad range of NaCl concentrations (0\u201320%), showing maximal growth and enzyme production at 0\u20135%, indicated the halotolerant nature of this bacterium. Ba and Ca enhanced enzyme production by 1.6 and 1.3 fold respectively. The optimum temperature and pH for both enzyme production and cell growth were at 40\u00b0C and pH\u00a011, respectively. Alkaline protease secretion was coherent with the growth pattern, started at beginning of the exponential phase and reached maximal in mid stationary phase (36\u00a0h).A new halotolerant alkaliphilic alkaline protease producing Bacillus sp. NPST-AK15 was isolated from soda lakes. Optimization of various fermentation parameters resulted in an increase of enzyme yield by 22.8 fold, indicating the significance of optimization of the fermentation parameters to obtain commercial yield of the enzyme. NPST-AK15 and its extracellular alkaline protease with salt tolerance signify their potential applicability in the laundry industry and other applications.",

The method requirements were, first, to avoid sample pretreatment, and second, to measure glycerol precisely especially out of fermentation broth.This was achieved by combining two reaction principles \u2014 the Malaprade reaction and the Hantzsch reaction. In the Malaprade reaction, glycerol is converted into formaldehyde. This forms a dye in the Hantzsch reaction after which adsorption is than detected. The subsequent assay was investigated with two different fermentation media, a chemically undefined and a chemically defined media, used for Pichia pastoris fermentation. In both media, as well as in real fermentation samples, glycerol content could be reproducibly detected with the method. Moreover, measurements were more precise than using a standard glycerol detection kit.With this rapid assay, glycerol could be detected easily in microbial fermentation broth. It is reliable over a wide concentration range including advantages such as an easy assay set-up, a short assay time and no sample pretreatment.",

To this end, 799 markers were screened across 16 farmer preferred and other cultivated African groundnut varieties that are routinely used in groundnut improvement, some with known resistance traits.The SSR markers amplified 817 loci and were graded on a scale of 1 to 4 according to successful amplification and ease of scoring of amplified alleles. Of these, 376 markers exhibited Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) values ranging from 0.06 to 0.86, with 1476 alleles detected at an average of 3.7 alleles per locus. The remaining 423 markers were either monomorphic or did not work well. The best performing polymorphic markers were subsequently used to construct a dissimilarity matrix that indicated the relatedness of the varieties in order to aid selection of appropriately diverse parents for groundnut improvement. The closest related varieties were MGV5 and ICGV-SM 90704 and most distant were Chalimbana and 47\u201310. The mean dissimilarity value was 0.51, ranging from 0.34 to 0.66.Of the 376 informative markers identified in this study, 139 (37%) have previously been mapped to the Arachis genome and can now be employed in Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping and the additional 237 markers identified can be used to improve the efficiency of introgression of resistance to multiple important biotic constraints into farmer-preferred varieties of Sub-Saharan Africa.",

This study analysed 82 published SSR markers for finger millet across 10 diverse accessions to compile an informative set for genetic characterisation. Extensive optimization compared single samples with bulked leaf or bulked DNA samples for capturing within accession genetic diversity. The markers were evaluated to determine (1) how efficiently they amplified target loci during high-throughput genotyping with a generic PCR protocol, (2) ease of scoring PCR products and (3) polymorphism and ability to discern genetic diversity within the tested finger millet germplasm.Across 88 samples, the 52 markers that worked well amplified 274 alleles, ranging from 2 to 14 per locus with a mean of 4.89. Major allele frequency ranged from 0.18 to 0.93 with a mean of 0.57. Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) ranged from 0.13 to 0.88 with a mean of 0.5 and availability varied between 64 and 100% with a mean of 92.8%. Heterozygosity ranged from 0 to 1.0, with a mean of 0.26.Five individual samples from an accession captured the largest number of alleles per locus compared to the four different bulked sampling strategies but this difference was not significant.

The aim of this study was to compare the quantity and quality of DNA extracted from samples obtained from young mice (YM; 10\u00a0d old) and adult mice (AM; 12\u00a0weeks old). We collected samples from the tail and ear of YM and AM. We also sampled blood, check cells (via buccal swabs), hair and fecal pellets of AM, and biopsied distal phalanx of YM. We isolated DNA using commercial kits and determined concentrations and purity by spectrophotometry. The integrity of DNA was evaluated by agarose-gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).DNA in all samples was amplified successfully but the intensities of bands after electrophoresis was heterogeneous. In general, tissues from YM yielded more DNA than those from AM, with differences being statistically significant for ear samples (38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0ng/\u03bcL for YM; 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0ng/\u03bcL for AM; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006).

But little information is available concerning the actual yield, optimal extraction method and pharmacologic activity with regard to triterpenoids from Jatropha curcas leaves (TJL). Hence, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the extraction parameters. The effects of three independent variables, namely liquid-to-solid ratio, ethanol concentration and extraction time on TJL yield were investigated. TJL obtained by silica column chromatography was tested against bacterial and fungal species relevant to oral disease and wounds through broth microdilution. Antioxidant activity was assessed using the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays.A second order polynomial model produced a satisfactory fitting of the experimental data with regard to TJL yield (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.983, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The optimum extraction conditions were 16\u00a0mL/g (liquid-to-solid ratio), 70% (ethanol concentration) and 50\u00a0min (extraction time). Predicted values agreed well with the experimental values.

The process is known to generate various by-products, for example glycerol that is obtained in the making of biodiesel from rapeseed oil. Crude glycerol may be utilized in many ways, including microbial conversion to 1,3-propanediol. The main drawback of that technology is the use of high concentrations of glycerol, which inhibits the growth of bacterial cells.This study investigated the impact of crude glycerol on Clostridium butyricum DSP1 and its ability to adapt to an environment of high osmotic pressure. It was found that a crude glycerol concentration of up to 70\u00a0g/L did not have an inhibitory effect on C. butyricum DSP1. Adaptation procedures involving the passage of metabolically active biomass from a fermentation medium with a lower concentration of crude glycerol to one with a greater substrate concentration allowed breaking the barrier of high osmotic pressure (150\u00a0g/L crude glycerol) and receiving a 1,3-PD concentration of 74\u00a0g/L in a batch culture operation. The work looked into intracellular modifications shown by proteomic profiling in order to explain the mechanisms underlying the response and adaptation of bacterial cells exposed to unfavorable environmental conditions.This study of the effect of glycerol on the growth and metabolism of C. butyricum DSP1 demonstrated that the maximum substrate concentrations that do not inhibit the metabolic activity of bacterial cells are 90\u00a0g/L and 70\u00a0g/L for pure and crude glycerol, respectively.",

The kit is primarily composed of two mother vectors, co-transformation of linear DNAs into E. coli can simultaneously introduce two butanol synthetic operons into the chromosome and create two in-frame gene deletions at targeted native loci.E. coli strain Bw2V carries plasmid pCNA-PHC and pENA-TA, both utilizes native anaerobic promoter Phya for the expression of butanol synthetic enzymes. When Bw2V was subjected in anaerobic fermentation using medium containing extra glucose, the accumulated n-butanol in the broth was up to 2.8\u00a0g/L in bioreactor; as the genetic element expressing the same pathway was introduced into the genome, the titer of butanol was 1.4\u00a0g/L.The expression system using Phya is effective in applications that involve expression plasmids as also applicable in ectopic expression as single copy on the chromosome. Results imply that Phya can be subjected for broader application in bioproduction of more feedstock chemicals.",

In the present work the ability of Trichoderma viride EMCC-107 to produce high yield of coconut aroma in solid state fermentation (SSF) by using sugarcane bagasse as solid substrate was evaluated. The produced aroma was characterized.Total carbohydrates comprised the highest content (43.9% w/w) compared with the other constituents in sugarcane bagasse. The sensory and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometric (GC\u2013MS) analysis revealed that the highest odor intensity and maximum yield of volatiles were perceived at the 5th d of induction period. The unsaturated lactone, 6-pentyl-\u03b1-pyrone (6-PP), was the major identified volatile compound. Saturated lactones, \u03b4-octalactone, \u03b3-nonalactone, \u03b3-undecalactone, \u03b3-dodecalactone and \u03b4-dodecalactone, were also identified in the coconut aroma produced during the induction period (12\u00a0d). A quite correlation was found between the composition and odor profile of the produced aroma. The effect of varying the concentration of sugarcane bagasse on 6-PP production and biomass growth was evaluated. The results revealed high 6-PP production at 4.5\u00a0g sugarcane bagasse whereas the biomass showed significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase by increasing the concentration of sugarcane bagasse.The concentration of 6-PP, the most contribution of coconut aroma, produced in present study (3.62\u00a0mg/g DM) was higher than that reported in previous studies conducted under the same fermentation conditions. The significant increase in biomass with increasing the concentration of sugarcane bagasse may be attributed to the increase in sugar content that acts as carbon and energy source.",

They were identified to be Staphylococcus pasteuri and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. S. pasteuri COM-4A was cultivated in nutrient media based on coconut oil mill waste (CMW), in which it showed good growth at concentrations up to 20\u00a0g/L. While growing in such media, it was capable of producing lipase and other important extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Furthermore, the isolate was able to effectively biodegrade the CMW supplemented in the medium. Applying the Box Behnken Design of Response Surface Methodology, lead to a 1.4-fold increase in both lipase production and oil removal by the isolate. The lipase was purified 9.02-fold and the molecular weight of the monomeric enzyme was deduced to be around 56\u00a0kDa. Characterization of the enzyme revealed it to be alkaliphilic and moderately thermophilic in nature, with pH and temperature optima of 9.0 and 50\u00b0C, respectively. The enzyme was also quite stable in the presence of water-miscible organic solvents.Hence, the COM-4A lipase could be considered to be suitable for a variety of industrial applications such as in detergent formulations and in biodiesel production as well, apart from the possibility of applying it for bioremediation of fat and oil contaminants.",

The goal of this study was to develop sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers from the improved RAPD fragments for the genetic analysis of L. chinensis.The improved RAPD fragments from L. chinensis were cloned, sequenced and converted into stable SCAR markers. Sequencing of three cloned RAPD fragments revealed that the clone L7-16 consisted of 222 nucleotides (GenBank accession number KM235222), clone L9-6 consisted of 648 nucleotides (GenBank accession number KM235223), and clone L11-26 consisted of 369 nucleotides (GenBank accession number KM235224). Then, specific primers for SCAR markers L7-16, L9-6, and L11-26 were designed and synthesized. PCR amplification was performed using DNA templates from 24 different samples, including 6 samples of L. chinensis and other plants. The SCAR marker L9-6 was specific for all of the L. chinensis samples, the SCAR marker L11-26 specific for five L. chinensis samples, and the SCAR marker L7-16 only specific for the samples from Luzhou.This study developed stable SCAR markers for the identification of L. chinensis by the cloning of the improved RAPD fragments.

In Italy, most of the almonds produced are cultivated in the southern part of the country. Local populations of the tree in Sardinia are largely seed-derived and mostly self-incompatible, so have developed extensive genetic diversity. The need to protect biodiversity has prompted a revived interest in local genetic materials in almond. Two Italian collections have been established, one in Sardinia and the other in Apulia. These collections were the focus of the present evaluation of genetic diversity.Eleven SSRs (microsatellites) were used for fingerprinting. The Sardinian germplasm was highly polymorphic, revealing a mean of 14.5 alleles per locus and a mean heterozygosity of 0.71. Using a model-based clustering approach, two genetic clusters were distinguished: one included all the commercial varieties and most of the Sardinian accessions, and the other most of the Apulian accessions. A similar structure was produced using a distance-based cluster analysis. The Sardinian accessions could still be distinguished from the commercial germplasm with few exceptions.The extensive genetic variability present in the Sardinian and Apulian almond germplasm indicates that these materials represent an important source of genes for the improvement of the crop.",

The genomic DNA methylation variations have been detected by methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) molecular markers, and the result showed that after NiCl2 treatment, there was methylation variation in T0 generation seedlings, and partial site changes maintained in T1 generation, which suggested that the effects of NiCl2 on DNA methylation could be heritable in offspring.

In the nucleolus, there was an increased cytosine methylation in 18S rDNA. The plant nucleolus variation and 18S rDNA methylation may be used as an examination indicator for Ni pollution in soil or plant.NiCl2 application caused variation of DNA methylation of the Arabidopsis genomic and offspring's.

Generally, only a small part of microspore-derived embryos is used for plant regeneration, without any knowledge about their properties. Therefore, the possibility of early detection of desirable genotypes bearing a single dominant nuclear fertility restorer (Rfo) gene, can double the success of selection and reduce the production costs.To maximize the efficiency and yield of regenerated microspore-derived embryos (MDEs) with the Rfo gene, a protocol for reliable and early, non-destructive selection of desired MDE genotypes was developed. The total amount of 636 cotyledonary embryos was tested by PCR, out of which 37% (237/636) were shown to bear the Rfo gene (instead of 50% according to the expected 1:1 segregation ratio for a single copy gene) and 218 of these fertility restorer plants were fully grown to flowering stage. New molecular marker has been demonstrated to have 100% of co-segregation with the phenotypic evaluation.Technique developed in this study provides early and non-destructive sampling of embryonic tissue and the use of new markers for simple and efficient control of the presence of Rfo gene in all accessions.",

To explore the antimicrobial role of this non-enzymatic lysozyme and model its structure to novel antimicrobial peptides, the peptide from the C-terminal amino acid residues 70\u2013146 of the sea cucumber lysozyme in Stichopus japonicus (SjLys-C) was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS.The fusion protein system led to over-expression of the soluble and highly stable product, an approximate 26\u00a0kDa recombinant SjLys-C protein (rSjLys-C). The present study showed that rSjLys-C displayed strong antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, the heat-treated rSjLys-C exhibited more inhibitive activity than the native rSjLys-C. The structural analysis of SjLys-C showed that it is a typical hydrophilic peptide and contains a helix-loop-helix motif. The modeling of SjLys-C molecular structures at different temperatures revealed that the tertiary structure of SjLys-C at 100\u00b0C underwent a conformational change which is favorable for enhancing antimicrobial activity.These results indicate that the expressed rSjLys-C is a highly soluble product and has a strong antimicrobial activity. Therefore, gaining a large quantity of biologically active rSjLys-C will be used for further biochemical and structural studies and provide a potential use in aquaculture and medicine.",

However, it is not known whether banana ASR genes confer salt stress tolerance. The contexts of the study was to analysis the sequence characterization of banana ASR1, and identify its expression patterns and function under salt stress using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and overexpression in Arabidopsis. The purpose was to evaluate the role of banana ASR1 to salt stress tolerance employed by plants.A full-length cDNA isolated from banana fruit was named MaASR1, and it had a 432\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 143 amino acids. MaASR1 was preferential expression in roots and leaves compared to low expression in fruits, rhizomes and flowers. Under salt stress, the expression of MaASR1 quickly increased and highest expression level was detected in roots and leaves at 4\u00a0h, and then gradually decreased. These results suggested that MaASR1 expression was induced under salt stress. MaASR1 protein was localized in the nucleus and plasma membrane. MaASR1 was transformed to Arabidopsis and verified by southern and northern analysis, transgenic lines L14 and L38 integrated one and two copies of MaASR1, respectively, while overexpression in transgenic lines provided evidence for the role of MaASR1 to salt stress tolerance.This study demonstrated that overexpression of MaASR1 in Arabidopsis confers salt stress tolerance by reducing the expression of ABA/stress-responsive genes, but does not affect the expression of the ABA-independent pathway and biosynthesis pathway genes.",

More than 25 terpenoids have been isolated from this plant, and their activities are anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, insecticidal, rodenticidal, cytotoxic and molluscicidal. But not much is known about the pathway involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. The present investigation describes the cloning, characterization and subcellular localization of isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI) gene from J. curcas. IPI is one of the rate limiting enzymes in the biosynthesis of terpenoids, catalyzing the crucial interconversion of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP).A full-length JcIPI cDNA consisting of 1355\u00a0bp was cloned. It encoded a protein of 305 amino acids. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequence predicted the presence of conserved active sites, metal binding sites and the NUDIX motif, which were consistent with other IPIs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a significant evolutionary relatedness with Ricinus communis. Southern blot analysis showed the presence of an IPI multigene family in J. curcas. Comparative expression analysis of tissue specific JcIPI demonstrated the highest transcript level in flowers. Abiotic factors could induce the expression of JcIPI. Subcellular distribution showed that JcIPI was localized in chloroplasts.This is the first report of cloning and characterization of IPI from J. curcas. Our study will be of significant interest to understanding the regulatory role of IPI in the biosynthesis of terpenoids, although its function still needs further confirmation.",

Long-term rainless conditions and seasonal droughts can limit peanut yields and were conducive to preharvest aflatoxin contamination. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which peanut responds and adapts to water limited conditions, we isolated and characterized several drought-induced genes from peanut roots using a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique.RNA was extracted from peanut roots subjected to a water stress treatment (45% field capacity) and from control plants (75% field capacity), and used to generate an SSH cDNA library. A total of 111 non-redundant sequences were obtained, with 80 unique transcripts showing homology to known genes and 31 clones with no similarity to either hypothetical or known proteins. GO and KEGG analyses of these differentially expressed ESTs indicated that drought-related responses in peanut could mainly be attributed to genes involved in cellular structure and metabolism. In addition, we examined the expression patterns of seven differentially expressed candidate genes using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and confirmed that all were up-regulated in roots in response to drought stress, but to differing extents.We successfully constructed an SSH cDNA library in peanut roots and identified several drought-related genes. Our results serve as a foundation for future studies into the elucidation of the drought stress response mechanisms of peanut.",

     "abstract": "The production of biofuels from renewable energy sources is one of the most important issues in industrial biotechnology today. The process is known to generate various by-products, for example crude glycerol, which is obtained in the making of biodiesel from rapeseed oil. Crude glycerol may be utilized in many ways, including microbial conversion to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), a raw material for the synthesis of polyesters and polyurethanes.The paper presents results of a study on the synthesis of 1,3-propanediol from crude glycerol by a repeated batch method with the use of Clostridium butyricum DSP1. Three cycles of fermentation medium replacement were carried out. The final concentration of 1,3-PD was 62\u00a0g/L and the maximum productivity, obtained during the second cycle, reached 1.68\u00a0g/L/h. Additionally, experiments conducted in parallel to the above involved using the entire quantity of the culture broth removed from the bioreactor to inoculate successive portions of fermentation media containing crude glycerol at concentrations of 80\u00a0g/L and 100\u00a0g/L. Under those conditions, the maximum 1,3-PD concentrations were 43.2\u00a0g/L and 54.2\u00a0g/L.The experiments proved that by using a portion of metabolically active biomass as inoculum for another fermentation formula it is possible to eliminate the stage of inoculum growth and thereby reduce the length of the whole operation. Additionally, that strategy avoids the phase of microbial adaptation to a different source of carbon such as crude glycerol, which is more difficult to utilize, thus improving the kinetic parameters of 1,3-PD production.",

The knowledge on the changes of activities of inulin synthesizing and degrading enzymes is limited during plant sprouting, growth and dormancy. It happens due to complicated measurements of the product of enzymatic reaction in the presence of crude plant extract. Fructan exohydrolase (\u03b2-d-fructan fructohydrolase, FEH, EC 3.2.1.80) is an enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of fructans in plants. For fructose as the reaction product measurement, a high-performance liquid chromatography is usually used. The aim of the study was to choose a simple and suitable method for FEH activity determination and the measurement of fructose in the presence of plant extracts.Two chemical methods, i.e. copper(II)\u2013neocuproine and 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, and the enzymatic one based on the reactions catalyzed by hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were used. Enzymatic method was found to be suitable for FEH activity determination in plant extracts, and on the contrary to chemical methods no interference effects of compounds from crude plant extracts were observed.Enzymatic method is applicable for the routine analysis and will allow performing the investigations without special equipment on the inulin degrading enzyme in biotechnologically important crops.",

However, this production can be partially impaired by two-spotted spider mite (TSSM) Tetranychus urticae Koch infestations, due to decreases in the quality and quantity of fruit. Since there are no data in the literature about alterations caused by TSSM infestation in strawberry plants, our work aimed towards evaluating nutritional and physicochemical parameters of TSSM-infested strawberry plants, along with the related chemical treatment (CT) (acaricide) or biological treatment (predatory mite Phytoseiulus macropilis Banks).Strawberry fruit from TSSM-infested plants present the highest levels of acidity and exhibit low levels of anthocyanin and phenolic compounds, while fruit from TSSM-infested plants\u00a0+\u00a0biological control using predatory mite shows high levels of soluble solids, phenolic compounds and ascorbic acid, along with a high soluble solid content/titratable (SSC/TA) acidity ratio, which indicates high quality fruit.Our results suggest that TSSM infestation decreases fruit quality and that the biological control of TSSM using a predatory mite is a suitable alternative to organic production, since the presence of predatory mite does not affect fruit quality and development.",

Our objective was to develop a technique for restoring endangered birds by developing interspecies germ line chimeras between pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and chicken (Gallus gallus) with SSCs.SSCs were isolated from the surgically removed testis of a pheasant. Growth conditions for pheasant SSCs were established by co-culturing STO (SIM mouse embryo-derived thioguanine and ouabain resistant) cells and pheasant SSCs. The colony-forming cells divided and proliferated stably to yield an established SSC line. Pheasant SSCs showed strong reactivity for GDNF family receptor alpha1 (GFR\u03b11) marker. Finally, production of germ line chimeras was attempted by transferring pheasant SSCs into recipient embryos. Although final embryo survival was 5.6% (20/354), the initial survival rate was 88% (312/354). To measure the percent transfer of donor SSC to gonads, the pheasant SSCs were labeled with PKH 26 fluorescent dye. We observed 30% donor cells and 9.48% c-kit/CD117-positive cells in the gonads of recipient chickens. Donor SSCs were thus stably engrafted in the recipient gonads.This study showed that SSCs can be used as a tool for the conservation of endangered birds and the production of germ line chimeras. Our findings yield insights into how we may use the pheasant spermatogonial stem cell line for efficient production of interspecies germ line chimeras and ultimately, to the restoration of endangered birds.",

Here, we have studied the fermentative capacity of different auxotrophic mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which are routinely used as hosts for the production of heterologous proteins.

In this work the performance of auxotrophic S. cerevisiae CEN.PK strains was compared to the corresponding prototrophic strain, to S. cerevisiae T5bV, a strain isolated from grape must and to another auxotrophic strain, S. cerevisiae BY4741.The results indicate that the fermentative capacity of strains grown in 2% glucose was similar in all the strains tested. However, in 15% initial glucose, the auxotrophic strains exhibited a more than doubled ethanol yield on biomass (10\u00a0g\u00a0g-\u00a01dw) compared to the prototrophic strains (less than 5\u00a0g\u00a0g-\u00a01dw). Other tests have also evidenced that in medium depletion conditions, ethanol production continues after growth arrest.The results highlight the capacity of auxotrophic yeast strains to produce ethanol per mass unit, in a higher amount with respect to the prototrophic ones. This leads to potential applications for auxotrophic strains of S. cerevisiae in the production of ethanol in both homogeneous and heterogeneous phases (immobilized systems). The higher ethanol yield on biomass would be advantageous in immobilized cell systems, as a reduced yeast biomass could greatly reduce the mass transfer limitations through the immobilization matrix.",

In this process, the consumption of nitrogen is of great importance since it is found in limiting quantities and its deficiency produces sluggish and/or stuck fermentations generating large economic losses in the wine-making industry. In a previous work we compared the transcriptional profiles between genetically related strains with differences in nitrogen consumption, detecting genes with differential expression that could be associated to the differences in the levels of nitrogen consumed. One of the genes identified was ICY1. With the aim of confirming this observation, in the present work we evaluated the consumption of ammonium during the fermentation of strains that have deleted or overexpressed this gene.Our results confirm the effect of ICY1 on nitrogen uptake by evaluating its expression in wine yeasts during the first stages of fermentation under low (MS60) and normal (MS300) assimilable nitrogen. Our results show that the mRNA levels of ICY1 diminish when the amount of assimilable nitrogen is low. Furthermore, we constructed strains derived from the industrial strain EC1118 as a null mutant in this gene as well as one that overexpressed it.Our results suggest that the expression of ICY1 is regulated by the amount of nitrogen available in the must and it is involved in the consumption of ammonium, given the increase in the consumption of this nitrogen source observed in the null mutant strain.",

In this study, the effects of EOS, WOS and SOS on the activities of the defense-related enzymes, namely phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) in its host plant Dioscorea zingiberensis cultures were investigated.For the suspension cell cultures of D. zingiberensis, the highest PAL activity was induced by 0.5\u00a0mg/mL of WOS at 48\u00a0h after treatment, which was 4.55-fold as that of control. Both PPO and POD activities were increased to the maximum values by 0.25\u00a0mg/mL of WOS at 48\u00a0h after treatment, which were respectively 3.74 and 3.45-fold as those of control. For the seedling cultures, the highest PAL activity was elicited by 2.5\u00a0mg/mL of EOS at 48\u00a0h after treatment, which was 3.62-fold as that of control. Both PPO and POD reached their maximum values treated with 2.5\u00a0mg/mL of WOS at 48\u00a0h after treatment, which were 4.61 and 4.19-fold as those of control, separately.Both EOS and WOS significantly increased the activities of PAL, PPO and POD in the suspension cell and seedling cultures of D. zingiberensis.

It was an integral membrane protein performing the last step in the de novo biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). In recent years, PtdIns has been considered to play an essential role in energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolic pathway and intracellular signal transduction in eukaryotic cells.In this study, the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that the expression of CDIPT gene was remarkably different in diverse tissues. We also detected the polymorphism of bovine CDIPT gene and analyzed its association with body measurement and meat quality traits of Qinchuan cattle. Blood samples were obtained from 638 Qinchuan cattle aged from 18 to 24\u00a0months. DNA sequencing and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to find CDIPT gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Three SNPs g.244T>C (NCBI: rs42069760), g.1496G>A and g.1514G>A were found in this study. g.244T>C located at 5\u2032untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) of exon 1 showed three genotypes: TT, TC and CC. g.1496G>A and g.1514G>A detected the first time were located in intron 3 and showed the same genotypes: GG, GA and AA.Analysis results showed that these three SNPs were significantly associated with body measurement traits (BMTs) and meat quality traits (MQTs).

Six ovine and bovine MS located on chromosomes 2 and 6 of sheep genome were genotyped on 294 individual from ten geographical regions.The number of alleles per locus (A), the expected heterozygosity (He) and observed heterozygosity (Ho) were measured. Overall A, He and Ho were 12.67, 0.820 and 0.684, respectively. On the other hand, genetic distances undoubtedly revealed the expected degree of differentiation among the studied populations. The finding showed closeness of three populations from south (Maan, Showbak and Tafeilah) to each other. Populations from the middle regions of Jordan (Karak, Madaba, Amman, AzZarqa and Mafraq) were found to be in one cluster. Only two populations of the middle region were an exception: AlSalt and Dead Sea. Finally, sheep populations from Irbid were located in separated cluster. It was clear that the studied predefined populations were subdivided from four populations and would be most probably accounted as ancestral populations. These results indicate that number of population is less than the predefined population as ten based on geographical sampling areas.The possible inference might be that geographical location, genetic migration, similar selection forces, and common ancestor account for population admixture and subdivision of Awassi sheep breed in Jordan. Finally, the present study sheds new light on the molecular and population genetics of Awassi sheep from different regions of Jordan and to utilize the possible findings for future management of genetic conservation under conditions of climate changes and crossbreeding policy.",

     "abstract": "Treating latex rubber sheet wastewater often leads to the generation of a rotten-egg odor from toxic H2S. To increase the treatment efficiency and eliminate H2S, purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB), prepared by supplementing non-sterile rubber sheet wastewater (RAW) with fermented pineapple extract (FPE), were used to treat this wastewater under microaerobic light conditions. The following 3 independent variables: chemical oxygen demand (COD), initial pH and FPE dose were investigated using the Box\u2013Behnken design to find optimal conditions for stimulating the growth of indigenous PNSB (PNSBsi).The addition of 2.0% FPE into RAW, which had a COD of 2000\u00a0mg\u00a0L-\u00a01 and an initial pH of 7.0, significantly decreased oxidation reduction potential (ORP) value and stimulated PNSBsi to reach a maximum of 7.8\u00a0log\u00a0cfu\u00a0mL-\u00a01 within 2\u00a0d. Consequently, these PNSBsi, used as inoculants, were investigated for their ability to treat the wastewater under microaerobic light conditions. A central composite design was used to determine the optimal conditions for the wastewater treatment. These proved to be 7% PNSBsi, 0.8% FPE and 4\u00a0d retention time and this combination resulted in a reduction of 91% for COD, 75% for suspended solids, 61% for total sulfide while H2S was not detected. Results of abiotic control and treatment sets indicated that H2S was produced by heterotrophic bacteria and it was then effectively deactivated by PNSBsi.The stimulation of PNSB growth by FPE under light condition was to lower ORP, and PNSBsi proved to be effective for treating the wastewater.",

Some products are accepted only when they are pigmented with natural, food-quality colorants: for example poultry products (manly marigold flower extracts). Carotenoids such as \u03b2-carotene, \u03b2-criptoxanthin and lutein are very attractive as natural food colorants due to their antioxidant and pro-vitamin activities which provide additional value to the target products. Marigold (Tagetes erecta) is an Asteraceous ornamental plant native to Mexico, and it is also important as a carotenoid source for industrial and medicinal purposes but nowadays its production is destined mainly for ornamental purposes.Friable callus of T. erecta yellow flower (YF) and white flower (WF) varieties was induced from leaf explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 9.0\u00a0\u03bcM 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 8.8\u00a0\u03bcM benzyladenine (BA). Calluses developed from both varieties were different in pigmentation. Extract characterization from callus cultures was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This analytical process detected several carotenoids; the main pigments in extracts from YF callus were lutein and zeaxanthin, whereas in the extracts of the WF callus the main pigments were lutein, zeaxanthin, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and \u03b2-carotene. Callus cultures of T. erecta accumulated pigments even after several rounds of subculture.WF callus appeared to be a suitable candidate as a source of different carotenoids, and tested varieties could represent an alternative for further studies about in vitro pigment production.",

In this topic, only the ascomycete Trichoderma spp. has been studied broadly. However, fungal ligninolytic-filamentous microfungi biodiversity interaction in nature is abundant and poorly studied. The enhancement of laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) activities of Trametes maxima as a function of time inoculation of Paecilomyces carneus and under several culture conditions using Plackett\u2013Burman experimental design (PBED) were investigated.The highest increases of laccase (12,382.5\u00a0U/mg protein) and MnP (564.1\u00a0U/mg protein) activities were seen in co-cultures I3 and I5, respectively, both at 10\u00a0d after inoculation. This level of activity was significantly different from the enzyme activity in non-inoculated T. maxima (4881.0\u00a0U/mg protein and 291.8\u00a0U/mg protein for laccase and MnP, respectively). PBED results showed that laccase was increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) by high levels of glucose, (NH4)2SO4 and MnSO4 and low levels of KH2PO4, FeSO4 and inoculum (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Sanitary problems in farms are addressed by the prevention of disease outbreaks or by the treatment of diseases with chemicals. Environmental and governmental restrictions, toxicity and high treatment costs limit the use of drugs. Marine organisms, such as algae, sponges and corals, have developed an antimicrobial defense strategy based on the production of bioactive metabolites. Among these organisms, seaweeds offer a particularly rich source of potential new drugs. Hence, many pharmacologically active substances have been isolated from seaweeds. In the Ceramium genus, Ceramium rubrum has been emphasized by several authors for its antimicrobial properties. Based on this background, the present study focused on the antimicrobial activity of a lipophilic extract of C. rubrum on Y. ruckeri and S. parasitica.The alga, collected from the Pacific coast of Chile, underwent an ethanol extraction, and the concentrated extract was partitioned between water and dichloromethane. From the dichloromethane extract, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, one hydrocarbon and phytol were identified by Gas Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. The antimicrobial study showed that the whole extract was more active than the individual components, which suggests a strong synergistic effect among the components.These results may constitute a basis for promising future applied research that could investigate the use of C. rubrum seaweed as a source of antimicrobial compounds against fish pathogens.",

In this study, genomic DNA sequences homologous to the gene encoding one of the large subunits of the enzyme were amplified from 10 accessions of the genus Musa, including representatives of wild ancestors (AA and BB genomes), dessert bananas (AA, AAA, AB and AAB genomes), plantains (AAB genome) and cooking bananas (ABB and AAA genomes), and studied in order to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) base variations in Musa accessions.In the 810-base pair amplicons of the AGPase large sub-unit (LSU) gene analyzed in ten Musa accessions, a total of 36 SNPs and insertions/deletions (indels) were found. The phylogenetic analysis revealed fifteen distinct haplotypes, which were grouped into four variants. Deep examination of SNPs in the 2nd exon in the LSU of AGPase showed that at seven locations, five SNPs altered their amino acid sequence.This work reveals the possible number of AGPase enzyme isoforms and their molecular levels in banana. Molecular markers could be designed from SNPs present in these banana accessions.

The main problem of this technology is using a high concentration of glycerol, which is a limiting factor for bacteria cells growth (especially in batch fermentation).In this work, the influence of different glycerol concentration in batch fermentation on Clostridium butyricum DSP1 metabolism was investigated. The biomass was concentrated for two times with the use of membrane module (in case of increasing kinetic parameters). Increased optical density of bacteria cells six times increased the productivity of 1,3-PD in cultivation with 20\u00a0g/L of glycerol at the beginning of the process, and more than two times in cultivation with 60\u201380\u00a0g/L.

     "abstract": "In biodegradation processes free enzymes often undergo deactivation. Thus, it is very important to obtain highly stable enzymes by different methods. Immobilization allows for successful stabilization of many multimeric enzymes by increasing the rigidity of the enzyme structure. This study aimed to evaluate some environmental factors that affect catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia KB2 immobilized in alginate hydrogel. The goal of the present work was to improve the functional stability of the enzyme by increasing its structural rigidity.Immobilization yield and expressed activity were 100% and 56%, respectively. Under the same storage conditions, the activity of the immobilized enzyme was still observed on the 28th\u00a0d of incubation at 4\u00b0C, whereas the free enzyme lost its activity after 14\u00a0d. The immobilized enzyme required approximately 10\u00b0C lower temperature for its optimal activity than the free enzyme. Immobilization shifted the optimal pH from 8 for the soluble enzyme to 7 for the immobilized enzyme. The immobilized catechol 1,2-dioxygenase showed activity against 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, 3-chlorocatechol, 4-chlorocatechol, and 3,5-dichlorocatechol. The immobilization of the enzyme promoted its stabilization against any distorting agents: aliphatic alcohols, phenols, and chelators.The entrapment of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from S. maltophilia KB2 has been shown to be an effective method for improving the functional properties of the enzyme. Increased resistance to inactivation by higher substrate concentration and other factors affecting enzyme activity as well as broadened substrate specificity compared to the soluble enzyme, makes the immobilized catechol 1,2-dioxygenase suitable for the bioremediation and detoxification of xenobiotic-contaminated environments.",

     "abstract": "Aspartic proteases are a subfamily of endopeptidases that are useful in a variety of applications, especially in the food processing industry. Here we describe a novel aspartic protease that was purified from Peptidase R, a commercial protease preparation derived from Rhizopus oryzae.An aspartic protease sourced from Peptidase R was purified to homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography followed by polishing with a hydrophobic interaction chromatography column, resulting in a 3.4-fold increase in specific activity (57.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0U/mg) and 58.8% recovery. The estimated molecular weight of the purified enzyme was 39\u00a0kDa. The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein exhibited 63\u201375% identity to rhizopuspepsins from various Rhizopus species. The enzyme exhibited maximal activity at 75\u00b0C in glycine\u2013HCl buffer, pH\u00a03.4 with casein as the substrate. The protease was stable at 35\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min and had an observed half-life of approximately 30\u00a0min at 45\u00b0C. Enzyme activity was not significantly inhibited by chelation with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and the addition of metal ions to EDTA-treated protease did not significantly change enzyme activity, indicating that proteolysis is not metal ion-dependent. The purified enzyme was completely inactivated by the aspartic protease inhibitor Pepstatin A.Based on the observed enzyme activity, inhibition profile with Pepstatin A, and sequence similarity to other rhizopuspepsins, we have classified this enzyme as an aspartic protease.",

     "abstract": "Weedy rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a noxious form of cultivated rice (O. sativa L.) associated with intensive rice production and dry seeding. A cost-efficient strategy to control this weed is the Clearfield rice production system, which combines imidazolinone herbicides with mutant imidazolinone-resistant rice varieties. However, imidazolinone resistance mutations can be introgressed in weedy rice populations by natural outcrossing, reducing the life span of the Clearfield technology. Timely and accurate detection of imidazolinone resistance mutations in weedy rice may contribute to avoiding the multiplication and dispersion of resistant weeds and to protect the Clearfield system. Thus, highly sensitive and specific methods with high throughput and low cost are needed. KBioscience\u2019s Allele Specific PCR (KASP) is a codominant, competitive allele-specific PCR-based genotyping method. KASP enables both alleles to be detected in a single reaction in a closed-tube format. The aim of this work is to assess the suitability and validity of the KASP method for detection in weedy rice of the three imidazolinone resistance mutations reported to date in rice.Validation was carried out by determining the analytical performance of the new method and comparing it with conventional allele-specific PCR, when genotyping sets of cultivated and weedy rice samples. The conventional technique had a specificity of 0.97 and a sensibility of 0.95, whereas for the KASP method, both parameters were 1.00.The new method has equal accuracy while being more informative and saving time and resources compared with conventional methods, which make it suitable for monitoring imidazolinone-resistant weedy rice in Clearfield rice fields.",

     "abstract": "Yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) is a root crop native to the Andean region. Low sexual reproductive capacity is a major constraint facing the genetic breeding of this crop. Biotechnological techniques offer alternative ways to widen genetic variability. We investigated somaclonal variation in regenerants of yacon derived from in vitro somatic embryogenesis using simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis and flow cytometry.Twenty tested ISSR primers provided a total of 7848 bands in 60 in vitro regenerants and control plant. The number of bands for each primer varied from 3 to 10, and an average of 6.95 bands was obtained per ISSR primer. Eight primers were polymorphic and generated 10 polymorphic bands with 7.19% mean polymorphism. ISSR analysis revealed genetic variability in 6 plants under study. These regenerants had Jaccard's distances 0.104, 0.020, 0.040, 0.106, 0.163 and 0.040. Flow cytometric analysis did not reveal changes of relative nuclear DNA content in regenerants suggesting that the plants obtained via somatic embryogenesis had maintained stable octoploid levels.Our findings show that indirect somatic embryogenesis could be used in yacon improvement to widen genetic variability, especially when low sexual reproductive capacity hinders classical ways of breeding.",

     "abstract": "The quality of wheat grain depends on several characteristics, among which the composition of high molecular weight glutenin subunits, encoded by Glu-1 loci, are the most important. Application of biotechnological tools to accelerate the attainment of homozygous lines may influence the proportion of segregated genotypes. The objective was to determine, whether the selection pressure generated by the methods based on in vitro cultures, may cause a loss of genotypes with desirable Glu-1 alleles.Homozygous lines were derived from six winter wheat crosses by pollination with maize (DH-MP), anther culture (DH-AC) and single seed descent (SSD) technique. Androgenetically-derived plants that originated from the same callus were examined before chromosome doubling using allele-specific and microsatellite markers. It was found that segregation distortion in SSD and DH-MP populations occurred only in one case, whereas in anther-derived lines they were observed in five out of six analyzed combinations.Segregation distortion in DH-AC populations was caused by the development of more than one plant of the same genotype from one callus. This distortion was minimized if only one plant per callus was included in the population. Selection of haploid wheat plants before chromosome doubling based on allele-specific markers allows us to choose genotypes that possess desirable Glu-1 alleles and to reduce the number of plants in the next steps of DH production. The SSD technique appeared to be the most advantageous in terms of Mendelian segregation, thus the occurrence of residual heterozygosity can be minimized by continuous selfing beyond the F6 generation.",

     "abstract": "Algae offer many advantages as biofuel sources including: high growth rates, high lipid content, the ability to grow on non-agricultural land, and the genetic versatility to improve strains rapidly and produce co-products. Research is ongoing to make algae biofuels a more financially attractive energy option; however, it is becoming evident that the economic viability of algae-based fuels may hinge upon high-value co-products. This work evaluated the feasibility of using a co-product, algae extract, as a nutrient source in cell culture media.Algae extract prepared from autolysed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was found to contain 3.0% protein, 9.2% total carbohydrate, and 3.9% free \u03b1-amino acid which is similar to the nutrient content of commercially available yeast extract. The effects of algae extract on the growth and metabolism of laboratory strains of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested by substituting algae extract for yeast extract in LB and YPAD growth media recipes. Complex laboratory media supplemented with algae extract instead of yeast extract showed markedly improved effects on the growth and metabolism of common laboratory microorganisms in all cases except ethanol production rates in yeast.This study showed that algae extract derived from C. reinhardtii is similar, if not superior, to commercially available yeast extract in nutrient content and effects on the growth and metabolism of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Bacto\u2122 yeast extract is valued at USD $0.15\u20130.35 per gram, if algae extract was sold at similar prices, it would serve as a high-value co-product in algae-based fuel processes.",

     "abstract": "Rice is globally one of the most important food crops, and NaCl stress is a key factor reducing rice yield. Amelioration of NaCl stress was assessed by determining the growth of rice seedlings treated with culture supernatants containing 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) secreted by strains of Rhodopseudomonas palustris (TN114 and PP803) and compared to the effects of synthetic ALA (positive control) and no ALA content (negative control).The relative root growth of rice seedlings was determined under NaCl stress (50\u00a0mM NaCl), after 21\u00a0d of pretreatment. Pretreatments with 1\u00a0\u03bcM commercial ALA and 10X diluted culture supernatant of strain TN114 (2.57\u00a0\u03bcM ALA) gave significantly better growth than 10X diluted PP803 supernatant (2.11\u00a0\u03bcM ALA). Rice growth measured by dry weight under NaCl stress ordered the pretreatments as: commercial ALA\u00a0>\u00a0TN114\u00a0>\u00a0PP803\u00a0>\u00a0negative control. NaCl stress strongly decreased total chlorophyll of the plants that correlated with non-photochemical quenching of fluorescence (NPQ). The salt stress also strongly increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration in NaCl-stressed plants. The pretreatments were ordered by reduction in H2O2 content under NaCl stress as: commercial ALA\u00a0>\u00a0TN114\u00a0>\u00a0PP803\u00a0>\u00a0negative control. The ALA pretreatments incurred remarkable increases of total chlorophyll and antioxidative activities of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxide (APx), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); under NaCl stress commercial ALA and TN114 had generally stronger effects than PP803.The strain TN114 has potential as a plant growth stimulating bacterium that might enhance rice growth in saline paddy fields at a lower cost than commercial ALA.",

For this purpose, the molecular diversity of 32 A. auricula-judae commercial cultivars in China was analyzed by using the nuclear ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer.The complete nuclear rDNA gene complex of A. auricula-judae isolate is 11,210\u00a0bp long, and contains the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA gene as well as the ITS and IGS regions. Based on the sequence data, four more effective primer combinations for the IGS region of A. auricula-judae were designed. Nucleotide sequence variation in the IGS among 32 A. auricula-judae commercial cultivars in China sorted into three strongly supported clades, which is correlated with geographical regions. Most strains originated from the same area were with a narrow genetic basis and could possibly be domesticated from the local wild-type strains.The grouping information obtained in the present work provides significant information for further genetic improvement in A. auricula-judae, and suggested that the IGS region can be used as an excellent tool for identification of genetic variation.",
