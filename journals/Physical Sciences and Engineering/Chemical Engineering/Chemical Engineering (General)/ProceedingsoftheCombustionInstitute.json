     "abstract": "Chemical-Looping Combustion (CLC) has emerged in recent years as a very promising combustion technology for power plants and industrial applications with inherent CO2 capture, which circumvent the energy penalty imposed on other competing technologies. The process is based on the use of a metal oxide to transport the oxygen needed for combustion in order to prevent direct contact between the fuel and air. CLC is performed in two interconnected reactors, and the CO2 separation inherent to the process practically eliminates the energy penalty associated with gas separation. The CLC process was initially developed for gaseous fuels, and its application was subsequently extended to solid fuels. The process has been demonstrated in units of different size, from bench scale to MW-scale pilot plants, burning natural gas, syngas, coal and biomass, and using ores and synthetic materials as oxygen-carriers.An overview of the status of the process, starting with the fundamentals and considering the main experimental results and characteristics of process performance, is made both for gaseous and solid fuels. Process modelling of the system for solid and gaseous fuels is also analysed. The main research needs and challenges both for gaseous and solid fuel are highlighted.",

     "abstract": "This paper reports the effect of water vapour on particulate matter (PM) during the separate combustion of in situ volatiles and char generated from chromated-copper-arsenate-treated (CCAT) wood at 1300\u00a0\u00b0C. Combustion of in situ volatiles produces only PM with aerodynamic diameter\u202f<1\u202f\u00b5m (i.e., PM1), dominantly PM with aerodynamic diameter\u202f<0.1\u202f\u00b5m (i.e., PM0.1). Water vapour could significantly enhance the nucleation, coagulation and condensation of fine particles and reduce the capture of Na and K by the alumina reactor tube via reduced formation of alkali aluminates, leading to increases in both yield and modal diameter of PM0.1. Water vapour could also enhance char fragmentation hence increase the yield of PM with aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 10\u202f\u00b5m (i.e., PM1\u201310) during char combustion. For trace elements, during in situ volatiles combustion, volatile elements (As, Cr, Ni, Cu and Pb) are only presented in PM1 and water vapour alters the particle size distributions (PSDs) but has little effect on the yields of these trace elements. During char combustion, As, Cr, Cu and Ni are present in both PM1 and PM1\u201310 while the non-volatile Mn and Ti are only present in PM1\u201310. Increasing water vapour content increases the yields of As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn and Ti in PM1-10 due to enhanced char fragmentation. During char combustion, water vapour also originates less oxidising conditions locally for enhancing As release, promotes the generation of gaseous chromium oxyhydroxides and inhabits the production of NiCl2 (g), leading to increased yields of As and Cr and decreased yield of Ni in PM0.1.",

     "abstract": "To utilize sustainable biofuel, the current study proposes a novel combustion technique that directly burns liquid ethanol without a spray system. Two swirling air flows are induced by tangentially injected the gas from two concentric tubes at different stages. The liquid ethanol is fed by a liquid tank at the center. At the beginning methane flame assists in preheating the system to vaporize liquid ethanol and ignite the vapor. Thereafter methane is switched off, and liquid ethanol can be continuously vaporized through self-burning released heat. The heat and mass transfer processes are examined to illustrate such self-sustained burning\u2013heating\u2013evaporating system. The ethanol flow rate is gradually increased to provide different heat output. The flame structures, temperature distributions and pollutant emissions are carefully examined. The results show that the ethanol can be steadily burned to provide heat output between 0.7 and 2.5\u202fkW. Generally a blue flame is obtained, and the NOx and CO concentrations are ultralow. By increasing ethanol flow rate to exceed 8\u202fmL/min, an unsteady, sooting flame is observed owing to incomplete evaporation and poor mixing. A parametric study is conducted to evaluate the influences of liquid tank position, flow rate and tip structure on the combustion characteristics. Additionally, an optimal operation condition is proposed. The current study provides a promising method to burn low-boiling liquid fuel in a clean, efficient and compact way.",

     "abstract": "Radiation is the dominant mode of heat transfer near the burner of coal and biomass-fired boilers. Predicting and measuring heat transfer is critical to the design and operation of new boiler concepts. The individual contributions of gas and particle phases are dependent on gas and particle concentration, particle size, and gas and particle temperature which vary with location relative to the flame. A method for measuring the contributions of both gas and particle radiation capable of being applied in harsh high temperature and pressure environments has been demonstrated using emission from particles and water vapor using an optical fiber probe transmitting a signal to a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The method was demonstrated in four environments of varying gas and particle loading using natural gas and pulverized wood flames in a down-fired 130\u202fkWth cylindrical reactor. The method generates a gas and particle temperature, gas concentrations (H2O and CO2), total gas and particle intensities, and gas and particle total effective emissivity from line-of-sight emission measurements. For the conditions measured, downstream of the luminous flame zone, water vapor and CO2 radiation were the dominant modes of heat transfer (effective emissivity 0.13\u20130.19) with particles making a minor contribution (effective emissivity 0.01\u20130.02). Within a lean natural gas flame, soot emission was low (effective emissivity 0.02) compared to gas (0.14) but within a luminous flame of burning wood particles (500\u202f\u00b5m mean diameter) the particles (soot and burning wood) produced a higher effective emissivity (0.17) than the gas (0.12). The measurement technique was therefore found to be effective for several types of combustion environments.",

     "abstract": "This paper reports a systematic study on the formation of particulate matter with diameter of <10\u00a0\u00b5m (i.e., PM10) during the combustion of two formulated water-soluble fractions (FWSFs) of bio-oil in a drop-tube-furnace (DTF) at 1400\u00a0\u00b0C under air or oxyfuel (30%O2/70%CO2) conditions. FWSF-1 was an organic-free calcium chloride solution with a calcium concentration similar to that in the bio-oil. FWSF-2 was formulated from the compositions of major organics in bio-oil WSF, doped with calcium chloride at the same concentration. The results suggest that similar to bio-oil combustion, the FWSF combustion produces mainly particulate matter with diameter of between 0.1 and 10\u00a0\u00b5m (i.e., PM0.1\u201310). Since there are no combustibles in the organic-free FWSF-1, the PM is produced via droplet evaporation followed by crystallization, fusion and further reactions to form CaO (in air or argon) or partially CaCO3 (under oxyfuel condition). With the addition of organics, FWSF-2 combustion produces PM10 shifting to smaller sizes due to extensive break up of droplets via microexplosion. Sprays with larger droplet size produce PM10 with increased sizes. The results show that upon cooling CaO produced during combustion in air can react with HCl gas to form CaCl2 in PM0.1. The predicted PSDs of PM10 based on the assumption that one droplet produces one PM particle is considerably larger than experimentally-measured PSDs of PM10 during the combustion of FWSFs, confirming that breakup of spray droplets takes place and such breakup is extensive for FWSF-2 when organics are present in the fuel.",

CLC of gaseous fuels has successfully been demonstrated in several pilots up to 150\u00a0kWth. Numerous oxygen carriers have been tested regarding fuel conversion performance and lifetime. This work is a scale-up study of gaseous fuel CLC to MWth scale. A Ca-Mn-based oxygen carrier has been developed and manufactured in ton-scale prior to the present test. Investigations were conducted in a 1\u00a0MWth CLC unit that was adapted to utilize natural gas as fuel. Stable CLC conditions were reached during tests with Ca-Mn-based material, and the transition to operation with ilmenite was studied. The fuel conversion was in the range of 80%. During operation, 99% of the unburned methane was converted in the post oxidation chamber. The solids circulation rate and the lifetime of solids were determined by means of solids samples from the process, which were investigated in terms of attrition and degree of oxidation. The solids circulation rate was 17\u00a0tons\u00a0h\u22121\u00a0 MW\u22121 which is higher than in former tests but lower compared to other units. The most important limiting factors of the fuel conversion are the low solids inventory of the fuel reactor and the oxygen carrier to fuel ratio that corresponds to the solids circulation.",

     "abstract": "Chemical-Looping Combustion (CLC) is a promising technology for performing CO2 capture in combustion processes at low cost and with lower energy consumption. Fuel conversion modelling assists in optimizing and predicting the performance of the CLC process under different operating conditions. For this work, the combustion of natural gas was modelled using a CaMnO3-type perovskite as oxygen-carrier and taking into consideration the processes of fluid dynamics and reaction kinetics involved in fuel conversion. The CLC model was validated against experimental results obtained from the 120\u202fkWth CLC unit at the Vienna University of Technology (TUV). Good agreement between experimental and model predictions of fuel conversion was found when the temperature, pressure drop, solids circulation rate and fuel flow were varied. Model predictions showed that oxygen transfer by means of the gas\u2013solid reaction of the fuel with the oxygen-carrier was relevant throughout the entire fuel-reactor. However, complete combustion could be only achieved under operating conditions where the process of Chemical-Looping assisted by Oxygen Uncoupling (CLaOU) became dominant, i.e. a relevant fraction of the fuel was burnt with molecular oxygen (O2) released by the oxygen-carrier. This phenomenon was improved by the design configuration of the 120\u202fkWth CLC unit at TUV, in which oxidized particles are recirculated to the upper part of the fuel-reactor. Thus, the validated model identified the conditions at which complete combustion can be achieved, demonstrating that it is a powerful tool for the simulation and optimization of the CLC process with the CaMnO3-type material.",

     "abstract": "In chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling, oxygen carrier (OC) circulates between the fuel and air reactors to release and absorb O2 repeatedly. In order to assess the re-oxidation characteristic of Cu-based OC in the air reactor from the microscopic mechanism and macroscopic kinetics perspective, DFT calculations and isothermal oxidation experiments were conducted. In DFT calculations, Cu2O(111) surface was chosen as the objective surface to explore the oxygen uptake as well as the atomic transportation pathways, and to determine the rate-limiting steps basing on the energy barrier analyses. It was found that the energy barrier of the surface reaction step (0.96\u202feV) is smaller than that of the ions diffusion step (1.61\u202feV). Moreover, the Cu cations outward diffusion occurs more easily than O anions inward diffusion, which confirmed the epitaxial growth characteristic of Cu2O oxidation. The isothermal oxidation experiments were conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and about 3.5\u202fmg CuO@TiO2-Al2O3 particles within the diameter range of 75\u2013110\u202f\u00b5m were tested between 540 and 600\u00a0\u00b0C, where the internal and external gas diffusion effects were eliminated. Mixtures of 5.2-21.0\u202fvol.% O2 in N2 were adopted as the gas agent for oxidation. Based on the understandings obtained from DFT calculations, a simple mathematical model with unknown parameters of the surface reaction process (mainly the activation energy, Ek) and ions diffusion process (mainly the activation energy, ED) was established to describe the overall oxidation process in TGA experiments. Eventually, these unknown parameters were determined as Ek=\u202f50.5\u202fkJ/mol and Ek=\u202f79.2\u202fkJ/mol via global optimization. With the attained parameters, simulations reproduced the experimental results very well, which demonstrated that this simplification model, where grain is converted almost layer by layer but different from the feature of the shrinking core model is able to accurately describe the overall oxidation process of Cu2O.",

     "abstract": "The effect of steam and sulphur dioxide on CO2 capture by limestone during calcium looping was studied in a novel lab-scale twin fluidised bed device (Twin Beds \u2013 TB). The apparatus consists of two interconnected batch fluidised bed reactors which are connected to each other by a duct permitting a rapid and complete pneumatic transport of the sorbent (limestone) between the reactors. Tests were carried out under typical calcium looping operating conditions with or without the presence of H2O and/or SO2 during the carbonation stage. Carbonation was carried out at 650\u00b0C in presence of 15% CO2, 10% steam (when present) and by investigating two SO2 levels, representative of either raw (1500\u202fppm) or pre-desulphurised (75\u202fppm) typical flue gas derived from coal combustion. The sorbent used was a reactive German limestone. Its performance was evaluated in terms of CO2 capture capacity, sulphur uptake, attrition and fragmentation. Results demonstrated the beneficial effect of H2O and the detrimental effect of SO2 on the CO2 capture capacity. When both species were simultaneously present in the gas, steam was still able to enhance the CO2 capture capacity even outweighing the negative effect of SO2 at low SO2 concentrations. A clear relationship between degrees of Ca carbonation and sulphation was observed. As regards the mechanical properties of the sorbent, both H2O and SO2 hardened the particle surface inducing a decrease of the measured attrition rate, that was indeed always very low. Conversely, the fragmentation tendency increased in presence of H2O and SO2 most likely due to the augmented internal stresses within the particles. Clear bimodal particle size distributions for in-bed sorbent fragments were observed. Microstructural scanning electron microscope and porosimetric characterisations aided in explaining the observed trends.",

     "abstract": "Conventional air incineration of plastic waste has been considered as one of important sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) through de novo synthesis and precursor conversion. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an attractive technology for the conversion of plastic wastes to energy with the potential to drastically suppress the formation of PCDD/Fs. In this paper, the iG-CLC (in-situ gasification CLC) experiments of plastic waste were implemented in a semi-continuously operated fluidized bed reactor, which actually simulates the fuel reactor of a continuously-operated interconnected fluidized bed reactor. A kind of low-cost material, natural iron ore without/with 5\u00a0wt% CaO adsorbent through the ultrasonic impregnation method, was used as oxygen carrier (OC). Firstly, some key performances of the reactor system, such as the relevance of the bed inventory to the flow rate of fluidizing agent as well as the relationship between the feeding rate and overflow rate of OC, were calibrated. Then, 90\u00a0min of single experiment was conducted for each experimental case and an accumulative operation of more than 10\u00a0h was attained. Typically, the combustion efficiency can reach at about 98%, and both the carbon conversion and CO2 yield can approach to 95% at 900\u00a0\u00b0C and input thermal power of 150\u00a0W with a mixture of 5\u00a0vol% H2O and 95\u00a0vol% N2 as the fluidizing agent (UFR/Umf\u00a0=\u00a03). Moreover, the results obtained in the semi-continuously operated fluidized bed reactor demonstrated that CaO decoration to iron ore is conductive to suppressing the formation of chlorobenzene (as a toxic matter and precursor/intermediate of PCDD/Fs) and does not obviously deteriorate the OC performance.",

     "abstract": "Spinel CuFe2O4 is a promising oxygen carrier due to its synergistic enhanced performance. A fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism between oxygen carrier and fuels is important for a rational design of highly efficient oxygen carrier. The reaction mechanism of spinel CuFe2O4 with CO during chemical-looping combustion (CLC) was studied based on thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Two distinct reaction stages were clearly observed. CuFe2O4 was mainly transformed into Cu and Fe3O4 with a rapid reaction rate in the initial stage, and then product Fe3O4 was slowly reduced to FeO or even to Fe. The reactivity of CuFe2O4 is much higher than that of Fe2O3, which is ascribed to the existence of Cu. The enhanced oxygen evolution activity of CuFe2O4 at low temperature is validated by both the experimental and theoretical methods. Three types of surface oxygen coordinated with different metal atoms show different reactivity. Two kinds of reaction pathways are involved in CO oxidation over CuFe2O4. In the one-step reaction pathway, CO directly reacts with the oxygen bonding to two octahedral Cu and one octahedral Fe atoms to form a CO2 molecule without an energy barrier, which corresponds to the surface oxygen consumption observed in TGA experiments. In the possible two-step reaction pathway, CO first adsorbs on the surface, and then reacts with the oxygen bound to one octahedral Cu and two octahedral Fe atoms to generate CO2 by surmounting an energy barrier of 10.84 kJ/mol, which is the most kinetically and thermodynamically favorable pathway.",

The coupled ash-deposition and wall heat-transfer model is implemented into a large-eddy simulation (LES) framework to predict the heat-flux profile, deposition rates, slagging and fouling for industrial boilers. The results of this approach are validated with experimental data from the University of Utah\u2019s 100\u00a0kW down-fired, oxy-fuel combustion (OFC) furnace. Two OFC cases with different geometries are studied for their coal combustion and dynamic ash-deposit growth in this large-scale laboratory furnace.

The modeling work is of relevance to experiments in a 25\u202fkW self-sustained down-fired furnace, which provides a sequence of real deposit shapes as varied boundary conditions for CFD simulations. Although the formed ash deposit has a comparable length scale with the probe, it has little effect on the global impaction efficiency of newly-coming particles. However, as the deposit builds up, incident particles impact the deposit and probe at generally larger impact angles and smaller normal velocities despite the almost invariant global impaction efficiency. It results in an enhanced local sticking probability in the center region of the probe, but a decreased one in the lateral regions. The incident kinetic energy of newly sticking particles to the deposit exhibits a converse correlation with their impact angle. The relationship of the averaged local sticking probability as a function of the azimuthal angle of probe is illustrated. Finally, the effect of Reynolds number on global particle impaction efficiency is examined. A universal formula is proposed, which is of importance to bridge lab-scale experiments and practical applications.",

     "abstract": "Particle deposition on heat exchanger tubes is a serious concern in solid fuel combustion and gasification systems, such as power plants and syngas coolers. To predict deposition rates, several detailed computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models have been developed. However, these models are computationally expensive and cannot be used for quick determination of deposition rates and/or slagging tendencies. Particle impaction efficiency correlations, while not as accurate as detailed CFD models, are easier to use and are able to estimate the impaction rate of particles on the heat exchanger tubes. Nonetheless, since deposition and slagging are not just functions of particle impaction rates, but also sticking propensity, which is related to the particle temperature at impact, the impaction efficiency correlations fail to provide sufficient information. To address this shortcoming, similar correlations for particle temperature at impact have been developed in this work, based on a non-dimensional parameter that captures the flow and boundary conditions, as well as particle properties. When used alongside the impaction efficiency correlations, the new correlations developed can provide a reasonable estimate of the deposition and slagging tendencies, at negligible computational expense.",

     "abstract": "The release of arsenic vapors (As3+) during high-arsenic coal combustion not only raises serious environmental concerns, but also causes catalyst deactivation in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. To illuminate the mechanisms involved in the transformation of arsenic vapors towards less troublesome arsenates (As5+) during coal combustion, the accessory minerals in the high-arsenic coal were identified and the association relationship of these compounds with arsenic in fly ash was estimated. The results showed that Si/Al were the main inorganic elements in high-arsenic coal while the content of Ca was quite low. Ca was mostly transformed into sulfates during coal combustion and the effect of Ca on the arsenic transformation was limited. Al/Fe played a more significant role in arsenic speciation transformation and arsenic in the fly ash was predominantly bound with Al/Fe-oxides as arsenates. It was further confirmed that Al in kaolin/metakaolin showed good capacity on arsenic capture. In addition, few arsenic vapors were captured through the physical adsorption mechanism and the large fraction of As3+ in some fine particles was mostly attributed to the chemical reactions between arsenic vapors and Al-compounds. Meanwhile, a certain amount of arsenic vapors were converted into As2O5(s) under the influence of SCR catalyst and then carried by flue gas to participate in fly ash. Besides, part of arsenic distributed in the fly ash was through the stabilization of ash matrix in high temperature conditions. The transformation of arsenic from vapors towards particulate arsenic favored arsenic emission control by particulate matter control devices.",

     "abstract": "O2/H2O combustion, as a new evolution of oxy-fuel combustion, has gradually gained more attention recently for carbon capture in a coal-fired power plant. The physical and chemical properties of steam e.g. reactivity, thermal capacity, diffusivity, can affect the coal combustion process. In this work, the ignition and volatile combustion characteristics of a single lignite particle were first investigated in a fluidized bed combustor under O2/H2O atmosphere. The flame and particle temperatures were measured by a calibrated two-color pyrometry and pre-buried thermocouple, respectively. Results indicated that the volatile flame became smaller and brighter as the oxygen concentration increased. The ignition delay time of particle in dense phase was shorter than that in dilute phase due to its higher heat transfer coefficient. Also, the volatile flame was completely separated from particles (defined as off-flame) in dense phase while the flame lay on the particle surface (defined as on-flame) in dilute phase. The self-heating of fuel particles by on-flame in dilute phase was more obvious than that in dense phase, leading to earlier char combustion. At low oxygen concentration, the flame in the H2O atmosphere was darker than that in the N2 atmosphere because the heat capacity of H2O is higher than that of N2. With the increase of oxygen concentration, the flame temperature in the O2/H2O atmosphere was dramatically enhanced rather than that in the O2/N2 atmosphere, where the diffusion rate of oxygen in O2/N2 atmosphere became the dominant factor.",

     "abstract": "For stationary power sources such as utility boilers, it is useful to dispose of parametric models able to describe their behavior in a wide range of operating conditions, to predict some Quantities of Interest (QOIs) that need to be consistent with experimental observations. The development of predictive simulation tools for large scale systems cannot rely on full-order models, as the latter would lead to prohibitive costs when coupled to sampling techniques in the model parameter space. An alternative approach consists of using a Surrogate Model (SM). As the number of QOIs is often high and many SMs need to be trained, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to encode the set of QOIs in a much smaller set of scalars, called PCA scores. A SM is then built for each PCA score rather than for each QOI. The advantage of reducing the number of variables is twofold: computational costs are reduced (less SMs need to be trained) and information is preserved (correlation among the original variables).The strategy is applied to a CFD model simulating the Alstom 15 MWth oxy-pilot Boiler Simulation Facility (BSF). In practice, experiments cannot provide full coverage of the pulverized-coal utility boiler due to both practicality and costs. Values of the model\u2019s parameters which guarantee consistency with the experimental data of this test facility for 121 QOIs are found, by training a SM based on the combination of Kriging and PCA, using only 5 latent variables.",

Experiments were carried out in a small scale down-fired cylindrical combustion chamber equipped with an annular swirl burner. Studied flames had a constant power output of 40\u00a0kWth and O2/CO2 oxidizer gas mixtures with O2 concentrations ranging from 23 to 33\u00a0vol%. Detailed two-dimensional flow field measurements are obtained from laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). Velocity profiles (Mean and RMS) have been obtained for all conditions investigated and serve as basis for identification of flow field characteristics. Velocity RMS values are provided as supplementary material. To complement flow field measurements, in-flame gas composition measurements were also conducted using a sampling probe combined with infrared gas absorption analysis via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. The results obtained show increased velocities, particularly along the main vortex for flames with increased oxygen contents, while lower velocities are found to occur inside the recirculation regions. The opposite occurs with lower O2 concentrations, showing significantly reduced velocities in the main vortex, but stronger recirculation than the high oxygen counterparts. This effect is attributed to a modification of the swirl level introduced by the expansion of product gases. Measured NO and CO in-flame concentrations showed significant variations under different O2 concentrations in the oxidizer.",

However, no work has been reported regarding the impacts on such interactions of CO2, the dominant component in the oxy\u2013fuel combustion gas. This was investigated in the present work by using mixtures of pyrite and kaolinite, a prevailing silicate mineral in coal. Furthermore, the sintering strength of the generated products was also evaluated. The pyrite\u2013kaolinite mixtures were treated on a fixed bed reactor in both N2 and CO2 for comparison. The treating temperature was 1050, 1150 and 1250\u00a0\u00b0C while the reaction time was 3, 6 and 12\u00a0min, respectively. The solid products were characterized by techniques such as X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Sintering tests of these products were carried out as well. It was found that some interactions between pyrite and kaolinite took place in the N2 atmosphere. This was evidenced by the formation of iron aluminosilicate and attributed to the effects of water vapor released from kaolinite dehydroxylation. Nevertheless, pyrite\u2013kaolinite interactions in N2 were limited and had insignificant effects on product sintering strength development. In CO2, pyrite\u2013kaolinite interactions were significantly enhanced, compared with those in N2. Although the kaolinite-derived water vapor had some effects, CO2 was found to play a dominant role. Enhanced pyrite\u2013kaolinite interactions resulted in an increase of eutectic phases. Consequently, the product sintering strength development was greatly elevated. It was further found that, under the conditions investigated, the interactions between pyrite and kaolinite were actually through reactions between FeO, rather than other intermediates, and aluminosilicate. This new finding enabled us to develop the mechanisms for pyrite\u2013kaolinite interactions in N2 and CO2.",

Specifically, two cases with different levels of oxygen in the coflow stream, namely HM1 and HM3, are simulated to reveal the differences between MILD and hot-temperature combustion. The TPDF simulation well predicts the temperature and species distributions including those of OH, CO and NO for both cases with a 25-species mechanism. The reduced reaction activity in HM1 as reflected in the peak OH concentration is well correlated to the reduced oxygen in the coflow stream. The particle-level local sensitivities with respect to mixing and chemical reaction further show dramatic differences in the flame characteristics. HM1 is less sensitive to mixing and reaction parameters than HM3 due to the suppressed combustion process. Specifically, for HM1 the sensitivities to mixing and chemical reactions have comparable magnitude, indicating that the combustion progress is controlled by both mixing and reaction in MILD combustion. For HM3, there is however a change in the combustion mode: during the flame initialization, the combustion progress is more sensitive to chemical reactions, indicating that finite-rate chemistry is the controlling process during the autoignition process for flame stabilization; at further downstream where the flame has established, the combustion progress is controlled by mixing, which is characteristic of nonpremixed flames. An examination of the particles with the largest sensitivities reveals the difference in the controlling mixtures for flame stabilization, namely, the stoichiometric mixtures are important for HM1, whereas, fuel-lean mixtures are controlling for HM3. The study demonstrates the potential of TPDF simulations with sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of finite-rate chemistry on the flame characteristics and emissions, and reveal the controlling physio-chemical processes in MILD combustion.",

Reasonable agreement between experimental and numerical investigations, however, requires finite-rate chemistry models and, often, ad hoc model adjustment. To remedy this, an adaptive eddy dissipation concept (EDC) combustion model has previously been developed to target conditions encountered in MILD combustion; however, this model relies on a simplified, pre-defined assumption about the combustion chemistry. The present paper reports a generalised version of the modified EDC model without the need for an assumed, single-step chemical reaction or ad hoc coefficient tuning. The results show good agreement with experimental measurements of two CH4/H2 flames in hot coflows, showing improvements over the standard EDC model as well as the previously published modified EDC model. The updated version of the EDC model also demonstrates the capacity to reproduce the downstream transition in flame structure of a MILD jet flame seen experimentally, but which has previously proven challenging to capture computationally. Analyses of the previously identified dominant heat-release reactions provide insight into the structural differences between a conventional autoignitive flame and a flame in the MILD combustion regime, whilst highlighting the requirement for a generalised EDC combustion model.",

     "abstract": "The strategy to stabilize distributed combustion regimes adopting cyclonic flow fields has been proven to be challenging. In fact, the establishment of a toroidal flow field within a combustion chamber may ensure the recirculation of mass and sensible enthalpy required to simultaneously dilute the fresh reactants and increase the temperature above the autoignition one. The combination of reactants dilution and preheating may greatly increase system energy efficiency and lower pollutants production producing very peculiar combustion regime (named MILD Combustion). At the same time this strategy can be compromised if the sensible enthalpy is not high enough to promote the auto-ignition process of diluted mixtures. This may happen either because of an inefficient recirculation system or due to a too low calorific fuel. The paper aims at exploiting the performance of a small-size cyclonic burner for a conventional fuel (CH4) and a low calorific fuel (synthetic biogas) through the characterization of the process stabilization and pollutant emissions as a function of the mixture equivalence ratio and the nominal thermal power of the inlet mixture (from 2 to 10\u202fkW), with the aim of identifying the optimal operating condition of the system. Results suggest that the system has to be exercised with mixtures with compositions slightly under the stoichiometric conditions and in a well identified temperature range to minimize both NOx and CO emission. The burner can be easily exercised also with low calorific fuels for higher thermal powers according to the low LHV. However, it results that an efficient recirculation of the exhausts produces a robust MILD combustion condition also when low calorific fuels are used.",

The central methane fuel stream is diluted with N2, CO2 or He. The annular air stream is enriched with oxygen and can be impregnated with swirl. Former studies have shown that the stoichiometric mixing length of relatively short flames is controlled by the mixing process taking place in the vicinity of the injector outlet. This property has been used to derive scaling laws at large values of the stoichiometric mixture fraction. It is shown here that the same relation can be extended to methane oxy-flames characterized by small values of the stoichiometric mixture fraction. Flame lengths are determined with OH* chemiluminescence measurements over more than 1000 combinations of momentum ratio, annular swirl level and composition of the inner and outer streams of the coaxial injector. It is found that the lengths of all the flames investigated without swirl collapse on a single line, whose coefficients correspond to within 15% of flame lengths obtained for fuel and oxidizer streams at much larger stoichiometric mixture fractions. This relation is then extended to the case of swirling flames by including the contribution of the tangential velocity in the flow entrainment rate and is found to well reproduce the mixing degree of the two co-axial streams as long as the flow does not exhibit a vortex breakdown bubble. At higher swirl levels, when the flow features a central recirculation region, the flame length is found to also directly depend on the oxygen enrichment in the oxidizer stream.",

Improvements in efficiency may be realized by significantly reducing the recycle flue gas (RFG), however, in application, care must be taken to avoid excessive radiant heat flux and gas temperature. One of the features oxy-combustion, unlike air-fired combustion, is that the oxygen and dilution gases are initially separated. RFG can, for example, be strategically blended with either the fuel stream, or oxidizer stream, or both, which affects the stoichiometric mixture fraction, Zst. In this work, the effects of the amount of dilution, or RFG, and Zst on soot fraction are experimentally investigated in a laminar coflow flame. Carbon dioxide is employed as the dilution gas to simulate the recycling of dry flue gas. Soot fraction and temperature are quantitatively determined by a flame image processing technique. In addition, the visible and near-IR emission spectra are given. When dilution, or RFG, is reduced, while holding Zst constant, soot formation and thermal radiation increase due to higher temperature. However, high temperature flames with reduced or zero soot are achieved by increasing Zst via the combination of fuel dilution and oxygen enrichment. This study highlights the inherent flexibility of oxy-fuel combustion, which offers the opportunity to control flame temperature and gas volume while independently controlling soot formation and radiant heat transfer.",

     "abstract": "Two key flame macrostructures in swirling flows have been observed in experiments of oxy-combustion (as well as air-combustion); as the equivalence ratio is raised, the flame moves from being stabilized on just the inner shear layer (Flame III) to getting stabilized on both the inner and outer shear layers (Flame IV). We report results of an LES investigation of two different inlet oxy-fuel mixtures, in a turbulent swirling flow at Re = 20 , 000 , that capture these two macrostructures. Previous work on the effects of heat loss have mostly focused on its impact on macro-scale observations. In this paper, we examine how heat loss impacts the flame microstructures as well for these two macrostructures. For both flames, the flamelet structure, as represented by a scatter plot of the normalized fuel concentration against the normalized temperature, depends on whether the combustor walls are adiabatic or non-adiabatic. For the adiabatic case, the flamelets of both macrostructures behave like strained flames. When wall heat transfer is included, Flame III microstructure is more bimodal. Since this flame extends farther downstream and part of it propagates along the walls, heat transfer has a greater impact on it\u2019s microstructure. These results show that heat loss impacts not just the macro properties of the flame such as its shape or interactions with the wall, but also fundamentally changes its internal structure. Scatter plots of the turbulent flames are constructed and compared to different 1D laminar flame profiles (e.g., strained or with heat loss), and comparisons suggest the important role of the wall thermal boundary conditions in the accurate simulations of combustion dynamics and interpretations of experimental data, including data reduction and scaling.",

Considering a previously performed numerical analysis, which proved that the NO reduction level depends on the equivalence ratio of the primary combustion zone in a NH3-air swirl burner, an experimental study using a combustor test rig was carried out. Results showed that eliminating air flow through primary dilution holes moves the point of the lowest NO emissions to the lesser fuel flow rate. Based on findings derived by using a test rig, a rich-lean low NOx combustor was newly manufactured for actual gas-turbine operations. As a result, the NH3 single fueled low-NOx combustion gas-turbine power generation using the rich-lean combustion concept succeeded over a wide range of power and rotational speeds, i.e., below 10\u201340 kWe and 75,000\u201380,000\u202frpm, respectively.

However, achievement of low NOx emission from ammonia combustors remains an important challenge. In this study, combustion techniques and combustor design for efficient combustion and low NOx emission from an ammonia MGT swirl combustor are proposed. The effects of fuel injection angle, combustor inlet temperature, equivalence ratio, and ambient pressure on flame stabilization and emissions were investigated in a laboratory high pressure combustion chamber. An FTIR gas analyser was employed in analysing the exhaust gases. Numerical modeling using OpenFOAM was done to better understand the dependence of NO emissions on the equivalence ratio. The result show that inclined fuel injection as opposed to vertical injection along the combustor central axis resulted to improved flame stability, and lower NH3 and NOx emissions. Numerical and experimental results showed that a control of the equivalence ratio upstream of the combustor is critical for low NOx emission in a rich-lean ammonia combustor. NO emission had a minimum value at an upstream equivalence ratio of 1.10 in the experiments. Furthermore, NO emission was found to decrease with ambient pressure, especially for premixed combustion. For the rich-lean combustion strategy employed in this study, lower NOx emission was recorded in premixed combustion than in non-premixed combustion indicating the importance of mixture uniformity for low NOx emission from ammonia combustion. A prototype liner developed to enhance the control and uniformity of the equivalence ratio upstream of the combustor further improved ammonia combustion. With the proposed liner design, NOx emission of 42\u202fppmv and ammonia combustion efficiency of 99.5% were achieved at 0.3\u202fMPa for fuel input power of 31.44\u202fkW.",

This paper focuses on the iron ore sintering, a thermal agglomeration process in steel mills. The results from a detailed experimental study of the pilot-scale pot tests under the conditions of a wide range of fuel rate are presented. The primary objective is to provide better understanding of the growth of gas channels relating to melt formation in the flame front and its resistance to flow. The sintering bed was divided into several zones based on the temperature profile and component distribution. Even though there is a continuous one-to-one replacement of humidified zone with porous sintered zone, a constant air flow rate during sintering could be obtained, indicating the \u223c100\u202fmm high-temperature zone has a controlling effect on sintering bed permeability. The specific pressure drop value in high-temperature zone increases from \u223c3\u202fkPa in upper bed to \u223c7\u202fkPa in bottom bed, which varies with the bed temperature and structure properties. Both the green bed and sintered bed were scanned by X-ray computed tomography, the reconstruction and image analysis showed that the sintered bed has large gas channels and many more closed pores due to solid-melt-gas coalescence. More melt is generated when the heat is accumulated along the bed or input higher coke content, showing a propensity to suppress the gas channel growth and amplify the mismatch of gas transportation along the bed. Higher coke rate leads to a higher resistance in flame front, resulting in a slower flame front speed. These results are aimed to provide quantitative validation for improvements of a numerical sintering model in a future work.",

Detailed radiation modeling using sophisticated tools like photon Monte Carlo/line-by-line (PMC/LBL) is computationally expensive. Here, guided by results from PMC/LBL, a simplified stepwise-gray spectral model in combination with a first-order spherical harmonics (P1 method) radiative transfer equation (RTE) solver is proposed and tested for engine-relevant conditions. Radiative emission, reabsorption and radiation reaching the walls are computed for a heavy-duty compression-ignition engine at part-load and full-load operating conditions with different levels of EGR and soot.

The results show that the proposed P1/StepwiseGray model can calculate reabsorption locally and globally with less than 10% error (with respect to PMC/LBL) at a small fraction of the computational cost of PMC/LBL (a factor of 30) and P1/FSK (a factor of 15). In contrast, error in computed reabsorption by the P1/Gray model is as high as 60%. It is expected that the simplified model should be broadly applicable to high-pressure hydrocarbon\u2013air combustion systems, with or without soot.",

     "abstract": "Pilot-ignited dual fuel combustion involves a complex transition between the pilot fuel autoignition and the premixed-like phase of combustion, which is challenging for experimental measurement and numerical modelling, and not sufficiently explored. To further understand the fundamentals of the dual fuel ignition processes, the transient ignition and subsequent flame development in a turbulent dimethyl ether (DME)/methane-air mixing layer under diesel engine-relevant conditions are studied by direct numerical simulations (DNS). Results indicate that combustion is initiated by a two-stage autoignition that involves both low-temperature and high-temperature chemistry. The first stage autoignition is initiated at the stoichiometric mixture, and then the ignition front propagates against the mixture fraction gradient into rich mixtures and eventually forms a diffusively-supported cool flame. The second stage ignition kernels are spatially distributed around the most reactive mixture fraction with a low scalar dissipation rate. Multiple triple flames are established and propagate along the stoichiometric mixture, which is proven to play an essential role in the flame developing process. The edge flames gradually get close to each other with their branches eventually connected. It is the leading lean premixed branch that initiates the steady propagating methane-air flame. The time required for the initiation of steady flame is substantially shorter than the autoignition delay time of the methane-air mixture under the same thermochemical condition. Temporal evolution of the displacement speed at the flame front is also investigated to clarify the propagation characteristics of the combustion waves. Cool flame and propagation of triple flames are also identified in this study, which are novel features of the pilot-ignited dual fuel combustion.",

     "abstract": "Furan and its derivatives have been receiving attention as next generation alternative fuels, related to advanced bio-oil production. However, the ignition quality of furans allows their use only as an additive to diesel fuel in CI engines, which potentially requires the continued use of a fossil-derived base fuel. This study first adopts tri-propylene glycol mono-methyl ether (TPGME) as a substitute for diesel fuel with addition of furan and furan derivatives, including 2-methylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran, and furfural, thereby removing fossil-derived fuels from the mixture. With this motivation, gas-phase ignition characteristics of furans were investigated in a modified CFR motored engine, displaying an absence of low temperature heat release (LTHR), while n-heptane as a reference fuel shows a strong two-stage ignition characteristic under the same condition. The structural impact of furans is represented as global oxidation reactivities that are as follows: furan\u202f<\u202f2-methylfuran\u202f<\u202f2,5-dimethylfuran\u202f<\u202ffurfural\u202f<\u202fn-heptane. The ranking of individual furans is supported by bond dissociation energies of each fuel's functional group substituent on the furan-ring. Ignition characteristics of TPGME display a strong low-temperature oxidation reactivity; however, its reactivity rapidly diminishes with increasing amounts of furan, shutting down low-temperature oxidation paths. The structural impact of furan and methyl-substituted furans on reactivity is significantly muted when blended with TPGME, as observed in a motored CFR engine and a constant volume spray combustion chamber.",

Measurements separately assess the effects of calcium- and magnesium-based detergent additive fraction, oil viscosity, oil degradation, and base oil classification on mixture ignition propensity at conditions with relevance to low speed pre-ignition (LSPI) in gasoline engines. Testing of 0\u201325% (by mass) oil blended into a six-component surrogate mixture representing an unleaded \u201caverage\u201d European gasoline blend is used to determine sensitivity of DCN responses to variations in the properties. With one exception, mixture DCNs were found to increase with lubricating oil content. Despite variation in calcium and magnesium concentrations, DCN responses for all oil blends indicate no statistically significant effect of either calcium or magnesium. Similarly, neither aging of nor peroxide addition to the oil yields significant DCN changes compared to untreated oils. However, a distinct response is found for variations in the base lubricant chemical structural properties. At 25% oil blending with gasoline surrogate, the measured DCNs (RONs) of different group base oils range from 19.6 (95.7) to 42.1 (46.2). The DCN increases with increasing base oil API Group Number (I through IV); however, mixture DCN was found to decrease for a 25% blend of Group V-B with the gasoline surrogate. Using quantitative 1H NMR, the Group Number trend is interpreted to be a consequence of linear vs. branched character of the paraffinic base oil composition. Taken together, the present results indicate that at ASTM D6890 DCN test conditions, there is no significant ignition effect attributable to reasonable variations in the lubricant's calcium or magnesium content, viscosity, or degree of degradation. Instead, the isomeric character of the paraffinic base oil appears to be most significant in controlling lubricant autoignition properties relative to those of gasolines.",

The conditions correspond to a parametric variation of the Engine Combustion Network Spray A (pressure 60 atm; oxidizer oxygen level and temperature 21% and 900\u00a0K, respectively; fuel temperature 363\u00a0K). Three simulations with equivalence ratios of 3, 5, and 7 are performed with a Karlovitz number (Ka, based on flame time) of order 100 to match the estimated Ka of the rich premixed combustion region in Spray A. At these conditions, the reference laminar flames exhibit a complex structure which involves both low-temperature chemistry (LTC) and high-temperature chemistry over a wide range of length scales. In the presence of turbulence, the flame structure is strongly affected in physical space and the reaction zone exhibits a very complex structure in which broken, distributed, and thin regions co-exist, especially for the leanest case. However, the contribution of the LTC pathway is only weakly affected by turbulence. In progress variable space, the mean flame structure, including the chemical source terms, is found to match remarkably well that of the corresponding unity Lewis number laminar flame, particularly for the \u03d5 = 3 and 5 cases. This behavior is attributed to the strong turbulent mixing occurring throughout the flames/reaction zones, which suppresses differential diffusion effects. Nevertheless, large conditional fluctuations around the mean chemical source terms are identified. These are found to correlate very well with radical species mass fractions such as OH. In addition, a similar functional dependence is obtained from counterflow laminar flames. As such, it appears from these results that laminar flame models have a potential to be used to represent the thermochemical state of rich premixed turbulent flames under diesel engine conditions.",

     "abstract": "Surrogate fuels aim to reproduce real fuel combustion characteristics in order to enable predictive simulations and fuel/engine design. In this work, surrogate mixtures were formulated for three diesel fuels (Coryton Euro and Coryton US-2D certification grade and Saudi pump grade) and two jet fuels (POSF 4658 and POSF 4734) using the minimalist functional group (MFG) approach, a method recently developed and tested for gasoline fuels. The diesel and jet fuel surrogates were formulated by matching five important functional groups, while minimizing the surrogate components to two species. Another molecular parameter, called as branching index (BI), which denotes the degree of branching was also used as a matching criterion. The present works aims to test the ability of the MFG surrogate methodology for high molecular weight fuels (e.g., jet and diesel). 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to analyze the composition of the groups in diesel fuels, and those in jet fuels were evaluated using the molecular data obtained from published literature. The MFG surrogates were experimentally evaluated in an ignition quality tester (IQT), wherein ignition delay times (IDT) and derived cetane number (DCN) were measured. Physical properties, namely, average molecular weight (AMW) and density, and thermochemical properties, namely, heat of combustion and H/C ratio were also compared. The results show that the MFG surrogates were able to reproduce the combustion properties of the above fuels, and we demonstrate that fewer species in surrogates can be as effective as more complex surrogates. We conclude that the MFG approach can radically simplify the surrogate formulation process, significantly reduce the cost and time associated with the development of chemical kinetic models, and facilitate surrogate testing.",

     "abstract": "Usually premixed flame propagation and laminar burning velocity are studied for mixtures at normal or elevated temperatures and pressures, under which the ignition delay time of the premixture is much larger than the flame resistance time. However, in spark-ignition engines and spark-assisted compression ignition engines, the end-gas in the front of premixed flame is at the state that autoignition might happen before the mixture is consumed by the premixed flame. In this study, laminar premixed flames propagating into an autoigniting dimethyl ether/air mixture are simulated considering detailed chemistry and transport. The emphasis is on the laminar burning velocity of autoigniting mixtures under engine-relevant conditions. Two types of premixed flames are considered: one is the premixed planar flame propagating into an autoigniting DME/air without confinement; and the other is premixed spherical flame propagating inside a closed chamber, for which four stages are identified. Due to the confinement, the unburned mixture is compressed to high temperature and pressure close to or under engine-relevant conditions. The laminar burning velocity is determined from the constant-volume propagating spherical flame method as well as PREMIX. The laminar burning velocities of autoigniting DME/air mixture at different temperatures, pressures, and autoignition progresses are obtained. It is shown that the first-stage and second-stage autoignition can significantly accelerate the flame propagation and thereby greatly increase the laminar burning velocity. When the first-stage autoignition occurs in the unburned mixture, the isentropic compression assumption does not hold and thereby the traditional method cannot be used to calculate the laminar burning velocity. A modified method without using the isentropic compression assumption is proposed. It is shown to work well for autoigniting mixtures. Besides, a power law correlation is obtained based on all the laminar burning velocity data. It works well for mixtures before autoignition while improvement is still needed for mixtures after autoignition.",

In this study, the structural impact of nine alkylbenzenes on their ignition characteristics is experimentally and computationally investigated with particular emphasis on the blending effect with significantly more reactive normal alkanes. Experimental comparisons of mono-alkylbenzenes (toluene, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, iso-propylbenzene) from a modified CFR engine showed that the difference in pure alkylbenzene reactivity significantly diminished when blended with n-heptane, as the strength of the radical scavenging effect of all three alkylbenzenes is similar. Among C8H10 isomers, the reactivity of pure ethylbenzene and o-xylene and their blends with n-heptane showed a complex competing effect between the difference in CH bond energy and the existence of intermediate/low-temperature chemistry caused by adjacent methyl pairs. A similar structural impact was also observed for C9H12 isomers and their blends with n-heptane, while the influence of CH bond energy was more noticeable than C8H10 molecules. Kinetic simulations of the alkylbenzene/n-heptane blends highlighted the effect caused by adjacent methyl pairs that is referred to as the \u201cortho effect\u201d. Analysis of ethylbenzene and o-xylene showed that o-xylene's intermediate/low-temperature pathways initiated by benzylperoxy radical \u2013 benzylhydroperoxide isomerization (RO2 \u2013 QOOH) produce additional active radicals such as OH and CH2O, which accelerates the oxidation chemistry of more reactive n-heptane. This study provides knowledge on the blending effect of alkylbenzene compounds with n-heptane on their ignition characteristics that is useful to develop surrogates that can better mimic the reactivity of real fuels.",

To determine the molecules general applicability to a combustion system and to develop up combustion models a rapid screening of the ignition characteristics is performed in a rapid compression machine and a shock tube. Those suggest DEM being a potential fuel for gasoline controlled autoignition (GCAI) because of a relatively wide range of temperature independent ignition delay, a good autoignition behavior compared to conventional gasoline fuel and a multi-stage ignition behavior. To test the suitability of those molecules as a fuel and determine possible improvements to the production side, DEM was used in a single cylinder research engine operated in GCAI combustion mode. Compared to GCAI combustion with conventional RON95\u00a0E10 fuel, DME shows a significantly decreased ignition delay. As a consequence, the internal residual gas fraction, whose enthalpy is used to initiate autoignition, can be reduced and combustion stability is increased. Starting from similar combustion phasing using external exhaust gas recirculation to align the ignition behavior of DEM and RON95\u00a0E10, a variation of the intake temperature reveals that DEM has the potential to reduce the sensitivity of the combustion system.",

Results show that the penetration of the second injection is faster than that of the first injection. More importantly, it is shown that the ignition delay time of the second injection is much shorter than that of the first injection. This is due to the residual effects of the ignition of the first injection which increases the local temperature and maintains a certain level of combustion some intermediates or radical which in turn boosts the ignition of the second injection.",

Two sets of conditions with temperatures within and slightly above the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime are simulated to investigate the fundamental aspects of auto-ignition and flame propagation along with the transition from auto-ignitive deflagration to spontaneous propagation regimes under thermal stratification. Contrary to the standard laminar flame speed, the steady propagation speed of an auto-ignitive front is observed to scale proportionally to its level of upstream reactivity. It is shown that this interdependence is primarily influenced by the characteristic residence time and the homogeneous auto-ignition delay. Furthermore, the unsteady reaction front in either of the two cases responds distinctly to the imposed stratification. Specifically, the results in both cases show that the dynamic flame response depends on the mean temperature at the flame base Tb and the time-scale of thermal stratification. It is also found that, based on Tb and the propensity of the mixture to two-stage chemistry, the instantaneous peak propagation speed and the overall time taken to achieve that speed differs considerably. A displacement speed analysis is carried out to elucidate the underlying combustion modes that are responsible for such a variation in flame response.",

     "abstract": "Increasing energy demands and more stringent legislation relating to pollutants such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) from fossil fuels have accelerated the use of biofuels such as biodiesel. However, current limitations of using biodiesel as an alternative fuel for CI engines include a higher viscosity and higher NOx emissions. This is a major issue that could be improved by blending biodiesel with alcohols. This paper investigates the effect of a butanol\u2013acetone mixture (BA) as an additive blended with biodiesel to improve the latter's properties. Macroscopic spray characteristics (spray penetration, spray cone angle and spray volume) were measured in constant volume vessel (CVV) at two injection pressures. A high-speed camera was used to record spray images. The spray's edge was determined using an automatic threshold calculation algorithm to locate the spray outline (edge) from the binary images. In addition, an engine test was carried out experimentally on a single-cylinder diesel engine. The engine's performance was measured using in-cylinder pressure, brake power (BP) and specific fuel consumption (SFC). Emission characteristics NOx, CO and UHC were also measured. Neat biodiesel and three blends of biodiesel with up to 30% added BA were tested. The experimental data were analyzed via ANOVA to evaluate whether variations in parameters due to the different fuels were significant. The results showed that BA can enhance the spray characteristics of biodiesel by increasing both the spray penetration length and the contact surface area, thereby improving air\u2013fuel mixing. The peak in-cylinder pressure for 30% BA was comparable to neat diesel and higher than that of neat biodiesel. Brake power (BP) was slightly improved for 10% BA at an engine speed of 2000\u00a0rpm while SFC was not significantly higher for any of the BA-biodiesel blends because of the smaller heating value of BA. Comparing the effect on emissions of adding BA to biodiesel, increasing the amount of BA reduced NOx and CO (7%) and (40%) respectively compared to neat biodiesel, but increased UHC.",

The pilot fuel was admitted using a coaxial single-hole 100\u202f\u00b5m injector mounted on the cylinder periphery. Optical diagnostics include combined high-speed CH2O-PLIF (10\u202fkHz) and Schlieren (80\u202fkHz) imaging for detection of the first-stage ignition, and simultaneous high-speed OH* chemiluminescence (40\u202fkHz) imaging for high-temperature ignition. The aim of this study is to enhance the fundamental understanding of the interaction of methane with the auto-ignition process of short pilot-fuel injections. Addition of methane into the air charge considerably prolongs ignition delay of the pilot spray with an increasing effect at lower temperatures and with higher methane/air equivalence ratios. The temporal separation of the first CH2O detection and high-temperature ignition was found almost constant regardless of methane content. This was interpreted as methane mostly deferring the cool-flame reactivity. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms of this interaction, experimental investigations were complemented with 1D-flamelet simulations using detailed chemistry, confirming the chemical influence of methane deferring the reactivity in the pilot-fuel lean mixtures. This shifts the onset of first-stage reactivity towards the fuel-richer conditions. Consequently, the onset of the turbulent cool-flame is delayed, leading to an overall increased high-temperature ignition delay. Overall, the study reveals a complex interplay between entrainment, low T and high T chemistry and micro-mixing for dual-fuel auto-ignition processes for which the governing processes were identified.",

However, the detailed in-cylinder ignition and flame development process in these two CI modes were not clearly understood. In the present study, firstly, the fuel stratification, ignition and flame development in PPC and RCCI were comparatively studied on a light-duty optical engine using multiple optical diagnostic techniques. The overall fuel reactivity (PRF number) and concentration (fuel-air equivalence ratio) were kept at 70 and 0.77 for both modes, respectively. Iso-octane and n-heptane were separately used in the port-injection (PI) and direct-injection (DI) for RCCI, while PRF70 fuel was introduced through direct-injection (DI) for PPC. The DI timing for both modes was fixed at \u201325\u00b0CA ATDC. Secondly, the combustion characteristics of PPC and RCCI with more premixed charge were explored by increasing the PI mass fraction for RCCI and using the split DI strategy for PPC. In the first part, results show that RCCI has shorter ignition delay than PPC due to the fuel reactivity stratification. The natural flame luminosity, formaldehyde and OH PLIF images prove that the flame front propagation in the early stage of PPC can be seen, while there is no distinct flame front propagation in RCCI. In the second part, the higher premixed ratio results in more auto-ignition sites and faster combustion rate for PPC. However, the higher premixed ratio reduces the combustion rate in RCCI mode and the flame front propagation can be clearly seen, the flame speed of which is similar to that in spark ignition engines but lower than that in PPC. It can be concluded that the ratio of flame front propagation and auto-ignition in RCCI and PPC can be modulated by the control over the fuel stratification degree through different fuel-injection strategies.",

For both early and late micro-DI RCCI, the intermediate-temperature heat release (ITHR) of iso-octane, indicated by formaldehyde, takes place in the low-reactivity region before the arrival of the flame front. This is quite different from the flame front propagation in spark-ignition (SI) engine that shows no ITHR in the unburned region. The DI fuel mass is a key factor that affects the combustion in the low-reactivity region. If the DI fuel mass is quite low, there is more possibility of flame front propagation; otherwise, sequential auto-ignition dominates. The emergence of the flame front propagation in micro-DI RCCI strategy reduces its combustion rate and peak pressure rise rate.",

     "abstract": "The study of auto-ignition under temperature stratification is of great interest. Indeed, further understanding of the thermo-kinetic interactions and its influence on the combustion propagation regime is needed. In a previous work [1], experiments in a flat piston Rapid Compression Machine (RCM) demonstrated that the apparent propagation of reaction fronts is highly influenced by the typical temperature stratification observed at inert conditions. Nevertheless, the influence of low temperature heat release (LTHR) on the internal aerodynamics and temperature of the RCM is not well understood. In the present study, we first address the LTHR-flow interaction then address the LTHR-temperature interaction. We performed 2D-PIV experiments at 10\u202fkHz for inert and reactive lean isooctane mixtures. We averaged spatially the acceleration to present the time evolution during the cool flame period. We found that the normalized acceleration has a decreasing trend in both inert and reactive tests. No significant effect of the cool flame was observed on the trend. We performed temperature measurements using thin wire (7.6\u202f\u00b5m) type K thermocouples at inert and reactive n-hexane mixtures (same test conditions of Fig. 7 in [1]). The temperature evolution of the hot (adiabatically compressed) and the colder gases were recorded when cool flame occurs. The corrected gas temperature showed good agreement with the theoretical adiabatic core temperature as well as previous measurements with toluene LIF. In the tested case, we found that the cool flame induces an equal temperature rise of approximately 110\u202fK in both the adiabatically compressed and the colder vortex gases. These results confirm quantitatively that LTHR does not significantly affect the mixing of the temperature stratification of our flat piston RCM. In the studied test conditions, the temperature stratification is conserved globally despite the LTHR.",

In the present study, two-dimensional direct numerical simulations are performed to investigate the ignition dynamics and their sensitivity to thermochemical and mixing parameters. The thermochemical and mixing conditions are matched to the benchmark Spray A experiment from the Engine Combustion Network. The results reveal a complex ignition process with overlapping stages of: low-temperature ignition (cool flames), rich premixed ignition, and nonpremixed ignition, which are qualitatively consistent with prior experimental and numerical investigations, however, this is the first time that fully-resolved simulations have been reported at the actual Spray A thermochemical condition. Parametric variations are then performed for the Damk\u00f6hler number Da, oxidiser temperature, oxygen concentration, and peak mixture fraction (a measure of premixedness), to study their effect on the ignition dynamics. It is observed that with both increasing oxidiser temperature and decreasing oxygen concentration, that the cool flame moves to richer mixtures, the overlap in the ignition stages decreases, and the (nondimensional) time taken to reach a fully burning state increases. With increasing Da, the cool-flame speed is decreased due to lower mean mixing rates, which causes a delayed onset of high-temperature ignition. With increasing peak mixture fraction, the onset of each stage of ignition is not affected, but the overall duration of the ignition increases leading to a longer burn duration. Overall, the results suggest that turbulence\u2013chemistry interactions play a significant role in determining the timing and location in composition space of the entire ignition process.",

However, high exergy loss is also observed within this combustion concept. The present study focuses on the homogeneous combustion process and examines the detailed exergy destruction mechanisms under representative LTC engine conditions. By varying both equivalence ratios (\u03c6) and temperatures (T) at initial pressure of 50\u202fbar, it is found that the decreased total exergy destruction fraction (fED) with increasing initial temperature mainly results from the decreased exergy destruction in the high temperature heat release stage, while using rich mixture can significantly reduce the fED in the ignition delay stage, which is dominated by the reactions involving large molecules (C7 species). Reaction pathway analysis reveals that the detailed exergy destruction sources are significantly affected by the reaction pathways. Furthermore, a qualitative exergy loss \u03c6-T map was created to illustrate the exergy loss reduction potential. It is concluded that the combustion pathway that reforming the rich fuel/air mixtures before ignition followed by the low temperature combustion of lean reforming products offers the potential to simultaneously reduce exergy destruction and avoid soot and NOx formation. However, the potential advantages of this exergy reduction combustion concept still require further work.",

     "abstract": "Knowledge of the autoignition characteristics of diesel fuels is of great importance for understanding the combustion performance in engines and developing surrogate fuels. Here ignition delays of China's stage 6 diesel, a commercial fuel, were measured in a heated rapid compression machine (RCM) under engine-relevant conditions. Gas-phase autoignition experiments were carried out at equivalence ratios ranging from 0.37 to 1.0, under compressed pressures of 10, 15, and 20\u202fbar, and within a temperature range of 685\u2013865\u202fK. In all investigated conditions, negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior of the total ignition delays is observed. The autoignition of the diesel fuel exhibits pronounced two-stage characteristics with strong low-temperature reactivity. Experimental results indicate that the total ignition delays shorten with increasing compressed pressure, oxygen mole fraction and fuel mole fraction. The first-stage ignition delays are mainly controlled by compressed temperature and also affected by oxygen mole fraction and compressed pressure but show a very weak dependence on fuel mole fraction. Correlations describing the first-stage ignition delay and the total ignition delay were proposed to further clarify the ignition delay dependence on the multiple factors. Additionally, it is found that the newly measured ignition delays well coincide with and complement the diesel ignition data in the literature. A recently developed diesel mechanism was used to simulate the diesel autoignition on the RCM. The simulation results are found to agree well the experimental measurements over the whole temperature ranges. Species concentration analysis and brute force sensitivity analysis were also conducted to identify the crucial species and reactions controlling the autoignition of the diesel fuel.",

     "abstract": "Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology can be used in internal combustion engines to reduce NOx emission and improve fuel economy. However, it also affects the end-gas autoignition and engine knock since NOx in EGR can promote ignition. In this study, effects of NOx addition on autoignition and detonation development in dimethyl ether (DME)/air mixture under engine-relevant conditions are investigated. Numerical simulation considering both low-temperature and high-temperature chemistry is conducted. First the kinetic effects of NOx addition on the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime are assessed and interpreted. It is found that NOx addition greatly promotes both low-temperature and high-temperature ignition stages mainly through increasing OH production. Then the autoignitive reaction front propagation induced by either local NO accumulation or a cold spot within NTC regime with different amounts of NO addition is investigated. For the first time, supersonic autoignition modes including detonation induced by local NO accumulations are identified. This indicates that local accumulation of NOx in end gas might induce super-knock in engines with EGR. A new parameter quantifying the ratio of sound speed to average reaction front propagation speed is introduced to identify the regimes for different autoignition modes. Compared to the traditional counterpart parameter used in previous studies, this new parameter is more suitable since it yields a detonation development regime in a C-shaped curve which is almost unaffected by the initial conditions. The results in this study may provide fundamental insights into knocking mechanism in engines using EGR technology.",

     "abstract": "Post injection has significant benefit in the reduction of diesel soot emissions. Therefore, there is a need to understand the effect of post-injection strategy on soot physicochemical properties and reactivity because they play an important role in soot oxidation process that governs the final soot emissions. This work focuses on the impact of post injection on the physicochemical properties and reactivity of diesel in-cylinder soot using a main plus post injection (M*P) and a single injection (M) strategy. The soot was sampled by a developed total cylinder sampling system, and the dividing points of soot formation-dominant and oxidation-dominant phases were used for studying the impacts of post injection on the characteristics of in-cylinder soot. The physicochemical properties of the soot samples, including primary particle size, nanostructure, carbon chemical state and surface functional groups, were characterized. The soot reactivity was evaluated in terms of peak temperature, burnout temperature and apparent activation energy. In the oxidation-dominant phase, the M*P soot initially possesses smaller primary particle size, shorter fringe length, larger tortuosity, lower sp2/sp3 hybridization ratio of carbon atoms and higher content of aliphatic CH groups than the M soot. The beneficial influence of physicochemical properties on soot reactivity when using post injection is validated by the thermogravimetric data, which shows that the M*P soot is more reactive than the M soot at the onset of the oxidation-dominant phase. In the M*P case, the soot generated from the main-injection combustion has lower reactivity than the soot from the post-injection combustion after they experience the soot formation-dominant phase. The results indicate that the use of post injection leads to in-cylinder soot with physicochemical properties that favor reactivity. The enhancement of reactivity means that the soot will be more readily oxidized in the subsequent combustion process, and consequently contributes to a reduction in final soot emissions.",

The model uses a population balance approach to describe the size of the particles entering and leaving the DPF, and accumulated within it. The population balance is coupled to a unit collector model that describes the filtration of the particles in the porous walls of the DPF and a reactor network model that is used to describe the geometry of the DPF. Two versions of the unit collector model were investigated. The original version, based on current literature, and an extended version, developed in this work that includes terms to describe both the non-uniform regeneration of the cake and thermal expansion of the pores in the DPF. Simulations using the original unit collector model were able to provide a good description of the pressure drop and PM filtration efficiency during the loading of the DPF, but were unable to adequately describe the change in filtration efficiency during regeneration of the DPF. The introduction of the extended unit collector description enabled the model to describe both the timing of particle breakthrough and the final steady filtration efficiency of the hot regenerated DPF. Further work is required to understand better the transient behaviour of the system. In particular, we stress the importance that future experiments fully characterise the particle size distribution at both the inlet and outlet of the DPF.",

For various injection pressures, planar laser induced incandescence (PLII) imaging and planar laser-induced fluorescence of hydroxyl (OH-PLIF) imaging were performed to understand the temporal and spatial development of soot and high-temperature flames. In addition, a thermophoresis-based particle sampling technique was used to obtain transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of soot aggregates and primary particles for detailed morphology analysis. The OH-PLIF images suggest that an increase in the injection pressure leads to wider distribution of high-temperature flames likely due to better mixing. The enhanced high-temperature reaction can promote soot formation evidenced by both a faster increase of LII signals and larger soot aggregates on the TEM images. However, the increased OH radicals at higher injection pressure accelerates the soot oxidation as shown in a higher decreasing rate of LII signals as well as dramatic reduction of the sampled soot aggregates at later crank angles. The analysis of nanoscale carbon layer fringe structures also shows a consistent trend that, at higher injection pressure, the soot particles are more oxidized to form more graphitic carbon layer structures. Therefore, it is concluded that the in-cylinder soot reduction at higher injection pressure conditions is due to enhanced soot oxidation despite increased soot formation.",

The thermophoresis-based particle sampling method was used to collect soot from three different in-flame locations including the flame\u2013wall impingement point near the jet axis and the two 60\u00b0 off-axis locations on the up-swirl and down-swirl side of the wall-interacting jet. The sampled soot particle images were obtained using transmission electron microscopes and the image post-processing was conducted for statistical analysis of size distribution of soot primary particles and aggregates, fractal dimension, and sub-nanoscale parameters such as the carbon layer fringe length, tortuosity, and spacing. The results show that the jet-wall impingement region is dominated by many small immature particles with amorphous internal structure, which is very different to large, fractal-like soot aggregates sampled from 60\u00b0 downstream location on the down-swirl side. This structure variation suggests that the small immature particles underwent surface growth, coagulation and aggregation as they travelled along the piston-bowl wall. During this soot growth, the particle internal structure exhibits the transformation from amorphous carbon segments to a typical core\u2013shell structure. Compared to those on the down-swirl side, the soot particles sampled on the up-swirl side show much lower number counts and more compact aggregates composed of highly concentrated primary particles. This soot aggregate structure, together with much narrower carbon layer gap, indicates higher level of soot oxidation on the up-swirl side of the jet.",

Increasing evidence in the literature supports the fact that the current regulatory measures of fuel anti-knock quality, the research octane number (RON), and motor octane number (MON), are becoming decreasingly relevant to commercial engines. Extrapolation and interpolation of the RON/MON scales to the thermodynamic conditions of modern engines is potentially valuable for the synergistic design of fuels and engines with greater efficiency. The K-value approach, which linearly weights the RON/MON scales based on the thermodynamic history of an engine, offers a convenient experimental method to do so, although complementary theoretical interpretations of K-value measurements are lacking in the literature.This work uses a phenomenological engine model with a detailed chemical kinetic model to predict and interpret known trends in the K-value with respect to engine intake temperature, pressure, and engine speed. The modelling results support experimental trends which show that the K-value increases with increasing intake temperature and engine speed, and decreases with increasing intake pressure. A chemical kinetic interpretation of trends in the K-value based on fundamental ignition behaviour is presented. The results show that combined experimental/theoretical approaches, which employ a knowledge of fundamental fuel data (gas phase kinetics, ignition delay times), can provide a reliable means to assess trends in the real-world performance of commercial fuels under the operating conditions of modern engines.",

This paper presents first DNS and LES of spark ignition with a real automotive coil and simplified pin-pin electrodes. The electrical circuit characteristics are provided by ISSIM while the energy deposition is modelled by Lagrangian particles. The ignition model is first evaluated in terms of initial spark radius on a pin-pin ignition experiment in pure air performed at CORIA and EM2C laboratories, showing that it pilots the radius of the torus formed by the initial shock wave.

Replacing the two-step chemistry by an analytically reduced mechanism leads to similar MIE but shows a different ignition kernel shape.

Inspection of the temperature\u2013pressure history overlaid on ignition delay contours allow the results to be explained.

Simultaneous heat release analysis and high speed combustion imaging were used to study the pre-ignition and combustion processes. Outlier detection based on robust statistical methods was validated as an effective and efficient approach to identify sporadic pre-ignition. When pre-ignition occurred, the pre-ignited flame-front exhibited much faster propagating speed than that of the normal spark-ignited flame-front in the first stage of flame development. In several cycles, pre-ignition was followed by the pre-ignited propagating flame-front and then a separate spark-ignited flame-front before they subsequently merged together. In a few other cycles, pre-ignition led to heavy knocking combustion caused either by the auto-ignition close to the flame-front or near the cylinder wall, or both. The ultimate knock intensity of such cycles was determined by the timing, size, and location of end-gas auto-ignition of the unburned gas. Furthermore, optical detection of the oil droplet entrained combustion in the cycle subsequent to the knocking combustion cycle implied that high frequency oscillation pressure waves ejected lubricant from the piston-ring crevice.",

We assumed that a locally lean spot and rich spots exist in the end gas owing to inhomogeneous mixing and calculated their thermodynamic states with a multizone spark-ignition engine simulation. Subsequently, the ignition delay around the state was measured using a rapid compression machine at varying temperatures and equivalence ratios. The obtained results were processed to calculate \u03be, which is the ratio of sound speed to auto-ignition propagation speed, and \u03f5 , defined as the time required for acoustic front to exit the hot spot divided by the excitation time. Then, we analyzed the knocking occurrence and intensity from the locally lean spot and rich spots based on Zel'dovich and Bradley's \u03be\u2013 \u03f5 theory. Our results show that the lean spot has a shorter ignition delay than the stoichiometric mixture (\u03be\u202f>\u202f0) regardless of the ethanol content, whereas the rich spot does not (\u03be\u202f<\u202f0), implying that only the lean spot can initiate knocking. This is because the temperature of the lean spot is higher than the surrounding mixture owing to its higher specific heat ratio and less charge cooling effect. In addition, the knocking intensity from the lean spot is found to be maximized with ERF0, showing the largest \u03be \u2212 2 value. Further analysis was conducted by dividing \u03be into the effect of the temperature gradient, \u03beT, and that of the equivalence ratio gradient, \u03be\u03d5.

Fast evaporation and combustion technique has caused unprecedented attention due to its potential to solve both of the above challenges. Flash boiling, which features a two-phase flow that constantly generates vapor bubbles inside the liquid spray is ideal to achieve fast evaporation and combustion inside direct-injection (DI) gasoline engines. In this study, three spray conditions, including liquid, transitional flash boiling and flare flash boiling spray were studied for comparison under cold start condition in a spark-ignition direct-injection (SIDI) optical gasoline engine. Optical access into the combustion chamber includes a quartz linear and a quartz insert on the piston. In separate experiments, we recorded the crank angle resolved spray morphology using laser scattering technique, and distribution of fuel before ignition employing laser induced fluorescence technology, as well as time-resolved color images of flame with high-speed camera. The spray morphology during the intake stroke shows stronger plume-plume and plume-air interaction under flash boiling condition, as well as smaller penetration. Then around the end of compression (before ignition), the fuel distribution is also shown to be more homogeneous with less cyclic variation under flash boiling. Finally, from the color images of the flame, it was found that with the increase of superheat degree, the diffusion rate of blue flame (generated by excited molecules) is higher, which is considered to be related with the larger fractal dimension of the flame front. Also, the combustion is more complete with less yellow flame under flash boiling.",

     "abstract": "In this study, the influence of the three-dimensional (3D) in-cylinder flow on engine's cycle-to-cycle variations (CCV) in a spray-guided direct-injection spark-ignition engine is investigated. The engine is operated at homogeneous lean air\u2013fuel mixture which enhances the sensitivity to CCV due to reduced laminar flame speed. To compensate this, intake velocity is increased by a tumble-flap (TF) in the intake-port. To address the 3D-nature of the temporal evolution of the instantaneous in-cylinder flow for different TF-positions, time-resolved scanning particle image velocimetry (Scanning-PIV) is applied to the engine. The required scan-frequency is provided by an acousto-optical-deflector (AOD) to measure the flow field quasi-simultaneously in the central tumble-plane and both mid-valve-planes. The three planes are 18\u202fmm displaced from each other to capture the variability of the large-scale tumble vortex. The in-cylinder flow measurements are combined with combustion analyses by the in-cylinder pressure-trace and the detection of the location of ignition through the evaluation of the luminous spark-plasma. A correlation-map analysis is conducted to identify coherent flow features responsible for CCV of the combustion parameters. This reveals a strong dependency of the spark position to variations of an upward directed flow pointing onto the spark plug. The variations of the upward flow are due to strong CCV of the bended tumble-axis position. An increased tumble motion caused by the TF results in favorable flow conditions by stabilizing the tumble-axis in the middle of the cylinder which decreases the CCV of the spark position significantly. Further correlation analysis including the combustion process exhibits that flow-structures moving the spark and early flame kernel towards the cylinder center reduces the crank angle of 5% heat release and the combustion duration considerably.",

     "abstract": "Cycle-to-cycle variation (CCV) limits how lean a spark-ignited (SI) internal combustion engine (ICE) can stably operate at, restricts efficiency, and increases emissions through incomplete combustion. Therefore, a way to cleaner, more efficient SI ICEs is to minimize the CCV. Current methods to study CCV include experimental investigations and CFD-based numerical simulations. This study, in contrast, investigates the ability of neural networks to accurately model the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and its coefficient of variation (COV of IMEP). Experimental data from a previous study of spark-ignited propane/air combustion in the TCC-III engine was used to train and evaluate a neural network. An optimized network was generated that utilizes 109 experimental inputs and is operated with 15 neurons in one hidden layer to determine IMEP for 18 engine operating conditions, with 625 individual consecutive engine cycles for each condition. The impact of training set size and the number of input parameters was also investigated. The average deviation for IMEP from the experimental measurements is 0.7\u20132.2% for the training data set and less than 12% for the entire predicted range of operating conditions. Data sets consisted of tests under rich, lean, and stoichiometric conditions without and with 9% nitrogen dilution. Predicted COV of IMEP strongly correlates with experimental data (R2\u202f=\u202f0.8453). However, a systematic over prediction of COV of IMEP for low COVs was observed while higher COVs were under-predicted by the neural network. The cause for this systematic behavior has not yet been identified but histograms of the predicted IMEP data indicate that this could be related to missing physical parameters that have a significant impact on combustion variability.",

     "abstract": "This study investigates the influence of large-scale flow features, including flow structure and velocity magnitude, on the early-burn period variability in a homogenous-charge spark-ignited engine fueled with premixed propane-air mixture. Particle image velocimetry and in-cylinder pressure measurement data from a previous study - were processed to enable simultaneous flow characterization and flame-front tracking as well as apparent heat-release analysis. By combining probability analysis of flame development with conditional sampling of fast and slow early-burn cycles using 10% fuel mass fraction burned, it is shown that an undesirable flow structure produces an asymmetric flame development at the initial flame growth period. This asymmetric flame structure persists through the whole initial-to-turbulent transition period until the flame becomes fully turbulent. The undesirable flow condition is characterized by large-scale convective flows near spark plug rather than flows that lead to increased flame spread in multiple directions. The simultaneous flow and flame characterization enables the quantifications of flame-front propagation speed, unburned fuel-air mixture velocity ahead of flame front and local burning velocity at flame surface. Here the local burning velocity is referred to as laminar or turbulent flame speed. A simplified approach is introduced to derive integrated values for these quantities per crank-angle-degree, enabling the quantitative comparison of the trend-wise difference in these integrated metrics between fast and slow early-burn cycles. It is revealed that for the transition period, the CCV in the velocity magnitude of unburned fuel-air mixture ahead of the flame front accounts for nearly 50% to the variability of flame propagation speed. The burning velocity provides the remaining source of the flame propagation variability in this period. The flame propagation variations in the initial flame growth and fully turbulent periods are smaller than those in the transition period and are primarily dependent on the variability of large-scale flow features.",

     "abstract": "A late-injection strategy is typically adopted in stratified-charge direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engines to improve combustion stability for lean operation, but this may induce wall wetting on the piston surface and result in high soot emissions. E30 fuel, i.e., gasoline with 30% ethanol, is a potential alternative fuel that can offer a high Research Octane Number. However, the relatively high ethanol content increases the heat of vaporization, potentially exacerbating wall-wetting issues in DISI engines. In this study, the Refractive Index Matching (RIM) technique is used to measure fuel wall films in the piston bowl. The RIM implementation uses a novel LED illumination, integrated in the piston assembly and providing side illumination of the piston-bowl window. This RIM diagnostics in combination with high-speed imaging was used to investigate the impact of coolant temperature on the characteristics of wall wetting and combustion in an optical DISI engine fueled with E30. The experiments reveal that the smoke emissions increase drastically from 0.068 FSN to 1.14 FSN when the coolant temperature is reduced from 90\u00a0\u00b0C to 45\u00a0\u00b0C. Consistent with this finding, natural flame luminosity imaging reveals elevated soot incandescence with a reduction of the coolant temperature, indicative of pool fires. The RIM diagnostics show that a lower coolant temperature also leads to increased fuel film thickness, area, and volume, explaining the onset of pool fires and smoke.",

Toliso, a mixture containing isooctane and toluene (65\u202fvol% isooctane and 35\u202fvol% toluene) was utilised as a surrogate gasoline fuel. The EGR (EGR-exhaust gas recirculation) rate-dependence and the effect of ethanol blending (0, 20 and 40% ethanol, E0\u2013E40) were studied at part load operation with two different injection timings. Operating point 1 (OP1) represents an early injection with piston wetting and pool fire, operating point 2 (OP2) represents a late injection timing with reduced time for mixture formation. Soot formation is more pronounced for OP1 and for E20 and E40 as compared to E0. Here the pool fire due to the fuel-dependent liquid wall film formation plays a major role in soot formation and oxidation. Late injection timing leads to increased soot formation for E20 compared to Toliso, while E40 shows lowest soot formation. Here the fuel\u2013wall wetting is less pronounced, but mixture inhomogeneities exist, and the soot cloud covers a larger region in the cylinder. An EGR addition leads to a higher soot formation for Toliso for both operating points. The ethanol-blends show a reduction of the soot formation with EGR, which is explained by reduced combustion temperatures and the chemically bound oxygen for E20 and E40 leading to locally leaner mixtures at constant global air\u2013fuel ratio.

The limited number of available investigations have focused on non-reacting flows near engine surfaces, while this work focuses on the near-wall flow-field dynamics in response to a propagating flame front. Flow-field and flame distributions were measured simultaneously at kHz repetition rates using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) and planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of sulfur dioxide (SO2). Measurements were performed near the piston surface of an optically accessible engine operating at 800\u202frpm with homogeneous, stoichiometric isooctane-air mixtures. High-speed measurements reveal a strong interdependency between near-wall flow and flame development which also influences subsequent combustion. A conditional analysis is performed to analyze flame/flow dynamics at the piston surface for cycles with \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018strong\u2019 flow velocities parallel to the surface. Faster flame propagation associated with higher velocities before ignition demonstrates a stronger flow acceleration ahead of the flame. Flow acceleration associated with an advancing flame front is a transient feature that strongly influences boundary layer development. The distance from the wall to 75% maximum velocity (\u03b475) is analyzed to compare boundary layer development between fired and motored datasets. Decreases in \u03b475 are strongly related to flow acceleration produced by an approaching flame front. Measurements reveal strong deviations of the boundary layer flow between fired and motored datasets, emphasizing the need to consider transient flow behavior when modeling boundary layer physics for reacting flows.",

Auto-ignition is triggered by the increases in pressure and temperature induced by the main combustion flame. Similarly to engine knocking, heat is released in two stages when engines undergo this type of combustion. This pattern of heat release does not occur during normal combustion. However, engine knocking induces pressure oscillations that cause fatal damage to engines, whereas PREMIER combustion does not. The purpose of this study was to elucidate PREMIER combustion in natural gas spark-ignition engines, and differentiate the causes of knocking and PREMIER combustion. We applied combustion visualization and in-cylinder pressure analysis using a compression\u2013expansion machine (CEM) to investigate the auto-ignition characteristics in the end-gas region of a natural gas spark-ignition engine. We occasionally observed knocking accompanied by pressure oscillations under the spark timings and initial gas conditions used to generate PREMIER combustion. No pressure oscillations were observed during normal and PREMIER combustion. Auto-ignition in the end-gas region was found to induce a secondary increase in pressure before the combustion flame reached the cylinder wall, during both knocking and PREMIER combustion. The auto-ignited flame area spread faster during knocking than during PREMIER combustion. This caused a sudden pressure difference and imbalance between the flame propagation region and the end-gas region, followed by a pressure oscillation.",

NG requires forced ignition, but conventional gasoline-engine ignition systems are not optimized for NG and are challenged to ignite mixtures that are lean or diluted with exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR). NG ignition is particularly difficult in large-bore engines, where it is more challenging to complete combustion in the time available. High-speed infrared (IR) in-cylinder imaging and image-derived quantitative metrics were used to compare two ignition systems in terms of the early flame-kernel development and cycle-to-cycle variability (CCV) in a heavy-duty, natural-gas-fueled engine that had been modified to enable exhaust-gas recirculation and to provide optical access via borescopes. Imaging in the near IR and short-wavelength IR yielded strong signals from the water emission lines, which acted as a proxy for flame front and burned-gas regions while obviating image intensification (which can reduce spatial resolution). The ignition systems studied were a conventional system and a high-frequency corona system. The air/fuel mixtures investigated included stoichiometric without dilution and lean with EGR. The corona system produced five separate elongated, irregularly shaped, nonequilibrium-plasma streamers, leading to immediate formation of five spatially distinct wrinkled flame kernels around each streamer. Compared to the conventional spark ignition, which produces a single flame kernel that exhibits an initial laminar growth regime before wrinkling, corona ignition's early achievement of higher flame surface areas significantly shortened the ignition delay, resulting in reduced overall combustion duration and CCV for each mixture. Additionally, although the lean, dilute mixture produced higher CCV than the stoichiometric, minimally diluted mixture with both igniters, the mixtures ignited by the corona system suffered less than those ignited by the conventional system. Image-based measurements of CCV agreed with those based on in-cylinder pressure.",

Cetane numbers vary from 30 to 55 (increment of 5) while holding other properties relatively constant by adjusting chemical group composition. Main cetane variation was controlled through the distribution of normal alkanes and isoalkanes, which was fine-tuned using additives. Other fuel properties such as density, viscosity, H/C ratio, etc. were balanced using cyclic compounds and aromatics. Fuels were tested in the RCM at compressed pressures of Pc=\u202f10 and 20\u202fbar, equivalence ratios of \u03d5\u202f=\u202f0.25, 0.5 and 1.0, in the low to intermediate temperature range (620\u202fK\u202f\u2264\u202fTc\u202f\u2264\u202f730\u202fK). Relations between cetane number and ignition delay time have been evaluated at multiple test conditions, and further analysis on multistage ignition has been conducted. Ignition delay times of fuels with higher cetane numbers are shorter at these temperatures for most conditions. First stage ignition delay time measurements have been observed to be relatively insensitive to Pc, \u03d5, and fuel type, while deviations in overall ignition delay times are mainly attributed to second stage ignition delay time, impacted by variations in the first stage temperature. Control fuels of this type offer an opportunity to be used in practical experiments to determine the impact of cetane number on combustion dynamics.",

High-speed OH-PLIF as well as OH chemiluminescence imaging is applied to obtain complementary planar and line-of-sight integrated information on the ignition. We find experimental evidence for the co-existence of two regimes dominating the chamber ignition, i.e. autoignition and flame propagation. As the mass flow of the dilution air injected downstream of the first stage is increased (i.e. mixing temperatures in the fuel mixing section are decreased), we transition from an autoignition to a flame propagation dominated regime. Hysteresis in the ignition behavior is observed indicating that the first stage in a sequential combustor may be operated at leaner conditions than required for ignition of the second stage.

The present analysis focuses on two additional operating points with liquid n-heptane sprays and the turbulent flame propagation in the two-phase mixture is examined through the behavior of its leading points. The validation of the light-round process is characterized in terms of ignition delays. The detailed analysis of the propagation through the definition of a leading point enables to highlight some key phenomena responsible for the flame behavior, such as the influence of the liquid droplet spray and its vaporization in the chamber. Calculations indicate that the volumetric expansion due to the chemical reaction at the flame induces a strong azimuthal flow in the fresh stream at a distance of several sectors ahead of the flame, which modifies conditions in this region. This creates heterogeneities in the gas composition and wakes on the downstream side of the swirling jets formed by the injectors, with notable effects on the motion of the leading point and on the absolute flame velocity.",

The mean curvature of the stagnation line displayed a large spatial scale pattern that was present for all operating conditions. All three components of velocity, in-plane shear, and swirling strength are conditioned upon the instantaneous stagnation line. Mean distributions of the velocity normal to the stagnation line show that velocity is oriented towards the CRZ when the stagnation line is found nearer the centerline of the combustor. The conditioned out-of-plane velocity (w) shows a distinct concentration of large mean and fluctuation RMS values towards the center of the measurement domain. Varying fuel flow does not significantly change this spatial structure, only the magnitudes of the w statistics. The in-plane shear stress was the largest for the pilot biased condition as a stronger shear layer develops. For the leanest flame, large fluctuation RMS values of shear stress were confined to a region where the pilot jet begins to interact more heavily with the main jet. Operating with less pilot fuel flow enhanced the mean conditional swirling strength indicating that the pilot shear layer was shedding more intense eddies. Disregarding spatial relations, a scatter plot of w, shear stress, and swirling strength displayed trends between the variables. The largest swirling strength values coincide with highest magnitude shear stresses and the widest range of w. These conditioned statistics highlight how certain aspects of the combustor flow field are invariant with fuel distribution.

An Analytically Reduced Chemistry (ARC) including 34 transported species and 586 irreversible reactions is used to describe the coupled combustion and plasma kinetics.

For ignition to be successful, an important aspect is the ability of the hot gas generated by the spark discharge to initiate combustion reactions, leading to the formation of a self-sustained ignition kernel. This study focuses on this phenomena by performing simulations of kernel ignition in a crossflow configuration that was characterized experimentally. First, inert simulations are performed to identify numerical parameters correctly reproducing the kernel ejection from the ignition cavity, which is here modeled as a pulsed jet. In particular, the kernel diameter and the transit time of the kernel to the reacting mixture are matched with measurements. Considering stochastic perturbations of the ejection velocity of the ignition kernel, the variability of the kernel transit time is also reproduced by the simulations. Subsequently, simulations of a series of ignition sequences are performed with varying equivalence ratio of the fuel-air mixture in the crossflow. The numerical results are shown to reproduce the ignition failure that occurs for the leanest equivalence ratio ( \u03d5 = 0.6 ). For higher equivalence ratios, the simulations are shown to capture the sensitivity of the ignition to the equivalence ratio, and the kernel successfully transitions into a propagating flame. Significant stochastic dispersion of the ignition strength is observed, which relates to the variability of the transit time of the kernel to the reactive mixture. An analysis of the structure of the ignition kernel also highlights the transition towards a self-propagating flame for successful ignition conditions.",

This analysis is guided by employing early warning indicators from dynamical system analysis to identify critical transition points and precursors that trigger the onset of blow-out. It is found that the variance of the integrated heat release is a sensible quantity as an early warning signal in detecting blow-out. Detailed comparisons are then performed between the two models to examine the difference in terms of the blow-out mechanism. The comparison reveals that the different phases of the transient blow-out sequence are qualitatively similar for the two models. However, local extinction phenomena are more significant for the TFLES model, reducing the stabilizing feedback by hot combustion products and leading to a total blow-off time, which is three times shorter compared to FPV.",

     "abstract": "The chemical functional group approach is investigated to verify the fundamental applicability of low-dimensional descriptors in the prediction of global combustion behavior, as described by homogeneous reflected shock ignition delay times. Three key chemical functional groups, CH2, CH3 and benzyl-type, are used to represent n-alkyl, iso-alkyl, and aromatic functionalities, respectively. To examine whether such descriptors can appropriately reflect the influences of these functionalities on ignition delay, Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) regression analysis is performed with the formulation of analytical models based on a fundamental Arrhenius-type description. The models are trained using literature measurements of reflected shock ignition delay times for stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures at 20 atm. Sensitivity analyses applied to the QSPR regression models show that the CH2 functional group dominates chemical kinetic behaviors at low temperature, while the chemical kinetic impacts of CH2, CH3, and benzyl-type functional groups all diminish as temperature increases. Further analyses of constant-volume adiabatic ignition delay predictions using detailed chemical kinetic models demonstrate influences of n-alkyl, iso-alkyl, and aromatic functionalities at both low and high temperature, consistent with those found for the QSPR regression models. Finally, 1H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to directly quantify the chemical functional group compositions of both petroleum-derived and alternative jet fuels. Combining the QSPR model with NMR spectra interpretation, the applicability of current approach as an expeditious tool to accurately characterize the ignition propensity of real transportation fuels is demonstrated by comparison with experimental measurements.",

A new forcing configuration permitted not only the pressure amplitude, but also the spin ratio and mode orientation to be accurately controlled, in order to generate standing modes and for the first time strong spinning modes in both a clockwise (CW) and anti-clockwise (ACW) direction. The phase averaged heat release dynamics of these modes was compared and a number of differences observed depending on the direction of pressure wave propagation, demonstrating characteristic ACW and CW heat release patterns. A new spin compensating averaging method was then introduced to analyse the flame dynamics, and it was shown that through the application of this method the dynamics of standing wave oscillations could be decomposed to recover the characteristic ACW and CW heat release responses. The global heat release response was also assessed during strongly spinning modes, and the magnitude of the response was shown to depend strongly on the direction of propagation, demonstrating the importance of the local swirl direction on the global heat release response, with important implications for the modelling of such flows.",

We study this interaction during the intermittency route to thermoacoustic instability when the location of the flame is varied inside the combustor. As the flame location is changed, the synchronization properties of the coupled acoustic pressure and heat release rate signals change from desynchronized aperiodicity (combustion noise) to phase synchronized periodicity (thermoacoustic instability) through intermittent phase synchronization (intermittency). We also characterize the collective interaction between the multiple flamelets anchored at the flame holder and the acoustic field in the system, during different dynamical states observed in the combustor operation. When the signals are desynchronized, we notice that the flamelets exhibit a steady combustion without the exhibition of a prominent feedback with the acoustic field. In a state of intermittent phase synchronization, we observe the existence of a short-term coupling between the heat release rate and the acoustic field. We notice that the onset of collective synchronization in the oscillations of multiple flamelets and the acoustic field leads to the simultaneous emergence of periodicity in the global dynamics of the system. This collective periodicity in both the subsystems causes enhancement of oscillations during epochs of amplitude growth in the intermittency signal. On the contrary, the weakening of the coupling induces suppression of periodic oscillations during epochs of amplitude decay in the intermittency signal. During phase synchronization, we notice a sustained synchronized movement of all flamelets with the periodicity of the acoustic cycle in the system.",

     "abstract": "In this paper we investigate self-excited azimuthal modes in an annular combustor with turbulent premixed bluff-body stabilised flames. Previous studies have shown that both swirl and equivalence ratio influence modal dynamics, i.e. the time-varying nature of the modes. However, self-excited azimuthal modes have not yet been investigated in turbulent flames without bulk swirl, which do not generate any preferential flow in either azimuthal direction, and may therefore lead to different behaviour. Joint probability density functions of the instability amplitudes at various flowrates and equivalence ratios showed a strong bi-modal response favouring both ACW and CW spinning states not previously observed. Operating conditions leading to a bi-modal response provide a unique opportunity to investigate whether the structure of the global fluctuating heat release rate of self-excited spinning modes in both directions exhibit similar dynamics and structure. This was investigated using high-speed OH* chemiluminescence images of the annular combustor and a new rotational averaging method was applied which decomposes the spinning components of the global fluctuating heat release rate. The new rotational averaging, which differs from standard phase-averaging, produces spatial averages in a frame of reference moving with the spinning wave. The results show that the structure of the fluctuating heat release rate for spinning modes is highly asymmetric as characterised by large, crescent shaped regions of high OH* intensity, located on the far side of each flame, relative to the direction of the azimuthally propagating pressure wave. In comparison with interacting swirling flames, these results indicate that the previously observed radial asymmetry of OH* fluctuations may be introduced through advection by local swirl.",

     "abstract": "The presence of strong interactions between adjacent flames is inevitable in most practical gas turbine combustion systems. Despite the fundamental and practical importance of this configuration, an accurate description of the dynamics of multiple interacting swirl-stabilized flames is still lacking. To better understand the key processes, we have examined flame transfer/describing functions (FTF/FDF) of two interacting lean-premixed flames in a model gas turbine combustor equipped with two identical fuel nozzles. Unlike non-swirling flames, two adjacent swirl-stabilized flames are defined as having either co-rotating or counter-rotating interaction, depending on the relative direction of azimuthal velocity components. The FTF/FDF of interacting swirl flames for these two impingement conditions are analyzed in reference to the corresponding single nozzle (SN) data to provide physically important insight into the nature of flame\u2013flame interactions in a multi-nozzle (MN) environment. It is first shown that both FTF and FDF are heavily influenced by the combination of swirl rotational directions, since the local flame/flow properties in the interacting region are mainly controlled by the jet impingement patterns. Our results suggest that there is considerable discrepancy between the SN and MN data, implying that the use of SN FTF data for the prediction of the MN flame dynamics can lead to erroneous results. Quantitative analyses of extensive self-excited instability data reveal that the degree of temporal synchronization between adjacent flames is a necessary condition for the onset of the instabilities.",

Simulations provide a detailed insight into flame root stabilization mechanisms for these diffusion flames: they show that the large wall heat losses at the lips of the coaxial injector are of primary importance, and require to solve for the fully coupled conjugate heat transfer problem. In order to account for flame\u2013wall interaction (FWI) at the injector lip, detailed chemistry effects are also prevalent and a detailed kinetic mechanism for CH4 oxycombustion at high pressure is derived and validated. This kinetic scheme is used in a real-gas fluid solver, coupled with a solid thermal solver in the splitter plate to calculate the unsteady temperature field in the lip. A simulation with adiabatic boundary conditions, an hypothesis that is often used in real-gas combustion, is also performed for comparison. It is found that adiabatic walls simulations lead to enhanced cryogenic reactants vaporization and mixing, and to a quasi-steady flame, which anchors within the oxidizer stream. On the other hand, FWI simulations produce self-sustained oscillations of both lip temperature and flame root location at similar frequencies: the flame root moves from the CH4 to the O2 streams at approximately 450\u00a0Hz, affecting the whole flame structure.",

     "abstract": "This study investigates the flame-flow interaction during a fully-premixed swirl flame flashback from flame-frame-of-reference. To capture the flame front movement during upstream propagation, high-speed chemiluminescence imaging and simultaneous three-component PIV measurements are taken at 4\u00a0kHz. The upstream propagation of the flame occurs along a helical path around the center-body. For low-turbulence and high-swirl conditions (Reh\u00a0=\u00a04000, Swirl number\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.9), the lab-frame speed of the flame structure remains nearly constant during the period of investigation. Simultaneously, the leading side of the flame tongue retains its topology during propagation. The steady-state propagation behavior of the flame structure and stationarity of the flame topology allows us to make a frozen-flame-surface assumption. Applying space-time equivalence, the three-dimensional flame surface and flow field are reconstructed by shifting and stacking the time-series of the planar flame front profiles and the three-component planar velocity data. Further, the steady flow in the flame frame-of-reference provides a powerful means of investigating the flame-flow interaction. Quasi-pathlines are constructed in the unburnt and burnt regions of the flow field. The motion of the approach flow along a quasi-pathline is analyzed to understand the role of centrifugal and Coriolis forces. It is shown that the tug-of-war situation between Coriolis and centrifugal forces gets disrupted by the dilatation-driven blockage effect from the flame surface. It leads to a radial deflection of the approach flow, which results in reduction in the flame-normal approach flow speed, thereby assisting in the flame propagation. In the burnt gas, the Coriolis Effect bends the pathlines towards the center-body. We show - for the first time - that the azimuthal motion of the flame assists in the upstream propagation of the flame structure. Error assessment shows that the approximations made to construct the flame-surface and the flow-field retains the physics of flame-flow interactions.",

     "abstract": "The dynamics of a premixed ethylene-air jet injected transverse to a vitiated cross-flow were investigated using high-repetition rate particle image velocimetry (PIV). Both non-reacting and reacting jets were found to be characterized by a dominant frequency associated with the jet wake vortex system. For the isothermal jet, increasing the momentum flux ratio (J) has only a slight effect on the frequency of the oscillation but significantly increases its magnitude. The reacting jet was found to exhibit different behavior, with a monotonic increase in the dominant frequency with J. The jet equivalence ratio (\u03d5j) was found to have little effect on the rate of wake vortex shedding but affects the overall magnitude of the oscillation. Comparison with data reported in the literature suggests the relationship between the wake Strouhal number (Stw) and J is fuel dependent. Application of a vortex detection algorithm shows a stark difference in the location of the wake vortices under non-reacting and reacting conditions. Under isothermal conditions, the vortices are found close to the jet centerline and dissipate relatively quickly. Reaction confines the vortices to a narrow shear layer until a farther distance downstream and the vortices convect through the entire area of interest. Additionally, the vortex circulation strength was found to increase with J. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis of the non-reacting and reacting jets demonstrates the dominance of the wake vortex structures in the oscillating flow fields. In both cases, the temporal information extracted from the most energetic modes is identical to the dominant frequencies measured in the flow fields. The primary effect of heat release is to reduce the overall amount of coherence and to delay the appearance of elevated coherence levels until a larger streamwise distance from the jet exit.",

Jets composed of mixtures of hydrogen, helium and nitrogen were used to independently vary the momentum flux ratio (J), jet to crossflow density ratio (S) and heat release. Velocity fields were obtained from 10\u202fkHz high-speed stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) and regions of elevated temperature/combustion products from simultaneous OH planar laser induced fluorescence (OH-PLIF). The shear layer vortices (SLV) originating from instabilities in the windward and leeward shear layers were identified using vortex identification indicator functions in order to track their spatial location and strength. The results show that the asymmetries in shear layer strength between the windward and leeward shear layers are dependent primarily on J, for both reacting and non-reacting flow-fields. The SLV growth rate dependencies on J and S is found to match trends noted by previous studies for non-reacting jets, where SLV growth rates increase with degree of global instability of the JICF. Heat release is also shown to suppress the SLV growth rates relative to non-reacting cases with the same jet parameters. Related to this point, the degree of lifting of the flame also has a significant impact on SLV growth. As flame lifting is directly related to autoignition times, this point shows strong coupling between kinetic rates and jet hydrodynamic stability.",

Two representative test conditions are analyzed in detail: Flame 1 (F1) that presents longitudinal mode dynamics ( p \u2032 / p c = 3 % ) and Flame 2 (F2) that presents high amplitude transverse instabilities ( p \u2032 / p c = 15 % ) . Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) analysis indicate a strong correlation of both instabilities to flame-vortex interactions. Longitudinal mode instabilities are correlated with axisymmetric vortex shedding about the combustor axis that result in periodic axial variations in heat release at the 1L frequency. Transverse mode instabilities correspond to asymmetric vortex shedding pattern that drive transverse variations in heat release at the fundamental 1T frequency of the combustion chamber. The phase relationship of the flame emission intensity and the chamber head-end pressure measurement at the 1T frequency indicates presence of a non-stationary transverse mode that rotates about the chamber axis at 55\u00a0Hz.",

     "abstract": "This paper reports the effect of inlet flow turbulence intensity on the combustion instability characteristics in a backward facing step combustor. The inlet turbulence intensity is varied by a turbulence generator. Unsteady pressure measurements and OH* chemiluminescence images are recorded over a wide range of operating conditions at different inlet turbulence intensities. The study shows an early onset of instability at low turbulence level, i.e., higher turbulence postpones the onset of instability to higher Reynolds number Re and/or higher equivalence ratio \u03a6. The early onset of instability in the Re and \u03a6 parameter spaces is due to the change in system parameters such as flame speed and size of the recirculation zone downstream of the step at different turbulence levels. Further, the onset is characterized as subcritical bifurcation. At low Re, the hysteresis zone width is small for low turbulence levels and it is large at higher turbulence levels; and at higher Re, the hysteresis width remains constant at all turbulence levels. Investigation of instability characteristics reveals that there are momentary slippages from limit cycle orbit into brief silent regimes in an intermittent manner. The frequency of occurrence of the momentary silent regimes increases with reduction in turbulence, indicating that higher turbulence helps in maintaining the system in a stable limit cycle orbit. High-speed chemiluminescence imaging reveals the necessity of the vortex rollup in the recirculation zone to grow up to the top wall by dilatation from the heat release for the onset of instability. Considerations of the effect of turbulence on both the flame speed and the recirculation zone size together explain all the observed bifurcation trends. These results suggest that inlet flow turbulence should not just be considered as background noise. The turbulence effects on both the flame and flow should be considered in predicting the instability characteristics.",

The first flame is stabilized by a central bluff body without swirl, the second one by the same bluff body with the addition of swirl and the last one only by swirl without central insert. In the two last cases, the swirl level is roughly the same. These three flames feature different shapes and heat release distributions, but their Flame Transfer Function (FTF) feature about the same phase lag at low frequencies. The gain of the FTF also shows the same behavior for the flame stabilized by the central insert without swirl and the one fully aerodynamically stabilized by swirl. Shedding of vortical structures from the injector nozzle that grow and rollup the flame tip controls the FTF of these flames. The flame stabilized by the swirler-plus-bluff-body system features a peculiar response with a large drop of the FTF gain around a frequency at which large swirl number oscillations are observed. Velocity measurements in cold flow conditions reveal a strong reduction of the size of the vortical structures shed from the injector lip at this forcing condition. The flame stabilized aerodynamically only by swirl and the one stabilized by the bluff body without swirl do not exhibit any FTF gain drop at low frequencies. In the former case, large swirl number oscillations are still identified, but large vortical structures shed from the nozzle also persist at the same forcing frequency in the cold flow response. These different flame responses are found to be intimately related to the dynamics of the internal recirculation region, which response strongly differs depending upon the injector used to stabilize the flame.",

It is known, especially in the field of liquid rocket propulsion, that the pressure loss of an injector has an effect on its dynamics and on the coupling between the combustion chamber and the fuel manifold. However, its influence is not well documented in the technical literature dealing with gas turbine combustion dynamics. Effects of changes in this key design parameter are investigated in the present article by testing different swirlers at constant thermal power on a broad range of injection velocities in a well controlled laboratory scale single injector swirled combustor using liquid fuel. The objective is to study the impact of injection pressure losses on the occurrence and level of combustion instabilities by making use of a set of injectors having nearly the same outlet velocity profiles, the same swirl number and that establish flames that are essentially identical in shape. It is found that combustion oscillations appear on a wider range of operating conditions for injectors with the highest pressure loss, but that the pressure fluctuations caused by thermoacoustic oscillations are greatest when the injector head loss is low. Four types of instabilities coupled by two modes may be distinguished: the first group features a lower frequency, arises when the injector pressure loss is low and corresponds to a weakly coupled chamber-plenum mode. The second group appears in the form of a constant amplitude limit cycle, or as bursts at a slightly higher frequency and is coupled by a chamber mode. Spontaneous switching between these two types of instabilities is also observed in a narrow domain.",

In contrast to the existing literature, this review focuses on fundamental studies on both diagnostics and modelling aspects of bench- or lab-scale oxy-fuel combustion and, particularly, gives attention to the correlations among combustion characteristics, pollutant formation, and operational ash concerns. First, the influences of temperature and species concentrations (e.g., O2, H2O) on coal ignition, volatile combustion and char burning processes, for air- and oxy-firing, are comparatively evaluated and modelled, on the basis of data from optically-accessible set-ups including flat-flame burner, drop-tube furnace, and down-fired furnace. Then, the correlations of combustion-generated particulate/NOx emissions with changes of combustion characteristics in both air and oxy-fuel firing modes are summarized. Additionally, ash deposition propensity, as well as its relation to the formation of fine particulates (i.e. PM0.2, PM1 and PM10), for both modes are overviewed.

The Na* and K* emission signals follow the same trends of the CH* and C2* emission signals until the end of the volatiles combustion stage, beyond which, unlike the CH* and C2* emission signals, they persist owing to their release from the char burning particles. Moreover, during the volatiles combustion stage, the Na*/CH* and K*/CH* ratios present constant values for each biomass residue.

The results showed that O-containing species, N-containing species, chain hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the main products in the raw tar from the pyrolysis of PW, TP, PE and PVC, respectively. The tar cracking efficiency by ABC was ordered as PW>TP>PE>PVC, which indicated that the biomass tars were easier to be converted by ABC than plastic tars. The highest tar conversion of 98.7% was achieved for PW at 900\u00a0\u00b0C. Besides, N-containing tars were more stable than O-containing tars. The coke deposition on the ABC was more serious after the cracking of plastic tars (PE and PVC) than that of biomass tars (PW and TP). After the catalytic cracking of TP and PVC tars at 900\u00a0\u00b0C, the nitrogen and chlorine contents in ABC increased by 3 times and 10.5 times, respectively.",

     "abstract": "Combining polarizing-filtered planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) with simultaneous laser absorption, quantitative laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and two-color pyrometry, the potassium release during the combustion of biomass fuels (corn straw and poplar) has been investigated. The temporal release profiles of volatile atomic potassium and potassium compounds from a corn straw show a single peak. The woody biomass, poplar, produces a dual-maxima distribution for potassium and potassium compounds. For both biomass samples, the highest concentrations of released atomic potassium and potassium compounds occur in the devolatilization stage. The mass ratios between volatile atomic potassium and potassium compounds in the corn straw and poplar cases are 0.77% and 0.79%, respectively. These values agree well with chemical equilibrium predictions that 0.68% of total potassium will be in atomic form. A two-step kinetic model of potassium release has been developed, which gives better predictions during the devolatilization stage than the existing single-step model. Finally, a map of potassium transformation processes during combustion is developed. Starting with inorganic and organic potassium, there are eight proposed transformation pathways including five proposed release pathways that occur during the combustion. The pathways describe the transformation of potassium between the fuel volatile matter, char, and ash. Potassium release during the devolatilization stage is due to pyrolysis and evaporation; during the char burnout stage, potassium release is due to char oxidation and decomposition; and during the ash cooking stage, potassium release is caused by reactions between the ash and H2O in the co-flow.",

Understanding deposit formation, and developing modelling tools, will allow improvements in boiler efficiency and availability. In this study, deposit formation of a model biomass ash species (K2Si4O9) on steel tubes, was investigated in a lab-scale Entrained Flow Reactor. K2Si4O9 was injected into the reactor, to form deposits on an air-cooled probe, simulating deposit formation on superheater tubes in boilers. The influence of flue gas temperature (589 \u2013 968\u00b0C), probe surface temperature (300 \u2013 550\u00b0C), flue gas velocity (0.7 \u2013 3.5\u202fm/s), fly ash flux (10,000 \u2013 40,000\u202fg/m2h), and probe residence time (up to 60\u202fmin) was investigated. The results revealed that increasing flue gas temperature and probe surface temperature increased the sticking probability of the fly ash particles, thereby increasing the rate of deposit formation. However, increasing flue gas velocity resulted in a decrease in the deposit formation rate, due to increased particle rebound. Furthermore, the deposit formation rate increased with probe residence time and fly ash flux. Inertial impaction was the primary mechanism of deposit formation, forming deposits only on the upstream side of the steel tube. A mechanistic model was developed for predicting deposit formation in the reactor. Deposit formation by thermophoresis and inertial impaction was incorporated into the model, and the sticking probability of the ash particles was estimated by accounting for energy dissipation due to particle deformation. The model reasonably predicted the influence of flue gas temperature and fly ash flux on the deposit formation rate.",

The reactivities of the lignin pseudo-components are modelled through a series of lumped unidirectional reactions, whose product formation and reaction rate constants are optimised to replicate a comprehensive experimental dataset gathered from several works available in the literature. The new kinetic model contributes to the state-of-the-art by providing a more accurate depiction of the conversion rates, selectivity of char vs. volatiles, and aromatic composition in condensable products in line with the inherent reactivity of lignin functionalities and the empirical observations of lignin depolymerisation and thermal degradation at low (<1\u202fK/s) and high heating rates (>50\u202fK/s).",

     "abstract": "In this work, the effects of feedstock water leaching on ignition and PM1.0 emission during biomass combustion were studied, for the first time, in a Hencken flat-flame burner reactor (HFFBR). A high-speed video camera and high-resolution electrical low-pressure impactor were respectively employed to diagnose ignition and PM1.0 along the height of the burner. The mineral composition of PM10+ was measured as a function of height to demonstrate the potassium release during the early stage of biomass combustion. The results show that water leaching does not change the functional group of the biomass (straw), but increases the BET surface area and pore volume. Water leaching removes 90% of the potassium and all the chlorine, reducing the same amount of PM1.0 emission. The effect of water leaching on ignition delay observed in the flat-flame burner reactor agrees with the delay of biomass-devolatilization in TGA. Profiles of mineral composition in the PM10+ with height shows that a large amount of the potassium is released before biomass ignition. This indicates that, at realistic heating rates, the catalytic promotion of water-soluble minerals on biomass ignition is primarily through promoting devolatilization. The ignition delay of biomass particles caused by water leaching is more significant at lower temperature, e.g., ignition is delayed from 20 to 24\u202fms at 1000\u202f\u00b0C, and from 9.2 to 10.2\u202fms at 1300\u202f\u00b0C.",

Sludge samples, with or without acetates, were pyrolysed in a fix-bed reactor at 150\u2013550\u00a0\u00b0C, and the nitrogen species in the pyrolysis products (char, tar, and gas) were characterised and quantified. Ca and Na acetates distinctly affect nitrogen transformation during sludge pyrolysis, which is ascribable to their different catalytic activities for the decomposition of nitrogen species in sludge. The addition of Ca acetate is found to increase nitrogen retention in char and reduce the formation of nitrogen species in tar, which is mainly due to the suppressed decomposition of protein-N as well as the promoted formation of stable nitrogen species in char. On the other hand, the addition of Na acetate enhances the decomposition of nitrogen species in sludge, such as protein- and inorganic-N. The levels of both Ca and Na acetates are significantly reduced in the nitrogen-containing gas emissions because acetone is produced when acetates are heated, and acetone readily reacts with NH3 to produce binary clusters or amines. Our results show that acetate addition is an important strategy for the reduction of NH3 emission during sludge pyrolysis.",

The combustion experiments were conducted in a high temperature drop tube furnace (DTF) at 1400\u00a0\u00b0C to collect the inorganic PM10 for further analysis. Combustion atmosphere was air for all cases and 50% O2/50% CO2 (OXY50) for coal, T-260 and their blends of 1:1 and 4:1.

Reduction ratios of co-firing are overall higher at mix ratio of 1:1 than 4:1, and co-firing of T-260 or T-300 with coal shows higher reduction ratio than co-firing of straw. The higher ash content in torrefied straw leads to higher contents of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEM), which will further react with both Si and S during co-firing and coagulate into particles of larger sizes, leading to higher reduction ratios of PM0.3 and unconspicuous reduction effects in PM0.3\u20131 emitted from co-firing.

A considerable amount of water-soluble Ca and P in PM1 transforms to PM1\u201310 (particle size between 1\u201310\u202f\u00b5m). As a result, the production of PM1 (on an ash basis) decreases while that of PM1\u201310 increases.

It also introduces a 3-step quasi-global reaction scheme to describe the dynamic approach to ultimate soot yields for deployment in CFD furnace simulations, where the rate parameters are evaluated to match the predicted dynamics from a comprehensive tar conversion mechanism. The predicted ultimate soot yields are validated with measurements for coal ranks from brown coals to anthracites, for heating rates of at least several thousand degrees per second; temperatures from 900 to 1300\u00a0\u00b0C; and tar contact times from 75\u202fms through 14\u202fs. Primary tar, defined as the aggregate amount of all condensed aromatics from primary devolatilization, determines the ultimate soot yields from any coal at any operating conditions. Ultimate soot yields from any coal can be evaluated from the yield and FLASHCHAIN\u00ae-based elemental composition of primary tar as accurately as they have been measured. On average, only 18% of the primary tar mass is excluded from the ultimate soot product, which mostly reflects the exchange of C2H2 into soot for the CO that carries away tar-oxygen. This exchange nearly compensates for the much more extensive elimination of heteroatoms and aliphatics from tar during soot production. The proposed three-step global scheme accurately depicts the reaction dynamics for tar decomposition at elevated temperatures from the full tar decomposition mechanism, including the maximum and ultimate saturation value of secondary tar. Whereas the kinetic parameters for primary and secondary tar display the established tendencies for different operating conditions and coals, those for soot production are remarkably uniform across this domain.",

It expands the previously validated mechanism for tar decomposition based on FLASHCHAIN\u00ae theory to cover N-transformations during pulverized fuel firing. Tar-N transformations are described by two distinctive features: (1) An elimination reaction that produces HCN governs the decay in the average moles of nitrogen per aromatic nucleus throughout tar decomposition; and (2) Empirical observations determine the fraction of tar-N incorporated into soot. Validation cases represent heating rates of at least several thousand degrees per second; temperatures from 600 to 1100\u00a0\u00b0C; tar contact times from 75\u202fms through 2\u202fs; and coal ranks from subbituminous through low volatile bituminous. The predicted partitioning of coal-N into tar-N, HCN, soot-N, and char-N was within measurement uncertainties for all coals for simulated p. f. firing conditions, including the variation in fractional char-N levels from 0.4 to 0.8 across this domain. Since primary tar-N levels are directly proportional to fractional primary tar yields, and since ultimate soot-N levels account for one-third of tar-N with any coal type, the ultimate coal-N partitioning for CFD furnace simulations can be accurately described with two analyses: (1) A primary devolatilization mechanism to predict primary tar yields under rapid heating conditions; and (2) A submechanism to predict HCN release from char throughout devolatilization up to the point of char ignition. Dynamics may be resolved with either global reactions or the full tar decomposition mechanism, depending on the impact of the lag between tar decomposition and soot production in the subject application.",

     "abstract": "This paper as the first time in the field reports the direct experimental evidence for demonstrating the important role of cooling in ash cenosphere fragmentation using a simple but unique combustion system. The combustion system used pulverised pyrite (38\u201345\u00a0\u00b5m) for combustion in drop-tube furnace under designed conditions (gas temperature: 1000\u00a0\u00b0C; residence time: 1.2\u00a0s), which produced dominantly ash cenosphere particles or fragments. The combustion products were quenched under various cooling conditions (represented by nominal cooling rates of 6400\u201311,800\u00a0\u00b0C/s) for sampling. The results show that increasing cooling rate from 6400 to 11,800\u00a0\u00b0C/s substantially intensifies ash cenosphere fragmentation. Such enhanced ash cenosphere fragmentation leads to a significant shift in the particle size distribution of ash collected in the cyclone (>10\u00a0\u00b5m) to much smaller sizes. It also produces considerably more particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic sizes less than 10\u00a0\u00b5m (i.e., PM10) that consists of dominantly PM with aerodynamic sizes between 1 and 10\u00a0\u00b5m (i.e., PM1\u201310) and some PM with aerodynamic sizes less than 1\u00a0\u00b5m (i.e., PM1). It is further noted that the PM1 is mainly PM with aerodynamic sizes between 0.1 and 1\u00a0\u00b5m (i.e., PM0.1\u20131) and to a considerably lesser extent PM with aerodynamic sizes less than 0.1\u00a0\u00b5m (i.e., PM0.1).

     "abstract": "During coal combustion, char chemical reaction is the slowest step, particularly in the last burnout stage, where the char consists of small amounts of carbon in a predominant ash framework. Existing kinetics models tend to deviate from experimental measurements of late char burnout due to the incomplete treatment of ash effects. Ash can improve pore evolution through vaporization, hinder oxygen transport by forming an ash film, and reduce active carbon sites and available surface per unit volume by penetrating into the char matrix. In this work, a sophisticated kinetics model, focusing on these three ash evolution mechanisms (ash vaporization, ash film, and ash dilution) during pulverized coal (PC) char combustion, is developed by integrating them into a thorough mechanistic picture. Further, a detailed comparison of the three distinct ash effects on PC char conversion during air (O2/N2) and oxy-fuel (O2/CO2) combustion is performed. For the modeled coal, the mass of ash vaporization is approximate 3 orders less than the mass of ash remaining, which participates in ash dilution and ash film formation, both in O2/N2 and O2/CO2 atmospheres. The influence of these phenomena on burnout time follows the order: ash dilution > ash film > ash vaporization. The influence of ash vaporization on burnout time is minor, but through interactions with the ash dilution and ash film forming processes it can have an impact at high extents of burnout, particularly in O2/CO2 atmospheres. In O2/N2 atmospheres the residual ash predominately exists as an ash film, whereas it mainly exists as diluted ash in the char matrix in O2/CO2 atmospheres. The residual ash particle is encased by a thick film when the ash film forming fraction is high (low ash dilution fraction). These results provide in-depth insights into the conversion of PC char and further utilization of the residual ash.",

Two coal samples, a rhenish lignite and a coal manufactured from hydrothermal carbonization, were chosen for this investigation due to their similar classification but different molecular structures. For both samples, our measurements show a two-stage devolatilization phase separated by a char-oxidation phase which can be attributed to the interaction of oxygen consumption in the gas phase and on the surface and the release of volatiles from deeper layers of the plate. Furthermore, detailed speciation data of light, oxygenated, and tar species allowed to identify fuel structure-specific decomposition patterns of the two different coal materials, thus providing comprehensive data that can be used for future model validation purposes.",

     "abstract": "Pyrite (FeS2) oxidation during coal combustion is one of the main sources of harmful SO2 emission from coal-fired power plants. Density functional theory (DFT) study was performed to uncover the evolution mechanism of SOx formation during pyrite oxidation. The results show that chemisorption mechanism is responsible for O2, SO2 and SO3 adsorption on FeS2 surface. The presence of formed oxidation layer (Fe2O3) weakens the interaction between O2 molecule and FeS2 surface. The adsorbed O2 molecule easily dissociates into active surface O atom for SOx formation. The dissociation reaction of O2 is activated by 77.38\u202fkJ/mol, and exothermic by 138.46\u202fkJ/mol. Compared to the further oxidation of SO2 into SO3, SO2 prefers to desorb from FeS2 surface. The dominant reaction pathway of SO2 formation from the oxidation of the outermost FeS2 surface layer is a three-step process: surface lattice S oxidation, SO2 desorption and replenishment of S vacancy by activated surface O atom. The elementary reaction of surface lattice S oxidation has an activation energy barrier of 197.96\u202fkJ/mol, and is identified as the rate-limiting step. SO2 formation from the further oxidation of bulk FeS2 layer is controlled by a four-step process: bulk lattice S migration, lattice S oxidation, SO2 desorption and surface O atom deposition.

We observed an explosion-like fragmentation of Zhundong coal in the early devolatilization stage by means of high-speed photography in the Hencken flat-flame burner. While high ash-fusion (HAF) bituminous and coal-derived char samples only undergo gentle perimeter fragmentation in the char burning stage. Simultaneously, combustion experiments of two kinds of coals were conducted in a 25\u202fkW down-fired combustor. The particle size distributions (PSDs) of both fine particulates (PM1-10) and bulk fly ash (PM10+) were measured by Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI) and Malvern Mastersizer 2000, respectively. The results show that the mass PSD of residual fly ash (PM1+) from Zhundong coal exhibits a bi-modal shape with two peaks located at 14\u202f\u00b5m and 102\u202f\u00b5m, whereas that from HAF coal only possesses a single peak at 74\u202f\u00b5m. A hybrid model accounting for multiple-route ash formation processes is developed to predict the PSD of fly ash during coal combustion. By incorporating coal/char fragmentation sub-models, the simulation can quantitatively reproduce the measured PM1+ PSDs for different kinds of coals. The sensitivity analysis further reveals that the bi-modal mass distribution of PM1+ intrinsically results from the coal fragmentation during devolatilization.",

Liquid antimony/antimony oxide served as the intermediate medium for coal oxidation producing mainly carbon dioxide, which evolved as a separate gas stream. The fuel cell will facilitate carbon capture process, and simultaneously convert the chemical energy of coal directly to electricity. The experiment showed that while the fabricated electrolyte was porous, it became dense during the actual operation, preventing nitrogen leakage into the Sb/C side and producing reasonable open circuit voltage. Analysis of the experimental EIS data illustrates that the Ohmic resistance was the primary loss mechanism in the system. It further suggests approaches to improve the design.

After pyrolysis of a high volatiles Colombian coal in CO2 atmosphere in a drop tube reactor at 1573\u202fK, solid carbonaceous particles of different size, from 100\u202f\u00b5m of the particle feed down to the nanometric size, have been observed. A fragmentation model has been used to predict the fate of Colombian coal particles under the experimental conditions of the drop tube experiment and predict the particle size distribution (PSD). Model and experimental results are in very good agreement and indicate that in the DTR experiment the coal underwent almost complete pyrolysis and that fragmentation generated a 36\u202fwt% population of particles with size close to 30\u202f\u00b5m. The close match between the PSDs obtained from experiments and from the fragmentation model is an important novelty. It demonstrates that fragmentation occurs not only under fluidized bed conditions but also under the conditions of pulverized coal combustion. Experimentalists are warned against the fact that the fine particulate sampled at the outlet of laminar flow reactors and boilers is not always composed of soot only.

     "abstract": "In this study, the effects of mechanical stresses on the shedding of ash deposits in a coal-fired boiler were evaluated. We have confirmed that the shedding occurred because of the fracture within the initial deposit layer, which was formed by powdered ash residues. Therefore, assuming that the mechanical stress acting on the initial layer influenced the shedding, the distribution of the tensile stress and shear stresses acting on the initial deposit was calculated on the basis of elastic mechanism. Because the ash deposits were brittle in nature, it was assumed that the initial deposit failed on the basis of the maximum principal stress theory (MPST). The stress values were calculated based on the data for deposit shapes, which were obtained through previous ash deposition experiments on two bituminous coals, one subbituminous coal, and two lignite coals. The fracture strength of the deposit increased with a decrease in the ash fusion temperature. This result indicated that the strength of the deposit increased because of ash coalescence. Moreover, as the MPST, the starting point of fracture was estimated from the position where the principal stress became the largest, and the stress value was used to presume whether the fracture depended on tensile stress or shear stress. The deposit with a narrow adherence region failed because of tensile stress, and the signature of peeling due to tensile stress was observed in the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the deposit after ash shedding. In contrast, the deposit with a wide adherence region failed because of shear stress. Therefore, peeling was not observed in the cross-sectional SEM image of the deposit after ash shedding. The results obtained from the analysis on the basis of the MPST well with the actual behavior of ash shedding.",

Hashimoto et al., Combust. Flame 159 (2012) 353\u2013366]. This model enables to take into account the effect of coal particle heating rate on coal pyrolysis. The coal-derived soot formation model proposed by Brown and Fletcher [A. L. Brown and T. H. Fletcher, Energy Fuels 12 (1998) 745\u2013757] was employed in the LES. A comparison between the data predicted by LES and the soot volume fraction distribution data measured by laser induced incandescence confirmed that the soot formation characteristics in the coal combustion field of the CRIEPI burner can be accurately predicted by LES. A detailed analysis of the data predicted by LES showed that the soot particle distribution in this burner is narrow because the net soot formation rate is negative on both sides of the base of the soot volume fraction. At these positions, soot particles diffused from the peak position of soot volume fraction are oxidized due to a relatively high oxygen concentration. Finally, the effect of soot radiation on the predicted gas temperature distribution was examined by comparing the simulation results obtained with and without soot radiation. This comparison showed that the maximum gas temperature predicted by the simulation performed with soot radiation was over 100\u00a0K lower than that predicted by the simulation performed without soot radiation. From result strongly suggests the importance of considering a soot formation model for performing numerical simulations of a pulverized-coal combustion filed.",

The thermo-chemical quantities in the char surface reaction zone cannot be correctly predicted if the mixing between the char off-gas stream and other streams is neglected. For the piloted jet flame, it was shown that the stable thermo-chemical variables can be correctly predicted at the upper and middle stream locations.

     "abstract": "The alumina content (more than 40%) of high-alumina coal ash is comparative to the middle content bauxite ores in China. So far, in order to meet the high demand of alumina and the rise of circular economy industrial chain, extracting alumina from coal ash has become a way to comprehensively utilize high-alumina coal ash. However, this process has high requirements on the crystal phase and stability of alumina. Different from most studies, this paper focuses on how to produce coal ash more beneficial to the later refining of aluminum. Therefore, the effects of combustion temperature and coal types by classifying high-alumina coal into dull coal and bright coal on alumina crystal phase formation were studied. Through proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, calorific value analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) and other methods, it is found that \u03b3-Al2O3 in high-alumina coal ash translated into more stable \u03b8-Al2O3 and finally \u03b1-Al2O3 when combustion temperature is higher than 1000\u00b0C. Thus compared with pulverized coal boilers, circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers with lower combustion temperature can produce higher quality coal ash. Moreover, at the same combustion temperature, alumina crystal phase in dull coal ash is relatively less stable than that in bright coal ash, which is more suitable to the later refining and electrolysis of aluminum.",

The configuration consists of a carrier-gas stream of air laden with coal particles that mixes with an oxidizer stream of hot products from lean combustion. Carrier-phase DNS (CP-DNS) are performed, where the turbulent flow field is fully resolved, whereas the coal is represented by Lagrangian point particles. CP-DNS with direct chemistry integration is performed first and provides state-of-the-art validation data for FPV modeling. In a second step the control variables for FPV are extracted from the CP-DNS and used to test if the tabulated manifold can correctly describe the reacting flow (a priorianalysis). Finally a fully coupled a posteriori FPV simulation is performed, where only the FPV control variables are transported, and the chemical state is retrieved from the table and fed back to the flow solver. The a priori results show that the FPV approach is suitable for modeling the complex reacting multiphase flow considered here. The a posteriori data is similarly in good agreement with the reference CP-DNS, although stronger deviations than a priori can be observed. These discrepancies mainly appear in the upper flame (of the present DNS), where premixing and highly unsteady extinction and re-ignition effects play a role, which are difficult to capture by steady non-premixed FPV modeling. However, the present FPV model accurately captures the lower, more stable flame that burns in non-premixed mode.",

It is a promising method to use sorbents for the capture of arsenic vapors (As2O3(g)) before As-containing flue gas entering SCR catalyst. However, arsenic has a strong affinity with sulfur in coal and SO2 in the coal combustion flue gas strongly suppresses As2O3(g) capture by typical Ca/Fe-based sorbents. This study estimated the selective capture of As2O3(g) by \u03b3-Al2O3 and the effects of SO2 and NO on the arsenic adsorption were investigated. The results showed that As2O3(g) adsorption over \u03b3-Al2O3 was effectively conducted at temperatures ranging from 300 to 400 \u00b0C. In the reacted \u03b3-Al2O3, arsenic was predominantly in the form of As3+ through reactions with Al-O bonds and positive charged alumina ions. SO2 was slightly adsorbed on \u03b3-Al2O3, which had a limited effect on arsenic adsorption. The adsorption of SO2 on \u03b3-Al2O3 mainly occurred on the sites of hydroxyl groups (Al-OH) and few adsorbed SO2 was bound with positive charged alumina ions. NO was catalytically oxidized by \u03b3-Al2O3 and released as NO2. Nevertheless, NO competed with As2O3(g) to adhere to positive charged alumina ions and strongly suppressed arsenic adsorption over \u03b3-Al2O3. Fortunately, in the presence of SO2, NO was mostly transformed into intermediate (-SO3NO) at the sites of Al-OH on \u03b3-Al2O3. As a result, the adverse effect of NO on the adsorption of As2O3(g) was weakened.",

For each solid fuel, particles were burned at a constant drop tube furnace wall temperature of 1475\u202fK, in six different mixtures of O2/N2/CO2/H2O, which allowed simulating dry and wet conventional and oxy-fuel combustion conditions. A high-speed camera was used to record the ignition process and the collected images were treated to characterize the ignition mode (either gas-phase or surface mode) and to calculate the ignition delay times. The Colombian coal particles ignite predominately in the gas-phase for all test conditions, but under simulated oxy-fuel conditions there is a decrease in the occurrence of this ignition mode; the charcoal particles experience surface ignition regardless of the test condition; and the Brazilian coal particles ignite predominately in the gas-phase when combustion occurs in mixtures of O2/N2/H2O, but under simulated oxy-fuel conditions the ignition occurs predominantly on the surface. The ignition delay times for particles that ignited in the gas-phase are smaller than those that ignited on the surface, and generally the simulated oxy-fuel conditions retard the onset of both gas-phase and surface ignition. The addition of steam decreases the gas-phase and surface ignition delay times of the particles of both coals under simulated oxy-fuel conditions, but has a small impact on the gas-phase ignition delay times when the combustion occurs in mixtures of O2/N2/H2O. The steam gasification reaction is likely to be responsible for the steam effect on the ignition delay times through the production of highly flammable species that promote the onset of ignition.",

The method is useful when combustion is controlled by external mass transfer, commonly encountered in large-scale processes. The viability of this method has been demonstrated experimentally with graphite and a lignite char. It was found that in an atmosphere of \u223c 1% O2, the graphite produced CO2 between 700 and 900\u00a0\u00b0C whilst the lignite char produced a mixture of CO and CO2 between 700 and 800\u00a0\u00b0C with the proportion of CO increasing with temperature, and above 850\u00a0\u00b0C, only CO was produced.

A model has been developed in order to predict the particle sticking efficiency for fly ash deposition at high temperatures. The model incorporates the particle properties relevant to the ash chemistry, particle kinetic energy and furnace operation conditions and takes into consideration the partial sticking behaviour and the deposit layer. To test the model, the sticking behaviours of synthetic ash in a drop tube furnace are evaluated and the slagging formation from coal combustion in a down-fired furnace is modelled. Compared with the measurements, the proposed model presents reasonable prediction performance on the particle sticking behaviour and the ash deposition formation. Through a sensitivity analysis, furnace operation conditions (velocity and temperature), contact angle and particle size have been found to be the significant factors in controlling the sticking behaviours for the synthetic ash particles. The ash chemistry and furnace temperature dictate the wetting potential of the ash particles and the melting ability of the deposit surface; particle size and density not only control the particle kinetic energy, but also affect the particle temperature. The furnace velocity condition has been identified as being able to influence the selective deposition behaviour, where the maximum deposition efficiency moves to smaller particles when increasing the gas velocity. In addition, the thermophoresis effect on the arrival rate of the particles reduces with increasing the gas velocity. Further, increasing the melting degree of the deposit layer could greatly enhance the predicted deposition formation, in particular for the high furnace velocity condition.",

To better understand the pyrolysis mechanism, we herein employed generalized two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy (2D-PCIS) to analyze the functional group evolution in bamboo chars between 250 and 600\u00a0\u00b0C, and by combination of the volatile release properties, the biomass pyrolysis process mechanism was speculated. We found that below 250\u00a0\u00b0C, the hydrogen bonding network within the biomass macromolecular structure was broken, while at 250\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C, the branched structures were broken during hydration and decarboxylation reactions, resulting in the formation of H2O, acetic acids, and CO2. The subsequent formation of various phenols between 300 and 350\u00a0\u00b0C mainly originated from rupture of the ether bridges in the lignin structure. In addition, molecular rearrangement of the intermediates from the decomposition of holocellulose resulted in aromatic ring formation. Interestingly, analysis by 2D-PCIS demonstrated that the aromatic rings bearing adjacent substituents easily formed double active sites following breakage of the branched structures. These structures then easily produced fused ring systems below 400\u00a0\u00b0C, while dehydrogenation and polycondensation at\u202f>\u202f400\u00a0\u00b0C promoted the formation of fused rings from aromatic rings without adjacent substituents.",

     "abstract": "The Boudouard reaction is an important heterogeneous reaction that takes place inside the gasifier during char gasification. To evaluate the gasification performance of solid fuels, it is important to know the intrinsic rate of the Boudouard reaction of that particular fuel. Incorrect determination of this rate results in error when used for modelling or gasifier scaling purposes. The thermo-gravimetric analyser (TGA) is an instrument that is widely used for gasification studies, particularly to explore the intrinsic gasification kinetics of coal or biomass char in a controlled environment. As in a real gasifier environment, several experimental parameters in TGA experiments can influence the intrinsic reactivity of the sample char; however, this is rarely discussed in the literature. It is essential to carefully differentiate the physical effects from the pure chemical reaction and to consider their interactions to obtain reliable kinetic parameters. No systematic experimental procedures to minimize the effects of the rate-influencing parameters during TGA experiments are available in the literature. This article presents an analysis for this purpose and demonstrates the variation in the gasification rate when the experimental conditions are not properly optimized. A mathematical model is also presented to explain the possible diffusional interactions with chemical kinetics during un-optimized TGA experiments.",

However, under lower temperature, a tiny layer of B2O3 can be generated at the surface of the (BO)n and form a three-layer structure during the ignition process, which has been proven by experimental phenomenon. Accordingly, a parameter xo is adopted to represent the thickness of the outer B2O3(l) layer (outermost layer), and a simplified kinetic and diffusion model for the ignition process of boron particles in dry and wet atmosphere is developed with considering the generation and consumption process of the outermost layer. The ignition process is divided into two parts (ignition delay and first-stage combustion) by the parameter xo. The ignition temperature is defined as the particle temperature at the moment that xo reaches 0. When xo\u202f>\u202f0, the particle is under the ignition delay process, and the evaporation product is B2O3(g). When xo\u202f=\u202f0, the particle turns to the first-stage combustion process. (BO)n is exposed to the environment, the evaporation products are B2O2(g) and B2O3(g), and the particle is under the two-layer structure. The oxygen diffusion inward is available during these two processes. The ignition time which is predicted by this model is in good agreement with published experimental data. Under a real ramjet condition, higher ambient temperature and concentration of water vapor can reduce both the maximum value of xo and the ignition time. The ignition temperature decreases with higher water vapor concentration, but increases with the higher ambient temperature.",

Dealing with fluorescence interference suitably is one of the key tasks before efficient application of Raman spectroscopy in coal assessment. In this study, Raman spectra and coal combustion characteristics of 32 kinds of Chinese coals were respectively obtained in a micro-Raman spectrometer and Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer. The degree of fluorescence interference in Raman spectrum was firstly defined and quantified as the drift coefficient \u03b1 using a simple method without curve-fitting the spectrum. The correlations between the degree of fluorescence interference and coal property, coal combustion characteristics were set up and multivariable analysis was done. The results indicate that the degree of fluorescence interference is well related to the coal structures, and it is synthetically determined by volatile, moisture and ash content in coal. With the increase of volatile, moisture content in coal, the fluorescence interference increases continuously, and it can be reduced but not eliminated by drying the moisture in coals. Significant mathematical relations between the drift coefficient \u03b1 and volatile, moisture content, coal combustion characteristic temperatures have been found. Coal with more evident fluorescence interference in Raman spectrum usually has lower degree of coalification, more polar functional groups, and burns at a lower temperature. The drift coefficient \u03b1 can act as an efficient probe for coal property and coal combustion characteristics.

The resulting conversion data were analyzed using the random pore model and the shrinking core model, of which the random pore model provided the best fit. Apparent activation energies were calculated using the random pore model which provided values ranging from 57.1\u00a0kJ/mol to 129\u00a0kJ/mol which are nominally half of the magnitude of the values reported in the literature under kinetically controlled conditions, thus demonstrating that regime II conditions were present. Additionally, the activation energies decreased with increasing temperature further demonstrating the presence of regime II conditions.

These kinetic rates quantify the char burning rate based on the temperature of the particle and the oxygen concentration at the external particle surface, inherently neglecting the impact of variations in the internal diffusion rate and penetration of oxygen. To investigate the impact of bulk gas diffusivity on these phenomena during Zone II burning conditions, experimental measurements were performed of char particle combustion temperature and burnout for a subbituminous coal burning in an optical entrained flow reactor with helium and nitrogen diluents. The combination of much higher thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity in the helium environments resulted in cooler char combustion temperatures than in equivalent N2 environments. Measured char burnout was similar in the two environments for a given bulk oxygen concentration but was approximately 60% higher in helium environments for a given char combustion temperature. To augment the experimental measurements, detailed particle simulations of the experimental conditions were conducted with the SKIPPY code. These simulations also showed a 60% higher burning rate in the helium environments for a given char particle combustion temperature. To differentiate the effect of enhanced diffusion through the external boundary layer from the effect of enhanced diffusion through the particle, additional SKIPPY simulations were conducted under selected conditions in N2 and He environments for which the temperature and concentrations of reactants (oxygen and steam) were identical on the external char surface. Under these conditions, which yield matching apparent char burning rates, the computed char burning rate for He was 50% larger, demonstrating the potential for significant errors with the apparent kinetics approach. However, for specific application to oxy-fuel combustion in CO2 environments, these results suggest the error to be as low as 3% when applying apparent char burning rates from nitrogen environments.",

     "abstract": "By using the concept of weighted sum of four gray particles and spectrum k-distribution (WSGP-SK), a non-gray radiative property model for unburnt char particles is developed. Based on the carbon burnout kinetic model for structure during oxidation, and the linear mixed approximation theory for complex index of refraction, spectral radiative properties of unburnt char particles are first calculated as function of the burnout ratio by Mie theory. Referring to the full spectrum k-distribution model, k-distribution is applied to reorder absorption and scattering efficiencies of particles. Then, weighting factors and efficiency factors of the non-gray radiative property model are directly obtained from Gaussian integral points of k-distribution. The model is validated against the benchmark solutions of line-by-line (LBL) model. Maximum relative errors of this model are 3% and 15% for radiative heat fluxes and source terms in non-isothermal inhomogeneous particulate media, respectively. The assumption of linearly varying radiative properties with burnout ratio (Lockwood et\u00a0al. 1986) will result in a predicted deviation of 53% for radiative source terms. Results also show that this non-gray model is remarkably better than the Planck mean method. Moreover, a satisfactory comparison with LBL solutions is achieved in the gas and particle mixture by combining the non-gray WSGG-SK model (Guo et\u00a0al. 2015). As a radiation sub-model, this non-gray radiative property model can significantly improve prediction accuracy of radiative heat transfer in oxy-fuel combustion.",

The method applies packed-bed reactor coupled with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to quantitate the ignition temperature under typical fuel-rich conditions, in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to elucidate the formation of environmentally-persistent free radicals (EPFR), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to monitor the chemisorption of organic substrates on the nanoparticles, as well as X-ray diffraction for particles characterisation (PXRD).

The sludge underwent thermal pyrolysis first and then catalytic pyrolysis. During the thermal pyrolysis, chain hydrocarbons were first cracked and further polymerized into aromatics. The effect of temperatures (400\u2013800\u00a0\u00b0C) on the products was investigated and the maximum liquid yield (67.7%) was obtained at 500\u00a0\u00b0C. High temperature promoted polymerization, thus the distribution of aromatics in the liquid product was increased and was more concentrated in polyaromatics at 800\u00a0\u00b0C. In the catalytic upgrading stage, dolomite was used as catalyst and aromatics were adsorbed on it, either aggregated or decomposed. As a result, a light oil product with 57.0% saturates was obtained at the residence time of 8.9\u202fs due to the conversion of aromatics and heavy hydrocarbons into light aliphatic hydrocarbons such as straight chain hydrocarbons. Compared with the oil phase in the raw sludge sample, the content of saturates was increased by 45.0% and that of the asphaltenes was reduced by 88.5%. Meanwhile, the inherent moisture in the oily sludge could participate in the steam reforming reaction, promoting the decomposition of aromatics and leading to an increase in the H2 generation. Moreover, the release of H2S was reduced from 0.132 to 0.005\u202fmol per kg sludge and the sulfur content of the oil product was also decreased in the presence of dolomite. The deactivation of dolomite can be attributed to the carbonization of CaO and deposition of polyaromatic coke on the catalyst surface.",

A CaO catalyst prepared from organic calcium compounds (Org-CaO) was first used to upgrade the pyrolysis oil of Jatropha curcas seeds in situ. Calcium d-gluconate monohydrate, calcium citrate tetrahydrate, and calcium acetate hydrate were employed as the organic precursors in this work. The results showed that Org-CaO exhibited better deoxygenation ability to produce more hydrocarbons than conventional CaO derived from Ca(OH)2 (CHCaO). Acids accounted for 83% of the oxygenated compounds in the raw bio-oil and were almost completely removed via CaO. For bio-oil catalyzed by Org-CaO, the fraction of esters in the oxygenated compounds was only \u223c9%, which was 20% less than that in CHCaO bio-oil. The relative content of ketones and alcohols in Org-CaO bio-oil increased by 16% versus that in CHCaO bio-oil. Org-CaO exhibited a remarkably larger pore size and much smaller particle sizes. Thus, Org-CaO entered into the fuel through the pore channels, and this promoted the formation of chemical crosslinking points between CaO and oxygenated groups. In addition, the basicity and the amount of basic sites for Org-CaO increased versus CHCaO. Thus, the adsorption forms of oxygen-containing groups in the bio-oil on the basic sites of CaO changed: the carboxyl groups were removed from the acids and were absorbed in a stable form of unidentate carbonate on oxygen vacancies (O2\u2212). The stable form was bidentate carbonate on Ca2+\u2013O2\u2212. In addition, oxygen vacancies on Org-CaO extracted more hydroxyl groups from the acids, resulting in dehydroxylation of acids to form ketones and alcohols.",

The distance between the LEFs anchored over the lamina interface edges of sandwiches is measured from the combustion images captured under high spatio-temporal resolution. Similarly, the extent of binder melt flow is also measured from the quenched surfaces of sandwiches. The burning rate experiments are performed as well on sandwiches with different middle lamina contents and thicknesses at pressures of 2, 4 and 7\u00a0MPa. Two different curing agents are considered to examine the melt flow behaviour of the binder. The curing agent significantly influences the inter-LEF distance mainly in the case of pure binder sandwiches, however, its effect is negligible in aluminized binder sandwiches because of the presence of Al particles that impedes the flow to appreciable extent. Substantial protrusion of the middle lamina relative to the lamina interfaces is observed in micro-aluminized binder sandwiches due to significant accumulation of Al particles on the burning surface. In the case of nano-aluminized binder sandwiches, such protrusion is relatively marginal since nano-Al particles burn quickly, which enables the gas phase flame to locate close to the burning surface, although the extent of Al accumulation is considerably more than in the former case. This causes the nano-aluminized binder sandwiches as a whole to burn significantly faster than the other two cases in the pressure range (<7\u00a0MPa) where the LEFs predominantly control the sandwich burning rates.",

     "abstract": "The effective solid propellant burning rate in a rocket depends on surface area and propellant composition. Currently, the surface area geometry in a rocket is limited to what can be practically cast using molds, etc. Additive manufacturing (AM) could allow the production of unique propellant grain geometries, however printing propellants with high solids loadings and viscosities is not readily possible using currently available printers. A new AM direct write system developed recently in our laboratory, is capable of printing visibly low-void propellants with high end mix viscosities into highly resolved geometries. The system was used to print ammonium perchlorate (AP) composite propellants at 85% solids loading using hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and a UV-curable polyurethane binder. The change in HTPB propellant viscosity with time after mixing was measured and the microstructure of the strands was evaluated with X-ray tomography scans. The burning rate of printed and cast strands was measured to compare the quality of the strands at high pressure, since propellants with significant voids should catastrophically fail due to flame spreading. The printed samples burned in a planar fashion up to pressures of 10.34\u202fMPa with consistent rates that were comparable to the cast propellants. The HTPB propellant used was not optimized and showed some porosity due to gas generation, but strands printed with the UV binder exhibited extremely low porosity. A strand printed with no gaps in one half and gaps in the other failed catastrophically where intended at high pressure, demonstrating the ability to spatially grade propellants. This new system can produce adequate strands of composite propellant with high solids loadings without the addition of solvents, special binders (low viscosity, thermal softening, etc.), or restricting use to formulations with lower viscosities, and enables the fabrication of complex propellant grain geometries.",

     "abstract": "In a context of growing concerns over climate change, aluminum has the potential to serve as a dense energy carrier in order to replace fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gases emissions. Indeed, its combustion in air may provide carbon-free energy for applications in which a high-energy storage capacity is required. However, attempts of designing a metal-fueled combustor will conflict with a relatively large dispersion of the burning velocity values reported in the literature, even when similar powders are used. This uncertainty is partially due to the range of experimental conditions and techniques used on those previous studies. In the present work, an experimental Bunsen-type aluminum-air burner is introduced. It is shown that the setup is capable of generating stable dust suspensions under well-controlled conditions. The stabilized aluminum-air flames are studied using emission spectroscopy, Particle Image Velocimetry, laser sheet tomography, and direct visualization of the AlO(g) emissions. The measured burning velocities are then compared to previous results obtained for similar powders as a function of dust concentration. A reasonable agreement is obtained, and it is shown that metal flame tomography can yield a more precise indicator of the flame front position than AlO(g) emissions, helping to reduce the data scatter regarding dust-air burning velocities.",

Non-aluminized AP-HTPB propellants of 86% particulate loading are used to illustrate the technique. Elemental maps of unburnt and extinguished propellant surface are obtained using EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy). Overlap between the elements is identified and the elemental maps are processed to calculate AP and binder area exposed in unburnt and extinguished samples. The AP area exposed is found to be around 72.3% and 63.3% for unburnt and extinguished samples, respectively, indicating a reduction in AP exposed area with extinguished samples. This has been attributed to the binder melt discussed in literature but never quantified. Simulations have been carried out to analyze and understand the effects of this binder melt. A random packing algorithm is used to simulate propellant packs. Also, a methodology to account for binder melt layer is introduced and is used to capture AP exposed areas. Effect of binder melt in propellants with different solid loading and varying particle size is discussed. It is shown that fine AP particles are more prone to being covered by binder melt than the coarse AP particles.

     "abstract": "Silica and titania nanoparticles were included at mass loadings of 1% and 3% in aqueous HAN propellants to evaluate their effects on liquid- and gas-phase decomposition and combustion. Both the liquid-phase and overall burning rates of propellant formulations were indirectly measured in a constant-volume strand burner filled with Argon from pressures of 3\u201322\u202fMPa using a novel, pressure-based method developed by the authors in recent work. This approach provides overall burn times for propellants such as aqueous HAN which continue to burn beyond the disappearance of the liquid, making it superior to methods based solely on visual observation which only monitor the liquid surface regression. The presence of silica nanoparticles increased the liquid-phase burning rate in the low- and medium-pressure regimes (<10\u202fMPa) and increased the overall burning rate at all pressures evaluated. The maximum amount of burning rate enhancement was realized at the lowest evaluated pressure (3\u202fMPa) which corresponded to 80% and 670% increases in the liquid-phase and overall burning rates, respectively, for a silica loading of 1%, and 160% and 830% increases in the liquid-phase and overall burning rates, respectively, for a silica loading of 3%. The presence of titania did not measurably affect the liquid-phase burning rate, but it did increase the overall burning rate in the low-pressure regime (<5.7\u202fMPa). This low-pressure overall burning rate enhancement was not amplified by further titania loading from 1% to 3% and was maximized at the lowest evaluated pressure (3\u202fMPa) which corresponded to a 500% increase in the overall burning rate. The observed enhancements of the propellant's liquid-phase and overall burning rates were attributed to the presence of catalytic processes which diminish at higher pressures.

In order to analyze more deeply the confined combustion of magnesium under fluctuating overpressure conditions (0 to 24\u00a0hPa) and the generated gaseous by-products, magnesium/air flames have been realized in a combustion chamber with a conical bluff-body as flame holder and different contraction ratios diaphragms at the exit duct. Sieved magnesium samples with two size-fractions were tested: 20\u201350\u202f\u00b5m and 50\u201370\u202f\u00b5m. The gaseous emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dioxygen (O2) were analyzed with on-line infrared, ultraviolet and paramagnetic analyzers. A flame pulsating behavior was clearly observed from light emission intensity (monitored by a photodiode) and pressure fluctuations (monitored by a pressure sensor); the frequencies obtained ranged between 3 and 10\u202fHz. The frequency of the pulsation exhibited strong dependence on the geometric configuration of the chamber: a contraction diaphragm divided by two the frequency level of the fluctuations in the studied range of maximum overpressure. Such fluctuations may probably be the consequence of periodic perturbations of the recirculation zone behind the bluff-body. These periodic perturbations are themselves caused by strong periodic overpressure variations due to stiff contraction downstream responding to gas velocity fluctuations. This feed-back-loop mechanism was considered in this study. NOx emissions produced through the thermal pathway were analyzed for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.29 to 1. The representation of NOx versus equivalence ratio exhibited a parabolic shape with a maximum for an equivalence ratio of 0.4. Moreover, NOx emissions of this metal combustor have shown a similar order of magnitude than current internal combustion engines.",

Recently, there has been growing interest in exploring the potential of metal powders as recyclable, zero-carbon energy carriers as an alternative to the hydrocarbons known to contribute to climate change. The present work introduces, for the first time, a stabilized flat iron flame. The counterflow burner used in this work is comprised of an inverted ceramic nozzle which sits above, and is aligned axially with, a lower nozzle producing a laminar flow of particles suspended in an oxidizing gas. A stabilized methane flame sits inside the top nozzle and the hot combustion products impinge upon the two-phase flow from the bottom nozzle, creating a stagnation plane. Spherical iron powder, with 90% of the particles less than 2.5 \u00b5m in size, is pre-loaded into a piston and dispersed using mixtures of 30% and 40% oxygen balanced in argon. Flame speeds are measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV), while flame temperatures are determined using multicolour pyrometry. It is found that flame speeds range between 30\u00a0cm/s and 45\u00a0cm/s for both oxidizing mixtures. Despite having fuel loadings below stoichiometric concentrations, the observed particle combustion temperatures are close to the adiabatic flame temperature of the stoichiometric mixture, indicating combustion in the diffusion-controlled regime for these small particles. Finally, the independence of the flame speeds with respect to oxygen concentration suggests flame propagation in the discrete regime.",

The multicomponent nature of practical pyrotechnics results in a particularly complex interaction between the components when heated. A thermo-kinetic study was performed to simulate the heating experienced by the pyrotechnics before the combustion zone. The physical processes occurring within these temperature limits provide important insight into the overall combustion rate.

Samples with a wide range of regular cross-sections \u2013 from triangular through octagonal \u2013 as well as irregular ones, have been used to test a large variation of internal angles. A MATLAB-based tool was used to calculate instantaneous spread rate for central and edge flames. The edge flame is shown to significantly enhance the spread rate, as much as five times, in respect to samples with no edges. This amplification is shown to depend primarily on the internal angle at the edge (the smaller the angle, the faster the flame) and fuel thickness, and not on other factors such as aspect ratio or cross-sectional area. Using a phenomenological argument, the edge propagation rate is correlated to the spread rate over an equivalent cylindrical fuel (the limiting shape with infinite edges) with an effective radius obtained from the geometry of the edges and the diffusion length scale of the solid phase. A formula for flame spread over cylindrical fuel from the literature is used to link the new results to existing models. Both thick and thin limits are shown to encompass the wide range of three-dimensional spread rate data within the effective radius (the independent variable), which can be determined from the known parameters. Based on these results, different types of cross-sectional areas can be sorted in the order of their inherent fire safety characteristics.",

The changes of droplet temperature and evaporation rate after a transient spark heating are reflected in the time-resolved PRR image. Results show that droplet evaporation rate increases with temperature, from \u22121.28 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 m2/s at atmospheric 293\u00a0K to a range of (\u22121.5, \u22128) \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 m2/s when heated to (294, 315) K, agreeing well with the Maxwell and Stefan\u2013Fuchs model predictions. Uncertainty analysis suggests that the main source is the indeterminate gradient inside droplet, resulting in an underestimation of droplet temperature and evaporation rate.

To reduce computation time, chemical fuel surrogates comprised of only a few species are used to emulate the combustion of complex pre-vaporized fuels. These surrogates are often unable to match the vaporization behavior and physical properties of the real fuel and fail to capture the effect of preferential vaporization on combustion behavior. Therefore, a computationally efficient, hybrid droplet vaporization-chemical surrogate approach has been developed which emulates both the physical and chemical properties of a multicomponent kerosene fuel. The droplet vaporization/physical portion of the hybrid uses the Coupled Algebraic\u2013Direct Quadrature Method of Moments with delumping to accurately solve for the evolution of every discrete species in a vaporizing fuel droplet with the computational efficiency of a continuous thermodynamic model. The chemical surrogate portion of the hybrid is linked to the vaporization model using a functional group matching method, which creates an instantaneous surrogate composition to match the distribution of chemical functional groups (CH2, (CH2)n, CH3 and Benzyl-type) in the vaporization flux of the full fuel. The result is a hybrid method which can accurately and efficiently predict time-dependent, distillation-resolved combustion property targets of the vaporizing fuel and can be used to investigate the effects of preferential vaporization on combustion behavior.",

The general behavior of droplets size-velocity profiles were also consistent with the literature reports. Nonetheless, complex variations in the distribution of droplets velocity when changing the crossflow turbulence intensity were observed and linked with the presence of instabilities on the liquid jet's surface.

The present study is focusing on the effect of physical fuel properties, mostly viscosity difference, on the breakup process of the liquid jet injected into still air. Two different jet fuels, CAT-A2 and CAT-C3, are considered here as surrogates for a fossil-based fuel and a bio-derived high-viscosity alternative fuel. The simulations are performed using the volume-of-fluid (VoF) interface tracking method coupled to Lagrangian particle method in order to capture the breakup instabilities of jets and the resulting droplets. The investigations take the actual geometry of the injector into account to resolve the unsteady flow phenomena inside the nozzle that impact the turbulence transition and atomization.

The MMC mixing model is compared with the interaction by exchange with the mean (IEM) mixing model. The ignition delay predictions are not sensitive to the mixing model and are predicted well by both the mixing models under all the tested ambient conditions. The IEM model overpredicts the flame lift-off length (FLOL) at high temperature and high oxygen conditions with a mixing constant C \u03d5 = 2 . The MMC model with C \u03d5 = 2 and a target correlation coefficient r t = 0.935 between the mixture fraction and a reference variable used to condition mixing predicts good FLOL under all the conditions except 800\u00a0K. It is demonstrated that the lift-off length is controllable by changing the target correlation coefficient, while C\u03d5 and therefore the mixing fields are held fixed. In comparison to the MMC model, the IEM model predicts a higher variance of temperature conditioned on mixture fraction near the flame base owing to its lacking the property of localness.

The Optical Connectivity Method (OCM) has been proposed in the last years to allow the determination of the breakup length of the connected liquid core, thus giving a measurement quantity of the primary breakup. In this work, an improved optical setup of the OCM is applied to a three-hole test injector nozzle where several measurement techniques are compared currently under well-defined conditions up to 100\u202fMPa injection pressure. In this work, the direct comparison with X-Ray measurements done at the Advanced Photon Source of the Argonne National Laboratory will be described. This allows an evaluation of the OCM technique and a comparison of the different measurement quantities in the first 500\u202f\u00b5m range of the spray. The structure of the spray is measured by X-Ray phase contrast imaging and the fuel mass distribution is measured by X-Ray absorption imaging. A detailed comparison of the two X-Ray techniques and the OCM technique has been possible for the first time. It is found that the measurement data of the spray near field are very congruent with all three methods. Due to this comparison, the measurement of the non-perturbed length, which describes the distance from the nozzle orifice up to the point where the formation of surface disturbances is starting, by the OCM is validated for the first time. Within this non-perturbed length of the spray, the OCM signal is weak before it starts to illuminate from the scattering of the perturbed surface. Thus, the OCM technique can deliver two characteristic length scales, the non-perturbed length and the breakup length, characterizing the primary spray breakup.",

The numerical method was then used to predict drop-wall interactions at various temperatures and velocities. The model was able to predict the different outcomes, such as rebound, spread, splash, breakup, and the Leidenfrost phenomenon, consistent with the physical understanding.",

     "abstract": "Fuel spray impingement on engine wall and piston in the spark-ignition direct-injection (SIDI) setting has been considered a major concern in the aspect of engine emission and combustion efficiency. Excess wall film will result in deterioration of engine friction, incomplete combustion, and substantial cycle-to-cycle variations. These effects are more pronounced during engine cold-start process. Therefore, the formation of wall film on engine wall/piston and the dynamic process of the wall film interacting with impinging spray and spray-induced gas flow are of great significance for reducing wall film mass. However, the dynamic process of wall film was not investigated thoroughly in existing literatures. This work will present a high-speed, simultaneous measurement of a single-hole spray structure, as well as wall film geometry and thickness, via Mie scattering and volumetric laser-induced fluorescence, respectively. Quantitative film thickness measurement was achieved via fluorescence intensity signal calibration with a known, wedge-shape liquid film apparatus. Remarkable wall film droplet entrainment at the leading edge of the liquid film waves was revealed in the measurement, which has not been adequately depicted or analyzed in existing spray impingement studies. A considerable amount of liquid droplets detaches from the liquid film via liquid film fingering, during which process the quantity of liquid mass on the wall is decreased. Quantitative analysis of such phenomenon is performed and we estimated that a liquid mass equivalent to 30\u201340% of the residual liquid film mass is detached from the liquid film via wave entrainment. Furthermore, through the comparative study of the side view of the spray and the liquid film caused by spray impingement, it is shown that non-uniform spray structure is likely the cause of liquid film wavy motions. These observations suggest that wave entrainment should be considered by numerical models and experimental designs to accurately predict spray impingement phenomenon.",

To this end, two zero-dimensional droplet models are considered that are representative of asymptotic conditions of diffusion limit and the distillation limit are considered. The coupling between diffusion, evaporation and combustion is first identified using a scale analysis of 0D homogeneous batch reactor simulations. Subsequently, direct numerical simulations of homogeneously dispersed multicomponent droplets are performed for both droplet models, in decaying isotropic turbulence and at quiescent conditions to examine competing time scale effects arising from evaporation, ignition and turbulence. Results related to intra-droplet transport and effects of turbulence on autoignition and overall combustion are studied using an aviation fuel surrogate. Depending on the characteristic scale, it is shown that turbulence can couple through modulation of evaporation time or defer the ignition phase as a result of droplet cooling or gas-phase homogenization. Both preferential evaporation and turbulence are found to modify the ignition delay time, up to a factor of two. More importantly, identical droplet ignition behavior in homogeneous gas phase can imply fundamentally different combustion modes in heterogeneous environments.",

The number of carbon atoms in the synthesized N-alkylated propargyl-imidazolium dicyanamide with alkyl substituents varied from 1 to 7. The ILs under study can be grouped in two categories depending on the initial location of the flame zone. When R has 1 to 3 carbon atoms, ignition is visualized as a glow inside a bubble (formed after droplet fall) and above the liquid surface. When the number n of carbon atoms in R is 4 to 6, no glow is recorded inside the bubble. In the case of a heptyl substituent, ignition does not occur since no flame is observed during approximately one minute. It is shown that the value of ignition delay can be interpreted as an Arrhenius-type function where the exponent depends linearly on n. An analysis of high-speed video records shows that the evaporation starting time of WFNA measured from the first IL\u2013WFNA contact is also an Arrhenius-type function of n. Furthermore, it is found that the time for a bubble to reach its maximum diameter is independent of n. A possible mechanism of reaction between ILs of this class and WFNA is suggested and discussed.",

The volume of the combustion chamber provided with large optical windows simplified the implementation of various optical diagnostics. The advantage of this kind of set-up in comparison to pre-burn or flue chambers is that the initial gas mixture can be well controlled in terms of species and mole fraction. The purpose of this work was to investigate the impact of nitric oxide (NO) on ignition delay (ID) for two fuels with different cetane numbers: n-heptane, and n-dodecane. In the thermodynamic conditions chosen (60\u202fbar and over 800\u2013900\u202fK), NO had a strong effect on ID, with increases in NO tending to reduce the ignition delay. Results showed that ID and Lift-Off Length (LOL) presented the same trend as a function of temperature and NO concentration. Experimentally, at 900\u202fK the ignition of n-dodecane was promoted by NO up to 100\u202fppm, whilst higher NO levels did not further promote ignition and a stabilization of the value has been noticed. For n-heptane, stronger promoting effects were observed in the same temperature conditions: the ignition delays were monotonically reduced with up to 200\u202fppm NO addition. At a lower temperature (800\u202fK) the inhibiting effect was observed for n-dodecane for [NO] greater than 40\u202fppm, whereas only a promoting effect was observed for n-heptane. The experimental results of LOL showed that NO shortened LOL in almost all cases, and this varied with both the NO concentration and the mixture temperature. Thus, fuels with shorter ignition delays produce shorter lift-off lengths.",

Simulations demonstrate that, compared to the conventional single-regime flamelets, the present partially premixed flamelet formulation shows its ability in capturing the subgrid regime transitions, yielding a well prediction of peak gas temperature and the downstream flame spreading. A propagating premixed flame front is found coupled with a trailing diffusion burning through the spray evaporation, and the spray effect on regime discrimination is manifested with transport budget analysis. A two-phase regime indicator is then proposed, by which the evaporation-dictated regime is properly described. Its intended use will rely on both gas and spray flamelet structures.",

To this end, three different combustion models are examined, namely a finite-rate chemistry model, a flamelet/progress variable model, and a flame prolongation of intrinsic low dimensional manifold model. In the two flamelet approaches, effects of spray evaporation are considered in the limit of small Stokes number. By examining radial profiles and employing a doubly-conditioned analysis on gaseous mixture fraction and liquid-to-gas mass ratio, it is shown that both flamelet models show differences in the evaporation and subsequent gas phase combustion and temperature field.

     "abstract": "The binary collisions of a burning droplet and a non-burning droplet of xylene are experimentally investigated. The experimental parameters span an extensive range of Weber number and impact parameter, covering the collision outcome regimes of coalescence, reflexive separation, and stretching separation. A high-speed camera captures the temporal details of the collision process, involving flame spread, visible radiation, and flame distributions around droplets. For reflexive separation and stretching separation, the flame from the droplet spreads to the ligament, surrounding it during the interaction process, and then spreads around separated droplets and satellite droplets. Highly-interactive flames are formed in-between the droplets, with very sooty flames generated for most collisions. For the coalescence case, a swirling flame forms around the rotating coalesced droplet. For similar Weber numbers, visible flame radiation is compared for different collision regimes. The visible flame radiation changes more significantly for the reflexive and stretching separation cases than it does for the coalescence case. The change of the averaged visible flame radiation for reflexive separation and stretching separation is more than two times higher than that for coalescence. The map of three different collision regimes is plotted in the Weber number versus impact parameter domain and compared with available theoretical model predictions. Although the different outcomes of collision with the presence of flame can be well predicted by the model, using fluid properties determined by the averaged properties of the two droplets, the dynamics of the detailed processes involved in the collisions are very interesting and have strong implications on overall combustion behavior that go well beyond the mapped regimes.",

We report the presence of unique quasi-steady, three-stage burning behavior of large sphero-symmetric n-alkane droplets at these elevated pressures and helium substituted ambient fractions. Upon initiation of reaction, hot-flame diffusive burning of large droplets is initiated that radiatively extinguishes to establish cool flame burning conditions in nitrogen/oxygen \u201cair\u201d at atmospheric and elevated pressures. However, at elevated pressure and moderate helium substitution for nitrogen (XHe\u202f>\u202f20%), the initiated cool flame burning proceeds through two distinct, quasi-steady-state, cool flame burning conditions. The classical \u201cHot flame\u201d (\u223c1500\u202fK) radiatively extinguishes into a \u201cWarm flame\u201d burning mode at a moderate maximum reaction zone temperature (\u223c 970\u202fK), followed by a transition to a lower temperature (\u223c765\u202fK), quasi-steady \u201cCool flame\u201d burning condition. The reaction zone (\u201cflame\u201d) temperatures are associated with distinctly different yields in intermediate reaction products within the reaction zones and surrounding near-field, and the flame-standoff ratios characterizing each burning mode progressively decrease. The presence of all three stages first appears with helium substitution near 20%, and the duration of each stage is observed to be strongly dependent on helium substitutions level between 20\u201360%. For helium substitution greater than 60%, the hot flame extinction is followed by only the lower temperature cool flame burning mode. In addition to the strong coupling between the diffusive loss of both energy and species and the slowly evolving degenerate branching in the low and negative temperature coefficient (NTC) kinetic regimes, the competition between the low-temperature chain branching and intermediate-temperature chain termination reactions control the \u201cWarm\u201d and \u201cCool\u201d flame quasi-steady conditions and transitioning dynamics. Experiments onboard the International Space Station with n-dodecane droplets confirm the existence of these combustion characteristics and predictions agree favorably with these observations.",

     "abstract": "In the present work, nonpremixed temporally evolving planar spray jet flames are simulated using both direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the composition transported probability density function (TPDF) method. The objective is to assess the performance of various mixing and evaporation source term distribution models which are required to close the PDF transport equation in spray flames. Quantities which would normally be provided to the TPDF solver by spray models and turbulence models are provided from the DNS: the mean flow velocity, turbulent diffusivity, mixing frequency, and cell-mean evaporation source term. Two cases with different Damk\u00f6hler numbers (Da) are considered. The low Da case (Da-) features extinction followed by reignition while extinction in the high Da case (Da+) is insignificant. The TPDF modelling considers two mixing models: interaction by exchange with the mean (IEM) and Euclidean minimum spanning trees (EMST). Three models for distribution of the evaporation source terms are considered: EQUAL which distributes them in proportion to notional particles\u2019 mass weight, NEW which creates new particles of pure fuel, and SAT which distributes the sources preferentially to notional particles close to saturation. It is found that the IEM model overpredicts the extinction when used with any evaporation model for both Da- and Da+ cases. The EMST model captures well the trend for extinction and reignition for the Da- case when it is coupled with the EQUAL evaporation model, but it overpredicts the extinction when coupled with the NEW or SAT evaporation model. For the Da+ case, all evaporation models reasonably capture the flame dynamics when coupled with EMST. The flame temperature in the mixture fraction space was examined to further assess the model performance. In general the EMST model results in narrow PDFs with little conditional fluctuation, while the IEM model produces bimodal PDFs with burning and partial extinction branches.",

Experimentally, laboratory-scale burners are increasingly used to investigate these processes and support model development. One ultimate objective of these studies would be to deliver suitable benchmark data. In the present paper, the focus is similar but relying exclusively on direct numerical simulations. Conditions close that found in lab-scale burners are considered in the simulations, so that direct comparisons will ultimately become possible. The current analysis concentrates on the temporal evolution of temperature and concentrations of OH, CH2O, and CH4. The profiles of these variables show very complex features, therefore separate zones corresponding to characteristic physicochemical regimes have been tracked in time and space. It is found that, based on the temperature profile, four different zones coexist in the domain, associated to different degrees of competition between evaporation and reaction. It is observed that high concentrations of CH2O and CH4 can be used to delineate between three characteristic locations: 1) the evaporation zone; 2) close to the jet tip, at high temperatures; and 3) regions where evaporated droplets are entrained by mixing. This study demonstrates that direct numerical simulation of small spray burners can be used to deliver important information and to contribute useful benchmark data.",

     "abstract": "This paper reports simulation results of oscillatory cool flame burning of an isolated, submillimeter sized n-heptane (n-C7H16) droplet in a selectively ozone (O3) seeded nitrogen-oxygen (N2-O2) environments at atmospheric pressure. An evolutionary one-dimensional droplet combustion code encompassing relevant physics and detailed chemistry was employed to explore the roles of low-temperature chemistry, O3 seeding, and dynamic flame structure on burning behaviors. For XO2=\u202f21% and a range of selective ozone seeding, near-quasi-steady cool flame burning is achieved directly (without requiring hot flame initiation and radiative extinction). Under low oxygen index conditions, but with significant O3 seeding (XO3 = 5%), a nearly quasi-steady cool flame is initially established that then transitions to a dynamically oscillating cool flame burning mode which continues until the droplet is completely consumed. It is found that the oscillation occurs as result of a initial depletion of fuel vapor-oxidizer layer evolving near the droplet surface and its dynamic re-establishment through liquid vaporization and vapor/oxidizer transport. A kinetic analysis indicates that the dynamic competition between the reaction classes- (a) degenerate chain branching and (b) chain termination/propagation - along with continuous fuel and oxygen leakage through the flame location contributes to an oscillatory burning phenomena of ever-increasing amplitude. Analysis based on single full-cycle of oscillatory burning shows that the reaction progression matrices (evolution of heat and species) for QOOH\u2794chain propagation/termination reactions (here, Q\u202f=\u202fC7H14-) directly scales with the gas phase temperature field. On the contrary, the QOOH\u2794degenerate branching reactions undergoes three distinct stages within the same oscillatory cycle. The coupled flame dynamics and kinetics suggest that in the oscillatory burning mode, kinetic processes dynamically cross through conditions characterizing the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) turnover temperature, separating low temperature and NTC kinetic regimes. In addition, a parametric study is conducted to determine the role of O3 seeding level on the observed oscillation phenomena.",

Diesel droplet flame was used to contaminate the droplet to be investigated prior to ignition. Distinct differences in lifetime and stability of the burning of the neat and contaminated droplet samples were observed in their heating, boiling and disruptive phases. For a soot-contaminated droplet surface, the evaporation rate became weaker as a result of slower mass transfer thus contracted the flame formation. Contrary to the burning rate enhancement of droplet with stable and uniform suspension of particles observed by other researchers, the slightest contamination of soot particles in a fuel droplet surface can significantly reduce the burning rate. Denser agglomeration of soot can form a shell on the droplet surface which blocks the flow of gas escaping through the surface thus distort the droplet even further. At late combustion stage, bubbles are observed to rapture on the surface of the soot-contaminated droplet. Strong ejections of volatile liquid and vapour that would explode shortly after parting from the droplet are observed. It seems that the explosion and burning of ejected mixture have little interactions with the enveloped flame surrounding the primary droplet. Enhanced visualisation of droplet liquid-phase has clearly indicated the cause of declining trend in the burning rate and flame stand-off ratio of soot-contaminated diesel droplet. These insights are of significance for understanding the effect of fuel droplet contamination by combustion generated soot particles.",

The droplet-cloud element represents a local droplet pattern appearing in randomly distributed droplet clouds near the group-combustion-excitation limit and consists of small-droplet-spacing droplets and large-droplet-spacing droplets. As droplet-cloud elements, we used four n-decane droplets, Droplets C, B, A and L, placed at fiber intersections of two-dimensional SiC-fiber lattice with a 4-mm fiber interval in a combustion chamber. The flame spreads over the droplet-cloud element in order of Droplets C, B, A and L. The position of Droplet L relative to Droplet A was varied to investigate the flame-spread-limit distribution around burning Droplet A. The position of Droplet B relative to Droplet A was varied to investigate the effect of two-droplet interaction between Droplets B and A on the flame spread to Droplet L. The position of Droplet C relative to Droplet B was also varied to investigate the effect of three-droplet interaction among Droplets C, B and A. The results shows that in the case with the strong interaction by two or three interactive droplets, the high-temperature region is enlarged by the droplet interaction, centers near the center of mass of the interactive droplets and plays an important role in the flame-spread-limit distribution. Since the burning lifetime of Droplet A is finite, the flame-spread time from burning Droplet A to Droplet L is limited by burning lifetime of Droplet A and is less than 80% of the burning lifetime of Droplet A, which increases with the interactive effect. The flame-spread-limit distance from the center of mass of the interactive droplets increases with the burning lifetime.",

The interaction between these compression waves and the flame front leads to the change in the total burning rate of the foam.

It is observed that an increase in the air mass flow rate from 25\u00a0g/s to 225\u00a0g/s causes an increase in the propagation velocity of the stable CRDW in the RDC. For an oxygen volume fraction up to 35%, the difference between the propagation velocity of detonation and the theoretical Chapman\u2013Jouguet value is less than 5%. Under the chemical stoichiometric ratio condition for air, the CRDW is stabilized when the air mass flow rate reaches 185\u00a0g/s. However, stabilized CRDW is observed even when the air flow rate is only 45\u00a0g/s under the presence of 30% or 35% oxygen. Increase in the oxygen volume fraction leads to an extension of the rich/lean limit for generating a stable CRDW.

The present paper provides the evaluation of the specific impulse (Isp), pressure gain and the thrust coefficient for different micro-nozzle stagnation pressures and for two configurations of conic aerospike nozzle, open and choked aerospike. The simulations show that regardless of the nozzle, increase the micro-nozzles stagnation pressure increases the mass flow rate, the pre-detonation gases pressure and consequently the post-detonation pressure. This gain of pressure in the combustion chamber leads to a higher pressure thrust through the nozzle, improving the Isp. It was also found that the choked nozzle increases the chamber time-averaged static pressure by 50\u201360% compared with the open nozzle, inducing higher performance for the same reason explained before.",

It was observed that a strongly coupled detonation is required for igniting a fueled cavity and the ignition capability rapidly decays for a weak or slightly decoupled detonation. The pulse detonation igniter pressure and wave speed were measured at subatmospheric pressure to characterize the pressure and fill characteristics dependence on backpressure. Temperatures measurements using 100\u00a0kHz H2O absorption measurements showed an increase in peak temperature for critically filled conditions but a decrease in bulk fluid temperature with decreasing fill time. Simultaneous schlieren and chemiluminescence measurements demonstrate that a fully coupled detonation entrains greater quantities of high-temperature and reacting fluid in the vortex formed on the edges of the detonation plume, enhancing the mixing and spreading of products into the cavity. This shedding of high-temperature intermediate species is the primary mechanism governing successful ignition in the scramjet cavity.",

     "abstract": "We describe the critical condition necessary for the inner cylinder radius of a rotating detonation engine (RDE) used for in-space rocket propulsion to sustain adequate thruster performance. Using gaseous C2H4 and O2 as the propellant, we measured thrust and impulse of the RDE experimentally, varying in the inner cylinder radius ri from 31\u00a0mm (typical annular configuration) to 0 (no-inner-cylinder configuration), while keeping the outer cylinder radius (ro\u00a0=\u00a039\u00a0mm) and propellant injector position (rinj\u00a0=\u00a035\u00a0mm) constant. In the experiments, we also performed high-speed imaging of self-luminescence in the combustion chamber and engine plume. In the case of relatively large inner cylinder radii (ri\u00a0=\u00a023 and 31\u00a0mm), rotating detonation waves in the combustion chamber attached to the inner cylinder surface, whereas for relatively small inner cylinder radii (ri\u00a0=\u00a00, 9, and 15\u00a0mm), rotating detonation waves were observed to detach from the inner cylinder surface. In these small inner radii cases, strong chemical luminescence was observed in the plume, probably due to the existence of soot. On the other hand, for cases where ri\u00a0=\u00a015, 23, and 31\u00a0mm, the specific impulses were greater than 80% of the ideal value at correct expansion. Meanwhile, for cases ri\u00a0=\u00a00 and 9\u00a0mm, the specific impulses were below 80% of the ideal expansion value. This was considered to be due to the imperfect detonation combustion (deflagration combustion) observed in small inner cylinder radius cases. Our results suggest that in our experimental conditions, ri\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0mm was close to the critical condition for sustaining rotating detonation in a suitable state for efficient thrust generation. This condition in the inner cylinder radius corresponds to a condition in the reduced unburned layer height of 4.5\u20136.5.",

In this setup, ethylene and oxygen were injected separately into each recessed injector tube, while a total of 15 injectors were used to establish a partially premixed reactant jet array. The results revealed various details of transient flowfield, including a complex detonation wave front leading a curved oblique shock wave, the unsteady production of transverse waves at the edge of the reactant jets, and the onset of suppressed reactant jets re-entering the combustor following a detonation wave passage. The visualization images showed a complex, multidimensional, and highly irregular detonation wave front. It appeared non-uniform mixing of reactant jets lead to dynamic transverse wave structure. The refreshed reactant jets evolving in the wake of the detonation wave were severely distorted, indicating the effect of dynamic flowfield and rapid pressure change. The results suggest that the mixing between the fuel and oxidizer, as well as the mixing between the fresh reactants and the background products, should affect the stability of the RDE combustor processes.",

     "abstract": "An ignition time model is developed to model super knock in a compression engine. The model assumes that thermoacoustic interaction is the primary mechanism for the onset of super knock. By ignoring diffusive effects, a simple transport equation for the time to ignition of a fluid particle is derived. The significantly reduced cost of the chemistry model allows for complex hydrocarbon fuels to be simulated. Additionally, a zonal model for the secondary ignition of a charge due to the action of an expanding flame is developed. The flame compresses the unburned gas, causing the temperature and pressure to rise, which yields a pre-ignition in the unburned gas before the charge is engulfed by the flame. It is shown that the ignition time model compares well to the detailed chemical model with less than 1% difference in the prediction of ignition delay. Using this ignition time model, a multi-dimensional simulation of super knock in a rapid compression machine corresponding to the configuration of Wang et\u00a0al. [1] is performed. It is found that interaction of the shock with the flame and the side wall of the cylinder significantly enhances the strength of the shock, and the in-cylinder pressure exceeds 300\u00a0bar. From the pressure rise predicted by the simulation, it is concluded that simulated ignition is a super knock event. Since the ignition time model excludes diffusive effects on the chemistry, it is proposed that acoustic resonance of the cylinder is the primary driver in the development of super knock for the configuration under examination and that inhomogeneous ignition due to transient flame compression could be a key mechanism for super knock.",

The simulations used a high-order compressible numerical method for fluid dynamics with both detailed and simplified chemical-diffusive models. Three material interfaces were considered: no interface, a perturbed planar flame, and a perturbed helium interface. The case with no interface did not evolve into a detonation. The case with the flame produced a series of additional shock-flame and shock-shock interactions. The shock-shock interactions produced a series of contact surfaces and sliplines with increasing temperature. Hot spots eventually formed along these sliplines and a detonation was initiated shortly thereafter through a reactivity gradient mechanism. The overall process of detonation initiation was similar for both detailed and simplified chemical-diffusive models. Only the fine details, such as the precise time and location of the hot spots, were different. This indicates that simplified chemical-diffusive models are adequate to describe the initiation of detonations in the present configuration. The processes that ignited the detonation were also similar in the case where the flame was replaced with a helium interface. Helium has a similar acoustic impedance to the products and produced similar wave refraction patterns. Thus, the primary effect of the flame is to facilitate the shock-shock interactions that produce hot spots and initiate the detonation. The chemical energy released by the flame has a secondary influence.",

The specific problem addressed here is for ignition in a two-dimensional, obstructed channel where there is a spatial gradient of equivalence ratios perpendicular to the propagation direction of the reaction wave. The solution method uses a calibrated, optimized chemical-diffusive model that reproduces correct flame and detonation properties for methane\u2013air mixtures over a range of equivalence ratios. Comparisons were made to a stoichiometric, homogeneous mixture in order to focus on the worst-case scenario for safety concerns. The results showed that the flame speed is smaller and the average total heat release are lower, but the maximum flame surface area is larger in the inhomogeneous mixture. This is because there is more unburned material between obstacles but less energy released from this increased flame surface area in the fuel-lean region, leading to the reduction of the total heat release. The transition to detonation is delayed in the inhomogeneous mixture, because the hot spot forms in the fuel-lean region and the strength of the Mach stem that hits the obstacle is weaker. The detonation front tends to decouple into a shock and a flame earlier in the inhomogeneous mixture, due to the incomplete mixing throughout the entire domain during the detonation propagation process.",

Neutron radiography was used to map in situ loss of elemental hydrogen from beech tree wood samples during pyrolysis. The samples consisted of three wood cylinders (finished dowel or cut branch) of approximately 1\u00a0cm in length. The samples were pyrolyzed under vacuum in a furnace vessel that was placed inside a cold neutron imaging beamline using a temperature ramp of 5\u00a0\u00b0C/min from ambient up to 400\u00a0\u00b0C. Neutron radiographs with exposures of 30\u00a0s were sequentially recorded with a charge-coupled device over the course of the experiment. Relative absorbance/scattering of the neutron beam by each sample was based on intensity (or brightness) values as a function of pixel position. The much larger neutron cross section for hydrogen compared to carbon and oxygen enables almost direct conversion of neutron attenuation into sample hydrogen content for each time step during the pyrolysis experiment. Target and vessel temperatures were recorded concurrently with collection of the radiographs so that changes could be directly correlated to different states of pyrolysis. The most visible change appeared at the initial phase of the 400\u00a0\u00b0C plateau as evidenced by strong hydrogen loss and primarily diametric shrinking of the samples. The loss of elemental hydrogen between initial and final states of pyrolysis was estimated to be about 70%.",

Spatial resolution is achieved by temporally-resolved detection of the backward lasing using a streak camera. The method is demonstrated in CH4/O2 flames; both in a setup consisting of two flames, with variable spacing between the flames, and in a single flame. Results from the two-flame experiment show that the backward lasing technique is able to determine changes in the separation between the flames as this distance was altered. By maximizing the temporal resolution of the streak camera, obtaining a highest spatial resolution of 1.65\u00a0mm, it is possible to resolve the hydrogen signal present in the two reaction zones in the single flame, where the separation between the reaction zones is \u202f\u223c2\u00a0mm. The lasing signal is strong enough to allow single-shot measurements. Results obtained by backward lasing are compared with 2-photon planar laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) images recorded with detection perpendicular to the laser beam path and the results from the two methods qualitatively agree. Although further studies are needed in order to extract quantitative hydrogen concentrations, the present results indicate great potential for spatially resolved single-ended measurements, which would constitute a very valuable asset for combustion diagnostics in intractable geometries with limited optical access. It appears feasible to extend the technique to detection of any species for which resonant two-photon-excited lasing effect has been observed, such as O, N, C, CO and NH3.",

The sensor consisted of a pulsed quantum cascade laser (QCL) coupled to a low-finesse cavity in the RCM using an off-axis alignment. The QCL was tuned near 4.89\u202f\u00b5m to probe the P(23) ro-vibrational line of CO. The pulsed mode operation resulted in rapid frequency down-chirp (6.52\u00a0cm\u22121/\u00b5s) within the pulse as well as a high time resolution (10\u00a0\u00b5s). The combination of rapid frequency down-chirp and off-axis cavity alignment enabled a near complete suppression of the cavity coupling noise. A CEAS gain factor of 133 was demonstrated in experiments, resulting in a much lower noise-equivalent detection limit than a single-pass arrangement. The sensor thus presents many opportunities for measuring CO formation at low temperatures and for studying kinetics using dilute reactive environments; one such application is demonstrated in this work using dilute n-heptane/air mixtures in the RCM. The formation of CO during first-stage ignition of n-heptane was measured over 802\u2013899\u202fK at a nominal pressure of 10\u202fbar. These conditions correspond to the NTC region of n-heptane and such results provide useful metrics to test and compare the predictions of low-temperature heat release by different kinetic models.",

As opposed to gaseous fuels, additional phase-change steps present in liquid sprays not only complicate the overall combustion process, but also make in-situ, laser-based combustion diagnostics challenging. In particular, the formation of carbon monoxide (CO) due to incomplete fuel-air mixing and partial oxidation becomes a major challenge. In this study, we apply femtosecond, two-photon laser-induced fluorescence (fs-TPLIF) to measure CO concentration in piloted liquid-spray flames, taking into account possible signal interferences in the 230.1-nm, B1\u03a3+\u2190X1\u03a3+ excitation scheme. A modified, flat-flame McKenna burner fitted with a direct-injection high-efficiency nebulizer (DIHEN) was used to produce piloted liquid-methanol spray flames. Although single-laser-shot OH-PLIF images show the presence of strong turbulent interactions in the core region, shot-averaged OH-PLIF images indicate that near the nozzle-exit region, the primary reaction takes place in an annular region around the droplet cloud, in general. A detailed spectroscopic study reveals that the signal interference at 460\u202fnm originating from the second-order scattering of the excitation laser, which becomes approximately an order of magnitude stronger than CO fluorescence spectral lines near the nozzle exit region. The specific spectral filtering scheme introduced in our recent work is proved to be capable of suppressing interferences primarily originating from C2 Swan-band emissions. Two-dimensional CO maps along with OH-PLIF flame structure data provide key insights into the CO formation in piloted liquid-spray flames, while providing critical validation datasets for advanced computational models.",

The NH species was probed after exciting the transition R1(6) in the A3\u03a0-X3\u03a3\u2212 (0-0) system at 333.9\u202fnm. The mole fraction profiles of NH were successfully obtained in premixed low-pressure flames of CH4/O2/N2 and C2H2/O2/N2 at two equivalence ratios of 1.00 and 1.25.

Modification of the rate constant values of the reactions C2H2+\u202fO and HCCO\u202f+\u202fO2, which are key reactions for both the acetylene laminar flame speed and the HCCO predictions, has enabled the model to satisfactorily predict the experimental NH and NO profiles also in the C2H2 flames.",

Results showed that auto-ignition randomly occurred with high probability in a well defined fairly axisymmetric radial region with strong fluctuations in the main direction of the flow.

In this work, we described the spectroscopic fundamentals for measuring heterodyne phase signals in flames. As a proof of principle, we used a mid-infrared interband cascade laser (ICL) near 4183\u202fnm to exploit the strong CO2 transitions in the R-branch of the v3 fundamental band. The HPSDS signals of four CO2 lines, R(76), R(78), R(80) and R(82), were measured in CH4/air flames to obtain CO2 concentrations at different equivalence ratios (\u03a6\u202f=\u202f0.8\u20131.2), yielding a good agreement with the simultaneous laser absorption measurements using the same ICL.

     "abstract": "For the first time, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, nonintrusive quantitative measurement of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) released during the devolatilization phase of straw pellets gasification is demonstrated with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mid-infrared degenerate four-wave mixing (IR-DFWM) measurements of HCN were performed by probing the interference-free P(20) line in the v1 vibrational band at around 3\u202f\u00b5m and the IR-DFWM signal was detected with an upconversion-based detector, providing discrimination of thermal noise and increased sensitivity. A novel single-pellet setup consisting of a multi-jet burner was used to provide hot flue gas environments with an even and well-defined temperature distribution, for single straw pellet gasification at atmospheric pressure. The environments had temperatures of 1380\u202fK, 1540\u202fK and 1630\u202fK with a constant oxygen concentration of 0.5\u202fvol%. In order to quantify the amount of HCN released during the devolatilization of straw pellets, calibration measurements were performed in well-defined HCN gas flows. Selected hot water lines were probed with IR-DFWM in the interrogated volume to obtain the instantaneous temperature, which were used to correct the temperature effect. HCN concentrations up to 1500\u202fppm were detected during the devolatilization stage, and the results indicate a strong temperature dependence of the HCN release.",

     "abstract": "Cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) has generated much interest in shocktube kinetics studies because of its recent success in achieving improved sensitivity and high time resolution with robust optical alignment. While recent progress demonstrated experimental schemes including off-axis scanned-wavelength approach and on-axis ps-pulsed laser approach, that both successfully suppressed the laser-cavity coupling noise, this paper develops a theoretical model to predict the CEAS sensor performance that can be used as a design tool applicable to more generalized cases. The method models the optical field in the cavity based on the decentered Gaussian beam model, from which the cavity transmission spectrum and the laser-cavity coupling noise can be numerically calculated. The simulation results predict sensor performance for different cavity configurations and laser characteristics, including various degrees of laser-cavity mode-matching, laser linewidths, scanning rates, and cavity filling conditions. Simulation with example wavelengths in the ultraviolet, near-infrared, and mid-infrared showed increasing mode-matched beam waist size for increasing wavelengths. An off-axis alignment scheme was found to be capable of suppressing the coupling noise by two orders-of-magnitude at a moderate laser linewidth of 1\u202fGHz. Coupling noise level on the order of 1e-5 for scanned-wavelength off-axis alignment case with a narrowband mid-infrared laser was obtained by model calculation and agreed with experimental results within acceptable uncertainty range. The developed method can serve to guide future design and optimization of CEAS system in shocktube studies.",

The resulting spatial mixture inhomogeneities may impact ignition and combustion. The technique presented here images the effect of preferential evaporation of a multi-component gasoline surrogate fuel in an optically-accessible direct-injection engine motored on nitrogen. It is based on laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of two aromatic tracers with different volatilities, 1,4-difluorobenzene (representing light to medium components) and 1-methylnaphthalene (heavy component) added to a base-fuel of n-pentane, iso-octane, and n-undecane. LIF from the two tracers is spectrally separated and detected on two cameras, with channel crosstalk corrected in post-processing. Consistent with previous measurements in a high-pressure vessel, the light components are preferentially found downstream, towards the front of the evaporated fuel jet. Throughout large regions of the field of view, about 20% surplus of 1-methylnaphthalene is found, and throughout smaller ones about 40% of 1,4-difluorobenzene. To better assess the impact of the (unknown) local temperature on the measurement accuracy, two-color thermometry based on LIF of anisole (methoxybenzene) is performed in separate experiments. In the relevant range of crank-angles the local temperature is found to be 25\u00a0K lower in regions of high fuel concentration than in the rest of the charge, implying a systematic temperature-induced error in the fuel-tracer ratio of 0.11.",

By collecting the atomic spectra of vanadium near 439\u202fnm from nano-sized plasmas within the \u223c30\u202fns lifetime, particle information can be revealed without interference from elastic scattering or Bremsstrahlung emissions. As the laser intensity increases, the signal intensity first increases and then saturates when the laser intensity reaches 0.5\u00a0GW/cm2. In the saturation regime, a proportional correlation is established between the signal intensity and the particle volume fraction. Based on the parametric study in the laminar condition, we image the instantaneous distribution of particle volume fraction in the turbulent condition using single-shot PS-LIBS measurements. The snapshots show that vanadic oxide nanoparticles concentrate near the diffusion flame surface, which may be caused by the rapid formation of particles on the oxidizer/precursor side and quick dilution across the reaction layer. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis further indicates that the fluctuations of the particle volume fraction originate from the unsteady flame surface at the upstream positions and large-scale mixing at the downstream positions. The single-shot PS-LIBS measurement shows promising potential for resolving complex processes of particle formation in turbulent flame synthesis.",

The burner system features air-blast atomization of liquid injected from a needle that can be translated within a co-flowing air stream. The pilot-stabilized spray flames can range between the two extremes of dense and dilute by physically translating the needle tip relative to the burner's exit plane. The CPP-fs-CARS set-up has achieved integration times of 3 picoseconds (ps) as well as spatial resolution of approximately 800\u00a0\u00b5m along beam propagation and 60\u00a0\u00b5m in the transverse dimension. Brief details of the technique, calibration, correction of interferences, and spectral fitting processes are presented along with estimates of the associated error. The measurements are compared against well-established, line Raman\u2013Rayleigh data for temperature collected in a turbulent CH4/air jet diffusion flame, which is largely non-sooting. At peak gaseous flame temperatures of up to 2512\u00a0K, the relative accuracy and precision were 2.8% and \u00b13.4%, respectively. Measurements in turbulent spray flames are shown after applying the relevant corrections based on non-resonant background (NRB) behavior and camera saturation effects on the shape of the CARS signal spectrum.

The ratio of the emission bands from each ion are measured and calibrated versus temperature to utilize the high sensitivity of thermographic phosphor absolute signal levels. The potential of the technique is illustrated using trivalent cerium (Ce3+) and praseodymium (Pr3+) co-doped into yttrium aluminum garnet (Ce,Pr:YAG). The measured fractional sensitivity of this phosphor from 300\u2013450\u202fK was 0.004\u20130.006\u00a0K\u22121, a factor of 1.5\u20132 better than previously observed for Eu:BAM. Additionally, the single-shot precision (1\u03c3) was between 9 and 25\u202fK over the range of temperatures measured, illustrating the utility of this co-doping strategy. The level of temperature sensitivity and single-shot precision observed here should be achievable over different temperature ranges by doping Ce3+ and Pr3+ into different hosts. This new strategy should provide a pathway to ultimately extend the high-temperature single-shot measurement limit for APT to temperatures greater than 1000\u202fK and push forward the state-of-the-art for planar temperature diagnostics in combustion applications.",

In many instances, however, an unambiguous interpretation of the experimental and modeling results is hampered by the uncertainties about the probe-induced, perturbed temperature profile. To overcome this limitation, two-dimensional perturbations of the temperature field caused by sampling probes with different geometries have been investigated using synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. In these experiments, which were performed at the 7-BM beamline of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at the Argonne National Laboratory, a continuous beam of hard X-rays at 15\u202fkeV was used to excite krypton atoms that were added in a concentration of 5\u202fvol.-% to the unburnt gas mixture and the resulting krypton fluorescence at 12.65\u202fkeV was subsequently collected. The highly spatially resolved signal was converted into the local flame temperature to obtain temperature fields at various burner-probe separations as functions of the distance to the burner surface and the radial distance from the centerline. Multiple measurements were performed with different probe geometries and because of the observed impact on the temperature profiles the results clearly revealed the need to specify the sampling probe design to enable quantitative and meaningful comparisons of modeling results with flame-sampled mole fraction data.",

The acoustic emissions are sensitive to temperature, and a negative correlation can be established. The effect of composition on acoustic emissions was found to be second order compared to that of temperature. Based on these findings, we introduce acoustic-based laser-induced breakdown thermometry (LIBT). A statistical analysis was performed to mitigate the bias introduced by anomalous extreme values. The spatial and temporal resolution of LIBT were also analyzed to demonstrate its potential to perform simultaneous composition and temperature measurements when used along with laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).

The technique has been demonstrated in both steady and turbulent sooting flames, showing good agreements with previous optical measurements. The SC-nTLAF involves imaging simultaneously laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of atomic indium in both the target flame and a non-sooting calibration flame for which the temperature distribution is known. The LIF intensities from the reference flame enable correction for fluctuations, not only in the laser power, but also in the laser mode. The resulting precision was found to be \u00b167\u202fK and \u00b175\u202fK (based on one standard deviation) in the rich and oxidizing regions of a steady sooting flame for which the measured temperature was 1610\u202fK and 1854\u202fK, respectively, with a spatial resolution of 550\u202f\u00d7\u202f550\u00a0\u00b5m2.

The planar imaging also provides more details of the temperature distribution, particularly in the flame brush region, which offers potential for measurement of more parameters, such as gradients and spatial corrections.

Optimizing the sensor's optical arrangement using numerical ray tracing to minimize interference from optical emission, beam steering, and scattered laser light from window surfaces was essential to sensor performance. Scanned-wavelength-modulation spectroscopy with second-harmonic detection and first-harmonic normalization was implemented to allow for frequency-domain multiplexing of the two lasers and to suppress non-absorbing interference sources such as beam-steering and emission.

Experimentally derived spectroscopic parameters enabled water and temperature sensing with respective uncertainties of 7.3% and 5.3% relative to the measured values. Time-resolved and time-averaged sensor measurements of gas temperature and water vapor mole fraction allow quantitative evaluation of the combustion progress at the measurement location and thus provide a design tool for RDE optimization.

The large field-of-view (>170\u00a0cm2) CH2O-PLIF is enabled by use of a burst-mode laser delivering 10-kHz pulse trains of 355-nm at 350\u00a0mJ/pulse, resulting in a CH2O signal-to-noise of 47:1 during PIV seed flow. Two cases illustrative of the CH2O dynamics are presented. A statistically stationary turbulent combustion case highlights the development of the CH2O layers in space and time. Notably, presumed CH2O-vortex dynamic interactions are observed where the CH2O accumulates broadly near the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz vortex core and remains thin near the vortex braid, contributing to a distribution of CH2O preheat zone thickness from 1 to 10 times of the calculated laminar value. The second case highlights the CH2O dynamics during a self-excited combustion instability. Two short-duration increases in CH2O are produced during the elevated velocity portion of\u00a0the acoustic cycle. The first CH2O increase is caused by the reactant mass flux impulse as the velocity starts to increase. The second CH2O increase is the result of the upper and lower shear layers merging downstream and entraining fresh reactants that burn in intense, distributed regions inside the wake. Estimating the time delay between the CH2O and the heat release, it is suggested that the secondary CH2O increase may contribute to damping of the acoustic instability, because of its out-of-phase relationship with pressure, while the first CH2O increase appears to drive the instability.",

The strength and structure of the CVP was quantified with vorticity and swirling strength (\u03bbci), showing that some regions of the flow with high shear are not necessarily accompanied by large scale bulk flow rotation and vice-versa. The OH PLIF measurement allows for correlation of the flame position with the dominant vortical structures, showing that the leeward flame branch lies slightly above, as well as, in the region between the CVP cores.",

Electric field is put on the absolute scale using the Laplacian field measured before breakdown. The results show that peak electric field during breakdown in the flame, approximately 40\u202fkV/cm, is significantly lower compared to that in room air, 75\u202fkV/cm, due to higher temperature of combustion products. In both cases, peak electric field is higher compared to DC breakdown field. Both in air and in the flame, the electric field follows the applied voltage before breakdown and decreases rapidly after breakdown, due to charge separation and plasma self-shielding. The electric field in air is compared with the predictions of an analytic model of ns pulse breakdown, showing good agreement between the predicted and the measured breakdown field. The model also predicts earlier breakdown as well as breakdown voltage reduction as the temperature is increased, in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. The use of the present ps four-wave mixing diagnostics for measurements of electric fields below \u223c20\u202fkV/cm in atmospheric pressure flames is challenging, due to low signal-to-noise. The sensitivity of the present diagnostics is controlled by the high temperature and low N2 fraction in the combustion product mixture, as well as by the limited bandwidth of the Stokes beam generated by the stimulated Raman cell, which provides access only to several rotational levels of nitrogen molecules. The present diagnostics will have much better sensitivity in high-pressure flames, since the four-wave mixing signal scales as the squared number density of nitrogen.",

     "abstract": "The outwardly propagating spherical flame (OPF) method is popularly used to measure the laminar flame speed (LFS). Recently, great efforts have been devoted to improving the accuracy of the LFS measurement from OPF. In the OPF method, several assumptions are made. For examples, the burned gas is assumed to be static and in chemical equilibrium. However, these assumptions may not be satisfied under certain conditions. Here we consider low-pressure and super-adiabatic propagating spherical flames, for which chemical non-equilibrium exists and the burned gas may not be static. The objective is to assess the chemical non-equilibrium effects on the accuracy of LFS measurement from the OPF method. Numerical simulations considering detailed chemistry and transport are conducted. Stoichiometric methane/air flames at sub-atmospheric pressures and methane/oxygen flames at different equivalence ratios are considered. At low pressures, broad heat release zone is observed and the burned gas cannot quickly reach the adiabatic flame temperature, indicating the existence of chemical non-equilibrium of burned gas. Positive flow in the burned gas is identified and it is shown to become stronger at lower initial pressure. Consequently, the LFS measurement from OPF at low pressures is not accurate if the burned gas is assumed to be static and at chemical equilibrium. For super-adiabatic spherical flames, the burned gas speed is found to be negative due to the local temperature overshoot at the flame front. Such negative speed of burned gas can also reduce the accuracy of LFS measurement. It is recommended that the direct method measuring both flame propagation speed and flow speed of unburned gas should be used to determine the LFS at low pressures or for mixtures with super-adiabatic flame temperature.",

However, under engine-relevant conditions, considerable reactivity may be present in the unburned mixture, introducing thus challenges due to couplings of auto-ignition and flame propagation phenomena. In this study, the propagation of transient, one-dimensional laminar flames into a reacting unburned mixture was investigated numerically in order to identify the parameters influencing the flame burning rate in the conduction-reaction controlled regime at constant pressure. It was found that the fuel chemical classification significantly influences the burning rate. More specifically, for hydrogen flames, the \u201cevolution\u201d of the burning rate does not depend on the initial unburned mixture temperature. On the other hand, for n-heptane flames that exhibit low temperature chemistry, the burning rate depends on the instantaneous temperature and composition of the unburned mixture in a coupled way. A new approach was developed allowing for the decoupling the flame chemistry from the ignition dynamics as well as for the decoupling of parameters influencing the burning rate, so that meaningful sensitivity analysis could be performed. It was determined that the burning rate is not directly affected by fuel specific reactions even in the presence of low temperature chemistry whose effect is indirect through the modification of the reactants composition entering the flame. The controlling parameters include but not limited to mixture conductivity, enthalpy, and the species composition evolution in the unburned mixture.",

     "abstract": "Laminar burning velocities are of great importance in many combustion models as well as for validation and improvement of chemical kinetic schemes. Determining laminar burning velocities with high accuracy is quite challenging and different approaches exist. Hence, a comparison of existing methods measuring and evaluating laminar burning velocities is of interest. Here, two optical diagnostics, high speed tomography and Schlieren cinematography, are simultaneously set up to investigate methods for evaluating laminar flame speed in a spherical flame configuration. The hypothesis to obtain the same flame propagation radii over time with the two different techniques is addressed. Another important aspect is the estimation of flame properties, such as the unstretched flame propagation speed and Markstein length in the burnt gas phase and if these are estimated satisfactorily by common experimental approaches. Thorough evaluation of the data with several extrapolation techniques is undertaken. A systematic extrapolation approach is presented to give more confidence into results generated experimentally. The significance of the linear extrapolation routine is highlighted in this context. Measurements of spherically expanding flames are carried out in two high-pressure, high-temperature, constant-volume vessels at RWTH in Aachen, Germany and at ICARE in Orleans, France. For the discussion of the systematic extrapolation approach, flame speed measurements of methane\u00a0/\u00a0air mixtures with mixture Lewis numbers moderately away from unity are used. Conditions were varied from lean to rich mixtures, at temperatures of 298\u2013373 K, and pressures of 1\u00a0atm and 5\u00a0bar.",

This is due to one limitation of these models: they need a closure for both the magnitude and the shape of the gradient (or scalar dissipation rate) of the progress variable, which is essential for an accurate prediction of the flame displacement speed. So far, solution methods for the aforementioned models require gradient information as an input, which is either modelled and non-generic, or extracted from a previous physical space flame solution for the analogous problem. The objective of this work is to provide a self-contained solution method for freely-propagating premixed flamelets in progress variable space, by solving an additional flamelet equation for the gradient of the progress variable. With this, the novel method provides both magnitude and shape of the gradient. Studying hydrogen-air and methane-air configurations, it is demonstrated that an accurate prediction of the laminar flame speed without the necessity for further input parameters can be obtained.",

     "abstract": "Many studies have examined the stoichiometric lengths of laminar gas jet diffusion flames. However, these have emphasized normal flames of undiluted fuel burning in air. Many questions remain about the effects of fuel dilution, oxygen-enhanced combustion, and inverse flames. Thus, the stoichiometric lengths of 287 normal and inverse gas jet flames are measured for a broad range of nitrogen dilution. The fuels are methane and propane and the ambient pressure is atmospheric. Nitrogen addition to the fuel and/or oxidizer is found to increase the stoichiometric lengths of both normal and inverse diffusion flames, but this effect is small at high reactant mole fraction. This counters previous assertions that inert addition to the fuel stream has a negligible effect on the lengths of normal diffusion flames. The analytical model of Roper is extended to these conditions by specifying the characteristic diffusivity to be the mean diffusivity of the fuel and oxidizer into stoichiometric products and a characteristic temperature that scales with the adiabatic flame temperature and the ambient temperature. The extended model correlates the measured lengths of normal and inverse flames with coefficients of determination of 0.87 for methane and 0.97 for propane.",

     "abstract": "During blowoff extinction of clear cast PMMA rods in concurrent axial flow for microgravity BASS-II experiments, a dynamic flame oscillation was observed after the flame was blown off of the stagnation point but briefly stabilized on the periphery of the rod. Complementary normal gravity experiments were conducted and flame oscillations were tracked using a high-speed color camera at 240 frames per second. The side-stabilized flame oscillated up and down the rod with increasing amplitude until the entire flame extinguished. In none of the BASS-II or normal gravity tests could the side-stabilized flames persist (Hopf subcritical bifurcation). Since the oscillations occurred even in microgravity, the mechanism does not depend on gravity. For the larger fuel radius tests, the flame developed asymmetric oscillation (pitchfork bifurcation). The oscillation time and the number of oscillations scale with the inverse square of the rod radius (\u223c Fourier no.) for the preheated microgravity rods. The average flame oscillation frequency is found to be linearly dependent on the mixed convective stretch rate (inverse of the flow time). The flame intensity varied in concert with its direction, either increasing or decreasing as the flame moved upstream or downstream, respectively. The oscillation frequency decreased as the amplitude increased and the flame slipped slightly farther down the rod with each oscillation. The flame speed increased with each subsequent oscillation, both flashing forward upstream and retreating downstream. The oscillations were found to closely follow a power law log-periodic dependence similar to those that describe systems approaching a critical point, such as diffusion-limited aggregation clusters, earthquakes, ruptures, and even stock market crashes. The net flame speeds varied linearly with ambient oxygen concentration, and linearly with the mixed convective stretch rate. Based on these observations, a mechanistic theory of the oscillations is described, and is consistent with the thermodiffusive instability.",

     "abstract": "The collisional history of ionized molecules in a molecular beam mass spectrometric flame experiment is target of our present investigation. Measurements in a double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (i2PEPICO) were performed at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) of the Paul Scherrer Institute to use the ion imaging device for separating the molecular beam ions from rethermalized ions. This enables the precise composition study of the individual types of ions. Results show clearly for the OH radical that the complete signal is obtained from the molecular beam, while the signal from other combustion compounds features additional rethermalized molecules. As for OH radicals, the mole fraction is reduced by sampling effects and contact with the ionization vessel walls significantly. Consequently, this leads to signal loss and lower mole fractions, when using ionization cross sections for the quantification. To improve on this, a beam fraction (BF) factor is presented. The factor describes the ratio of the separated beam signal without rethermalized ions with the total ion signal, consisting of the mass to charge ratio from the molecular beam and additional rethermalized ions. Since the detected OH radicals are solely from the molecular beam, a new method of comparing two molecular beam alignments using the OH to H2O signal ratio is presented. This method has a decent potential for the optimization of the quality of molecular beams. Finally, the separated beam signal (without the rethermalized ions) was used to determine mole fraction profiles for the OH radical using ionization cross sections. These profiles are in good agreement with model predictions of the USC-II and the Aramco Mech 2.0 mechanisms, while the total signal leads to factor of 12 smaller OH mole fractions.",

Decomposition of the very weak O\u2013CH3 bond in anisole (C6H5OCH3) by unimolecular decomposition yields the resonantly-stabilized phenoxy radical (C6H5O). This key intermediate species opens reaction routes to five-membered ring species, such as cyclopentadiene (C5H6) and cyclopentadienyl radicals (C5H5). Anisole is often discussed as model compound for lignin to study the phenolic-carbon structure in this natural polymer. Measured temperature profiles and mole fractions of many combustion intermediates give detailed information on the flame structure. A very comprehensive reaction mechanism from the literature which includes a sub-scheme for anisole combustion is used for species modeling. Species with the highest measured mole fractions (on the order of 10\u22123\u201310\u22122) are CH3, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CH2O, C5H5 (cyclopentadienyl radical), C5H6 (cyclopentadiene), C6H6 (benzene), C6H5OH (phenol), and C6H5CHO (benzaldehyde). Some are formed in the first destruction steps of anisole, e.g., phenol and benzaldehyde, and their formation will be discussed and with regard to the modeling results. There are three major routes for the fuel destruction: (1) formation of benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO), (2) formation of phenol (C6H5OH), and (3) unimolecular decomposition of anisole to phenoxy (C6H5O) and CH3 radicals. In the experiment, the phenoxy radical could be measured directly. The phenoxy radical decomposes via a bicyclic structure into the soot precursor C5H5 and CO. Formation of larger oxygenated species was observed in both flames. One of them is guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol), which decomposes into fulvenone. The presented speciation data, which contain more than 60 species mole fraction profiles of each flame, give insights into the combustion kinetics of anisole.",

The A-SURF program was employed to simulate the corresponding flame propagation processes. The results show that elevating the ignition energy increases the initial flame propagation speed and expands the range of flame trajectory which is affected by ignition energy, but the increase rates of the speed and range decrease with the ignition energy. Based on the trend of the minimum flame propagation speed during the initial period with the ignition energy, the minimum reliable ignition energy (MRIE) is derived by considering the initial flame propagation speed and energy conservation. It is observed that MRIE first decreases and then increases with the increasing equivalence ratio and monotonously decreases with increasing initial pressure and temperature. As the Lewis number rises, MRIE increases. The results also suggest that during the data processing of the spherical flame experiment, the accuracy of determination of laminar flame speeds can be enhanced when taking the flame radius influenced by MRIE as the lower limit of the flame radius range. Then the flame radius influenced by MRIE was defined as RFR. It can also be found that there exist nonlinear relationships between RFR and the equivalence ratio and Lewis number, and the RFR decreases with increasing initial pressure and temperature.",

However, there is little attention on ignition in fuel-stratified mixtures. In this study, one-dimensional numerical simulation is conducted to investigate the ignition and spherical flame kernel propagation in fuel-stratified n-decane/air mixtures. The emphasis is placed on assessing the effects of fuel stratification on the ignition kernel propagation and critical ignition condition. First, ignition and flame kernel propagation in homogeneous n-decane/air mixture are studied and different flame regimes are identified. The minimum ignition energy (MIE) of the homogeneous n-decane/air mixture is obtained and it is found to be very sensitive to the equivalence ratio under fuel-lean conditions. Then, ignition and flame kernel propagation in fuel-stratified n-decane/air mixture are investigated. The inner equivalence ratio and stratification radius are found to have great impact on ignition kernel propagation. The MIEs at different fuel-stratification conditions are calculated. The results indicate that for fuel-lean n-decane/air mixture, fuel stratification can greatly promote ignition and reduce the MIE. Six distinct flame regimes are observed for successful ignition in fuel-stratified mixture. It is shown that the ignition kernel propagation can be induced by not only the ignition energy deposition but also the fuel-stratification. Moreover, it is found that to achieve effective ignition enhancement though fuel stratification, one needs properly choose the values of stratification radius and inner equivalence ratio.",

     "abstract": "Laminar natural gas flames are investigated at engine-relevant thermochemical conditions where the ignition delay time \u03c4 is short due to very high ambient temperatures and pressures. At these conditions, it is not possible to measure or calculate well-defined values for the laminar flame speed sl, laminar flame thickness \u03b4l, and laminar flame time scale \u03c4 l = \u03b4 l / s l due to the explosive thermochemical state. Here, the corresponding reference values, sR, \u03b4R, and \u03c4 R = \u03b4 R / s R , that account for the effects of autoignition, are numerically estimated to investigate the enhancement of flame propagation, and the competition with autoignition that arises under nominally autoignitive conditions (characterised here by the number \u03c4/\u03c4R). Large values of \u03c4/\u03c4R indicate that autoignition is unimportant, values near or below unity indicate that flame propagation is not possible, and intermediate values indicate that a combination of both flame propagation and autoignition may be important, depending upon factors such as device geometry, turbulence, stratification, et cetera. The reference quantities are presented for a wide range of temperatures, equivalence ratios, pressures, and hydrogen concentrations, which includes conditions relevant to stationary gas turbine reheat burners and boosted spark ignition engines. It is demonstrated that the transition from flame propagation to autoignition is only dependent on residence time, when the results are non-dimensionalised by the reference values.

It is shown that the nominally autoignitive conditions enhance flame propagation, which may be an ameliorating factor for the onset of engine knock. The calculations are performed using a recently-developed, detailed 177 species mechanism for C0\u2013C3 chemistry that is derived from theoretical chemistry and is suitable for a wide range of thermochemical conditions as it is not tuned or optimised for a particular operating condition.",

Yet, hardly any studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of transient pressure rise on flame propagation as well as on the ignition of the unburned gas. In this study, the effects of unsteady pressure rise were parametrically studied using a one-dimensional reacting flow model in which the thermodynamic pressure variation is an independent variable and thus its rate of rise can be controlled. It was determined that large rates of pressure rise can significantly increase the mass burning flux of a laminar flame and that this modification becomes more pronounced at higher pressure and temperature conditions. Furthermore, it was shown that the development of ignition near a cold wall, for mixtures that exhibit negative temperature coefficient behavior, is very sensitive to rate of change of pressure. The near-wall ignition behavior was found also to be rather sensitive to the prevailing pressures and temperatures whose values control whether ignition will occur in the main-gas or within the thermal boundary layer.",

     "abstract": "Laminar one-dimensional (1D) flames in a stagnation flow stabilised at a wall are used to study flame\u2013wall interaction under diesel engine conditions. The thermochemical conditions correspond to that of the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) Spray\u00a0A reference case. A range of inflow velocities is considered, where the lowest inflow velocity is chosen such that the flame is detached from the inlet. The presence of a wall is shown to have a significant impact on the flame structure and emission formation. The 1D flame and homogeneous reactor results exhibit two distinct reaction zones due to low- and high-temperature chemistry (LTC and HTC, respectively). The burner-stabilised flames are overall dominated by autoignition for all inflow velocities. For the impinging jet flames, the response of the LTC reaction zone follows closely that of the burner-stabilised flames up to relatively high inflow velocities. The HTC reaction zone, however, deviates strongly from the burner-stabilised flames, already at low inflow velocities and quenches at high inflow velocities. A budget analysis revealed a strong contribution from diffusion in the HTC reaction zone, resulting in an increasing importance of deflagrative combustion as opposed to autoignition. This trend was attributed to enhanced strain rates at higher inlet velocity leading to higher gradients. Wall heat transfer was also investigated. The highest wall heat transfer rates were observed for mixtures between \u03a6 = 1.0 and \u03a6 = 1.5 and for inlet velocities just below the quenching limit. This was attributed jointly to the higher peak product temperatures for these mixtures and to their enhanced resilience to quenching under strain which leads to higher temperature gradients at the wall just before quenching. NO formation was studied. The highest NO formation was observed near \u03a6 = 1.0 , though the response to strain rate was different for stoichiometric and rich mixtures, which was attributed to differing NO formation pathways.",

     "abstract": "Stationary combustion regimes, their linear stability and extinction limits of stretched premixed flames in a narrow gap between two heat conducting plates are studied by means of numerical simulations in the framework of one-dimensional thermal-diffusion model with overall one-step reaction. Various stationary combustion modes including normal flame (NF), near-stagnation plane flame (NSF), weak flame (WF) and distant flame (DF) are detected and found to be analogous to the same-named regimes of conventional counterflow flames. For the flames stabilized in the vicinity of stagnation plane at moderate and large stretch rates (which are NF, NSF and WF) the effect of channel walls is basically reduced to additional heat loss. For distant flame characterized by large flame separation distance and small stretch rates intensive interphase heat transfer and heat recirculation are typical. It is shown that in mixture content / stretch rate plane the extinction limit curve has \u03b5-shape, while for conventional counterflow flames it is known to be C-shaped. This result is quite in line with recent experimental findings and is explained by extension of extinction limits at small stretch rates at the expense of heat recirculation. Analysis of the numerical results makes possible to reveal prime mechanisms of flame quenching on different branches of \u03b5-shaped extinction limit curve. Namely, two upper limits are caused by stretch and heat loss. These limits are direct analogs of the upper and lower limits on conventional C-shaped curve. Two other limits are related with weakening of heat recirculation and heat dissipation to the burner. Thus, the present study provides a satisfactory explanation for the recent experimental observations of stretched flames in narrow channel.",

Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted for propane, methane and two blends of hydrogen with methane as fuel gases, containing 20% and 40% of hydrogen by volume, respectively. It is found that the Le\u202f>\u202f1 flame blows-off via convection from the base of the flame (without formation of a neck) when the conditions for flame anchoring are not fulfilled. Le\u202f\u2264\u202f1 flames exhibit a necking phenomenon just before lean blow-off. This necking of the flame front is a result of the local reduction in mass burning rates causing flame merging and quenching of the thin flame tube formed. The structure of these flames at the necking location is found to be similar to tubular flames. It is found that extinction stretch rates for tubular flames closely match values at the neck location of bluff-body flames of corresponding mixtures, suggesting that excessive flame stretch is directly responsible for blow-off of the studied Le\u202f\u2264\u202f1 flames. After quenching of the neck, the upstream part forms a steady and stable residual flame in the wake of the bluff body while the downstream part is convected away.",

However, previous studies have focused on the analysis of smaller ketones and 3-pentanone, while the asymmetric 2-pentanone (methyl propyl ketone) has not gained much attention before. Considering ketones as possible fuels or additives, it is of particular importance to fully understand the combustion kinetics and the effect of the functional carbonyl group. Due to the higher energy density in a C5-ketone compared to the potential biofuel 2-butanone, the flame structure and the mole fraction profiles of species formed in 2-pentanone combustion are of high interest, especially to evaluate harmful species formations. In this study, a laminar premixed low-pressure (p\u202f=\u202f40 mbar) fuel-rich (\u03d5\u202f=\u202f1.6) flat flame of 2-pentanone has been analyzed by vacuum-ultraviolet photoionization molecular-beam mass-spectrometry (VUV-PI-MBMS) enabling isomer separation. Quantitative mole fraction profiles of 47 species were obtained and compared to a model consisting of an existing base mechanism and a newly developed high-temperature sub-mechanism for 2-pentanone. High-temperature reactions for 2-pentanone were adapted in analogy to 2-butanone and n-pentane, and the thermochemistry for 2-pentanone and the respective fuel radicals was derived by ab initio calculations. Good agreement was found between experiment and simulation for the first decomposition products, supporting the initial branching reactions of the 2-pentanone sub-mechanism. Also, species indicating low-temperature chemistry in the preheating zone of the flame have been observed. The present measurements of a 2-pentanone flame provide useful validation targets for further kinetic model development.",

As minor species are no longer transported with the flow, the time step is close to the values usually encountered for non-reactive flows, far beyond what is found in detailed chemistry.

Furthermore, a new kinetic model was proposed aimed at interpreting the high-temperature combustion chemistry for both ketones, which could satisfactorily predict the current flame speciation measurements. Experimental observations in combination with modeling analyses were used to reveal the similarities and differences between the compositions of the species pools of the two flames, with emphasis on the effects of the carbonyl functionality on pollutants formations. Besides some primary species which preserve fuel-specific features produced from initial steps of fuel consumptions, basic C1C4 intermediates also differ much between the two flames. More abundant intermediates were observed in the CPO flame because the cyclic fuel structure enables ring-opening processes followed by formations of C3 and C4 hydrocarbons which cannot be easily produced from the two isolated ethyl moieties in DEK under flame conditions. The consumptions of C3C4 hydrocarbons in the CPO flame further lead to larger C5C6 species which were under the detection limit in the DEK flame. In both flames, the tightly bonded carbonyl groups in the fuels tend to be preserved, leading to carbon monoxide through \u03b1-scissions of fuel-related acyl radicals. The carbonyl moieties in most detected C1C3 aldehydes and ketones form through oxidations of hydrocarbon species rather than directly originating from the fuels.",

Multistage diffusion flames of n-heptane, n-decane, and n-dodecane are established in an atmospheric counterflow burner. Planar laser-induced fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and thermometry are used to probe the structures of such flames. In the first flame zone, the majority of the fuel is partially oxidized via low-temperature peroxy chemistry. In the second flame zone, the intermediate species produced are further oxidized via intermediate-temperature chemistry. The two stages of the flame are coupled such that significant fuel and oxidizer leakage occur, respectively, from the first and second reaction zones. The fuel is then further consumed, in the second stage, after the radical pool is replenished by the oxidation of the intermediates. The structure of the n-alkane multistage flame is found to be consistent with that previously observed for acyclic ethers. Owing to the different classes of temperature-dependent chemistries dominating the first and second stages, the reaction zone structure of multistage diffusion flames is dramatically influenced by the reactant concentrations and flame temperatures. The first stage is relatively favored at lower temperatures whereas the second stage is favored at elevated temperatures. Moreover, near extinction where the flame temperature is low, the multistage flame dynamics are controlled by the first oxidation stage, governed by peroxy chemistry, whereas the second oxidation stage, governed by intermediate chemistry, is dominant near high-temperature ignition conditions. Finally, by doping the oxidizer with ozone, we demonstrate the role of ozone doping on the multistage flame structure and the existence of a separate low-temperature ozone-assisted burning mode.",

A series of 13 flames with different argon dilution was investigated to study effects of the specific fuel structure on the combustion chemistry. Full speciation analyses were performed for fuel-rich (\u03d5\u00a0=\u00a01.6) conditions by electron ionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (EI-MBMS). More than 35 species in the range of C0\u2013C7 were identified and quantified in these flames, resulting in \u223c450\u00a0mol fraction profiles.

Overall, the agreement of experiment and this model seems satisfactory but calls for further improvements regarding ester as well as hydrocarbon sub-mechanisms. It was noted that the unsaturation degree in the methyl esters affects the formation of hydrocarbons, that depend mainly on the structure of the respective base fuel, and of oxygenated intermediates. The methyl esters have different decomposition pathways leading to some specific oxygenated species. Both methyl esters promote the formation of formaldehyde and methanol, while acetic acid is significantly increased by the presence of MB.

Results show that, for hydrogen/air flames, the laminar flame speeds at high pressures increase due to the non-ideal equation of state (EoS), and is mainly due to the density modification of the initial mixture. Including the thermodynamic properties of heat capacity reduces the flame speed because of the correspondingly reduced adiabatic flame temperature.

     "abstract": "For non-premixed combustion, the steady laminar flamelet model (SLFM) and flamelet/progress variable approach (FPVA) are two popular methods for tabulating flamelet manifolds. Even if the two methods are used to tabulate and parameterize the same flamelet database, their results sometimes differ in the subsequent simulation. In this work, a novel perspective is provided to assess the performance of the SLFM and FPVA. Both approaches are compared with respect to their capabilities to capture tangential diffusion (TD) of the thermochemical state variables along iso-surfaces of mixture fraction. The relevance of TD effects is identified using generalized flamelet equations and regimes by comparing flamelet solutions with and without TD terms to a FTC (full transport and chemistry) solution of a well-known non-premixed coflow flame. It is found that TD effects can play an important role in entire mixture fraction space, even in the classical flamelet regime. This suggests that the ability to characterize TD effects is an important performance indicator for tabulation strategies. Thereafter, an a priori analysis is conducted comparing the results from the FPVA and SLFM (using the same flamelet database) with the FTC results. The results show that the FPVA is able to more accurately describe the thermochemical state and the flame structure than the SLFM. For a more detailed assessment of the two tabulation strategies, the TD terms reconstructed from the FPVA and SLFM are compared to those from the FTC results. It is found that the FPVA can capture a significant portion of TD effects, while the SLFM can hardly characterize TD effects. This particular capability allows the FPVA to describe chemistry-transport interaction and flame structure more accurately than the SLFM.",

A warm flame can also be formed by radiative extinction of a hot flame or ignition of a cool flame. A general \u20ac-shaped flammability diagram showing the burning limits of all three flame regimes at different oxygen mole fractions is obtained. The results show that thermal radiation, reactant concentration, temperature, and pressure all have significant impacts on the flammable regions of the three flame regimes. Increases in oxidizer temperature, oxygen concentration, and pressure shift the cool flame regime to higher stretch rates and cause the warm flame to have two extinction limits. At elevated temperatures, it is found that there is a direct transition between the hot flame and warm flame at low stretch rates. The results also show that, unlike the hot flame, the cool flame structure cannot be scaled by using pressure-weighted stretch rates due to the its significant reactant leakage and strong dependence of reactivity on pressure. The present results advance the understanding of near-limit flame dynamics and provide guidance for experimental observation of different flame regimes.",

To this end, a diffusive-thermal model characterized by constant gas density and transport coefficients is used for conditions at which flame liftoff is likely to occur. It is assumed that the incoming streams are of equal strain rates, that the fuel and oxidizer are supplied in stoichiometric proportion, and that the mass diffusivities of the reactants are equal, such that the resulting combustion field is symmetric with respect to the centerline extending from the splitter plate. The results indicate that the plate has a negligible effect on the edge flame unless the tip of the plate intrudes into the preheat zone of the curved premixed flame segment forming the edge flame. In an overall adiabatic system, the heat conducted from the flame to the plate is completely recirculated back to the reactants via the lateral surfaces of the plate, thus supporting an excess enthalpy flame in the near-wake. The average output heat flux, defined as the total heat output through the lateral surfaces of the plate divided by the characteristic length associated with the temperature variation along the plate, is identified as an appropriate measure to characterize the heat recirculation efficiency.",

     "abstract": "The paper presents the results of a fundamental experimental and theoretical study of Darrieus\u2013Landau, thermo-diffusive, instabilities in atmospheric explosions, and, on a smaller scale, in laboratory explosions in closed vessels. Pressure dependencies were sought to exploit the leading role of the Peclet number in the phenomena, so that similar Peclet numbers were achieved in both instances. However, in large atmospheric explosions large Peclet numbers were achieved by the size of the fireball, whereas in the closed vessel explosion it was achieved at a higher pressure by a much smaller flame, but because of the higher pressure, one endowed with a small laminar flame thickness. This study covers a much wider range of fuels and of pressures and the dependencies of the phenomena on both of these were carefully studied, although, for the atmospheric explosions, the data only covered propane and methane. The roles of both Markstein and Peclet numbers become clear and give rise to a more fundamental correlating parameter, a critical Karlovitz number, Kcl, for flame stability. This is based on the flame stretch rate, normalised by its multiplication by the chemical reaction time in a laminar flame. The experimentally measured dependencies of this key parameter on pressure and Markstein number are reported for the first time for so many different fuels. The critical Karlovitz number for flame stability decreases with increase in the strain rate Markstein number. As a result, it is possible to predict the extent of the unstable regime for laminar flames as a function of Masr and pressure. Such data can be used to estimate the severity of large scale atmospheric explosions. As Masr becomes highly negative, the regime of stability is markedly reduced.",

We also investigate the effects of hydrodynamic instability on quantities which are directly related to reaction rate closure models, such as flame surface density and stretch factor. A clear enhancement of turbulent flame speed can be observed for unstable flames, generally mitigated at higher turbulence intensity, which is attributed to a flame area increase induced by the characteristic cusp-like DL-induced corrugation, absent in stable flames, which occurs concurrently and in synergy with turbulent wrinkling. Unstable flames also exhibit, both numerically and experimentally, a different correlation between strain rate and flame curvature and are observed to give rise to a channeling of the induced flow in the fresh mixture.

Uedge showed a strong dependence on Le and flames images show that high (low) Le lead to weaker (stronger) edge-flame burning intensity. Uedge for single edge-flames scaled with the square root of the unburned to burned gas density ratio in a manner similar to nonpremixed flames whereas for premixed flames Uedge scaled linearly with density ratio. Edge-flames exhibited two extinction limits corresponding to a high-\u03c3 strain induced limit and a low-\u03c3 heat loss induced limit; a simple description of the low-\u03c3 limits was proposed and found to correlate well with experiments in twin-premixed, single-premixed, and nonpremixed edge-flames over more than a two-decade range of \u03ba.

These oscillating flames exist within a rather small range of equivalence ratios and inflow velocities, and move to mean locations closer to the flame holder as the reactant flow is increased.

In this study, the impact of a vortex on a premixed double flame, which consists of a coupled cool flame and a hot flame, is examined experimentally and computationally using dimethyl ether/oxygen/ozone mixtures. The double flame is first shown to occur near the extinction limit of the hot flame. The differences between steady-state cool flames, double flames, and hot flames are explored in a one-dimensional counterflow configuration. The transient interactions between double flames and impinging vortices are then investigated experimentally using a micro-jet and numerically in two-dimensional transient modeling. It is seen that the vortex can extinguish the near-limit hot flame locally, resulting in a lone cool flame. At higher vortex intensities, the cool flame may also be extinguished after the extinction of the hot flame. It is found that there can be three different transient flame structures coexisting at the same time: an extinguished flame hole, a cool flame, and a double flame. Moreover, flame curvature is shown to play an important role in determining whether the vortex weakens or strengthens the cool flame and double flame.",

To begin with, the quenching disk-gaps on the flammability limits were measured. In most cases, with the slight increase of the disk-gap, cellular flame structures could be generated. The initiation of such cellular structures could be explained by the thermally induced hydrodynamic instability, and it could be enhanced if the Lewis number was sufficiently small. When the disk-gap was sufficiently larger than a critical value (approximately 1.5 times the quenching distance), the cellular flame structure changed into a smooth one in the azimuthal direction. With a further increase of the disk-gap, the flame propagation velocities approached to constant values. These values were comparable to the laminar burning velocities except for the propane-rich conditions, in which much larger propagation velocities were observed. The flame stretch effects (coupled with Le-effects) within a narrow space were suspected as the reason. The structural transition of the premixed flame could be investigated successfully through various disk-gaps, from the smallest quenching-scale to the ordinary large scales via whole mesoscales including Hele\u2013Shaw scales.",

The experiments reveal that the longer tubes have higher instability compared to shorter tubes and the lower diameter tubes have higher instability compared to higher diameter tubes. The secondary instability leading to turbulent burning is found to be more sensitive to change in geometrical parameters compared to primary instability (oscillating flat flame). The secondary instability is re-stabilized for some intermediate burning velocity conditions even though lower and higher burning velocity conditions show secondary instability. The appearance of such re-stabilization is only observed for some specific lengths of the tube. Present experimental observations pertaining to the effect of geometrical parameters is found to be contradicting the theoretical predictions based on pressure coupling mechanism. To clear the underlying mechanism, analytical growth rate is computed considering velocity coupling mechanism. The computed growth rates correctly predict the effect of geometrical parameters on thermo-acoustic instability of downward propagating flames. This work provides further evidence to believe that the flame -acoustic coupling in downward propagating flames is due to flame area modulation (leading to heat release modulation) through action of acoustic acceleration.",

     "abstract": "Large-scale two-dimensional numerical simulations of thermodiffusively unstable, lean, premixed hydrogen flames have been performed using detailed finite rate chemistry to analyze flame intrinsic scales. The simulations feature a long integration time and large domain sizes to rule out effects of confinement on the dynamics of the flame front. For sufficiently large domain sizes, the total consumption speed of the flame is found to become independent of the domain size. An assessment of the characteristic scales of the flame front corrugation reveals the existence of a smallest and a largest flame intrinsic length scale. The smallest length manifests itself by local cusps, which lead to the formation of characteristic cells along the flame front. Their size is remarkably close to the most unstable wavelength predicted by a linear stability analysis of the flame front evolution in the linear regime. Independently of the domain size, a specific largest flame intrinsic structure, here referred to as flame finger, emerges from the interaction of multiple small-scale cusps. Thermodiffusively unstable flames are found to periodically form and destroy these flame fingers, but the formation of a global cusp that is known to emerge for purely hydrodynamically unstable flames is suppressed. The finite size of the largest scale fingers is explained by an instability in their movement. As they proceed towards the unburnt mixture, they tend to tilt and move laterally, thereby eventually being incorporated again by the rest of the flame. This behavior arises from the interaction of the flame fingers and the diverging velocity field ahead of them. Finally, the effect of equivalence ratio and unburnt gas temperature is investigated showing that flame fingers are found to develop only in case of a thermodiffusively unstable flame.",

The transition limit is decreased, that is, transition occurs is an easier manner, with increasing laser power input. While the flame propagates with increasing laser irradiation, the flame first exhibits a convex curvature owing to laser irradiation and then a concave structure is formed owing to buoyancy-induced flow. Two types of transition behavior caused by the concave structure and the convex structure are observed. The conflicting thermal-diffusive effect depending on Le leads to the differing transition behaviors. Based on an evaluation of the flame stretch effect attributed to the flame front curvature, it is confirmed that the Lewis number effect influences the transition criteria.",

Conceptually, the coupling between acoustics and flame dynamics can be divided into two categories: flame area fluctuations and changes in the local flame speed. The latter can be caused by the thermodynamic fluctuations that accompany an acoustic wave. This coupling is the focus of the present work. In this paper, we are concerned with the dynamics of laminar premixed flames involving large hydrocarbon species. Through high-fidelity numerical simulations, we investigate the flame response for a wide range of fuels and acoustic frequencies. The combustion of hydrogen and methane is considered for verification purposes and as baseline cases for comparison with two large hydrocarbon fuels, n-heptane and n-dodecane. We extract the phase and gain of the unsteady heat release response, which are directly related to the Rayleigh criterion and thus the stability of the system. For all fuels, we observe a local peak in the heat release gain. At high frequencies, we find that the fluctuations of the different species mass fractions decrease with the inverse of the acoustic frequency, leading to chemistry being \u201cfrozen\u201d in the high-frequency limit.

Also, an asymptotic analysis describing the problem far from the burner is able to capture the most important mechanisms controlling the flame, then the flame shape is determined and the dependence of the characteristic length scales on Peclet number (based on the burner properties), free stream velocity and stoichiometry is revealed. The results show that the flame width is proportional to the mass stoichiometric coefficient and reciprocal to the Peclet number the 1/4 power and free stream velocity the 3/4 power, and that the flame height is proportional to the square of the mass stoichiometric coefficient and to the square root of the ratio of Peclet number to free stream velocity. In addition, an asymptotic stability analysis reveals low-stretch flame extinction to be caused by reduction in fuel and oxidizer concentrations, which provides the range of the stoichiometric coefficient for stable regime, and at the same time the range of heat released.",

The configuration of an initially flat premixed flame interacting with a toroidal vortex is selected for the present study and reasons for this choice are discussed. Lewis number effects are assessed by comparing methane and propane flames. It is emphasized that the flame structure experiences very strong variations. In particular, the flame is shrunk (broadened) in the initial (final) period of the interaction with the vortex where strain rate (curvature) contribution of the stretch rate is predominant. By further analysing independently the thickness of the preheat and reaction zones, it is shown that for propane flames, not only the former but also the latter is significantly altered in zones where the flame curvature is negative. Changes in the reaction zone properties are further emphasized using CH* and OH* radicals. It is demonstrated that higher thermal diffusivity plays a significant role around curved regions, in which the enhanced diffusion of heat leads to a strong increase of CH* compared to OH* intensity. As an overall conclusion, this study suggests that it would be interesting to reassess the internal flame structure at lower and moderate Karlovitz numbers since changes might appear for a moderate vortex intensity with typical size much larger than the flame thickness.",

     "abstract": "An initially laminar premixed flame front accelerates extremely fast and may even trigger a detonation when propagating in a semi-open obstructed channel (one end of the channel is closed; the flame is ignited at the closed end and moves towards the open one). However, industrial and laboratory conduits oftentimes have both ends open, or vented, with a flame ignited at one of these ends. The latter constitutes the focus of the present work. Specifically, premixed flame propagation through a comb-shaped array of obstacles, in-built in a channel with both ends open, is studied by means of computational simulation of the reacting flow equations with fully-compressible hydrodynamics and an Arrhenius chemical kinetics. The parametric study includes various blockage ratios and spacing as well as the thermal expansion ratios, with oscillations of the burning rate observed in the majority of the cases, which conceptually differs from fast flame acceleration in semi-open channels. Such a difference is devoted to the fact that while the entire flame-generated jet-flow is pushed towards a single exit in a semi-open channel, in a channel with two ends open, this jet-flow is distributed between the upstream and downstream flows, thereby moderating flame propagation. The flame oscillations are nonlinear in all cases where they are observed. The oscillation period grows with the blockage ratio but decreases with the thermal expansion. The present results also support the recent experiments, modeling and theory of flames in obstructed channels with both ends open, which all yielded steady or quasi-steady flame propagation prior to the onset of flame acceleration. Indeed, the present oscillations can be treated as the fluctuations around a quasi-steady solution.",

Increasing Vin causes the high-temperature chemistry (HTC) flame to lift-off, while the low-temperature chemistry (LTC) flame is still attached. A unique speed SR associated with this transition is defined as the velocity at which the lifted height has the maximum sensitivity to changes in Vin. This transition velocity is negatively correlated with \u03c7. Near V i n = S R a tetrabrachial flame structure is observed consisting of a triple flame, stabilised by flame propagation into the products of an upstream LTC branch. Further increasing the inlet velocity changes the flame structure to a pentabrachial one, where an additional HTC ignition branch is observed upstream of the triple flame and ignition begins to contribute to the flame stabilisation. At large Vin, the LTC is eventually lifted, and the speed at which this transition occurs is insensitive to \u03c7. Further increasing Vin increases the contribution of ignition to flame stabilisation until the flame is completely ignition stabilised. Flow divergence caused by the LTC branch reduces the \u03c7 at the HTC branches making the HTC more resilient to \u03c7. The results are discussed in the context of identification of possible stabilisation modes in turbulent flames.",

     "abstract": "Most studies of triple flames in counterflowing streams of fuel and oxidizer have been focused on the symmetric problem in which the stoichiometric mixture fraction is 1/2. There then exist lean and rich premixed flames of roughly equal strengths, with a diffusion flame trailing behind from the stoichiometric point at which they meet. In the majority of realistic situations, however, the stoichiometric mixture fraction departs appreciably from unity, typically being quite small. With the objective of clarifying the influences of stoichiometry, attention is focused on one of the simplest possible models, addressed here mainly by numerical integration. When the stoichiometric mixture fraction departs appreciably from 1/2, one of the premixed wings is found to be dominant to such an extent that the diffusion flame and the other premixed flame are very weak by comparison. These curved, partially premixed flames are expected to be relevant in realistic configurations. In addition, a simple kinematic balance is shown to predict the shape of the front and the propagation velocity reasonably well in the limit of low stretch and low curvature.",

     "abstract": "Resistance to extinction by stretch is a key property of any flame, and recent work has shown that this property controls the overall structure of several important types of turbulent flames. Multiple definitions of the critical strain rate at extinction (ESR) have been presented in the literature. However, even if the same definition is used, different experiments report different extinction strain rates for flames burning the same fuel-air mixture at very similar temperatures using similarly constructed opposed-flow instruments. Here we\u00a0show that at extinction, all these flames are essentially identical, so one would expect that each would be assigned the same value of a parameter representing its intrinsic resistance-to-stretch-induced-extinction, regardless of the specifics of the experimental apparatus. A similar situation arises in laminar flame speed measurements since different apparatuses could result in different strain rate distributions. In that instance, the community has agreed to report the unstretched laminar flame speed, and methods have been developed to translate the experimental (stretched) flame speed into a universal unstretched laminar flame speed. We propose an analogous method for translating experimental measurements for stretch-induced extinction into an unambiguous and apparatus-independent quantity (ESR\u221e) by extrapolating to infinite opposing burner separation distance. The uniqueness of the flame at extinction is shown numerically and supported experimentally for twin premixed, single premixed, and diffusion flames at Lewis numbers greater than and less than one. A method for deriving ESR\u221e from finite-boundary experimental studies is proposed and demonstrated for methane and propane experimental diffusion and premixed single flame data. The two values agree within the range of ESR differences typically observed between experimental measurements and simulation results for the traditional ESR definition.",

Both positive and negative Uedge were observed depending on dilution level, Zst and \u03c3. At low Zst only continuous flames were observed whereas at sufficiently high Zst, where a shift from more oxygen-deficient to more fuel-deficient conditions at the reaction zone occurs, broken structures characteristic of low Lewis number premixed flames were observed which enabled combustion under conditions where no flames could be sustained at lower Zst, even for the same dilution level. At sufficiently high \u03c3 these broken structures could transition from advancing edge-flames to isolated, stationary flames, particularly for highly-diluted mixtures. These findings were in surprisingly good agreement with theoretical predictions. Appropriate scalings of these behaviors for different mixtures based on computed 1D extinction strain rates were identified. Nonpremixed H2N2/O2N2 edge-flames have profoundly different responses to Zst than corresponding hydrocarbon edge-flames, which is shown to be due to differences in the chemistry and Lewis numbers of the two fuels.",

We designed a systematic experiment to test the hypothesis that the oscillation is driven by competition between the positive buoyancy of flame and the negative buoyancy of a fuel stream heavier than the ambient air. The positive buoyancy was examined with various flame temperatures by changing fuel mole fraction, and the negative buoyancy was investigated with various fuel densities. The density of the coflow was also varied within a certain range by adding either helium or carbon dioxide to air, to study how it affected the positive and negative buoyancies at the same time. As a result, we found that the range of oscillation was well-correlated with the positive and the negative buoyancies; the former stabilized the oscillation while the latter triggered instability and became a source of the oscillation. Further measurements of the flow fields and OH radicals evidenced the important role of the negative buoyancy on the oscillation, detailing a periodic variation in the unburned flow velocity that affected the displacement of the flame.",

The former was observed in the jet-developing region and the latter in the jet-developed region. Because the decreasing behavior of liftoff height with jet velocity has not been observed at ambient temperature, the present study focuses on decreasing liftoff height behavior. To elucidate the physical mechanism underlying the U-shaped behavior, numerical simulations of reacting jets were conducted by adopting a skeletal mechanism. The U-shaped behavior was related to the buoyancy. At small jet velocities, the relative importance of the buoyancy over convection was strong and the flow field was accelerated in the downstream region to stabilize the lifted flame. As the jet velocity increased, the relative importance of buoyancy decreased and the liftoff height decreased. As the jet velocity further increased, the flame stabilization was controlled by jet momentum and the liftoff height increased.",

Traditionally OH chemiluminescence (OH*) is used to trace heat release rate (HRR) in H2/air flames, but its accuracy as a tracer has not been assessed. Lean premixed H2/air cellular tubular flames are a good test case to evaluate HRR tracers due to the presence of highly reactive flame cells surrounded by regions of near extinction. Comparing the calculated heat release rate to OH* concentration, one finds that [OH*] profiles correlate with the regions of high reactivity (flame cells) but the correlation fails in the low reactivity regions where the HRR is much higher than the [OH*] value indicates. Alternate HRR tracers including [H] and pixel-by-pixel products of [O2]x[H], [OH]x[H2], and [O]x[H2] are analyzed with detailed numerical simulations. The chosen products derive from the main chain reaction steps that contribute to overall HRR in lean, premixed H2/air flames. Findings suggest that [H] is an accurate yet simple way of tracking HRR.

     "abstract": "A numerical and experimental study is performed to investigate soot formation from jet fuel in a laminar coflow diffusion flame. The combustion chemistry of the fuel is simulated using (1) the MURI jet fuel surrogate (Dooley et al. 2012) with a modestly reduced Ranzi mechanism (Ranzi et al. 2012), and (2) the recently proposed HyChem model (Xu et al. 2018) combined with the KAUST PAH mechanism 2 (Wang et al. 2013). The two reaction mechanisms are coupled with a sectional soot model to simulate a coflow diffusion flame of methane doped with the MURI jet fuel surrogate. The combined laser extinction and two-angle elastic light scattering method is used to perform non-intrusive in situ measurements of soot volume fraction, primary particle diameter and number density. The good agreement including soot particle size and number density between the experimental data and the simulation results computed with the reduced Ranzi mechanism demonstrate the robustness of the soot model to changes in fuel composition, as the model parameters are unchanged with a previous numerical study of soot formation of n-propylbenzene/n-dodecane mixtures (Zhang and Thomson, 2018). The computation with the combined HyChem/KAUST mechanism predicts similar results as the computation with the detailed chemistry of the reduced Ranzi mechanism for fuel breakdown, thus the basic premise of the HyChem model that the fuel decomposition process can be greatly simplified with the lumped reaction steps is supported. The results also show that by adding a PAH growth scheme to the HyChem model, the approach can be used to predict soot formation from jet fuel combustion in a laminar coflow diffusion flame. Finally, the dependency of the soot prediction on PAH chemistry is discussed and it is suggested that more experimental data is needed to validate the PAH mechanism and improve the predictive accuracy of the model.",

Soot samples from a flame fueled with C2H4 are taken thermophoretically at different heights above the burner (HAB), their size and nano-structure are analysed through TEM. The experimental results suggest that after inception, the nascent soot particles coagulate and coalesce to form larger primary particles (\u202f\u223c\u202f5 to 15\u00a0nm). As these primary particles travel along the centreline, they grow mainly due coagulation and condensation and a layer of amorphous hydrocarbons (revealed by HRTEM) forms on their surface. This amorphous layer appears to promote the aggregation of primary particles to form fractal structures. Fast carbonisation of the amorphous layer leads to a graphitic-like shell around the particles. Further graphitization compacts the primary particles, resulting in a decrease of their size. Towards the flame tip the primary particles decrease in size due to rapid oxidation. A detailed population balance model is used to investigate the mechanisms that are important for prediction of primary particle size distributions. Suggestions are made regarding future model development efforts. Simulation results indicate that the primary particle size distributions are very sensitive to the parameterization of the coalescence and particle rounding processes. In contrast, the average primary particle size is less sensitive to these parameters. This demonstrates that achieving good predictions for the average primary particle size does not necessarily mean that the distribution has been accurately predicted.",

An unprecedented level of control was implemented by selecting flames with a self-similar structure to ensure that the normalized temperature-time history experienced by the reactants was the same, regardless of pressure. The self-similarity was verified by suitably rescaling the transverse coordinate with respect to a characteristic diffusion length. At constant Tmax, the soot volume fraction increases approximately by two orders of magnitude as the pressure is raised from 1\u00a0atm to 4\u00a0atm, and by one to two additional orders of magnitude with an additional doubling of the pressure to 8\u00a0atm. At constant pressure, the soot load spans two to three orders of magnitude and soot formation exhibits increased sensitivity to temperature as the pressure is raised. Soot inception occurs near the flame, with an increase in soot concentration that becomes steeper at higher Tmax. The increase is accompanied by a decrease in the dispersion exponent that is suggestive of dehydrogenation and aging of the particles and is sharper at higher Tmax. Soot experiences continuous growth in a monotonically decreasing temperature field until it is convected away radially at the stagnation plane, with essentially no opportunity for oxidation. Evidence of two distinct mechanisms for soot formation was found: the classic high temperature, high activation energy process affecting soot formed in the vicinity of the flame and followed by dehydrogenation; and a relatively low-temperature, zero activation energy process, associated with the increase in volume fraction at low-temperatures in proximity of the stagnation plane. The latter is tentatively attributed to dimerization of aromatics, as revealed by the concurrent increase in the dispersion index corresponding to an increase in the particle hydrogen content.",

Over the last two decades, the focus of research has been on the development of the large eddy simulation (LES) approach, which leveraged the vast increase in computing power to dramatically improve predictive accuracy. Even with the anticipated increase in supercomputing capabilities, the use of LES in design is limited by its high computational cost. Moreover, to aid decision making, such LES computations have to be augmented to estimate underlying uncertainties in simulation components. At the same time, other changes are happening across industries that build or use combustion devices. While efficiency and emissions reduction are still the primary design objectives, reducing cost of operation by optimizing maintenance and repair is becoming an important segment of the enterprise. This latter quest is aided by the digitization of combustors, which allows collection and storage of operational data from a host of sensors over a fleet of devices. Moreover, several levels of computing including low-power hardware present on board the combustion systems are becoming available. Such large data sets create unique opportunities for design and maintenance if appropriate numerical tools are made available.

The autoignition kernel grows in both size and the OH-fluorescence intensity as it convects downstream. An autoignition kernel transitions into a propagating flame kernel, which quickly gets distorted and elongated in the direction of the principal expansion strain rate to form a flame fragment. Neighboring flame fragments merge with each other and with the downstream diffusion flame via edge-flame propagation. Merging of upstream flame fragments with the downstream diffusion flame results in an upstream advancement of the diffusion-flame front. The diffusion flame front is intrinsically unsteady because of the rather random formation and evolution of autoignition kernels, flame kernels and flame fragments, presumably due to the stochastic velocity, the strain rate and mixture-fraction oscillations.",

In the current paper, the auto-ignition of a transient propane jet-in-hot coflow was studied with high-speed OH* chemiluminescence imaging and high-speed Rayleigh scattering for the simultaneous determination of mixture fraction, mixture temperature and scalar dissipation rate immediately prior to the onset of auto-ignition. A variation of the coflow temperature showed a pronounced temperature dependence of the auto-ignition location and time, and the temperature sensitivity was higher than for a comparable methane test case from the literature. This is explained by the lower sensitivity of propane ignition delay times to the local strain rate in comparison to methane. The Rayleigh measurements however showed that the formation mechanism of auto-ignition kernels is similar for propane and methane.

Regarding the formation of flame kernel, it is found that the convection dominates the propagation of its downstream edge. The simulated initial downstream and radial flame propagation compare well with OH-PLIF images from the experiment. Additionally, when the spark is deposited at off-centerline locations, the flame first propagates downstream and then back upstream from the other side of the stoichiometric iso-surface. At the leading edge location, the chemical source term is larger than others in magnitude, indicating its role in the flame propagation. The time evolution of flame edge position and the final lift-off height are compared with measurements and generally good agreement is observed.

     "abstract": "This paper reviews the opportunities and challenges for combustion research directed towards the production of valuable chemicals. In the main, the production of heat and power are not considered here \u2013 the primary focus is on processes in which the desired products are the combustion products themselves, or products that are created by virtue of reaction in a combustion environment. The processes considered comprise three main classes: (1) Direct flame processes, including acetylene production, partial oxidation of methane, the Claus process for sulfur production, and material syntheses of nanocarbons and inorganics. (2) Catalytic partial oxidations that are conducted with the objective of avoiding complete combustion. (3) Chemical looping processes, based on chemical looping combustion in which a metallic oxide acts as an oxygen carrier, undergoing cyclical oxidation/reduction steps.Some of the processes being considered have been used in industry for many years. Despite, or perhaps because of, this there are opportunities for combustion research to lead to significant improvements in the operation of such processes. This point is illustrated via a detailed review of the science and technology of the catalytic combustion of ammonia over platinum that is the basis of the production of nitric acid and nitrate fertilisers on huge scale worldwide.Other processes remain at early stages of development, where opportunities for innovation are abundant. With many such opportunities involving catalysis, the status of detailed kinetic (microkinetic) modelling of catalytic process is also reviewed. This area may appear familiar to many combustion kinetic modellers but closer inspection reveals a wealth of chemical and computational complexity that transcends familiarity. The review in this area is necessarily superficial but does draw the links to traditional practice in the combustion community while also highlighting new techniques and approaches.",

     "abstract": "With growing concerns over greenhouse gas emission, novel combustion technologies are timely and critical. Fossil fuels will continue to contribute a large fraction of energy production in the near and intermediate future, making carbon capture and storage an important part of the solution. System studies show that oxy-combustion can play an important role in capturing CO2 efficiently when applied to power systems, because its efficiency and electricity prices are competitive with other low carbon energy. Gas-phase oxy-combustion, diluted with CO2 to control the flame temperature, utilizes conventional \u201coff-the-shelve\u201d technology. However, the combustion process exhibits characteristics different than those of air combustion because of the chemical activity of CO2, which impacts the combustor design. We summarize these characteristics. It also suffers from an energy penalty associated air separation. Alternative oxygen production technologies includes ion-transport membranes, and chemical looping using metal oxides as oxygen carriers. These technologies, while still under development, can couple oxygen separation and combustion in one process, i.e., process intensification. While an extensive knowledge base exists for gas phase oxy-combustion, these alternative technologies that rely on surface and electrochemical processes are still in their early stages. We review some fundamentals related to defect chemistry, surface and electrochemical reaction models, and their coupling with internal diffusion and external heat and mass transport, the associated rate-limiting steps and how they impact reactor design and performance. The discussion is used to explain the choice of oxygen carriers for chemical looping, and different reactor designs are summarized. Recent progress in material synthesis and chemistry show promising trends especially using perovskites, mixed oxides and dual-phase materials, and asymmetric structures for membranes and oxygen carriers. ITMs and CLC are dual-use technologies as they lend themselves naturally to water and CO2 splitting and the production of fuels and chemicals, but different materials and reactors are needed. They also present opportunities to integrate/hybridize fossil fuel systems with alternative energy sources for power and fuel production.",

     "abstract": "Gas-phase synthesis of nanoparticles enables production of high-purity materials with well-controlled properties in continuous flow processes. It is an established technology for a couple of (mostly inorganic) commodities with more or less specific materials characteristics. However, increasing process understanding and control provides a chance for scale-up of highly specialized lab-scale technologies used for the manufacturing of unique materials to industrial scale. Nanoparticles with adjustable composition and size distributions are of interest for a wide variety of applications from coatings to electronics to functional materials, e.g., for energy conversion and storage. For the synthesis of materials with desired properties, the reaction conditions must be well controlled. Understanding the decomposition kinetics and mechanisms of vaporized precursor compounds, cluster formation, and the potential interaction with bath gases and flame chemistry is a prerequisite for a targeted synthesis of materials. The scientific challenges concerning the precursor chemistry and particle formation and the experimental and theoretical approaches to overcome them have a large overlap with those in combustion science. Kinetics experiments are carried out in shock-tube reactors with optical and mass spectrometric detection of intermediate and product species, and in flow reactors with laser-based detection of temperature and species concentration as well as molecular-beam sampling techniques. Reaction conditions such as temperature, intermediate species concentration and particle size must be determined in situ in lab-scale nanoparticle reactors and the definition of standardized experiments that allow to build-up large data bases for model development is important. The scale-up to pilot-plant-scale based on experimentally validated simulations finally helps to prove the viability of new technologies and their application on mass markets such as materials for batteries or catalysis.",

     "abstract": "This paper focuses on the potential use of ammonia as a carbon-free fuel, and covers recent advances in the development of ammonia combustion technology and its underlying chemistry. Fulfilling the COP21 Paris Agreement requires the de-carbonization of energy generation, through utilization of carbon-neutral and overall carbon-free fuels produced from renewable sources. Hydrogen is one of such fuels, which is a potential energy carrier for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. However, its shipment for long distances and storage for long times present challenges. Ammonia on the other hand, comprises 17.8% of hydrogen by mass and can be produced from renewable hydrogen and nitrogen separated from air. Furthermore, thermal properties of ammonia are similar to those of propane in terms of boiling temperature and condensation pressure, making it attractive as a hydrogen and energy carrier. Ammonia has been produced and utilized for the past 100 years as a fertilizer, chemical raw material, and refrigerant. Ammonia can be used as a fuel but there are several challenges in ammonia combustion, such as low flammability, high NOx emission, and low radiation intensity. Overcoming these challenges requires further research into ammonia flame dynamics and chemistry. This paper discusses recent successful applications of ammonia fuel, in gas turbines, co-fired with pulverize coal, and in industrial furnaces. These applications have been implemented under the Japanese \u2018Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP): Energy Carriers\u2019. In addition, fundamental aspects of ammonia combustion are discussed including characteristics of laminar premixed flames, counterflow twin-flames, and turbulent premixed flames stabilized by a nozzle burner at high pressure. Furthermore, this paper discusses details of the chemistry of ammonia combustion related to NOx production, processes for reducing NOx, and validation of several ammonia oxidation kinetics models. Finally, LES results for a gas-turbine-like swirl-burner are presented, for the purpose of developing low-NOx single-fuelled ammonia gas turbine combustors.",

At the detection wavelength, we measured the temperature dependence of the absorption cross-sections of C3H5 and C3H5I. Rate coefficient for the self-recombination reaction of allyl radicals showed a small negative temperature dependence and no noticeable fall-off behavior over 1.15\u20131.96\u202fbar giving a mean value of k C 3 H 5 + C 3 H 5 = ( 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 ) \u00d7 10 \u2212 11 c m 3 molecul e \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 .

     "abstract": "Methanol (CH3OH) is the simplest alcohol and is considered to be a future fuel, produced by solar-driven reduction of carbon dioxide. The reaction of methanol and hydroxyl radicals is important in both combustion and atmospheric systems because this reaction is the dominant consumption pathway for methanol oxidation. Hydrogen abstraction at the CH3 or OH site of CH3OH leads to different radical intermediates. The relative importance of these two channels is critical for combustion modeling as the subsequent chemistries of the product radicals (CH3O and CH2OH) are markedly different. In this work, we measured overall rate coefficients for the reaction of methanol (CH3OH), methanol-d3 (CD3OH) and methanol-d1 (CH2DOH) with OH radicals over the temperature range of 900\u202f\u2212\u202f1300\u00a0K and pressures near 1.3 atm by employing shock tube/UV laser absorption technique.

Ar-diluted mixtures of 200\u202fppm aromatics in stoichiometric O2 were shock-heated to temperatures of 1513\u20131877\u202fK and pressures of about 1.2\u00a0atm, where quantitative and time-resolved concentration time-histories of OH were measured by narrow-linewidth laser absorption using a novel solid-state laser near 308.6\u202fnm, at the peak of the Q1(5) transition of the OH A-X (0,0) rovibronic band. The use of the Q1(5) transition improved the detection sensitivity of OH by a factor of 2.2, as compared to the R1(5) transition utilized in most previous OH absorption measurements. The resulting OH time-history data accurately resolved the fine details in multiple stages of oxidation of these aromatics, e.g. the initial decomposition of fuel, the subsequent H-abstraction and radical scavenging, and the final radical surge and onset of ignition, thereby providing multiple valuable kinetics targets for validation and improvement of modern reaction models. Three comprehensive reaction models of aromatics combustion from recent studies were evaluated based on the current experimental results. Key reactions governing the OH time-histories were identified, and further studies on selected reaction rate constants were suggested to improve these models. To our knowledge, the current work presents the first quantitative measurements of OH time-histories in the oxidation of benzene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene, and hence provides a critical and unique contribution to the database needed for development and optimization of modern reaction kinetic models regarding aromatics combustion.",

Reactivity of the GCI blend was compared with experimental measurements of two surrogates: a multi-component surrogate (MCS) and a two-component primary reference fuel (PRF 77). Both surrogates capture the reactivity of the fuel quite well at high and intermediate temperatures. The MCS does a better job of emulating the fuel reactivity at low temperatures, where PRF 77 is more reactive than the GCI blend. Ignition delay times of the two surrogates are also simulated using detailed chemical kinetic models, and the simulations agree well with the experimental findings.

The key species produced from the pyrolysis process were measured by gas chromatography as a function of the shock temperature. It was found that despite the compositional complexity of the fuel, the major pyrolysis products include a handful of species. They are ethylene, methane, hydrogen, propene, 1-butene, iso-butene, benzene, toluene, acetylene, 1,3-butadiene, allene and propyne, etc. Among them, ethylene is the most dominant species. The HyChem model recently proposed for the same fuel was used for prediction and comparison with the experimental data. Considering that the HyChem model was developed using shock tube and flow reactor data collected over a range of conditions significantly different from those of the current study, the agreement between the current experiment and model prediction is satisfactory. A Monte Carlo analysis was carried out that examined the sensitivities of the model predictions to the rate parameters. The results indicate that the effects of the uncertainties of A factors and those of activation energy are of significance in different temperature regions. Moreover, the low temperature region is dominated by the fuel pyrolysis reactions, while the high temperature region is dominated by the foundational chemistry which describes the pyrolysis and oxidation of fuel pyrolysis products.",

     "abstract": "The reaction of hydroxyl radicals with fuel components and combustion intermediates is one of the most important steps for fuel oxidation. These reactions constitute the primary consumption pathways for hydrocarbons at atmospheric and combustion conditions. Depending on the chemical structure and thermodynamic conditions, different chemical pathways are available for the reaction of OH with hydrocarbons. Primarily, OH may abstract an H atom directly or may undergo addition reaction forming a complex which may produce various bimolecular products. The knowledge of the branching fractions and competition of these channels is crucial to understand the combustion behavior of practical fuels. In this work, we report experimental study on the reaction of two C2 hydrocarbons, ethylene and acetylene, with OH radicals and combine it with our previous work on ethane to draw conclusions on the effect of CC bond type on the competition between association and abstraction/bimolecular channels over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. Experiments were carried out behind reflected shock waves over 800\u20131300\u202fK and the reaction progress was monitored by probing OH radicals using UV laser absorption near 306\u202fnm. To discern association channel from CH bond breaking channels (direct H-abstraction and bimolecular channels), reaction of OH radicals was studied with ethylene, deuterated ethylene, acetylene and deuterated acetylene. We previously showed that ethane\u202f+\u202fOH reaction expectedly follows solely direct H-abstraction pathway. Here, we found that ethylene\u202f+\u202fOH reaction presents a competition between association, bimolecular channels and direct H-abstraction of the vinylic H atoms, where association pathway becomes negligible for T\u202f>\u202f700\u202fK. On the other hand, acetylene is found to react with OH mainly through the association channel which dominates till temperatures as high as 1050\u202fK.",

     "abstract": "The progress in catalysis research has recently led to new conversion pathways of cellulosic biomass to a range of tetrahydrofurans, which are potentially viable as biofuels. However, combustion behavior of these tetrahydrofurans is not well understood. Considering this as the main focus, the present study reports for the first time the formulation of a detailed chemical kinetic model of 3-methyltetrahydrofuran (3-MTHF). The developed model includes both its low- and high-temperature chemistry and is able to explain the reason for higher reactivity of 3-MTHF than 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF). In order to assess the prediction capability of the proposed model, ignition delay measurements of 3-MTHF were performed in two different combustion reactors, rapid compression machine and shock tube. The ignition delay times were measured for 3-MTHF/air mixtures spanning a wide range of temperatures from 615\u00a0K to 1256\u00a0K, at pressures of 10\u00a0bar, 20\u00a0bar, and 40\u00a0bar, and varying equivalence ratio of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. The proposed model compares well against new and already existing experimental data. A detailed chemical analysis of the auto-ignition of 3-MTHF reveals that the presence of two secondary \u03b1-carbon centers and hence four \u03b1-C\u2013H bonds leads to its substantially higher reactivity in comparison to its structural isomer 2-MTHF, which possesses one secondary \u03b1- and one tertiary \u03b1-carbon center.",

     "abstract": "OH\u202f+\u202fmolecules are an important class of reactions in combustion and atmospheric chemistry. Consequently, numerous studies have measured rate constants for these processes over an extended temperature range. A large majority of these experimental studies have utilized the decay of [OH] profiles (monitored either by absorption or laser-induced fluorescence) to obtain total rate constants. However, there are limited direct measurements of channel specific rate constants in this important class of reactions, particularly at combustion relevant temperatures. In the present experiments, we have directly measured site-specific rate constants for abstraction of the secondary CH bond in OH\u202f+\u202fC3H8 at high temperatures. Atomic resonance absorption spectrometry (ARAS) was used to monitor the formation of H-atoms from shock-heated mixtures of tert-butylhydroperoxide and C3H8 at high temperatures. Simulations for the experimental H-atom profiles are sensitive only to abstraction of the secondary CH bond leading to unambiguous measurements of the rate constants for this reaction. Over the T-range, 921\u202fK\u202f<\u202fT\u202f<\u202f1146\u202fK, rate constants from the present experiments for OH\u202f+\u202fC3H8\u202f\u2192\u202fH2O\u202f+\u202fi-C3H7 can be represented by the Arrhenius expression,k = ( 3.935 \u00b1 1.387 ) \u00d7 10 \u2212 11 exp ( \u2212 1681 \u00b1 362 K / T ) c m 3 molecul e \u2212 1 s \u2212 1Simulations of the lower temperature data (T\u202f<\u202f1000\u202fK) indicate that the H-atom profiles are also influenced to a minor extent by the thermal dissociation of iso-propyl, i-C3H7\u202f\u2192\u202fH\u202f+\u202fC3H6, at short time-scales.

A laser absorption technique was utilized to measure H2O time-histories, and the detailed kinetics mechanism (AramcoMech2.0) was selected among various models from the literature based on its a priori agreement with the experimental data in the present study. Sensitivity and rate-of-production analyses were performed and showed that the C2H5OH\u2192C2H4+\u202fH2O (R1) decomposition pathway is almost the sole reaction contributing to H2O formation at the early times under the present conditions, allowing an a priori direct measurement of its rate coefficient k1.

Secondary chemical reactions taking place in the thermal decomposition have very low influence in the H2O formation during the time-frame selected, leading to an uncertainty for k1 of approximately 20%.

Laser absorption techniques were used to measure initial fuel and time-resolved temperature, CO2, H2O, and C2H4. Sampled-gas GC analysis was used in conjunction with a variable-test-time shock tube facility to obtain quasi-time-resolved measurements of n-heptane, C2H4, CO, H2, C3H6, and CO2 in the same experiments. Measurements obtained using both techniques are compared to each other, and to initial results predicted by a detailed kinetic model using the experimentally measured pressure trace to constrain the model. Discrepancies between measured and predicted ignition delay times indicate the overestimation of three primary RO2 isomerization reaction rates. The three reaction rates were modified to improve agreement of modeled ignition delay times with the measurements. Final results produced using the modified mechanism are compared to the experimental results; the comparison shows close agreement between the two experimental measurement techniques, and measured species yields confirm the low-temperature reaction pathways that govern n-heptane decomposition and C2H4, CO, H2, and C3H6 production.",

     "abstract": "Shock-tube ignition delay time data have recently been called into question on the basis of possible hydrocarbon impurities that may serve to artificially accelerate ignition delay times. To assess potential sources of impurities, systematic tests were performed in highly dilute H2/O2/Ar and CH4/O2/Ar mixtures using H2O laser absorption at 1.388\u202f\u00b5m and OH* emission at 307\u202fnm near 1\u00a0atm and between 1257 and 2108\u202fK. Factors investigated included common sources of impurity, namely shock-tube cleanliness, Ar purity, diaphragm fragments, leftover cleaning substances, turbopumping duration, and mixing tank cleanliness, but only mixing tank cleanliness was found to have any quantifiable effect on measured ignition delay times. Rate measurements of H\u202f+\u202fO2\u21c6OH\u202f+\u202fO using H2O time-histories were found to be unperturbed by impurity effects and were in excellent agreement with the Hong et al. measurement. Mixing tank impurities were found to perturb ignition delay times of a stoichiometric H2/O2 mixture in 98% Ar but had no effect on a stoichiometric CH4/O2 mixture in 99% Ar. Even with clean mixing tank conditions, H2/O2 ignition delay times in 98% and 99% Ar displayed a 25\u201330% discrepancy with predicted values but showed remarkable agreement with two sets of historical data. This discrepancy was modeled by including trace hydrocarbons (within certified purity levels) in simulations. For less-dilute (\u2264\u202f94% Ar) H2/O2 mixtures, literature data seem to agree rather well and were insensitive to trace hydrocarbons according to simulations. Furthermore, experimental and modeling evidence strongly suggests that almost every hydrocarbon C1 and higher is insensitive to impurities with respect to ignition delay times. It is thus concluded that the only data for which an impurity effect seems to exist is for highly dilute (98\u201399% Ar) H2/O2 data, while H2/O2 data below 94% dilution and almost every hydrocarbon C1 and greater are insensitive to common impurities.",

Our results show that cyclopentanone undergoes decomposition, under the present experimental conditions, via reaction channels that produce CO almost exclusively. A recent ab initio study by Zaras et\u00a0al. revealed that cyclopentanone decomposes to produce CO and ethylene by two channels: ring-opening to form a di-radical which subsequently decomposes, and concerted elimination to produce CO and C2H4 directly; their predicted rate constants are much slower than literature experimental data. To resolve the rate constant discrepancy and to determine whether keto-enol tautomerism plays a significant role, we performed master equation simulations which produced results in good agreement both with the previous ab initio study and with the experimental data obtained in the present work.",

DEM contains C\u2212C bonds and can form ethylene via \u03b2-scission, which potentially increases its sooting tendency. Since DEM is rarely studied, however, kinetic modeling attempts are forced to rely on rate constant analogies. Therefore, we employ high level CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T+D)Z//B2PLYPD3BJ/6-311++(d,p) theory along with transition state theory to predict reaction rate constants for H-abstraction by H \u02d9 and C \u02d9 H3 and the subsequent unimolecular reactions. We further prove that the DLPNO approximation to CCSD(T) leads to a deviation of less than 0.25\u00a0k/mol in barrier heights for the presently studied open-shell electronic structures and use it for the prediction of reaction rate constants for H-abstraction by C \u02d9 2 H5 radicals. We find that H-abstraction by ethyl radicals might denote a significant pathway, which should not be neglected in kinetic modeling studies of DEM. It is also shown that reaction pathways leading to ethylene formation are of minor importance and give thereby a first insight into the fate of the C\u2212C bonds. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first high-level ab-initio study of DEM, which makes the reaction kinetics and thermochemistry data provided by this study vital for future comprehensive kinetic modeling of DEM.",

One of the main challenges is on how to account for the large scarcity of accurate data. The ever-growing computational power and availability of high performance computing solutions allows to envisage implementing on-the-fly ab initio calculations for a large number of reaction rate coefficients. Today extensive user knowledge and involvement is required to develop fast and effective ab initio based kinetic models. The present work introduces a series of automation procedures to minimize user involvement. It allows automated quantum chemical calculations for a large number of reactions for gas-phase processes with a wide variety in chemical species. 3D coordinates are calculated for all the reactants, products and transition states and automatically submitted to quantum chemistry packages. The latter yield accurate high-pressure limit rate coefficients. All steps are automated without the need for manual interventions, even for recognizing rotational frequencies and for verifying whether the saddle point searches lead to the appropriate transition state. A good agreement to literature data is found, i.e., most of the rate coefficients are within a factor of 2 of literature data.",

     "abstract": "The reaction of O2 with butyl radicals is a key early step in the oxidation of n-butane, which is a prototypical alkane fuel with combustion properties that mimic those of many larger alkanes. Current combustion mechanisms employ kinetic descriptions for such radical oxidations that are based on fairly limited information. The present work employs a combination of experiment and theory to probe the kinetics of O2 reacting with both 1- and 2-butyl radicals. The experiments employ laser photolysis to generate butyl radicals and thereby initiate the reaction kinetics. Photoionization mass spectrometric observations of the time-dependent butyl radical concentration yield rate coefficients for the overall reaction. The experiments cover temperatures ranging from 200 to 500\u202fK and He bath gas pressures ranging from 0.3 to 6\u202fTorr. Ab initio transition state theory (TST) based master equation calculations are used to predict the kinetics over a broad range of conditions. The calculations consider both the barrierless R\u202f+\u202fO2 entrance channel, treated with direct CASPT2 variable reaction coordinate TST, and the decomposition of the RO2 complex to HO2\u202f+\u202falkenes, treated with CCSD(T)/CBS based TST. Theory and experiment are in good agreement, with maximum discrepancies of about 30%, suggesting the appropriateness of the theory based predictions for conditions of greater relevance to combustion. The kinetic description arising from this work should be of considerable utility to combustion modeling of n-butane, as well as of other related saturated hydrocarbons.",

At low temperatures (223\u2013304\u00a0K), the reaction proceeds overwhelmingly by a simple addition reaction to the \u2212 CH 2 end of the radical, and the measured CH 3 CCCH 2 \u2022 + O 2 reaction rate coefficient shows negative temperature dependence and depends on bath gas density. At intermediate temperatures (340\u2013395\u00a0K), the addition reaction equilibrates and the equilibrium constant was determined at different temperatures. At high temperatures (465\u2013681\u00a0K), the kinetics is governed by O2 addition to the third carbon atom of the radical, and rate coefficient measurements were again possible. The high temperature CH 3 CCCH 2 \u2022 + O 2 rate coefficient is much smaller than at low T, shows positive temperature dependence, and is independent of bath gas density. In the intermediate and high temperature ranges, we observe a formation signal for ketene (ethenone). The reaction was further investigated by combining the experimental results with quantum chemical calculations and master equation modeling. By making small adjustments ( 2 \u2212 3 kJ mol \u2212 1 ) to the energies of two key transition states, the model reproduces the experimental results within uncertainties.

These reactions give a shortcut during the important fuel consumption phase in combustion processes leading from H-atom abstraction directly to the \u03b2-scission products without fuel radical thermalization. Methyl formate (MF) was shown to be prone to hot \u03b2-scission due to a low \u03b2-scission barrier height. Furthermore, MF as smallest methyl ester can be considered as biodiesel surrogate and it is an important intermediate product during combustion of various ethers. In this work a predominantly ab-initio derived detailed kinetic model of MF combustion is developed including hot \u03b2-scission pathways and compared to a sophisticated literature model based on classical estimation methods. For this, new stoichiometric MF in air ignition delay time measurements in a shock tube and a rapid compression machine over a wide temperature range (790\u00a0K\u20131250\u00a0K) and pressures of 10, 20 and 40\u00a0bar served as validation targets. The experimental ignition delay times (IDT) show Arrhenius type behavior in both facilities at all conditions. The newly developed quantum-based model catches the pressure dependency and low-temperature reactivity well although overpredicting the IDT at higher temperatures. It was found that hot \u03b2-scission is the major depletion pathway of formate group-centered MF radicals. This, however, does not change the overall reactivity of MF combustion due to the low stability of the alkyl peroxide (RO2) at the formate group. For species with competing thermal \u03b2-scission and RO2 formation, however, hot \u03b2-scission may have a significant impact.",

The exact quantum mechanical method benchmarks the other three approximate methods that are based on classical Monte Carlo phase space integrals, on vibrational perturbation theory, and on conventional harmonic partition functions evaluated with fundamental, rather than harmonic, frequencies. The last two of these methods converge on the exact partition function below temperatures that vary from 1500\u202fK for the least anharmonic system (H2O) to 250\u202fK for the most anharmonic system (H2O2).

This paper presents a theoretical and computational framework that identifies and estimates rate constants for potential chemically termolecular reactions, for which information has been previously limited, based on information already available for known reactions in combustion mechanisms. Applications of this approach to flames, presented herein, reveal a few chemically termolecular reactions that impact flame emissions and flame speeds \u2013 including H\u00a0+\u00a0N2\u00a0+\u00a0O = NH\u00a0+\u00a0NO, H\u00a0+\u00a0CO\u00a0+\u00a0H = H2\u00a0+\u00a0CO, and H\u00a0+\u00a0C2H2\u00a0+\u00a0O2/OH/H. These reactions, therefore, are worthwhile candidates for detailed master equation calculations for improved quantitative predictions.",

     "abstract": "Many of the reactions important to combustion proceed through rovibrationally excited complexes, whose evolution depends on energy-transferring collisions with molecules in the surrounding mixture\u2014yielding a strong dependence of rate constants on pressure and collisional energy transfer characteristics of the mixture. In nearly all realistic combustion environments, a substantial fraction of multiple species of distinct collisional energy transfer characteristics are present\u2014thus requiring a \u201cmixture rule\u201d to interpolate kinetic data from individual single-component bath gases. While mixture effects for reactions proceeding through a single potential well to a single channel have been extensively investigated, mixture effects and mixture rules for multi-well and/or multi-channel reactions are significantly less characterized. The present study presents an investigation of the mixture effects, suitability of mixture rules for representing them, and their impacts on combustion predictions for the allyl + HO2 reaction system. The performance of different mixture rules for representing multi-component pressure dependence of rate constants for allyl + HO2 was evaluated through comparisons against master equation calculations for the mixture. The comparisons revealed that the classic linear mixture rule (LMR,P) yields deviations reaching a factor of two for typical combustion mixtures, whereas newly proposed mixture rules based on reduced pressure exhibit lower deviations of generally less \u202f\u223c\u202f3%. Simulations of shock tube ignition delay times and jet-stirred reactor species profiles for C3H6 combustion suggest that mixture effects for allyl + HO2 on combustion predictions can be significant and may serve as a plausible explanation of the rate parameter adjustments employed in modeling studies to reproduce combustion measurements. Newly proposed mixture rules based on the reduced pressure are shown to accurately capture these mixture effects within combustion simulations.",

     "abstract": "Large-scale implementation of high level computational theoretical chemical kinetics offers the prospect for dramatically improving the fidelity of combustion chemical modeling. As a first step toward this goal, we developed a procedure for automatically generating the thermochemical data for combustion of an arbitrary fuel. The procedure begins by producing a list of combustion relevant species from a specification of the fuel and combustion conditions of interest. Then, for each element in the list of species, the procedure determines an internal coordinate z-matrix description of its structure, the optimal torsional configuration via Monte Carlo sampling, key rovibrational properties for that optimal geometry (including anharmonic corrections from torsional mappings and/or vibrational perturbation theory), and high level estimates of the electronic and zero-point energies via arbitrarily defined composite methods. This dataset is then converted first to partition functions, then to thermodynamic properties, and finally to NASA polynomial representations of the data. The end product is an automatically generated database of electronic structure results and thermochemical data including representations in a format appropriate for combustion simulations. The utility and functioning of this predictive automated computational thermochemistry (PACT) software package is illustrated through application to the automated generation of thermochemical data for the combustion of n-butane. Butane is chosen for this demonstration as its species list is of reasonably manageable size for debugging level computations, while still presenting most of the key challenges that need to be surmounted in the consideration of larger fuels. Furthermore, its low temperature chemistry is representative of that occurring with larger alkanes.",

Consistently with previous detailed measurements on n-hexanal oxidation, experiments have been carried out for both fuels over the temperature range 475\u20131100\u202fK, at a residence time of 2\u202fs, pressure of 106.7\u202fkPa, inlet fuel mole fraction of 0.005 and at three equivalence ratios (\u03d5\u202f=\u202f0. 5, 1 and 2).

Based on the experimental observations and new calculations of the rate constants for the H-abstractions from the methyl groups of T124MCH by H/OH, a new kinetic model involving 530 species and 3160 reactions was developed with a reasonable agreement with the measured species profiles. With \u03c6 increasing, T124MCH consumption shifts to higher temperatures, and the reaction zone becomes broader by 50\u202fK. Rate-of-production analysis reveals that T124MCH consumption is generally governed by CH bond cleavage to form nine cyclic C9H17 radicals, which mostly isomerize to linear C9H17 radicals and then decompose by \u03b2-scission.

This work presents findings of previously unreported three-stage heat release in the auto-ignition of n-heptane/air mixtures at lean equivalence ratios and high pressures. Detailed homogenous gas-phase chemical kinetic simulations were utilized to identify conditions where two-stage and three-stage heat release exist. Temperature and heat release profiles of lean n-heptane/air auto-ignition display three distinct stages of heat release, which is notably different than two-stage heat release typically reported for stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures. Concentration profiles of key radicals (HO2 and OH) and intermediate/product species (CO and CO2) also display unique behavior in the lean auto-ignition case. Rapid compression machine measurements were performed at a lean equivalence ratio to confirm the existence of three-stage heat release in experiments. Laser diagnostic measurements of CO concentrations in the RCM indicate similar concentration-time profiles as those predicted by kinetic modeling. Computational singular perturbation was then used to identify key reactions and species contributing to explosive time scales at various points of the three-stage ignition process. Comparisons with two-stage ignition at stoichiometric conditions indicate that thermal runaway at the second stage of heat release is inhibited under lean conditions. H\u202f+\u202fO2 chain branching and CO oxidation reactions drive high-temperature heat release under stoichiometric conditions, but these reactions are suppressed by H, OH, and HO2 radical termination reactions at lean conditions, leading to a distinct third stage of heat release.",

Such transition is much less sensitive compared to the H2/CO/O2 system, and is explained by the different responses of the kinetic parameters corresponding to O and OH radical competitions by H2 and CH4. It is further shown that the explosion limits at various conditions can be reproduced well with a reduced mechanism of 22 elementary steps and 17 species. Further eigenvalue analysis with quasi-steady state simplification leads to accurate analytic solutions for the explosion limits, with explicit expressions for the controlling pathways for different H2 and CH4 concentrations.

     "abstract": "The study investigates the impacts of n-butanol addition to a reference gasoline (RON 95, MON 86.6) and a gasoline surrogate on ignition delay times at various blending ratios (10%, 20%, 40% and 85%\u202fvol n-butanol) in a rapid compression machine, through experimental measurements and numerical modelling (T\u202f=\u202f678\u2013916\u202fK, P\u202f=\u202f2\u202fMPa, stoichiometric conditions). The surrogate measurements are used to evaluate a recent chemical mechanism describing the combustion of the blends. The toluene reference fuel (TRF) surrogate showed adequate performance in replicating the ignition response of gasoline for all conditions tested, with closest agreement for the 85% blends. Some discrepancies existed within the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region, suggesting that better matching of both MON and RON or additional surrogate components may be required. At low temperatures, increasing n-butanol concentration led to increases in ignition delay times. Here, n-butanol acted as an octane enhancer even at low concentrations, with marginal additional effects for blends above 40%. A brute force sensitivity analysis of the surrogate model suggested that the main reaction inhibiting ignition at low temperatures is H abstraction from the \u03b1-site of n-butanol, even for the 10% blend. At higher temperatures, the chain branching routes from H abstraction by OH from the \u03b3-site of n-butanol, and from the \u03b1-site by HO2, become more dominant, promoting ignition. For the lower blends, the largest discrepancies between simulations and experiment were seen in the NTC region where a larger number of reactions contributed to the uncertainty in predicting \u03c4ign. For the higher blends, the largest discrepancies were noted at low temperatures, indicating that uncertainties within the low temperature n-butanol chemistry need to be resolved. Accurate, temperature and pressure dependent reaction rates for site specific H abstraction by OH and HO2 for each of the fuel blend components are necessary to improve agreement between simulations and experimental data.",

     "abstract": "Diethyl ether (DEE) has been recently suggested as a potential biofuel for compression-ignition engines that are known to be significantly controlled by low-temperature (LT) chemistry. However, the LT oxidation of DEE has not fully been understood in term of the formation of LT fuel-specific products. We have thus studied the oxidation of DEE by examining detailed profiles of its oxidation products under LT conditions (400\u20131100\u202fK). To this end, we have used a dedicated experimental setup including a nearly-atmospheric jet-stirred reactor (JSR) coupled to online gas chromatography (GC). The experiments were complemented by measurements made with a JSR coupled to tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet (SVUV) photoionization (PI) molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) for a cross-validation of the identification of important LT species.Experimental results indicate that DEE is very reactive; it starts to react around 425\u202fK. DEE exhibits an unusual oxidation behavior with two negative temperature coefficient (NTC) zones in the JSR study. Because of this two-NTC observation, additional experiments were performed with a plug flow reactor (PFR) combined with electron ionization (EI)-MBMS, confirming this behavior in the two types of reactor. Moreover, about 20 oxidation species in C1C4 range were detected with several intermediates containing 2-3 O-atoms. Acetic acid is found to peak at 525\u202fK with a very large amount, suggesting that it is a key species in the early stage of DEE's LT oxidation. Possible DEE-consumption paths leading to acetic acid formation could play an important role in the oxidation mechanism of DEE. A new model is proposed based on the present experimental observations to include new primary LT reaction paths. The model reproduces the experimental phenomena quite well and enhances the understanding of the two-NTC-zone occurrence and of intermediates containing 2-3 O-atoms during the LT oxidation of DEE.",

The kinetic mechanism was built hierarchically using similar set of reaction pathways and reaction rate rules. In the mechanism developed, special emphasis is put on describing the detailed low-temperature ignition chemistry of o-xylene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to do so in a detailed kinetic mechanism. In addition to kinetic modeling, new experimental data were acquired for toluene, o-xylene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene using a rapid compression machine at low-to-intermediate temperatures and engine relevant pressures. In addition, the mechanism has been compared against data sets from the literature covering ignition delay times, flame speeds, and speciation profiles measured in a jet-stirred reactor and flow reactor. Good agreement is observed between the mechanism predictions and the experimental data. Kinetic analysis demonstrated the importance of including the low temperature chemistry of the benzylperoxy radicals to accurately capture the ignition propensity of o-xylene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene at low-to-intermediate temperatures and high pressures.

However, the relationship between the fuel structure and thermal decomposition intermediate products, which determine the global combustion behaviors, is not as well known. In this study, four octane isomers, n-octane, 2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (iso-octane), and 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane, are selected as the model compounds to illustrate the distinct product generation in the oxidative pyrolysis of large hydrocarbons with substantially different molecular structures. Both experimental and kinetic analysis show that all the octane isomers lead to the formation of a similar group of stable products, with the major ones being ethene, methane, propene, and isobutene. The distributions of these products vary from fuel to fuel; n-octane produces primarily ethene, while isobutene formation increases with increasing branching in the fuel molecular structure. The most branched isomer, 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane, produces predominately isobutene. Lumped, two-step reaction schemes are proposed for each octane isomer. Together with a detailed foundational fuel chemistry model, it is shown that the reaction models accurately predict the formation and subsequent consumption of the intermediate products for all octane isomers studied.",

Rate constants for the unimolecular decomposition of acetic acid were determined integrating the 1D master equation over a Potential Energy Surface (PES) investigated at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ level. Energies were computed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level using a basis set size correction factor determined at the DF-MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ level. Three decomposition channels were considered: CO2\u00a0+\u00a0CH4, CH2CO\u202f+\u202fH2O, and CH3\u00a0+\u00a0COOH. Rate constants were computed in the 700\u20132100\u00a0K and 0.1\u2013100\u00a0atm temperature and pressure ranges. The simulations show that the reaction is in fall off above 1200\u00a0K at pressures smaller than 10\u00a0atm. Successively, the PESs for acetic acid H-abstraction by H, OH, OOH, O2, and CH3 were investigated at the same level of theory. Rate constants were computed accounting explicitly for the formation of entrance and exit van der Waals wells and their collisional stabilization. Energy barriers were determined at the CASPT2 level for H-abstraction by OH of the acidic H, since it has a strong multireference character. The calculated rate constant is in good agreement with experiments and supports the experimental finding that at low temperatures it is pressure dependent. The calculated rate constants were used to update the POLIMI kinetic model and to simulate the pyrolysis and combustion of acetic acid. It was found that acetic acid decomposition and the formation of its direct decomposition products can be reasonably predicted. The formation of secondary products, such as H2 and C2 hydrocarbons, is underpredicted. This suggests that reaction routes not incorporated in the model may be active.

Two hydrocarbon fuels, isooctane and 3-hexene, were investigated in order to assess the hypothesis of an inhibiting effect of iron oxide particles on HO2 radicals and H2O2. Ignition delays were measured at core gas temperatures of 700\u202fK and 850\u202fK, pressures from 6 to 20\u202fbar, and ferrocene mole fractions in the original fuel from 0 to 900\u202fppm. These experiments provide insight into the kinetics of the antiknock effect of ferrocene on both the non-octane sensitive (isooctane) and octane sensitive (3-hexene) fuels.Experimental results show that doping reactive mixtures with ferrocene always lengthens the total ignition delay. Also, the increment in auto-ignition delay is monotonic with increasing amount of ferrocene while no loss of effectiveness was noticed, even at the highest mole fractions. On the other hand, in the event of two stage ignition, the first stage delay is not affected by any doping with ferrocene. The kinetic mode of action of ferrocene is investigated, based on these statements, in an effort to better understand the impact of organometallic octane boosters on the combustion of fuels.A kinetic short sub-mechanism was built in order to describe the influence of ferrocene on the reactivity of isooctane and 3-hexene in a RCM, yielding qualitative agreement.",

Experiments were conducted for 1,2-DME/O2/N2 mixtures with different equivalence ratios (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0) in a high-pressure (10\u00a0atm) jet-stirred reactor (JSR) facility over the temperature range of 450\u20131100\u00a0K. Species concentration evolutions with the temperature were monitored with on-line Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and off-line gas chromatography (GC). The technique of photoionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (PI-MBMS) was combined with another JSR setup operated at near-atmospheric pressure (700\u00a0Torr), for the purpose of probing reactive intermediates from 1,2-DME oxidation. A kinetic model was constructed based on the \u201creaction classes\u201d strategy, which could satisfactorily predict speciation measurements in the current work. Pronounced low-temperature reactivity of 1,2-DME was observed under all investigated conditions, and crucial intermediates like ketohydroperoxides were detected with the PI-MBMS. Some specificities of 1,2-DME oxidation were elucidated through further model interpretations. The double ether groups imbedded in the fuel molecule make hydrogen abstractions easier and meanwhile hinder the chain-terminating concerted eliminations, so the low-temperature reactivity starts at relatively low temperatures (compared to n-hexane for example). Chain-branching reaction sequences following the second O2 additions proceed in the oxidizing mixtures, leading to the remarkable low-temperature reactivity of 1,2-DME which can be utilized as a cetane-improver.",

Automatic mechanism generation provides a powerful platform for comprehensively exploring reaction sequences implied by known chemistry and identifying the ones that are important in various systems. Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), a software developed on our group, has been successfully used to model a variety of chemistries, but has previously been unprepared to properly handle the challenge of aromatics. To accurately model PAH chemistry, several improvements were needed to core RMG algorithms: more robust resonance structure generation for PAHs and more flexible reaction generation algorithms for aromatics. Resonance structures are an integral part of the reaction generation algorithm, so representation accuracy is an important consideration. Clar structures were introduced as a concise and accurate representation for PAHs to replace Kekul\u00e9 structures. This combined with a refactoring of the overall resonance algorithm also provided significant performance gains. Another major improvement was enabling reactivity of benzene bonds, which allows much greater flexibility in designing rate rules to differentiate aromatic and aliphatic reactions. As a test case, a model was generated for co-pyrolysis of iodonaphthalene and acetylene and compared with literature data, demonstrating the much-improved ability of RMG in modeling aromatic species.",

     "abstract": "The oxidation of acetylene is central to the oxidation of virtually all hydrocarbon fuels. It is also important for commercial industry, due to its wide range of applications such as flame photometry, atomic absorption, welding etc. In this study, ignition delay times (IDTs) for acetylene oxidation were measured at elevated pressures (10\u201330\u202fbar) and temperatures (700\u20131300\u202fK) in a high-pressure shock tube (HPST) and in a rapid compression machine (RCM). The range of pressures, temperatures and mixture compositions studied are at conditions never previously investigated in the literature. The new measurements highlight some major shortcomings in our understanding of the oxidation mechanism of acetylene. The importance of these findings is accentuated, considering the fundamental nature of acetylene chemistry in modelling larger hydrocarbons. These data are complemented by new laminar burning velocity (LBV) experiments, independently performed in two different laboratories. As commercial cylinders commonly contain acetylene gas dissolved in acetone, we have also tested the influence of acetone on acetylene reactivity. It was found that the measured LBVs in both laboratories decreased when acetylene dissolved in acetone was used versus when the pure acetylene was used. The IDTs displayed no such sensitivity. When compared to the literature data, the new LBVs for pure acetylene displayed a pronounced increase in the fuel-rich regime, and the peak flame speeds from TAMU and RWTH increased by about 21 and 14\u202fcm/s, respectively. The kinetic models, with one exception, over-predict the measured IDTs by an order of magnitude at temperatures below \u223c1000\u202fK. The reaction of acetylene with hydroperoxyl radicals is critical in accurately predicting the low-temperature, high-pressure IDT data.

In the HRRST, the temperature and pressure change during the test time, complicating interpretation of ignition delay times. Two methods of chemical kinetic modeling were employed in order to account for the changing thermodynamic states. One was based on direct simulation using the pressure profile and the kinetic mechanism, and the other was based on a Livengood-Wu type approach using modeled constant state ignition delay times. Two different kinetic mechanisms were used in simulating the data. Both methods showed agreement with experimental data over a range of temperatures, pressures, and blends. While overall agreement was fair, agreement was poorer for one of the mechanisms for the primary reference fuel blends. An evaluation of the ignition delay iso-contours from these mechanisms for representative HRRST experiment thermodynamic trajectories revealed that the HRRST measured IDTs are controlled by the high temperature chemistry and are more sensitive to temperature. The different performance of mechanisms is therefore attributed to their different high temperature reactivity.",

     "abstract": "For long-term storage, part of the excess renewable energy can be stored into various fuels, among which ammonia and hydrogen show a high potential. To improve the power-to-fuel-to-power overall efficiency and reduce NOx emissions, the intrinsic properties of Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) engines could be used to convert these carbon-free fuels back into electricity and heat. Yet, ignition delay times for ammonia are not available at relevant LTC conditions. This lack of fundamental kinetic knowledge leads to uncertain ignition delay predictions by the existing ammonia kinetic mechanisms and prevents from determining optimal LTC running conditions. Using a Rapid Compression Machine (RCM), we have studied the ignition delay of ammonia with hydrogen addition (0%, 10%, and 25%vol.) under LTC conditions: low equivalence ratios (0.2, 0.35, 0.5), high pressures (43 and 65 bar) and low temperatures (1000\u20131100\u00a0K). This paper presents the comparison of the experimental data with simulation results obtained with five kinetic mechanisms found in the literature. It then provides a sensitivity analysis to highlight the most influencing reactions on the ignition of the ammonia-hydrogen blends. The obtained range of ignition delays for pure ammonia and for the ammonia-hydrogen blends prove their suitability for LTC engines. Still the hydrogen addition must be greater than 10%vol.\u00a0to produce a significant promotion of the ignition delay. The two best performing mechanisms still predict too long ignition delays for pure ammonia, while the delays become too short for ammonia-hydrogen blends. A third mechanism captures correctly the relative influence of hydrogen addition, but is globally over-reactive. Through a sensitivity analysis, H2NO has been identified as the main cause for the under-reactive pure ammonia kinetics and N2Hx has been identified as the main cause for globally over-reactive ammonia-hydrogen mechanisms.",

In particular, data are reported for two exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) loadings of 0 and 25% to demonstrate the impact of EGR on gasoline ignition delay times.

A published gasoline mechanism (Cai and Pitsch, 2015) is modified as part of this study following the latest kinetic knowledge and is further used to compute the ignition delay times at the conditions experimentally investigated. The simulations employ a four-component surrogate consisting of n-heptane, iso-octane, toluene, and ethanol. It is shown that the proposed model predicts the total ignition delay times of gasoline accurately under various conditions and reflects correctly the influences of pressure, EGR, and equivalence ratio on ignition delay times, while it fails to predict the first stage ignition delay times with very high accuracy due to the neglect of the olefin and naphthene content in the surrogate formulation.

PRFs show approximately linear blending in terms of CO formation in the LTO, NTC, and ITO regimes, which is consistent with the definition of the octane number scale. In contrast, adding ethanol into iso-octane disproportionally inhibits the CO formation over the same temperature range, with 20\u00a0vol% of ethanol completely suppressing the reactivity of iso-octane. Such behavior is also consistent with the synergistic octane blending of the two compounds recently reported [Foong et al. Fuel 115 (2014) 727\u2013739]. These results suggest a potential connection between the oxidation reactivity of these fuels and their octane blending behaviors. Kinetic modeling is conducted using the latest combustion mechanisms for neat compounds and gasoline surrogate. Good agreement in CO formation is observed between the model and experiment for both neat fuels and their mixtures.",

Four different diagnostics have been used: gas chromatography (GC), chemiluminescence NOx analyzer, continuous wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy (cw-CRDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In the case of the oxidation of neat methane, the onset temperature for CH4 oxidation was above 1025\u202fK, while it is shifted to 825\u202fK with the addition of NO2 or NO, independently of equivalence ratio, indicating that the addition of NO2 or NO highly promotes CH4 oxidation. The consumption rate of CH4 exhibits a similar trend with the presence of both NO2 and NO. The amount of produced HCN has been quantified and a search for HONO and CH3NO2 species has been attempted. A detailed kinetic mechanism, derived from POLIMI kinetic framework, has been used to interpret the experimental data with a good agreement between experimental data and model predictions. Reaction rate and sensitivity analysis have been conducted to illustrate the kinetic regimes. The fact that the addition of NO or NO2 seems to have similar effects on promoting CH4 oxidation can be explained by the fact that both species are involved in a reaction cycle interchanging them and whose result is 2CH3+\u202fO2=\u202f2CH2O\u202f+\u202f2H. Additionally, the direct participation of NO2 in the NO2+\u202fCH2O\u202f=\u202fHONO\u202f+\u202fHCO reaction has a notable accelerating effect on methane oxidation.",

This contribution reports the promotion effects of carbon disulfide (CS2) on oxidation of methane (CH4), with experiments conducted in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR), and explains the experimental findings from comprehensive kinetic modelling of CH4/CS2/O2 systems. This includes neat oxidation of CH4/O2 and CS2/O2 under stoichiometric conditions, as compared with co-oxidation of CH4/CS2/O2, containing different measures of CS2. Addition of small amounts of CS2 (50\u202fppm and 100\u202fppm) enhances the oxidation of CH4 (500\u202fppm) as characterised by a lower onset temperature (1300\u202fK versus 1200\u202fK and 1060\u202fK). In contrast, the presence of CH4 delays the process of CS2 oxidation. Considering the similarity in the core charge of O and S, we propose the reactivity of S2, SO and in particular S towards CH4 to be responsible for the observed behaviours, in addition to an important effect of O radicals generated in oxidation of CS2 on engendering the oxidation of CH4. As reported in the literature, in analogy to O2 and O which oxidise CH4 into CO2, the S/S2/SO could also \u2018sulfurdise\u2019 CH4 into CS2 or COS under oxygen-lean conditions. Quantum chemistry calculations of the CH4\u202f+\u202fO, CH4\u202f+\u202fS, CH4\u202f+\u202fS2, CH4\u202f+\u202fSO and CH4\u202f+\u202fO2 reactions further reveal the reactivity of O, O2, S, S2 and SO towards H abstraction from CH4. The sensitivity analysis of the kinetic modelling of the proposed co-oxidation reactions indicates that, the radicals formed during the CS2 conversion process promote the oxidation of CH4 at lower temperatures. However, the consumption of radicals in the CH4 oxidation also inhibits the decomposition of CS2 as observed in the experiments.",

First, the possibility of different product branching fractions is considered; temperature- and pressure-dependent rate constants are computed for H and CH3 addition to the N=O bond in both HONO and HNO2. These results suggest that addition of a radical to HONO and HNO2 do indeed have different products, but that the results are not likely to have a significant effect. Next, two different approaches to simplifying the HONO submechanism are considered. In the first, HNO2 is removed from the mechanism. In the second, HNO2 is replaced with HONO. These two strategies are implemented in different literature mechanisms and then used to compute ignition delay times for H2 and CH4. The results show that removing HNO2 has a modest effect on the ignition delay time, whereas systematically replacing HNO2 with HONO decreases the predicted ignition delay by approximately a factor of two. The recommendation is that for larger fuels, both HONO and HNO2 should be included in the mechanism.",

The nitrites act as clean, thermal sources of alkyl radicals that create the radicals at much lower temperatures than are accessible with other precursors.

     "abstract": "Increasingly stringent regulations are imposed on nitric oxide (NO) due to its numerous, direct and indirect, deleterious effects on human health and the environment. A better control of the post-flame temperature field to contain the thermal (Zel\u2019dovich) route resulted in significant reductions of engine emissions. An improved knowledge of the chemistry and rate of the secondary prompt, NNH, and N2O pathways is now required to decrease nitric oxide emissions further. For this effort, NO laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements are presented for lean ( \u03d5 = 0.7 ), jet-wall, stagnation, premixed flames at pressures of 2, 4, and 8 atm. For all cases, the NO-LIF signal increases rapidly through the flame front, and relatively slowly in the post-flame region where the temperature is too low to sustain the thermal pathway. Nitric oxide mole fractions are inferred from the measurements and show that the pressure has a very weak, monotonic, adverse effect on NO formation. Reaction pathway analyses are applied to flame simulations performed with a thermochemical model capturing the general trends of the data to assess the contribution of each NO formation route. For all cases, the N2O pathway, which proceeds mostly in the flame front region, dominates. This route produces slightly larger amounts of NO at higher pressures, but the variation appears very limited when considering the termolecular nature of its initiation reaction. The thermal route is predicted to progress slowly in the post-flame region, which causes a shallow increase in the NO mole fraction. The NNH and prompt pathways generate small amounts of NO, and their contributions reduce with the pressure. Overall, the thermochemical model predicts that the formation of NO is relatively unaffected by the pressure, which is consistent with the experiments. The experimental dataset reported in this work is made available for the development of thermochemical models.",

The sensitization effect of NO2 on C2H4 ignition was investigated at pressures ranging from 1.2 to 10 atm, in the temperature range 920\u20131780\u202fK, and at equivalence ratios from 0.5 to 2.0. Similar to our recent studies of NO2 effects on CH4 and C2H6 ignition (Deng et\u00a0al., 2016; Deng et\u00a0al., 2017), the effect of NO2 addition on measured IDTs of the unsaturated hydrocarbon C2H4 also exhibits both temperature- and pressure- dependences. NO2 addition generally promotes the reactivity of ethylene and the promotion effect is more pronounced for the mixtures with high NO2 content at higher pressures (p\u202f>\u202f4.0 atm), at lower temperatures (T\u202f<\u202f1200\u202fK) and for fuel-rich mixtures.

Then, based on the results, a reduced mechanism for n-heptane oxidation is developed.

The results indicate that the predictions from the present reduced mechanism and the reduced mechanism with 305 species satisfactorily agree that of the detailed mechanism. Furthermore, the discrepancy of the predictions among these mechanisms is discussed based on the Spearman Rank Correlation analysis. It is found that, for the reduced mechanism with 120 species, the optimization of the reaction rate constants significantly improves the nominal model prediction of the ignition delay time, whereas its influence on the range and profile of the frequency distribution is rather weak due to the intrinsic relationship among the reactions being broken in the reduced mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Thermochemical properties play an important role for accurate predictions of ignition characteristics using chemical kinetic models due to their impact on energy balances and chemical equilibrium. Therefore, the acquisition and incorporation of accurate thermochemical data have been a major objective of many recent modeling studies. As an addition to these studies, the present work investigates the impact of species thermochemical data and of their uncertainties on the prediction of fuel combustion. Sensitivity analysis is used first to evaluate the effects of enthalpies of formation, standard entropies, and heat capacities of single species on ignition characteristics employing a recent diethyl ether model (Sakai et\u00a0al., 2017). Modified strategies for uncertainty quantification, which have been traditionally used to quantify prediction uncertainties due to rate parameter uncertainties, are then applied to quantify the joint impact of uncertainties in the thermochemical data on the ignition delay times. Large prediction uncertainties are found in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime, where different reaction channels compete with each other and thus, small shifts of chemical equilibria of reactions can strongly affect the reaction pathway. Moreover, automatic calibration of enthalpies of formation within their uncertainty limits is performed for a 2-methylhexane model (Mohamed et\u00a0al., 2016) in order to demonstrate the potential for model improvement in terms of the thermochemical parameters. This optimization process significantly improves ignition delay time predictions at the conditions of interest. Overall, the results show that the predicted uncertainties, and thus the potential for optimization, are high at conditions where multiple reaction channels are competing each other, while they are relatively lower when the reaction pathway is unique.",

The procedure is formalized in a Bayesian statistical framework, employing maximum-entropy and approximate Bayesian computation methods and utilizing efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to explore data and parameter spaces in a nested algorithm. We demonstrate the application of the method in the context of experiments designed to measure the rates of selected chain reactions in the H2-O2 system and highlight the utility of this approach for revealing the critical correlations between the parameters within a single reaction and across reactions, as well as for maximizing consistency when utilizing rate parameter information in predictive combustion modeling of systems of interest.",

     "abstract": "Sensitivity analysis of the ignition delay time and species profiles to kinetic parameters has been widely used to identify the rate-limiting steps during the autoignition process, providing insights for the optimization of the reaction mechanism. This work studies the time evolution of the sensitivity directions of the temperature and species concentration during autoignition. The direction is represented by a unit vector along the gradient of the simulation output to the kinetic parameters, and the alignment between the two directions are measured by the inner product between the corresponding unit vectors. We use evolution of the sensitivity directions to reveal changes in the rate-limiting steps and the correlation among species at different phases of the ignition delay period. It is found that the sensitivity directions of temperature and the concentrations of the major intermediate species are similar to each other during the entire ignition delay period. In particular, they converge to the same direction when approaching the ignition state, and the direction is the same as the one for the ignition delay time. The correlation is validated for various fuels across a wide range of pressures and temperatures, and works for both single-stage ignition and two-stage ignition. Consequently the sensitivity of the ignition delay time can be efficiently evaluated based on the temperature sensitivity at the ignition point, for which a single run of the simulation can produce the sensitivity to all parameters, as otherwise the sensitivity of the ignition delay time has to be evaluated through finite difference, in which the number of runs equals to the number of parameters. It can also significantly reduce the computation cost of gradient-based algorithms for the purpose of mechanism optimization and uncertainty quantification.",

     "abstract": "The radiative characteristics of buoyant ethylene diffusion flames were investigated in normal air (21% O2 by volume) and nitrogen-diluted, reduced-oxygen conditions (15\u201319% O2 concentrations). The characteristics for a 15\u00a0kW heat release rate flame, such as the radiant-power distribution and the line-of-sight spectral emission, were measured. A reduction of the overall radiant fraction in reduced-oxygen conditions was observed compared to flames burning in normal air. This reduction could generally be attributed to lower soot emission. To better understand this effect, simultaneous measurements of local soot volume fraction and temperature were conducted using the two-color pyrometry technique. The soot volume fraction and the temperature statistics on the flame axis are reported for both 21% O2 and 17% O2 co-flow conditions. The soot volume fractions for 21% O2 are generally found to be higher than those at the 17% O2 condition. But the soot temperature is relatively similar, showing the soot formation reactions occur at the similar temperature range, and the lower temperature environment of 17 % O2 attributes to smaller soot concentration. As a result, these factors cause a lower local soot emission intensity. A negative correlation between the fluctuating components of soot volume fraction and temperature is found to occur, with the correlation weakening at higher elevations. Overall, the measurements provide new understanding into spatiotemporal soot-radiation characteristics of buoyant, turbulent flames burning in different co-flow oxygen conditions.",

Primarily non-premixed propane flames were investigated in oxy-fuel mode with various concentrations of oxygen in the oxidant. The turbulent flame character was manifested through two-dimensional single-shot LII signals from soot showing strong spatial variations as well as local temporal variations. The LII signals were calibrated to soot volume fractions, fv, using in-situ extinction in the same spatial regions of the furnace. The results show increased fv for increasing oxygen concentration in the oxidant, which is related to increased temperatures as well as decreased mixing inside the furnace due to lowered total flow. For some measurement cases, the influence of additives was studied for flames in oxy-fuel and air environments. The results showed increased fv for additions of SO2 and NO for oxy-fuel conditions, while a decrease of fv was found for air-fed flames. Also, a large decrease in fv was found for water injection in the air-fed flames, and a slightly larger decrease for addition of KCl dissolved in water with the same amount of injected solution. Uncertainties in performing soot volume fraction measurements using LII and extinction in this large-scale furnace are discussed, and mainly considered to be uncertainties in E(m) for soot, the spatial variation of the laser fluence in the large imaged area, and the estimation of the absorption length during extinction calibration.",

The experiments covered pressures from 3 to 6 bar, and samples were collected at heights of 2 and 5 mm above the burner exit in nitrogen-diluted ethylene (ethylene to nitrogen mole ratio 2:1) flames with nominal visible flame heights of about 20 mm. It was observed that average primary soot particle diameter increased with increasing pressure within the pressure range considered, at both measurement locations within the flame. Fractal parameters of the soot aggregates were inferred directly from the experimental data (as opposed to the usual practice of assuming a priori values for fractal dimension and pre-factor). Near to the soot nucleation and growth regions of the co-flow laminar diffusion flames, at 2 mm above the burner exit, the fractal dimension of the aggregates was not as high as the accepted universal value of about 1.9, in spite of the fact that number of primary particles per aggregate is quite high and pressure is well above atmospheric. At 5 mm above the burner exit, however, the fractal dimension of the soot aggregates approached the accepted universal value of 1.9, at high pressures; at relatively lower pressures, the fractal dimension was about 1.6 at the same location within the flame. In view of the inferred fractal results, caution should be exercised when applying fractal analysis to low heights in flames at lower pressures where soot inception and growth are relatively dominant.",

The collected data sets were used to generate joint statistics of soot properties and flame characteristics and provided new insights into the interaction of the OH layer and soot in turbulent flames. The interaction of OH and soot as a driving mechanism for soot oxidation is of particular interest as it has been proven to be challenging to model. Statistics of soot volume fraction and primary particle size in the OH layer are employed to gain deeper insights into the soot oxidation process. Mean soot volume fraction and primary soot particle size conditioned on temperature and OH signal intensity indicate that, due to differential diffusion of soot with respect to the chemical species, high soot volume fraction and primary soot particle diameter of up to 50 nm are present at low temperatures and low OH concentration. In the soot oxidation region, statistical analysis of the soot parameters disclose that clusters of high soot volume fraction mostly consist of large primary particles. Observations from instantaneous images and the presence of large primary particles inside the OH layer suggest that the oxidation is not sufficiently fast to burn the soot completely.",

     "abstract": "We study experimentally and numerically a series of methane-fueled laminar co-flow diffusion flames to investigate the effects of variable Oxygen Index (OI) on soot yield and distribution. OI is defined as the mole fraction of oxygen in the oxidizer. Sixteen flames are studied with OI ranging from 21% (air) to 76.3%, so that OI varies in small increments and its effects are precisely resolved. The soot volume fraction distribution is measured experimentally for all flames using color-ratio pyrometry. Simulations are carried out using an extensively validated chemical kinetic mechanism and an aggregate-based soot model that accounts for all major processes of soot inception, growth, and oxidation. The experimental measurements show that the visible flame height decreases with increasing OI, which is consistent with theoretical estimates and the numerical simulations. The measurements also indicate that increasing OI (from 21% to 36.8%) first results in an increase in the maximum soot concentration, but a further increase in OI leads to a decrease in the soot yield. Additionally, the maximum soot concentration occurs on the flame centerline for low OI flames (below 36.8%), but for higher OI, the peak soot yield occurs in the flame wings. All of these experimental observations are well reproduced by the simulations, with the maximum soot volume fraction magnitudes lying within the error bounds of the experimental measurements. The computational results are used to reveal the underlying physical mechanisms, by examining soot evolution along characteristic Lagrangian trajectories through flame regions. We find that increasing OI leads to higher flame temperature, which results in a stronger soot production rate, but also reduced soot residence time in flame regions, which allows less time for soot production. These competing effects cause the initial increase and subsequent decrease in the maximum soot yield and the shift in the maximum soot yield location with increasing OI.",

The appearance of sp carbon chains composing up to 30% of the total carbon content as well as an olefinic component may indicate their important role in soot nucleation and growth in low pressure ethylene flames. Hence, Raman spectroscopy of soot particles in the aerosol phase revealed that accretion and cyclization of the aliphatic carbon including sp carbon chains could thus be of importance for the initial soot growth and require more investigation.",

The axial distributions of both Ws and SVF, within those sheets, in all flames are shown to grow with flame length up to the region where soot oxidation becomes significant, with only a secondary dependence on the inflow conditions. Probability density functions (pdfs) of Ws are seen to exhibit far less variation than those of SVF, also indicating the soot structure morphology insensitivity to inflow conditions. The effects of fuel exit strain (U/D) and bulk exit Reynolds number (ReD) on soot sheets are also assessed for three flames, of which two share the same U/D and two share the same ReD. The variation in U/D at constant ReD is seen to only affect SVF within the sheets, while a variation in ReD, at constant U/D is shown to have negligible effect on both Ws and SVF, in agreement with previous findings by the authors.

Three major components of a mallee tree, namely bark, leaf, and wood, were size-reduced to 75\u00a0\u2013\u00a0150\u00a0\u00b5m and mixed at a dry mass ratio of 15% bark:35% leaf:50% wood, which is close to the real mallee's composition, to prepare a whole-tree biomass. The three individual mallee components and the whole-tree biomass were combusted in a laboratory-scale drop-tube furnace at 1400\u00a0\u00b0C in air to produce inorganic PM10 for further quantification and characterization. The results demonstrate that, whereas the particle size distributions of the PM10 from the combustion of the bark, leaf and wood components generally follow a bimodal distribution, the yields of PM0.1, PM0.1\u20131, PM1, PM1\u201310, PM2.5, and PM10 from the three mallee components are quite different. On the bases of dry biomass and useful energy input, the yields of the PM of various size fractions studied follow a sequence of the bark\u00a0>\u00a0the leaf\u00a0>\u00a0the wood, consistent with that of the ash contents in the three components. Oppositely, the ash-based yields of PM0.1, PM0.1\u20131, PM1, PM1\u201310, PM2.5, and PM10 from the wood are substantially higher than those from the bark and the leaf. No obvious synergetic effect among different mallee components in PM10 emission is observed during the whole-tree biomass combustion, enabling the prediction of the PM10 yield from the whole-tree biomass combustion based on that from the individual mallee components.",

     "abstract": "A fully automated strategy is discussed to construct reduced chemistry suitable for the numerical simulation of stationary combustion systems of large dimension, such as auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of natural gas for syngas production. Because of computing limitations in terms of space and time resolution, three-dimensional simulations of an ATR unit cannot be addressed with detailed chemistry. A procedure is proposed to automatically derive optimised and reduced chemical schemes under specific ATR operating conditions. A stochastic model problem is first designed to probe the dynamical response of a detailed chemical scheme, over a large range of chemical compositions of the mixture. Reference composition space trajectories are built, featuring turbulent micro-mixing and reactions. Following these trajectories, the chemical response is analysed using directed relation graphs with error propagation combined with quasi-steady state hypothesis, to reduce the number of species and elementary reactions. Then, the time evolution of the model problem is coupled with a genetic algorithm, to optimise on the fly the chemical rates of the reduced kinetics, according to the reference composition space trajectories. The accuracy of the reduced scheme is monitored with a fitness function and the results are tested against the reference detailed chemistry.",

     "abstract": "Oxy-fuel combustion in pulverized coal (PC) and fluidized bed (FB) boilers is being increasingly investigated due to its potential use for carbon dioxide capture. The combustion conditions in the two types of unit differ significantly because of fuel size, furnace temperature, and fluid dynamics. These differences affect the change of combustion characteristics from air (O2/N2) to oxy-fuel (O2/CO2) conditions in PC and FB in different ways. In this paper, the oxy-fuel combustion behavior of a single sub-bituminous coal particle in PC is compared with that in FB conditions. The FB data were measured in our bench-scale FB test rig, whereas the PC data were collected from literature. The FB tests were performed at 1088\u00a0K with 0%vol < O2 <\u00a040%vol, using sub-bituminous coal with a diameter of 6\u00a0mm. An extensive list of parameters is compared, including the ignition-delay time, volatiles\u2019 flame temperature, devolatilization time, burnout time and peak temperature of the coal particle. Results indicate that the impact of shifting from air-firing to oxy-firing affects the devolatilization, burnout times, and peak temperature in PC and FB differently: PC particles require higher concentration of oxygen than coarse particles for FB to attain similar results as in air-firing. However, the impact on the volatile flame temperature of shifting to oxy-fuel flame is similar in PC and FB. In general, the CO2 atmosphere delays ignition compared to air-firing, particularly for coarse particles at low O2 concentration.",

     "abstract": "A method that is based on the initial slagging routes and the sintered/slagging route has been developed and used for predicting the ash deposition propensities of coal combustion in utility boilers supported by the data collected from power stations. Two types of initial slagging routes are considered, namely (i) pyrite-induced initial slagging on the furnace wall, and (ii) fouling caused by the alkaline/alkali components condensation in the convection section. In addition, the sintered/slagging route is considered by the liquids temperature, which represents the melting potential of the main ash composition and is calculated using the chemical equilibrium methods. The partial least square regression (PLSR) technique, coupled with a cross validation method, is employed to obtain the correlation for the ash deposition indice. The method has been successfully applied to coals/blends combustion in boilers, ranging from low rank coals to bituminous coal. The results obtained show that the developed indice yields a higher success rate in classifying the overall slagging/fouling potential in boilers than some of the typical slagging indices. In addition, only using the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio to predict the melting behaviors and slagging potential is inaccurate since the effect of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is dictated by both the original ash composition and the way in which the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is changed. Finally, the influence of the acid components (SiO2 and Al2O3) on the ash deposition prediction is investigated for guiding the mineral additives. It is noticed that the predicted ash deposition potentials of the three easy slagging coals investigated decrease more rapidly by adding Al2O3 than by adding SiO2.",

     "abstract": "For the first time, NH3\u2013air combustion power generation has been successfully realized using a 50\u00a0kW class micro gas turbine system at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan. Based on the global demand for carbon-free power generation as well as recent advances involving gas-turbine technologies, such as heat-regenerative cycles, rapid fuel mixing using strong swirling flows, and NOx reduction using selective catalytic reduction (SCR), allow us to realize NH3\u2013air combustion gas-turbine system, which was abandoned in the 1960\u2032s. In the present system, the combustor adopted gaseous NH3 fuel and diffusion combustion to enhance flame stability. The NH3 pre-cracking apparatus for combustion enhancement using generated H2 was not employed. The NH3\u2013air combustion gas-turbine power generation system can be operated over a wide range of power and rotational speeds, i.e., 18.4\u00a0kW to 44.4\u00a0kW and 70,000\u00a0rpm to 80,000\u00a0rpm, respectively. The combustion efficiency of the NH3\u2013air gas turbine ranged from 89% to 96% at 80,000\u00a0rpm. The emission of NO and unburnt NH3 depends on the combustor inlet temperature. Emission data indicates that there are NH3 fuel-rich and fuel-lean regions in the primary combustion zone. It is presumed that unburnt NH3 is released from the fuel-rich region, while NO is released from the fuel-lean region. When diluted air enters the secondary combustion zone, unburnt NH3 is expected to react with NO through selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR). NH3CH4\u2013air combustion operation tests were also performed and the results show that the increase of the NH3 fuel ratio significantly increases the NO emission, whereas it decreases the NO conversion ratio. To achieve low NOx combustion in NH3\u2013air combustion gas turbines, it is suggested to burn large quantities of NH3 fuel and produce both rich and lean fuel mixtures in the primary combustion zone.",

     "abstract": "The exhausted gas recirculation inside the combustion chamber represents a challenging strategy to stabilize the oxidation process for novel combustion processes that aim at reducing pollutants emission, controlling the system working temperature by diluting the fresh incoming charge, and keep high process efficiency. The mass and sensible enthalpy ratio of recycled exhausted gas represents a key parameter to promote and stabilize the oxidation process.The chemical/thermodynamic features of the oxidation process were investigated by means of a numerical analysis. The process was schematized as a non-adiabatic constant-volume Continuous-flow Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) where part of the exhausted gas was recirculated back to the reactor. The stability of the process was investigated as a function of the pre-heating temperature and of the dilution level of propane/oxygen/nitrogen mixtures for a fixed recirculation ratio.Following, experimental tests were realized in a small size burner characterized by a strong internal recirculation ratio, induced by a cyclonic fluid-dynamic pattern obtained by the geometrical configuration of the reactor and of the feeding system. The facility was designed to independently vary the mixture pre-heating temperatures and the mixture dilution levels.The experimental results suggest that the cyclonic configuration represents a challenging choice to stabilize the oxidation process in small-size applications. It contains the pollutants emission for a large range of preheating temperature \u2013 mixture dilution levels extending the burner operability conditions.",

Turbulence\u2013chemistry interaction is treated with an assumed pdf approach, with the variance obtained from a transport equation. Radiation is computed by the discrete ordinates method and the grey weighted sum of grey gases model.

The simulation results show that the flamelet LES approach can successfully describe the flow field and combustion inside the furnace; major species and velocities are found in good agreement with the experiment.The results are further analyzed with a focus on the processes of particle heating, devolatilization, char combustion and flame stabilization in a highly turbulent environment. Additionally, the relative importance of scalar dissipation rate is highlighted, showing a large separation of mixing scales between volatile and char off-gas combustion due to the long residence time and generally much lower scalar dissipation rates than typical for lab-scale experiments.",

This work aimed to investigate the sulfur evolution behavior and performance of copper ore oxygen carrier (OC) within the CLOU process using a typical high-sulfur content coal in Sichuan (SC), China as fuel. Experiments at different temperatures and oxygen to fuel ratios were conducted in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor and comparisons have been made between SC coal and Gaoping (GP) anthracite with low sulfur content. It was found that both the increase of temperature and decrease of oxygen to fuel ratio can enhance the generation of sulfurous gases. There were two SO2 peaks during the CLOU process of both SC and GP coals, due to the two relatively independent stages of coal combustion process: volatiles combustion and coal char combustion. The second peak was generally more sensitive to temperature, and a higher temperature would contribute to much more SO2 generation. Cyclic redox experimental results of SC coal in fluidized bed reactor showed stable sulfur evolution trend and moderate reactivity of copper ore OC. Moreover, calcium oxide (CaO) was introduced as desulfurizing agent to remove the sulfurous gases generated in the CLOU process of SC coal and the desulfurization efficiency was achieved as high as 98%. XRD and XPS analyses showed that no metallic sulfide was detected on the surface of the reduced OC samples and ESEM images indicated that no serious sintering problem occurred to the used particles.",

Turbulent flames are simulated as statistically stationary following a Lagrangian framework using an inflow\u2013outflow configuration. The inflow velocity is dynamically adjusted at run-time to stabilize the flame brush location within the computational domain. Linear forcing is applied inside the unburned mixtures to maintain the turbulent intensities at desired levels. For the same turbulence properties, several equivalence ratios near the lean limit are selected and it is shown that the normalized turbulent flame speed is a function of the equivalence ratio. Velocity and length scales of the imposed turbulence are then selected in such a way that the Karlovitz and Damk\u00f6hler numbers remain constant for flames of different equivalence ratios. Simulations are run for more than 80 eddy turnover times and the turbulent flame speed is derived by averaging the inflow velocity. The results show that equivalence ratio does not have an explicit effect on the normalized turbulent flame speed above the lean limit. Analysis of flame surface area shows that surface wrinkling generated by eddies of different scales is not affected by variation in equivalence ratios when the Karlovitz and Damk\u00f6hler numbers are fixed. Furthermore, flame surface generated by large-scale eddies is independent of the Karlovitz and Damk\u00f6hler numbers. Examining the flame surface statistics, it is shown that the flame surface normal is preferentially parallel to the most compressive strain rate direction for all equivalence ratios.",

First, the ignition behaviors of a single-point laser breakdown spark ignition were investigated. The results indicated that the effect of the focusing lens on the minimum ignition energy (MIE) was limited in terms of the absorbed energy. Although the MIE at 1.0\u00a0MPa was lower than that at 0.1\u00a0MPa near the stoichiometric equivalence relationship was reversed near the lean limit. For lean mixtures, local quenching of the initial flame kernel was clearly observed including third lobe region especially at 1.0\u00a0MPa. In the case of the close dual-point sparks for an equivalence ratio of 0.6, formation of a third lobe was suppressed. When the dual spark gap was large, two flame kernels were formed as observed in the case of the single spark. An optimal gap in which the absorbed energy was minimal for successful ignition existed depending on the pressure, although the magnitude of the associated energy was not so different from that in the case of the single spark. However, the growth rate of the initial flame kernel formed by the close dual sparks was considerably higher than that formed by the single spark, especially at 1.0\u00a0MPa.

The plasma vibrational temperature of the spark discharge can be measured using time series emission spectra from the electrically excited CN* violet band system. The gas rotational temperature of the initial flame kernel can also be measured using emission spectra from OH* radicals (P and R branches). Simultaneously, visualization of the spark discharge and a time series of emission spectra inside a spark-ignition engine were performed under homogeneous mixture conditions, to eliminate the effects of stratification of temperature and mixture concentrations around the spark plug. We discuss thermal energy transfer from the spark discharge to the combustible mixture. The main conclusions that can be drawn from this study are as follows.

Previously, it was demonstrated that the introduction of a combined swirl\u2013tumble flow recovered combustion stability, which was otherwise lost when increasing the engine speed from 1000 to 2000\u00a0rpm. However, the improved combustion came at the expense of elevated engine-out soot emissions. Here, high-speed combustion luminosity and PIV measurements at 2000\u00a0rpm confirm that soot incandescence is more prevalent with high swirl and tumble. The application of high-speed infrared (IR) gasoline-vapor imaging introduced here provides unique insights, revealing that operation with a combination of swirl and tumble generates an asymmetric fuel distribution that spatially correlates with highly luminous sooting combustion. The IR fuel-vapor imaging technique collects line-of-sight mid-infrared thermal emission from the CH stretch band of the heated fuel near a wavelength of 3.4\u00a0\u00b5m. The IR images resolve the penetrating vapor plumes distinctly, demonstrating that the 3.4\u00a0\u00b5m band is suitable for quantitative measurements of vapor penetration during injection. After injection, the IR images provide a qualitative description of fuel-vapor spread without combustion. It is found that the no-swirl case has a symmetric fuel-vapor development during the latter part of the compression stroke. In contrast, for operation with strong swirl and tumble, vapor rotation and the development of an asymmetric and non-uniform fuel-vapor distribution is observed. PIV measurements reveal that the swirl flow dominates the vapor rotation, while the tumble flow appears to be a major reason for the asymmetric fuel-vapor distribution.",

TPIV measurements were performed after a single-injection from a hollow-cone spray when particle distributions were suited for accurate particle reconstruction. High-speed PIV (HS-PIV) measurements (4.8 kHz) were combined with phase-locked TPIV measurements (3.3 Hz) to provide the time history of the 2D2C flow-field preceding TPIV. HS-PIV is also used to validate TPIV measurements within the z = 0 mm plane. TPIV uncertainties of 12% are assessed for non-injection operation. TPIV is used to spatially resolve spray-induced turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), shear (S), and vorticity (\u03a9) distributions. The added 3D3C velocity information is capable of resolving 3D shear layers that produce spatially-coherent 3D turbulent vortical structures, which are anticipated to augment fuel\u2013air mixing. Measurements spatially quantify the increase of these parameters from injection and quantity distributions reveal significant differences to non-injection operation. The isosurface density ( \u03c1 \u00af ), defined as the volume percentage for which a flow parameter exceeds a given value, is used to identify distributions of the largest TKE, S, and \u03a9 magnitudes. Distributions quantify the increase of TKE, S, and \u03a9 from injection and describe the decay of spray-induced turbulence with time. At \u03c1 \u00af values below 10%, fuel injection increases TKE, S, and \u03a9 magnitudes in excess of 400% compared to the tumble flow without injection. Magnitudes remained 2-times larger than non-injection operation 16 crank-angle degrees (CADs) after injection. This indicates that spray-induced turbulence enhancement can remain for a significant time after injection. Measurements and analyses provide insight into spray-induced turbulence phenomena and are anticipated to support predictive model development for engine sprays.",

The engine was operated at part-load. A triple injection scheme was applied late during compression to generate stratified fuel/air mixtures. These operating conditions are prone to cyclic variations. The large-scale tumble flow caused cycle-to-cycle variations in the spray shape. This was followed by cycle-to-cycle variations in combustion, which was characterized by the indicated mean effective pressure. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry was applied simultaneously in two parallel planes to account for the three-dimensional nature of transient in-cylinder flows. The focus was on the influence of the evolution of the large-scale tumble flow on combustion. The planes were 18\u00a0mm apart and located in the central tumble plane and one mid-valve plane. The central tumble plane is located below the fuel injector and spark plug; the mid-valve plane is below the center of one pair of intake and exhaust valves. Correlation analyses were performed to identify the flow features responsible for cycle-to-cycle variations in spray and combustion. By correlating single velocity vectors in the central tumble plane with indicated mean effective pressures, two flow regions important to combustion were identified: A flow above the piston, which had a significant impact on spray evolution, and a flow along the cylinder head, pointing from the injector toward the spark plug. By tracing in-cylinder flows backward in time, a clear correlation between flow features in the central tumble plane and the mid-valve plane was observed.",

     "abstract": "This experimental study demonstrates the potential to apply the thermochemical fuel reforming (TFR) concept to simultaneously reduce emissions and improve brake specific fuel consumption in a spark-ignition natural gas engine. CH4, H2 and CO are the major components of TFR exhaust gas over a range of rich equivalence ratios. A numerical analysis is conducted to illustrate the chemical reaction pathways for H2 and CO formation, which occurs in the cylinder during the TFR process. The main reaction pathways for H2 and CO formation under 3 modeling conditions (20%, 50% and 80% fuel consumed) are different from each other. According to the experimental analysis, thermochemical fuel reforming gas improves combustion performance and accelerates the burn rate in every phase of the natural gas engine. Combustion stability, brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake specific hydrocarbon (BSHC) and brake specific carbon monoxide (BSCO) emissions can also be improved by TFR. The brake specific oxides of nitrogen (BSNOx) emissions for natural gas engines, combined with a TFR system, are still lower than those of an original natural gas engine in the same operation mode. Thermochemical fuel reforming has been shown to be effective in simultaneously reducing emissions and improving thermal efficiency for a spark-ignition natural gas engine. Furthermore, a 1.2 equivalence ratio for cylinder 4 (TFR cylinder) can be recommended in future research on TFR optimization, based on BSFC and combustion stability.",

The Research Octane Numbers (RONs) of these three fuels are first measured and compared to historical data. Autoignition of pentane/air mixtures in the CFR engine are then simulated using a two-zone model with detailed chemical kinetics. Initial and boundary conditions for these kinetic simulations are systematically calibrated using engine simulation software. Two published, detailed kinetic mechanisms for these fuels are tested with a published NO sub-mechanism incorporated into them. Simulations using both of these mechanisms demonstrate autoignition in the engine for all three pentanes, and that residual NO promotes autoignition, as found in previous studies. Differences between these two mechanisms and the engine experiments are nonetheless observed, and these differences are consistent with those observed in simulations of published rapid compression machine (RCM) data. Comparison of the RCM and the CFR engine modelling also suggests the need for high accuracy experiments and high-fidelity models due to the significant impact that small differences in autoignition timing can potentially produce in real engines.",

An in-house SI engine model was used to derive temperature and pressure profiles of the end gas with and without external-EGR for various ERFs, and then the ignition delay was measured by using a rapid compression machine along the derived temperature-pressure paths. The effect of external-EGR on the ignition delay of the simulated end gas was divided into two effects affecting the auto-ignition behavior: composition effect and temperature effect, then each effect was evaluated separately. As a result, the composition effect by adding external-EGR was maximized when the fuel is ERF10. With a regression analysis, it was found that there is the correlation between the amount of composition effect and the amount of pre-heat release in the end gas during a flame propagation; therefore, it is understood that ERF10 shows the most sensitive composition effect due to its pre-heat release characteristic. On the other hand, ERF with higher ethanol content was more sensitive to temperature effect by external-EGR on the ignition delay. It is found out that the amount of temperature effect depends mainly on latent heat of fuel; therefore, high latent heat of ethanol in ERF leads to its being influenced more by temperature effect. Consequently, ERF10 has the highest external-EGR sensitivity in anti-knock behavior at RON test condition, and it is further discussed that the optimum ERF for external-EGR strategy could vary from ERF0 to ERF10 according to different engine operating conditions.",

The possibility of producing high anti-knock quality gasoline by blending high-octane bio-derived components with low octane naphtha streams is attractive. 2-phenyl ethanol (2-PE), is one such potential candidate that can be derived from lignin, a biomass component made of interconnected aromatic groups. We first ascertained the blending anti-knock quality of 2-PE by studying the effect of spark advancement on knock for various blends 2-PE, toluene, and ethanol with naphtha in a cooperative fuels research engine. The blending octane quality of 2-PE indicated an anti-knock behavior similar or slightly greater than that of toluene, and ethylbenzene, which could be attributed to either chemical kinetics or charge cooling effects. To isolate chemical kinetic effects, a model for 2-PE auto-ignition was developed and validated using ignition delay times measured in a high-pressure shock tube. Simulated ignition delay times of 2-PE were also compared to those of traditional high-octane gasoline blending components to show that the gas phase reactivity of 2-PE is lower than ethanol, and comparable to toluene, and ethylbenzene at RON, and MON relevant conditions. The gas-phase reactivity of 2-PE is largely controlled by its aromatic ring, while the effect of the hydroxyl group is minimal. The higher blending octane quality of 2-PE compared to toluene, and ethylbenzene can be attributed primarily to the effect of the hydroxyl group on increasing heat of vaporization.",

The correlation between flame propagation velocity at the moment of autoignition and knock intensity was confirmed. The findings revealed that unburned mass fraction and initial temperature did not directly affect knock intensity. Additionally, experimental results were analyzed based on theories proposed by Zeldovich and Bradley. The results of the analysis indicated that smaller gradients of autoignition delay time and temperature caused the higher flame propagation velocity and the resultant higher knock intensity. It was concluded that initial temperature affected both the gradient of autoignition delay time and that of temperature, which in turn indirectly influenced the knock intensities.",

     "abstract": "End-gas autoignition has direct relevance to engine knock and thereby has been extensively studied. However, in the literature there are still some contradictions on how different factors affect end-gas autoignition and knock intensity. Specifically, there is contradictory literature on (1) whether faster combustion may promote or inhibit end-gas autoignition and engine knock, and (2) whether knock intensity increases or decreases with burned mass fraction (BMF). To answer these two questions, one-dimensional flame propagation and end-gas autoignition in a closed cylindrical chamber are investigated and the effects of flame propagation speed and chamber size on end-gas autoignition are examined in this study. In the transient numerical simulation, two fuels, hydrogen and iso-octane, are studied; and detailed chemistry is considered. It is shown that if the flame propagation is fast enough or the chamber is small enough, end-gas autoignition and knock can be prevented; otherwise, the knock intensity may increase as the flame propagation speed increases or as the chamber size decreases. The maximum pressure is found to change non-monotonically with the BMF as well as the flame propagation speed and chamber size. This helps to explain why there is contradictory literature on those two questions mentioned above. The answers to these two questions depend on the amount of unburned mixture at the moment of end-gas autoignition: if there is enough unburned mixture before end-gas autoignition, the maximum pressure increases with the flame propagation speed and BMF; otherwise, the opposite trend occurs. Besides, comparison between the results for hydrogen and iso-octane indicates that end-gas chemical reaction and heat release occurring before autoignition can greatly reduce the maximum pressure.",

Chemistry is represented by a reduced kinetics mechanism containing 74 species and 976 reactions (reduced from CaltechMech). The effect of pressure has been isolated by fixing the Karlovitz numbers, the Lewis numbers, and the ratio of integral length scale to laminar flame thickness. On one hand, the results suggest that pressure has very limited effect on the mean heat release rate, such that turbulent burning velocity is proportional to the turbulent surface area. In addition, while the chemical pathways are strongly affected by pressure in laminar flames, the global effect of turbulence on these pathways is negligible, independent of pressure. On the other hand, the local distribution of heat release rate was found to be significantly affected by pressure through differential diffusion-chemistry effects.",

Radiation is solved with the discrete ordinate method (DOM) including grey radiative properties from soot and gaseous species in the Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) framework. At Spray A conditions (60\u00a0bar), the contribution to the Planck mean absorption coefficient from gas-phase species (mainly CO2 and H2O) was found to be comparable to the one of soot, this plays an important role for the radiation reabsorption in the periphery of the jet. Radiation was found to reduce the flame temperature by 10\u201320\u00a0K with a consequent reduction of the total NO mass by approximately 5\u201310%, with these reductions being comparable for both combustion models. However, neglecting turbulent fluctuations results in an increase of the NO mass by a factor of two. The effect of TRI on the emitted radiation was found to be modest (10% at most). The effect of radiation on soot formation was seen to be minor. Overall, it is concluded that under Spray A conditions the effect of radiation heat transfer does influence the NO formation but the effect of the combustion model is more important and needs further attention.",

     "abstract": "In diesel engines, combustion is initiated by a two-staged autoignition that includes both low- and high-temperature chemistry. The location and timing of both stages of autoignition are important parameters that influence the development and stabilisation of the flame. In this study, a two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) is conducted to provide a fully resolved description of ignition at diesel engine-relevant conditions. The DNS is performed at a pressure of 40 atmospheres and at an ambient temperature of 900\u00a0K using dimethyl ether (DME) as the fuel, with a 30 species reduced chemical mechanism. At these conditions, similar to diesel fuel, DME exhibits two-stage ignition. The focus of this study is on the behaviour of the low-temperature chemistry (LTC) and the way in which it influences the high-temperature ignition. The results show that the LTC develops as a \u201cspotty\u201d first-stage autoignition in lean regions which transitions to a diffusively supported cool-flame and then propagates up the local mixture fraction gradient towards richer regions. The cool-flame speed is much faster than can be attributed to spatial gradients in first-stage ignition delay time in homogeneous reactors. The cool-flame causes a shortening of the second-stage ignition delay times compared to a homogeneous reactor and the shortening becomes more pronounced at richer mixtures. Multiple high-temperature ignition kernels are observed over a range of rich mixtures that are much richer than the homogeneous most reactive mixture and most kernels form much earlier than suggested by the homogeneous ignition delay time of the corresponding local mixture. Overall, the results suggest that LTC can strongly influence both the timing and location in composition space of the high-temperature ignition.",

The model is evaluated initially for a baseline non-reacting case with ambient temperature of 900\u00a0K. Results for vapour penetration lengths and the radial profiles of mixture fraction show good agreement with experiments. The model is then applied to reacting cases, featuring transient ignition and combustion with a lifted flame base. A 106-species chemistry mechanism is employed. Simulations are performed at various ambient temperatures (800\u20131100\u00a0K) and various volume fractions of ambient oxygen (13\u201321%) that correspond to conditions in both conventional and advanced diesel engines. The trend towards decreasing ignition delay time and lift-off length with increasing ambient temperature and oxygen is predicted well. The quantitative agreement between the computed and experimental ignition delay times is satisfactory. The accuracy of lift-off length predictions is less accurate but comparable to the existing literature. Better results are obtained at the conditions with lower ambient temperatures and oxygen concentrations. This outcome is explored with a detailed analysis of heat release and scalar dissipation rates under various ambient temperature conditions. It is revealed that at high ambient temperatures, flame stabilisation occurs in a region with significant turbulence\u2013chemistry interactions and close to the nozzle exit where the liquid phase would be expected to influence the flame.",

It is found that at the first ignition delay, low-temperature chemistry (LTC) represented by the isomerization of alkylperoxy radical, chain branching reactions of keto-hydroperoxide, and H-atom abstraction of n-heptane is predominant for both RCCI and SCCI combustion. In addition, explosion index and participation index analyses together with conditional means on temperature verify that low-temperature heat release (LTHR) from local mixtures with relatively-high n-heptane concentration occurs more intensively in RCCI combustion than in SCCI combustion, which ultimately advances the overall RCCI combustion and distributes its heat release rate over time. It is also found that at the onset of the main combustion, high-temperature heat release (HTHR) occurs primarily in thin deflagrations where temperature, CO, and OH are found to be the most important species for the combustion. The conversion reaction of CO to CO2 and hydrogen chemistry are identified as important reactions for HTHR.

These measurements are intended to enhance understanding of C5 autoignition chemistry, and provide experimental data to guide improvements to a general hydrocarbon oxidation mechanism. To that end, the autoignition behavior of these three C5 isomers was investigated in a modified CFR engine at an intake temperature of 120\u00a0\u00b0C and a fixed engine speed of 600\u00a0rpm to determine the critical compression ratio (CCR) at which hot ignition occurs. To find the critical compression ratio, the engine compression ratio (CR) was gradually increased to the point where CO in the engine exhaust rapidly decreased and significant high temperature heat release was observed, while holding equivalence ratio constant. Fundamental ignition behaviors such as the CCR and the calculated percentage of low temperature heat release (%LTHR) demonstrate the impact of chain length and methyl substitutions on ignition reactivity. The %LTHR shows a stronger two stage heat release for n-pentane than for neo-pentane observed at critical ignition conditions. In contrast, single stage heat release is observed for iso-pentane, leading to the weakest overall oxidation reactivity of the three isomers. Key reaction paths forming conjugate alkenes and C5 oxygenated species control the autoignition reactivity of n-pentane and iso-pentane within the low temperature and NTC regimes. However, neo-pentane forms no conjugate alkene due to its unique molecular structure, and instead produces iso-butene to retard its oxidation.",

We discuss a simple, robust method for this coupling, based on an additional variable, namely the normalized strength of molecular transport. The implementation and behavior of the resulting coupled model are shown. To demonstrate the performance of the model, numerical simulations of representative combustion scenarios are performed, both with fully detailed calculations and with the reduced model.

In the high-temperature regime, however, the difference between RCCI and SCCI combustion becomes marginal because the ignition of the PRF/air mixture is highly-sensitive to T\u2032 rather than PRF\u2032 and \u03d5\u2032. The Damk\u00f6hler number analysis verifies that the mean HRR is more distributed over time with increasing r because the portion of deflagration mode of combustion becomes larger with increasing fuel stratification. Finally, it is found that the overall combustion of both RCCI and SCCI cases becomes more like the 0-D ignition with increasing u\u2032 due to the homogenization of initial mixture by turbulent mixing.",

     "abstract": "According to the reactivity gradient theory of Zel'dovich, the non-uniformity in temperature or concentration can lead to detonation development under certain conditions. In the literature, there are many studies on detonation development caused by temperature gradient or hot spot. However, the modes of supersonic reaction front propagation and detonation development regime caused by concentration non-uniformity have not been investigated previously. In this study, one-dimensional simulations were conducted to investigate the transient autoignition and reaction front propagation processes in n-heptane/air mixture with concentration non-uniformity. With the increase of equivalence ratio gradient, three modes (supersonic autoignitive reaction front, developing detonation and subsonic reaction front) of reaction front propagation induced by concentration non-uniformity were identified. The effects of heat conduction and mass diffusion on these three modes were examined and it was demonstrated that molecular diffusion has little influence on the first two modes. The detonation development regime caused by concentration non-uniformity was reported in this paper. This regime was found to be similar to the one caused by temperature gradient. A non-dimensional parameter was proposed to characterize the lower limit of the detonation regime. Furthermore, the effects of initial temperature on the detonation development regime were examined. It was found that the detonation development regime becomes wider as the initial temperature decreases. The initial temperature was shown to only have great impact on the upper limit of the detonation development regime while it has little influence on the lower limit. The influence of initial temperature was explained using the volumetric energy density of the mixture.",

As one of the simplest fuels with low-temperature chemistry, dimethyl ether (DME) is considered in this study and one-dimensional autoignitive reaction front propagation induced by temperature gradient is simulated for stoichiometric DME/air mixtures considering detailed chemistry and transport. The emphasis is placed on assessing and interpreting the influence of initial temperature on the detonation development regime. Different initial temperatures below, within and above the negative-temperature coefficient (NTC) region are considered. For each initial temperature, four typical autoignition modes are identified: supersonic autoignitive reaction front (without detonation); detonation development; transonic reaction front; and subsonic reaction front. The detonation development regimes for two fuels, DME and n-heptane, at the same initial temperature and those for the same fuel, DME, at three different initial temperatures respectively below, within and above the NTC region are obtained. Based on these results, the influence of fuel type and initial temperature on detonation development regime are discussed. It is found that the detonation development regime becomes narrower at higher initial temperature. Moreover, the influence of initial temperature on reaction front propagation speed is investigated. The reaction front propagation speed is shown to be strongly affected by different chemistries involved in low and high temperature regions. When only the high-temperature chemistry is involved, the reaction front propagation speed is shown to be less dependent on the initial temperature.",

The octane number was derived from the fuel-substitution methodology in terms of the octane primary reference fuel (PRF, consisting of n-heptane and isooctane) mixture needed to maintain combustion phasing during homogeneous-charge compression-ignition (HCCI) engine operation as increasing amounts of the SRF mixture was substituted for the PRF mixture. A linear blending relationship was found to exist between the cetane and octane numbers.

Experiments were performed in a single-cylinder diesel engine fuelled with directly-injected 95 RON gasoline at 2\u00a0bar IMEP. Engine speed was set to 1500\u00a0rpm. Intake pressure was set to 1\u00a0bar in order to investigate typical low load operating conditions. Chemical computation revealed that the O atoms coming from the O3 molecules and responsible for promoting fuel autoignition exhibited a maximum concentration near 30\u00b0 before TDC. Experiments showed that a narrow umbrella angle extends the early injections range up to -60 CAD, better matching with ozone decomposition. Injection timing can be employed to better exploit the oxidizing effect of ozone, which proved to be dependent on local conditions of temperature, equivalence ratio, and concentration of O atoms and of the residual NO trapped after each combustion cycle. Results showed that the impact of ozone is generally higher at early injection, but that interaction between O3 molecules and NO contained in the trapped gas can drastically reduce or even make the promoting effect of ozone ineffective. Finally, seeding the intake of the engine with ozone is shown to be an effective way to improve the autoignition propensity of high octane fuel and to overcome the low load limitation of D-I GCI engines.",

Based on a primary reference fuel oxidation mechanism and a C1\u2013C4 hydrocarbon flame ionization mechanism, a skeletal mechanism for gasoline flame ionization process prediction on HCCI engines was developed in this paper. Since the ion concentrations significantly affect the aroused ion current signals, the mechanism is targeted on accurately predicting both the ion production concentrations and other key combustion characteristics. Through the comparison with the results from the detailed gasoline flame ionization mechanism and experimental results, the predicted maximum hydronium (H3O+) ion concentration and the concentration variation tendency are validated. Additionally, the auto-ignition delay time (tign) accurately predicted under HCCI engine conditions. Through coupling with a 3D-CFD engine model, the skeletal mechanism was applied to predict the important information of in-cylinder ion species, which are validated by the experimental ion current amplitudes and phases. The results show that the ion current phase (Ion50) matches well with the positions where the predicted ion concentration reaches its maximum, and the ion current amplitudes are well predicted under the conditions of different equivalence ratios (\u03a6) and fuel injection ratios (Injratio).",

     "abstract": "This paper presents a doubly conditional moment closure (DCMC) as an a posteriori predictive modelling tool for ignition of mixtures with large thermal stratification in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) conditions. Double conditioning is applied on enthalpy and its dissipation rate. The performance of the DCMC model is evaluated using a number of previously reported direct numerical simulations (DNSs) with various fuels. The DNSs modelled ignition of various lean homogeneous mixtures with a high level of temperature inhomogeneities. The selected cases exhibit a prevalence of deflagration mode of combustion as opposed to a spontaneous ignition-front mode, which has proven challenging for previous singly CMC. In all simulations, DCMC solver is run in a stand-alone mode with certain terms, such as the probability density functions of enthalpy and dissipation rate, being provided using the DNS input. The DCMC results are in a very good agreement with the DNS data, and are significantly improved compared with a singly conditional moment closure. A set of a posteriori DNS-DCMC tests is also performed to demonstrate importance of various terms in the doubly CMC equations. These tests first reveal that the effects of the cross dissipation and sources of enthalpy and dissipation rate (which lead to convective terms in conditional space) are insignificant and these terms can be safely neglected from the DCMC equations. The significance of this result is that the main unclosed models that would be needed for satisfactory results in a practical simulation of an engine would be the joint probably density function of enthalpy and its dissipation rate and the dissipation rate of dissipation rate.",

The main objectives were to quantify the observed ignition characteristics and numerically validate the theory of the turbulent ignition regime diagram recently proposed by Im et al. 2015 [29] that provides a framework to predict ignition behavior a priori based on the thermo-chemical properties of the reactant mixture and initial flow and scalar field conditions. Ignition regimes were classified into three categories: weak (where deflagration is the dominant mode of fuel consumption), reaction-dominant strong, and mixing-dominant strong (where volumetric ignition is the dominant mode of fuel consumption). Two-dimensional (2D) direct numerical simulations (DNS) of auto-ignition in a lean syngas/air mixture with uniform mixture composition at high-pressure, low-temperature conditions were performed in a fixed volume. The initial conditions considered two-dimensional isotropic velocity spectrums, temperature fluctuations and localized thermal hot spots. A number of parametric test cases, by varying the characteristic turbulent Damk\u00f6hler and Reynolds numbers, were investigated. The evolution of the auto-ignition phenomena, pressure rise, and heat release rate were analyzed. In addition, combustion mode analysis based on front propagation speed and computational singular perturbation (CSP) was applied to characterize the auto-ignition phenomena. All results supported that the observed ignition behaviors were consistent with the expected ignition regimes predicted by the theory of the regime diagram. This work provides new high-fidelity data on syngas ignition characteristics over a broad range of conditions and demonstrates that the regime diagram serves as a predictive guidance in the understanding of various physical and chemical mechanisms controlling auto-ignition in thermally inhomogeneous and compositionally homogeneous turbulent reacting flows.",

The light-round process corresponding to the flame spreading phase in the ignition of annular combustors is examined in this article by performing experiments in a model scale configuration \u201cMICCA-Spray\u201d. This system features 16 swirling injectors each comprising a hollow cone pressurized injector. Experiments are carried out with premixed gases as well as n-heptane and dodecane sprays. The flow, spray and flame are first characterized in a single injector configuration. Propagation from the initial kernel created by a spark plug is then observed using high speed light emission imaging. This provides flame structures at various times during the process and gives access to the time delays for flame merging. With n-heptane and dodecane fuel injection, it is found that the light-round process is similar to the one observed under fully premixed propane/air experiments but the duration of the process is augmented especially for the less volatile fuel. It is also confirmed that the delay is notably influenced by thermal conditions prevailing in the chamber at the moment of ignition, injection process and fuel composition. Making use of a flamelet like model of the combustion process, the relative changes in light-round time delay are found to be, to the first order, proportional to the relative changes in laminar burning velocity induced by the fuel spray in the air flow.",

Experiments were performed to validate the inverse method. A semi-infinite probe system was used to measure the pressure perturbations in the tube, to avoid the high temperature damaging the microphone. Before the pressure measurements were taken, calibration was performed for the semi-infinite probe system to obtain accurate pressure data in the tube. The experiments were performed in three steps. First, the localization of a pure sound source in the tube at ambient temperature was studied. Second, localization of a pure sound source at hot conditions was considered. Third, the pure sound source was replaced with an unsteady heat source, and pressure data were used to determine the position of the unsteady heat source. Results show that calibration and the regularization are both necessary for the determination of the sound source position in the tube. Meanwhile, at the hot and heat release rate conditions, with the consideration of the temperature distribution in the thermoacoustic model, the position of the sound source and the unsteady heat release source can be determined successfully.",

Using pressure time-series data obtained at multiple locations around the annulus the phenomenon of mode switching is investigated through the spin ratio, the orientation of the nodal lines and the envelope of the pressure oscillations. These three parameters all suggest that mode switching events occur almost periodically, and over azimuthal convective time scales. Moreover, analysis of the spin ratio and orientation of the nodal lines show that these parameters are correlated, and that their mean rates of change or trajectories also have a preferred direction. Therefore, these quantities were found to oscillate backwards and forwards in-phase with each other, as opposed to the mode simply rotating in one direction, providing new insight into the nature of modal dynamics of self-excited azimuthal modes.",

The increase in the H2 composition of the fuel altered FMS from a longitudinal fundamental mode (\u2248250\u00a0Hz) to a 7th harmonic mode (\u22481750\u00a0Hz). The cause and characteristics of this FMS were investigated using OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (OH-PLIF) measured at 10\u00a0Hz, particle-image velocimetry (PIV), and the flame transfer function (FTF).The convection time (\u03c4conv) was assumed to be the key parameter of the FMS. Thus, tests were conducted to determine the air flow rate ( V \u02d9 air ) and equivalence ratio (\u03c6) variation, which are vital parameters of the \u03c4conv in terms of the flame length and mixing time. The \u03c6 variation caused obvious changes in the flame length and instability frequency/mode, while the V \u02d9 air variation did not. The \u03c4conv was analyzed by calculating the global convection time (\u03c4conv_global) and the real convection time (\u03c4conv_real) from the length of the OH-PLIF-based unburned mixture length divided by the averaged mixture nozzle exit velocity. The \u03c4conv_real was calculated from the integral of the real velocity determined from PIV. Both calculations showed an inverse correlation between \u03c4conv and CI frequency, which particularly signifies that the FMS is controllable and a specific mode of CI can be generated by adjusting the \u03c4conv. The FTF was measured to determine the intrinsic characteristics of the flame. The FTF phase was normalized by the Strouhal number (St) and identified a direct relationship between FTF gain and \u03c4conv variation.In conclusion, the \u03c4conv is the main reason for the FMS.

Pixel-by-pixel multiplication of OH and CH2O fluorescence signals was conducted to estimate the reacting JICF flame front. The simultaneous PLIF-PIV measurements allowed for an in-depth study of the interaction between the flame and the flowfield. The flame structure was divided into two branches, a windward and leeward flame branch. The unsteady windward flame exhibited both attached and lifted flame behavior, while the leeward flame branch remained consistently attached at the jet exit. In some cases, formaldehyde signal was observed upstream of the windward flame base, suggesting the build-up of a radical pool due to mixing between the jet reactants and hot crossflow. Both flame branches were anchored in the jet shear layer, but with increasing distance from the jet exit the flames moved inside the shear layers. Small scale vortices caused local wrinkling of the flame front. The windward flame was observed to wrap around the large-scale vortices that formed along the jet shear layer. The large-scale structures distorted the flame front but the associated strain-rate was typically lower than that imparted by the small-scale structures. The leeward flame edge aligned with regions of high principal extensive strain-rate and high dilatation. On the other hand, the windward flame edge was located in regions where principal extensive and principal compressive strain rate magnitudes were high and dilatation was low. The results suggest that auto-ignition is the dominant flame stabilization mechanism for the unsteady windward flame and premixed flame propagation is the more dominant stabilization mechanism for the leeward flame branch.",

The effect of forcing frequency is investigated, and it is found that the excitation can be well controlled into a standing wave oscillation over a range of amplitudes for selected frequencies. However, close to the natural frequency of the system, the modal dynamics cannot be well controlled, and instead these tend towards their self-excited state, resulting in a mixed mode.

The analysis of the unsteady pressure fluctuations within the combustor suggests that the intermittency prior to and post thermoacoustic instability are of type II. We also compare the flame dynamics during either state using high speed Mie scattering images acquired simultaneously with unsteady pressure. We observe that during both regimes of intermittency, the flame switches between two distinct patterns of oscillations; one where the flame oscillates in an aperiodic manner due to the inherent turbulent fluctuations, and another where the flame exhibits periodic roll-up as a consequence of the periodic vortex shedding at the dump plane. Nevertheless, it is observed that the flame dynamics during intermittency prior to and post the occurrence of thermoacoustic instability are different. During intermittency before the occurrence of thermoacoustic instability, the flame along the inner shear layer is stabilized by the stagnation point flow behind the bluff body. In contrast, during intermittency after the occurrence of thermoacoustic instability, the flame along the inner shear layer is stabilized by the recirculation zone created by the bluff body.",

We find that, when similar bulk flow conditions are imposed in the ORZ, the transition is governed by the extinction strain rate and can occur at different adiabatic flame temperature and unstretched laminar burning velocity. First, we show that an important non-dimensional parameter characterizing the flow in the ORZ, that is the Strouhal number associated with the azimuthal ORZ spinning frequency, is independent of the Reynolds number and has the same constant value in air and oxy-combustion ( S t = f O R Z . D i n U i n , b u l k \u2248 0.12 ). This has the important implication that the inlet velocity is a more relevant parameter choice than the inlet Reynolds number in order to maintain similar flow conditions in the ORZ. Next, by comparing the extinction strain rates \u2013 computed at the measured ORZ temperature \u2013 we show the existence of a single correlation between the inverse of the ORZ spinning frequency (taken as a characteristic ORZ flow time) and the inverse of the extinction strain rate (taken as a characteristic flame time) valid for both air and oxy flames and delimiting the regions of existence of different flame macrostructures.",

Investigation of source term contributions reveals that the swirl number affects the order of contribution levels of some sources, while the equivalence ratio influences the fluctuation amplitude of the time derivative value of disturbance energy. It is shown that source terms related to fluctuations of entropy and heat sources are major contributors to disturbance energy growth and decay, respectively. In addition to these major terms, source terms related to non-equilibrium combustion chemistry are also determined to be influential to the time evolution of disturbance energy. The relation between disturbance energy generation and flame characteristics is discussed, based on the time\u2013averaged distributions of some of the abovementioned important sources.",

The reduction of the mechanism is first presented and validated in the burner operating conditions on canonical cases. Then, comparisons of LES results with the experimental data show the excellent agreement of velocity statistics and a good agreement in terms of flame shape and exhaust pollutant prediction. The turbulent flame structure is further analyzed and compared with laminar unstrained and strained flames. Unmixedness and strain are found to significantly impact pollutant formation and flame stabilization. The ARC/TFLES strategy accounts for these effects with a very good compromise between cost and accuracy.",

     "abstract": "This paper proposes and compares two nonlinear time-domain models of self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations of laminar premixed flames. Both models are hybrid formulations, where the flame and its immediate vicinity are resolved with a reactive flow simulation, while the acoustic field is modeled with a low-order model that is coupled to the reactive flow simulation. Firstly, a flame model based on the fully compressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations is investigated. In this case, the flame simulation is coupled to the low-order model via the characteristic wave amplitudes at the inlet boundary. Secondly, the flame is resolved with a low Mach number reactive flow simulation. In order to include two-way thermoacoustic feedback, this flame model is coupled with an acoustic network model via the global heat release rate and the fluctuation of the axial velocity at a reference position upstream of the flame. A bifurcation analysis using the plenum length as bifurcation parameter is conducted. Both models exhibit complex nonlinear oscillations and are in good agreement with each other. Therefore, we conclude that the coupling of a linear acoustic model and a nonlinear flame model via reference velocity and global heat release rate is sufficient to accurately capture thermoacoustic oscillations of the configuration investigated. This implies that the most important nonlinearities can be attributed to hydrodynamic effects and flame kinematics. Furthermore, the study corroborates that premixed flames respond predominantly to fluctuations of the upstream flow velocity.",

Unsteady heat release generates acoustic waves that travel back from the flame to the burner mouth, where they modulate the velocity and thereby close an intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback loop. The present paper demonstrates that corresponding ITA eigenmodes are in general important for the dynamics and stability of premixed combustion systems. It is shown that the complete set of eigenmodes of a combustor test rig should be interpreted as the sum of acoustic and ITA eigenmodes. A procedure is presented which allows to distinguish between eigenmodes that may be considered as acoustic modes driven by the flame, versus those resulting from ITA feedback (but influenced by the acoustic properties of the combustor). This procedure is based on a factorization of the dispersion relation of the thermoacoustic model. Differences between the acoustic and intrinsic eigenmodes of a combustor test rig, in particular the corresponding mode shapes, are discussed. The paradoxical observation that increased acoustic losses at the boundaries may destabilize a combustion system is explained as an instability of the dominant ITA mode.",

     "abstract": "One of the key elements in the prediction of thermoacoustic oscillations is the determination of the acoustic response of flames as an element in an acoustic network, in the form of a flame describing function (FDF). In order to obtain a response, flames often have to be confined into a system with its own acoustic response. Separating the pure flame response and that of the system can be complicated by the non-linear effects that the flame can have on the overall system response. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to obtain a flame response via the usual methods of dynamic chemiluminescence and pressure measurements, starting from an unforced system with incipient self-excitations at a given frequency fs, in the form of a stabilized flame at atmospheric pressure with a 700\u00a0mm tube as a combustor. The flame is forced at discrete frequencies from 20 to 400\u00a0Hz, away from the self-excitation, and the response of the flame is measured using OH* chemiluminescence. This response was compared to a flame response measured in a short tube with no other excitations.The results show that both the gain and phase can be entirely dominated by the behavior of the self-excitation, so that in general it is not possible to extract reliable gain and phase information as if the forced and self-excited modes acted independently and linearly. Although the gain in this particular case was not significantly affected, the phase information of the original flame became dominated by the triggered self-excitation. Boundary conditions and systems used for flame acoustic forcing therefore need to be carefully controlled whenever there is a possibility of self-excitation.",

By using an adjoint method and introducing the intrinsic sensitivity, (i) the interaction between the acoustic and hydrodynamic subsystems is calculated and (ii) the role of the global acceleration term, which is the coupling term from the acoustics to the hydrodynamics, is analyzed.

Two types of behavior were observed during time sequences with constant amplitude pressure oscillations. For the first behavior, a region with out-of-phase pressure and heat release rate oscillations moved upstream along the nozzle shear layer towards the nozzle. For the second behavior, transitions occurred between out-of-phase oscillations in a region along the centerline and a toroidal region close to the nozzle. For time periods with increasing amplitude pressure fluctuations, in-phase heat release rate and pressure oscillations developed throughout the upstream portion of the combustor. These in-phase oscillations could extend along the burner centerline and towards the downstream portion of the combustor.

In the experiment, the hydroxyl (OH) chemiluminescence captured with a photomultiplier (PMT) indicated the global heat release. Furthermore, the phase-averaged flame surface density (FSD), which was calculated from the images of planar laser-induced fluorescence of the OH radical (OH-PLIF), was used to examine the local flame behavior. Global, local, and flame dynamics analyses were then used to investigate the flame oscillation. Results showed that when the perturbation level was sufficiently high, the fundamental oscillation tended to be amplified by the elevated pressure in the cases with perturbation frequencies of 61\u00a0Hz and 115\u00a0Hz. In contrast, in the cases with a frequency of 86\u00a0Hz, the fundamental oscillation was inhibited when the chamber pressure was elevated to 0.3\u00a0MPa. Analysis of flame dynamics and local flame response then showed that the effect of the pressure was affected by the phase delay between the pressure and the heat release oscillations. This was in turn dictated by the flame rollup process. Based on these analyses, it can be found that the general flame responses at different pressures showed similar trends when the perturbation frequency was the same. When the perturbation level and the pressure were sufficiently high, the fundamental mode oscillation was intensified by the elevated pressure when the heat release oscillation was in phase with the pressure fluctuation; otherwise, the fundamental oscillation tended to be inhibited. Moreover, both the strength and the distribution of the local heat release oscillations were affected by the elevated pressure.",

     "abstract": "The interaction between transverse acoustic modes and flames in a combustion chamber is investigated by considering the impact of two different mechanisms on the stability of the system. The first mechanism is generally taken into account in the acoustic energy balance of the system. It relates to the temporal fluctuations of heat release rate mainly due to the geometrical modifications of the flame structure (creation and destruction of flame surface). The method used to predict the system stability is well established and has been successfully applied in many studies. It involves an acoustic solver and a Flame Transfer (or Describing) Function (FTF/FDF) obtained experimentally or numerically by longitudinal excitation of the flame. The coupling of these two elements yields complex eigenfrequencies giving access to the stability of the system. The second mechanism, overlooked in most studies, deals with the transverse motion of the flame particularly when located near a velocity anti-node. A model (E-FAME) is developed in this article to take into account this effect. The method is mainly analytical and does not necessitate numerical or experimental data. It can be implemented easily for simple or more complex configurations. The two mechanisms are implemented in the same simple case to allow comparison. It is shown that the flame motion effect is moderate in many configurations but should not be overlooked especially when the Helmholtz number of the combustion chamber is small or when the global heat release rate is high.",

The first flame, named sV, is stabilized thanks to an internal reaction zone that modifies the air flow compared to non-reacting conditions. The second state, associated with a lifted flame, exhibits a strong thermo-acoustic instability linked to the quarter-wave mode of the chamber and piloted by a varying liquid-fuel supply to the flame. Using well-controlled air flow rate modulations, the switch from the quiet sV state to the lifted one is studied in a time-resolved fashion. The analysis shows that the sensitivity of the internal reaction zone of the sV state to perturbations is responsible for the change in flame shape which then triggers the onset of the thermo-acoustic instability.",

The analysis is based on time-resolved simultaneous measurements of flow field, flame structure and fuel distribution using combined PIV, OH-PLIF and tracer-PLIF at a rate of 10\u00a0kHz. In order to separate the effects of VF and ERF, the combustor has been operated in two configurations: a technically (i.e. partially) premixed (TP) configuration where both ERF and VF occur, and a perfectly premixed (PP) configuration where only VF are present. A particular operating condition is selected where the VF are similar for both premixing modes. The corresponding fluctuations of heat release, by contrast, exhibit considerably different spatial patterns for the two modes. In particular, periodic widening and narrowing as well as extinction and re-ignition of the flame base, and a convective motion of the flame zone are observed in the TP flame but not in the PP case. An evaluation of periodic variations of flux rates and heat release shows that the feedback loop of the TP flame includes an additional convective delay of 50\u00b0. The time-resolved measurements reveal that this delay leads to a coincidence of fuel-lean unburned gas and high velocity that induces local flame extinction and narrowing of the flame base. When the equivalence ratio later increases, the flame base re-ignites and a widened zone of increased heat release forms that is convected downstream. For the PP case, by contrast, reaction at the flame base is stable and accordingly the flame responds earlier to VF compared to the TP case. The results show that interacting VF and ERF have a strong and complex impact on the thermoacoustic response of turbulent swirl flames, and this impact depends largely on their time-delay.",

Stereo particle image velocimetry served to deduce three velocity components and to identify locations of soot based on soot scattering. The measurements complement those of other quantities in the same flames published recently. Flow fields determined for cold and reactive conditions confirm conclusions drawn from application of other laser-based diagnostics: soot is mainly formed in the inner recirculation zone which recirculates reactive, hot unburnt reaction products, and partly transported into the high-velocity in-flow regions. Oxidation air injected after two thirds of the combustor forms a stagnation zone close to the combustor axis and splits into a portion flowing downstream toward the combustor exit and one transported upstream thereby affecting the local gas composition and temperatures in the inner recirculation zone. Analysis of the instantaneous images by proper orthogonal decomposition reveals the existence of a precessing vortex core which impacts the soot distribution. Presence of soot in high-velocity/high strain rate regions where soot formation is unlikely to occur can be explained as a result of transport. Flow field characterization and the correlation with soot presence, in complement of existing data, are expected to provide a valuable contribution to soot model validation.",

As a successive work to the previous study that explored the chemical role of CO2 in pyrite decomposition, this paper is purposely designed to investigate the effects of CO2 on the oxidation of pyrrhotite generated from pyrite decomposition. Pyrrhotite oxidation in pure CO2 was respectively investigated at 900, 950 and 1000\u00a0\u00b0C on a well-designed thermo-gravimetric reactor (TGR). The time-resolved data of sample weight loss and gas evolution were collected online by a data collection module and a Horiba PG-350 gas analyzer, respectively. The solid products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results demonstrate that the influence of CO2 on the oxidation of pyrrhotite is chemical in nature. The transformation of pyrrhotite in CO2 consists of three stages, i.e., the fast weight loss stage, the slow weight loss stage and the slow weight gain stage. The mechanisms involving CO2 at these three distinct stages are quite different. At the first stage, ferrous sulfide is formed by the decomposition reaction of pyrrhotite with CO2. At the second stage, the oxidation reactions of ferrous sulfide with CO2 are responsible for the formation of magnetite or hematite. Hematite may also be formed through further oxidation of magnetite by CO2. The third stage is dominated by the oxidation of magnetite to form hematite with CO as the only gas product.",

Through the joint use of advanced instruments such as synchrotron X-ray adsorption spectroscopy and thermodynamic equilibrium calculation, it has been confirmed that, from both mass loss and penetration rate perspectives, the corrosion of low-Cr tubes under the oxy-firing mode is severe compared to the respective air-firing mode. Both flue gas-related and ash-related corrosions are responsible for tube corrosion. In contrast, the corrosion rate of high-Cr tubes (\u223c20% for SUS304 and SUS347) is comparable between the two modes, due to the protective effect of Cr-oxide. The existence of fly ash on tube surface suppressed the chlorination reaction. Oxygen is the principal element permeating into tube under the air-firing mode, whereas both oxygen and sulphur penetrated into the tube under the oxy-firing mode, accelerating sulphation/sulphidation reactions for a rapid corrosion. Although Cr2O3 forms a protective layer under the air-firing mode, it broke down due to the accelerated corrosion attack caused by sulphates/sulphide under the oxy-firing mode. The interaction between ash and tube surface promoted the formation of pure oxides and oxide complexes with the involvement of Na and Ca as well. The presence of alkali sulphates in ash promoted the sulphidation reaction, the extent of which is however tube-specific and correlates little with Cr content. The use of advanced material SUS347 was found to be the most suitable candidate for heat-exchange tubes to be used in the oxy-firing boiler burning low-rank coal such as Victorian brown coal which is rich in alkali and alkaline earth metals.",

Results show that under lean N2-diluted operating conditions there is a minor change in burner operation for all O2 concentrations considered. CO2 dilution has a far more substantial impact than N2 on flame location, heat release and operational response, which is attributed to the fundamental differences in thermodynamic and transport properties between the two gases.

     "abstract": "The paper investigates the dynamics of methane \u2013 oxygen enriched air turbulent non-premixed swirled flames and their emission characteristics. The burner configuration consists of two concentric tubes with a swirler placed in the annular part supplying the oxidant. Fuel injection is radial through holes in the central tube at the burner exit. This allows enhancing air-fuel mixing and eases flame stabilisation. Fuel is injected into the highest turbulence level regions where the local mixing is enhanced, and generating a shift from a non-premixed flame towards a partially premixed one. The idea of oxygen enrichment of the air is related to the augmentation of CO2 concentration in the flue gases to improve the CO2 capture efficiency by membranes. Stereo-Particle Image Velocimetry is used to analyse the velocity flow fields. The measurements are performed for oxygen concentrations ranging from 21% to 30%, with swirl numbers from 0.8 to 1.4 and global equivalence ratio from 0.8 to 1. Results show that combustion noticeably affects the swirling motion and that tangential velocities rapidly decrease along the axial axis. The recirculation mass flow ratio dramatically increases compared to non-reactive cases. Increasing global equivalence ratios increases the recirculation mass flow ratio contrary to oxygen enrichment effects. The exhaust gas compositions are measured using gas analysers. It is observed that NOx emissions decrease when the global equivalence ratio increases. It suggests that CO2 in the recirculated burned gases could be responsible for NOx destruction at relatively high oxygen enrichment rates. Globally, the results show that, by combining enhanced mixing and moderate oxygen enrichment of the air, the developed and characterized new burner configuration has a good potential to be used to stabilize non-premixed fuel and oxidant streams as partially premixed low emission flames with an increased concentration of CO2 in the flue gases.",

     "abstract": "There is an increasing pressure for industry to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from combustion processes, resulting in an increased interest in the development of methods to sequester and recycle CO2 from flue gases. Current methods available to separate nitrogen and CO2 for environmental benefits, such as chemical looping combustion (CLC), are expensive at the high flow rates encountered in industry. One potential alternative is a ceramic membrane catalytic reactor, which produces pure oxygen and simultaneously conducts oxy-fuel combustion, thus, CO2\u00a0in the product stream can successfully be separated from the nitrogen in air. This work investigates the performance of a perovskite-type SrSc0.1Co0.9O3-\u03b4\u00a0(SSC) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-\u03b4\u00a0(LSCF) membrane reactors for the combustion of methane in various configurations. The ceramic membranes exploited here are oxygen semi-permeable, dense ceramic membranes based on the composite oxides with a high mixed oxygen ionic and electronic conductivity at high temperatures. The prepared SSC and LSCF hollow fibre membranes with catalysts were used to perform reactions with a methane fuel. The oxygen permeability feasibility of the membrane reactors were studied and confirmed. The CO2\u00a0selectivity at various test conditions were also reported with the maximum selectivity achieved for SSC membrane to be 85.4% while LSCF membrane achieved 87.1% CO2\u00a0selectivity.",

In this work, an extrusion\u2013spheronization method was adopted to prepare pellets with strong anti-attrition ability, and novel biomass templates of raw and defatted microalgae were used to enhance the CO2 capture performance of CaO-based pellets with low microalgae doping ratios (0.5\u20132\u00a0wt.%). Experiments without and with excessive (5\u201320\u00a0wt.%) microalgae doped pellets were also produced for comparisons. The results show that a small amount (0.5\u20132\u00a0wt.%) of microalgae was able to significantly enhance the CO2 capture capacity of the pellets. On the contrary, when excessive microalgae were doped, the interaction between CaO and the produced tar and coke from the microalgae during the initial calcination stage leads to the deactivation of the CaO-based pellets; consequently, an inferior CO2 capture capacity is observed in the initial cycle. Comprehensively considering the overall CO2 capture capacity and the cyclic stability, the addition of 2\u00a0wt.% microalgae was regarded as the optimal doping ratio. Moreover, the pellets doped with 2\u00a0wt.% of defatted microalgae (lower economic value after being defatted) display even better cyclic CO2 capture capacity. Such a low doping ratio is very promising for the practical application of the CaO-based pellets in the CLP.",

Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is of interest as oxygenated fuel additive since it presents a relative high oxygen content as compared with other additives and suitable characteristics to be used in combustion systems. The present work includes the analysis of different fundamental aspects of the DMC combustion process: its oxidation behavior (through experimental and computational analysis), its tendency to produce soot and the role of the NO presence in the reaction system. Experiments are performed under well controlled conditions using specifically designed flow reactor systems. Results obtained contribute to extend the available experimental database on DMC, and show the low tendency of DMC to form soot compared to other oxygenates and its capacity to contribute to NO reduction under specific fuel-rich conditions. Modeling calculations are able to reproduce reasonably well the experimental trends observed, and highlight the sensitivity of the results to the thermodynamic data of DMC and DMC derived species.",

     "abstract": "NH3 and HCN are the predominant NOx precursors generated from sludge steam gasification. CaO is a traditional chemical conditioner for sludge dewatering and it can also help control the emission of NOx precursors when used as an additive in coal pyrolysis. This work investigated the influence of conditioner CaO on NOx precursors evolution using an improved drop-tube/fixed-bed reactor at temperatures ranging from 873\u00a0K to 1273\u00a0K. An NH3 decomposition experiment was conducted to further verify the mechanism underlying the effects of char. Results showed that by changing the compositions and proportions of volatile-N, conditioner CaO reduced HCN production by 9.9% and 5.3%, whereas increased NH3 yield by 8.4% and 11.5% at 873\u00a0K and 1073\u00a0K, respectively. The hydrolysis of nitrile-N and HCN occurred readily in the gasification of volatiles in CaO conditioned sludge (named S-CaO). When char participated in the steam reforming of volatiles, S-CaO char showed good capacity for NH3 decomposition at 1073\u00a0K. The final amount of NH3 emissions was 11.3% lower than that of the gasification of raw sludge (named RS). CaO was able to catalyze the conversion of NH3 to N2, which can be promoted by steam. S-CaO ash was likely to oxidize NH3 to NO. However, for S-CaO char, with the synergic effect of char carbon and conditioner CaO, NH3 and NO were transformed into N2 within a short time. This demonstrated that reusing conditioner CaO during sludge steam gasification at high temperatures is a promising technology for the control of NOx precursors emissions.",

The particular focus of the work is the sulphation of alkali chlorides which is studied by means of experiments and modelling. The melting point of alkali sulphates is higher than for alkali chlorides and a high degree of alkali sulphation is hence a measure to reduce issues related to high-temperature corrosion. In the experiments a propane flame was doped with SO2 and KCl (in solution) in air and oxy-fuel atmospheres. Two alternative measurement principles were applied to quantify potassium sulphation and the paper thereby contributes with a novel experimental approach as well as unique experimental data for turbulent diffusion air and oxy-fuel flames. The degree of sulphation of the injected KCl increases substantially in oxy compared to air combustion conditions, a fact which favours the use of biomass in oxy-combustion. This is mainly due to the increased concentration of SO2 due to flue gas recycling in oxy-combustion, but also chemical effects introduced by the CO2 as well as a small effect resulting from an increased residence time in the combustor.",

However, there are limited data available for the calibration of chemical kinetics models of high-temperature H2S oxidation. Ignition delay times and laser-absorption water time histories were therefore measured in two different shock tubes around atmospheric pressure over a range of temperatures from 1445 to 2210\u00a0K for H2S-O2 mixtures diluted in 98% Ar. While modern H2S models from the literature predicted the ignition delay times with fair accuracy, the water profiles were initially very poorly predicted with the same kinetic mechanisms. A model analysis showed that the reaction R62, SH\u00a0+\u00a0HO2 \u21c6 H2S\u00a0+\u00a0O2 (in reverse), was chiefly responsible for these poor predictions. It was possible to obtain better water predictions when the rate for R62 was divided by 10. A tentative model is proposed herein, based on this assumption for R62, and good predictions were obtained for both the ignition delay times and water profiles, as well as for former high-pressure shock-tube data with H2-H2S mixtures. The present study shows that more accurate rates for the reactions R62 (SH\u00a0+\u00a0HO2 \u21c6 H2S\u00a0+\u00a0O2), R75 (SH\u00a0+\u00a0O2 \u21c6 HSO\u00a0+\u00a0O), and R46 (SH\u00a0+\u00a0SH (+M) \u21c6 HSSH (+M)) would be needed to better predict H2S combustion chemistry.",

     "abstract": "Pulverized bituminous coal was burned in a 10\u00a0W externally heated entrained flow furnace under air-combustion and three oxy-combustion inlet oxygen conditions (28, 32, and 36%). Experiments were designed to produce flames with practically relevant stoichiometric ratios (SR\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u20131.4) and constant residence times (2.3\u00a0s). Size-classified fly ash samples were collected, and measurements focused on the soot, elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC) composition of the total and ultrafine (<0.6\u00a0\u00b5m) fly ash. Results indicate that although the total fly ash carbon, as measured by loss on ignition, was always acceptably low (<2%) with all three oxy-combustion conditions lower than air-combustion, the ultrafine fly ash for both air-fired and oxy-fired combustion conditions consists primarily of carbonaceous material (50\u201395%). Carbonaceous components on particles <0.6\u00a0\u00b5m measured by a thermal optical method showed that large fractions (52\u201393%) consisted of OC rather than EC, as expected. This observation was supported by thermogravimetric analysis indicating that for the air, 28% oxy, and 32% oxy conditions, 14\u201371% of this material may be OC volatilizing between 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 550\u00a0\u00b0C with the remaining 29\u201386% being EC/soot. However, for the 36% oxy condition, OC may comprise over 90% of the ultrafine carbon with a much smaller EC/soot contribution. These data were interpreted by considering the effects of oxy-combustion on flame attachment, ignition delay, and soot oxidation of a bituminous coal, and the effects of these processes on OC and EC emissions. Flame aerodynamics and inlet oxidant composition may influence emissions of organic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from a bituminous coal. During oxy-coal combustion, judicious control of inlet oxygen concentration and placement may be used to minimize organic HAP and soot emissions.",

     "abstract": "A detailed kinetic model consisting of homogeneous mechanism with 352 elementary reactions and a new heterogeneous mechanism on fly ash surface was developed to predict mercury oxidation in coal-fired flue gas with bromine addition. The heterogeneous mechanism involves the catalytic oxidation activity of unburned carbon (UBC) and Fe2O3 within fly ash, and includes 38 irreversible elementary reactions governing the adsorption, oxidation and desorption of mercury on fly ash. The competitive adsorption among flue gas compositions is also involved in the heterogeneous mechanism. Kinetic parameters of some homogeneous reactions in the Hg/Br and Hg/Cl sub-mechanisms have been updated based on the recent experimental data obtained by the improved aqueous chemistry methods. This kinetic model was validated by comparison to lab-, pilot- and full-scale experimental data. The comparison shows that the model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data. The rate of production analysis illustrates that the heterogeneous pathway is dominant for mercury oxidation in coal-fired flue gas with bromine addition. The sensitivity analysis and reaction path analysis indicate that the dominant pathway of heterogeneous mercury oxidation by bromine on fly ash surface is Hg0\u00a0\u2192\u00a0StHgBr(s)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0HgBr2, whereby a brominated carbon site partially oxidizes Hg0 into StHgBr(s) which is subsequently oxidized into HgBr2. NO and SO2 weakly inhibit mercury oxidation. H2O exhibits an inhibitory effect on heterogeneous Hg oxidation because of the elimination of brominated carbon sites.",

     "abstract": "Non-premixed oxy-fuel combustion of natural gas is used in industrial applications where high-intensity heat is required, such as glass manufacturing and metal forging and shaping. In these applications, the high flame temperatures achieved by oxy-fuel combustion increase radiative heat transfer to the surfaces of interest and soot formation within the flame is desired for further augmentation of radiation. However, the high cost of cryogenic air separation has limited the penetration of oxy-fuel combustion technologies. New approaches to air separation are being developed that may reduce oxygen production costs, but only for intermediate levels of oxygen enrichment of air. To determine the influence of oxygen enrichment on soot formation and radiation, we developed a non-premixed coannular burner in which oxygen concentrations and oxidizer flow rates can be independently varied, to distinguish the effects of turbulent mixing intensity from oxygen enrichment on soot formation and flame radiation. Local radiation intensities, soot concentrations, and soot temperatures have been measured using a thin-film thermopile, planar laser-induced incandescence (LII), and two-color imaging pyrometry, respectively. The measurements show that soot formation increases as the oxygen concentration decreases from 100% to 50%, helping to moderate a decrease in overall flame radiation. An increase in turbulence intensity has a marked effect on flame height, soot formation and thermal radiation, leading to decreases in all of these. The soot temperature decreases with a decrease in the oxygen concentration and increases with an increase in turbulent mixing intensity. Overall, the results suggest that properly designed oxygen-enriched burners that enhance soot formation for intermediate levels of oxygen purity may be able to achieve thermal radiation intensities as high as 85% of traditional oxy-fuel burners utilizing high-purity oxygen.",

Three bio-oil samples were studied, i.e., a raw bio-oil, a filtrated bio-oil (prepared from the raw bio-oil after fine char particles were removed via filtration), and the water-insoluble fraction of the filtrated bio-oil (blended with ethanol). The total inorganic species of the raw bio-oil are distributed dominantly (74.7%) in the water-soluble fraction but minorly in the water-insoluble fraction (10.4%) and suspended fine char particles (14.9%). The results from the combustion experiments show that the PSDs of PM10 from the complete combustion of the raw and filtrated bio-oils have a bimodal distribution, with a fine mode at \u223c0.03\u00a0\u00b5m and a coarse mode at \u223c2.0\u00a0\u00b5m. The water-insoluble fraction and the fine char particles suspended in the raw bio-oil have insignificant contributions to PM10 emission during the combustion of the raw bio-oil. It is the water-soluble fraction that plays a key role in the emission of PM10 during the combustion of the raw bio-oil. The data also show that PM10 emission during the complete combustion of bio-oil is insensitive to combustion atmosphere (air or oxyfuel) because complete bio-oil combustion is dominated by gaseous-phase reactions and the contribution of solid combustion is minimal. However, the excessive CO2 under oxyfuel conditions leads to more Fe being partitioned into PM0.1\u20131.",

     "abstract": "Oxygen carrier (OC) which is able to release and absorb O2 repeatedly is the key issue of chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU). Active component (typically, metal oxide) is usually supported by inert component to enhance the thermal stability and mechanical strength of OC particle. A clear understanding on the interactions of different phases (active material and support material) in OC particles could help rationalize the design of high-performance OC. In this work, periodical density functional theory (DFT) calculation, thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA), and isothermal decomposition experiments were jointly conducted to gain insight into the effects of different supports (TiO2, ZrO2, CuAl2O4 and MgAl2O4) on the Cu-based OC performance in terms of sintering resistance and decomposition reactivity. CuO nanocluster was positioned on support slab with periodical boundary condition to simulate the impregnation-derived OCs. First, the adsorption energies of CuO nanocluster on four supports, which can be used to assess the sintering resistance characteristics of the supports, were calculated via DFT. It was found that ZrO2 is most conducive to sintering resistance of OC particles, followed by CuAl2O4, MgAl2O4, and TiO2 (in that order). Then, the energy barriers of oxygen release process were examined to evaluate the effect of support on the OC decomposition reactivity. Results showed that the desorption of O2 molecule formed on the OC surface is the rate-determining step for all supported CuO. The O2 desorption energy barriers increases in the order of CuO/CuAl2O4\u00a0<\u00a0CuO/ZrO2\u00a0<\u00a0CuO/MgAl2O4\u00a0<\u00a0CuO/TiO2, showing CuAl2O4 as support is in best favor of CuO decomposition among four supports. The effects of support on OC performance were explained by the strong interactions between CuO nanocluster and support slab, resulting in significant electron redistribution and microstructure changes of CuO nanocluster. The microcosmic mechanism understandings to sintering resistance and decomposition reactivity were well supported by TMA and isothermal decomposition experiments, respectively.",

Individual pulse energies were measured by electrical probes, and the ignition time was quantified through the use of high-frame-rate intensified imaging of the chemiluminescence. For fixed inter-electrode gap and constant total energy, the ignition time was minimized at a certain pulsation frequency, with higher PRF being detrimental and resulting in longer ignition delay times. Decreasing the total energy deposited in the mixture shifted the minimum ignition time to higher PRF. On the contrary, increasing the gap distance at constant total energy allowed for the same minimum ignition time to be achieved at significantly lower PRF. The minimum ignition delay times for fixed inter-electrode gap distance were similar for a given amount of mean energy deposited per unit time. The effect of energy deposition, PRF, and inter-electrode gap was attributed to the competition between characteristic recirculation time from the discharge-induced flowfield and the inter-pulse time.",

To better understand how temperature and the presence of radicals affect nanosecond discharge ignitions, spatiotemporal profiles of rotational and vibrational N2(X) temperatures were measured through spontaneous Raman scattering in a lean propane\u2013air mixture and compared with previous results obtained in air to obtain the space- and time-resolved measurements necessary to validate the kinetic modeling of the discharge in presence of hydrocarbons. The study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the initial ignition processes in stoichiometric mixture (first observed at 1\u00a0\u00b5s) and the rapid displacement of the flame front in propane\u2013air mixtures. In the analyzed propane\u2013air mixture, the gas heated slightly more rapidly than in air. This temperature increase might have occurred in the release of energy resulting from dissociation of propane due to quenching by metastable species. The presence of traces of CO confirmed this assumption. The energy transfer processes were identical in all other respects and occurred over the same time scales in air and in the propane\u2013air mixture. Once the flame in the stoichiometric mixture was ignited, it propagated through a cylindrical channel whose diameter was identical to that of the volume of gas heated to above 900\u00a0K in the lean propane\u2013air mixture. This early ignition and the spreading of the flame kernel demonstrate the combined effect of radicals and temperature on the nanosecond discharge ignition process. The resulting new database makes it possible to validate simulations of the vibrational kinetics involved in nanosecond discharges of a lean propane\u2013air mixture and provides a first step toward modeling flame initiation.",

A detailed combustion mechanism and a plasma model, developed in our previous work, are used in the 3-D computations in order to study the impact of gas flow recirculation on the temporal evolution of species and gas temperature in the vicinity of the discharge zone. The results show that the formation of a fresh gas counterflow, with stagnation plane at the centre of the discharge and parallel to the electrodes, changes the topology of the hot kernel from an initial cylindrical shape to a toroidal one. This phenomenon leads to an increase of the area/volume ratio of the reactive kernel, that may result under certain conditions in kernel extinction. The results also show the importance of considering this 3-D gas flow recirculation to correctly predict the temporal evolution of the hot kernel. In particular, we show that the temperature and species concentrations in the central region of the discharge return to fresh gas conditions shortly after the end of the pulse.

Steady state sampling results suggest a linear trend of n-heptane dissociation and product species formation with increasing plasma frequency, with different major product species for oxidation and pyrolysis.

The plasma was generated by a spark discharge in engine-like conditions. Under these conditions, the dominant factors affecting the flame were stretching, heat transfer, and wall confinement effects. The spark was enhanced using microwaves, which accelerated the electrons in the spark, generating a non-thermal plasma. The flame size, flame speeds were computed from the visualized flame fronts. The experimental results indicated that an unsteady ignition kernel precedes the flame propagation and that there are multiple regimes prior to the final steady regime, in which the flame propagation is sustained. There is a minimum flame size which spark kernel must achieve, below which the flame could not sustain for successful combustion. The measured minimum flame size is a function of mixture equivalence ratio, and it decreases with increasing equivalence ratio. Increasing the microwave energy resulted in higher initial flame velocity and a reduction in the time taken to reach the critical flame size.

     "abstract": "Irradiating a flame by microwave radiation is one of several plasma-assisted combustion (PAC) technologies that can be used to modify the combustion chemical kinetics in order to improve flame-stability and to delay lean blow-out. One practical implication is that engines may be able to operate with leaner fuel mixtures and have an improved fuel flexibility capability including biofuels. In addition, this technology may assist in reducing thermoacoustic instabilities that may severely damage the engine and increase emission production. To examine microwave-assisted combustion a combined experimental and computational study of microwave-assisted combustion is performed for a lean, turbulent, swirl-stabilized, stratified flame at atmospheric conditions. The objectives are to demonstrate that the technology increases both the laminar and turbulent flame speeds, and modifies the chemical kinetics, enhancing the flame-stability at lean mixtures. The study combines experimental investigations using hydroxyl (OH) and formaldehyde (CH2O) Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and numerical simulations using finite rate chemistry Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The reaction mechanism is based on a methane (CH4)\u2013air skeletal mechanism expanded with sub-mechanisms for ozone, singlet oxygen, chemionization, electron impact dissociation, ionization and attachment. The experimental and computational results show similar trends, and are used to demonstrate and explain some significant aspects of microwave-enhanced combustion. Both simulation and experimental studies are performed close to lean blow off conditions. In the simulations, the flame is gradually subjected to increasing reduced electric field strengths, resulting in a wider flame that stabilizes nearer to the burner nozzle. Experiments are performed at two equivalence ratios, where the leaner case absorbs up to more than 5% of the total flame power. Data from experiments reveal trends similar to simulated results with increased microwave absorption.",

A new skeletal reaction mechanism was developed by incorporating the key reaction along with ozone chemistry to the skeletal iso-octane reaction mechanism from Ra and Reitz [19]. Reaction rate constants of the key reactions and five other related reactions were calibrated to match predictions from the comprehensive reaction mechanism from Curran et al. [Combust.

Increasing of the voltage pulse amplitude at the electrode resulted in a transition from no reactivity to induced cool flame and then to fast ignition. Sampling of the reacting mixture was performed at selected times during the experiments to draw mole fraction profiles of the fuel and major low temperature stable intermediates, showing a gradual increase in the mole fraction of these species after the discharge. Comparison with a spontaneous cool flame case at a slightly higher pressure shows that no new species are formed in the plasma-assisted case, and that after the initiation of reactivity by the discharge at the nanosecond timescale, the distribution and relative importance of the main reaction pathways is conserved at the millisecond timescale. Differences in the shape of the mole fraction and light emission profiles however suggest that the plasma-assisted cool flame is propagative.",

The experimental setup consists of an axisymmetric burner, with a nozzle made of a quartz tube. The equivalence ratio is 0.95, allowing stabilization of the flame in a V-shape or an M-shape geometry, over a central stainless steel rod. The plasma is produced by short pulses of 10-ns duration, 8-kV maximum voltage amplitude, applied at 10\u00a0kHz. The central rod is used as a cathode, while the anode is a stainless steel ring, fixed on the outer surface of the quartz tube. Plasma forcing is produced by positive or negative steps of plasma. The step response of the flame is investigated through heat release rate (HRR) fluctuations, to facilitate comparisons with flame response to acoustic perturbations. The chemiluminescence of CH* between two consecutive pulses was recorded using an intensified camera equipped with an optical filter to estimate the HRR fluctuations. First, the results show that the flame does not respond to each single plasma pulse, but is affected only by the average plasma power, confirming the step nature of the forcing. The temporal evolutions of HRR are analyzed and the flame transfer functions are determined. A forcing mechanism, as a local increase in the reactivity of the fluid close to the rod, is proposed and compared with numerical simulations.

An incipient ignition kernel, formed by localized energy deposition into a lean mixture of methane and air at atmospheric pressure, is subjected to sub-breakdown electric fields (E/N \u2248 100\u00a0Td) by a DC potential applied across the domain, resulting in non-thermal behavior of the plasma formed during the discharge. A two-fluid approach is employed to couple thermal neutrals and ions to the non-thermal electrons. A two-temperature plasma mechanism describing gas phase combustion, excitation of neutral species, and high-energy electron kinetics is employed to account for non-thermal effects. Charged species transported from the ignition zone drift rapidly through the domain, augmenting the magnitude of the electric field in the fresh gas during the pulse through a dynamic-electrode effect, which results in an increase in the energy of the electrons in the fresh mixture with increasing time. Enhanced fuel and oxidizer decomposition due to electron impact dissociation and interaction with excited neutrals generate a pool of radicals, mostly O and H, in the fresh gas ahead of the flame\u2019s preheat zone. In the configuration considered, the effect of the nanosecond pulse is to increase the mass of fuel burned at equivalent times relative to the unsupported ignition through enhanced radical generation, resulting in an increased heat release rate in the immediate aftermath of the pulse.",

The results suggest that the effectiveness of plasma discharges in promoting autoignition is very high at low temperatures.

We aimed to elucidate the origin of the occurrence of twin-lifted jet flames in laminar jet flow configurations, which occurred when AC electric fields were applied. The results indicated that a twin-lifted jet flame originated from cold jet instability, caused by interactions between negative ions in the jet flow via electron attachment as O2\u00a0+\u00a0e\u00a0\u2192\u00a0O2\u2013 when AC electric fields were applied. This was confirmed by conducting systematic, parametric experiment, which included changing gaseous component in jets and applying different polarity of direct current (DC) to the nozzle. Using two deflection plates installed in parallel with the jet stream, we found that only negative DC on the nozzle could charge oxygen molecules negatively. Meanwhile, the cold jet instability occurred only for oxygen-containing jets. A shedding frequency of jet stream due to AC driven instability showed a good correlation with applied AC frequency exhibiting a frequency doubling. However, for the applied AC frequencies over 80\u00a0Hz, the jet did not respond to the AC, indicating an existence of a minimum flow induction time in a dynamic response of negative ions to external AC fields. Detailed regime of the instability in terms of jet velocity, AC voltage and frequency was presented and discussed. Hypothesized mechanism to explain the instability was also proposed.",

The experimental setup consists of an axisymmetric burner with a nozzle made from a quartz tube. Three different flame geometries have been studied: conical, M-shaped and V-shaped flames. A central stainless steel rod is used as a cathode for the electric field and plasma excitations. The acoustic forcing is obtained with a loudspeaker located at the bottom part of the burner. For forcing by AC electric fields, a metallic grid is placed above the rod and connected to an AC power supply. Plasma forcing is obtained by applying high-voltage pulses of 10-ns duration applied at 10\u00a0kHz, between the rod and an annular stainless steel ring, placed at the outlet of the quartz tube. The chemiluminescence of CH* is used to determine the heat release rate fluctuations. For forcing by acoustic waves and plasma, the geometry of the flame plays a key role in the response of the combustion, while the flame shape does not affect the response of the combustion to electric field forcing. The flame response to acoustic forcing of about 10% of the incoming flow is similar to those obtained in the literature. The flames are found to be responsive to an AC electric field across the whole range of frequencies studied. A forcing mechanism, based on the generation of ionic wind, is proposed. The gain of the transfer function obtained for plasma forcing is found to be up to 5 times higher than for acoustic forcing. A possible mechanism of plasma forcing is introduced.",

DBD excites and dissociates some of the reactant molecules in the gas phase. These are more easily adsorbed on the catalyst surface than are ground-state species, therefore induction begins at a lower background temperature than in thermal catalysis. CO is adsorbed on copper sites, therefore CeZr/Ti is inactive in CO ignition, but CuZr/Ti and CuCeZr/Ti achieve DBD ignition at 34 and 44\u00a0s, respectively, at a specific energy density (SED) of 1500\u00a0J/L. CO catalytic ignition by DBD involves two steps. The induction process is dominated by plasma catalysis. At the same SEDs, induction with CuCeZr/Ti begins earlier than those with CuZr/Ti, in good agreement with the reducibilities and oxygen-transfer properties of these catalysts. The ignition process is governed by thermal catalysis because the enhancement of external diffusion induced by increasing the temperature improves the reaction rate. CuZr/Ti provided more CO adsorption sites than did CuCeZr/Ti, contributing to shortening of the ignition delay.",

     "abstract": "In this study, a comparison of flame base structures of hydrogen/methane\u2013air diffusion flames formed over a tiny-jet is made numerically for both isothermal and thermal conductive burner conditions, in order to clarify the fuel dependent flame stabilization mechanisms. It is found that, unlike a methane flame, the flame base of a hydrogen flame always attaches to the burner. The analyses indicate that the dominant intermediate-consumption steps have significantly lower activation energies for the hydrogen flame as compared to a methane flame. More importantly, one of the HO2 production reactions (R43f: H\u00a0+\u00a0O2\u00a0+\u00a0M\u00a0\u2192\u00a0HO2\u00a0+\u00a0M), which has a dominant role in sustaining reactivity at the flame base, shows a negative temperature dependence, causing the heat release rate in the flame base kernel to increase as the burner wall temperature decreases. With a thermal conductive burner (thermal conductivity of 16\u00a0W/m-K) over a wide range of fuel jet velocities (0.5\u20134.0\u00a0m/s), it is found that the burner tip is heated to a significantly higher temperature by a hydrogen flame due to its unique stabilization mechanism. The mixing effects of hydrogen and methane are then considered. It is found that the burner tip temperature can be reduced by adding methane into the fuel flow. This is because, according to the investigation of the structures of the hydrogen/methane jet diffusion flames, the reaction rate of R43f is suppressed due to the included intermediates (e.g., CH3, CH2O) consumption steps of methane. It is expected that the flame attachment feature associated with the flame base structure can be easily controlled by mixing hydrogen and methane, making it possible to control the burner tip temperature in advance.",

Three kinds of flame dynamics depending on inlet mean flow velocities, namely, normal flames in the high velocity regime, flames with repetitive extinction and ignition (FREI) in the intermediate velocity regime, and weak flames in the low velocity regime, which have also been observed for hydrocarbons in previous studies, were observed for ammonia by the direct observation with a digital still camera in this study. The existence of ammonia weak flames at 1270\u00a0K was confirmed. Special attention was paid to weak flames to examine ignition characteristics of an ammonia/air mixture at low temperature because ignition experiments of ammonia have been conducted only at very high temperatures (around 2000\u00a0K). Species measurement for a stoichiometric ammonia/air weak flame at 10\u00a0cm/s was made using and a mass spectrometer and a T-shaped reactor fused with a micro-probe. The present species measurement elucidated the structure of the ammonia/air weak flame and complete combustion was confirmed at 1290\u00a0K. Five reaction mechanisms were used for computations of weak flames and the four of them did not predict complete combustion within the given computational domain. One reaction mechanism predicted complete combustion but the weak flame position in computation was located in a temperature region lower than that in the experiment. The order of reactivity evaluations among the five mechanisms using weak flames in the micro flow reactor agreed with that using ignition delay times at low temperatures which are generally difficult to be taken by ignition experiments. The capability of weak flame methodology to validate ignition properties of reaction mechanisms for low reactivity fuels like ammonia was successfully demonstrated in this study.",

Comparisons between CH4/O2/Xe and CH4/O2/N2 flame locations indicated that CH4/O2/Xe mixtures have a higher reactivity than CH4/O2/N2 flames both experimentally and computationally. Furthermore, both experimental and computational results indicated that lower dilution and lower equivalence ratios increase reactivity.

Comparison between CH4/O2/Xe and CH4/O2/N2 flame structures indicated that observable differences are seen between 1000 and 1100\u00a0K.

The methane jet is injected in a volume of homogeneous and isotropic air turbulence without mean flow, with the level of turbulence being controlled independently.

The results show that the position of the maximum intensity of flame emission was randomly scattered due to the fact that the ignited flame is deflected from the nozzle axis by the turbulent velocity fluctuations. The effect is more profound at higher Rejet. The value of the MIE, determined according to 50% ignitibility of mixture, increases by a factor of 2 for an increase of Re\u03bb from 0 to 207 and by a factor of 5 for an increase of Rejet from 1000 to 3000. Two trends are observed on MIE with Re\u03bb. For low Re\u03bb, MIE is independent of Re\u03bb. Past a critical value of Re\u03bb, MIE increases as a linear function of Re\u03bb. This transition occurs at critical values of Re\u03bb,c = 158, 197 and 202 for Rejet= 1000, 2000 and 3000, respectively.

     "abstract": "Experimental results focusing on understanding the role of autoignition in the stabilisation of turbulent lifted jet flames of dimethyl ether issuing into a hot vitiated coflow are explored in this paper. A stability map of the flame lift-off height as a function of coflow temperature and jet partially premixing ratios is reported, indicating a strong sensitivity of the mean and rms lift-off heights to the coflow temperature. A new experimental setup that utilises high repetition rate (10\u00a0kHz) joint OH and CH2O PLIF combined with a third camera to track out of plane motion via chemiluminescence emission is employed. This allows the temporal dynamics of the flame base and autoignition kernels to be tracked at high spatial resolution over a spatial window of 20\u00a0mm (height) \u00d7 43\u00a0mm (width). To capture the temporal statistics of the flame over the full lift-off height range, a complementary, but not simultaneous, large field of view high-speed chemiluminescence imaging experiment was employed. The use of high-speed diagnostics is shown to be invaluable to understand the temporal dynamics of the flame base region, such as identifying and tracking autoignition kernels ahead of, and merging with, the main flame base. For low coflow temperatures, autoignition kernels are found to be fundamentally important to the stabilisation of the flame: small autoignition initiated kernels rapidly grow to form large flame kernels that eventually merge with the main flame base and in doing so rapidly establish a new lift-off height significantly upstream of the original flame base. For high coflow temperatures, autoignition kernels whilst still present, are significantly smaller in mean size and play a reduced role in the overall flame stabilisation. This leads to the conclusion that partially premixed flame propagation plays an increased role in overall flame stabilisation for high coflow temperature flames.",

Budget analysis of individual terms in the CMC equation for the hydroxyl mass fraction shows that conditional convection in the CMC model has a significant role in inducing both local extinction and re-ignition events. The conditional dilatation flux contributes only when the local heat release rate is significant.",

     "abstract": "Turbulent fluctuations of the scalar dissipation rate have a major impact on extinction in non-premixed combustion. Recently, an unsteady extinction criterion has been developed (Hewson, 2013) that predicts extinction dependent on the duration and the magnitude of dissipation rate fluctuations exceeding a critical quenching value; this quantity is referred to as the dissipation impulse. The magnitude of the dissipation impulse corresponding to unsteady extinction is related to the difficulty with which a flamelet is exintguished, based on the steady-state S-curve.In this paper we evaluate this new extinction criterion for more realistic dissipation rates by evolving a stochastic Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process for the dissipation rate. A comparison between unsteady flamelet evolution using this dissipation rate and the extinction criterion exhibit good agreement. The rate of predicted extinction is examined over a range of Damk\u00f6hler and Reynolds numbers and over a range of the extinction difficulty. The results suggest that the rate of extinction is proportional to the average dissipation rate and the area under the dissipation rate probability density function exceeding the steady-state quenching value. It is also inversely related to the actual probability that this steady-state quenching dissipation rate is observed and the difficulty of extinction associated with the distance between the upper and middle branches of the S-curve.",

     "abstract": "Local extinction and reignition is studied in a direct numerical simulation (DNS) dataset of a turbulent lifted flame [1]. Extinction holes are identified as regions on the stoichiometric surface which have a product mass fraction less than a critical value. Using this criterion, thirty individual holes are identified and tracked in time. It is observed that large outwardly pushing structures caused compressive strain rates normal to the mixture-fraction iso-surface. These high strain rates caused high dissipation rates and the initiation of the extinction process, leading to the initial creation of holes. Extinction, i.e. hole growth, then occurs in two phases. In the first phase, the edge-propagation velocity is initially negative and the fluid dynamic tangential strain rate on the hole surface is positive, leading to rapid hole growth. Subsequently, in the second phase, local compressive strain rates at the flame edge relax, and the edge-flame propagation velocity switches to positive. However, in this second phase, the hole continues to expand because of positive tangential strain rate on the hole\u2019s surface, which dominates over the healing effect of positive edge-flame propagation velocities. When reignition starts, the edge-propagation velocity is mainly affected by the product-mass fraction displacement speed and shows a dependency on curvature and scalar dissipation rate, similar to what is expected in edge-flame propagation. An analysis of thermal diffusion on the unburned portion of the mixture-fraction iso-surface shows that the edge-flame propagation mechanism dominates turbulent engulfment during reignition in this study.",

Proper parameterization and a regime diagram are introduced to characterize the pilot stabilized flames covering non-premixed, partially premixed, and premixed flames.

Measurements were conducted using simultaneously recorded planar Rayleigh scattering and OH-LIF signals. Due to the significant variation of the effective Rayleigh cross section in mixture fraction space and the unknown OH quenching contributions, a comparison of derived quantities such as temperature and OH mole fraction is not possible. Therefore, the Rayleigh and OH-LIF signals were incorporated in the LES flamelet/progress variable approach used here. This allows for a direct comparison of experimentally recorded and numerically predicted Rayleigh and OH-PLIF signals for the flame structure analysis, which includes the joint PDF of both quantities. The two flames are compared in terms of the local flame structure. In addition, differences in the mixing field and especially in the location of turbulent/non-turbulent interface are investigated.",

The aim of this study is to investigate dual-fuel flame structure and stability and provide experimental data for model validation. Imaging results show an inner flame branch along the hollow-cone spray and an outer flame branch at the shear layer between the annular oxidiser and an inner recirculation zone over the bluff body. As the CH4 equivalence ratio in the annular channel increases, \u03d5pmx, the probability of flame lift-off at the outer branch increases. A premixed flame at the same flow conditions is stably attached, implying a detrimental competition of the two fuels for the locally-available O2 leading to extinction. If the oxidiser contains CH4 such that \u03d5pmx is above the lean flammability limit (LFL), OH in the inner recirculation zone appears in wide fronts, contrasting the thin regions visible in the spray flame. If CH4 is mixed with air at a \u03d5pmx below the LFL, laminar flame simulations show the consumption of CH4 due to the high temperature of the C2H5OH reaction zone and an extinction strain rate that decreases initially with increasing the \u03d5pmx, but increases again as \u03d5pmx approaches the LFL.

This study examines how equivalence ratio stratification affects the physics of turbulent flame propagation using Direct Numerical Simulation. Three-dimensional simulations of a turbulent slot-Bunsen flame configuration are performed with accurate multi-step kinetic modelling for methane\u2013air combustion. We compare one perfectly-premixed and three equivalence ratio-stratified cases with the mean equivalence ratio gradient aligned with, tangential to or opposed to the mean flame brush. The simulation results are analysed in terms of flame surface area and the burning intensity. The local effects of stratification are then investigated further by examining statistics of the displacement speed conditioned on the flame-normal equivalence ratio gradient. The local burning intensity is found to depend on the orientation of the stratification with respect to the flame front, so that burning intensity is enhanced when the flame speed in the products is faster than in the reactants. This effect of alignment between equivalence ratio gradients and flame fronts has been observed previously in laminar flames and it is found here that it also affects the global behaviour of turbulent flames. The flame surface area is also influenced by equivalence ratio stratification and this may be explained by differences in the surface-averaged consumption rate and differential propagation effects due to flame speed variations associated with equivalence ratio fluctuations.",

They complement earlier measurements with coarser resolution. The burner stabilising these flames enables variability in the mixture fraction profile at the exit plane. Earlier studies have shown enhanced stability at an optimal compositional inlet profile that leads to multiple modes of combustion, with premixed-stratified flames close to the jet exit but transitioning to diffusion-dominated burning downstream. It is found that at upstream locations, for jets with homogeneous inlets as well as for the high-temperature regions of flames with inhomogeneous inlets, both fine and coarse measurements of scalar dissipation rates yield similar results, giving confidence that measurements resolve the local dissipation scales. Downstream locations in homogeneous mixtures also show similar results for both coarse and fine measurements across all mixtures. Differences arise in the rich, inner regions of turbulent flames with inhomogeneous inlets, where the fine resolution measurements are more reliable due to the existence of steep gradients in composition. Both data sets provide a comprehensive platform to enhance the modelling of turbulent flames in the presence of multi-modes of combustion.",

     "abstract": "Recent experimental studies of a piloted turbulent jet burner at Sydney and Sandia with inhomogeneous mixture composition at the inlet have revealed that the flame stability of a partially premixed flame can be significantly increased with a tailored mixture fraction profile at the burner exit. In the present work, large-eddy simulations of this burner are performed with three different levels of mixture inhomogeneity. A multi-regime flamelet model is employed, which accounts for the range of combustion modes found in these flames. The results of the simulations are validated against experimental data for the case with the highest blowoff velocity. Good agreement is observed for velocity, mixture fraction, and temperature fields. The simulations with the multi-regime model provide detailed data of the prevalent combustion regime as well as the heat release. The location of heat release and differences in the combustion modes are analyzed for three cases with different mixture inhomogeneities. The progress variable source term is split up into the individual contributions of the combustion regimes. Substantial differences are found for the contributions of premixed and non-premixed combustion in the different flames as well as the location of the heat release. These results are used to explain the respective flame stabilities. For the inhomogeneous case, which features substantially increased flame stability, hot pilot gases are in contact with reactive mixture directly at the nozzle. Therefore a predominantly premixed zone of strong heat release develops at the jet exit and stabilizes the flame. For both other cases, the heat release at the nozzle is lower leading to smaller blowoff velocities. For the non-premixed case, this is due to air shielding the pilot from the reactive mixture. For the premixed case, the homogeneous mixture issuing from the jet is above the flammability limit and consequently the heat release is diffusion dominated.",

The combustion model is sparse-Lagrangian multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) coupled with large eddy simulation (LES). This is a first attempt using MMC-LES to model flows where multi-modes of combustion may occur. The studied burner has two concentric tubes surrounded by an annular pilot. The central tube carrying methane can slide within the outer air tube to induce compositional inhomogeneity at the burner exit plane. This leads to enhanced flame stability at some optimal inner fuel tube recess distance. For comparison purposes, model results are presented firstly for a case with compositional homogeneity at the inlet plane and secondly for the inhomogeneous case. The MMC-LES model shows a very good agreement with the experiment for the homogeneous-inlet case where the prevalence of non-premixed combustion is observed. The inhomogeneous-inlet case features a transition from a premixed flame structure close to the burner to a diffusion flame further downstream. It represents an extreme test of the chosen MMC model which incorporates the enforcement of mixing locally in an extended space comprised of the LES reference mixture fraction and physical location. The computed results show a fair agreement with the data close to the nozzle; closely approaching but not quite achieving the premixed structure. The return to a broad, distributed diffusion flame away from the nozzle is, however, captured very well.",

The first mixture fraction (Z) characterizes the mixing between the methane/air mixture issuing from the burner and the surrounding coflow air. The second mixture fraction (Z*) tracks mixing of methane and air without regard to the point of origin of the air. Additionally, a fuel premixing fraction (F) has been defined that corresponds to the fuel side boundary condition for the solution of the 1D flamelet equations in terms of the first mixture fraction. Two methods of characterizing the thermochemical state are considered, one using Z and Z* and the other using Z and F. Comparison of temperature and species predictions with experimental data shows that the structure of the flame with inhomogeneous inlets cannot be predicted by a single mixture fraction model while this is successfully achieved with the two mixture fraction models.

The burner is identical to that used earlier by the Sydney Group and employs two concentric tubes within the pilot stream. The inner tube, carrying fuel, can be recessed, leading to a varying degree of inhomogeneity in mixing with the outer air stream. Three fuels are tested: dimethyl ether (DME), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and compressed natural gas (CNG). It is found that improvement in flame stability at the optimal compositional inhomogeneity is highest for CNG and lowest for DME. Three possible reasons for this different enhancement in stability are investigated: mixing patterns, pilot effects, and fuel chemistry. Numerical simulations realized in the injection tube highlight similarities and differences in the mixing patterns for all three fuels and demonstrate that mixing cannot explain the different stability gains. Changing the heat release rates from the pilot affects the three fuels in similar ways and this also implies that the pilot stream is unlikely to be responsible for the observed differences. Fuel reactivity is identified as a key factor in enhancing stability at some optimal compositional inhomogeneity. This is confirmed by inference from joint images of PLIF-OH and PLIF-CH2O, collected at a repetition rate of 10\u00a0kHz in turbulent flames of DME, and from one-dimensional calculations of laminar flames using detailed chemistry for DME, CNG, and LPG.",

Voltage and current waveforms of spark discharges with nearly square profiles are carefully generated for accurate determination of MIE, commonly defined as the 50% successful ignitability. Applying high-speed schlieren imaging, we observe a drastic change of kernel development from turbulent flamelet to distributed like with island formation and local quench even at 5 atm, when u\u2032/SL is greater than some critical values depending on p. It is found that the scaling slopes of MIET/MIEL versus u\u2032/SL change abruptly from a linear increase to an exponential increase when u\u2032/SL > (u\u2032/SL)c, showing ignition transition.

The mechanism of kernel extinction is investigated by tracking lifetime trajectories of flame particles on an O2 mass fraction isosurface in the flame speed-curvature (Sd, \u03ba) space using the well-known concept of minimum radius from laminar flames. The classical S-curve in the temperature-Damk\u00f6hler number (T, Da) space is also analyzed.

Turbulence locally wrinkles the isosurface into positively curved structures which lead to turning points in (Sd, \u03ba) space, such that the minimum radius is never reached, locally and as an ensemble. A budget analysis of the principal curvature evolution equation highlights the role of turbulence in bending the surface to form positively curved, pointed structures where heat loss is enhanced, further lowering Da towards extinction.",

The present work extends burning velocity measurements to much higher levels of turbulence than have been considered before: to extreme turbulence defined as u\u2019\u2044SL values from 25 to 163 and Lx\u2044\u03b4L up to 114. These conditions are argued to be more representative of the turbulence found in certain engines. To do so, a new large, piloted Bunsen burner (called Hi-Pilot) was developed and OH and formaldehyde PLIF images provided the time-averaged contours of progress variable based on OH (cOH). The conventional global consumption speed (ST,GC,1\u2044SL) is based on the cOH = 0.5 contour and it was found to exceed 25. Two other measured speeds are based on the leading edge (ST,GC,2) and the component due to flamelet surface density (ST,F). Varying the integral scale had a significant effect on ST,GC,2 but not on the other two burning velocities. The consumption speed ST,GC,1 curve displayed \u201cbending\u201d in the range of extreme turbulence, while the flamelet surface density contribution (ST,F) curve instead flattened out and was independent of turbulence intensity. A possible explanation for these measured trends is based on the observed extensive broadening of the preheat zone. Preheat broadening depends on the integral scale and is believed to attenuate the turbulence that eventually interacts with the reaction zone. Results indicate a breakdown of the laminar flamelet assumption; it appears that preheat broadening may cause thermal diffusivity to dominate over the flame wrinkling mechanism.",

Layer thicknesses were determined from planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) images of OH and formaldehyde. Preheat layer thickness was found to increase to sixteen times the laminar value. Residence time of eddies in the flame appears to be important, since the flame tip had preheat regions that were thicker than at the flame base. Reaction layers were not broadened, remaining below twice the laminar value. Four of the cases were predicted to lie in the Broadened Preheat - Thin Reaction layer (BP-TR) regime and the measurements confirmed that they had a BP-TR structure. However, two cases went far beyond the predicted boundary for the Broken Reactions (BR) regime but measurements showed that they were not broken but retained their BP-TR structure. Thus the regime of BP-TR is measured to persist over a wider range than previously predicted. One explanation is that the turbulent eddies may become weakened by the thick, viscous preheat layer before they arrive at the reaction front.

Two reaction rate metrics are presented, which are based on tracking fluid elements in a Lagrangian manner as they traverse from the flame leading edge to the reaction zone. This yields both a fluid residence time in the flame (\u03c4c) and a metric of the flame speed (S). \u03c4c in the thickened preheat zone regime was reduced by nearly 40% compared with the corrugated flamelet despite the flame being broader, indicating a substantial increase in the local reaction rate. The joint PDFs of S and local flame thickness showed a positive linear correlation between these quantities, which can be explained by turbulent diffusivity arguments. These data provide guidelines for reaction rate models, as well as a quantitative means of comparing local behavior between experiments and simulations.",

By scrutinizing the literature, it was found that, although inferred from exactly similar numerical simulations, existing parametric expressions for the efficiency function (the ratio of the flame stretch to vortex strain) do not agree in the way the latter should behave when the ratio of the vortex rotational velocity U\u03b8 to the laminar flame speed SL is increased. These expressions also appear to be unequally accurate when compared to experimental data and do not feature the non monotonic evolution of the efficiency function with U\u03b8/SL which is observed in both experimental data and numerical simulations of a \u2018isothermal\u2019 propagating interface. In addition, whilst previous studies have focused only on the impact of U\u03b8/SL and Rv/\u03b4L (Rv being the vortex typical size and \u03b4L the laminar flame thickness) our study reveals the importance of other parameters, the most important of which being the residence time of the vortex associated with its convection velocity.

In an accompanying experiment high speed particle image velocimetry at 5\u00a0kHz was used to obtain the time resolved velocity field and evaluate flame surface density, brush thickness and probability density functions of curvature and strain rates conditioned on the flame front. The low turbulence intensity flame featured wrinkling and mostly symmetric flame structures with thin regions of heat release along the flame front. For moderate turbulence intensity (14%), pronounced formation of cusps and unburnt mixture fingers was observed with continuous heat release regions. However, the local flame structure was observed to be strongly altered for the 30% turbulence intensity. Localized extinction occurred along the flame surface creating isolated pockets of OH with heat release occurring along the boundary. Pockets of preheated reactants along with fresh reactants were observed inside the flame envelope. The overall flame appearance was observed to intermittently switch from varicose (symmetric) to sinuous (asymmetric) type (vortex shedding mode). The curvature and strain rates pdfs broadened with increasing levels of turbulence intensity. The flame brush thickness showed an initial increase with increasing turbulence levels but saturated beyond 24% turbulence intensity.

     "abstract": "This study investigated the flashback phenomenon coupled with self-excited combustion instability in turbulent premixed bluff-body flames using the pressure fluctuation measurement, high-speed OH-PLIF, and PIV techniques. Previous studies investigating flashback in a bluff-body have found that the flame moves back and forth around the trailing edge of the bluff-body; however, the phenomenon in which the flame propagates beyond the bluff-body has not been sufficiently studied. Therefore, this study focused on understanding a strong flashback, which can damage the upper section of a combustor and which is vulnerable to heat due to flame propagation over the front of the bluff-body.The combustion instability frequency resulting from changes in the combustion length occurred within the range of the resonance frequency of the combustor, thereby confirming that thermal-acoustic combustion instability occurred in the combustor. When the strong flashback occurs, an instantaneous adverse pressure gradient is formed within a combustion instability cycle. Consequently, the generated reverse flow pushed the flame attached at the trailing edge of the bluff-body to the upstream from the bluff-body. The flame propagated rapidly along the side of the bluff-body by the influence of the boundary layer flow and the decreased quenching distance. This propagated flame became the ignition source at the front tip of the bluff-body and generated the flame surface that propagated in all directions; thus, it was found to be the primary cause of the increase in the flashback distance. The flame flashback distance also varied depending on the combustor length and the initial flow condition. An attempt was made to concentrate the measured data of flashback distance under various conditions into a single line, and turbulence intensity and combustion instability frequency were the dominant factors that impacted the flashback distance.",

A picosecond laser, 80\u00a0ps@266\u00a0nm is used to measure scattering and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) in selected UV and visible bands while Laser-induced incandescence (LII) is excited using a pulsed laser with 8\u00a0ns@1064\u00a0nm. Fast photomultiplier tubes are used to ensure time-resolved measurements and LIF decay times of the order of 3.5\u00a0ns are detected. The LIF signals are attributed to nanoparticles or condensed phase species made up of PAHs, whereas LII was correlated with soot. Data conditioning based on the noise level was made to delineate the potentially large influence of intermittency on the statistics of the detected signals. It was found that LIF signals with long decay times were detected well before the onset of soot particles, as seen by LII, and these continue well into the maximum soot formation region. The correlation between the LII and LIF signals confirmed the co-presence of small nanoparticles together with high concentrations of mature soot. Analysis of conditioned mean soot concentration suggests that the intermittency occurring at the edge and tip of the flame does not locally decrease the soot concentration since large LII signals were still detected. These simultaneous, time-resolved measurements are extremely useful to provide insights on the evolution of combustion-generated particles in turbulent sooting flames.",

Simulations are compared against well-characterized boundary conditions, well-resolved two-dimensional velocity fields from particle image velocimetry, and line-of-sight CH\u204e profiles. Experimental results indicate that small amounts of heat losses may play a significant role on the jet reactivity as the flame heights scale with the heat loss from the jet. However, differences between flames with different fuels can still be seen in the absence of heat losses and these differences are magnified at higher Reynolds numbers. Particularly, methane flames are consistently taller and ethylene flames consistently shorter while other fuels present approximately the same flame height.

Tomographic PIV provides three-dimensional velocity measurements, from which the complete strain rate tensor is determined. The OH LIF measurements are used to determine the position of the flame surface and the flame-normal orientation within the imaging plane. This combination of diagnostic techniques enables quantification of divergence as well as flame-normal and tangential strain rates, which are otherwise biased using only planar measurements. Measurements are compared in three lean-to-stoichiometric flames that have different amounts of heat release and Damk\u00f6hler numbers greater than unity. The effects of heat release on the principal strain rates and their alignment relative to the local flame normal are analyzed. The extensive strain rate preferentially aligns with the flame normal in the reaction zone, which has been indicated by previous studies. The strength of this alignment increases with increasing heat release and, as a result, the flame-normal strain rate becomes highly extensive. These effects are associated with the gas expansion normal to the flame surface, which is largest for the stoichiometric flame. In the preheat zone, the compressive strain rate has a tendency to align with the flame normal. Away from the flame front, the flame \u2013 strain rate alignment is arbitrary in both the reactants and products. The flame-tangential strain rate is on average positive across the flame front, and therefore the turbulent strain rate field contributes to the enhancement of scalar gradients as in passive scalar turbulence. Although increases in heat release result in larger positive values of the divergence as well as flame-normal and tangential strain rates, the tangential strain rate has a weaker dependence on heat release than the flame-normal strain rate and the divergence.",

     "abstract": "Transport equations for reaction rate W and its Favre-averaged value W \u02dc are derived from first principle in the case of premixed turbulent combustion. The assumptions made for derivation hold for unity Lewis number premixed flames at least in the flamelet regime of turbulent burning. Analysis of the latter equation shows that it involves two dominant terms, but the difference between them vanishes if reaction zones retain the structure of the zone in the unperturbed laminar flame. However, in such a case, turbulent burning velocity cannot grow with time during interaction of an initially laminar flame with a turbulent flow. Therefore, the analysis indicates a vital role played by local perturbations of reaction zone structure in premixed turbulent combustion. The dominance of these two terms and the important role played by the difference between them are confirmed by analyzing three DNS databases associated with both the corrugated flamelets and thin reaction zones regimes of premixed turbulent burning. Moreover, the DNS data show that perturbations of local displacement speed due to perturbations of local flamelet structure are also of paramount importance for modeling transport of flame surface density even in weakly turbulent flows. Finally, by simulating curved and/or strained laminar premixed flames and integrating the transport equation for W across the flames, the integral is shown to depend linearly on the stretch rate even in highly perturbed flames, with results obtained from variously stretched flames being close to each other. Based on this finding, the difference between the two dominant terms in the transport equation for the mean rate W \u02dc is hypothesized to depend linearly on the stretch rate conditioned to the reaction zone. Application of this hypothesis to the DNS data associated with the corrugated flamelets combustion regime yields encouraging results, thus, confirming a crucial role played by local perturbations of reaction zone structure even in weakly turbulent flames.",

     "abstract": "In turbulent premixed flames, much experimental evidence points to a strong influence of pre-mixture turbulence intensity on the turbulent burning velocity. The linear enhancement of turbulent burning velocity in low-intensity turbulence is predicted accurately by current models. In contrast, the deviation from linearity in high-intensity turbulence, known as the \u201cbending effect,\u201d remains to be explained. The present work has employed Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) to investigate the bending effect. An initially laminar methane-air premixed flame was subjected to increasing levels of turbulence across five different simulations which maintained all parameters except the turbulence intensity constant. The bending effect was captured within these simulations. Subsequently, plausible explanations were investigated using the framework of the Flame Surface Density (FSD) approach. From the ensuing analysis, it is evident that flame surface area reflects distinctly the variation of turbulent burning velocity with turbulence intensity. Local flame quenching does not appear to be the primary mechanism behind the bending effect. Instead, the observed bending effect results from a shift in balance, under high-intensity turbulence, towards mechanisms that favour destruction of flame surface area. These mechanisms tend to preserve the reaction layer and, thereby, ensure the validity of Damk\u00f6hler\u2019s hypothesis and flamelet models in conditions that cause the bending effect that is observed here to occur.",

Simultaneous Mie scattering, OH-PLIF and PIV allowed the delineation of five separate fluid states (reactants, combustion products, mixing fluid, mildly and strongly reacting fluids) with associated material surfaces. The analysis shows self-sustained flames in low strain regions with a collocated flow acceleration for higher Damk\u00f6hler numbers. By contrast, in highly strained regions (e.g. beyond the twin flame extinction point) the burning mode is governed by the counter-flowing hot combustion products resulting in increased levels of vorticity and an absence of a preferential dilatation direction. The current analysis provides novel insights into combustion regime transitions by means of (i) strain rate statistics conditioned upon material surfaces and (ii) the evolution of fluid state interface probabilities as a function of the Damk\u00f6hler number.

     "abstract": "We investigate extinction/reignition events in two contrasting turbulent premixed flames of the Yale turbulent counterflow flame (TCF) burner, that are both qualitatively and quantitatively different. One of the two chosen flames is a high-burning (HB) flame with a low probability of local extinction while the other flame is a low-burning (LB) flame with a high probability of local extinction. In recent work, we successfully studied the turbulent premixed flames of the Yale TCF burner using the large-eddy simulation/probability density function (LES/PDF) methods. In this present study, the main motivation is to investigate how the compositional structure of the two turbulent flames are related to that of laminar flames. To this end, steady, one-dimensional, strained, opposed-jet laminar flame calculations are performed to investigate the effect of strain rates K on the laminar counterparts of HB and LB, and to evaluate the extinction strain rates Sext for the two flames. Subsequently, a normalized distance Z is defined in terms of the mixture fraction \u03be, which is calculated based on the mass fraction of N2. The scatter plots from the particle data of (a) CH2O mass fraction Y CH 2 O * vs. progress variable p* and (b) temperature T* vs. the normalized distance Z* are quite different for the two flames with more samples close to the extinguished laminar profile for the LB flame than for the HB flame. The cell-mean profiles of T vs. Z resemble the laminar profiles at different strain rates even though the LES/PDF are non-trivially 3D and unsteady. These cell-mean profiles are used to evaluate the instantaneous equivalent steady strain rate (ESSR) S for the two flames. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of S, conditional on S < Sext (i.e., burning samples), is somewhat similar, with the distributions being broad without a peak close to the bulk strain rate. However, comparatively, more samples of the LB flame have the ESSR values above the extinction strain rate, i.e., S > Sext. The scatter plots of the ESSR S vs. the fresh product layer thickness \u0394f quantify the thinning of the product layer as the strain rate S increases. The scatter for the HB flame follow the corresponding laminar profile quite closely, whereas, the thicknesses observed for the LB flame are higher compared to its laminar prediction.",

Spatially highly resolved major species concentrations and temperature are measured by 1D Raman\u2013Rayleigh. Temperature gradients from line data are corrected to the flame front normal by the means of Crossed Planar Rayleigh Imaging. A conditioning based on multiple criteria relevant for stratified combustion is applied to the large dataset and allows to analyze the impact of stratification on the flame structure. Conditioning criteria are the local equivalence ratio (\u03d5\u00a0=\u00a00.75), the local thermal progress variable (c\u00a0=\u00a00.54), the stratification level (instantaneous flame-normal gradient in equivalence ratio), and a temperature difference over the 1D probe volume, ensuring the flame front is included. Conditionally averaged quantities such as temperature profiles in the flame-normal coordinate system, equivalence ratio, H2 mass fractions, and temperature gradients are parameterized on the local equivalence ratio gradient in order to understand the impact of stratification on the flame structure. The temperature profiles in this back-supported configuration are more affected on the reactant side than on the product side by stratification. In contrast to that, equivalence ratios as well as mass fractions of hydrogen are found to be sensitive to stratification on the product side as well as in the reactants. Profiles are altered even in the reaction zone by enhancing the equivalence ratio gradients, which is in contrast to results obtained in the Cambridge/Sandia configuration. This finding indicates the influence of turbulence on stratified combustion in the thin-reaction-zone regime, as characterized for instance by the difference in Karlowitz and Damk\u00f6hler numbers for the Darmstadt versus the Cambridge/Sandia configuration.",

Swirl creates enhanced turbulence as well as outer flow entrainment, and disrupts the pre-flame zone significantly, whilst the high temperature reaction zone as marked by OH remains relatively intact. In particular, the temperature at the location of maximum OH gradient shows very low variance across the flame region.The 2D image analysis of OH and temperature shows that the corresponding 2D gradients are aligned up to a distance of half the laminar flame thickness away from the flame front, deviating significantly in the case of swirling flames beyond that region. As in previous investigations in diffusion flames, the mean width of the observed thermal structures increases from 300 to 600 \u00b5m near the flame, with a main mode around the laminar flame thermal width in the unswirled case. The correlation between 2D thermal dissipation and variance of the reaction progress variable extracted from the images shows a direct proportionality, with a slope which agrees well with theory in the region of high turbulence away from the base. At the base of the flame where turbulence is low, the local scalar dissipation becomes a function of the local temperature via the thermal diffusivity.",

     "abstract": "Multi-scale interactions and kinetic-energy transfer between turbulence and flames are fundamental to understanding and modeling premixed turbulent reacting flows. In order to investigate these phenomena, direct numerical simulations of a turbulent premixed flame are analyzed in this study. The results reveal a flux of kinetic energy that involves a cross-scale transfer through the turbulence cascade and whose prevailing direction in the flame brush is from subgrid to resolved scales. The root cause of this reversal in energy transfer, termed subgrid-scale (SGS) backscatter, is the effect of thermal expansion in the subgrid scales, by which small amounts of enthalpy created by combustion heat release are transformed into small-scale kinetic energy by means of the SGS pressure-gradient velocity correlation. The resulting overload of SGS kinetic energy is transferred to the resolved scales through SGS backscatter. This cross-scale flux of energy, along with a larger one that relies on large-scale quantities only and does not involve the energy cascade, describes the transformation of combustion heat release into kinetic energy in the turbulent premixed flame. Based on scaling analyses, it is theorized that the contribution of the cross-scale flux to the total kinetic-energy augmentation vanishes in combustion regimes in which the flame-transit time is too short to allow for activation of the non-linear convective mechanisms of the energy cascade.",

Formaldehyde and OH distributions are compared with PLIF measurements and excellent agreement is reported supporting previous experimental observations: for flame A1, OH is seen throughout the recirculation zone while CH2O is present only close to the shear layer along which heat release occurs in a thin, unbroken region of CH2O/OH overlap, disturbed only occasionally by vortex-like structures. For flame A4 close to blow-off, the calculation generally shows appreciable quantities of CH2O throughout the recirculation zone with isolated pockets of OH, surrounded by high heat release, in agreement with experimental findings. The simulation further evidences that in regions experimentally void of both CH2O and OH, large quantities of partially reacted fluid are present which entered the recirculation zone from the top. Quantitative comparisons of flame surface density and local flame curvature statistics are also calculated which agree well with experimental data, suggesting a comprehensive description of the physico-chemical processes of the proposed modelling strategy.",

The DNS provides initial conditions and time varying input quantities, including the mean velocity, turbulent diffusion coefficient, and scalar mixing rate for the TPDF simulations. A number of progress variable definitions are explored, as well as the commonly used constant mechanical-to-scalar mixing timescale model. It is found that the EMST model provides the best prediction of the flame structure and flame propagation speed out of the models tested. The IEM model implies a qualitatively incorrect conditional mean and RMS diffusion rate, while the MC model can qualitatively capture the conditional mean diffusion rate. Only the EMST model can accurately predict the conditional mean diffusion rate for this flame, which can be attributed to its enforcement of mixing that is local in composition space. Finally, a parametric study on the mechanical-to-scalar timescale ratio is performed. It is found that the optimal choice for the timescale ratio varies by a factor of 2 for the two DNS cases study, despite the cases having the same configuration. Therefore, this commonly used approach does not appear to be viable for turbulent premixed flames and further attention to mixing timescale models for reactive scalars is merited.",

The leading-order flame response is shown to be due to the global Lewis number with little influence from the other species. The previously-reported observation of decorrelation of fuel consumption and heat release at high Karlovitz numbers is shown to be solely due to atomic hydrogen diffusion. Finally, it is shown that the suppression of turbulence through the flame cannot be attributed to an increase in viscosity due to the increase in temperature, but that the effect is not negligible. It is further argued that turbulence\u2013flame interactions are better described considering Kolmogorov\u2019s second similarity hypothesis (rather than the first); specifically, by a Karlovitz number that is defined based on the inertial subrange (i.e.\u00a0the energy dissipation rate) rather than the dissipation subrange (i.e.\u00a0viscosity or equivalently Kolmogorov scale quantities).",

We observe extensive thickening of thermal profiles through the flames that increases with turbulent intensity. The high Lewis number of the flames acts to suppress wrinkling of the flame resulting in considerably lower turbulent flame speeds than is observed for lower molecular weight fuels. The impact of high Lewis number is also reflected in a negative correlation of local consumption-based flame speed with curvature. Characteristic of heavy hydrocarbons, pyrolysis of the fuel into smaller fuel fragments is separated in temperature from the primary consumpution of oxygen, which peaks at a higher temperature where the fuel fragments are consumed. The resulting intermediate species are partially entrained within the cool region ahead of the flame, but the overall pyrolysis-oxidation sequence appears essentially unaffected by turbulent mixing; however, the peak rates of these reactions are dramatically reduced.",

The results show that the new framework provides a significant speed-up of kinetics and transport computation, which allows DNS with large kinetic mechanisms, and at the same time maintains high accuracy and good parallel scalability. Detailed diagnostics show that calculation of the chemical source term with ODEPIM is 17 times faster than with a pure implicit solver in this test. OAK utilizes a path flux analysis (PFA) method to reduce the large kinetic mechanism to a smaller size for each location and time step, and it can further speed up the chemical source calculation by 2.7 times in this test. CoTran uses a similar correlation method to make the calculation of mixture-averaged diffusion (MAD) coefficients 72 times faster in this test.

In this work, NO formation in turbulent premixed combustion is investigated via a direct numerical simulation of a temporally evolving methane/air jet flame at a jet Reynolds number of 9000. A detailed chemical mechanism, which in addition to the methane chemistry contains comprehensive NO kinetics is employed in a three-dimensional, shear driven, premixed turbulent configuration computed using 3 billion mesh points. After the fidelity of the DNS database and physical properties of the simulated flame are discussed, the results are used to investigate the interaction of NO chemistry and turbulence in lean premixed flames. To this end, the heat release and NO formation rates are analyzed. These indicate a decorrelation of the heat release and the NO production under highly turbulent conditions. In order to explain and understand this behavior, statistics of individual formation pathways and elementary reactions of the computed turbulent jet flame are compared to an unstretched premixed flame, which could be considered a simple approach used for modeling. Specifically, the formation via the NNH pathway is found to be important for flame generated NO and significantly affected by the turbulence, which is shown to be a consequence of differential diffusion.",

A reduced chemical mechanism for premixed CH4/air flames with NOx based on GRI-Mech3.0 was used, including 268 elementary reactions, and 28 transported species. Consistent post-processing methods were applied to both the DNS and experimental data to evaluate turbulent burning velocity-related statistics, namely the flame surface density (FSD), and the flame curvature. Good agreement was achieved for the 2D comparisons. The DNS data were further analysed and provide 3D statistics unattainable from the experiment. The ratio of the 3D and 2D flame surface densities was estimated. The results are comparable with other values reported for various experimental flames. The 3D and 2D flame curvatures were also compared and their distributions are shown to be quite different owing to the round on-average geometry. Instantaneous images of the heat release surrogate, [CH2O][OH], between the DNS and experiment agreed qualitatively. Various other experimentally obtainable surrogates for heat release rate including [CH2O][H], [CH2O][O], [HCO], and [CH] are also evaluated and compared using the DNS. The inner structure of the flame was compared between the DNS and experiment in terms of the joint PDFs of OH concentration and temperature. Generally good agreement was obtained; discrepancies may be due to the inconsistency of assumed equilibrium levels of OH concentration in the co-flow.",

We also review direct hybrid solar-combustion technologies, which integrate solar-receivers with combustors in the same device, to generate distinctive regimes of combustion. Reactions in these devices are subjected to fluxes of up to \u223c5\u00a0MW/m2 (an order of magnitude higher than in most combustion systems) and wavelengths from the near-IR into the near-UV (whereas most practical systems are subject to predominantly IR irradiation). The broadband irradiation can excite a wide-range of gas-phase reactions in addition to influencing temperature through broad-band heating of soot or reacting particles. Such reactions are coupled non-linearly to the radiation and, in many cases, to the turbulent transport processes, which span a very wide range of temporal and spatial scales. The wavelength selectivity of lasers is also shown to offer the potential to isolate these phenomena, unlike broad-band irradiation, which drives them all simultaneously.",

Spatially resolved measurement of the ultrafine particle size distributions (PSDs) was made by using a scanning mobility particle sizer with a high sensitivity in the 4.45\u2013156.8\u00a0nm size range. The experimental results indicate that, during the residence time of coal particles from \u223c20 ms to \u223c40 ms, the number PSDs under 1200\u00a0K exhibit bi-modal while those under 1500\u00a0K keep uni-modal. As time is evolved, the detected peak of ultrafine particles moves from 10.62\u00a0nm to 80.54\u00a0nm under 1200\u00a0K, while that from 10.76\u00a0nm to 38.46\u00a0nm under 1500\u00a0K. Then, a physico-chemical mechanism responsible for the incipient formation of ultrafine particles during high-sodium lignite combustion was developed and computed by solving a discrete-sectional population balance model. The number PSDs of ultrafine particles and the dynamic behavior of Na release measured in experiments are consistent with the simulation results. It is further divulged that the intrinsic cause of the PSD transition between different ambient temperatures is the high concentration of newly formed particles, instead of the enhanced collision frequency.",

     "abstract": "This paper is concerned with deposition rates of coal ash on a vertical surface in a 100\u00a0kW rated down-flow laboratory coal combustor. At that scale, flow in the post flame where deposition occurs, is laminar, and the deposits on a vertical surface are similar to the early, sticky, inner deposits on horizontal surfaces. Therefore the problem addressed has relevance to understanding mechanisms of deposit formation in general. Experimental data presented here consist of particle size distributions of the ash aerosol, and time resolved measurements of the vertical deposit mass, for various controlled surface temperatures, one coal, and two combustion conditions: air-firing and oxy-firing with 50% inlet O2. Theory consisted of a transport model in which the criterion on whether an ash particle was captured, depended on a newly introduced \u201cThermophoresis Number\u201d, Tp, which is the ratio of the time taken for the particle to contact the (cold) surface through thermophoresis, to that for the particle to pass by the surface. If Tp <\u00a01 the particle is captured; otherwise it escapes. It is assumed that only those particles in the sub-micron vaporization mode are both subject to thermophoresis and will stick to the surface. Using calculated velocity and temperature fields in the fluid next to the vertical surface, and the Tp <\u00a01 criterion alluded to above, it was possible to calculate a two-dimensional cross-sectional area that defined the area through which all particles that will contact the vertical surface must pass. Ash deposition rates so calculated were compared to experimental data. Quantitative agreement between theory and experiment was fair, considering the difficulties in accurately measuring deposition rates and in view of simplifications contained in the model.",

In one set of experiments coal particles were carried by a central jet using a gas mixture of the same composition as the flat flame. By this means a homogenous and connected flame was generated. At the instant when single coal particles transited this stationary flame, start of particle heat-up was well defined. This allows studying start of ignition more accurately compared to the other set of experiments where an inert carrier gas jet was used for transportation of coal particles. Heat-up and ignition were retarded temporally due to precedent mixing between inert gas and ambient flue gases. Coal particles with a high percentage of volatiles (36\u00a0wt%) and a particle distribution ranging from 90 to 125\u00a0\u00b5m were used. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) measurements were performed to characterize ambient gas phase temperatures. By high-speed laser-induced fluorescence, imaging of OH-radicals ignition and volatile combustion was visualized for individual coal particles. Reaction zones surrounding each coal particle and the corresponding distances to coal particles were identified. This distance depended strongly on oxygen concentration of the ambient flue gas atmosphere. In addition to an improved phenomenological understanding the data may serve for model validation.",

     "abstract": "Oxy-fuel combustion technology is deemed a promising technology to the reduction of CO2 emissions during fossil fuel combustion process and has been comprehensively investigated. Many researchers found that the ignition of pulverized coal delayed in O2/CO2 atmospheres compared to in O2/N2 atmospheres with an identical mole fraction of O2 and attributed the ignition delay to the higher volume specific heat of CO2 compared with N2. This paper studied in detail the chemical effects and physical effects (specific heat, radiation characteristics and mass diffusivity) of CO2 on both coal homogeneous and heterogeneous ignitions in O2/CO2 atmospheres. Jovanovic's ignition experiments (Jovanovic et al., 2011, 2012) were adopted to verify the simulated results. The artificial materials X, Y, Z and W were introduced to isolate the effects of chemical properties, specific heat, radiation characteristics and mass diffusivity of CO2 during the homogeneous and heterogeneous ignition process of the coal particle, respectively (as can be seen in Table 3). The results showed that in the homogeneous ignition mechanism of coal in O2/CO2 atmospheres, the reasons for the ignition delay compared to the corresponding O2/N2 atmosphere were higher specific heat and chemical properties of CO2. The chemical properties of CO2 resulted in the ignition delay during the homogeneous ignition of pulverized coal in O2/CO2 atmospheres. High concentration of CO2 resulted in the increase in the amount of heat absorption in the chemistry reaction system, especially R99 (CO2\u00a0+\u00a0H\u00a0\u21d4\u00a0OH\u00a0+\u00a0CO), which was an exothermic reaction in the X case, whereas an endothermic reaction in the CO2 case. Higher specific heat, higher thermal radiation and lower mass diffusion coefficient of CO2 played important roles in the ignition delay in the heterogeneous ignition of pulverized coal in O2/CO2 atmospheres compared to O2/N2 atmospheres.",

     "abstract": "A transient mathematical model was developed to describe soot formation during the combustion of single coal particles based on the static semi-empirical model presented by Fletcher and coworkers. Sensitivity analyses of the model parameters show that soot emissivity and mass diffusivity of tar play an important role in predicting soot volume fraction (fv) and flame temperature (Tf). The model was applied to simulate the combustion of single bituminous coal particles with initial diameter (2r0) of 83\u00a0\u00b5m in a drop tube furnace and air atmosphere. It was found that soot is only formed within the first \u223c 5\u00a0ms after the appearance of the volatile flame. Although most of the soot is oxidized during the volatile flame phase, a small portion of soot still remains during the char combustion. Due to the soot presence, the volatile flame duration is extended by 2.6\u00a0ms. Compared with the soot-free flame, the sooting flame has remarkable lower Tf and its peak Tf value is \u223c 410\u00a0K lower. As a consequence, char combustion starts at a temperature that is \u223c 125\u00a0K lower than that of the soot-free case. Spatially, the peak fv at 16.6\u00a0ms appears at 4.5 r0 and soot oxidation zone spans to \u223c 10 r0. The model was validated by comparing the predicted Tf and fv under different O2 mole fractions (xO2) with recent experimental results reported by Khatami and coworkers. The predicted trends are consistent with those of the experimental results. With increasing xO2, Tf increases, but the increase rate becomes more gradual at a large xO2. While for fv, a non-monotonic variation is observed, where soot first increases and then decreases with a peak value occurring at xO2 \u2248 40%.",

A single particle of a ZDL sample, ca 2.5\u00a0mm in diameter, was suspended on a silicon carbide fibre (142\u00a0\u00b5m) tip and burned in air at 1123\u00a0K in a furnace. The time-resolved ignition and combustion behaviours of the single particles were observed with the aid of combined use of a shortwave infrared camera, a CCD camera, which enabled the determination of the ignition mechanism, ignition time, burnout time and burning rate. A flame emission spectrometer was used to identify the presence of sodium in the flame. The ignition of all ZDL samples followed the joint hetero-homogeneous mechanism in the present work. Upon the homogeneous ignition, ZDL-Raw exhibited a soot free yellowish translucent flame while ZDL-WW and ZDL-AW showed sooty flames. The ignition time followed the order of ZDL-Raw>ZDL-WW>ZDL-AW while the burning rate followed the opposite order. These observations were attributed to the catalytic effect of sodium in the lignite whose amount was varied due to the water and acid washing. Sodium ions were detected in the flame of ZDL with and without washing and the intensity of sodium signal also followed the order of ZDL-Raw>ZDL-WW>ZDL-AW.

However, there is no cooling process in commercial combustion systems and thus the impacts of the cooling process on char reactivity remain unclear. To illustrate this question, a two-step reaction analyzer was developed to study the combustion kinetics of in-situ char, which was produced at a constant high temperature in an inert atmosphere and then directly reacted with oxygen at different temperatures. Two types of Chinese coal, Shenhua sub-bituminous coal and Yangquan anthracite, were selected as samples. The results showed that the reaction rate of in-situ char was about 1.1\u20131.25 times of that of rapid cooling char, suggesting that the cooling process has a significant effect on char reactivity. Then the combustion rate and structure of chars cooled at different cooling rates were investigated to determine the reason for char deactivation during the cooling process. The cooling char reactivity decreased with the decreasing cooling rate, but the specific surface area did not decreased considerably. This result revealed that char deactivation during the cooling process was independent of specific surface area. As the cooling rate decreased, the oxygen chemisorption capacity (active surface area) of cooling char decreased for Shenhua coal, indicating that the observed char deactivation during the cooling process might be caused by the decrease of active surface area. In addition, Yangquan anthracite, as a high rank coal, was less sensitive to the cooling process due to its higher carbon crystallites and provision of fewer active sites for oxidation.",

The present simulation reproduced an unstable flame state occurring at a lower coal feed rate.

     "abstract": "Practical simulation of industrial-scale coal combustion relies on the ability to accurately capture the dynamics of coal subprocesses while also ensuring the computational cost remains reasonable. The majority of the residence time occurs post-devolatilization, so it is of great importance that a balance between the computational efficiency and accuracy of char combustion models is carefully considered. In this work, we consider the importance of model fidelity during char combustion by comparing combinations of simple and complex gas and particle-phase chemistry models. Detailed kinetics based on the GRI 3.0 mechanism and infinitely-fast chemistry are considered in the gas-phase. The Char Conversion Kinetics model and nth-Order Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model are considered for char consumption. For devolatilization, the Chemical Percolation and Devolatilization and Kobayashi-Sarofim models are employed. The relative importance of gasification versus oxidation reactions in air and oxyfuel environments is also examined for various coal types. Results are compared to previously published experimental data collected under laminar, single-particle conditions. Calculated particle temperature histories are strongly dependent on the choice of gas phase and char chemistry models, but only weakly dependent on the chosen devolatilization model. Particle mass calculations were found to be very sensitive to the choice of devolatilization model, but only somewhat sensitive to the choice of gas chemistry and char chemistry models. High-fidelity models for devolatilization generally resulted in particle temperature and mass calculations that were closer to experimentally observed values.",

     "abstract": "The high levels of CO2 and H2O in oxy-fuel/oxy-steam combustion are expected to have important effects on the oxidation of ferrous sulfide, which is critical to the understanding of ash deposition. In this work, the kinetics of ferrous sulfide oxidation in CO2, H2O, or the mixtures of CO2 and H2O are explored on a purposely-designed thermo-gravimetric reactor (TGR). Based on the data obtained from TGR, XRD and SEM, the roles of CO2 and H2O in the oxidation of ferrous sulfide are elucidated. It is found that pyrrhotite (FeS1+x) transformation in CO2, H2O, or their mixtures is dominated by the oxidation of ferrous sulfide (FeS). The adsorption and desorption elemental reactions of CO2 or H2O on ferrous sulfide are essentially the same. For all cases, the three-dimensional diffusion model can be used to account for the oxidation of ferrous sulfide. The reaction rate constants for the oxidation of ferrous sulfide increase with increasing the partial pressure of the oxidant. The dependence of the reaction rate constant on the partial pressure of CO2 or H2O can be well explained by the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood rate forms. In the mixtures of CO2 and H2O, the active sites for the FeS\u2013CO2 reaction and the FeS\u2013H2O reaction are partially independent and partially shared.",

The devolatilization rates are directly determined from CPD for each coal particle. The flamelet is generated from non-premixed one-dimensional gaseous flames and is based on mixture fractions for volatiles and methane as well as on enthalpy and scalar dissipation rate. A transport equation for mixture fraction variance is combined with an assumed pdf approach for modeling turbulence-chemistry interaction. Special emphasis is put on the influence of devolatilization, with a comparison of LES with direct CPD coupling to empirical models with fitted and standard rate constants. The results are further analyzed by scatter plots and phase space trajectories of the quantities of interest. The results show that large deviations between CPD and the fitted model exist on the instantaneous particle level. It is shown that the direct use of CPD in the LES is feasible and that the flamelet model is able to perform well. Some weaknesses specific to the CRIEPI flame are also discussed.",

To do this, two coals, i.e., the ZD subbituminous coal and the PDS bituminous coal, were acid-washed to remove most inorganic compositions. The acid-washed coals were then loaded with identical contents of organically-bound Na and excluded quartz to produce the Na\u00a0+\u00a0Si loaded coals, which were then combusted via a high temperature drop tube furnace (DTF) at 1500\u00a0\u00b0C in air to collect the inorganic PM10 for subsequent analyses. Burning the Na\u00a0+\u00a0Si loaded coals with simplified and identical mineral compositions enabled us to purposely study the real effects of coal particle combustion on PM10 emission. The results demonstrate the trimodal distributions of PM10 produced from the Na\u00a0+\u00a0Si loaded coals containing such simple inorganic compositions. The combustion of PDS Na\u00a0+\u00a0Si loaded coal seems to form more PM than that of ZD Na\u00a0+\u00a0Si loaded coal. In contrast to the combustion of the ZD subbituminous coal, more Na and SiO are vaporized to form more PM0.5 due to the higher peak burning temperature of the PDS bituminous coal during the stage of volatile matter combustion, meanwhile, more coalescence of quartz occurs due to its melting point being decreased by the heterogeneous condensation of Na, causing more PM2.5\u201310 being generated from the combustion of the PDS bituminous coal. When the PDS Si-only loaded coal is burned, the coalescence of quartz particles should be suppressed due to the lack of condensed Na. In addition, its lower char burning temperature can also suppress the coalescence of fine quartz particles, forming less PM2.5\u201310 compared with the combustion of the ZD Si-only loaded coal. The results suggest that both the stages of volatile matter combustion and char combustion of coal particles can affect the emission of PM10.",

The results in this study show that biomass particle size has a significant effect on bed agglomeration during biomass fast pyrolysis at 500\u00a0\u00b0C. Sand loading, which is defined as the mass of sand sticking to the biomass particles normalised to the total mass of biomass fed, is used for quantifying the interaction between the pyrolysing biomass particle and sand in fluidised bed to form bed agglomerates. Under the experimental conditions, at biomass particle sizes \u2264430\u00a0\u00b5m, sand loading increases with increasing biomass particle size. At biomass particle sizes >430\u00a0\u00b5m, sand loading decreases with further increase in biomass particle size. The results further show that mass transfer of the sticky agent produced from biomass pyrolysis plays a key role in bed agglomeration. At small particle sizes (\u2264430\u00a0\u00b5m), sand loading is dominantly influenced by convective mass transfer of sticky agent while at large particle sizes (>430\u00a0\u00b5m), sand loading is mainly controlled by diffusive mass transfer of sticky agent within the pyrolysing biomass particle.",

     "abstract": "A notable characteristic of solid biomass fuels as compared to coal is their significantly higher potassium content. Potassium influences ash deposition and corrosion mechanisms in furnaces and boilers, the effects of which may differ depending on phase transformations of potassium species in the gas phase and condensed phase. An understanding of how potassium is released from biomass fuels during the combustion process is therefore useful for plant designers and operators assessing means of avoiding or mitigating these potential problems. An experimental method is used to measure release patterns from single particles of biomass fuels using flame emission spectroscopy and a single-particle combustion rig. The experimental arrangement also allowed simultaneous thermal imaging of the combusting particle in order to determine the surface temperature. A model of the single particle combustion is presented. Using experimental data on devolatilisation and burnout times for different sized particles and the measured surface temperature profiles, the thermal and kinetic sub-models are verified. A model for potassium release is described and this is integrated to the single particle combustion model to allow prediction of the temporal patterns of release of gas-phase potassium. The modelled release patterns were compared with those observed. Good agreement between modelled and measured potassium release patterns was attained confirming that the proposed mechanisms affecting potassium release are valid.",

Five biomass fuels were studied, namely, wheat straw, kiwi branches, vine branches, sycamore branches and pine bark. Coal was also tested for comparison purposes. Tests were carried out in an optical flat flame McKenna burner able to produce a confined laminar flow of combustion products, in which single particles were injected upward through a central hole. The equivalence ratio and the thermal input of the burner were adjusted to yield the following operating conditions in the ignition zone: five mean temperatures (1500, 1575, 1650, 1700 and 1800\u00a0K) and three mean dry oxygen concentrations (3.5, 5.1 and 6.5\u00a0vol. %). The ignition mode and the ignition delay time were evaluated through the analysis of images obtained by means of a CMOS high-speed camera. The effects of gas temperature and oxygen concentration on the ignition mode and ignition delay time were assessed. For the studied conditions, the ignition of the biomass particles generally occurred in the gas-phase, although surface ignition was also observed in some cases. The results suggest that the critical diameter for the ignition mode transition varies with the fuel type. All particles show a consistent trend of decreasing ignition delay time with increasing gas temperature, with the biomass particles presenting slightly higher values than the coal tested. The estimated drying times were subtracted from the total ignition delay time and the trends shifted, with the pine bark and wheat straw presenting a lower remaining time than the coal. Finally, for the studied oxygen concentration range, its variation did not have a significant impact on the ignition mode and delay time at high temperatures.",

The concentration of sodium and potassium in the gas phase above a biomass particle was measured; quantitative and time resolved data were acquired by means of the Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) technique. LIBS made it possible to extend the measurements of alkali metal concentration to the sooty pyrolysis stage. Data from the measurements revealed a staged release of alkali metals from biomass. Two distinct peaks of concentrations were observed, one associated with the pyrolysis stage and the other with the gasification stage. Since during the pyrolysis stage a large temperature gradient exists inside the particle, numerical simulations were carried out to explain the experimental measurements and extract the kinetic data. Using a detailed particle model, the rates of potassium and sodium release from the particle during the pyrolysis stage were attained. For sodium release the activation energy was found to be in the range of 218\u2009to 248\u2009kJ/mole and for potassium release it was found to be between 168 and 198\u2009kJ/mole.

This study investigates the effect of alkali addition on sulfur transformation as well as the release of the sulfur-containing gases during sewage sludge pyrolysis at 150\u2212450\u00a0\u00b0C. The presence of alkali can promote the transformation of unstable organic aliphatic and aromatic sulfurs into more stable sulfoxides and sulphonic acid at low temperatures (i.e., 250\u00a0\u00b0C). Alkalis also fix the inorganic sulfide and sulphate in char. Therefore, the release of the sulfur-containing gases can be greatly reduced with alkali addition. Stronger alkalis show more significant effect on the reduction of sulfur-containing gases, likely because of more OH radicals generated for the transformation of organic sulfurs.",

A pre- column derivatization with benzoyl chloride prior to HPLC analysis is applied for the quantification of anhydro-sugars (levoglucosan, cellobiosan, maltosan) from pyrolysis. At low temperatures, the additions of inorganics salts, especially CaCl2, weakens hydrogen bonds, resulting in high yields of levoglucosan and cellobiosan from the cleavage of glycosidic bonds rather than from dehydration reactions. At elevated temperatures, dehydration reactions in the sugar units are mainly responsible for the destruction of sugar rings followed by the scission of pyran rings, leading to the weight-loss of CaCl2-loaded cellulose in the form of low molecular weight organic species. Meanwhile, accumulated unsaturated structures suppress the cleavage of glycosidic bonds, leading to the formation of char. However, KCl appears to catalyze the cleavage of glycosidic bonds or the scission of pyran rings directly, which perhaps occurs through a homolytic mechanism, leading to low molecular weight species. Furthermore, maltosan is shown to be a secondary product and is catalyzed by KCl and CaCl2 indirectly through the repolymerization of levoglucosan in the solid phase. A modified mechanism is also proposed regarding cellulose pyrolysis and the primary catalysis of KCl and CaCl2.",

These pretreatments of seaweed were signifi after water-washed and acid-washed (7%, 10, Ca, Na and Mg metals. Among these pretreatments the removal capacity of H2SO4 was the most obvious. The pyrolysis behaviors of materials after pretreatments have been studied using thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy. During the pretreatments, OH, CO/CH, SO and CO functional groups in Enteromorpha were cleaved. Phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid made the intensities of the absorption peaks of OH and SO decrease the most obvious, respectively. Therefore, there was almost no NO2 and SO2 emission in the process of pyrolysis of Enteromorpha washed by hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid. The volatile components of Enteromorpha were easy to evolve after the pretreatment. Sulfuric acid exhibited the best efficiency in the process of pyrolysis, and it manifested smaller influence on other volatile organics simultaneously. However, the maximum weight loss rate and the corresponding temperature reduced after pretreatments, and the maximum weight loss rate reduced more distinctly after 7% hydrochloric acid treatment.

     "abstract": "Tailoring solid propellant burning rates is a perpetual goal of solid propellant designers. Many methods have been used to alter the burning rate including changing the propellant formulation, adding burning rate modifiers, and changing the propellant core shape. Alternatively, metallic fibers such as copper and silver have been added to propellants to increase the burning rate by providing fast heat diffusion paths. However, these metallic wires do not significantly add further to the energetics and have a limited tailoring range. In this paper we describe the effect of embedding mechanically-activated aluminum/polytetrafluoroethylene (Al/PTFE) reactive foils, nickel/aluminum nanofoils and Pyrofuze\u00ae self-alloying wire in an AP/HTPB composite propellant. We quantify the resulting burning rate and compare the burning rate to propellants with embedded copper wires. We find that the nickel/aluminum nanofoils and Pyrofuze\u00ae wire provide a constant increase in local burning rate regardless of pressure, while the local burning rates of propellants with Al/PTFE foils change as a function of pressure. The Al/PTFE foil is consumed, releasing significant gas, unlike the other materials investigated. The Al/PTFE foil combustion products contribute to the energy and gas production of the propellant, resulting in a propellant efficiency larger than typical wired propellants. While the other materials increase propellant burning rate by causing an increase in surface area and therefore mass burning rate, the aluminum and carbon liberated by the Al/PTFE wire reaction can oxidize with the propellant products and increase the temperature of the combustion gases. Additionally, Al/PTFE or similar reactive wires could result in a decrease in slag production compared to inert and self-alloying wires (i.e., copper, nickel/aluminum nanofoils and Pyrofuze\u00ae) and may be better suited to use in propellants due to the high burning rate tailorability and the participation in propellant combustion.",

However, little work has focused on investigating microexplosive metal fuels to enhance the metal fuel combustion efficiency in traditional energetic material formulations. Microscopic surface videography was performed on two solid propellant formulations, one using aluminum (baseline) and the other with 80/20\u00a0wt% Al\u2013Li alloy as fuel additives. It was observed that the propellant combustion with neat aluminum formed large molten droplets at the surface as aluminum particles agglomerate, which is a well-known problem with aluminized propellants. In contrast, the Al\u2013Li propellant formed an Al\u2013Li melt-layer on the propellant surface during combustion. Droplets were ejected from the surface melt-layer through dispersive boiling. Above the surface, further dispersive boiling is observed from the ejected droplets and droplet-shattering microexplosions are also observed. These dynamics are thought to be a result of a large disparity in volatility (i.e., boiling points) between the metals in the molten alloy and the large Lewis number in the droplet, so that superheating occurs before the more volatile component (here Li) can diffuse to the surface. A Lewis number of 7440 was estimated for molten 80/20\u00a0wt% Al\u2013Li alloy, which is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than typical multicomponent liquid hydrocarbon droplets that microexplode, suggesting a higher propensity for molten droplet microexplosions. This would also indicate that a smaller amount of the volatile component might be necessary for microexplosions and dispersive boiling than observed for liquid hydrocarbon fuels. These dynamics are important for metal fuel applications, because injectors cannot be used to decrease droplet size in a metallized energetic material formulation.",

However, micron-sized Al particles are difficult to ignite and react slowly, leading to problems such as incomplete combustion and product agglomeration. Many pioneering strategies have been investigated to overcome the above challenges, ranging from reducing Al particles to nanoscale, coating them with metallic or polymeric materials, to blending Al with other materials to form composites. On the other hand, porous Si has emerged as a promising energetic material with a volumetric energy density comparable to Al, high reactivity at low temperature, and ultrafast flame propagation speeds. To date, the potential of using porous Si as an additive to enhance ignition and combustion of micron-sized Al has not been explored. Herein, we experimentally investigated the effect of porous Si addition on the ignition and combustion characteristics of micron-sized Al with CuO nanoparticles. We consistently observed that the addition of porous Si facilitates both ignition and combustion of Al/CuO mixtures over a wide range of experimental conditions, ranging from slow heating rate conditions in differential scanning calorimetry, fast heating rate conditions in Xe flash ignition, flame propagation in microchannels, to constant-volume pressure vessel experiments. The enhancement effects are attributed to the easy ignition and fast burning properties of porous Si, which elevate the ambient temperature and/or pressure, and hence enhance the ignition, reaction rate, and combustion efficiency of micron-sized Al particles. This work demonstrates that adding porous Si is another viable strategy toward enhancing the ignition and combustion properties of micron-sized Al particles.",

Further, the combustion of agglomerates is numerically studied by a newly-developed model, which accurately predicts both burn time and temperature of agglomerate of the mild combustion process. The microexplosion phenomenon occurs when the oxygen concentration exceeds 3.5\u00a0mol/m3. Measurements of particle temperature, burn time, emission spectra and morphologies indicate that this explosion is driven by the vaporization of unreacted aluminum core, which results in huge stresses to tear the Al/Al2O3 particle into many smaller, dispersed clusters. Thus a melt/vapor dispersion mechanism (MVDM) based on melt dispersion mechanism is proposed to cover the microexplosion and subsequent accelerated oxidation reactions.",

A simplified reaction system is used, where the solid\u2013fluid reaction is represented by a single isothermal reaction step. It is found that, due to the clustering of particles by the isotropic turbulence, the overall reaction rate is entirely controlled by the turbulence for large Damk\u00f6hler numbers. The particle clustering significantly slows down the reaction rate for increasing Damk\u00f6hler numbers which reaches an asymptotic limit that can be analytically derived. This implies that the effect of turbulence on heterogeneously reacting particles should be included in models that are used in CFD simulations of e.g. char burnout in combustors or gasifiers. Such a model, based on the chemical and turbulent time scales, is here proposed for the heterogeneous reaction rate in the presence of turbulence.",

     "abstract": "In this work, a mechanistic ash particle sticking and rebound criterion is developed and validated against experimental data. The model is able to predict the threshold of particle sticking and rebound as a function of the particle kinetic energy. Furthermore, it explains the selective deposition of large iron-rich and small aluminum silicate particles, which were found in deposits on a cooled probe taken in a pulverized solid fuel fired power plant. Large particles stick to the deposition probe due to their low viscosity caused by the formation of a low melting eutectic. Small aluminum silicate particles completely dissipate their kinetic energy during the impact due to viscous deformation. There is no excess energy left for them to rebound. It is shown, that the particle kinetic energy and viscosity are key parameters for the sticking propensity. The model is extended for deposit properties, enabling the capture of solid or solidified particles on a sticky surface. Since all input parameters can be calculated, it is suitable for the application in CFD codes. The required data are the particle and deposit composition, their temperatures in combination with the particle kinetic energy just before the impact.",

     "abstract": "Flame propagation through a non-volatile solid-fuel suspension is studied using a simplified, time-dependent numerical model that considers the influence of both diffusional and kinetic rates on the particle combustion process. It is assumed that particles react via a single-step, first-order Arrhenius surface reaction with an oxidizer delivered to the particle surface through gas diffusion. Unlike the majority of models previously developed for flames in suspensions, no external parameters are imposed, such as particle ignition temperature, combustion time, or the assumption of either kinetic- or diffusion-limited particle combustion regimes. Instead, it is demonstrated that these parameters are characteristic values of the flame propagation problem that must be solved together with the burning velocity, and that the a priori imposition of these parameters from single-particle combustion data may result in erroneous predictions. It is also shown that both diffusive and kinetic reaction regimes can alternate within the same flame and that their interaction may result in non-trivial flame behavior. In fuel-lean mixtures, it is demonstrated that this interaction leads to certain particle size ranges where burning velocity increases with increasing particle size, opposite to the expected trend. For even leaner mixtures, the interplay between kinetic and diffusive reaction rates leads to the appearance of a new type of flame instability where kinetic and diffusive regimes alternate in time, resulting in a pulsating regime of flame propagation.",

     "abstract": "The dynamics of flame propagation in systems with infinite Lewis number and spatially discretized sources of heat release is examined, which is applicable to the combustion of suspensions of fuel particles in air. The system is analyzed numerically using a one-dimensional heat equation with a source term for the reaction progress variable, which is specified to have zero diffusivity, and the model reveals a spectrum of flame-propagation regimes. For the case of a switch-type reaction rate and homogeneous media (continuous regime), the flame propagates steadily at a velocity in agreement with analytical solutions. As the sources are spatially concentrated into \u03b4-function-like sources, propagation approaches the discrete regime with a fixed period between ignition of the sources, for which an analytic solution is also available for validation. When the source term is governed by an Arrhenius rate and the activation energy is increased beyond the stability boundary, the flame begins to exhibit a long-wavelength (4\u20135 times the thermal flame thickness) oscillation characteristic of the thermo-diffusive instability, in good agreement with prior stability analysis. When spatial discreteness is introduced, a competition is observed between the long-period oscillations of the thermo-diffusive instability and the pulsations associated with the rapid heat release of the concentrated sources. Interestingly, the presence of spatial discreteness is able to excite higher modes (period doubling and chaotic solutions) of the thermo-diffusive instability, suggesting that the introduction of discreteness may have an influence qualitatively similar to that of increasing activation energy. Relevance of the model parameters to experimental systems is then discussed.",

The review focuses on the initial kernel development, the evolution of a spherical or edge flame, and the ignition of the spray flame when viewed at the whole combustor scale. The factors that determine success or failure of the ignition process at the various phases of the overall burner ignition are discussed through experiments and Direct Numerical Simulations, while modelling efforts are also assessed. The fuel volatility, droplet size, overall fuel-to-air ratio, and the degree of pre-evaporation are the important factors that distinguish spray ignition from gaseous flame ignition, and the extra fluctuations introduced by the random droplet locations, and how this may affect modelling and flame evolution, are highlighted. The flame propagation mechanism in laminar and turbulent sprays is one of the key aspects determining overall ignition success. Suggestions for future research are discussed.",

This approach was found to offer the convenience of using a single set of equations, without the need for submodels, to predict drop breakup or vaporization. A hyperbolic spline kernel function was employed to eliminate the tensile instability that often has been reported in the literature. The numerical method presented here was found to successfully model the merging, stretching separation, fragmentation, and generation of secondary droplets in high-velocity collisions. In predicting vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium, a variable-smoothing-length function was implemented to better facilitate the evaluation of vapor density at low temperatures.

A pair of alumina/silica fibers of 7\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter was applied to suspend a droplet. The ambient pressure was varied in the range of 1.0\u20133.0\u00a0MPa, and the ambient temperature was set at 773\u00a0K. Sequential backlit images of an evaporating droplet were recorded using a high-speed digital video camera. Temporal variations in the droplet diameter were measured using a self-made computer-aided image analyzer. Microgravity conditions were produced by a 50-m drop tower. Temporal variations in the droplet diameter were successfully obtained for droplet evaporations in the supercritical environments. The normalized droplet lifetime increased with the ambient pressure. The evaporation rate constant increased with the ambient pressure, reached the maximum value at an ambient pressure slightly above the critical pressure of the fuel, and then decreased. The initial heat-up period linearly increased with the ambient pressure, reached the maximum value at an ambient pressure of 2.0\u00a0MPa, and then decreased. The ratio of the initial heat-up period to droplet lifetime increased with the ambient pressure, reached the maximum value of about 0.6 at an ambient pressure of 2.0\u00a0MPa, and then decreased. The droplet evaporation lifetime increased with the ambient pressure at subcritical ambient pressures even though the evaporation rate constant increased because the increase in the initial heat-up period overtook the decrease in the quasi-steady evaporation period.

Spray from the simplex nozzle is swirled by the primary air and impinges on the inner tube\u2014the prefilmer, undergoes filming, and convects to the tube tip to form a liquid rim, which is sheared by the counter-rotating swirl into finer droplets. Stage-wise phase Doppler particle analyzer measurements indicate the final spray to be much finer than the simplex nozzle spray after undergoing the above processes. Time resolved laser induced fluorescence (TR-LIF) imaging techniques are applied to visualize the wall filming and primary atomization inside the injector. The simplex nozzle spray velocity under the influence of air swirl flow is measured using stereo-particle image velocimetry. The precessing vortex core from the primary swirl imparts a precessing motion to the simplex spray, which in turn induces a non-uniform filming on the prefilmer. The droplet impingement on the prefilmer leads to splashing and crater formation on the surface. The crater size distribution is obtained and compared to the droplet size of the injector spray before impingement. The film thickness variation on the prefilmer surface and the rim thickness are estimated from planar LIF experiments along with a long distance microscope.

To this end, a model is developed that considers the evaporation of a monodisperse droplet cloud in a homogeneous and isobaric gas-phase environment. The mathematical model accounts for physico-chemical relevant processes, involving (i) species diffusion in the liquid phase, (ii) two-phase thermodynamic equilibrium and (iii) gas-phase chemistry. After evaluating the accuracy of individual model components against available experimental data, the model is applied to investigate the ignition of a surrogate mixture for a Jet-A fuel (POSF 4658) at conditions of interest to gas turbine engines. A parametric study is performed to examine effects on the interaction between multicomponent evaporation and ignition. It is found that the maximum reactivity occurs for conditions at which the ignition time in the gas phase is comparable to the evaporation time. At these conditions, the mixture composition is significantly affected by preferential evaporation, which in turn affects the reactivity of the gas phase. It is shown that intradroplet diffusion plays a major role on the radial droplet composition, thereby conditioning the evaporation rates of single species.

The impact of local equivalence ratio, droplet diameter and jet velocity have been investigated by varying these parameters. The results reveal that the temporally-evolving jet is a promising numerical configuration to study spray-turbulence interaction, evaporation, mixing, and auto-ignition mechanisms. It is observed that the autoignition delay time strongly depends on the droplet diameter and jet velocity, while it is far less sensitive onto the equivalence ratio.

     "abstract": "Combustion characteristics of an ethanol-in-decane emulsion droplet and a droplet group under puffing conditions have been investigated by direct numerical simulation (DNS). Before puffing, a quasi-steady flame is formed in the wake of the parent decane droplet. Due to superheating, boiling of ethanol sub-droplets is initiated. Following rapid growth of the vapor bubble, ethanol vapor is unsteadily ejected out and interacts with the downstream wake flame. The local gas mixture fraction is affected by this ejection. The gas-phase temperature and reaction rate also show different characteristics from those of a 1D steady flame. In the dual-fuel system, fuel/air mixing in combustion can be characterized by the scalar dissipation rates (SDRs) due to mixing of decane/air and ethanol/air and cross mixing of decane/ethanol. The transient interaction between the droplet wake flame and the ejected vapor by puffing is evident in the flame S-curves. The interaction is further quantified by the budget analysis in the mixture fraction \u2013 SDR space. The contribution of the cross SDR between decane and ethanol to the rate of change of the SDR of the primary fuel decane is initially negative, which is particular to puffing. Later the cross SDR can also become positive. As the mixing continues, the magnitude of the SDRs becomes smaller. When puffing occurs in the transverse direction, the ejected vapor may sweep a region within a few diameters away from the parent decane droplet. If other emulsion droplets are in this region of influence, inter-droplet interactions occur. A multiple-droplet case demonstrates this interaction and implies that such an interaction will occur in an emulsion fuel spray and should be considered in modeling a multi-component emulsion fuel spray in a combustor.",

     "abstract": "Observations of \u201cCool Flame\u201d burning for large diameter isolated droplets on board the International Space Station have stimulated interest in combustion initiation/generation of non-premixed combustion modes. For a number of n-alkane fuels at large initial droplet diameters, the initiation process was observed to first establish a hot flame condition that radiatively extinguished, followed by a quasi-steady, \u201cCool Flame\u201d droplet burning mode. However, recent large diameter n-decane experiments show that depending on the ignition energy supplied, the first stage hot flame condition was absent, with an apparent, direct establishment of a \u201cCool Flame\u201d burning mode that continued to diffusive extinction. Here we report these experimental observations and elucidate the underlying parameters resulting in dual and single stage \u201cCool Flame\u201d burning. Detailed, transient sphero-symmetric droplet combustion modeling is applied to interpret the experiments. The simulations indicate that the balance and duration of the ignition energy applied, the energy release associated with reaction of partially premixed fuel vapor surrounding the droplet, heat flux to the drop surface, and far field diffusive heat loss all play key roles as to whether a dual stage, radiatively extinguished hot-flame-to-Cool-Flame-transition for only large droplets or direct establishment of \u201cCool Flame\u201d burning for all droplet sizes occurs. The rate at which the reactive partially premixed vapor layer surrounding the droplet is formed, its volume, and its subsequent reaction significantly influence the observed transition to \u201cCool Flame\u201d burning. The initial droplet temperature relative to saturation and flash point temperatures of the fuel and the liquid phase heat capacity contribute to the thermal transport requirement at the droplet surface for establishing the partially premixed reactive layer surrounding the droplet, which through its reaction history defines whether a transition to \u201cCool Flame\u201d burning can be initiated without a requirement for radiative extinction of a hot flame burning mode.",

     "abstract": "A recent set of experiments carried out onboard the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that large n-alkane droplets, after the radiative extinction of the visible flame, can burn quasi-steadily in a low-temperature regime, up to a diffusive extinction accompanied by the formation of a vapor cloud. The experiments have also demonstrated that small droplets are unable to exhibit radiative extinction, but instead burn to completion or disruptively extinguish.In this work, we applied a mathematical model able to reproduce the experimental data in terms of vaporization rates, standoff ratios, extinction diameters. A detailed kinetic mechanism (with \u223c450 species and \u223c17,000 reactions) was taken into account, in order to correctly reproduce the low-temperature combustion regime. The role of several parameters (initial diameter of the droplet, composition of the gaseous environment, and pressure) on the extinction of the hot-temperature flames was numerically investigated. Predictions are found in good agreement with experimental measurements, showing that only droplets with an initial diameter larger than a critical diameter undergo radiative extinction. A linear relationship between the squared critical diameter and the molar fraction of oxygen in the atmosphere was found and demonstrated on the basis of scaling arguments.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents recent progress in the field of thermoacoustic combustion instabilities in propulsion engines such as rockets or gas turbines. Combustion instabilities have been studied for more than a century in simple laminar configurations as well as in laboratory-scale turbulent flames. These instabilities are also encountered in real engines but new mechanisms appear in these systems because of obvious differences with academic burners: larger Reynolds numbers, higher pressures and power densities, multiple inlet systems, complex fuels. Other differences are more subtle: real engines often feature specific unstable modes such as azimuthal instabilities in gas turbines or transverse modes in rocket chambers. Hydrodynamic instability modes can also differ as well as the combustion regimes, which can require very different simulation models. The integration of chambers in real engines implies that compressor and turbine impedances control instabilities directly so that the determination of the impedances of turbomachinery elements becomes a key issue. Gathering experimental data on combustion instabilities is difficult in real engines and large Eddy simulation (LES) has become a major tool in this field. Recent examples, however, show that LES is not sufficient and that theory, even in these complex systems, plays a major role to understand both experimental and LES results and to identify mitigation techniques.",

     "abstract": "Combustion is essential to the manufacture of carbon black, fumed oxides, optical fibers and, recently, new high-value products like carbon nanotubes, nanosilver and biomagnetic nanofluids that are driven to market predominantly by start-ups. This technology is attractive for material synthesis for its proven scalability as it does not involve the tedious steps of wet chemistry and can readily form stably metastable compositions and high purity products.Recent advances in aerosol and combustion sciences reveal that coagulation and sintering and/or surface growth control product particle size and morphology through the high temperature particle residence time, self-preserving size distribution and power laws for fractal-like particles. This motivates synthesis of an array of unique particle compositions and morphologies primarily by spray combustion leading to new catalysts, gas sensors, bio-materials and, most recently, to hand-held devices such as breath analysis sensors for monitoring chronic illnesses. In particular, multi-scale process design integrating mesoscale and molecular dynamics facilitates understanding of combustion product development.The latter also contributes to understanding of aggregation and surface growth of nascent soot, a bona fide nanostructured material! So here nascent soot dynamics, after nucleation or inception, are investigated through accounting of soot agglomeration and surface growth by acetylene pyrolysis. Neglecting the fractal-like nature of soot underestimates its mobility diameter and polydispersity up to 40%. The evolution of nascent soot structure from spheres to aggregates is quantified by the mass fractal dimension and mass\u2013mobility exponent, in excellent agreement with microscopic and mass\u2013mobility measurements in a standard burner-stabilized stagnation ethylene flame. Surface growth chemically bonds the constituent primary particles of these aggregates, while the effect of soot volume fraction on soot morphology is elucidated. Based on aggregate projected area, a scaling law is derived for determining the primary particle size of nascent soot aggregates from mass\u2013mobility measurements rather than tedious image counting.",

Recent advances in theoretical methodologies and computational capabilities have transformed theoretical chemical kinetics from a largely empirical to a highly predictive science. As a result, theoretical chemistry is playing an increasingly significant role in the combustion modeling enterprise. The accurate prediction of the temperature and pressure dependence of gas phase reactions requires state-of-the-art implementations of a variety of theoretical methods: ab initio electronic structure theory, transition state theory, classical trajectory simulations, and the master equation. In this work, we illustrate the current state-of-the-art in predicting the kinetics of gas-phase reactions through sample calculations for some prototypical reactions central to combustion chemistry. These studies are used to highlight the success of theory, as well as its remaining challenges, through comparisons with experiments ranging from elementary reaction kinetics studies through to global observations such as flame speed measurements. The illustrations progress from the treatment of relatively simple abstraction and addition reactions, which proceed over a single transition state, through to the complexity of multiwell multichannel reactions that commonly occur in studies of the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition to providing high quality rate prescriptions for combustion modelers, theory will be seen to indicate various shortcomings in the foundations of chemical modeling. Future progress in the fidelity of the chemical modeling of combustion will benefit from more widespread applications of theoretical chemical kinetics and from increasingly intimate couplings of theory, experiment, and modeling.",

     "abstract": "Biomass fuels differ in many ways from the conventional fossil fuels used in combustion processes, such as coal. They often have high moisture contents, lower heating values, and a variety of minor constituents, such as chlorine, sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, and a variety of ash-forming metals. These special properties of biomass fuels cause several challenges, but in many cases also provide advantages, to their use in combustion processes. Design of the combustion devices and choice of their operating parameters are very dependent on the detailed properties of the biomass fuel or fuels to be used. Often these challenges are connected to the fate and chemistry of the many minor constituents or impurities of the fuels. This paper reviews some of such chemical details related to biomass combustion that are important to take into consideration in the use of biomass combustion processes. The focus of the paper is in large, industrial scale combustion technologies for biomass and biomass derived waste fuels, either in district heating or also power production. Areas discussed are biomass particle conversion and biomass char oxidation reactivity, nitrogen and sulfur reactions in furnaces, superheater fouling and corrosion due to biomass ashes, low-temperature corrosion, and bed sintering in fluidized bed furnaces. The advances in understanding chemical details of biomass combustion have strongly contributed to the development of more reliable and efficient boiler technologies. Unresolved challenges are still connected to simultaneous combustion of several different biomasses and interaction of fuel ashes in such applications.",

     "abstract": "Often, the first step of fuel combustion is the formation of fuel radicals. These radicals can be formed via hydrogen abstraction and are typically rovibrationally excited due to the energy release from the reaction. These excitations increase the population at high energies, thus increase the probability for \u03b2-scission of the fuel radical. Hot \u03b2-scission of such non-thermal radicals can be interpreted as well-skipping reaction from the bimolecular hydrogen abstraction reactants to the dissociation products.In the present study, the impact of non-Boltzmann radical distributions on \u03b2-scission kinetics is screened for several hundred fuels. For that purpose, the free energy release between stable stationary points is predicted using group contribution theory. Based on that screening, fuel radicals with potentially pronounced \u03b2-scission of rovibrationally excited fuel radicals are picked for more detailed study.Hot \u03b2-scission is found to significantly contribute to the CO2 loss reactions of formate radicals formed via hydrogen abstraction. Especially for methyl formate, \u03b2-scission of non-thermal radicals is found to dominate over a wide range of temperature and pressure. This reveals the need for including the origin of reactants of \u03b2-scission reactions.",

They appear as important intermediates during the low-temperature oxidation of conventional hydrocarbon fuels and of heavy biofuels such as long-chain fatty acid methyl esters. The reaction of tetrahydrofuran with OH radicals was investigated in a shock tube, over a temperature range of 800\u20131340 K and at pressures near 1.5 bar. Hydroxyl radicals were generated by the rapid thermal decomposition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and a UV laser absorption technique was used to monitor the mole fraction of OH radicals. High-level CCSD(T)/cc-pV(D,T)Z//MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ quantum chemical calculations were performed to explore the chemistry of the THF\u00a0+\u00a0OH reaction system. Our calculations reveal that the THF\u00a0+\u00a0OH (R1) reaction proceeds via either direct or indirect H-abstraction from various sites, leading to the formation of tetrahydrofuran-2-yl (THF-R2) or tetrahydrofuran-3-yl (THF-R3) radicals and water. Theoretical kinetic analysis revealed that both channels are important under conditions relevant to combustion.

The OH radicals, produced pyrolytically from tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), were quantitatively measured by UV absorption using a narrow-linewidth laser near 306.69 nm, targeting the well-characterized R1(5) rovibronic transition of OH in the A-X (0, 0) band. The high sensitivity of this OH diagnostic allowed for very dilute reactant concentrations, which simplified the reaction systems to pseudo-first-order kinetics. For each aldehyde + OH, its overall rate constant was inferred by fitting simulated OH profiles to the measured OH time histories when a detailed reaction mechanism for this aldehyde was available, or directly from exponential fits to the measured OH time-histories (after correcting for a small effect of different TBHP/aldehyde ratios).

In light of this, the current study presents quantum-chemically-derived high-pressure limit rate coefficients for all cyclisation reactions leading to cyclic ether formation in alkanes ranging in size from C2 to C5.

The present model is composed of a C0\u2013C4 base module from literature and a DEE module. For the low-temperature oxidation mechanism, the reactions of ROO and QOOH radicals were studied previously with a quantum-chemical and transition state theory approach by Sakai et al. (2015). In the present study, the potential energy surfaces for the unimolecular reactions of OOQOOH isomers and 1- and 2-ethoxyethyl radicals were determined with a CBSQB3 composite method. In the presence of an OOH group, the reaction barrier of the hydrogen shift from the \u03b2 site (terminal carbon atom) decreases as it does in alkane oxidation but there is no effect on the hydrogen shift from the \u03b1 site (next to the ether oxygen atom). Therefore, the reaction barriers of OOQOOH isomers have the same trend as the corresponding ROO radical and rate constants for the reactions of OOQOOH isomers were determined. The constructed model was validated against the recent data of ignition delay times provided in literature by Werler et al. (2015). The agreement is good over the temperature range 500\u20131300\u00a0K and pressure range 1\u201340\u00a0bar, although, open questions remain regarding the non-consensus at 900\u20131150\u00a0K and 40\u00a0bar.

Both 2,5-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene and the new low temperature precursor 3-methylbut-3-enyl nitrite were used to generate 2-methylallyl radicals under these conditions. Rate coefficients were obtained for dissociation of the precursors, recombination of 2-methylallyl, and dissociation of 2-methylallyl by simulation of the LS profiles. The experiments are complemented by a priori theoretical calculations for both the recombination and dissociation of 2-methylallyl. The experimental results and theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with one another. The calculated high pressure limit rate coefficient for recombination of 2-methylallyl is log(k1)\u00a0=\u00a014.737\u22120.641logT+251.39/(2.303\u00d7T) and that for dissociation of 2-methylallyl is log(k3)\u00a0=\u00a011.100\u22121.2295logT\u221228545/(2.303\u00d7T). The uncertainties in k1 and k3 are estimated as factors of 1.5. Rate coefficients are provided over a broad range of pressures for chemical kinetic modeling.",

     "abstract": "The reaction of atomic oxygen with ethylene is a fundamental oxidation step in combustion and is prototypical of reactions in which oxygen adds to double bonds. For 3O+C2H4 and for this class of reactions generally, decomposition of the initial adduct via spin-allowed reaction channels on the triplet surface competes with intersystem crossing (ISC) and a set of spin-forbidden reaction channels on the ground-state singlet surface. The two surfaces share some bimolecular products but feature different intermediates, pathways, and transition states. The overall product branching is therefore a sensitive function of the ISC rate. The 3O+C2H4 reaction has been extensively studied, but previous experimental work has not provided detailed branching information at elevated temperatures, while previous theoretical studies have employed empirical treatments of ISC. Here we predict the kinetics of 3O+C2H4 using an ab initio transition state theory based master equation (AITSTME) approach that includes an a priori description of ISC. Specifically, the ISC rate is calculated using Landau\u2013Zener statistical theory, consideration of the four lowest-energy electronic states, and a direct classical trajectory study of the product branching immediately after ISC. The present theoretical results are largely in good agreement with existing low-temperature experimental kinetics and molecular beam studies. Good agreement is also found with past theoretical work, with the notable exception of the predicted product branching at elevated temperatures. Above \u223c1000\u00a0K, we predict CH2CHO+H and CH2+CH2O as the major products, which differs from the room temperature preference for CH3+HCO (which is assumed to remain at higher temperatures in some models) and from the prediction of a previous detailed master equation study.",

Noting that different conformers will undergo different types of H-migration reactions, the mechanism of conformational change may impact the distribution of cyclohexyl and the branched cyclohexyl radical isomers during cyclohexane and alkyl cyclohexanes combustion. Consequently, it will influence the formation of subsequent decomposition products. In this work, the conformational inversion-topomerization mechanism and H-migration reactions for six ethylcyclohexyl radical isomers were systematically studied by ab initio calculations and the transition state theory. The updated sub-mechanism of these conformational changes is incorporated into an ethylcyclohexane pyrolysis model. By comparing the simulated results of the \u201ccomplete\u201d model including the sub-mechanism of conformational changes and the simplified model ignoring these processes, the effect of inversion-topomerization mechanism on the relative concentrations of various ethylcyclohexyl radicals and the formation of subsequent decomposition products were revealed.",

     "abstract": "A substantial fraction of the reactions that take place in combustion are complex-forming (i.e. pressure-dependent) reactions, which depend on the collisional energy transfer characteristics of the surrounding mixture (\u201cbath gas\u201d). In contrast to the single-component bath gases used in nearly all fundamental investigations of these reactions, significant fractions of multiple species of disparate collisional energy transfer characteristics are usually present in combustion environments. Calculations of the rate constant for multi-component mixtures thereafter inevitably relies on a \u201cmixture rule\u201d based on rate constants for the individual single-component bath gases. Failure to implement a mixture rule, which is actually quite common in many implementations of kinetic models within combustion codes, can yield errors up to a factor equal to the number of separate expressions for each component. Even still, as demonstrated herein, rate constants evaluated through various proposed mixture rules can differ by over 60% for exactly the mixture compositions of interest to combustion modeling. Therefore, evaluating the suitability of various mixture rules for accurately representing multi-component pressure dependence for combustion modeling purposes appears particularly worthwhile, given that these differences now exceed achievable accuracies for single-component bath gases and, additionally, given that inverse uncertainty quantification procedures almost always rely on starting with an accurate model structure, including mixture rules. The present study evaluates various existing and new mixture rules for representations of multi-component pressure dependence for H+O2(+M)=HO2(+M) through comparison with master equation calculations. The results indicate that mixture rules based on the reduced pressure provide a considerably more accurate description than those based on pressure (reaching accuracies of 2% compared to \u223c60%). Recommendations are made for incorporation of these new mixture rules within combustion codes. Until then, potential errors in the full condition-dependence for H+O2(+M)=HO2(+M) of up to \u223c90% are essentially unavoidable merely due to available representation options within combustion codes.",

     "abstract": "High-temperature methyl acetate (MA) pyrolysis and oxidation were studied behind reflected shock waves using laser-absorption species time-history measurements of CO, CO2, OH and H2O. The shock tube experiments with very dilute fuel mixtures covered a temperature range of 1401\u20131605\u00a0K for MA pyrolysis (0.2% MA/Ar) and 1423\u20131674\u00a0K for MA oxidation (0.4% O2, \u03d5\u00a0=\u00a01), and pressures around 1.5\u00a0atm. The dominant sensitivity of CO2 concentration to MA unimolecular decomposition reactions enabled accurate determination of the rate coefficient and dissociation branching ratio by monitoring the CO2 time-history during MA pyrolysis. A recent kinetic mechanism developed by Yang et al. [13] originally for interpreting flow reactor and low-pressure flame data was adopted to simulate and compare with the current shock tube data. The measured CO and CO2 time-histories during MA pyrolysis were both well-predicted by the modified Yang et al. [13] mechanism. A relatively complete description of MA oxidation behavior was given by measuring CO, CO2, OH and H2O time-histories at the same temperature and pressure (1480\u00a0K, 1.5\u00a0atm). A unique two-stage CO2 formation during MA oxidation was clearly observed in the measured CO2 time-histories over the entire temperature range, with the rapid pre-ignition CO2 formation analyzed to be associated with the initial MA dissociation. Despite the overprediction of MA ignition delay times by 18\u201340% between 1623 and 1423\u00a0K, the kinetic model successfully captures the plateau levels and the peak values of all the measured species profiles, as well as simulates the characteristic two-stage formation of CO2 observed experimentally.",

It also appears as a byproduct during the combustion of methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE) which is used as octane enhancer in gasolines.

Three deuterated isotopes, isobutene-1-d2 (D2CC(CH3)2), isobutene-3-d6 (H2CC(CD3)2) and isobutene-d8 (D2CC(CD3)2) were employed to elucidate branching ratios of the allylic and vinylic H-abstraction from isobutene by OH radicals. H-abstraction from the allylic sites was found to be dominant and constituted about 75% of the total rate in the entire temperature range of the current work.

Both surrogates adequately captured the measured ignition delay times of light naphtha under shock tube conditions. However, for low-temperature RCM conditions, simulations with the multi-component surrogate showed better agreement with experimental data.

Comparison of the reactivity of EF with that of 2-methyl furan (MF) and 2, 5-dimethyl furan (DMF) under various equivalence ratios was conducted and results show that the relative reactivity of the three furanic fuels depends complicatedly on both equivalence ratio and temperature, which was further interpreted by examining the ignition kinetics.

From reaction flux analyses, the reactions involving alkyl side chains of alkylfurans are analogous with those of alkylbenzenes at low to intermediate temperature oxidation conditions. Moreover, large amount of alkylfurans go through OH-addition reactions on the ring, which is not observed in the reaction pathways of alkylbenzenes.",

The formation of these agents has been investigated in an atmospheric-pressure jet-stirred reactor during the low-temperature oxidation of n-pentane (initial fuel mole fraction of 0.01, residence time of 2\u00a0s) using three different diagnostics: time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with tunable synchrotron photoionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with laser photoionization, and cw-cavity ring-down spectroscopy. These three diagnostics enable a combined analysis of H2O2, C1\u2013C2, and C5 alkylhydroperoxides, C3\u2013C5 alkenylhydroperoxides, and C5 alkylhydroperoxides including a carbonyl function (ketohydroperoxides). Results using both types of mass spectrometry are compared for the stoichiometric mixture. Formation data are presented at equivalence ratios from 0.5 to 2 for these peroxides and of two oxygenated products, ketene and pentanediones, which are not usually analyzed during jet-stirred reactor oxidation. The formation of alkenylhydroperoxides during alkane oxidation is followed for the first time. A recently developed model of n-pentane oxidation aids discussion of the kinetics of these products and of proposed pathways for C3\u2013C5 alkenylhydroperoxides and the pentanediones.",

     "abstract": "This work investigates the thermodynamic and chemical kinetic behavior of the lower stationary point, denoted as the lower turnover state, of the NTC curve near the low temperature regime, where the ignition delay exhibits a local minimum. It is found that the ignition delay varies Arrheniusly with the turnover temperature under various pressures, and that the turnover temperature, Tlower, and the initial pressure, P0, are related and can be correlated by another Arrhenius dependence, as P0 \u223c exp(\u2212Ea/Tlower). These two behaviors have been systematically investigated using detailed mechanisms for typical n-alkanes exhibiting NTC, namely n-butane and n-heptane. It is found that the first and second stage ignition delays are approximately equal to each other at the lower turnover states under various pressures, such that the total ignition delay shares similar temperature dependence with the first stage ignition delay. To further characterize the second ignition stage, the cool flame temperature rise at the end of the first stage is investigated and shown to decrease linearly with increasing initial temperature. A crossover temperature is then defined at the state where the cool flame temperature rise disappears. This state can be correlated with a constant \u03b1, which denotes the ratio between OH production from the low-temperature chemistry and the total fuel consumption. It is shown that the second stage ignition delay correlates well with the reaction rate constant for the H2O2 decomposition. Analytical expressions are then derived based on these kinetic insights on the two stages, which well reproduce the lower turnover temperature under different pressures and provide further insights into the two-stage ignition at the turnover states. Comparison of the present results with the literature experimental data of the n-heptane ignition delay time shows good agreement.",

Mole fraction profiles of 17 intermediates including aromatic compounds such as toluene, styrene and ethylbenzene were quantified. A detailed kinetic mechanism involving 295 species and 1830 reactions was established to predict the oxidation of C2H2 and formation of PAH. In developing the mechanism, particular attention was paid to reactions of the vinyl radical and to steps involved in the sequence C2H2\u2192iC4H5\u2192fulvene\u2192C5H5CH2\u2192C6H6. In general, the peak concentrations of intermediates gradually increase and peak locations tend to shift toward high temperatures with \u03a6 increasing. Flux analysis indicates that the addition of H and the reaction with O are the two major channels governing C2H2 consumption. At temperatures below 1000\u00a0K, benzene is mainly formed through the C2+C4 channels:C2H2+iC4H5\u2192fulvene\u2192C5H5CH2 isomers\u2192C6H6.The C1+C5 pathway: CH3+C5H5\u2192C5H5CH3\u2192(fulvene and C5H5CH2 radicals)\u2192C6H6 tends to be the dominant route for benzene formation at temperatures above 1000\u00a0K.

This model was used to highlight the specificities of the oxidation chemistry of long chain aldehydes and to understand the formation routes of the C5 and C6 low-temperature oxidation products.

     "abstract": "In Rapid Compression Machines (RCM), several phenomena can induce inhomogeneities inside the reaction chamber. The benefits of using a creviced piston have been largely demonstrated through good agreement with the widely used adiabatic core assumption. Still, temperature inhomogeneities due to wall heat transfer cannot be avoided. These induce spatial variations in terms of chemical composition, potentially affecting the auto-ignition process. Mass transfer to the crevices during two-stage ignition is also a phenomenon that can influence the ignition process. In this study, we quantify the impact of multi-dimensional effects on the auto-ignition of the iso-octane by comparing 0-D and RANS simulations of the Argonne RCM. A detailed kinetic mechanism is employed, which makes this study the first to couple an accurate description of both the physical and chemical phenomena in an RCM context for such a complex fuel. It is found that the influence of the inhomogeneities on the ignition delay is globally marginal except for the lowest temperature condition explored where the diffusive transport of intermediate species and radicals plays a key role. The effect of mass transfer to the crevices does not affect significantly the auto-ignition delay under the test conditions. The sensitivity of the results to the turbulence level is also assessed and the results indicate that turbulence may only exert a minor influence on the auto-ignition delay. Comparison with the experimental data is good, and RANS simulation results are similar to those of the 0-D simulations.",

A reliable and simple approach for the description of aldehydes low temperature oxidation is proposed based on fundamental studies available in the literature, previous high temperature kinetic studies and acetaldehyde low temperature cool flames. The high reactivity of the weakly bound aldehydic H-atom leads to the predominant formation of carbonyl radicals. While acetyl-radical addition to oxygen is a key step in the low temperature reactivity of acetaldehyde, heavier carbonyl radicals are rapidly decomposed to CO and alkyl radicals. Therefore, the observed reactivity of C3\u2013C4 aldehydes is ruled by the well established low temperature branching pathways of the corresponding alkyl radicals. Based on these assumptions, a comparison of the relative reactivity of alkanes and aldehydes is also discussed. The approach and the kinetic mechanism here presented are supported by several comparisons with experimental data in Jet Stirred Reactor, and allow easy extension to heavier aldehydes.",

This permits the additional assessment of the importance of pressure-dependent kinetics in predicting species concentration profiles. A recently published literature model Bugler et al.

Furthermore, the ignition temperatures of o-xylene are lower than those of m- and p-xylenes, and are suggested to be due to the formation of dimethylphenyl radicals with isolated H abstraction sites, which react with O2 for further chain branching.

In this work a detailed chemical kinetic model for the combustion and pyrolysis of mustard gas is proposed for the first time. A large number of thermo-kinetic parameters were calculated using quantum chemistry and reaction rate theory. The model was validated against experimental pyrolysis data of the literature. It was shown that the degradation of mustard gas is ruled by a chain reaction mechanism where the chlorine atom is the principal chain carrier. HS radical, formed in the primary mechanism by an original pathway found using quantum calculations, was also proved to be an important chain carrier. Comparison with the kinetics of the usual simulant of mustard gas, diethyl sulfide, showed that the lack of chlorine atom in the former chemical leads to an inappropriate simulation of the mustard gas behavior. Combustion and pyrolysis simulations were also compared and surprisingly demonstrated that chlorine atoms remain the main chain carrier in combustion.",

     "abstract": "Using accurate multi-component diffusion treatment in numerical combustion studies remains formidable due to the computational cost associated with solving for diffusion velocities. To obtain the diffusion velocities, for low density gases, one needs to solve the Stefan\u2013Maxwell equations along with the zero diffusion flux criteria, which scales as O ( N 3 ) , when solved exactly. In this paper, we propose an accurate, fast, direct and robust algorithm to compute multi-component diffusion velocities. We also take into account the Soret effect, while computing the multi-component diffusion velocities. To our knowledge, this is the first provably accurate algorithm (the solution can be obtained up to an arbitrary degree of precision) scaling at a computational complexity of O ( N ) in finite precision. The key idea involves leveraging the fact that the matrix of the reciprocal of the binary diffusivities, V, is low rank, with its rank being independent of the number of species involved. The low rank representation of matrix V is computed in a fast manner at a computational complexity of O ( N ) and the Sherman\u2013Morrison\u2013Woodbury formula is used to solve for the diffusion velocities at a computational complexity of O ( N ) . Rigorous proofs and numerical benchmarks illustrate the low rank property of the matrix V and scaling of the algorithm.",

Experimentally measured speciation profiles are also important targets for surrogate fuel kinetic models. This work presents the low- and high-temperature oxidation of two alkane-rich FACE gasolines (A and C, Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) in a jet-stirred reactor at 10\u00a0bar and equivalence ratios from 0.5 to 2 by probe sampling combined with gas chromatography and Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectrometry analysis. Detailed speciation profiles as a function of temperature are presented and compared to understand the combustion chemistry of these two real fuels. Simulations were conducted using three surrogates (i.e., FGA2, FGC2, and FRF 84), which have similar physical and chemical properties as the two gasolines. The experimental results reveal that the reactivity and major product distributions of these two alkane-rich FACE fuels are very similar, indicating that they have similar global reactivity despite their different compositions. The simulation results using all the surrogates capture the two-stage oxidation behavior of the two FACE gasolines, but the extent of low temperature reactivity is over-predicted. The simulations were analyzed, with a focus on the n-heptane and n-butane sub-mechanisms, to help direct the future model development and surrogate fuel formulation strategies.",

     "abstract": "The formation and destruction pathways of the formyl radical (HCO) occupy a pivotal role in the conversion of fuel molecules (and their intermediates) to eventual products CO and CO2, and therefore, HCO has been a prescient indicator for heat release in combustion. In this work, we have characterized the impact of including non-equilibrium effects for HCO, i.e. \u201cprompt\u201d dissociation of HCO to H\u00a0+\u00a0CO, in simulations of laminar flame speeds for archetypal hydrocarbon and oxygenated molecules relevant to combustion. Prompt dissociation probabilities for HCO were systematically applied to all elementary reactions that included this radical (as either a product or reactant) in literature combustion kinetics models. Simulations with the prompt HCO dissociation corrected models predicted a 7\u201313% increase in laminar flame speeds at 1\u00a0atm for the fuels characterized here (CH4, n-C7H16, CH3OH, CH3OCH3) relative to the predictions using the original models. It is evident that simulations of other fuel-air flames at 1\u00a0atm will be similarly impacted, suggesting the indispensability of incorporating these non-equilibrium effects for predictive flame modeling. Simulations of higher pressure (10\u00a0atm) heptane-air flames predicted a more modest effect (<\u00a05%) of incorporating these non-equilibrium effects. Additionally, species profiles in low-pressure (0.03\u00a0atm) flames of CH2O and auto-ignition delay simulations (1.4\u00a0atm) for CH2OO2Ar mixtures were also impacted to a noticeable extent. Lastly, it is also worth noting that prompt dissociations are a ubiquitous feature of all weakly-bound radicals; the kinetics of many of which (C2H3, C2H5, CH3O, CH2OH, etc.) are central to our current understanding of combustion chemistry. Theory/modeling studies are in progress to address the relevance of prompt dissociations in these weakly-bound radicals to combustion modeling.",

The variable reaction coordinate TST (VRC-TST) approach was employed to obtain high pressure limit rates for barrierless channels, including C7H7\u00a0+\u00a0CH3, C6H5\u00a0+\u00a0C2H5, C6H5CHCH3\u00a0+\u00a0H, and C6H5CH2CH2\u00a0+\u00a0H. Interaction potentials between each pair of fragments were simply simulated with CASPT2/cc-pVDZ calculations and scaled by reference to QCISD(T)/CBS energies. The larger basis set, cc-pVTZ, was tested to have only a very limited improvement on the final kinetics. For benzyl\u00a0+\u00a0CH3 recombination, addition to benzylic-site forming ethylbenzene dominates overwhelmingly over addition to ortho- and para-sites forming o-methylbenzyl and p-methylbenzyl, respectively. For C6H5CHCH3\u00a0+\u00a0H recombination, addition to benzylic-site also dominates over addition to sites at the aromatic ring. Present predictions, from a theoretical perspective, demonstrate strong preference for the CC dominance in ethylbenzene decomposition. The quite good agreement with earlier studies lend confidence to present predictions. More importantly, our kinetic predictions imply that it could probably introduce large uncertainties if simply using kinetic parameterizations of toluene in modeling study of larger alkylbenzenes. The ethylbenzene system should serve as a better and safer reference.",

In addition, using knowledge of bond dissociation energies in the molecules and possible decomposition products, an explanation for the observed trends in reactivity is given. The trend in reactivity is found to be the same for both 20 and 40\u00a0bar ignition delay times, and follows the trend: 3-pentanone > butanone > 2-pentanone > acetone.

     "abstract": "Unimolecular decompositions of acyclic ethers through a pericyclic mechanism, i.e., alcohol elimination, have been shown to play a crucial role in the high-temperature combustion of these compounds. The production of new fuels derived from biomass has led to a renewed interest into the combustion chemistry of ethers. A large fraction of ethers produced as potential biofuels features a cyclic structure. The pericyclic reactions in these cyclic structures, with or without a lateral alkyl group, remains unknown. In this work, we performed a systematic theoretical study on the pericyclic reactions in acyclic and cyclic ethers. Envisaged concerted reactions includes the classical alcohol formation and a H2 eliminations that was recently shown to play a non negligible role in the thermal decomposition of tetrahydrofuran (Verdicchio et al., 2015). Theoretical calculations performed in this work demonstrated that H2 elimination in acyclic ethers is negligible. In the case of cyclic ethers (tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran), the branching ratio of the unimolecular pericyclic reactions strongly depends on the presence of a lateral alkyl group bonded to the carbon atom in position 2. If an alkyl group is present, the alcohol formation is favored through an exo 4-center rearrangement, that we newly defined in this work. If no lateral alkyl group is available in position 2, endo alcohol formation and H2 eliminations are equivalently important. Reaction rate rules were established to include pericyclic decomposition reactions in detailed chemical kinetic models of ether combustion.",

     "abstract": "Multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS) is used to determine branching fractions of conjugate alkenes from R\u00a0+\u00a0O2 oxidation reactions for cyclohexane (c-C6H12) and tetrahydropyran (c-C5H10O), a lignocellulosic-derived oxygenated biofuel. Because conjugate alkene formation is coincident with the formation of HO2, the results reveal the temperature- and pressure-dependent influence of the oxygen heteroatom on chain-termination propensity. The experiments were conducted using Cl-initiated oxidation at 10 and 1520\u00a0Torr and from 500 to 700\u00a0K, and ab initio calculations of bond energies, saddle point energies, and rate coefficients of unimolecular decomposition of \u03b1-tetrahydropyranyl were conducted to complement the experiments.Relative to the initial radical concentration [R]0 the trend in conjugate alkene branching fraction exhibits monotonic positive temperature dependence in both cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran, except for the latter species at 10\u00a0Torr where increasing the temperature to 700\u00a0K caused an appreciable decrease. The decrease in the branching fraction with increasing temperature in tetrahydropyran oxidation occurs because ring-opening rates of \u03b1-tetrahydropyranyl radicals, enabled by weak C\u2013O bond dissociation energies, exceed rates of O2-addition. Ring-opening rate coefficients for \u03b1-tetrahydropyranyl, computed from stationary points at the CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-PVDZ//M06-2X/6-311++G** level of theory, confirm that ring-opening at 700\u00a0K is favorable and higher oxygen concentrations are required for O2-addition rates to be significant. With increased temperature and lower [O2], \u03b1-tetrahydropyranyl radicals preferentially undergo unimolecular decomposition into the linear radical C \u02d9 H 2 ( C H 2 ) 3 CHO . Conjugate alkene branching fractions measured at 1520\u00a0Torr for both cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran followed monotonic positive temperature dependence. The change in the tetrahydropyran trend at 1520 Torr relative to the 10\u00a0Torr measurements is ascribed to the increase in oxygen concentration mitigating ring-opening reactions of the initial R radicals.In contrast to the results at higher temperature, where ring-opening of tetrahydropyranyl radicals interrupts R\u00a0+\u00a0O2 chemistry and reduces the formation of conjugate alkenes, branching fractions measured below 700\u00a0K were higher in tetrahydropyran compared to cyclohexane at 10\u00a0Torr. The difference suggests that the ether group renders chain-termination pathways more-facile. Saddle point energy calculations on the surfaces of equatorial ROO conformers reveal that the barrier height to direct HO2 formation from \u03b1-tetrahydropyranylperoxy is lower by ca. 5\u00a0kcal/mol compared to cyclohexylperoxy at the CBS-QB3 level of theory, which facilitates low-temperature chain-termination.",

     "abstract": "A new on-the-fly mechanism reduction method is presented for dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC), in which chemical species are categorized into active, directly coupled, and inconsequential species through time-scale and Jacobian-aided rate analysis (TSRA) with given instantaneous local composition. Chemistry integration is simplified by solving only parts of species with the inconsequential species being treated frozen. The method applies intuitive error control on species rates-of-change for the active species and requires no problem-dependent parameters such as starting species. In addition, it can guarantee element conservation and directly take transport flux into account for chemistry reduction. The new method has been validated in auto-ignition, unsteady perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) and 1-D flame propagation of methane/air mixture with the 53-species GRI-Mech 3.0 and n-heptane/air mixture with the 561-species LLNL mechanism. It shows that the proposed Jacobian analysis can successfully identify important low-concentration slowly-varying intermediate species as active species during the ignition process. Compared to directed relation graph (DRG) based DAC, TSRA yields more accurate predictions of ignition delay time and composition together with slight improvement in efficiency for methane/air auto-ignition. For the n-heptane/air mixture, TSRA accurately reproduces the challenging two-stage ignition and negative temperature coefficients over a wide range of pressures and initial temperatures. The importance of transport flux on dynamic reduction is investigated in unsteady PSR, showing that TSRA dynamically adjusts the local mechanism size with the relative significance of chemical reaction and it offers greater reduction in regions where transport processes are significant. The 1-D flame propagation validates the generality of TSRA method for inhomogeneous reacting flows. Results also show that TSRA has effective and more universal error control. For TSRA, a single threshold \u03b5\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0\u2212\u00a04 applies to all the tests considered. In contrast, the appropriate reduction threshold for DRG is problem-dependent.",

The so-called Reaction-Diffusion Manifold (REDIM) method is employed for this purpose. The problem statement represents a fundamental difficulty for manifolds based model reduction concepts, since it is necessary to account for flame-wall interactions that perturb the system states by heat loss and catalytic reactions. Omitting the latter still leaves the task to find a reduced description, that is valid not only for flames experiencing heat loss in a stationary burning regime, but also in a transient regime, where flame quenching occurs. It is shown that the REDIM method is capable to account for these processes. The application of the approach is illustrated by the methane/air combustion system in a simple geometry with a cold inert wall, but with a detailed chemical reaction mechanism.",

The methodology has very important advantages over other reduction strategies, namely, a very low dimensionality of the resulting reduced model and a high accuracy of the results. In the present study the problem of model reduction of premixed combustion systems is discussed. The method of Reaction\u2013Diffusion Manifolds (REDIM) is further developed to handle generically high dimensional reduced models. Three main problems of manifold based model reduction strategies were in the focus of the study: the generation of manifolds of arbitrary dimension, the definition of the manifold domain for the specific problem and the independence of a priori information from detailed calculations. Hierarchical structure of the manifold with respect to dimensionality together with a natural geometrical observation that the manifold should degenerate on its boundary allow us to overcome the first two problems for this type of model reduction. A simple but meaningful example of a syngas/air system is used to illustrate the insensitivity of the reduced model with respect to detailed system information, i.e., detailed system gradients. To validate the reduced model the relaxation process of perturbed flame profiles is investigated. The results of comparison of the reduced and detailed transient solutions show a great potential for the suggested methodology to handle the premixed combustion systems.",

So far, applications used a gradient estimate taken from simple combustion scenarios, like one-dimensional flame simulations.

In this work, we study how gradients from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a turbulent flame can be incorporated into the REDIM method. A method for analyzing scalar gradients from a DNS simulation, and for representing them in a form that is usable in the REDIM method, is presented and applied. The analysis reveals a hierarchical structure in the local gradient directions of different scalars, which enables construction of gradient estimates on different levels of complexity (and fidelity). It is shown how these different levels appear in the dissipation terms of the REDIM equation. The influence of varying the detail of the DNS-based gradient estimate is studied, and it is found that the addition of the more complex levels has minor influence only on the REDIM. It can have an influence, however, onto the dynamics of the combustion system on the REDIM, i.e., onto the trajectory that the system takes on the REDIM.",

However, the rate parameters of combustion models are intrinsically correlated and therefore uncertainty analysis methods are needed that can handle such parameters. A generalized HDMR method is presented here, which uses the Rosenblatt transformation on a correlated model parameter sample to obtain a sample of independent parameters. The method provides a full set of both correlated and marginal sensitivity indices. Ignition delay times predicted by an optimized hydrogen\u2013air combustion model in stoichiometric mixtures near the three explosion limits are investigated with this new global sensitivity analysis tool. The sensitivity indices which account for all the correlated effects of the rate parameters are shown to dominate uncertainties in the model output. However, these correlated indices mask the individual influence of parameters. The final marginal uncorrelated sensitivity indices for individual parameters better indicate the change of importance of homogeneous gas phase and species wall-loss reactions as the pressure is increased from above the first explosion limit to above the third limit. However, these uncorrelated indices are small and whilst they provide insights into the dominant chemical and physical processes of the model over the range of conditions studied, the correlations between parameters have a very significant effect. The implications of this result on model tuning will be discussed.",

Available published data is summary statistics in terms of nominal values and error bars of the rate coefficient of this reaction at a number of temperature values obtained from shock-tube experiments. Our approach relies on generating data, in this case OH concentration profiles, consistent with the given summary statistics, using Approximate Bayesian Computation methods and a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. The approach permits the forward propagation of parametric uncertainty through the computational model in a manner that is consistent with the published statistics. A consensus joint posterior on the parameters is obtained by pooling the posterior parameter densities given each consistent data set. To expedite this process, we construct efficient surrogates for the OH concentration using a combination of Pad\u00e9 and polynomial approximants. These surrogate models adequately represent forward model observables and their dependence on input parameters and are computationally efficient to allow their use in the Bayesian inference procedure. We also utilize Gauss\u2013Hermite quadrature with Gaussian proposal probability density functions for moment computation resulting in orders of magnitude speedup in data likelihood evaluation. Despite the strong non-linearity in the model, the consistent data sets all result in nearly Gaussian conditional parameter probability density functions. The technique also accounts for nuisance parameters in the form of Arrhenius parameters of other rate coefficients with prescribed uncertainty. The resulting pooled parameter probability density function is propagated through stoichiometric hydrogen\u2013air auto-ignition computations to illustrate the need to account for correlation among the Arrhenius rate parameters of one reaction and across rate parameters of different reactions.",

Uncertainty minimization using experimental measurements can reduce the uncertainty space of the rate coefficients of elementary reactions, and further reduce the uncertainties of model predictions.

In this work, \u201csensitivity entropy\u201d is proposed as a measure of the degree of dispersion of uncertainty sources of a model output. The smaller the sensitivity entropy is, the lower degree of dispersion of uncertainty sources will be. The experimental measurement of a target which has smaller sensitivity entropy will be more efficient for the uncertainty minimization. To illustrate the practicability of using sensitivity entropy to guide the selection of relatively efficient experimental systems for specific targets for model uncertainty minimization, the methanol/O2/Ar laminar premixed flame system is investigated. Based on the analysis of sensitivity entropy, two experiments in which many targets have small sensitivity entropies are designed.

Experiments were conducted in the high-pressure combustion chamber that had been used previously for high-pressure soot formation studies in laminar diffusion flames. Either toluene or n-heptane was added to the methane such that 7.5% of the total carbon would be from the liquid fuel so that the results could be used to infer the pressure dependence of sooting propensities of the two liquid fuels. Pressure range was from atmospheric to 8 atm for methane and methane+n-heptane flames, whereas for methane+toluene mixture it was from atmospheric to 6\u00a0atm. A constant carbon mass flow rate of 0.41\u00a0mg/s for the three fuels was maintained at all pressures to have tractable measurements. Visible flame heights, as marked by the luminous soot radiation, were constant at all pressures except for methane at 1\u00a0atm. Variation of the maximum soot volume fractions, maximum soot yields, and the line-of-sight averaged soot temperatures of the three flames, pure methane, toluene-doped methane, and n-heptane-doped methane, with pressure were evaluated from soot spectral emission measurements which were collected line-of-sight but converted to radially-resolved values by using an Abel type inversion algorithm assuming axisymmetry of the laminar diffusion flames. Maximum soot volume fractions and maximum soot yields in n-heptane- and toluene-doped flames showed the higher sooting propensity of toluene in comparison to n-heptane at elevated pressures. Sooting propensity, in terms of both maximum soot yield and maximum soot volume fraction, of the methane+toulene flame displayed a relatively weaker dependence on pressure as compared to those of methane and methane+n-heptane mixture.",

This work used a high resolution differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and an atmospheric pressure interface-mass spectrometer (APi-TOF) to observe incipient particle formation during flame synthesis. By tandemly applying these two instruments, differential mobility analysis-mass spectrometry (DMA-MS) measured the size and mass of the incipient particles simultaneously, and the effective density of the sub 3 nm particles was estimated. The APi-TOF further provided the chemical compositions of the detected particles based on highly accurate masses and isotope distributions.

The present article reports detailed numerical simulations of a planar vortex interacting with a sooting laminar diffusion flame formed by a parallel flow of acetylene and air. Calculations are carried out to reproduce the experimental data reported by Cetegen and Basu (2006). Compared to previous numerical works on this configuration based on simple two-equations soot models, a detailed numerical mechanism, accounting for 97 gaseous species and 59 solid BINs, is considered here to represent the chemistry in the gas phase and the production and oxidation of soot particles. Three different vortex strengths are considered and vortices are formed by pulsing the air or the fuel streams, allowing comparisons between the calculated soot-vortex-flame interactions with LII images. Calculations adequately retrieve experimental data when the vortex is initiated at the fuel side. Differences are observed when the vortex is formed on the air side. The simulations, however, are useful for examining strain rate and curvature effects on soot volume fractions of small spherical particles and large aggregates, and to study physical processes underlying the soot production. It is shown that the variability of the soot volume fraction is highly correlated to the response of soot precursors to flame curvature. Soot variability in the mixture fraction space depends on the behavior of large aggregates that, being characterized by high Schmidt numbers, are more sensitive to the convective motion imposed by the vortex compared to the gaseous phase. The observed behavior has to be reproduced by the models developed for numerical simulations in order to obtain an accurate prediction of soot production in turbulent flames.",

In particular, the variation of thermal emissivity is showed to take up with a variation of hydrogen percentage and optical bandgap.Data also evidence that oxidation has a severe role in affecting both the determination by TPD of soot emissivity and soot concentration.

Soot volume fraction and temperature measurements from different laboratories and optical techniques are used for validation. Then, acoustic forcing is applied to investigate the transient behavior of this multi-dimensional combustion problem. Forcing at different frequencies and amplitudes provokes very distinct transient soot, temperature, and flow conditions. The discussed steady ethylene-air flame is excited with 20 and 40\u00a0Hz, corresponding to Strouhal numbers of 0.23 and 0.46. For both frequencies, forcing amplitudes of 20, 50, and 60% are studied numerically and validated against measurements at 50%. With a start-up transient analysis, the computation time to reach a periodic state is evaluated and soot volume fraction predictions are then compared with the measurements. A reduction in maximum soot volume fraction for the increased forcing frequency is observed experimentally and numerically. The decrease in maximum soot volume fraction is explained by a residence time analysis revealing shorter maximum fluid parcel residence times for the 40\u00a0Hz than for the 20\u00a0Hz case. It is also found that at 40\u00a0Hz the transient evolution of maximum soot production and forced fuel velocity is almost synchronized, while for the 20\u00a0Hz case, a time lag of 32.5\u00a0ms is observed, corresponding to 65% of a full period.",

The method of moments is widely-used for the statistical modeling of aerosol dynamics in various applications, and a number of different moment methods have been established and successfully applied to the modeling of soot formation and growth. However, a shortcoming of existing moment methods is the lack of an accurate, numerically robust, and computationally efficient way to treat soot oxidation, especially regarding the prediction of the particle number density. In this work, the recently developed Extended Quadrature Method of Moments (EQMOM) is integrated with a physico-chemical soot model and combined with a treatment for particle removal by oxidation. This leads to a modeling framework for the simulation of coupled inception, growth, coagulation, and oxidation of soot in flames. In EQMOM, the moment equations are closed by reconstructing the soot NDF with a superposition of continuous kernel functions. Various standard distribution functions can be used as kernel functions, and the algorithm has been implemented here using gamma and lognormal distributions. It is shown that and discussed why gamma distributions are more suitable as kernel functions than lognormal distributions in order to accurately predict soot oxidation.

Mass spectra and photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves of soot precursor species were measured at different heights in a premixed flat flame and in a counter-flow diffusion flame fueled by ethylene and oxygen. The PIE curves at the pyrene mass from these flames were compared with reference PIE scans recorded for pyrene. The results demonstrate that other C16H10 isomers than pyrene are major components among species condensed onto incipient soot in this study, which is in agreement with the simulations. Species with mass 202\u00a0u only have a high prevalence in incipient soot particles drawn from the premixed flame, but hydrocarbon species with sizes in the range 200\u2013400\u00a0u are important to incipient-soot formation in both flames. The simulations predict that some species form through combination reactions involving relatively large radicals and bypass traditional molecular-growth pathways through addition of small hydrocarbon species. The experimental results support this prediction; they demonstrate that these species have higher relative abundances in particles formed close to the fuel outlet than smaller, lighter molecular species and indicate that these species are important to early formation of incipient-soot precursors.

The maximum soot volume fraction in the recirculation zone and jet-like region of the ethylene/hydrogen case are significantly lower than that of the ethylene case. Flamelet calculations demonstrated that hydrogen addition suppressed soot formation due to the reduction of the C/H ratio, resulting in an estimated fourfold reduction in soot volume fraction due to chemical effects. Soot reduction in the downstream jet-like region of the flame is quantitatively consistent with this chemical effect. However, soot reduction in the recirculation zone is substantially larger than this analysis suggests, indicating an additional hydrodynamic effect. Large Eddy Simulation was used to further investigate soot evolution in the recirculation zone and to elucidate the role of hydrogen addition. For the same heat release rate and similar jet Reynolds number as the neat ethylene case, the addition of hydrogen requires a higher jet velocity, and this leads to a leaner recirculation zone that inhibits soot formation and promotes soot oxidation.",

We have drawn the following conclusions: 1) the chemistry of oxygenated compounds (specifically the high concentrations of O2 and OH) is critical to reproduce the experiments; 2) using free energy simulations, we found out that the tendency of molecules to form dimers is mainly affected by the molecular shape rather than the mass of the aggregate. Finally we propose a different mechanism for the growth of soot precursors based on radical\u2013radical recombination to form molecules of high molecular masses (>1200\u00a0u). These structures are then likely to promote physical aggregation to further the growth mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Acetylene is one of the most important precursors of soot and contributes to soot growth by the hydrogen-abstraction acetylene-addition (HACA) mechanism. In this work, we undertake time-resolved simultaneous measurements of acetylene and soot behind reflected shock waves at temperatures of 1600\u20132200\u00a0K and pressures of 3\u20135\u00a0bar. Acetylene mole fraction time-histories are measured from the absorption of a quantum-cascade laser operating around 13.6\u00a0\u00b5m. The soot volume fraction, particle size and number densities are calculated from the extinction and scattering of a cw Nd:Yag laser at 532\u00a0nm. Acetylene and soot are generated from the pyrolysis of 1% benzene in argon, 2.35% ethylene in argon, and binary mixtures of ethylene with propane/methane in argon. We note that acetylene time-histories exhibit a two-stage growth during the pyrolysis of benzene, which can be correlated to the initial rapid increase of soot volume fraction and a later plateauing. In comparison to ethylene pyrolysis, the pyrolysis of benzene results in larger values of the soot volume fraction, particle diameter and number density. We compare the measured data against the values simulated using the method-of-moments routine in Chemkin-Pro and a detailed PAH mechanism based on KM2 [1] and AramcoMech 1.3 [2]. Large discrepancies are observed between the measured and predicted values of the soot parameters. The data obtained from our experiments may assist future validation and development of soot mechanisms.",

The oxidation mode (surface vs. internal), and rate, was measured for individual primary particles, demonstrating that mature primary particles primarily oxidize through surface reactions. Further experiments with less mature soot particles showed oxygen permeation into the core of the primary particles, causing internal oxidation, as well as surface reactions, demonstrating a link between soot ageing and the oxidation mode. Aggregate structural changes and fragmentation throughout oxidation were also characterized; with surface reactions weakening the bridges between primary particles until the aggregate breaks up. In the last stages of aggregate oxidation, the primary particles were seen to lose their graphitic shell and spherical nature, with the remaining disordered carbon reforming into large amorphous masses before burning away. The role of ionized oxygen species on oxidation rates is also discussed, and showed a strong dependence on electron beam voltage.",

The investigation contained seven salts, where we in this work mainly focus on two of these salts, potassium chloride (KCl) and iron chloride (FeCl3), as these for mature soot resulted in the largest reduction and highest increase in soot concentration, respectively. The optical measurements show that the potassium chloride significantly reduces the build-up of larger soot precursors and also decreases the sizes of the primary soot particles both at the nucleation stage as well as for more mature soot later in the formation process. This is also confirmed by analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, which clearly show smaller primary soot particles for the potassium chloride-seeded flame. The iron chloride-seeded flames were found to have marginal influence on the primary particle sizes based on the optical data, although somewhat more irregular shapes could be observed in TEM images.",

Specifically, we have measured spatially resolved two-dimensional soot volume fraction distributions for three large hydrocarbons: 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (tipb), 1,3,5-triisopropylcyclohexane (tipcx), and perhydrophenanthrene (php), as well as benzene and n-hexane. Measurements were performed in methane/air coflowing flames whose fuel was doped separately with these compounds (dopant mass fraction 0.5%). Color-ratio pyrometry was used to measure soot temperature and soot volume fraction distributions. Sooting tendencies were tipb > benzene > php > tipcx > hexane. These data are expected to be useful in formulation of surrogates with greater fidelity to the volatility and sooting characteristics of real diesel, and in validation of numerical soot models involving such surrogates.",

Particular attention was paid to verify the validity of the probe-sampling technique. Results showed that the particle size distributions (PSD) were strongly affected by sample dilution immediately after extraction. Within the flame, the soot PSD did not become independent of dilution ratio until the sample was diluted several thousand times (depending on initial concentration) within a few milliseconds of extraction. A method for on-line measurement of dilution ratio was also introduced by measuring CO2 concentration continuously during the tests.High spatially resolved experimental results at different heights (typically 1\u00a0mm apart) along the central axis of the flame showed the evolution of PSD for particles larger than 2\u00a0nm covering early nucleation and growth to oxidation regions. Moving upward from the fuel-side, prior to the visible flame, the PSD in the particle nucleation region was bimodal (with one of the modes being smaller than 2\u00a0nm) and gradually turned into a unimodal PSD with a median of 10\u00a0nm due to particle growth. Nearer to the visible flame, the PSD became bimodal again with the larger-diameter mode growing in magnitude and being made up of ever-larger particles, while the smaller-diameter mode gradually shrunk in size until it vanished. Eventually, as the flow was leaving the visible flame, all the particles gradually oxidized until at the tip of the flame they reached a median diameter of 9\u00a0nm and in very low concentrations.",

Measurements are reported of the mean, instantaneous, and radially integrated SVF, together with soot intermittency, for all three flames. They reveal an inverse relationship between the exit strain rate and all of the aforementioned quantities. This observation is consistent with previous trends reported both in laminar flames and turbulent flames, although this is the first systematic assessment for flames that are also well-suited to model validation. The probability density functions of maximum instantaneous SVF exhibit similar trends with regards to exit strain rate, although the most probable SVF increases with decreasing exit strain. The volume integrated SVF reveals an inverse relationship with the exit strain rate, which can be characterized by an exponential fit. A linear correlation was also found between the exit strain rate and the maximum instantaneous SVF, the maximum mean SVF, and the total soot volume per flow rate of fuel.",

     "abstract": "An experimental study is performed to investigate the feasibility of conducting simultaneous mixture fraction, soot volume fraction and velocity imaging in sooting jet flames. The measurements are performed in the soot-inception region of ethylene jet flames, where the yellow luminous region first appears in the flame. Three-component velocity and soot volume fraction are measured by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry and laser-induced incandescence, respectively. The mixture fraction is inferred from laser-induced fluorescence of krypton gas seeded into the fuel stream. To obtain mixture fraction from the fluorescence signal, the signal must be corrected for density and fluorescence quenching effects. This correction is accomplished by invoking an assumed state relationship that is derived from a laminar strained-flame calculation. Once properly calibrated, the krypton planar laser-induced fluorescence data give the mixture fraction, temperature and major species near the regions of soot formation. The krypton is seeded into the fuel jet at a mole fraction of approximately 4%. The fluorescence of krypton is achieved by two-photon absorption at 214.7\u00a0nm and the resulting fluorescence is collected at 760.2\u00a0nm. The krypton fluorescence signal is rather weak, particularly near the reaction zones where density is lowest, and so adequate signal-to-noise ratios could be achieved in a region only about 1\u00a0mm in height, which effectively limited this study to a line measurement of mixture fraction. The temperature field derived from the mixture fraction field was compared to temperatures obtained from thermocouple measurements. The mean radial temperature profiles using the different techniques show excellent agreement and this serves to validate the methodology used to map from fluorescence signal to mixture fraction and temperature. The resulting data are of high enough quality as to allow the investigation of the kinematics, thermo-chemical state and even the dissipation fields near regions of soot formation.",

Mole fraction profiles of 22 species, including reactants, intermediates, and products were identified by on-line GC analysis.

Rate constants of TMB124 decomposition, reaction with HO2, ipso-additions and metatheses with abstraction of methyl H-atom were updated. New pathways of H-abstraction from the 1- and 2-methyl groups were considered. The final model leads to an overall satisfactory agreement between the experimental observations and predictions for the major species and intermediates. Rate-of-production analysis indicates that the TMB124 consumption is dominated by metatheses giving three dimethyl benzyl radicals. From the sensitivity analysis, it is obvious that the reactions of HO2 radical and the three dimethyl benzyl radicals have promoting effect, while the H-abstraction reactions of TMB124 exhibit strong inhibiting effect. These results will enrich the understanding of low temperature chemistry of TMB124 and facilitate to further model development and validation.",

These calculations indicate a strong pressure dependence for the role of various Hydrogen-Abstraction-C2H2-Addition (HACA) sequences for the formation of naphthalene from benzene. At atmospheric and lower pressures the C8H7 radicals, C6H4C2H3 and C6H5C2H2, cannot be stabilized above 1650\u00a0K. As a result, both the Bittner\u2013Howard HACA route, in which a second acetylene molecule adds to C6H5C2H2, and the modified Frenklach route, where a second C2H2 adds to the aromatic ring of C6H4C2H3 obtained by internal hydrogen abstraction, are unrealistic under low pressure flame conditions. At the higher pressures of some practical combustion devices (e.g., 100\u00a0atm) these routes may be operative. Naphthalene is predicted to be the main product of the C6H5C2H2\u00a0+\u00a0C2H2 and C6H4C2H3\u00a0+\u00a0C2H2 reactions in the entire 500\u20132500\u00a0K temperature range independent of pressure (ignoring the issues related to the instability of C8H7 species). Frenklach's original HACA route, where the second C2H2 molecule adds to the aromatic ring activated by intermolecular H abstraction from C8H6, involves the C6H4C2H\u00a0+\u00a0C2H2 reaction, which is shown to predominantly form dehydrogenated species with a naphthalene core (naphthyl radicals or naphthynes) at T <\u00a02000\u00a0K and diethynylbenzene at higher temperatures. The temperature and pressure dependence of rate coefficients for the various reaction channels has been analyzed and the results clearly demonstrate the importance of pressure for the reaction outcome.

     "abstract": "Due to their low chemical time scales, the production of soot particles in turbulent diffusion flames is highly impacted by large range of local strain rate fluctuations.In order to understand the response of soot production to strain rate fluctuations, unsteady laminar counterflow diffusion flames with an imposed oscillating strain rate are investigated both analytically and numerically. First an analytical linearized model is developed to predict the unsteady response of a flame quantity of interest from information on laminar steady flames. Three critical parameters governing flame response are identified: the Stokes number which compares the characteristic time associated to the mean imposed strain rate to the oscillation frequency, the Damk\u00f6hler number associated to the quantity of interest, and a third one characterizing the response of this quantity to an imposed steady strain rate. This model is then applied to soot predictions. Parallely, the response of soot production in propane-air counterflow diffusion flames to unsteady strain harmonic oscillations is studied numerically using a detailed sectional soot model. A wide range of frequencies and amplitudes are considered. A specific trend is highlighted for soot precursors and particles production according to their respective chemical time scales: the bigger the PAH or soot particle, the higher its chemical time scale, resulting in a more damped and phase-lagged response. The particle size distribution evolves accordingly during the considered oscillations, so that the quasi-steady state behavior is not verified for high frequencies. The numerical results are compared to those obtained by the analytical approach and a very good agreement is obtained at low amplitudes. Non-linear response of soot precursors and soot particles production to strain oscillations are finally discussed in case of high oscillation amplitudes and the limits of the proposed analytical model are identified.",

     "abstract": "Given the recent EURO 6 regulations, which include limits on particle number density (and hence size) for soot emissions from land vehicles, soot models must be capable of accurately predicting soot particle sizes. Previous modeling work has demonstrated the importance of the relative strengths of nucleation and condensation in predicting soot primary particle size. Due to this importance, a fundamental reversible model for nucleation and condensation, called the reversible PAH clustering (RPC) model, was developed in previous work through the use of statistical mechanics and the results from several recent works.In the present work, the RPC model is enhanced to include multiple nucleation (or dimerization) events from 6 different PAH size groups, resulting in 21 unique dimer pairs. In addition, a soot PAH tracking model is developed to track the amount of each PAH size group within soot particles. The addition of this model resulted in reduced computation times and the ability to investigate PAH-PAH reactions within soot particles. The results of the enhanced RPC model demonstrate that smaller PAHs are most important for the nucleation process, while small and large PAHs are important for the condensation process. These results are shown to be due to the relatively lower reversibility of condensation versus the nucleation process. These findings are discussed in light of recent experimental results in the literature and are shown to be well supported.",

We provide mole fraction profiles of 47 components as function of distance from the fuel outlet and compare them to chemically detailed modeling results. To this end, the hierarchically developed model described by Seidel et al. [16] has been updated to accurately comprise the chemistry of 1,3-butadiene. Generally a very good agreement is observed between the experimental and modeling data, allowing for a meaningful reaction path analysis. With regard to the formation of aromatic species up to naphthalene, it was essential to improve the fulvene and the C5 chemistry description in the mechanism. In particular, benzene is found to be formed mainly via fulvene through the reactions of the C4H5 isomers with C2H2. The n-C4H5 radical reacts with CH3 forming 1,3-pentadiene (C5H8), which is subsequently oxidized to form the naphthalene precursor cyclopentadienyl (C5H5). Oxidation of naphthalene is predicted to be a contributor to the formation of phenylacetylene (C8H6), indicating that consumption reactions can be of similar importance as molecular growth reactions.",

A previously published, atom-pair minimization algorithm was used to optimize the geometries of the PAH stacks and clusters. HOMO\u2013LUMO gaps decrease with an increase in monomer size; homogeneous stacks and clusters indicate substantial lowering of the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap because of agglomeration effects with the formation of dimers and formation of clusters (two or more stacks) being the most dominant contributions. Heteromolecular particulates had HOMO\u2013LUMO gaps that were strongly influenced by the larger components in the system. The HOMO\u2013LUMO gaps of homogeneous clusters approached a maximum agglomeration effect because of the localization of electronic interactions among adjacent stacks.

Their reaction with ethylene leads to formation of the four-ring phenalenyl-type radical benz[de]anthracenyl, which reacts with the principal alkenes and arylmethyl radicals in the system to produce several five- to seven-ring peri-condensed benzenoid PAH.

Laser-induced incandescence and light scattering have been proven to measure the primary soot particle size as well in atmospheric flames; however, using these two techniques for the purpose of primary soot particle sizing in diffusion flames at elevated pressures has been found to be problematic. One of the popular methods of studying soot morphology and primary size in atmospheric flames is thermophoretic sampling followed by transmission electron microscopy analysis. A high pressure thermophoretic sampling system was built and used successfully to measure the size of primary soot particles in laminar diffusion flames of methane at pressures above atmospheric. The multi-probe sampling system was fitted inside the high-pressure combustion chamber that had been used previously for high-pressure soot formation studies. Soot samples taken at various pressures were analyzed subsequently by transmission electron microscopy to estimate the primary soot particle sizes. The soot volume fractions and soot temperatures were measured by spectral soot emission technique at the same height above the burner rim as the thermophoretic sampling. The mean primary soot particle size, measured at a constant height from the burner exit at all pressures, decreased about 35% from 2 to 10\u00a0atm whereas the soot volume fraction increased by a factor of more than 50. Experimental results of mean primary soot sizes and the corresponding soot volume fractions imply that the number of soot nuclei in soot inception region of the laminar diffusion flames must have a strong sensitivity to pressure. The higher amounts of soot are mainly determined by the increasing nucleation leading to higher primary soot particle number densities as the pressure is increased.",

In lab scale reactors and flames, DMF showed different sooting tendencies depending on the combustion conditions.In this work a new sampling system has been setup to measure particle size distribution (PSD) in premixed flames at atmospheric pressure doped with DMF, from non-sooting to fully sooting conditions to better understand the particle evolution in a wide range of combustion conditions. PSDs of neat ethylene/air flames measured with the current setup are in agreement with those present in literature.Overall, experimental results show that the use of DMF reduces significantly the amount of large particles produced, reducing the total mass of particles emitted. However, DMF is not reducing significantly the number concentration of particles smaller than 10 nm. Their contribution to the total mass is insignificant whereas they dominate the number PSDs. The current findings are in agreement with recent optical measurements performed in the same conditions. Although a systematic kinetic study of gas phase by-product was not possible due to lack of experimental data for the gas phase, this effect has been attributed to some oxidation pathways particularly favored in the investigated conditions that subtracts carbon from the molecular growth, thus explaining the reduced amount for particles formed in the DMF flames.",

While the 3936 SMPS may detect particles with a mobility diameter of 3\u2013150\u00a0nm, DEG SMPS can be used to measure incipient soot particles of 1\u201310\u00a0nm. We found that the minimum diameter of the incipient soot particles appeared at \u223c1.5\u00a0nm (though with some uncertainty caused by the classification device). A complete bimodality of the PSDFs was observed quantitatively when the burner-to-stagnation surface separation distance (Hp) was greater than 0.6\u00a0cm. Characterized by a lognormal distribution, the first peak appears to be relatively stable at different Hp, with the geometric standard deviation varying from 1.1 to 1.3 and the peak diameter ranging from 1.9 to 2.9\u00a0nm. The absolute number density of particles no bigger than the first peak diameter was found to be positively related to the first peak diameter and the geometric mean diameter of these particles.",

Two types of existing standards include material evaluation by pass/fail criteria corresponding to Test 1 of NASA STD 6001B and evaluation by a flammability index such as maximum oxygen concentration (MOC) corresponding to the improved Test 1. The advantage of the latter is the wide applicability of the MOC index to different atmospheres in spacecraft. Additionally, the limiting oxygen index (LOI) method is introduced as a potential alternative index for the evaluation using the improved Test 1 method. When criteria based on an index such as MOC or LOI are applied for material screening, the discrepancy of the index to the actual flammability limit in microgravity such as minimum limiting oxygen concentration (MLOC) is essential information for guaranteeing fire safety in space because material flammability can be higher in microgravity. In this paper, the existing research on the effects of significant parameters on material flammability in microgravity are introduced, and the difference between the limiting value in microgravity and the indices given by the standard test methods on the ground is discussed.

     "abstract": "This paper presents the first comprehensive experimental study on the dynamical behaviors of small scale buoyant pool fires under imposed circulation before the formation of fire whirls. A rotating screen facility was used for experiments. It was found that as the screen rotated slowly, the original vertical buoyant pool fire inclined with a certain angle (\u03b1) and revolved around the facility central axis steadily. The deviation of the flow field from axial symmetry is proved to be induced by the additional Coriolis force in the rotating coordinates. A correlation is proposed to couple the tangent of inclination angle to the screen angular speed and fire characteristics. The correlation agrees well with the experimental data in this work. The flame revolution was entirely dominated by aerodynamics and its angular speed was strictly equal to that of the rotating screen. It was found that the inclined flame surface was steady at the base and the oscillation was originated at a higher position due to suppression of vorticity generation. The nominal averaged pulsation frequency of the inclined flame was always larger than that of the free buoyant fire. The flame inclination and the change of pulsation mode can affect the flame heights and lengths significantly. At a critical screen angular speed, the inclined flame became vertical again with self-swirling and the fire whirl formed finally.",

Ethanol and heptane are used as representative fuels producing typically less-sooty and sooty flames. Results show that the overall conduction heat feedback flux through the four sides increases with cross air flow speed, being more prominent for smaller pools than for larger ones. And the rate of overall conduction heat feedback increment is more prominent for heptane, of which the rate of increase with flow speed nearly 2 times that of ethanol. Meanwhile, the radiation heat feedback declines with cross air flow speed, with its contribution fraction nearly negligible at larger flow speeds for both fuels. The convection feedback fraction increases with cross air flow speed. Its increment is more prominent (a) for heptane (increasing fast with flow speed to be even the dominate one among the three heat feedbacks) than ethanol (increasing slowly with flow speed; being nearly constant and maintaining to be the dominant one); and (b) for larger pools than for smaller ones. The changing of dominant heat feedback mechanism with cross air flows, results in the change of the scaling behavior of the mass burning flux with pool size. A stagnant layer solution theory is then proposed, by including fuel mass transfer Spalding number B, to describe the change of mass burning flux of different size pool fires with cross air flow speed for different fuels in relative strong cross air flows [as indicated by Froude number (Fr\u00a0=\u00a0u/[gd]1/2) larger than about unity].

The model is based on the perfectly stirred reactor concept, thereby assuming rapid reactant mixing in the reaction zone, where reactants are delivered at stoichiometric proportions. Model simplicity is achieved by considering the single-step global reaction model. Advancing previous studies, we demonstrate that this model is able to replicate critical strain rates at extinctions of both counter- and co-flow flames in a range of experimental configurations including opposed gaseous streams and evaporating liquid pool with a normally impinging oxidizer stream, in the entire range of gaseous diluent concentration enabling flaming combustion. The model correctly predicts the minimum extinguishing concentrations of different inert diluents (argon, nitrogen, water vapor and carbon dioxide) used in practice of fire suppression. The algorithm is simple and computationally affordable enough to be incorporated in a CFD fire model. A worked example is demonstrated in simulations of flame suppression by sprinkler sprays at different water flow rates. The proposed algorithm can be used for any practical fuel, as soon as the global kinetic model of fuel oxidation is calibrated using the procedure developed in this work.",

By extension of the Reynold\u2019s Analogy, it is hypothesized that the non-dimensional temperature gradient at the surface of a condensed fuel is related to the local mass-burning rate through some constant of proportionality. First, this proportionality is tested by using a validated numerical model for a steady flame established over a condensed fuel surface, under free and forced convective conditions. Second, the relationship is tested by conducting experiments in a free-convective environment (vertical wall) using methanol and ethanol as liquid fuels and PMMA as a solid fuel, where a detailed temperature profile is mapped during steady burning using fine-wire thermocouples mounted to a precision two-axis traverse mechanism. The results from the present study suggests that there is indeed a unique correlation between the mass burning rates of liquid/solid fuels and the temperature gradients at the fuel surface. The correlating factor depends upon the Spalding mass transfer number and gas-phase thermo-physical properties and works in the prediction of both integrated as well as local variations of the mass burning rate as a function of non-dimensional temperature gradient. Additional results from precise measurements of the thermal field are also presented.",

     "abstract": "Most flammability tests for a material to be used for manned spacecraft are conducted on the ground, although several studies have reported that the flammability limit in microgravity is different from that in normal gravity. Hence, an important task is to predict the margin between the limiting oxygen concentrations (LOCs) in normal gravity and microgravity. We set up a simplified scale model to describe the opposed-flow flame spread over a thin material and derived expressions for the Damk\u00f6hler number (Da) and the nondimensional radiative loss factor (Rrad) for the flame spread over a thermally thin poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheet. The empirical constants for these nondimensional numbers were evaluated by fitting with the experimental results in a N2 balance. The obtained model was validated under varying gas-phase properties. First, we obtained the experimental blow-off limits via downward spread tests in normal gravity with different balance gases (N2, Ar, and CO2). We compared the predicted blow-off limits, which corresponded to the limiting oxygen index (LOI) condition, with the experimental results for each balance condition and found that the predicted limits agreed well quantitatively with the experimental results. Then, using Da and Rrad, we drew a flammability map for opposed-flow flame spread over a thin PMMA sheet, which predicted the flammable conditions under the LOI. The developed simplified model predicted the minimum LOCs (MLOCs) and the critical opposed-flow velocity for the N2, Ar, and CO2 balance conditions. The model underestimated the MLOCs because it considered the effect of either the radiation or the kinetics, whereas both these effects are actually coupled near the MLOC. Nevertheless, the predicted margin between the MLOC and the LOI illustrated the behavior of the flame spread near extinction.",

The oxidizer is a mixture of 35% oxygen and 65% nitrogen. The fuel and oxidizer velocities are systematically varied. The analysis of the data shows that the streamwise location of the maximum flame height can be considered an unambiguous characteristic length of the flame as opposed to the maximum visible flame length. Analysis of the streamwise location of the maximum flame height enables to establish the transition between \u201copen-tip\u201d and \u201cclosed-tip\u201d behavior as well as scaling laws for the soot volume fraction.

It emerged that the flame height and puffing frequency declined with decreasing gravity, whereas the puffing phenomenon which occurred with fuel pan size rose with decreasing gravity. The puffing phenomenon was suppressed with decreasing gravity and the puffing frequency under low-gravity environments was summarized by the relationship between the Strouhal-and Froude numbers.

     "abstract": "The experimental study on the flame spread in partially premixed atmospheres was presented. Two samples of different filter thickness and density were used. Gaseous fuels of hydrogen, methane, and propane were added in the opposed air, focusing on the fuel Lewis number (Le). In the partially premixed atmospheres, the pyrolysis zone and the region of high temperature are expanded. Since the flame temperature is increased, the heat transfer rate to the preheat zone of the filter is promoted, which is confirmed by the de Ris\u2019s formula of the thermally thin model. The heat transfer due to the heat conduction from the flame is 60\u201380% of total heat transfer. By comparing the results of the preheated air, the corresponding temperature rise caused by fuel addition is evaluated. For all fuels, the linear increase of temperature rise with the fuel concentration (Cf) is confirmed. However, at the fixed fuel concentration, the temperature rise depends on the fuel type. Generally, there are two factors directly related with thermal structure of combustion field such as the flame temperature. One is the heat of combustion (H), and the other is the fuel Lewis number, because the opposed flow is the lean mixture. Since Le is proportional to the inverse of the fuel diffusivity, the temperature rise could be corrected by 1/Le. Resultantly, for all fuels, the temperature rise collapses to a single curve with the correlation of (Cf\u00a0\u2217\u00a0H/Le). Thus, the Lewis number is a very important and useful parameter to discuss the thermal structure and the flame spread rate in partially premixed atmospheres.",

Polyethylene (PE) insulated copper (Cu) wires with inner core diameter (dc) of 0.30\u00a0mm, 0.50\u00a0mm 0.80\u00a0mm and insulation thickness (\u03b4p) of 0.15\u00a0mm, 0.30\u00a0mm are studied with inclination angles ranged from \u221290\u00b0 to +90\u00b0.

Results show that with increase in inclination angles from \u221290\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, the FSR first decreases and then increases (\u201cU\u201d trend) with its value being lowest at nearly horizontal condition (0\u00b0) in both pressures, which is quite different from what we normally know for other materials with low thermal conductivity. Two characteristic lengths, the flame base width (Wf) and the pyrolysis zone length (Lp), are found to account for this special variation behavior with their variation trend with inclination angle being consistent with that of FSR. A simplified heat balance analysis concerning core thermal conduction effect is performed to calculate the FSR in relation to these two characteristic lengths, thermal conductivity of the metal core as well as the effective convection heating of the wire by the flame base. The calculated FSR are shown to be in fairly good agreement with the measured values at different inclination angles for different inner core (wire) diameters in both ambient pressures.",

A reduced-scale model (about 1:4) of a compartment fire with a facade wall has been constructed where the window dimensions and the separation distance between them varied during the experiments. The flames ejected from the windows were recorded by a CCD camera. The excess heat release of the fuel burning outside the windows was high enough to produce flames controlled by three-dimensional entrainment. Temperatures inside the compartment, the flame merging probability, the distance from neutral plane to flame lowest merging point, and the height of the facade flames before and during merging were measured. The temperature measurements inside the under-ventilated compartment fires do not change with total heat release rate or the window separation distance, thus indicating that the same heat is produced inside the compartments. The flame merging probability and the flame merging point distance are normalized and well correlated using the facade flame height for completely non-merging flames and the separation distance between the windows. Finally, the facade flame height normalized by the facade flame height for completely non-merging flames is well correlated with the ratio of surface of the air entrained between the windows as the separation distance changes divided by the total surface area from all sides available for entrainment. For the present case this ratio is a function of the ratio of the flame merging point distance over the facade flame height for completely non-merging flames which is finally used for the correlation of merging flame heights.",

The flame spread rate as a function of initial pressure has been measured for a given fuel and found to vary as \u223cP2 in agreement with Grashof number scaling. The burning rate per unit area for a fixed pressure has been shown to be a constant independent of fuel area density or quantity of fuel burned. A steady upward flame spread was observed only at low pressure. The pressure rise in a sealed chamber has been shown to scale with the quantity of fuel burned, and the peak pressure has been shown to scale inversely with initial pressure, in agreement with the pressure dependence of the characteristic time associated with a simple analytical solution of an energy balance. The pressure rise per mass of fuel burned exhibits an exponential decay with burn-time, also in agreement with the analytical solution.",

     "abstract": "In opposed-flow flame spread over thermally thin solid fuels, an increase in flow velocity eventually leads to flame extinguishment. While the chemical time is independent of the flow velocity, the residence time of the oxidizer at the flame leading edge is inversely proportional to the flow velocity. A competition between the two leads to a situation where finite-rate kinetics dominates the flame spread behavior, leading to blow-off extinguishment. The ratio of the two competing, the Damkohler number, captures this finite-rate effect and has been used to correlate the non-dimensional spread rate with opposing flow velocity and ambient oxygen level. Although qualitatively successful, these correlations show considerable spread in the data despite the use of several variations of the definition of the Damkohler number. One possible reason could be the neglect of the developing boundary layer in front of the flame by the experimentalists. In this work we present new flame spread data over ashless filter paper acquired in an eight meter tall vertical steel chamber, in which a sample is moved at desired velocities to create a relative opposing flow. The developing boundary layer over the fuel sample is shown to have a significant effect on the measured spread rate and flame shape that does not correlate with opposing flow velocity if an Oseen flow approximation is used. Once the data is adjusted for the developing boundary layer using an effective flow velocity formula obtained from scaling arguments and refined through computational results, the correlation improves drastically, establishing the importance of the boundary layer in the kinetic regime. Much of the thermally thin fuel spread rate data available in literature does not mention the development length and must be cautiously used.",

     "abstract": "A set of experiments on sidewall fires was conducted in a small-scale corridor-like structure. The mass loss rate, ceiling jet flame length and maximum ceiling jet temperature were investigated by correlating with the distance between fire source and ceiling. The results show that as the effective ceiling height decreases, the mass loss rate increases due to the enhanced radiation heat feedbacks from the ceiling and ceiling jet flame to the fuel surface. The mass loss rates are higher for the pans with long edge attaching sidewall compared to those with short edge attaching sidewall, due to the enhanced sidewall confinement effect. A simplified equation for predicting the mass loss rate per unit area is developed involving the dimensionless effective ceiling height and the length ratio of pan edges attached and perpendicular to the sidewall. Besides, a correlation is established between the dimensionless longitudinal length of ceiling jet flame and the dimensionless heat release rate by taking into account the effects of heat release rate, effective ceiling height, pan size and layout. The maximum ceiling jet temperature rise for intermittent flame hitting the ceiling can be expressed using the similar form as the McCaffrey\u2019s model. A modified correlation for the maximum ceiling jet temperature by taking into account the effect of the pan layout and the aspect ratio of the pan edges is proposed.",

Motivated by this application, infrared radiation from buoyant diffusion flames with and without impingement on a flat plate is studied using a quantitative comparison of measured and simulated images. The measured quantitative images of the radiation intensity are acquired using a calibrated high speed camera. Simulated radiation intensities are rendered in the form of images and compared quantitatively with the measured images. The simulated radiation intensities are obtained using the radiative transfer equation with local absorption coefficients evaluated using a narrowband radiation model. The instantaneous local species concentrations, soot volume fractions, and temperatures necessary for these simulations are calculated using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) version 6. The measured images reveal that the characteristic necking and bulging ( 7 Hz \u00b1 1 Hz ) of the free buoyant flame is suppressed to a large extent by impingement on the plate. The roll-up vortices in the impinging flame are much smaller than those in the free flame. The stagnation point boundary layer inferred from the computed images is thicker at some instances than that inferred from the measurements. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the measured and computed infrared images for both the free and the impinging fires reveal many similarities as well as differences useful for model evaluation.",

The experimental setups include fires in the open space, flush with a wall without ceiling, at the longitudinal centerline of a channel and flush with the sidewall of a channel. Results showed that the flame extending under the ceiling presented a circular shape when the fire is located at the longitudinal centerline of channel, whereas for fire placed flush with sidewall, it is a half ellipse. As heat release rate (HRR) increases, the long axes of the ellipse changes from perpendicular to the sidewall plane to parallel to it, resulting from the competition between air entrainment enhancement of generated vortices and air entrainment restriction of the corner structure above fire source. Additionally, the total flame extension as a lump of the vertical flame height and horizontal flame length is quantified using dimensional analysis. The total flame extensions for fire at the longitudinal centerline are proportional to 2/5 power of dimensionless heat release rate Q \u0307 H \u2217 , while for fire flush with sidewall, the total flame extensions in longitudinal and transverse directions are proportional to 1/2 and 2/5 power of Q \u0307 H \u2217 , respectively.

A two dimensional, steady computational model is used to generate the computational fields, which are compared to the experimental measurements. The measured peak value of CO2 compares quite well with the computational prediction, but the peak temperature measured is significantly lower than the computational peak temperature. The overall measure and computed fields are similar in shape and size. The flame spread rates also agree reasonably well.

The model solves the species, momentum, and energy conservation equations and includes heterogeneous chemical reactions. A previously developed 5-step reaction scheme for peat, including evaporation of water, is adopted to describe the drying, thermal and oxidative degradation during the smoldering combustion. The model predicts the transient temperature, species, and reaction profiles during ignition, spread, and extinction. The predicted smoldering thresholds related to the critical moisture and inorganic contents for ignition show a good agreement with the experimental results in the literature for a wide range of peat types and organic soils. The influences of the kinetic parameters, physical properties, and ignition protocol are investigated. This is the first time that a physics-based model of smoldering peat fires is developed, thus helping to understand this important natural and widespread phenomenon.",

The slopes of the fuel bed were varied within 0\u201330\u00b0 in experiments. The experimental data of heat flux, gas temperature and gas velocity are used to characterize the significant effect of convection cooling in fire spread. The natural convection (due to the temperature difference between the unburnt fuels and the ambient) and flame-induced convection (caused by the flame-induced inflow which produces pressure difference between the flame and the ambient) are investigated by experimental and computational analyses, in order to understand their respective contributions to pre-heating of unburnt fuels. The results indicate that both kinds of convection have effects of cooling on the unburnt fuels ahead of the flame front, but with different spatial influence ranges. Natural convection takes effect in a region from far field to near field (close to the flame), while flame-induced convection plays an important role within a region close to the flame. The convection cooling is dominated by natural convection under lower slope angles, with comparable intensity as compared to radiation loss, and is controlled by the mixed convection (the combination of natural convection and flame-induced convection) under higher slope angles. Additionally, the fire line contour has marked impact on the convection heating, and compared to a convex flame front, the convection heating induced by a linear flame front has a much shorter spatial range of influence on unburnt fuels.",

     "abstract": "In situ burning is a practical means of oil spill cleanup in icy conditions. This study considers one example of oil spill scenario: burning oil in an ice cavity. A new set of parameters to the classical problem of confined pool fires in vessels arises under these unique conditions. The icy walls of the cavity create a significant heat sink causing considerable lateral heat losses, especially for the small cavity sizes (5\u201310\u00a0cm). The melting of ice due to the heat from the flame causes the cavity geometry to change. Specifically, the diameter of the pool fire increases as the burning proceeds. This widening causes the fuel to stretch laterally thereby reducing its thickness at a faster rate. The melted ice water causes the oil layer to rise up, which causes the ullage (the distance from the oil surface to the top surface of ice block) to decrease. The reduction in the ullage and increase in the diameter counter-act the reduction in oil thickness due to the widening. This results in a strong coupling between the mass loss rate and the geometry change of the pool and cavity. To systematically explore this process, experiments were performed in cylindrical ice cavities of varying diameters. It was found that due to the cavity expansion the average mass loss rate of crude oil in the ice cavity is greater than the mass loss rate in a pan. For example, the mass loss rate of crude oil burning in a pan found to be 50% less than that of an ice cavity with similar initial diameter. A model was developed to estimate mass loss rates and efficiencies which are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. Extension of the model to larger sizes, comparable to realistic situation in the Arctic is discussed.",

     "abstract": "The ignition of natural combustible material by hot metal particles is an important fire ignition pathway by which wildland and urban spot fires are started. There are numerous cases reported of wild fires started by clashing power-lines or from sparks generated by machines or engines. Similarly there are many cases reported of industrial fires caused by grinding and welding sparks. In this work, the effect of metal type on the ability of hot metal particles to cause flaming ignition of powdered cellulose fuel beds is studied experimentally. The materials studied are stainless steel, aluminum, brass and copper. These metals are representative of clashing conductors (aluminum and copper) and those involved in machine friction and hot work such as welding (stainless steel and brass). Cellulose powder is used as a surrogate for natural fuel beds. Particles of various sizes from 2 to 11\u00a0mm in diameter are heated to various temperatures between 575 and 1100\u00a0\u00b0 C and dropped onto the fuel bed. The results show a hyperbolic relationship between particle size and temperature, with the larger particles requiring lower temperatures to ignite the cellulose than the smaller particles. For large particles of all the metals, the ignition boundary is not very sensitive to particle size. For small particles the ignition boundaries are similar for the different metals and sensitive to both energy and temperature. The thermal properties of the metal play a lesser role in determining ignition with exception of the energy release from melting when it occurs. It also appears that the controlling ignition mechanisms by large particles are different than those from the small particles. The former appears to be determined primarily by the particle surface temperature while the later by the particle energy and temperature.",

First, flammability limits of H2/air/steam mixtures at 100\u00a0kPa for 3 temperatures between 358 and 383\u00a0K. the flammability domain was marginally modified by increasing the temperature. The mixtures were not flammable for H2O mol%\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a055. The presence of water mist in initially dry H2/air mixtures at 100\u00a0kPa and 298\u00a0K did not shift the lower flammability limit as long as the droplets density number was below a critical value. The slight shift in the limit was essentially due to the saturated water vapor pressure. The effect of dispersed large droplets (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0200\u2013250\u00a0\u03bcm) on laminar H2/air flames was also marginal except when the droplet velocity is of the same order of magnitude as the flame speed in the same direction. Non-flammable H2/air/steam mixtures at 358\u00a0K and 383\u00a0K were made explosive by aspersion with cold water spray. However, the pressure increase was limited when ignition occurred for mixtures close to the flammability limit. In this case, the burned gas bubble was rapidly dragged downward by the spray. The water mist effect on the deflagration of H2/air mixtures were studied for various equivalence ratios. With droplets diameter <10\u00a0\u03bcm, the violence of explosion was mitigated except for lean mixtures in the domain where the combustion was not complete.

Halon 13001 (CF3I) is a possible candidate for unoccupied areas. However, there are very few fundamental data to help in validating its detailed kinetics mechanism. In this study, ignition delay time and laminar flame speed measurements of the effects of CF3I on CH4, C2H4, and C3H8 have been investigated for the first time. The ignition delay times were obtained in a shock tube with mixtures of fuel/O2/CF3I highly diluted in 98% argon (vol.), and the flame speeds were measured using an expanding, spherical flame. Results from the new experiments show a significant decrease in the laminar flame speed for small additions of suppressant. The effects on the ignition delay time are strongly dependent on the hydrocarbon: the ignition delay time of CH4 is significantly decreased by CF3I addition, while a significant increase in the ignition delay time was observed for the lowest temperatures investigated with C2H4. Ignition delay times for C3H8 were mostly unchanged, except for the lowest temperatures (below 1400\u00a0K) where a small decrease in the reactivity was observed. Compared to recent results obtained with CF3Br, CF3I showed a smaller suppressant effect under the conditions investigated. A detailed kinetics mechanism assembled from a C1\u2013C3 mechanism from NUI Galway and a CF3I sub-mechanism from NIST predicts well the results obtained in the shock tube with CH4 and C3H8.

A propane\u2013ethanol\u2013water mixture, prescribed for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aerosol can explosion simulator test, was used as the fuel. The time-dependent, two-dimensional numerical code, which includes a detailed kinetic model (up to 241 species and 3918 reactions), diffusive transport, and a gray-gas radiation model, revealed unique two-zone flame structure and predicted the minimum extinguishing concentration of agent when added to the air stream. Despite striking differences in the flame shape, the agent effects were similar to, but stronger than, those in microgravity flames studied previously (for two of the agents). The peak reactivity spot (i.e., reaction kernel) at the flame base stabilized a trailing flame, which was inclined inwardly by a buoyancy-induced entrainment flow. As the volume fraction of agent in the coflow (Xa) increased gradually: (1) the premixed-like reaction kernel weakened; (2) the flame base detached from the burner rim, oscillated (particularly for CF3Br), until finally, blowoff-type extinguishment occurred; (3) the calculated maximum flame temperature remained nearly constant (\u22481800\u00a0K) or mildly increased; and (4) the total heat release of the entire flame decreased (inhibited) for CF3Br but increased (enhanced) for the halon replacements. In the trailing flame with C2HF5, a two-zone flame structure (with two heat-release-rate peaks) developed: in the inner zone, H2O (a product of hydrocarbon\u2013O2 combustion and a fuel component) was converted further to HF and CF2O through exothermic reactions occurring in the outer zone, where exothermic reactions of the inhibitor also released heat; CO2 was formed in-between. Thus, addition of C2HF5 resulted in unusual (non-chain branching) reactions and increased total heat release (combustion enhancement) primarily in the trailing diffusion flame.",

     "abstract": "Thermal disposal of sewage sludge is likely to cause serious nitrogen related environmental pollution since it contains considerable amounts of nitrogen, the species of which are quite different from those in coal. Considering that lime (CaO) is a widely applied chemical conditioner for sewage sludge dewatering, this study investigated the catalytic role of conditioner CaO in nitrogen transformation during sewage sludge pyrolysis in a drop-tube/fixed-bed furnace at 873\u00a0K, 1073\u00a0K and 1273\u00a0K, respectively. Model compounds were also used to further clarify the mechanisms involved. According to the results, conditioner CaO increased the fraction of more stable protein-N as well as amine-N. The solid phase reactions produced CaCxNy, thus enhancing the nitrogen retention in char. Correspondingly, decreased relative ratio of nitrates-N/nitrites-N and oxygenated organics in sludge conditioning contributed to less NO emission. Meanwhile, conditioner CaO promoted the conversion of HCN to NH3, as well as the deamination of proteins, amine, and other N-containing compounds in tar and char, leading to increased NH3 generation. Subsequently, CaCx, the decomposition product of CaCxNy, captured NH3, driving down the final production of NH3. In addition, Ca(OH)2 hindered the transformation of nitrile-N in char to HCN, decreasing HCN generation. CaO reacted with HCN, further reducing its releasing amount. CaCxNy derived from different sources decomposed to produce a very large amount of N2. These indicate that reusing conditioner CaO is a promising strategy for reducing the productions of NOx precursors efficiently and increasing the formation of non-polluting N2 dramatically.",

The release of sulfur-containing gases from aliphatic sulfur greatly increases at 250\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas significant sulfur-containing gases are released from aromatic sulfur at relatively high temperatures of 350\u2013450\u00a0\u00b0C. It was also observed that the presence of sulphonic acid and thiophene in sludge does not significantly affect the release of sulfur-containing gases.",

     "abstract": "As concern over global climate change continues, the use of biomass as a substitute for coal is one method of reducing CO2 emissions. One of the primary problems with utilizing biomass in boilers originally designed to burn coal is burnout. Biomass particles cannot be economically ground to the fine particle size typical of coal particles, creating a problem for particle burnout. The impact of oxygen injection in a swirl-stabilized burner on particle burnout and NO emissions was investigated by measuring NO and LOI, as well as flame characteristics, including flame imaging, flame intensity, and flame temperature. The results showed that when a low momentum flow of pure (>99%) oxygen is introduced into the center of a swirl stabilized biomass flame, an inverted diffusion flame is produced with oxygen in the center and volatiles on the outside of the flame. This high intensity center flame is surrounded by a lower intensity turbulent air/volatiles flame. This high temperature inner flame can heat incoming particles more rapidly than a conventional air flame improving burnout and flame stabilization without increasing effluent NO as long as the center flame does not extend into and disturb the fuel rich recirculation zone. Oxygen injection can therefore be used to improve burnout without increasing NO formation.",

     "abstract": "Rates of gasification of lignite char were compared when gasification with CO2 was undertaken in a fluidised bed of either (i) an active Fe-based oxygen carrier used for chemical looping or (ii) inert sand. The kinetics of the gasification were found to be significantly faster in the presence of the oxygen carrier, especially at temperatures above 1123\u00a0K. An analytical solution assuming pseudo-binary diffusion of species was developed to account for external and internal mass transfer and for the effect of the looping agent. The model also included the effects of the evolution of the pore structure at different conversions. The results are compared with a full numerical model using the Stefan\u2013Maxwell equations. Excellent agreement was observed between the rates predicted by the two models and those observed experimentally at T\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a01123\u00a0K. At 1173\u00a0K, the pseudo-binary model predicted slightly higher rates than the full numerical solution. It was found that a significant share of the error of the predicted rates with the analytical solution was caused by an underestimation of intraparticle diffusional resistance rather than by assuming a pseudo-binary system external to the particle. Both models suggested that the presence of Fe2O3 led to an increase in the rate of gasification because of the rapid oxidation of CO by the oxygen carrier to CO2. This resulted in the removal of CO and maintained a higher mole fraction of CO2 in the mixture of gas around the particle of char, i.e. within the mass transfer boundary layer surrounding the particle. This effect was most prominent at \u223c20% conversion when (i) the surface area for reaction was a maximum and (ii) because of the accompanying increase in porosity, intraparticle resistance to gas mass transfer within the particle of char had fallen, compared with that in the initial particle.",

To promote the thermal efficiency of power plants, a low temperature economizer was installed at the inlet of electrostatic precipitator to collect the heat generated from flue gas. The low temperature economizer can reduce flue gas temperature, and then affect the operation of electrostatic precipitator. Therefore, this experiment was carried out to investigate the collection characteristics of this novel electrostatic precipitator on particulate matter. In addition, the distribution of trace elements in solid combustion residues was also studied. The results indicate that the low temperature economizer can markedly decrease the amount of particulate matter at the outlet of electrostatic precipitator. The collection efficiency of electrostatic precipitator on particulate matter is significantly improved by the low temperature economizer, whereby the collection efficiencies of PM2.5 and PM1.0 can reach 99.7% and 99.2%, respectively. Most of the trace elements remain in the fly ash collected by the electrostatic precipitator, and less than 10% remain in the bottom ash, but very rare emit from the electrostatic precipitator.

     "abstract": "CO2 adsorption with solid sorbents is one of the most promising options for post-combustion CO2 capture strategies. Typical post-combustion flue-gas conditions are CO2 1\u201315%\u00a0vol. and atmospheric pressure and the performances of solid sorbents under typical flue gas conditions have been poorly investigated. In that condition the CO2 uptake capacity is influenced primarily by material functionality effects rather than material pore metrics so materials with a distinctive surface chemistry (presence of activated surface atoms or sites) could find applications in adsorption technologies. Hence the sorbent selection became a key point because the materials should be convenient from the economic point of view but versatile in post-combustion conditions. Recent studies of CO2 adsorption on low-cost iron metal oxide surfaces strongly encourage the possible use of metal oxide as sorbents, but the tendency of magnetite particles to agglomerate causes a lowering of CO2 uptake capacity. The dispersion of magnetite nanoparticles on carbonaceous matrix appears to be a promising strategy to overcome this shortcoming. This work investigates the adsorption behavior of CO2 on composite materials prepared coating a low-cost commercial carbon black (CB) with magnetite fine particles. The CO2 capture capacity of composites produced at different CB load was evaluated on the basis of the breakthrough times measured at atmospheric pressure and room temperature in a lab-scale fixed bed micro-reactor. A CB\u2013FM composite has been selected to verify the possibility of carrying out a two-stage operation and the thermochemical stability in a sound assisted fluidized bed. To this aim the reactor has been firstly operated for CO2 adsorption and then for regeneration. The effect of multiple cycles of adsorption and desorption steps has been also quantified.",

     "abstract": "Iron ore is a cheap and nontoxic oxygen carrier in chemical-looping combustion (CLC). However, it performs good recyclability while low reactivity in the CLC of solid fuels. Copper ore exhibits very high reactivity and oxygen uncoupling behavior, while suffers from tendency towards sintering and agglomeration during consecutive redox cycles at a higher temperature (e.g., 900\u20131000\u00a0\u00b0C). In this work, mixtures of hematite and copper ore were used as oxygen carriers for CLC of syngas and coal. Through the isothermal redox experiments at 950\u00a0\u00b0C in a thermogravimetric analyzer, it is found that there are synergistic effects between iron ore and copper ore, and copper ore could be more efficiently utilized when the mixing ratio of copper ore is maintained 10\u201320\u00a0wt%. As the mixing ratio of copper ore is 20\u00a0wt%, the reduction reaction of the mixer OC is no longer endothermic, which is beneficial to the controllability of the fuel-reactor temperature. The fluidized-bed experiments were carried out to verify the reactivity of the mixing ore OCs at 950\u00a0\u00b0C. It is observed that the mixing OC with 20\u00a0wt% copper ore has a better reactivity with the gasification products (especially H2) of low-volatile anthracite than the pure hematite, and leads to a higher fuel conversion rate and CO2 yield. The mixtures of iron ore and copper ore are expected to address simultaneously reactivity, recyclability, cost and environmental concerns of oxygen carriers.",

(1992). The large eddy simulation uses the Euler\u2013Lagrange framework for two-phase flows and relatively simple sub-models for the particle heat-up, devolatilisation, char combustion and radiation governing the pulverised coal combustion process are employed. The simulations yield improved predictions of the velocity statistics in the quarl region and result in a favourable agreement of the mean species profiles along the burner centreline compared with the measurements, while some temperature underprediction can be observed. Furthermore, the transient Euler\u2013Lagrange approach allows for a cross-comparison of the velocity and scalar statistics between the two phases and the comparison of the mean axial velocity and temperature shows the two phases to be near thermal and kinetic equilibrium along the burner axis. Individual particle time histories, which are crucial for the coal combustion sub-processes and overall flame stabilisation, are analysed.

Both gasification reactions kinetics followed a Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood (L\u2013H)-type equation.

Arsenic toxicity depends not only on the quantity but also on its speciation. At high temperatures, arsenic is predominantly present as vapors (As2O3(g)) and its speciation transformation is determined by the interactions between As2O3(g) and inorganic compounds. In this study, synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was used to investigate the speciation transformation of arsenic during MSW combustion and flue gas cooling process. However, arsenates in various forms are hardly distinguished by using XANES alone. Considering that various arsenates are of different thermal stability, the thermal stability of arsenic in MSW incineration fly ash was examined to provide detailed information regarding arsenic speciation in the ash samples. To further understand the relationships between arsenic and inorganic compounds, the sequential extraction procedures of arsenic in the ash were conducted. The results show that the oxidation of As2O3(g) during MSW combustion is incomplete and is continuously performed in flue gas cooling process. The physical adsorption of As2O3(g) is favored at low temperature by ash particles, especially by the injection of CaO in the flue gas. Various kinds of arsenates are formed due to the interactions between As2O3(g) and Ca, Fe and/or Al compounds. Some of the arsenates are thermally unstable and are decomposed when the fly ash was heated at 1323\u00a0K. Part of arsenic is stabilized in the ash matrix including some un-oxidized As(III) which remained stable even when the ash was heated at 1323\u00a0K.",

Using EGR, low engine-out NOx can be achieved, but at the expense of increased combustion variability at higher engine speeds. Initial motored tests at different speeds reveal that the in-cylinder gas flow becomes sufficiently strong at 2000\u00a0rpm to cause significant cycle-to-cycle variations of the spray penetration. Hence, the fired tests focus on operation at 2000\u00a0rpm with N2 dilution ([O2]\u00a0=\u00a019% and 21%) to simulate EGR. In-cylinder flow, spray, and early-flame measurements are correlated to reveal their effect on the combustion variability.Results reveal two types of flow/spray-interactions that predict the likelihood of a partial burn. (1) Proper flow direction before injection with a more collapsed spray leads to high kinetic energy of the flow during injection, thus generating a rapid early burn, which ensures complete combustion, regardless of the EGR level. (2) Improper flow direction and less collapsed spray generate low flow energy during the early phase of combustion. For this second type of flow/spray-interaction, application of EGR results in a partial-burn frequency of 30%, whereas without EGR, early combustion is shown to be insensitive to flow variations. Flame-probability maps illustrate that the partial-burn cycles for operation with EGR have a weak flame development in that the flame does not develop uniformly and reliably from the spark plug. Without EGR, the flame development is more repeatable regardless of the type of flow/spray-interaction, at the expense of higher NOx emissions.",

As droplets disperse, the cold-gas regions expand and relative temperatures as low as \u221250\u00a0K exist. Average temperature gradients between cold- and bulk-gases are up to 30\u00a0K/mm and gradients persist but drop in magnitude throughout compression as cold- and bulk-gases mix. Temperature stratification is greatest as the fuel disperses within the field-of-view producing large areas of cold-gases with relative temperatures as low as \u221250\u00a0K. Individual temperature images and 2D PDFs of identified cold-gas regions reveal that local regions of cold-gas imposed from evaporative cooling can last up to 30 CAD after fuel injection for the given operating conditions. The time-resolved imaging study show the mechanics of localized evaporative cooling and bulk-flow motion-driven mixing that over time reduces temperature gradients but does not completely homogenize the temperature fields.",

The four species examined \u2013 propane, propylene (propene), n-butane and iso-butane \u2013 are the primary constituents of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), and are also important intermediates in the oxidation of larger hydrocarbons. In-cylinder pressure data was acquired for both autoigniting and non-autoigniting engine operation at the same test conditions. The latter was used to calibrate a two-zone model of the CFR engine in a prior work, thus enabling the inclusion of the unburned charge chemical kinetics for further examination in this paper. The in-cylinder heat transfer and residual gas composition are both shown to affect autoignition significantly. In particular, physically reasonable concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) are found to be a strong promoter of autoignition in almost all cases, in keeping with several, more fundamental studies. The inclusion of NO in the residual gas is also required to obtain good agreement between the measured and modelled autoignition timing. This in turn suggests that kinetic interaction between hydrocarbon fuels and NO plays a vital role in octane rating, and its inclusion is important when modelling the autoignition of hydrocarbons in spark-ignition engines more generally.",

     "abstract": "Highly boosted spark ignition (SI) engines are more and more attractive for car manufacturers in terms of efficiency and CO 2 emissions. However, thermodynamic conditions encountered in these engines promote the occurrence of abnormal combustions like knock or super-knock, which are experimentally difficult to analyse due to the risks of engine damages. The Reynolds averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) method mainly used in industry for piston engines is not the most appropriate as knock does not always affect the mean cycle captured by RANS. Using an accurate LES compressible code and improved versions of ECFM-LES (Extended Coherent Flame Model) and TKI (Tabulated Kinetics of Ignition) models allowing a full uncoupling of flame propagation and auto-ignition reaction rates, this work demonstrates for the first time that LES is able to describe quantitatively knocking combustion in a realistic SI engine configuration. Contrary to previous studies (Fontanesi et al., 2013 [5]) (Lecocq et al., 2011 [4]), a quantified knock analysis is conducted based on a specific post-processing of both numerical and experimental data. LES is able to predict the in-cylinder pressure variability, the knock occurrence frequency and the mean knock onset crank angle for several spark timings. A 3D analysis also demonstrates that knock occurs at random locations, mainly at the exhaust valves side. Knock intensity is found proportional to the fresh gases mass burned by auto-ignition at low knock intensities, while an exponential increase at the highest intensities suggests the influence of additional factors like the knock location in the cylinder or complex behaviour of knocking combustion.",

By fully premixing the air\u2013fuel mixture upstream of the intake port, it was possible to create a fully premixed and pre-vaporized (PMPV) fuel\u2013air charge and to eliminate liquid fuel in-cylinder. A baseline particle size distribution (PSD) was demonstrated using multiple fuels including gasoline, methanol, and E100. The baseline particulate level was shown to be insensitive to fuel composition and equivalence ratio below a critical value of the equivalence ratio or C/O ratio ( \u03a6 c or C/Oc), indicating that the baseline PSD is not the result of fuel carbon, but instead is the result of other particulate sources, e.g., engine oil and engine wear particles. With the baseline particle levels established the PMPV technique was applied to determine the local enrichment needed to generate significant soot above the baseline particle size distribution. The critical equivalence ratio for onset of sooting under PMPV operation was determined to be between 1.345 and 1.349 (C/Oc\u00a0=\u00a00.461\u20130.462). The results, interpreted based on the literature on laboratory premixed flames, indicate that soot first forms by the walls at the end of combustion or slightly after during the expansion stroke. The results give for the first time an indication of the level of local-enrichment that would be expected to cause a significant increase in soot production in spark-ignition direct-injection engines operating on gasoline at moderate engine load and speed conditions.",

Further, quantum chemistry calculations at CBS-QB3 level of theory are applied to determine bond dissociation energies (BDEs) and thereby suggest the initial reactions of the ignition process for all of these fuels. Using the calculated BDEs, it is found that the ignition characteristics are similar among furans and among tetrahydrofurans, but strongly differ between these molecular classes. It is shown that the ignition behavior of aromatic furans is determined by the ring structure, which correlates with a negligible side chain influence. Hence, furan fuel structures can be chosen with respect to feasibility of the production pathways and engine compatibility. On the contrary, the side chain length for tetrahydrofurans defines the potential application paradigm. Tetrahydrofurans with short side chains are candidates for SI application, whereas 2-butyltetrahydrofuran may be a candidate for diesel application. The influence of the number and location of double bonds in the ring is illustrated with the additional study of dihydrofurans, and the influence of other functional groups is evaluated for (tetrahydro) furfuryl alcohols.To investigate possible fuel application scenarios, a second part of this study investigates DCNs of furanic fuel blends in n-heptane and diesel fuel. A DCN mixing rule is found to be approximately linear and for blends with up to 20\u00a0mol% furans, the side chain structure (alkyl, alcohol) has no distinct influence on the blend DCN.",

Detailed transport properties together with a skeletal PRF chemical kinetic mechanism are employed in the simulations. The initial partially premixed charge is prescribed according to a two-injection of fuel strategy with a 50% exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The motion of the piston, hence, the effect of compression of the charge due to the piston motion is considered. The simulations are performed with a fine mesh with a spatial resolution of 1.2 micrometers in a cubic domain of 614 micrometers on each side. The results show that there are three distinctive combustion regions in a domain under PPC conditions, a lean homogeneous mixture region, a fuel-rich region, and in between a region with stoichiometric mixture. Auto-ignition occurs first in the lean and stoichiometric mixture regions, followed by a partially premixed flame in the fuel-rich region and at last a CO oxidation phase in the fuel-rich region. In the lean mixture region, the fuel and the combustion intermediates such as CO are consumed almost completely due to the relatively fast combustion and the abundant oxygen. The CO formed in the regions with the stoichiometric and the fuel-rich mixture is consumed in a mixing controlled mode, which requires a high-level turbulence mixing or a sufficiently long residence time. NO is formed mainly due to the premixed combustion in the region with the stoichiometric mixture.",

Simulations of Partial Fuel Stratification (PFS) have been performed using CONVERGE with a 96-species reduced mechanism for a 4-component gasoline surrogate. Comparison is made to experimental data from the Sandia HCCI engine at a compression ratio 14:1 at intake pressures of 1\u00a0bar and 2\u00a0bar. Analysis of the heat release and temperature in the different equivalence ratio (\u03c6) regions reveals that sequential auto-ignition of the stratified charge occurs in order of increasing \u03c6 for 1\u00a0bar intake pressure but in order of decreasing \u03c6 for 2\u00a0bar intake pressure. Increased low- and intermediate-temperature heat release at 2\u00a0bar intake pressure compensates for decreased temperatures in higher-\u03c6 regions due to evaporative cooling from the liquid fuel spray and decreased compression heating from lower values of the ratio of specific heats. At 1\u00a0bar intake pressure, the premixed portion of the charge auto-ignites before the highest-\u03c6 regions and the sequential auto-ignition occurs too fast for useful reduction of the maximum pressure rise rate compared to HCCI. Conversely, at 2\u00a0bar intake pressure, the premixed portion of the charge auto-ignites last, after the higher-\u03c6 regions. More importantly, the sequential auto-ignition occurs over a longer time period than at 1\u00a0bar intake pressure such that a sizable reduction in the maximum pressure rise rate compared to HCCI can be achieved.",

     "abstract": "The prediction of autoignition (AI) delay is an essential prerequisite to account for abnormal combustions (e.g. knock or super knock) that can appear in Internal Combustion (IC) engines. In this paper, a simple model called Ignition to Propagation Reduced Scheme (IPRS) is proposed to add AI predictions in reduced chemical schemes, which are classically used to compute in-cylinder combustion in the context of Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The IPRS principle is to use a single two-reaction reduced scheme and adapt the pre-exponential factor of the fuel oxidation reaction as a function of the temperature: one value is used at low temperatures to correctly predict AI delays and an other one can be used at higher temperatures, where heat release occurs, to keep the flame propagation properties of the chemical scheme. After a first section that introduces the model, Perfectly Stirred Reactors and 1D flames simulations are used to verify that: (1) the modification of the pre-exponential constant of the Arrhenius law at low temperature does not alter the propagation properties of the reduced scheme and (2) this modification is sufficient to accurately predict AI delays. The IPRS model captures autoignition times exactly like a full chemical scheme in a compressed zero dimensional test case representative of engine compression. In the last section this model is applied to 1D single hot spot simulations to investigate the modes of reaction after autoignition.",

     "abstract": "A new combustion regime classification method is proposed for HCCI/PCCI combustion based on Lagrangian fluid particle tracking. The performance of the present method is demonstrated with the time trace of net heat conduction to local mixture which is one of the quantities best representing the phenomena. Local combustion regimes are classified based on magnitudes of the maximum and minimum heat conduction on each fluid particle throughout the combustion process into autoignition, flame propagation and flame enclosing. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent HCCI/PCCI combustion are conducted with different initial temperature fluctuations. A detailed kinetic mechanism including 53\u00a0species and 325\u00a0elementary reactions is used for methane\u2013air reaction and a reduced kinetic mechanism including 37\u00a0species and 61\u00a0reactions is adopted for n-heptane\u2013air reaction. The present DNS results show that the combustion process is highly sensitive to initial temperature fluctuations. The proposed method is applied to DNS results and the characteristics of fluid element classified into each combustion regime are investigated. By adopting appropriate threshold for the maximum and minimum heat conduction to local mixture, the contributions of three combustion regimes to whole fuel consumption can be discussed. The autoignition regime is dominant for lower temperature fluctuation case. However, the flame propagation and flame enclosing regimes turn to be significant for higher temperature fluctuation case where the autoignition regime is less than 20% and only triggers combustion start. Such qualitative tendency is confirmed in two fuel species. However, quantitatively, the transition of dominant combustion regime from autoignition to flame propagation/flame enclosing takes place at lower temperature fluctuation for the n-heptane\u2013air mixture case. The proposed classification method effectively characterizes the turbulent combustion process in HCCI/PCCI engines. This classification method can be extended to quantify reaction mechanisms by tracking representative quantities such as the mole fraction of key intermediates.",

     "abstract": "In this work, the effect of diluent composition is studied on the ignition timing and combustion duration of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion. Full-cycle 3-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed using two different dilution schemes, one which employs air dilution and the other which employs external exhaust gas recirculation (eEGR) dilution. Both cases used a fixed breathing strategy, and had the same fueling rate and engine speed typical of automotive applications. A premixed fuel\u2013air mixture was used in the intake charge to avoid the fuel stratification effects associated with direct injection, while the valve events were selected to minimize the internal residual and its associated thermal and compositional stratification. With ignition timing held constant near top dead center (TDC) for both methods, there is a 10% increase in the combustion duration going from air to eEGR dilution. While the thermal stratification prior to ignition is similar for both methods, the eEGR-dilute case has an overall higher temperature throughout the charge. A reactivity stratification analysis, based on the distribution of ignition delays within the charge prior to ignition, showed nearly identical initial reactivity for the two methods, with the higher temperatures of the eEGR case compensating for this method\u2019s lower oxygen content. A quasi-dimensional multi-zone model was subsequently used to decouple the chemical kinetic and thermodynamic effects of eEGR on the combustion process. This analysis showed that the primary factor contributing to the longer combustion duration for the eEGR-dilute case is the lower ratio of specific heats (\u03b3) in the unburned charge post-ignition which is thought to lower the rate of compression-induced heating of the unburned charge by the ignited and burning regions, leading to slower sequential auto-ignition.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents a direct numerical simulation (DNS) study of ignition characteristics in compositionally and thermally stratified n-heptane/air mixtures, relevant to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines. Nine two-dimensional constant volume cases are simulated. For each of three different mean temperatures, all within the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region, three cases having different levels of mixture stratification are considered. Local temperature fluctuations, negatively correlated with mixture fraction fluctuations are also considered. It is shown that as the level of stratification increases, the heat release rate has a lower peak in the first stage for the mean temperature of 850\u00a0K. An opposite behaviour is observed for the mean temperature of 950\u00a0K. Inspection of the homogeneous ignition delay suggests that the distribution of ignition delay time at the initial conditions leads to the observed behaviour.In the second stage of ignition, stratification reduces the ignition delay time and the peak heat release rate relative to a homogeneous case for all three mean temperatures. However, a non-monotonic behaviour for the peak heat release rate in the second stage is observed for the mean temperatures of 850 and 950 K. This behaviour for cases with the mean temperature of 950\u00a0K can be attributed to the mixture-fraction dependence of ignition delay times, which shows a local minimum at mixtures which are richer than the mean mixture fraction. Due to this effect, increased levels of stratification results in the introduction of a larger range of mixture fractions having similar ignition delay times. However, for cases with the mean temperature of 850\u00a0K, the distribution of homogeneous ignition delay time does not explain the non-monotonic behaviour. For these cases, the analysis suggests that molecular mixing plays an important role in the steepening of the heat release rate at higher stratification levels.",

     "abstract": "Usually different autoignition modes can be generated by a hot spot in which ignition occurs earlier than that in the surrounding mixture. However, for large hydrocarbon fuels with negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior, ignition happens earlier at lower temperature than that at higher temperature when the temperature is within the NTC regime. Consequently, a cool spot may also result in different autoignition modes. In this study, the modes of reaction front propagation caused by temperature gradient in a one dimensional planar configuration are investigated numerically for n-heptane/air mixture at initial temperature within and below the NTC regime. For the first time, different supersonic autoignition modes caused by a cool spot with positive temperature gradient are identified. It is found that the initial temperature gradient has strong impact on autoignition modes. With the increase of the positive temperature gradient of the cool spot, supersonic autoignitive deflagration, detonation, shock-detonation, and shock-deflagration are sequentially observed. It is found that shock compression of the mixture between the deflagration wave and leading shock wave produces an additional ignition kernel, which determines the autoignition modes. Furthermore, the cool spot is compared with the hot spot with temperature below the NTC regime. Similar autoignition modes are observed for the hot and cool spots. Different autoignition modes in the considered simplified configuration are summarized in terms of the normalized temperature gradient and acoustic-to-excitation time scale ratio. It is shown that the transition between different autoignition modes is not greatly affected by the NTC behavior. Therefore, our 1-D simulation indicates that like hot spot, the cool spot may also generate knock in engines when fuels with NTC behavior is used and the temperature is within the NTC regime.",

Imaging PAH\u2013LIF from pulsed-laser excitation at three discrete wavelengths (266, 532, and 633\u00a0nm) reveals the temporal growth of PAH molecules, while soot-LII from a 1064-nm pulsed laser indicates inception to soot. The distribution of PAH\u2013LIF also grows spatially within the combustion chamber before soot-LII is first detected. The PAH\u2013LIF signals have broad spectra, much like LII, but typically with spectral profile that is inconsistent with laser-heated soot. Quantitative natural-emission spectroscopy also shows a broad emission spectrum, presumably from PAH chemiluminescence, temporally coinciding with of the PAH\u2013LIF.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for modelling combustion in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) conditions based on the first order conditional moment closure (CMC) method. The model is implemented into the open source C++ computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code known as OpenFOAM. Direct numerical simulations (DNSs) are used to evaluate the performance of the CFD-CMC solver. In the two-dimensional (2D) DNS cases, ignition of a lean n-heptane/air mixture with thermal inhomogeneities is simulated for nine cases, with two different mean temperatures and several different levels of thermal stratification. Results from the CFD-CMC solver are in excellent agreement with the DNS for cases which exhibit a spontaneous sequential ignition mode of combustion whereas for the cases in which a mixed mode of deflagration and spontaneous ignition exists, the CMC underpredicts the ignition delay. Further investigation using the DNS data demonstrates that this discrepancy is primarily attributed to the first order closure assumption. Conditional fluctuations are found to be more significant in the case with deflagrations. Further analysis of the DNS shows that scalar dissipation fluctuations are the cause of conditional fluctuations.",

     "abstract": "Ion sensing is a promising approach for cycle resolved combustion phasing in HCCI engines. This paper investigates the fundamental processes affecting the phase difference (Pdelta) between ion current signal phase Ion50 and combustion phase CA50 based on 2 numerical models. One model is used to explore fluid dynamic effects on an HCCI engine. The other model, a 10-zone model, is used to primarily explore the affecting mechanism on Pdelta. Both numerical analysis and experimental results of the ionization process indicate that Pdelta is affected by both flame ionization and fuel heat release process. For fuels with similar octane number (ON), such as gasoline (ON\u00a0=\u00a097) and ethanol (ON\u00a0=\u00a0107), both the combustion phase CA50 and the ion current signal phase Ion50 retard when the equivalence ratio \u03a6 decreases. However, the CA50 for ethanol fuel retards moderately compared with the gasoline case since the CA50 for ethanol fuel is more sensitive to intake temperature Tin rather than \u03a6. Then larger Pdelta values can be seen in ethanol fueled HCCI engine under lower \u03a6 conditions. For the fuels with different widely octane number, such as gasoline and diesel (ON\u00a0=\u00a00), their combustion boundary conditions are different in HCCI engines, they produce ions at a different ratio. For diesel fuel, the ion production rate is much lower due to the lower intake temperature and higher compression ratio. Under low \u03a6 conditions, the ion current signal cannot be observed at the beginning of ion concentration increase in diesel fueled HCCI engines, and the Ion50 appears much later compared with the gasoline fueled HCCI engine. As a result, the values of Pdelta increase significantly in the diesel fueled HCCI engine.",

HCCI engines are similar to a well-stirred reactor and operate at lean equivalence ratios (\u03d5). Under these conditions, the ion current becomes increasingly indistinguishable from background noise. This paper investigates various fuel additive effects on ion signal at low \u03d5\u2019s, determines side effects of metal acetate addition, and validates a numerical model. The fuel additives added to ethanol were sodium acetate (NaOAc), potassium acetate (KOAc), and cesium acetate (CsOAc). Concentration levels ranging from 0.5 to 4.9\u00a0mmol/L of metal acetate-in-ethanol are investigated over \u03d5\u2019s 0.11, 0.22, 0.28, and 0.32. The engine operated under naturally aspirated conditions and maintained a constant timing of 2.5\u00b0 after top-dead-center (ATDC) at the crank angle degree (CAD) where 50% of the heat release occurs (CA50). CsOAc consistently produced the strongest ion signals, followed by KOAc and NaOAc, which NaOAc had the weakest effect on ion signal. No distinguishable ion signals were measured at \u03d5\u00a0=\u00a00.11, but significant ion signal improvements occurred at \u03d5\u00a0=\u00a00.22 using the fuel additives. However, the addition of the metal acetates decreased heat release rates (HRR) and peak cylinder pressures. Although CsOAc produced the largest signal improvements, it also had the largest decrease in HRR and peak cylinder pressure. Additionally, a single-zone engine model that simulates the chemical kinetics and ion chemistry of KOAc addition is presented and validated with the experimental results.",

     "abstract": "Spark Assisted Compression Ignition (SACI) combustion is capable of partially decoupling combustion phasing from peak heat release rate, overcoming one of the major challenges associated with low temperature combustion. Experimental SACI studies have shown that for a given combustion phasing, peak heat release rate can be modulated by trading the fraction of the fresh charge consumed by flame propagation with the fraction consumed by auto-ignition. The chemical and physical mechanisms controlling the changes in heat release rate are not well known. The current work uses computational simulation to explore these modes through the combined control of spark timing and charge temperature via changes in negative valve overlap. Open cycle CFD simulation results are compared with experimental data to validate a newly developed SACI model, and used to gain insight into the processes governing combustion behavior. The simulations predict a 43% reduction in the peak rate of heat release with increasing spark advance, while the unburned charge mass at the time of auto-ignition decreases by only 23%. Detailed analysis of the end-gas thermodynamic state prior to auto-ignition shows as spark is advanced, the end-gas thermal and compositional distributions vary with the fraction of the charge consumed by the flame. The reduction in the rate of peak rate of heat release during the auto-ignition process is therefore a function of both the mass of the end-gas and the end-gas reactivity.",

However, controlling this kind of combustion remains difficult and represents a real challenge. The present investigation focussed on the use of different oxidizing chemical species (ozone, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) which can modify the chemical kinetic governing HCCI combustion. Experiments were conducted on a single cylinder HCCI engine fuelled with iso-octane, for constant engine parameters and for oxidizing species concentrations varying from 0 up to 100\u00a0ppm. These experimental results are coupled with kinetic analyses in a homogeneous constant volume reactor performed with a detailed kinetic mechanism. The effects of ozone, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide were initially studied and compared when they separately seed the intake of the engine. Results showed that all the molecules improve HCCI iso-octane combustion. The highest effect on CA50 phasing was observed for ozone while the lowest was for nitrogen dioxide. These results were confirmed and explained by a kinetic interpretation. HCCI experiments were then carried out with ozone and nitric oxide injected together in the intake of the engine. Experimental results show a combustion enhancement when these two molecules are present but a delay in CA50 phasing was observed for low ozone concentrations and a constant nitric oxide concentration until the ozone concentration becomes higher. A kinetic interpretation, through two-step computations, showed that there is a strong oxidizing reaction between nitric oxide and ozone, yielding nitrogen dioxide. Therefore, the presence of nitrogen dioxide can explain the CA50 delay observed due to its low effect among all the oxidizing chemical species studied.",

These variabilities and their impact on the success or failure of ignition are still not fully understood. In this paper, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of laser ignition sequences in an academic swirled turbulent partially premixed burner are performed to obtain statistical information at three selected ignition locations representative of the various ignition scenarios observed. The velocity and mixing fields are first validated against measurements to eliminate uncertainty associated with the non-reacting flow. LES is then shown to recover the ignition statistical behavior and probability for the selected ignition locations. Moreover, LES analysis allows to identify the various mechanisms that drive ignition failure or success. Statistics of flame displacement speed are used to demonstrate the effect of curvature and stretch in regions of intense turbulence and the impact of partial premixing on the ignition process.",

Ignition delay times have been measured behind reflected shock waves for this averaged mixture with an equivalence ratio of 0.5 (0.4554% CO/0.3297% H2/0.1032% CO2/0.0172% CH4/0.2407% H2O/0.8538% O2 in 98% Ar (mol.%)) at around 1.7, 13, and 32\u00a0atm. The same mixture was also investigated with impurities (200\u00a0ppm of NH3 and 50\u00a0ppm of H2S). Care was taken when working with the blends containing H2O and NH3 to avoid errors in the shock-tube composition; direct measurement of the water vapor mole fractions were performed using a tunable diode laser absorption diagnostic near 1.38\u00a0\u03bcm. The effect of the various constituents on the ignition delay time was also investigated by comparing to results from a baseline mixture (H2/CO/O2/Ar) and results with this baseline mixture with only one of the other constituents of the syngas (i.e., CO2, CH4, H2S). Experimental data were compared with recent detailed kinetics mechanisms from the literature. Results showed that, under the conditions of this study, extending the mixture composition to include realistic concentrations of species beyond just the CO and H2 does not have a very large effect on the ignition delay time for a coal-derived syngas. However, a comparison of this coal-derived syngas with a syngas derived from biomass, tested in an earlier study by the authors, exhibited large differences due to the larger CH4 concentration in the bio-derived syngas. Two chemical kinetic models from the literature were found suitable to reproduce these data over most of the range of mixtures, temperatures, and pressures investigated, namely the mechanisms associated with Galway and with Princeton.",

The dependence of the ignition delay times upon temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio has been investigated at high temperatures. Correlation expressions for the ignition delay under different equivalence ratios and pressures have been deduced separately.

High-speed (150\u00a0kHz) schlieren imaging allowed visualization of the temporal progression of the fuel vapor penetration as well as the low- and high-temperature ignition events, while formaldehyde fluorescence was induced by a pulsed (7-ns), 355-nm planar laser sheet at a select time during the same injection. Fluorescence from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was also observed and was distinguished from formaldehyde PLIF both temporally and spatially. A characteristic feature previously recorded in schlieren images of similar flames, in which refractive index gradients significantly diminish, has been confirmed to be coincident with large formaldehyde fluorescence signal during low-temperature ignition. Low-temperature reactions initiate near the radial periphery of the spray on the injector side of the spray head. Formaldehyde persists on the injector side of the lift-off length and forms rapidly near the injector following the end of injection. The consumption of formaldehyde coincides with the position and timing of high-temperature ignition and low-density zones that are clearly evident in the schlieren imaging. After the end of injection, the formaldehyde that formed on the injector side of the lift-off length is consumed as a high-temperature ignition front propagates back toward the injector tip.",

For the finite-rate chemistry LES, two global and two skeletal reaction mechanisms were utilized to evaluate the accuracy and tradeoffs of global and skeletal reaction mechanisms. This type of assessments has previously been carried out for simple flames but not for industrial flames at laboratory conditions with detailed measurement data. The LES predictions generally show very good agreement with the experimental data for the flow field, temperature and major species. Different reaction mechanisms do not affect the flow field as much as the temperature and species profiles, which show clear imprints of the selected reaction mechanism. The results further indicate that the industrial flame is best captured with the skeletal reaction mechanisms, whilst the global mechanisms predict too compact flames. The results from the skeletal reaction mechanisms are then used in conjunction with the experimental data to assess the flame characteristics which best can be described as interacting flamelets embedded in an environment of distributed reaction zones.",

The latter may subsequently influence the velocity field in such a manner that feedback leads to self-excited thermoacoustic instability. The present paper investigates interrelations between the thermal and the acoustic responses of premix flames. The analysis is formulated such that it properly represents the underlying causality of acoustics\u2013flow\u2013flame\u2013acoustics interactions. A flame-intrinsic feedback loop is revealed, which is quite independent of the acoustic environment of the flame, i.e. the acoustic impedances of plenum and combustor. The eigenmodes of this flame-intrinsic feedback loop coincide with poles of the acoustic scattering matrix of the flame. The corresponding frequencies, where the acoustic response is maximum, are in general quite different from frequencies where the thermal response is strong, i.e. where the flame transfer function exhibits \u201cexcess gain\u201d. Even more remarkable, the intrinsic flame modes may result in thermoacoustic instabilities without lock-on to one of the acoustic eigenmodes of the combustor.

Large-scale helical vortical structures are generated near the inlet of combustion chamber, and a lot of fine-scale vortices emerge downstream. Flame structure is engulfed by the vortical structures and depends largely on the swirl number. Spectral analysis of pressure oscillation on walls shows that quarter-wave mode of longitudinal acoustics has the largest energy, and that characteristic oscillations are found at higher frequencies. To investigate oscillation modes of pressure and heat release rate fields, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is applied to DNS results. It is shown that there are differences between dominant frequencies in spectral analysis of time-series pressure data at one point of walls and DMD of time-series pressure field data. DMD of pressure field reveals that the quarter-wave mode in longitudinal acoustics has the largest energy for the case of S = 0.6 . Furthermore, it is clarified that the transverse acoustic plane waves and pressure oscillations induced by large-scale vortical motions play important roles for the pressure oscillations in combustors.

We acoustically force this system at different amplitudes and frequencies, and measure its response with pressure transducers and OH\u2217 chemiluminescence from the flame. By analyzing the data with the power spectral density and the Poincar\u00e9 map, we find a range of nonlinear dynamics, including (i) a shifting of the self-excited frequency towards or away from the forcing frequency as the forcing amplitude increases; (ii) an accompanying transition from periodicity to two-frequency quasiperiodicity; and (iii) an eventual suppression of the self-excited amplitude, indicating synchronization of the self-excited mode with the forced mode. By further analyzing the data with the Hilbert transform, we find evidence of phase trapping, a partially synchronous state characterized by frequency locking without phase locking.All of these dynamics can be found in universal model oscillators subjected to external forcing. This suggests that such oscillators can be used to accurately represent thermoacoustically self-excited combusting systems subjected to similar forcing.

     "abstract": "In annular combustion chambers of aero-engines and gas turbines, acoustic coupling may arise from azimuthal modes which are less well damped than axial modes. Also, since the circumference is the largest length in the combustor, the azimuthal modes have the lowest resonance frequencies and are most prone to instability. Such a coupling raises many scientific issues which are considered in a small number of fundamental experiments. The present investigation focuses on this problem and provides experimental data on a special type of combustion instability in which the thermo-acoustic resonant coupling involves a combination of modes. This produces an unusual pattern of flame responses in which the distribution of heat release rate is slanted. Data are provided in the form of free radical light intensity patterns (interpreted as heat release rate distributions) and microphone signals detected in the plenum and chamber. It is shown that the slanted pattern is the signature of a combination of two modes with coinciding frequencies, the first being a standing azimuthal mode while the second is an axial mode. Measurements of the flame describing function on a single matrix burner at the fundamental frequency are used to explain the observed phase shift and amplitude in the flame responses of the different injectors in the annular combustor.",

The multiscale entropy method and nonlinear forecasting method, which have not been previously adopted for the analysis of combustion instability, demonstrate that combustion instability close to LBO exhibits much more complicated stochastic dynamics than fractional Brownian motion. The permutation entropy, which can be estimated by quantifying the rank order pattern of components in phase space vectors constructed from the short time-series data of pressure fluctuations, is used as a control variable to prevent LBO. The online method proposed in this work has the potential to control the complex combustion state close to LBO.",

     "abstract": "In the past, flame geometry was found to play an important role in determining when strong pressure fluctuations associated with a combustion instability occur in a gas turbine model combustor. The goals of this study were to use flame surface area as a more accurate way to quantify the flame shape and the heat release rate, in lieu of chemiluminescence; to accurately resolve both the spatial structure and the time history of the heat release fluctuations, and to show that kilohertz formaldehyde planar laser-induced fluorescence provides a new way to achieve these goals. The dual-swirl burner, developed at DLR Stuttgart by Meier et al. was operated using dimethyl ether (DME) to study fluctuations in the flame surface area, flame brush, flame length, and heat release rate. To understand the instability, accurate measurements are needed of the correlation between heat release rate fluctuations and pressure fluctuations. Thus heat release rate must be recorded as a function of time and space. However conventional chemiluminescence offers only a line-of-sight measurement. High-speed CH2O PLIF was applied to study the motion of flame surfaces in response to the pressure oscillations. Results show that the flame surface density fluctuated at the acoustic frequency (typically 320\u00a0Hz). The frequency of the combustion instability was found to increase as either the gas velocity or the flame speed was increased. These trends are consistent with previous n-\u03c4 theories that model the convective time delay. Strong pressure oscillations occur for conditions when the flame is nearly flat; the instability disappears when the flame becomes V-shaped. The explanation is that all points on a flatter flame have the same convective time delay but this is not true for the V-flame geometry.",

Phase-synchronized OH-PLIF images suggested critical clues of CI driving mechanisms, including the periodic alternation of flame attachment/detachment and vortex coupling with everlasting flames at the outer recirculation zone due to high hydrogen fuels\u2019 high reactivity. These PLIF results also demonstrated that the relatively short mixing length and highly fuel-dependent flame length are the root causes of a high instability-mode and sensible mode-shift. Thus, PLIF images were used to calculate the flame length by obtaining the intensity-weighted centroid for the more precise time-lag analysis. The spatio-temporal RI results indicated that the fuel composition affects the location and intensity of CI driving/damping, RI frequency, and instability mode and frequency. POD analysis from high-speed OH\u2217 images showed that the distinct coherent structures and large roll-up of flames are responsible for generating flame oscillations for each mode. High cross-correlation between the POD modes showed the convection of these coherent structures and axially-alternative swirl-like flame motions. At some particular compositions of H2/CH4/CO, high multi-mode CI was observed (e.g., the 3rd, 4th, and 6th modes appear simultaneously) and the original time-lag model could not be applicable, since the acoustic pressure wave is not simply sinusoidal but largely distorted. Thus, a new time-lag model using skewness time (\u03c4skew) was proposed to reflect the distortion from multi-mode CI and the accuracy of this model was verified using the experimental data.",

Methane\u2013hydrogen mixtures are used to explore the role of the fuel in changing the flame macrostructure, as determined by chemiluminescence, as the equivalence ratio ( \u03d5 ) varies. We observe four different configurations: a columnar flame (I); a bubble-columnar flame (II); a single conical flame (III); and a double conical flame (IV). We also observe different thermo-acoustic modes in the lean regime investigated, \u03d5 \u2208 [ 0.5 - 0.75 ] , that correspond to different flame configurations. By changing the combustor length without affecting the underlying flow, the resonant modes of the combustor are shifted to higher frequencies allowing for the decoupling of heat release fluctuations and the acoustic field over a range of equivalence ratio. We find that the same flame macrostructures observed in the long, acoustically coupled combustor arise in the short, acoustically decoupled combustor and transition at similar equivalence ratios in both combustors. The onset of the first fully unstable mode in the long combustor occurs at similar equivalence ratio as the flame transition from configuration III to IV. In the acoustically decoupled case, this transition occurs gradually starting with the intermittent appearance of a flame in the outer recirculation zone (ORZ). Spectral analysis of this phenomenon, referred to as\u00a0\u201cORZ flame flickering\u201d shows the existence of an unsteady event occurring over a narrow frequency band centered around 28\u00a0Hz along with a weaker broadband region at lower frequency in the range [1\u201310]\u00a0Hz. The tone at 28\u00a0Hz is shown to be associated with the azimuthal advection of the flame by the outer recirculation zone flow. Changes in the fuel composition, by adding hydrogen (up to 20%), do not affect the correspondence between the thermo-acoustic modes and the flame macrostructures, but shift the transition points to lower equivalence ratio.",

Particular attention is given to their effect on the time-varying behaviour of azimuthal modes observed in recent experiments and Large Eddy Simulations (LES) in azimuthally symmetric annular chambers. This time-varying behaviour causes the azimuthal modes to switch back and forth between spinning and standing wave modes. With the addition of a single baffle, the azimuthal symmetry of the chamber was broken leading to a coupling between the clockwise (CW) and anticlockwise (ACW) azimuthal acoustic waves. This eliminated the time-varying behaviour and promoted standing wave modes. It was found that three or more baffles were required to achieve significant damping of the modes. Since almost perfect standing wave modes occurred with the addition of a single baffle, high-speed chemiluminescence measurements were obtained to characterise the unsteady heat release rate at the pressure node and anti-node. Previous studies have shown that maximum and minimum heat release rate is produced at the anti-nodes and nodes respectively. As found previously, peak fluctuations at the anti-nodes result from axisymmetric fluctuations in heat release rate caused by pressure fluctuations driving axial mass flow fluctuations at the burner inlet. However, at the pressure nodes, an anti-symmetric structure was observed producing negligible heat release rate via the mechanism of cancellation. This latter result suggests that transverse velocity fluctuations play an important mechanistic role in ensuring that negligible heat release rate is produced at the node.",

It is first shown that for globally fuel lean injection conditions, the spray flames investigated burn in a non-premixed mode. A non-sooty and a sooty regime are explored. Their frequency response to acoustic forcing is characterized by exploiting the OH\u2217 chemiluminescence signal and a velocity signal measured by Laser Doppler velocimetry at the air injection unit outlet. It is found that the FDF of these non-premixed swirl spray flames features a distinct response compared to the FDF of lean premixed swirl flames. The gain and phase lag of these FDF are both a strong function of the perturbation amplitude. At a fixed forcing frequency, the FDF phase lag increases with the perturbation level for the non-sooty flame investigated and it decreases for the sooty flame case. The sooty flame has also a much lower cut-off frequency for the FDF gain than the non-sooty flame. It is then shown that these features are essential to reproduce the correct instability bands and oscillation frequencies observed at limit cycles in the experiments. For the sooty flame, combustion is always found stable in agreement with the low cut-off frequency found for the FDF. A linear analysis for the non-sooty flame fails to capture the low frequency instabilities observed in the experiments that have the largest oscillation levels. Only the use of the FDF yields the correct dynamical states observed in the combustor. It is further concluded that the OH\u2217 chemiluminescence signal may safely be used to infer the frequency response of these non-premixed swirl spray flames at globally fuel lean injection conditions.",

Detailed measurements were performed in 4 fuel split (to upstream/downstream injections) conditions while keeping the total equivalence ratio constant. The combustion stability was found to be very sensitive to the fuel split parameter which determined the local equivalence ratio distribution. The majority of the heat-release oscillations was generated in the flame-to-wall impingement region in a manner that satisfied the Rayleigh criterion. The driving force of the instability was considered the periodic interaction between the traveling vortex filled with fresh mixtures and the flame in the near-wall region as reported in the previous study on homogeneous mixture flame. However, the strength of the instability was sensitively modified by the change in the local equivalence ratio distribution. In the strongest oscillation case with inhomogeneous mixture, temporal variations of equivalence ratio exhibited a positive contribution to the thermoacoustic coupling. This suggested that temporal variations in equivalence ratio were enhancing the driving factor of the thermoacoustic instability in addition to the vortex-flame interaction mechanism.",

A linearized version of the G-equation model is employed to describe the flame dynamics, combined with effects of axial and azimuthal velocity perturbations downstream of the swirlers. The model accounts for the phase shift between the main acoustic and swirler vortical perturbations, which propagate at different speeds. The very different flame structures generated by different fuel splits lead to different flame responses.

The flame is operated with methane and air in a gas turbine model combustor at ambient temperature and pressure. Transport and mixing of fuel is visualized by fluorescence of acetone, which is added with 9% by volume to the methane. The dominant unsteady flow structures are a precessing vortex core (PVC) in the shear layer of the inner recirculation zone and the lower stagnation point (LSP) at the flame root. The measurements show that fuel and air are largely separated at the inlet of the combustion chamber, but are then strongly mixed by the PVC. A well-mixed zone of unburned fuel and air is formed around the vortex, and then ignited by recirculating burned gas. At the flame root, the PVC induces periodic changes in the composition of the unburned gas, which varies between pure air and well-mixed fuel and air. Reaction is locally quenched at the LSP when fresh air without fuel is present, and re-ignition takes place when mixed fuel and air arrive at the boundary of recirculating burned gas. Generally, the results show that the enhancement of fuel\u2013air mixing induced by the PVC contributes significantly to the stabilization of the flame, and that the flame dynamics can only be properly understood when an analysis of transient mixing mechanisms is included.",

It is shown that the appearance of a helical flow instability, featuring a precessing vortex core, is strongly dependent on the flame shape. Flames attached to the burner exit may suppress the precessing vortex core if the flame features a sufficient length, while suppression is not observed for very short attached and all detached flames.

A double-sector LES is also computed to investigate flame/flame interactions. These LES-based HFRMs are then used as inputs for a Helmholtz solver and results show that (1) subgrid-scale LES models lead to marginal effects on the harmonic flame response while (2) azimuthal confinement, thermal conditions and fuel type strongly affect the flame response to acoustics and therefore control the stability of the azimuthal mode.

     "abstract": "This paper reviews recent advances in understanding the structure of turbulent partially premixed and stratified flames. The term \u201cpartially premixed\u201d refers here to compositionally inhomogeneous mixtures that include flammable and non-flammable fluid while \u201cstratified\u201d combustion refers to a reacting front propagating through a range of compositions within the flammable limits. An overview of relevant laminar flame concepts is first introduced. In laminar partially premixed flames, the interaction between rich and lean mixtures is significant leading to improvement in the flame\u2019s resistance to extinction by straining. In lean back-supported laminar stratified flames, the flux of excess heat and radicals into the lean fluid results in higher flame speeds, broader reaction zones, and extended flammability limits compared to homogeneous counterparts. Rich stratified flames are more complex due to the combined fluxes of heat as well as reactive species such as H2 and CO.Recent research in turbulent partially premixed as well as stratified flames is reviewed. Detailed measurements in burners representative of those found in gas turbine combustors show that partial premixing at the lifted flame base increases with instability. Well-characterised laboratory burners where different fuel concentration gradients may be imposed at the jet exit plane show improved flame stability due to mixed-mode combustion. Maximum stability is reached at some optimum level of compositional inhomogeneity. Highly resolved measurements in turbulent stratified flames show that the mass fractions of CO and H2 increase with stratification; a result that is consistent with laminar flame studies. Such experiments are, however, very difficult and require multi-level conditioning of the data. The paper concludes with a brief review of potential numerical approaches employed in the calculations of turbulent flames with inhomogeneous inlet conditions. A key challenge here is to reproduce the effects of increasing levels of stratification and/or inhomogeneity on the compositional structure of turbulent flames.",

Extensive testing is done to assess the effect of molecular transport on the performance of the different mixing models and on the prediction of the flame extinction limit. It is found that the molecular transport has a significant effect on the prediction of the upstream mixing layer between the pilot stream and the coflow, where the turbulence level is weak or it is laminar and hence the molecular transport dominates the turbulent transport. Accounting for the molecular transport increases the models\u2019 resistance (for the IEM model and the modified Curl model) to flame extinction and yields a burning flame with a lower mixing rate that can cause global extinction without molecular transport. A modification to the mixing frequency is introduced to account for the effect of the molecular diffusion on mixing. With such a modification, the modeled flame sustainability is further enhanced and a lower mixing rate can be used, which enhances the ability of the IEM model and the modified Curl model which were previously found to yield a burning flame solution only at a highly increased rate of mixing.",

The Damk\u00f6hler number, stoichiometric mixture fraction and fuel and oxidizer compositions also are matched between simulation and experiment. Simultaneous OH / CH 2 O PLIF imaging is performed experimentally to characterize the spatial structure of the turbulent DME flames. The simulation shows a fully burning flame initially, which undergoes partial extinction and subsequently, reignition. The scalar dissipation rate ( \u03c7 ) increases to a value much greater than that calculated from near-extinction strained laminar flames, leading to the observed local extinction. As the turbulence decays, the local values of \u03c7 decrease and the flame reignites. The reignition process appears to be strongly dependent on the local \u03c7 value, which is consistent with previous results for simpler fuels. Statistics of OH and CH 2 O are compared between simulation and experiment and found to agree. The applicability of OH / CH 2 O (formaldehyde) product imaging as a surrogate for peak heat release rate is investigated. The concentration product is found to predict peak heat release rate extremely well in the simulation data. When this product imaging is applied to the experimental data, a similar extinction/reignition pattern also is observed in the experiments as a function of axial position.

     "abstract": "The Lagrangian CMC method is developed by conditionally averaging the quantities associated with Lagrangian particles originating from the nozzle exit. It involves multiple flame groups of sequentially injected fuel, each of which shares the same conditional flame structure under the same residence time. The probability, pk, to find the kth group is assumed proportional to the partial mean mixture fraction, \u03be k \u223c , to obtain the local conditional flame structure as a weighted average by pk. The Lagrangian CMC method allows flexibility of flamelet based methods and requires less computational load than Eulerian CMC. It is implemented in OpenFOAM and applied with first and second order closure to the piloted jet diffusion flames near extinction, Sandia Flame D and E. Results show good agreement for all conditional profiles and noticeable improvement by second order correction of four rate limiting steps in the GRI 3.0 mechanism. Good agreement is achieved for conditional variances and covariances among temperature and species involved in the rate limiting reaction steps.",

The filtered flame structure and thickness is captured with three controlling variables which are the filtered mixture fraction, the filtered progress variable and the filter size.

Specifically, we present temporally-based statistics of temperature fluctuations at multiple simultaneous spatial positions with a specific focus on characterizing the effects of Reynolds number. DLR B (Re\u00a0=\u00a022,800) was found to exhibit a much higher probability of large temporal gradients as compared to DLR A (Re\u00a0=\u00a015,200). While the higher Reynolds number should promote higher fluctuations, the levels were commensurate with an increased effect due to high levels of local flame extinction and re-ignition in DLR B as compared to DLR A. The joint probability density function between the temperature fluctuation and the natural logarithm of the square of the temporal gradient was examined across flame conditions. At an axial position of forty nozzle diameters downstream (x/d\u00a0=\u00a040), DLR A exhibited statistical independence, while DLR B exhibited a negative correlation between the two quantities. These results suggest a Reynolds number-dependence on the spatial development of statistical independence. Integral time scales also are reported for both flames as a function of axial and radial position. The integral time scales are seen to increase with increasing axial and radial position and decrease with increasing Reynolds number as expected from theory.",

Modeling soot formation and transport is challenging due to the complex chemical formation processes, and differential diffusion of soot relative to a flame. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) have highlighted the importance of such transport on soot concentrations, however DNS is computationally expensive. The one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model is able resolve a full range of length and timescales and solves the evolution of diffusive and reactive scalars in the natural physical coordinate. We present results of soot formation in ODT and compare the model to simulation results from DNS in a temporally-evolving planar ethylene jet flame where the same transport, thermodynamic, and kinetic models are applied. Good agreement is found for the jet evolution in terms of the mixture fraction profiles. Conditional soot statistics (mean and fluctuations) are presented, along with joint soot-mixture fraction PDFs that illustrate the location and motion of soot in the mixture fraction coordinate. Good qualitative agreement between the models is found and the soot behavior is similar. While the ODT cannot capture three-dimensional flow structures, the ODT simulations are less computationally expensive than the DNS suggesting its use in conjunction with DNS for parametric study, model validation, and investigation at parameter ranges not currently available to DNS.",

The density ratio of the two streams is of the order 5 and the viscosity of the two streams will also differ. All the flames simulated showed localised extinction in the region around 3\u20135 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle, which is in very good agreement with the experiment. Trends for conditional and unconditional statistics with changing levels of H 2 in the fuel are correctly captured by the LES\u2013CMC method, although different levels of agreement are observed for different species and temperature and possible reasons for this are discussed. The degree of extinction is also correctly predicted to increase as the H 2 content of the jet is reduced, showing the ability of the CMC method to predict complex turbulence-chemistry interaction phenomenon in the presence of changing fuel composition.",

A reduced chemical mechanism, which includes the soot precursor naphthalene, and a high-order method of moments are employed. At the highest Damk\u00f6hler number, local extinction is negligible, while flames holes are observed in the two lowest Damk\u00f6hler number cases. Compared to temperature and other species controlled by fuel oxidation chemistry, naphthalene is found to be affected more significantly by the Damk\u00f6hler number. Consequently, the overall soot mass fraction decreases by more than one order of magnitude for a fourfold decrease of the Damk\u00f6hler number. On the contrary, the overall number density of soot particles is approximately the same, but its distribution in mixture fraction space is different in the three cases. The total soot mass growth rate is found to be proportional to the Damk\u00f6hler number. In the two lowest Da number cases, soot leakage across the flame is observed. Leveraging Lagrangian statistics, it is concluded that soot leakage is due to patches of soot that cross the stoichiometric surface through flame holes. These results show the leading order effects of turbulent mixing in controlling the dynamics of soot in turbulent flames.",

     "abstract": "The effects of combustion on the strain rate field in turbulent jets were studied using 10\u00a0kHz tomographic particle image velocimetry (TPIV). Measurements were performed in three turbulent jets: a well-studied, piloted partially-premixed methane/air jet flame, Sandia flame C, with low probability of localized extinction; a second piloted jet flame, analogous to flame C but with a reduced pilot flow rate and a high probability of localized extinction; and a non-reacting air jet. Since the jet exit Reynolds number of approximately 13000 was nearly identical in the three jets, differences in the strain rate fields were attributed to the effects of combustion. Spatiotemporal characteristics of the strain rate field were analyzed. Overall, the strain rate norm was larger in the flames than in the non-reacting jet with the most stable flame having the largest values. In all three jets, the compressive strain rate was on average the largest of the three principal strain rates. At high strain rates, the ratios of the compressive and extensive strain rate to the intermediate strain rate were similar to those found in isotropic incompressible turbulent flows. The three-dimensional velocity measurements were used to analyze the spatial distribution of strain rate clusters, defined as singly-connected groups of voxels where the strain rate magnitude exceeded a threshold value. The presence of a stable flame significantly attenuated the number of clusters of intermediate strain rate. Strain rate bursts, corresponding to sudden increases in the number of clusters, were identified in the three jets. Bursts in the non-reacting jet and the unstable flame contained up to twice as many clusters as in the stable flame. The temporal intermittency of intense strain rate clusters was analyzed using the time-series measurements. Clusters with strain rates greater than five times the standard deviation of the strain rate norm were highly intermittent.",

The development of accurate models for DME/air flames would establish a foundation for studies of more complex oxygenated fuels. We present a joint experimental and computational investigation of the velocity field and OH and CH2O distributions in a piloted, partially-premixed turbulent DME/air jet flame with a jet exit Reynolds number, ReD, of 29,300. The turbulent DME/air flame is analogous to the well-studied, partially-premixed methane/air jet flame, Sandia Flame D, with identical stoichiometric mixture fraction, \u03best\u00a0=\u00a00.35, and bulk jet exit velocity, Vbulk\u00a0=\u00a045.9\u00a0m/s. Measurements include particle image velocimetry (PIV) and simultaneous CH2O and OH laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) imaging. Simulations are performed using a large eddy simulation combined with conditional moment closure (LES-CMC) on an intermediate size grid of 1.3\u00a0million cells. Overall, the downstream evolution of the mean and RMS profiles of velocity, OH, and CH2O are well predicted, with the largest discrepancies occurring for CH2O at x/D\u00a0=\u00a020\u201325. LES-CMC simulations employing two different chemical reaction mechanisms (Kaiser et al., 2000 [20] and Zhao et al., 2008 [21]) show approximately a factor of two difference in the peak CH2O mole fractions, whereas OH mole fractions are in good agreement between the two mechanisms. The single-shot LIF measurements of OH and CH2O show a wide range of separation distances between the spatial distributions of these intermediate species with gaps on the order of millimeters. The intermittency in the overlap between these species indicates that the consumption rates of formaldehyde by OH in the turbulent DME/air jet flame may be highly intermittent with significant departures from flamelet models.",

The use of a second OH-PLIF sheet, oriented in a crossed-plane imaging configuration enabled conditioning of the statistics with respect to through-plane flame orientation. The statistics show the geometric alignment changes significantly with the distance between the flame and the location where the strain-rate field is evaluated. It was observed that approximately 30\u00a0\u03b7 upstream of the flame, the fluid-dynamic principal strain-rates show no preferential alignment with the flamelet. With increasing proximity to the flame, the most extensive principal strain-rate is observed to align preferentially perpendicular to the local flamelet-normal. In the immediate vicinity of the flame, where local fluid-dynamics are dominated by dilatation, the principal extensive strain-rate is observed to align preferentially parallel to the local flamelet-normal. The realignment of the principal strain-rates in the immediate vicinity of the flame is clearly the result of local flow acceleration caused by heat-release at the reaction zone. As the most extensive principal strain-rate tends to align preferentially perpendicular to the local flamelet-normal outside the region of heat-release, the data indicate that high scalar gradients observed ahead of the flamelet are produced by the local turbulent flow-field, rather than destroyed by it.",

DNS is conducted for hydrogen\u2013air mixture with decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence of which the Reynolds number based on Taylor micro scale is 97.1. The detailed kinetic mechanism including 12 reactive species and 27 elementary reactions is used to represent the hydrogen\u2013air flames. Even for the pressure rising process, the local heat release rate, the flame curvature and the tangential strain rate can be scaled by the maximum laminar heat release rate corresponding to instantaneous mean pressure, the Kolmogorov length scale and the ratio of the turbulent intensity to the Taylor micro scale in the unburned mixture. These facts show a rapid response of flame characteristics to the pressure change. In the propagation process, flame displacement speed is very high compared to open flames due to the expansion of the burned gas. The compression of the unburned mixture due to the high displacement speed increases pressure in the vessel and induces slow decaying or increasing in the turbulent Reynolds number even for no mean flow. It is clarified that the fractal dimension of the flame surface does not show any dependence on pressure increase. The inner cutoff obtained in the pressure rising condition is in good agreement with the expression proposed in our previous study (Shim et al., 2011) [6] where the ratio of the diameter of coherent fine scale eddy, which is a universal fine scale structure of turbulence, to the laminar flame thickness is used as an important parameter.",

Statistics conditioned on the location of the Lagrangian fluid particles relative to the flame showed slight reductions in the strain-rate and vorticity source terms in the flame, indicating that these aspects of the turbulence were attenuated by the flame.

Results for the volumetric dilatation rate as a function of the iso-scalar surface geometry, characterized by the mean and Gauss curvatures, k m and k g , are obtained in several zones (reactants, preheat, reacting and products) of the computational domain. Flat iso-scalar surfaces are the most likely geometries in agreement with previous DNS. The relationship between density and a reaction progress variable, under a low Mach number flamelet assumption, leads to an expression for \u2207 \u00b7 u with contributions from progress variable source and molecular diffusion budget, with a significant contribution from the latter; this approximate expression for the volumetric dilatation rate is studied with DNS results.

We find that individual flame particles as well as their ensemble, experience progressively increasing tangential straining rate (Kt) and increasing negative curvature (\u03ba) near the end of their lifetime to finally get annihilated. By studying two different turbulent flow conditions, flame particle tracking shows that such tendency of local flame surfaces to be strained and cusped towards pinch-off from the main surface is a rather generic feature, independent of initial conditions, locations and ambient turbulence intensity levels. The evolution of the alignments between the flame surface normals and the principal components of the local straining rates are also tracked. We find that the surface normals initially aligned with the most extensive principal strain rate components, rotate near the end of flame particles\u2019 lifetime to enable preferential alignment between the surface tangent and the most extensive principal strain rate component. This could explain the persistently increasing tangential strain rate, sharp negative curvature formation and eventual detachment.",

     "abstract": "Several studies have utilized leading points concepts to explain the sensitivity of turbulent burning rates to fuel/oxidizer composition, especially in negative Markstein length mixtures. Leading point theories suggest that the premixed turbulent flame speed is controlled by the flame front characteristics at the flame brush leading edge, or, in other words, by the flamelets that advance farthest into the unburned mixture (the so-called leading points). Furthermore, several authors have postulated that these leading edge flamelets have an inner structure similar to a critically perturbed laminar flame, i.e., the local stretch rate approaches the extinction value, near where the maximum possible laminar burning velocity is reached.In order to investigate these hypotheses for leading points burning rates, this paper analyzes the flame front structure at the leading edge of turbulent, lean (\u03d5\u00a0=\u00a00.31) premixed H2/Air flames, utilizing a database of direct numerical simulations (DNS) previously reported by Aspden et al. (2011). We calculate local flame front curvature, thickness, and burning velocity and compare these values to reference quantities obtained from stretched laminar flames computed numerically in different geometrical configurations (a counterflow twin flame, a tubular counterflow flame and an expanding cylindrical flame). These comparisons show that curvatures and burning velocities approach those of \u201ccritically\u201d stretched laminar flames for the highest turbulent intensity case, but not for the lower turbulence intensity cases. In all cases, however, the structure of the flame front at the leading edge seems to closely mirror laminar flame calculations.",

We show that in this flame the fuel consumption is greatly enhanced in regions of positive curvature. We also show that the radical pool is enriched throughout the entire flame as Ka is increased.

We have further tracked the motion of the edge points that reside and co-move with the edge of the flame kernel during its evolution in time, and found that within the measurement conditions, on average the persistence time scales of stretch due to pure curvature exceed that due to tangential straining by at least a factor of two.",

This modeling is designed to handle any form of chemical description, Arrhenius or tabulated, as soon as the grid resolution is not too coarse. The closure of the unresolved terms relies on the explicit filtering of their exact expressions computed after an approximate deconvolution of the resolved scalars. A specific numerical treatment is needed to capture the deconvoluted peak burning rate over the coarse LES mesh. The method is first tested in the canonical laminar filtered flame context with two strategies for the unresolved fluxes, which are based either on a full approximate deconvolution, or, on the introduction of a corrective factor applied to the resolved diffusive flux. This factor is dynamically determined from the deconvoluted/filtered burning rates to preserve basic filtered flame front properties (propagation speed and thickness). Then, a three-dimensional turbulent Bunsen flame studied experimentally by Chen et al. (1996) [13] is simulated.",

The consistency issues between flame and flow filter sizes in LES of turbulent premixed flames are discussed in the present article. A general mathematical formalism considering two different filter sizes is proposed. A new closure of the resulting LES balance equations system is derived in the framework of the Filtered TAbulated Chemistry for LES (F-TACLES) formalism.

In the present study, the CSE model is coupled with a two-dimensional flame-generated manifold (FGM) chemistry reduction technique and modified laminar-flame-based probability density function (PDF) and applied to large eddy simulation (LES) of laboratory-scale turbulent premixed flames. CSE estimates conditional moments by solving an inverse problem and uses a conditional moment closure to determine the influence of the unresolved turbulence on the reaction rates. While the CSE model has been used extensively in simulating turbulent non-premixed flames, the study represents a first application of the combustion model to LES of premixed flames. Two axisymmetric Bunsen-type premixed turbulent methane\u2013air flames are examined corresponding to lean and stoichiometric conditions with both lying within the thin reaction zones regime. The LES predictions are compared to available experimental data for the two flames. The predictions of the CSE model are also compared to those of a more traditional flamelet-based approach: the presumed conditional moment (PCM) with flame prolongation of intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds (FPI) tabulated chemistry, or so-called PCM-FPI model. The comparisons of the CSE and PCM-FPI models allow the relative importance of deviations from the standard flamelet assumption to be assessed for flames lying outside the flamelet premixed combustion regime. The performance of CSE for LES of turbulent premixed combustion is evaluated. The CSE combustion model is found to be stable and converges to physically meaningful values. It also yields LES results that agree very well with experiment, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and would seem able to incorporate correctly the influence of turbulent strain on conditionally-filtered quantities and hence burning rate as flame behaviour deviates from that of a flamelet in the thin reaction zones regime.",

The flame is statistically flat and is subjected to an inflow of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. A 35-species and 217-reaction mechanism (Bisetti et al., 2012) [17] is used to represent the chemistry. Two simulations have been performed: one with unity Lewis number to asses the effects of turbulence on the flame structure in the absence of differential diffusion, and the other with non-unity Lewis numbers to analyze how turbulence affects differential diffusion. The Karlovitz numbers are 280 and 220 respectively. The first simulation reveals that the flame is strongly affected by turbulence as enhanced mixing largely thickens the preheat zone. However, the turbulent flame structure (i.e. the correlation between species and temperature) is similar to that of a one-dimensional flat flame, suggesting that turbulence has limited effet on the flame in temperature space, in the absence of differential diffusion. In the second simulation, the flame structure is affected by turbulence, as differential diffusion effects are weakened. It is suggested that this result is attributed to the fact that turbulence drives the effective species Lewis numbers towards unity through an increase in effective species and thermal diffusivities. Finally, the reaction zones of both the unity and the non-unity Lewis number turbulent flames remain thin, and are locally broken (only to some extent for the unity Lewis number flame, and more strongly for non-unity).",

     "abstract": "Shape transitions of swirling flames are often observed in combustion chambers operated at steady flow injection conditions. These transitions may alter pollutant emissions, heat fluxes to the chamber walls or the system stability. In adiabatic combustors, transitions between V and M shapes of swirling flames are controlled by the dynamics of stretched flame elements propagating through the reactants diluted by the burnt products in the outer shear layer of the swirling combustible jet in contact with the hot outer recirculation zone. The impact of H2 concentration in the fuel and of heat loss at the chamber walls modifying the temperature in the outer recirculation zone are analyzed in this study for lean premixed CH4/H2/air flames. Laser induced OH fluorescence in different planes and particle imaging velocimetry are used to determine the probability of V to M shape transitions when the hydrogen concentration or the temperature of the combustor walls are modified. The wall temperatures are determined by laser induced phosphorescence and the temperature in the outer recirculation zone is inferred from thermocouple measurements. It is found that the probability of stabilizing a M flame increases with the H2 concentration in the combustible mixture. For the same laminar burning velocity, the flame featuring a higher extinction limit to strain rate has a higher probability to take a M shape. When combustion is initiated with cold chamber walls, the V to M flame transition probability is reduced compared to a situation with hot walls. During thermal transient and at steady state, it is shown that the temperature of the combustion chamber walls is an important factor controlling these shape transitions due to its impact on the temperature of the burnt gases in the outer recirculation zone. This study confirms that the topology of swirling flames is highly sensitive to heat transfer to the combustion chamber walls.",

First and second order TCMC closures (respectively TCMCI and TCMCII) are proposed and are compared on the lifted methane\u2013air flame experiment of Cabra et al. (2005) [2]. In this configuration, it is shown that the first order model is unable to predict a lifted flame, whereas TCMCII gives correct results in terms of mean composition and temperature. These results are found comparable to those obtained by Michel et al.

On the contrary, conditional flame profiles are different in the lift-off zone, and lift-off height predictions are improved with TCMCII.

     "abstract": "Data obtained in 3D direct numerical simulations of statistically planar, 1D premixed turbulent flames indicate that the global burning velocity, flame surface area, and the mean flame brush thickness exhibit significant large-scale oscillations with time. Analysis of the data shows that the oscillations are caused by origin, growth, and subsequent disappearance of elongated channels filled by unburned gas. The growth of such an unburned mixture finger (UMF), which deeply intrudes into combustion products, is controlled by a physical mechanism of flame-flow interaction that has not yet been highlighted in the turbulent combustion literature, to the best of the present authors knowledge. More specifically, the fingers grow due to strong axial acceleration of unburned gas by local pressure gradient induced by heat release in surrounding flamelets. Under conditions of the present DNS, this physical mechanism plays an important role by producing at least as much flame surface area as turbulence does when the density ratio is equal to 7.5. Although, similarly to the Darrieus-Landau (DL) instability, the highlighted physical mechanism results from the interaction between a premixed flame and pressure field, it is argued that the UMF and the DL instability are different manifestations of the aforementioned interaction. Disappearance of an UMF is mainly controlled by the high-speed self-propagation of strongly inclined flame fronts (cusps) to the leading edge of the flame brush, but significant local increase in displacement speed due to large negative curvature of the front plays an important role also.",

In addition, OH/CH2O imaging was performed in combination with simultaneous Rayleigh scattering thermometry. The CH and HCO layers showed progressive broadening along the axial distance for flames with Reynolds number above 21,000 and the corresponding Karlovitz number above 126. At Reynolds number 40,000 and the corresponding Karlovitz number of 286, a mean CH layer thickness more than 10 times larger than that under laminar condition was observed, providing a clear experimental evidence of distributed reaction zone owing to turbulence/flame interaction. Additionally, spatial correlations between species show that OH and CH2O locate at mutually exclusive regions. In contrast, both CH and HCO can overlap substantially with CH2O. The regions of strong CH/HCO signals correspond to regions with weak CH2O signals. Moreover, CH and HCO are shown to be able to penetrate deeper into the OH layer than CH2O.

     "abstract": "Fuel composition has significant influences on the turbulent flame speed of mixtures with strong stretch sensitivity. These fuels effects are associated with reactant thermal-diffusive properties and stretch sensitivities, causing local variations in the burning rate along the flame front. This study is motivated by leading point descriptions of the turbulent flame speed, which argue that ST is controlled by the flame characteristics at its positively curved leading edge. It has been argued that the leading edge of the flame approaches \u201ccritically stretched\u201d values in thermo-diffusively unstable flames, implying that the appropriate laminar flame speed to parameterize the turbulent flame speed is the maximum flame speed across all potential values of flame stretch, SL,max, as opposed to its unstretched value, SL,0. This paper describes an experimental investigation of the characteristics of the flame leading point in high stretch sensitivity flames to assess this hypothesis more fully. Measurements of the flame curvature were obtained with a low swirl burner (LSB) for several H2/CO mixtures at velocities from 30\u201350\u00a0m/s. These data show that the leading point conditioned curvature statistics are a strong function of the turbulence intensity of the flow. Counter to our expectations, however, the measurements show relatively weak influences of fuel composition on the leading point curvature of the turbulent flame front. As such, these results do not seem consistent with prior arguments that the increased turbulent flame speeds seen with increasing hydrogen content are the result of increasing flame curvature/stretch rates, and therefore SL,max values, at the flame leading points. Additional analysis is needed to understand the physical mechanisms through which the turbulent flame speed is altered by differential diffusion effects.",

Identical Karlovitz numbers are applied to the two flames; however, as the interaction of high turbulence intensity small scale structures with the reaction zones is considered, a significant difference in the effect of the turbulence structures on the inner reaction layer is observed. The heat release rate layer as well as layers of different species reaction rates is found to be more distributed for the H2/air flame compared with those in the CH4/air flame, owing to the difference in the Kolmogorov length scale and the differential diffusion effects. A modified, species-specific Karlovitz number is proposed, where the chemical time scale in the definition is a characteristic species-specific chemical time scale, which is obtained from stationary 1D simulations. The difference between the two flames for different intermediate species corresponds well to the difference in the obtained species-specific Karlovitz numbers. A validation study of the species-specific Karlovitz number is also conducted, where a turbulent effective chemical time scale is quantified for different intermediate species from instantaneous data sets. It is shown that in the preheat zone and reaction zone of the flame, the ratio between the laminar and turbulent chemical time scales of intermediate species corresponds well to the species-specific Karlovitz numbers for the two different flames.",

Blow-off was approached by slowly reducing the fuel flow rate. At conditions far from blow-off, HR occurred along the shear layer, whereas at conditions near blow-off, HR was also observed inside the recirculation zone (RZ). Localised extinctions along the flame front were seen at conditions away from blow-off, and increased in frequency and size as blow-off was approached.

Regions void of OH in the RZ near blow-off were often seen to be filled with CH2O. Regions void of both OH and CH2O were also observed, but less often, indicating the presence of both preheated gases and fresh reactants inside the RZ.

By varying the equivalence ratio we act on the cut-off wavelength and can thus control DL instability. A classification of observed flames into sub/supercritical regimes is achieved through the characterization of their morphology in terms of flame curvature statistics. Numerical low-Mach number simulations of weakly turbulent two-dimensional methane/air slot burner flames are also performed both in the presence or absence of DL instability and are observed to exhibit similar morphological properties.We show that experimental normalized turbulent propane flame speeds S T / S L are subject to two distinct scaling laws, as a function of the normalized turbulence intensity U rms / S L , depending on the sub/supercritical nature of the propagation regime. We also conjecture, based on the experimental results, that at higher values of turbulence intensity a transition occurs whereby the effects of DL instability become shadowed by the dominant effect of turbulence.",

Large eddy simulations are carried out in a complex flow configuration which is turbulent, reactive, transcritical and in the absence or presence of a large-amplitude acoustic motion. The geometry is that of a model scale experimental configuration. Results obtained by exploiting high end computational resources demonstrate the feasibility of such calculations, provide insight in the coupling process, exhibit features which are found in experiments and complement the experimental data. Depending on the acoustic environment (dominated by velocity or pressure oscillations), selective responses of the cryogenic jets and flames can be observed and analyzed. It is found that the flames are more compact when they are made to interact with the transverse acoustic motion and that the dense core length is notably reduced. In the span-wise direction, the flames and dense cores are flattened, a feature which is also found in experiments. The unsteady motion observed experimentally is well retrieved numerically. The simulations highlight the mechanisms that can feed energy in the transverse mode and suggest possible descriptions of the instability driving process. The light methane jet is shaken by the acoustic motion and impacts the dense oxygen stream alternatively on its top and bottom sides. The unsteady heat release rate and the corresponding acoustic Rayleigh term produced by the flames prove to be different according to the flame position regarding the acoustic environment.",

The burner was used in a symmetric twin flame configuration featuring pre-vaporised cyclopentane and JP-10 (exo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene) at equivalence ratios of 0.75 and 0.85. The choice of fuels follows from the practical importance of JP-10 as an aviation fuel with cyclic C5 compounds appearing as breakdown products. The bulk velocity was set to 3.0\u00a0m/s resulting in a turbulent Reynolds number of 120. The obtained data includes conditional velocity statistics, flame curvature information and scalar fluxes. The conversion between conventionally and Favre averaged statistics follows the Bray\u2013Moss\u2013Libby theory and the assumption that finite reaction interface thickness effects can be neglected. The impact of deviations from the latter on statistics is explored and results suggest that the effect is modest for interface thicknesses less than 20% of the turbulent flame brush.

A modification of the standard piloted burner is employed here with the addition of a central tube (inner) carrying fuel that can slide within the existing (outer) tube carrying air. Both tubes are located within the pilot annulus and inhomogeneity is varied by translating the inner tube upstream of the jet exit plane. Two flames with identical overall air/fuel ratios, bulk jet velocities, and pilot conditions but different levels of homogeneity in the fuel/air mixture are selected for detailed investigations. Measurements are performed using Sandia\u2019s Raman\u2013Rayleigh\u2013LIF line facility, and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using the stochastic fields approach are also conducted for the same flames. Results reported here focus on the early stabilization region.The flame with inhomogeneous inlet conditions is more stable being at 57% of blow-off compared to the homogeneous counterpart, which is at 78% of blow-off. It is found that, very close to the jet exit plane, premixed combustion dominates the flame with an inhomogeneous profile. This is in contrast to the homogeneous case, which behaves like a diffusion flame. Further downstream, but still within the pilot region, partial mixing starts to occur between richer samples and hot combustion products. A comparison of the relative conditional scalar dissipation rates, \u03c7r shows that in the upstream region, and within the reactive limits, the homogeneous case has higher values of \u03c7r. Premixed combustion with higher rates of heat release and lower scalar dissipation rates in the near field are therefore key reasons for the improved stability of the flames with inhomogeneous inlets.

Results show an intricate coupling between the flame anchoring and the RZ structure and length. For a fixed fuel composition, at relatively low equivalence ratios, the time-averaged RZ is comprised of two counter rotating eddies: a primary eddy (PE) between the shear layer and the bottom wall; and a secondary eddy (SE) between the vertical step wall and the PE. The flame stabilizes downstream of the saddle point of the dividing streamline between the two eddies. As equivalence ratio is raised, the flame moves upstream, pushing the saddle point with it and reducing the size of the SE. Higher temperature of the products reduces the velocity gradient in the shear layer and thus the reattachment length. As equivalence ratio approaches a critical value, the saddle point reaches the step and the SE collapses while the flame starts to exhibit periodic flapping motions, suggesting a correlation between the RZ structure and flame anchoring. The overall trend in the flow field is the same as we add hydrogen to the fuel at a fixed equivalence ratio, demonstrating the impact of fuel composition on the flow field. We show that the reattachment lengths ( L R ), which are shown to encapsulate the mean RZ structure, measured over a range of fuel composition and equivalence ratio collapse if plotted against the strained consumption speed ( S c ). Results indicate that for the flame to remain anchored, the RZ structure should satisfy L R , isothermal L R , reacting \u00b7 S c U \u221e \u223c 0.1 . If this criterion cannot be met, the flame blows off, flashes back or becomes thermoacoustically unstable, suggesting a Damk\u00f6hler-like criterion for aerodynamic flame stabilization in backward-facing step flows.",

Such constant constraints are achieved by applying a very large high-pressure, dual-chamber explosion facility that is capable of controlling the product of u\u2032LI in proportion to the decreasing \u03bd due to the increase of p. We have found that, contrary to popular scenario for ST enhancement with increasing p at any fixed u\u2032, ST actually decreases similarly as laminar burning velocities (SL) with increasing p in minus exponential manners when values of ReT are kept constant. Moreover, ST increases noticeably with increasing ReT varying from 6700 to 14,200 at any constant p ranging from 1\u00a0atm to 10\u00a0atm. It is found that a better correlation for the normalization of ST is a power-law relation of ST/u\u2032\u00a0=\u00a0aDab, where Da\u00a0=\u00a0(LI/u\u2032)(SL/\u03b4F) is the turbulent Damk\u00f6hler number, \u03b4F\u00a0\u2248\u00a0\u03b1/SL is the laminar flame thickness, and \u03b1 is the thermal diffusivity of unburned mixture.

A stochastic formulation of original MMC is deployed, where mixing of particle scalar values is conditioned on a Markovian reference variable which emulates an implied particle position relative to a flame. The model interactions with the reference variable are controlled through the flamelet localness parameter, \u039b, which is also related to the ratio of diffusive to convective time scales. The model is implemented in a Monte Carlo numerical scheme using detailed GRI3.0 chemical kinetics without adjustments of kinetic coefficients.

     "abstract": "High pressure turbulent premixed flames have been significantly studied in the past decade. The eloquent flame images obtained under high pressure conditions attest the large changes in flame front wrinkling enhanced by the pressure increase. Among the explanation attempts, pressure was assumed to promote Darrieus\u2013Landau (DL) instabilities. More recently the role of the laminar flame thickness was also identified as a key parameter for the flame/turbulence interactions. The objective of the current study is to contribute to this debate by isolating the effects of the suspected parameters. To do so, turbulent methane/air flames are investigated in a high pressure combustion test facility. A multi-grid turbulence promoter system has been developed and implemented to obtain a more intense, isotropic and homogeneous turbulence at the burner exit. The pressure range is 0.1\u20130.4\u00a0MPa, and the mixture composition is varied between ER\u00a0=\u00a00.7 and ER\u00a0=\u00a01.0. Instantaneous flame images have been collected using Mie scattering tomography and exploited to analyze flame\u2013turbulence interactions under controlled conditions. Flame and turbulence parameters have been independently varied under DL instability free conditions to isolate the effect of the laminar flame thickness and that of the small scale turbulence eddies. The stretching of the turbulence energy spectrum towards smaller turbulent length scales is identified as the main reason for the enhanced flame front wrinkling under high pressure flame conditions, together with the reduction of the laminar flame thickness. The Taylor micro-scale appears to be the regulating turbulence scale for flame\u2013turbulence interactions.",

The governing equations are the continuity, momentum, total energy and species transport equations complemented by a real-gas equation of state. The molecular transport model is based on complete mass-diffusion and thermal-diffusion matrices having elements computed according to all-pressure mixing rules. The mixture viscosity and thermal conductivity are calculated from the individual species values, valid at high pressures, by using all-pressure mixing rules. The reaction is a one-step process and the values of different coefficients in the reaction rate ensure that it gives physically-correct trends for autoignition. The DNS is performed for a temporal mixing layer. Three realizations are computed and examined to reveal the influence of the initial pressure p 0 and of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). It is found that the main flame is of diffusion type, flanked by premixed flames. As p 0 increases, the most intensive premixed-flame regions draw closer to the diffusion flame. Additionally to the well-known advantage of EGR, we found that it promotes the development of uphill diffusion which is a molecular process inducing the formation of strong species gradients that in turn induce turbulence production, i.e. the formation of dynamic small scales. Analysis of the irreversible entropy production rate revealed that its four modes \u2013 due to viscosity, mass diffusivity, thermal conductivity and reaction \u2013 operate in different spatial regions of the flow where different phenomena occur. Increasing p 0 and lack of EGR both result in an increase in the magnitude of the irreversible entropy-production rate.

One of the main objectives is to emphasize the progress made in the mathematical description and understanding of reactive spray flows by incorporation of rationally derived simplifications based on the disparity of length and time scales present in the problem. In particular, we aim to show how the disparity of the scales that correspond \u2013 with increasing values of their orders of magnitude \u2013 to the droplet size, interdroplet spacing, and width of the spray jets, ensures the validity of their homogenized description. The two-way coupling associated with exchanges of mass, momentum, and energy between the gas and the liquid phases is dominated by the homogenized exchanges with the gas provided collectively by the droplets, and not by the direct interaction between neighboring droplets. The formulation is used as a basis to address nonpremixed spray diffusion flames in the Burke-Schumann limit of infinitely fast chemical reactions, with the conservation equations written in terms of chemistry-free coupling functions that allow for general nonunity Lewis numbers of the fuel vapor.

We have applied ballistic imaging to the same Diesel fuel injector, under similar conditions, and we find that the images do indicate a structural change when going from subcritical to supercritical conditions. Under subcritical conditions we observe a well-defined liquid/gas interface, surface wave structure, and formation of ligaments and voids. Under supercritical conditions the interface transitions into a continuous, turbulent mixing layer. Images of this layer include the cellular structure characteristic of gas jets.

     "abstract": "The transition of classical spray atomization processes to single-phase continuous dense-fluid mixing dynamics with diminished surface tension forces is poorly understood. Recently, a theory has been presented that established, based on a Knudsen-number criterion, that the development of such mixing layers is initiated because the multicomponent two-phase interface becomes much wider than the mean free molecular path. This shows that the transition to mixing layers occurs due to interfacial dynamics and not, as conventional wisdom had suggested, because the liquid phase has heated up to supercritical temperatures where surface tension forces diminish. In this paper we focus on the dynamics of this transition process, which still poses many fundamental questions. We show that such dynamics are dictated by substantial statistical fluctuations about the average interface molecule number and the presence of significant interfacial free energy forces. The comprehensive analysis is performed based on a combination of non-equilibrium mean-field thermodynamics and a detailed modified 32-term Benedict\u2013Webb\u2013Rubin mixture state equation. Statistical fluctuations are quantified using the generally accepted model of Poisson-distributions for variances in systems with a small number of molecules. Such fluctuations quantify the range of pressure and temperature conditions under which the gradual transition to dense-fluid mixing dynamics occurs. The interface begins to deteriorate as it broadens substantially. The related interfacial free energy forces do not instantly diminish only because vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium conditions do not apply anymore. Instead, such forces along with the present interfacial statistical fluctuations are shown to gradually decrease as the interface transitions through the molecular chaos regime and to diminish once the interface enters the continuum regime. Then, the interfacial region becomes a continuous gas\u2013liquid mixing layer with diminished free energy forces that is significantly affected by single-phase real-fluid thermodynamics and transport properties.",

Ejected from a spray nozzle with a high speed, a liquid-fuel jet deforms and the fuel spray is atomized into many ligaments and droplets. During these processes, the gas flow becomes turbulent due to droplet/ligament dynamics. At the same time, droplet evaporation and mixing with ambient air are affected by the small-scale gas turbulence. An understanding of the mixing characteristics in the dense spray zone is important for modeling spray combustion. In a region where the droplet number density is relatively low, a universal feature of isotropic turbulence was found, although the alignments of strain eigenvectors with vorticity and the mixture fraction gradient are slightly modulated by the presence of droplets, which is a characteristic of particle-laden flows. In gas-phase regions close to droplet surfaces, where the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy is strongly increased, the alignments are more modulated, especially those of the scalar gradient with strain eigenvectors. This can also be seen in the topology similarity among energy dissipation, enstrophy and scalar dissipation in the near field of droplet/ligament surfaces. For the first time, it is found that droplets whose size is comparable to turbulence scales do affect the mixing characteristics in a realistic turbulent spray. This finding has shed new light upon the modeling of flow turbulence and scalar mixing in an evaporating and atomizing fuel spray.",

     "abstract": "Imaging has long shown that under some high-pressure conditions, the presence of discrete two-phase flow processes becomes diminished. Instead, liquid injection processes transition from classical sprays to dense-fluid jets with no drops present. When and how this transition occurs, however, was not well understood until recently. In this paper, we summarized a new theoretical description that quantifies the effects of real fluid thermodynamics on liquid fuel injection processes as a function of pressure at typical Diesel engine operating conditions. We then apply the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) technique coupled with real-fluid thermodynamics and transport to analyze the flow at conditions when cylinder pressures exceed the thermodynamic critical pressure of the injected fuel. To facilitate the analysis, we use the experimental data posted as part of the Engine Combustion Network (see www.sandia.gov/ECN); namely the \u201cSpray-A\u201d case. Calculations are performed by rigorously treating the experimental operating conditions. Numerical results are in good agreement with available experimental measurements. The high-fidelity simulation is then used to analyze the details of transient mixing and understand the processes leading to auto-ignition. The analysis reveals the profound effect of supercritical fluid phenomena on the instantaneous three-dimensional mixing processes. The large density ratio between the supercritical fuel and the ambient gas leads to significant penetration of the jet with enhanced turbulent mixing at the tip and strong entrainment effects. Using detailed chemistry, a map of the auto-ignition delay time was calculated in simulation results. This map shows that a large flammable region with low velocity and mixture gradients is generated 250 diameters downstream of the injector. In the experiment, the first ignition site is observed at this location. This correspondence seems to indicate that the ignition location is piloted by the efficient mixing operating at the extremity of the jet coupled with long residence times, low strain rates and low scalar gradients.",

Ferrofluids under external alternating magnetic field heat up themselves due to the magnetic Brownian relaxation mechanism. Under the condition of very large magnetic power compared to the thermal power provided by heat transfer from the gas phase, the magnetic heat source together with the heat transfer from the gas phase impose a thermal boundary layer adjacent to the droplet surface in the liquid side and the temperature presents a maximum inside the droplet, not at the surface. Since the transport coefficient increases significantly with a dispersion of a small quantity of nanoparticles, the heat transfer from the thermal boundary layer to the droplet core increases. Then the temperature of that region increases faster comparing to the case without nanoparticle dispersion. The temperature inside the thermal boundary layer increases slower because of the heat transfer to the droplet core as well as to the droplet surface. Therefore, the boiling condition which is found inside the thermal boundary layer is reached later when considering effective thermal conductivity. The droplet vaporization rate is augmented by the heat transfer from the thermal boundary layer to the droplet surface. In addiction, the strong dependence of the magnetic relaxation mechanism on temperature imposes a dependence of the vaporization rate on the initial condition of the problem.",

Here, a large eddy simulation (LES) methodology combined with a probability density function (PDF) approach is used to simulate a series of methanol spray flames. To account for the small-scale interaction between spray droplets and the gas-phase combustion process, a stochastic model is proposed. Detailed chemical kinetics is used along with in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) to accelerate the computations. The simulations produce very good agreement with experimental data. From the LES computations, it is postulated that the ignition process happens through two different mechanisms: an entrainment process that traps droplets in high-temperature oxidizer pockets, and a stratified premixed process. It is shown that without the explicit model for the spray/combustion coupling, a more premixed propagation is observed due to the artificial mixing induced by the algorithm. Finally, it is shown that increased subfilter mixing leads to a reduction in peak temperatures, where ignition kernels are dissipated quickly.",

By considering different initial droplet diameters and through comparisons with turbulent and laminar configurations at the same operating condition, it is shown that preferential concentration can lead to conditions of locally high mixture-fraction composition. In addition, local variability in strain rate and droplet diameter introduces a bifurcation of the spray flame. This bifurcation consists of spray flame structures exhibiting single-reaction or double-reaction structures. It is shown that this bimodal behavior is linked to the existence of a hysteresis in the laminar spray flame structure for droplet diameter variations, as well as the occurrence of a bifurcation for strain rate variations.

Comparisons of the predicted gas phase and droplet statistics with measurements show a good agreement confirming that the droplet dispersion and evaporation models used in this work are adequate. The general features of the spray flame such as the occurrence of external group combustion and its development into separate combusting islands are well captured.",

     "abstract": "Recent interest in alternative and bio-derived fuels has emphasized butanol over ethanol as a result of its higher energy density, lower vapor pressure and more favorable gasoline blending properties. Numerous efforts have examined the combustion of butanol from the perspective of low dimensional gas-phase transport configurations that facilitate modeling and validation of combustion kinetics. However, fewer studies have focused on multiphase butanol combustion, and none have appeared on isolated droplet combustion that couples experiments with robust modeling of the droplet burning process. This paper presents such an experimental/numerical modeling study of isolated droplet burning characteristics of n-butanol. The experiments are conducted in an environment that simplifies the transport process to one that is nearly one-dimensional as promoted by burning in a reduced gravity environment. Measurements of the evolution of droplet diameter (Do\u00a0=\u00a00.56\u20130.57\u00a0mm), flame standoff ratio (FSR\u00a0\u2261\u00a0Df/D) and burning rate (K) are made in the standard atmosphere under reduced gravity and the data are compared against numerical simulation. The detailed model is based on a comprehensive time-dependent, sphero-symmetric droplet combustion simulation that includes spectrally resolved radiative heat transfer, multi-component diffusive transport, full thermal property variations and detailed chemical kinetic. The simulations are carried out using both a large order kinetic mechanism (284 species, 1892 reactions) and a reduced order mechanism (44 species, 177 reactions). The results show that the predicted burning history and flame standoff ratios are in good agreement with the measurements for both the large and reduced order mechanisms. Additional simulations are conducted for varying oxygen concentration to determine the limiting oxygen index and to elucidate the kinetic processes that dictate the extinction of the flame at these low oxygen concentrations.",

     "abstract": "Recently, large diameter, isolated n-heptane droplet experiments under microgravity conditions (aboard the International Space Station) exhibited \u201cCool Flame\u201d burning behavior, resulting from a heat loss mechanism that extinguishes hot combustion and a transition into a sustained, low temperature second stage combustion. In atmospheric pressure air, a single combustion mode transition to \u201cCool Flame\u201d burning is followed by diffusive extinction. But with increasing pressure, multiple cycles of hot initiation followed by transition to \u201cCool Flame\u201d burning are observed. This paper reports experimental observations that characterize the transition time histories of this multi-cycle, multi-stage behavior. Transient sphero-symmetric droplet combustion modeling that considers multi-stage detailed kinetics, multi-component diffusion, and spectral radiation is applied to analyze the experimental observations. The simulations indicate that as parameters change the chemical time scales dictating low temperature degenerate chain branching, multiple hot/cool flame burning transitions are induced by increasing the cool flame burning heat generation rate compared to the diffusive loss rate. The balance of these terms in the negative temperature coefficient kinetic regime defines whether reactions accelerate into re-ignition of a hot flame event, burn quasi-steadily in the cool flame mode, or diffusively extinguish. The rate of reactions controlling ketohydroperoxide formation and destruction are shown to be key re-ignition of hot combustion from the cool flame mode. Predictions are found to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Modeling is further applied to determine how these observations are dependent on initial experimental conditions, including pressure, and diluent species.",

     "abstract": "This study reports experimental evidence of gas phase micro-convection induced by support fibers used in droplet combustion experimentation. Soot aggregates formed during combustion of n-octane and n-decane droplets (initial diameters ranging from 0.5 mm to 5 mm) provide natural seeds to reveal the thermal and flow asymmetries involved. The experiments are carried out in an environment that reduces the influence of forced and buoyant convection for both free-floating (unsupported) and fiber-supported droplets. Under these conditions, the soot trapping patterns (due to a balance of thermophoretic and flow-induced drag) would be spherical. However, this situation is only observed for unsupported droplets, or for fiber-supported droplets when the fiber is small relative to the droplet diameter. For Do < 1 mm a ground based drop tower employed two 14 \u03bcm diameter SiC fibers to fix the droplet\u2019s position during burning; unsupported droplets were also examined. For Do > 1 mm the International Space Station provided capabilities for anchoring test droplets onto a single 80 \u03bcm SiC fiber, and for deploying unsupported droplets. Results clearly indicate that a non-symmetric gas flow field exists in some cases (i.e., for 1 mm < Do < 3 mm, with an 80 \u03bcm fiber) near to where the fiber enters the droplet. This gas motion originates from the presence of the fiber that introduces asymmetries in the temperature and flow fields resulting in localized force imbalances on the soot particles, which cause vortical flow patterns near the fiber. This may in part be explained by flow asymmetries induced by droplet shape distortions coupled with heat exchanges between the fiber and surrounding gas and conduction into the droplet, resulting in a Marangoni flow near the droplet surface. For very small fibers (or for unsupported droplets) spherical soot shells are found suggesting that no thermal and flow asymmetries exist.",

Numerical simulations were performed by using a detailed reaction mechanism containing 175 species and 1086 reactions with PAH formation up to pyrene and a sectional soot model. The soot model consists of inception as a result of the collision of two pyrene molecules, heterogeneous surface growth and oxidation following the hydrogen abstraction acetylene addition (HACA) mechanism, and soot particle coagulation and PAH surface condensation. Comparisons with available experimental data indicate that the numerical model reproduces successfully the influence of pressure on the flame structure and soot production. All the soot formation processes are enhanced with increasing pressure and HACA dominates the soot mass growth over the pressure range considered. PAH condensation is the most sensitive process to pressure whereas the inception and HACA processes exhibit similar pressure dependency. These trends are directly related to the pressure dependence of the molar concentrations of the species involved in soot formation. The increase in the molar concentrations of benzene and pyrene with pressure results from both physical and chemical effects. Propargyl recombination and interconversion of phenyl to benzene dominate the formation of benzene low in the flame over the pressure range considered, though the contributions of the addition of acetylene to n-butadienyl radical increases significantly with pressure in the flame centerline region.",

This work follows a study of the same flames made using electron-ionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (EI-MBMS). Temperature profiles have been measured using a thermocouple with and without the probe and compared with those obtained during EI-MBMS experiments, showing the important influence of the probe geometry. The mole fraction profiles above the burner of numerous products and intermediates (31 for MF, 40 for DMF) have been quantified, including all the isomers which were globalized during EI-MBMS experiments, as well as some heavier aromatic products such as ethylbenzene and styrene. The profiles of these aromatics confirmed their significantly enhanced formation in the case of DMF compared to MF, which was already shown in the previous study. The model of the oxidation of these two substituted furans have been up-dated to include new reactions for the formation of C8 aromatics, as well as reactions proposed in literature for large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) formation. Simulations show a significant enhancement effect on the formation of PAH, such as pyrene or phenanthrene: their maximum mole fractions are increased by a factor of more than 400 in the DMF flame compared to that of MF, while it is only a factor 3 in the case of benzene. Simulations show that PAH mole fractions are also slightly larger in the DMF flame than in a flame of a gasoline surrogate containing toluene as an octane improver under the same conditions. However the PAH mole fractions in the DMF flame are significantly lower than in a flame of pure toluene, showing that this biofuel could be an interesting octane improver in replacement of aromatics.",

A detailed kinetic model consisting of 236 species and 1331 reactions was developed and validated against the measured mole fraction profiles of flame species. According to the rate of production analysis, o-xylene mainly decomposes via radical attack reactions, including the H-abstraction and ipso-addition reactions. o-Xylyl radical is yielded from the H-abstraction of o-xylene, and is a key intermediate leading to the formation of smaller species. In the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the structure of adjacent methyl groups facilitates the formation of bicyclic aromatic species such as indane and 1,4-dihydronaphthalene, and leads to several fuel-specific pathways for the formation of indene and naphthalene in o-xylene combustion. Consequently, relatively high concentration levels of small PAHs are produced in o-xylene combustion while phenyl and benzyl radicals cannot be sufficiently produced, which explains the comparable sooting tendency of o-xylene to those of toluene and ethylbenzene.",

In all substances studied in the temperature ranges from 1800\u20132000\u00a0K to 2500\u20133000\u00a0K, a sharp fall in soot size accompanied by a sharp increase in the rate of their formation was observed. Analysis of the data obtained showed that the decrease of soot particle size and decrease in total time of their formation with the temperature rise obey similar exponential dependencies, which could be qualitatively correlated with an increase in the rate of decomposition of the initial carbon bearing molecules. It is established that the observed decrease in the total time of soot particle growth with increased temperature is caused by a decrease in their final size, and the decrease of extinction at 633\u00a0nm reflects not a reduction of soot yield, but a decrease in the extinction coefficient upon the reduction of soot particle size. Extinction measurements on a shorter wavelength (220\u00a0nm and 248\u00a0nm) indicated an approximately constant soot yield in the specified temperature range.",

To identify the major contributors to the molecular growth mechanism in opposed-flow flames, we employed flame-sampling molecular-beam mass spectrometry with electron ionization (EI) and in situ gas-chromatography (GC) with mass spectrometric detection. The EI and GC-EI mass spectra indicate that several pathways with different building blocks can contribute to molecular growth. Besides the commonly accepted hydrogen-abstraction-C2H2-addition steps, we found reactions of the methyl radical to be important steps. This observation is also supported by the complexity of the mass spectra which indicates that at least one of the building blocks is rather small. The importance of phenyl radicals as building blocks seems to be limited. We also sampled nascent soot particles from premixed atmospheric-pressure flames of the above mentioned fuels and used helium-ion microscopy to unravel the influence of the fuel structure on the morphology of the sampled particles. While differences in flame temperatures and residence times are known to influence the particle sizes, the observed different morphologies are likely due to slightly different C/O ratios and potentially the chemical nature of the fuel.",

A sectional modeling approach is used to predict particle formation and burnout.Two counterflow diffusion flames have been chosen, a soot formation (SF) and a soot formation/oxidation (SFO) flame.Experimental data supported by model predictions show the role of fragmentation in controlling the burn-out and the size distribution of particles in flames. SF flame, where no soot oxidation occurs, shows large particles.

     "abstract": "Given the upcoming EURO 6 regulations, which include limits on particle number density (and hence size) for soot emissions from land vehicles, soot models must be capable of accurately predicting soot particle sizes. Previous modeling work has demonstrated the importance of the relative strengths of nucleation and condensation in predicting soot primary particle size; however, fundamental models still rely on tunable constants for modeling both processes, which limits predictive capability. Recent investigations into nucleation and condensation processes suggest that both processes are not thermodynamically favored to occur from 5-ringed PAHs, yet 5-ringed PAHs have been experimentally observed in abundance within nascent soot particles. This contradiction leads to the understanding that nucleation and condensation from 5-ringed PAHs is plausible, although they are likely highly reversible processes.A fundamental reversible model for nucleation and condensation is developed through the use of statistical mechanics and the results from several recent works. The model is highly sensitive to both the binding energy and the vibration frequencies created during the nucleation and condensation processes, although reasonable values are obtained through an extensive literature review. A model for tracking the PAHs on the surface of soot particles is developed, which allows for the calculation of the reverse rate of nucleation and condensation. The inclusion of reversibility in the nucleation and condensation subroutines enables the model to accurately reproduce all relevant soot morphological parameters determined experimentally for the atmospheric pressure, laminar, ethylene\u2013air Santoro flame. This is due to more accurate partitioning of PAH mass through the nucleation and condensation processes. The developed reversible model represents an advancement in fundamental soot formation modeling by replacing tunable constants with fundamental physics.",

What are, if any, the differences between inception particles formed in non-sooting and sooting flames, and to what extent soot formation is governed primarily by coagulation or by a different composition/aromatization of inception particles are open questions.In this work, the initial particle growth occurring in premixed flames of ethylene has been investigated. On line size-selected photoionization efficiency of inception particles produced in various flames has been measured. Structural/chemical differences of both nucleating and growing particles have been additionally investigated by off-line cyclic voltammetry, Raman spectroscopy, and light absorption.Results show that the size of aromatic domains within particles slightly increases when moving from flames in which the particle size distribution remains nearly constant and mono-modal in the nanometer range along the flame height, to flames in which particle coagulation gives rise to the formation of a second mode constituted by larger but still nanometric particles. Only in particles of this latter mode, d\u00a0\u2248\u00a010\u00a0nm, the first appearance of stacking of polyaromatic units is observed.On this basis, it has been hypothesized that two graphitization processes occur during the first stages of soot inception: a slight increase of in plane aromatic islands in primary particles and the formation of aromatic plane stacks in coagulated primary particles. This second type of coagulating-graphitization process explains the closure of the band gap observed in the grown particles respect to the primary ones, and hence the change of optical properties, towards the typical values observed in soot.",

The measurement of the aliphatic and aromatic hydrogen content of soot has shown to give useful insights in the different dehydrogenation and soot mass growth processes observed for the methane and ethylene flame. In the ethylene flame, aliphatic hydrogen is preferentially and almost completely removed in the early soot formation region and the reduction of soot formation rate was observed after the aliphatic hydrogen decrease. This can be attributed to the decrease of radical sites formation and the consequent loss of surface reactivity toward further carbon addition. Downstream of the soot formation region, coagulation and thermal annealing of the ethylene soot particles, accompanied by a negligible dehydrogenation, become the predominant phenomena. The corresponding steep rise of the absorption coefficient is a signature of the increase of aromatic structures interconnected by conjugated sp2 bonds, marking the end of soot formation and growth process. In the methane flame, the decrease of aliphatic hydrogen was found to occur to a lower extent and delayed in respect to the maximum soot formation rate. The reduced soot dehydrogenation observed in the methane flame was attributed to the lower [H]/[H2] ratio, as testified by the larger presence of molecular hydrogen, which reduces the number of radical sites necessary for soot dehydrogenation and aromatic growth. In this condition, the later phases of coagulation and internal structural carbon rearrangements did not significantly occur, as demonstrated by the low value and steadiness of the methane soot absorption coefficient.",

The concept of solvent-excluded surface, which is widely used for proteins, forms the basis of this scheme. The scheme is used to provide insights into the surface reactivity in terms of the surface availability of active atoms and sites for different gaseous species. It was found that the surface availability of active sites varies with gaseous species, system temperature and particle size. The number of active sites available for a small gaseous species is always greater than that for a large species. Surface exposure increases with an increase in temperature and an obvious enhancement exists when transforming to liquid-like configurations. The surface availability decreases with increasing particle size following a linear relation with reciprocal size. The parameter \u03b1, which is used in the soot literature to empirically quantify surface reactivity, was further estimated in the context of HACA mechanism and was approximately 0.8\u223c0.9 for reactions between soot particles and acetylene. By exploring one particular pocket on the surface of a coronene cluster with 100 molecules, it was noted that it is feasible for both oxygen and acetylene molecules to penetrate inside the cluster in principle.

We recorded aerosol mass spectra at different distances from the fuel outlet for fixed ionization energies and in a fixed position while tuning the photoionization energy. The mass spectra contain a large distribution of peaks, highlighting the importance of small building blocks and showing a variety of chemical species that extends beyond the traditional classification of PAHs based on thermodynamic stability. In addition, we performed stochastic simulations of PAH growth in the flame in order to provide better insight into the chemical composition of species associated with peaks in the measured mass spectra. These simulations were conducted using a stochastic nanoparticle simulator (SNAPS). Synthesis of experimental and simulated results showed that peaks in the observed mass spectra generally consisted of a mixture of PAH isomers. At m/z\u00a0=\u00a0154 and 202, for example, experiments and simulations suggested that additional isomers than biphenyl and pyrene are important. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of odd-carbon numbered species and complex growth paths. The experimental results suggest that species of higher masses can build up concentration ahead of species of lower masses. Our experimental results show, for example, that the peak at m/z\u00a0=\u00a0278 appears closer to the burner outlet than the peak at m/z\u00a0=\u00a0202, i.e., suggesting that a single monotonic growth mechanism is not enough.",

Particle nucleation significantly impacts the formation and morphology of soot particles, yet remains a key knowledge gap. To elucidate the process of nucleation, we have investigated the thermodynamic stability of dimers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), towards developing a more comprehensive model for PAH clustering behavior. Using a computational methodology based on molecular dynamics and well-tempered Metadynamics, we quantified the impact of morphological parameters on homo-molecular dimerization, as well as the relative size of monomers on the stability of hetero-molecular dimers. The results illustrated the substantial impact of PAH mass and geometry on the stability of homo-molecular and hetero-molecular dimers at flame temperatures. In particular, dimer stability was found to depend most strongly on monomer mass, followed by solvent-accessible surface area. Additionally, hetero-molecular dimer stability was found to be largely determined by the size of the smallest monomer. Identifying relationships between PAH morphology and thermodynamic stability is a significant step towards a more comprehensive understanding of the physical interactions between PAHs.

Analyses of the PAH products by high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode-array ultraviolet\u2013visible absorbance and mass-spectrometric detection reveal vast differences in the growth behavior of the two dopants. In the case of 2-methylnaphthalene, growth is virtually limited to the two- and three-ring PAH that result from 2-naphthylmethyl\u2019s reactions with methyl, ethylene, propene, and 1-butene\u2014all abundant in the n-decane pyrolysis environment. In the case of 1-methylnaphthalene, the methyl group\u2019s attachment to a carbon that is just-adjacent to a \u201cvalley\u201d carbon of the naphthalene structure permits 1-naphthylmethyl\u2019s reaction with ethylene to form phenalene, an unstable C13H10 PAH that readily loses hydrogen to form the resonance-stabilized phenalenyl radical. This radical sets in motion a sequence for PAH growth that involves reactions of the C2\u2013C4 1-alkenes with both phenalenyl-type radicals and arylmethyl radicals (whose methyl group is attached to a carbon that is just-adjacent to a valley carbon)\u2014producing unsubstituted PAH and methylated PAH of successively higher ring number. As a consequence of these reactions, even though the dopant 1-methylnaphthalene undergoes only 4.5% conversion, it selectively increases (by up to a factor of four) the yields of many of n-decane\u2019s favored four- to eight-ring PAH products\u2014demonstrating the prevalence of the arylmethyl/alkene/phenalenyl reaction mechanism in the supercritical n-decane pyrolysis environment.",

     "abstract": "In this work we investigate nascent soot particles by analyzing laser-induced incandescence (LII) signals obtained in low-sooting premixed flames. The analysis covers two data sets obtained in separate experimental campaigns. The first data set was obtained in a previous work (Mouton et al., 2013) in methane/oxygen/nitrogen flames (equivalence ratio range 1.95\u00a0<\u00a0\u03a6\u00a0<\u00a02.32) at 26.7\u00a0kPa, whereas the second was performed in atmospheric ethylene/air flames (1.77\u00a0<\u00a0\u03a6\u00a0<\u00a02.00). Both studies show similar trends, i.e. a gradual change of the fluence curves (evolution of the LII signal as function of the laser fluence) from the well-known S-shaped curve for mature soot found at high heights above the burner (HAB) and high equivalence ratio, to a nearly linear behavior for nascent soot found at low HAB and reduced equivalence ratio. With this change comes a decrease in the LII decay time (and hence inferred particle size). Also, this decay time appears to be almost constant with HAB in flames having the lowest equivalence ratio at which the incandescence signal could be detected. In these flames, so-called nucleation flames, the stability of the particle size with HAB suggests that recently nucleated particles have undergone marginal surface growth and coagulation. Existence of such nucleation flames is of great interest for improving the theoretical description of the nucleation step. Experimental results are analyzed by using a theoretical model for LII to determine the particle size evolution throughout the flame at various experimental conditions. We highlight the size difference from nascent soot particles up to mature soot, giving insight into the particle nucleation and the surface growth processes as a function of reaction time and flame conditions.",

     "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms of soot formation, growth, oxidation, and emission is important for diverse reasons including better combustor design, quantifying soot\u2019s contribution to climate change, and mitigating air quality concerns. Instantaneous soot measurement in turbulent flames is difficult, and has mostly been restricted to high-momentum jet flames and pool fires. The current work partially fills this gap by presenting simultaneous measurements of soot volume fraction (fv), effective aggregate radius of gyration (Rgm1), and primary particle diameter (dp) in combination with separately-acquired measurements of mean gas velocity, within a range of turbulent buoyant non-premixed jet flames burning a fuel mixture representative of associated gas flares in the upstream oil and gas industry. Fifteen cases comprising six possible nozzle exit velocities and four nozzle diameters were studied. Histograms of fv and dp support the suggestion that reduced fv near the flame tip results from increased soot intermittency rather than reduced local fv. Furthermore, the data indicate that oxidation of mature soot structures occurs rapidly and completely, and is insensitive to the local fv. For most conditions studied, centerline fv shows self-similar behavior when scaled by measured flame height in the axial direction. The more buoyancy-dominated flames show a marked increase in peak fv that occurs lower in flame-length-normalized coordinates, while the more momentum-dominated flames show a decreased peak fv that occurs higher in flame-length-normalized coordinates. Low in the flame, soot is only present in an annular region where fv, dp, and Rgm1 all grow. Once soot is present on the centerline, dp growth slows and dp is relatively constant at all radial locations and all conditions higher in the flame. Aggregate size continues to grow steadily with increased flame height and correlates well with residence time when adjusted to account for differing flow fields close to the burner outlet.",

The dominant reaction channel in all three cases is elimination of the oxygen atom from peroxy complexes formed at the initial O2 addition step and leading to the phenoxy and naphthoxy radical products. The contribution of this channel increases with temperature. Chemically-activated phenoxy and naphthoxy radicals either decompose to the cyclopentadienyl\u00a0+\u00a0CO and indenyl\u00a0+\u00a0CO products, respectively, or undergo thermal equilibration. The relative yields of the decomposition/equilibration products strongly depend on temperature and pressure in the way that a temperature growth favors decomposition, whereas an increase in pressure favors equilibration. At the lowest temperature considered, 1500\u00a0K, the reactions also yield significant amounts of pyranyl\u00a0+\u00a0CO (phenyl\u00a0+\u00a0O2) or 1-benzopyranyl\u00a0+\u00a0CO (1-naphthyl\u00a0+\u00a0O2). A comparison of the phenyl\u00a0+\u00a0O2 and naphthyl\u00a0+\u00a0O2 reactions reveals that although the general trends in the oxidation kinetics of phenyl and naphthyl radicals are similar, the size and especially the position of the radical site in the aromatic moiety may affect the details of the mechanism and relative product yields.",

The low-pressure flame was permanently blue, whereas the high-pressure one was under conditions of incipient sooting. Both flames had nominally identical temperature\u2013time history. Using gas sampling through quartz microprobes followed by GC/MS analysis and addressing potential artifacts associated with the diagnostic intrusiveness and probe-induced chemistry, we demonstrated that the flame structure was resolved even at the highest pressures, as shown by the good agreement with respect to major species between the experimental results and a one-dimensional computational model of the flame with detailed chemistry and transport. The increase in soot propensity correlates with an increase in the concentration of soot precursors like the aromatics and acetylene. Comparison with model predictions shows that the concentration of aromatics is systematically overpredicted. An ancillary computational study to estimate the sensitivity to changes in the velocity boundary conditions showed that minor species like the aromatics are sensitive to these details under certain conditions, because of changes in the temperature\u2013time history that affects predominantly the slow chemistry.",

Especially very small, below ten nanometer-sized, particles in the early stages of the soot nucleation process are interesting targets for more detailed inspection, to reveal useful insight and to guide further model development. In this study, Helium-ion microscopy (HIM) is applied as an imaging technique new to combustion studies to analyze the morphology of soot particles >2\u00a0nm and to determine their geometrical characteristics. For this analysis, a series of premixed ethylene flames are investigated. Mobility size measurements from an earlier investigation have been compared with the particle sizes determined by HIM. Observed particle shapes and geometrical statistics suggest that in all flames under investigation, nascent soot possesses no well-defined morphologies.

The kinetics of particle oxidation was measured through electric mobility measurement of particle size distributions before and after oxidation. It was found that the specific oxidation rate is has a first-order dependency on gas-phase O2 concentration over the range of O2 concentration studied. The rate measured is an order of magnitude larger than that predicted by the classical Nagle Strickland-Constable (NSC) correlation.

The layer length obtained by means of MA approach was found to be higher in respect to the layer length derived from AP method, as it better accounts for their local curvature and distortion. The mean layer length obtained by the MA method was then proved to agree well with the data evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, the MA method was useful for extracting other soot nanostructural parameters related to the geometry of individual fringes as layer length, tortuosity, and local curvature radii, in turn correlated with the defective nature of soot structure.Some parameters provided by the MA method appeared to be more sensitive and informative about structural changes occurring as soot is formed. In particular, the percentage of fringes with high tortuosity and the percentage of nearly-straight fragments were found to decrease and increase, respectively, throughout the soot formation region. These trends suggested a better stacking of longer and more planar layers testifying the structural order improvement with soot aging. It was also observed that the soot nanostructural ordering occurred faster for benzene with respect to ethylene soot in agreement with H/C and absorption coefficients trends.The distributions of carbon in differently-sized aromatic structures were evaluated on the basis of the fringe length distribution to follow the aromatic growth. The method assigned aromatic sizes to the extracted HRTEM fringes, assuming that the fringes are in the shape of parallelograms. The distributions were found to evolve toward larger size aromatic systems demonstrating the occurrence of aromatic growth during soot formation.",

     "abstract": "A detailed knowledge of soot formation and oxidation processes is desired to reduce the soot emissions in combustion devices. Soot oxidation is one of the most complex processes in the numerical modeling of soot. In this work, the oxidation of soot has been numerically studied in laminar ethylene/air coflow diffusion flames. There has been disagreement in the literature over the rates of soot oxidation by O2 molecules and OH radicals. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the roles of O2 and OH in various parts of the diffusion flame, isolating the effects these species have on soot oxidation. A new oxidation model is developed based on the observation that soot ageing reduces surface reactivity and is primarily based on temperature and residence time. A function for surface reactivity of soot, based on the temperature history a soot particle experiences, has been proposed to model soot oxidation. Using this new model, it is now possible to capture the correct behavior of both smoking and non-smoking flames in various flame configurations. Along with a detailed sectional soot model, the new oxidation model predicts the correct soot volume fractions, smoke emission characteristics, and primary particle diameters for different flames without any variation in model parameters between cases.",

Throughout the combustion process, soot aggregates from the combustion of TRF20 generally exhibited more primary particles and larger-sized clusters than the n-heptane soot aggregates. Despite the different fuel formulations, both n-heptane and TRF20 showed similar trends during the combustion process in terms of changes in fractal dimension of soot aggregates, mean primary particle size and nanostructure (as characterized by fringe length, separation distance and tortuosity). The presence of toluene, however, led to a decrease in the fractal dimensions of the aggregates and a concurrent increase in the mean size of primary particles. Moreover, in the same combustion stages, the mean fringe length for the TRF20 soot was smaller than that for the n-heptane soot, while the mean separation distance and tortuosity for the TRF20 soot were both larger than those for the n-heptane soot.

A stoichiometric Hydrogen/Oxygen mixture with different diluents (Argon and Nitrogen) is considered to assess effects of the mixture composition and reactivity on the initiation process. It is found that the mixture reactivity and the spatio-temporal evolution of the diffracted detonation wave are critical in controlling the development of the ignition kernels, and the possible transition to detonation. Due to curvature effects and the increasing shock angle, the incident shock wave transitions from a regular reflection to a Mach reflection. Through parametric studies, it is shown that for more reactive Argon-diluted mixtures, ignition first appears behind the regular shock reflection, which is followed by spontaneous re-initiation through the SWACER (Shock Wave Amplification by Coherent Energy Release) mechanism. By replacing Argon with Nitrogen, the reactivity reduces and re-ignition through Mach reflection is observed. The subsequent re-initiation is primarily controlled by flame-acoustic and wave-wave interactions. Hot-spot re-initiation behind the Mach stem is not found due to the short ignition window that exists over the limited range of shock angles. A theoretical model is developed to confirm these findings and to quantify the coupling among the incident shock angle, the thermodynamic state of the shock-compressed mixture, and the ignition delay. Effects of viscous-diffusive transport are also assessed, and it is shown that the viscous dissipation at the wall promotes ignition and transition to re-initiation.",

     "abstract": "Experiments were carried out to investigate the failure mechanisms in the critical tube diameter phenomenon for stable and unstable mixtures. It was previously postulated that in unstable mixtures where the detonation structure is highly irregular, the failure during the diffraction is caused by the suppression of the instability responsible for the generation of local explosion centers. In stable mixtures, typically with high argon dilution and where the detonation is characterized by very regular cells, the failure is driven by the excessive global front curvature above which a detonation cannot propagate. To discern these two failure mechanisms, porous walled tubes are used to attenuate the transverse instability before the detonation emerges into the unconfined space. Porous sections with length L/D from 0 to 3.0 are used with two confined tube diameters D\u00a0=\u00a012.7 and 15.5\u00a0mm. The present results show that when porous walled tubes are used, the critical pressure for unstable C2H2\u00a0+\u00a02.5O2 and C2H2\u00a0+\u00a05N2O mixtures increases significantly.

For L/D\u00a0>\u00a02.5 a noticeable increase in critical pressure for argon diluted mixtures is also observed. This is dominantly caused by the slow mass divergence through the porous material inducing a curvature on the detonation front even before it emerges into the open area. The present experiment again demonstrates the importance of the transverse wave instability for typical hydrocarbon mixtures in critical situations such as the critical tube diameter experiment. For special cases such as highly argon diluted mixtures, the instability does not play a significant role in the failure and the propagation is controlled dominantly by the global curvature effect and the shock-ignition mechanism.",

     "abstract": "The present paper reports the results of a study of detonation limits in rough tubes. Detonation velocity is measured by photodiodes and ionization probes spaced at 10\u00a0cm intervals along the length of the tube. Short lengths of smoked foils inserted into the core of the rough tube is used to register the structure of the detonation wave. Pressure transducers are also used to obtain the pressure profile. The results indicate that in rough tubes, the detonation velocity is generally much lower than the corresponding values for smooth tubes. The velocity decreases slowly at first and then more rapidly as the limit is approached. The velocity variation is generally continuous and at the limits, the failure velocity is of the order of about 0.4 V CJ for all cases. The detonation limits in rough tubes are found to be wider than for a smooth tube. This indicates that the turbulence generated by the wall roughness facilitates the propagation of the detonation and extends the limits. Smoked foil records show that in the core of the rough tube the detonation front has a cellular structure corresponding to the usual cellular structure due to instability of the detonation. Thus the intrinsic unstable cellular structure is quite robust and retains its global characteristics in spite of the large perturbations generated by the rough wall. The detonation in the core of the rough tube goes from multi-headed to single headed as the limit is approached. Past the single headed spin, the low velocity detonation has no cellular structure but consists of interacting weak transverse waves from the rough wall. The averaged pressure of the low velocity detonation front corresponds to about the constant volume explosion pressure, in accord with the velocity of the low velocity detonation.",

     "abstract": "The cylinder test provides a measurement of detonation product\u2019s ability to perform work on adjacent material. Historically, direct numerical simulation has been required to derive the product energy content and isentrope from experiments of cylinder expansion driven by detonation products. One-dimensional analytic methods have not been able to accurately recover these parameters when the cylinder motion is compressible, exhibiting shocks. For incompressible cylinder motion, analytic one-dimensional approximations more accurately recover the isentrope, but still only approximate the two-dimensional cylinder motion and energy. This work provides a fully two-dimensional model that recovers the exact outer cylinder shape from experimental measurements. The inner cylinder shape and product isentrope are also exactly recovered in the limit of incompressible case motion. An alternate methodology also approximates the inner case shape and isentrope for compressible case motion, effectively allowing accurate isentrope determination for any cylinder test. The isentrope derived from a PBX 9502 cylinder test with compressible motion is shown to agree well with a reference isentrope. The errors associated with the one-dimensional flow assumption are also quantified. The incompressible case model can be used to estimate case shape and velocity from a given isentrope, providing a maximum fragment velocity.",

The comparison of 2D/3D flow fields for the same injection conditions indicates that the overall flow structures are in agreement for the two simulations and that both rotating velocities are approximately 96% of the CJ value. However, Isp for the 2D RDE is approximately 10\u00a0s larger than Isp for the 3D RDE. The grid resolution study indicates that the higher grid resolution produces detonation cellular structure; however, its effects on Isp are approximately a few seconds. Although Isp in the 2D smallest scale for higher mass flow is approximately 10\u00a0s larger than that of the other large scales, Isp for low mass flow is not affected by the scale. However, 3D scale effects are important because the radius of curvature along the circumferential direction changes, which affects the propagation of the rotating detonation. Because Isp and thrust are governed by the stagnation pressure and the micro-nozzle area ratio, the mass flow rate from the injector also depends on these parameters. Isp and thrust for RDE are found to be correlated with the mass flow rate, similar to the case of a conventional rocket engine. This result indicates that the two important parameters, A\u2217/A and p0, can be replaced by one parameter, i.e., the mass flow rate.",

     "abstract": "This paper focuses on two extremes of explosions: the general class of Type Ia supernova (SNIa), which are surprisingly uniform thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars, and a specific gasoline vapor-cloud explosion that occurred at the Buncefield fuel depot in 2005. In both cases, recurring questions are whether an initial spark or small, local ignition could result in a detonation, and if so, how could this happen? The broader question is: What is the origin of the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in confined, partially confined, and unconfined systems? The importance of DDT to SNIa is based on the use of these objects as cosmological \u201cstandard candles\u201d that are used for measuring distances and curvature in the universe. The importance of DDT to Buncefield is related to design and operational safety of industrial plants and fuel storage facilities. Combinations of observations, specific laboratory experiments, and selected numerical simulations have given us information and some understanding of the DDT process and its likelihood. Numerical simulation both of large- and small-scale phenomena in these reactive flows were important ingredients in the studies. The invention and discovery of numerical algorithms, including (but not limited to) monotone methods, implicit large-eddy simulation, and adaptive mesh refinement, enabled these simulations certainly as much as the increase in computer speed and memory. Unresolved issues that arose in these studies include the nonequilibrium, non-Kolmogorov properties of the turbulence and turbulent fluctuations in these flows, how these prepare the system for transitions, and how to represent the chemical reactions and energy release in the high temperatures and pressures that are near and might signal a transition.",

     "abstract": "Combustion noise is becoming increasingly important as a major noise source in aeroengines and ground based gas turbines. This is partially because advances in design have reduced the other noise sources, and partially because next generation combustion modes burn more unsteadily, resulting in increased external noise from the combustion. This review reports recent progress made in understanding combustion noise by theoretical, numerical and experimental investigations. We first discuss the fundamentals of the sound emission from a combustion region. Then the noise of open turbulent flames is summarized. We subsequently address the effects of confinement on combustion noise. In this case not only is the sound generated by the combustion influenced by its transmission through the boundaries of the combustion chamber, there is also the possibility of a significant additional source, the so-called \u2018indirect\u2019 combustion noise. This involves hot spots (entropy fluctuations) or vorticity perturbations produced by temporal variations in combustion, which generate pressure waves (sound) as they accelerate through any restriction at the exit of the combustor. We describe the general characteristics of direct and indirect noise. To gain further insight into the physical phenomena of direct and indirect sound, we investigate a simple configuration consisting of a cylindrical or annular combustor with a low Mach number flow in which a flame zone burns unsteadily. Using a low Mach number approximation, algebraic exact solutions are developed so that the parameters controlling the generation of acoustic, entropic and vortical waves can be investigated. The validity of the low Mach number approximation is then verified by solving the linearized Euler equations numerically for a wide range of inlet Mach numbers, stagnation temperature ratios, frequency and mode number of heat release fluctuations. The effects of these parameters on the magnitude of the waves produced by the unsteady combustion are investigated. In particular the magnitude of the indirect and direct noise generated in a model combustor with a choked outlet is analyzed for a wide range of frequencies, inlet Mach numbers and stagnation temperature ratios. Finally, we summarize some of the unsolved questions that need to be the focus of future research.",

     "abstract": "Changes in engine technology, driven by the need to increase the efficiency of the SI engine and reduce NOx and soot from diesel engines, and in transport energy demand will have a profound effect on the properties, specifications and production of future fuels. The expected increase in global demand for transport energy is significantly skewed towards heavier fuels like jet fuel and diesel compared to gasoline. Abnormal combustion such as knock and preignition will become more likely as spark-ignition (SI) engines develop to become more efficient and fuel antiknock quality will become more important. In current and future SI engines, for a given RON (research octane number), a fuel of lower MON (motor octane number) has better antiknock quality. Current fuel specifications in several parts of the world assume that MON contributes to antiknock quality and will need to be revised as the mismatch with engine requirements widens. Diesel engines need to maintain efficiency while reducing emissions of soot and NOx. Soot and NOx can be controlled more easily if such engines are run on fuels of extremely low cetane. In the long term compression ignition engines could run on fuels which require less processing in the refinery compared to today\u2019s fuels. Such an engine/fuel system could be significantly cheaper and also help mitigate the expected demand imbalance in favour of heavier fuels.

     "abstract": "Internal combustion engines running on liquid fuels will remain the dominant prime movers for road and air transportation for decades, probably for most of this century. The world\u2019s appetite for liquid transportation fuels derived from petroleum and other fossil resources is already immense, will grow, will at some future time become economically unsustainable, and will become infeasible only in the very long term. The ongoing process of augmenting and eventually replacing petroleum-derived fuels with liquid alternative fuels must necessarily involve approaches that result in comparatively much lower net carbon cycle emissions from the transportation sector, most likely through a combination of carbon sequestration and renewable fuel production. The successful growth and establishment of a sustainable, profitable alternative fuels industry will be best facilitated by approaches that integrate alternative products into petroleum-derived fuel streams (i.e., gasolines, diesel, and jet fuels) and consider synergistic evolution of and integration with prevailing refining and liquid fuel distribution infrastructures.The emergence of low temperature combustion strategies, particularly those implementing dual fuel methods to achieve Reaction Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI), offers the potential to significantly improve operating efficiency and reduce emissions with minimal aftertreatment. For all advanced combustion engine technologies, but especially for RCCI, a clear understanding of fuel property influences on combustion behaviors will be important to achieving projected engine performance and emissions.To achieve the benefits projected by emerging engine technologies, the properties of petroleum-derived fuels themselves must be modified over time, but the effects of blending candidate alternative fuels with these conventional fuels must also be understood. Predicting the coupled physical and chemical property effects of real fuels on energy conversion system performance and emissions is a daunting problem, even for petroleum-derived real fuels, since each is composed of several hundred to thousands of individual chemical species typically belonging to one of a few organic classes (e.g., n-paraffins, iso-paraffins, cyclo-paraffins, olefins, aromatics). For specific combustion applications, it is often the global combustion response to variations in the composition of fuel mixtures \u2013 inclusive of those occurring by blending petroleum-derived fuel with alternative fuel candidates \u2013 that is of interest for fuel property optimization. This paper presents an overview of tools used for evaluating and emulating combustion-relevant properties of real fuels and alternative fuel candidates. New analytical and statistical methods can provide important insights as to how the ensembles of distinct molecular structures found in a given fuel mixture contribute to the physical and chemical kinetic properties that govern its combustion in energy conversion processes. Such tools can in turn assist in screening candidate alternative fuels for more detailed study.",

Ab initio calculations were used to obtain rate coefficients for reactions of HOCHO with H, O, and HO2. Modeling predictions with the mechanism have been compared to the experimental results of de Wilde and van Tiggelen (1968) who measured the laminar burning velocities for HOCHO flames over a range of stoichiometries and dilution ratios. The modeling predictions are generally satisfactory. The governing reaction mechanisms are outlined based on calculations with the kinetic model. Formic acid is consumed mainly by reaction with OH, yielding OCHO, which dissociates rapidly to CO2\u00a0+\u00a0H, and HOCO, which may dissociate to CO\u00a0+\u00a0OH or CO2\u00a0+\u00a0H, or react with H, OH, or O2 to form more stable products.

To utilize this promising fuel, more and more knowledge on the chemical kinetics of DEE oxidation will be required. For the present article, the rate constants of unimolecular reactions of ethoxyethylperoxy radicals, which are main intermediates in the oxidation of DEE under the engine relevant conditions, have been computationally investigated and compared with those of alkanes. Geometries, vibrational frequencies, and energies of reactants, products, and transition states with pronounced barrier were calculated according to the procedure of the CBS-QB3 method. The high-pressure limiting rate constants were calculated in the temperature range of 500\u22122000\u00a0K by using a conventional transition state theory with hindered rotor approximation for low frequency torsional mode. The oxygen dissociation reactions have been investigated by using a variational transition state theory based on the CASPT2(7,5)/aug-cc-pvdz single point calculations at UB3LYP/CBSB7 geometries and vibrational frequencies. It was found that the oxidation pathways are equal to those of alkane oxidations, however, the rate constants are significantly different from those of alkanes due to the oxygen vicinity. The rate constants of intramolecular hydrogen shift reactions are from 3 to 8 times larger at 700\u00a0K than those of alkylic peroxy radical when the abstracted hydrogen is in the \u03b2-position of the ether. The rate constant of \u03b2-scission reactions for 1,5-intramolecular hydrogen shift products of 1-ethoxyethylperoxy radial is 163 times larger at 700\u00a0K than that of alkylic hydroperoxy radical, and this reaction becomes a main reaction pathway, whereas cyclic-ether is a main product in alkane oxidation. These characteristic rate constants are given in three-parameter modified Arrhenius form for the refinement of predictive chemical kinetic models being developed.",

Using these measurements and the site-specific H-abstraction measurements of Sivaramakrishnan and Michael (2009) [1,2], general expressions for three secondary and two tertiary abstraction rates were determined as follows (the subscripts indicate the number of carbon atoms bonded to the next-nearest-neighbor carbon):S 20 = 1.58 \u00d7 10 - 11 exp ( - 1550 K / T ) cm 3 molecule - 1 s - 1 ( 887 \u2013 1327 K ) S 30 = 2.37 \u00d7 10 - 11 exp ( - 1850 K / T ) cm 3 molecule - 1 s - 1 ( 887 \u2013 1327 K ) S 21 = 4.5 \u00d7 10 - 12 exp ( - 793.7 K / T ) cm 3 molecule - 1 s - 1 ( 833 \u2013 1440 K ) T 100 = 2.85 \u00d7 10 - 11 exp ( - 1138.3 K / T ) cm 3 molecule - 1 s - 1 ( 878 \u2013 1375 K ) T 101 = 7.16 \u00d7 10 - 12 exp ( - 993 K / T ) cm 3 molecule - 1 s - 1 ( 883 \u2013 1362 K )",

The PESs are then used to calculate Lennard-Jones collision parameters, and a general rule for calculating these parameters based only on the number of carbon atoms and the bath gas is obtained. Next, the PESs are used to calculate low-order moments of the collisional energy transfer function relevant to low-pressure-limit unimolecular kinetics for a total of 266 systems (38 unimolecular reactants in 7 baths), with a focus on the average angular momentum and total energy transferred in deactivating collisions. These moments are used to quantify the relative rotational and total collision efficiencies of the 7 baths for the various hydrocarbon reactants.

     "abstract": "An essentially universal assumption of chemical kinetics is that bimolecular reactions only occur between reactants of rovibrational energy described by a Boltzmann (thermal) distribution. Given that the O2 mole fraction is roughly 20% under nearly all relevant low-temperature combustion situations, there is significant potential for molecules to undergo reactive collisions with O2 on the same time scale as the energy-transferring collisions necessary to achieving a Boltzmann distribution. Within the context of low-temperature combustion, this phenomenon conceivably gives rise to an entirely non-Boltzmann sequence involving multiple reactions of fuel-derived radicals with O2 to produce multiple OH radicals. Given the complex interplay among simultaneous internal isomerizations, energy-transferring collisions, dissociations and reactive collisions across multiple reaction surfaces, estimating the extent of deviations from conventional thermal assumptions is not straightforward. A novel methodology is presented for coupling multiple master equations and deriving effective phenomenological rate constants for thermal sets of reactants to thermal sets of products in chemically activated sequences that proceed across multiple reaction surfaces. The methodology is used to establish a better understanding of the nature of non-Boltzmann reactant distribution effects and quantify their magnitude. As a case study, we implement the methodology to explore the effect of non-Boltzmann reactants on product branching fractions of the QOOH*\u00a0+\u00a0O2 reaction from n-propyl oxidation as well as its associated dependence with O2 mole fraction, temperature, and pressure. While it appears that the effect of non-Boltzmann reaction sequences will be considerably smaller at higher pressures (at least for propane), it appears that consideration of non-Boltzmann reaction sequences is likely required for interpretations of experimental measurements commonly used to investigate the R\u00a0+\u00a0O2 and QOOH\u00a0+\u00a0O2 reactions central to engine-relevant ignition behavior. With regard to observable signatures of these effects in experiments, the presence of a stronger-than-usual O2 mole fraction dependence may be a likely indicator of non-Boltzmann behavior.",

     "abstract": "A number of reactions on the C3H6 potential energy surface (PES) are of central importance to various combustion environments. High level theoretical methods were used to predict the temperature and pressure dependent kinetics for these reactions. The rovibrational properties of the key stationary points in the systems were determined with the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ method. High accuracy energies for these stationary points were obtained via the consideration of basis set, higher-order correlation, core\u2013valence, anharmonic vibrational, relativistic, and diagonal Born\u2013Oppenheimer corrections. Variable reaction coordinate transition state theory (VRC-TST) was employed to treat the barrierless channels on the PES, while, for channels possessing a distinct barrier, rate coefficients were instead obtained with conventional transition state theory employing rigid-rotor harmonic oscillator assumptions. For the VRC-TST calculations, the interaction energies required for the evaluation of the reactive flux were evaluated with the CASPT2/cc-pVTZ approach for the orientational sampling, coupled with one-dimensional corrections based on higher accuracy evaluations along the minimum energy path. A priori predictions for the temperature and pressure-dependent rate coefficients were obtained through master-equation calculations incorporating these TST predictions for the microcanonical rate coefficients coupled with a simple model for the collisional energy transfer rates. These theoretical predictions compare favorably with the limited experimental data. The analysis yields modified Arrhenius rate expressions for the 1CH2\u00a0+\u00a0C2H4, C2H3\u00a0+\u00a0CH3, CH2CHCH2\u00a0+\u00a0H, CH3CCH2\u00a0+\u00a0H, and CH3CHCH\u00a0+\u00a0H recombination reactions as well as for the dissociations and isomerizations of propene and cyclopropane.",

Time-history measurements of fuel, OH, aldehydes (mostly CH2O), CO2, H2O, and temperature were also measured under these conditions. These time-histories provide critically needed kinetic targets to test and refine large reaction mechanisms. Measurements were acquired using a novel constrained reaction volume approach, wherein a sliding gate valve confined the reactant mixture to a region near the endwall of the shock tube. A staged-driver gas filling strategy, combined with driver section extensions, driver inserts, and driver gas tailoring, was used to obtain constant-pressure test times of up to 55\u00a0ms, allowing observations of the chemistry in the Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) region. Experiments with conventional shock tube filling were also performed, showing similar overall ignition behavior. Comparisons between current data and simulations using the Mehl et al. n-Heptane mechanism (2011) are provided, revealing that the mechanism generally under-predicts first-stage ignition delay times in the NTC region, and that at low temperatures it over-predicts the extent of fuel decomposition during first stage ignition.",

Between 2.5 and 5.5\u00a0bar, the RCM results show that ignition delay times of DEE exhibit a region (between 590 and 800\u00a0K) where ignition delay times are weakly temperature dependent only, while above 833\u00a0K and below 590\u00a0K, the ignition delay times are strongly temperature dependent.

It is shown that this process is characterized by two time scales, the fastest of which relates to the generation of the required for ignition radical pool and the temperature increase. This time scale associates mainly to carbon chemistry, except the very last period of its presence where it relates to hydrogen/oxygen-chemistry. The analysis allows for the quantitative assessment of several chemical phenomena that have been associated with the abnormal long ignition delay of methane, such as the formation of C2H6 and the relative importance of the formation of CH2O and CH3O as means of consumption of CH3 radicals.

The possibility of a direct decomposition of the OQ\u2032OOH from its initially produced energy distribution is studied with a combination of master equation (ME) and direct trajectory simulations. The temperature and pressure dependent rate constants for the thermal decomposition of a ketohydroperoxide, HOOCH2CH2CHO, to four product channels were computed using RRKM/ME methods. Direct dynamics calculations were initiated from a transition state in the O2\u00a0+\u00a0QOOH reaction network to understand the fraction of energy in that transition state that is converted into the internal energy of the OQ\u2032OOH. A novel approach to solving the master equation is used to determine the probability that a vibrationally hot OQ\u2032OOH either will be stabilized to a thermal distribution or will react to form new products. Under most conditions, the majority of vibrationally excited OQ\u2032OOH will be quenched into a thermal distribution. At higher internal energies and lower pressures, however, a significant fraction of the hot OQ\u2032OOH will decompose rather than thermalize.

     "abstract": "High pressure, single pulse shock tube oxidation experiments were conducted in order to probe the chemical kinetic effects of the double bond position in long alkenes. All oxidation experiments were carried out with approximately 100\u00a0ppm of 1-decene, cis-2-decene, cis-5-decene, and trans-5-decene, in argon, at stoichiometric conditions. The experimental conditions covered the pressure range of 40\u201366\u00a0bar and temperature range of 850\u20131500\u00a0K, with an average reaction time of 2\u00a0ms. Gas chromatographic measurements of the stable intermediates indicated increased reactivity for the isomers with more centrally located double bonds, with no influence from the cis\u2013trans configuration observed at these conditions. Significantly different yields in most of the intermediate species measured were observed. Chemical kinetic models were assembled with the aid of Reaction Mechanism Generator where these are able to adequately predict the major product species of all isomers investigated. Simulation of the experiments indicates significantly different reaction pathways that each decene isomers undergoes, controlled entirely by the position of the double bond. The implication for fuels with such molecular structure is that reactivity, as well as pollutant formation characteristics can be significantly different depending on the position of the double bond in very similar molecules.",

     "abstract": "Aromatic species represent a significant fraction (about one third by weight) of both diesel and gasoline fuels. Much of the aromatics in diesel and gasoline are alkyl-benzene species. Although toluene, the lightest of the alkyl-benzenes, has been the subject of extensive literature investigations, very little experimental data are available for heavier alkyl-benzenes (9\u201320 carbon atoms) relevant to diesel fuel.In this work, the burning velocity of ethyl-, n-propyl- and n-butyl-benzenes were measured in a premixed flat-flame burner using the heat flux method. The burning velocities were measured as a function of the equivalence ratio at atmospheric pressure and for two unburned gas temperatures (358 and 398\u00a0K). These new experiments are compared with burning velocities for toluene previously measured by the authors. The comparisons showed that ethyl-benzene has the highest flame speed, followed by n-propyl- and n-butyl-benzenes which have similar burning velocities. Toluene has the lowest flame speed. Excellent agreement was observed between the new measurements and simulations using a mechanism for alkyl-benzenes recently published by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and National University of Ireland.Based on the strong correlation between experiments and calculations, different aspects contributing to the burning speed of the fuels (thermal effects, kinetics, \u2026) were analyzed using the model. A sensitivity analysis was used to determine the reaction rate constants that are most important in determining the flame speed. Reaction path analysis and species profiles in the flame were used to identify the key reaction paths that lead to increase or decrease in the burning velocities. Contrary to what is generally observed for alkanes whose flame speed is controlled by small radical fragments, the flame speed of aromatics is influenced by fuel specific intermediates such as phenyl, benzyl, or even heavier species. The new experimental data and modeling insight generated by this work will support the development of models for heavier alkyl-aromatics of great relevance to diesel fuel.",

     "abstract": "This paper describes the first development of detailed kinetic models for the alkylbenzenes actually present in diesel fuels. Thanks to a new version of the software EXGAS dedicated to alkylbenzenes, the first detailed models for the oxidation of alkylbenzenes with an alkyl chain containing more than 2 atoms of carbon have been automatically generated. These models are based on an aromatic reaction base consisting of a recent ethylbenzene detailed kinetic model. They involve a new type of generic primary reaction for EXGAS mechanisms, ipso-addition, and new generic rules for the estimation of kinetic parameters involved in primary and secondary mechanisms. The existing experimental data on the oxidation of n-propylbenzene and n-butylbenzene, as well as new results on the oxidation of n-hexylbenzene obtained in a jet-stirred reactor from 500 to 1100\u00a0K under 1\u00a0atm, have been successfully modeled. Simulations well reproduce the more important low-temperature reactivity which is observed for n-hexylbenzene compared to n-butylbenzene. This new tool has also been used to numerically investigate the behavior of alkylbenzenes from n-propylbenzene up to n-decylbenzene. Simulations using this model show an important enhancement of low-temperature reactivity when the alkyl chain in the compounds increases. Flow rate analyses show that this significant increase is due to a decreasing influence of resonance stabilized benzylic radicals obtained from the reactant by H-abstractions on the carbon atom neighboring the ring.",

We find that the diagnostics offer many insights into how individual observations influence parameter estimates, such as which observations determine which parameters to what extent. Additionally, the significance of non-linearities in the model responses is investigated. While we observe that they can be of substantial importance to the derivatives of the best parameter estimates with respect to the experimental data, and improve the numerical conditioning of the involved matrix inversion, we find that results obtained from the linear omission-based diagnostics frequently agree, at least qualitatively, with those obtained from the derivatives.",

The pyrolysis species were analyzed by two methods, synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. Dozens of species were identified and quantified, including lots of isomers. The emphasis of this study is to investigate the primary decomposition of ECH, including its initial decomposition, isomerization, and further reactions of the cyclic C8H15 radicals formed from the H-abstraction of ECH. The observation of C8H16 alkene indicates the existence of ring-opening isomerization reaction of ECH. The ring-opening isomerization reaction of cyclic C8H15 radicals produces alkenyl radicals, whose further decomposition constitutes the various chain and branched intermediates in ECH pyrolysis. The formation of isoprene and vinylcyclopentane is discussed, which highlights isomerization reactions of radical addition on the double bond of alkenyl radicals, such as oct-6-en-1-yl and oct-5-en-1-yl radicals. The theoretical calculation on the reaction pathways of oct-5-en-1-yl radical also shows that its internal H-migration pathway via eight-membered ring might be competitive to the one via five-membered ring. On the other hand, the decomposition of cyclic C8H15 radicals causes the formation of cyclic intermediates, i.e. C8H14 alkenes, methylenecyclohexane and cyclohexene, which are potential aromatic precursors.",

The time- and isomer-resolved formation of products is probed with multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS) using tunable vacuum ultraviolet ionizing synchrotron radiation. The peroxy radical chemistry of the unsaturated alcohols appears much less rich than that of saturated C4 and C5 alcohols. The main products observed are the corresponding unsaturated aldehydes \u2013 prenal (3-methyl-2-butenal) from prenol oxidation and isoprenal (3-methyl-3-butenal) from isoprenol oxidation. No significant products arising from QOOH chemistry are observed. These results can be qualitatively explained by the formation of resonance stabilized allylic radicals via H-abstraction in the Cl\u00a0+\u00a0prenol and Cl\u00a0+\u00a0isoprenol initiation reactions. The loss of resonance stabilization upon O2 addition causes the energies of the intermediate wells, saddle points, and products to increase relative to the energy of the initial radicals and O2. These energetic shifts make most product channels observed in the peroxy radical chemistry of saturated alcohols inaccessible for these unsaturated alcohols. The experimental findings are underpinned by quantum-chemical calculations for stationary points on the potential energy surfaces for the reactions of the initial radicals with O2. Under our conditions, the dominant channels in prenol and isoprenol oxidation are the chain-terminating HO2-forming channels arising from radicals, in which the unpaired electron and the \u2013OH group are on the same carbon atom, with stable prenal and isoprenal co-products, respectively. These findings suggest that the presence of CC double bonds in alcohols will reduce low-temperature reactivity during autoignition.",

Among them, smaller, oxygenated compounds, are of particular importance, both as neat fuels and as potential blending agents in engines operating on practical fuels. Additionally, oxygenated exhaust species, e.g. small aldehydes, are harmful and are expected to be regulated by future emission standards. The assessment of the effect of specific fuel components on overall engine efficiency and performance, as well as on pollutants formation, needs to be tackled through a detailed kinetics approach that inherently allows such a correlation. In the present work, a single, in-house developed, detailed chemical kinetic mechanism is utilized in order to model and analyze five stoichiometric or near stoichiometric low-pressure laminar premixed flames of C1\u2013C2 oxygenated fuels; flames of the two smallest aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) and the two smallest alcohols (methanol and ethanol) are considered. The mechanism is shown to satisfactorily reproduce fuel decay as well as major and intermediate species profiles. Reaction path analysis is extensively utilized in order to scrutinize the controlling elementary steps. Parts of the mechanism are identified for further model improvement, based on critical evaluation of available specific rate constants. Early branching ratios and reactions between the major carbonyl or alkoxy products with oxygen carriers, and in particular reactions with O2, appear to be pivotal for the overall oxidation process.",

     "abstract": "Although the reactions of fuel-radicals with other dominant flame radicals such as H and CH3 are important reactions in low-pressure flames, they have not been well studied. These reactions may occur through either recombination to form stabilized molecular complexes or direct abstractions and chemically activated addition\u2013eliminations to yield bimolecular products. Here, the role of such reactions in low-pressure flames of ethanol and methylformate is studied through a combination of theoretical characterizations of key reactions and detailed kinetic modeling. In particular, H and CH3\u00a0+\u00a0fuel-radical reactions have been characterized theoretically in this work and these are shown to make a pronounced impact on the formation of intermediates. Theoretical calculations for H\u00a0+\u00a0CH3CHOH and CH3\u00a0+\u00a0CH3CHOH predict that at low pressures recombinations are minor processes with well-skipping (addition\u2013eliminations) dominating the reaction flux. Direct abstraction was also considered in H\u00a0+\u00a0CH3CHOH and theory suggests that abstraction at the CH3-site forming CH2CHOH is the only important channel. Notably, this result is counter to analogy based predictions that CH3CHO should be the dominant abstraction product. Low-pressure ethanol flame simulations indicate that addition\u2013elimination reactions from H\u00a0+\u00a0CH3CHOH and CH3\u00a0+\u00a0CH3CHOH are a major source for C2H4 and C3H6 profiles, respectively.

DME and other important intermediate species such as CH2O and CO are also measured by MBMS between 400 and 1150\u00a0K at different fuel concentrations. Species profiles in the reactor were calculated by using both zero- and two-dimensional computations with different detailed kinetics for cross-validation and comparison with experimental results. The models predict adequately the low and intermediate oxidation temperature windows near 600 and 1000\u00a0K, respectively. However, both models over-predicted the DME consumption as well as CO, HO2 and H2O2 formations at the low temperature oxidation window by more than a factor of four. Moreover, although the model predicted reasonably well the formation of CH2O and CO/CO2 at the intermediate temperature oxidation window, the concentration of H2O2 was also over-predicted, suggesting the large uncertainties existing in the DME low temperature chemistry and in H2O2 chemistry at intermediate temperature. Furthermore, to analyze the uncertainty of the low temperature chemistry, a branching ratio of QOOH decomposition to CH2O was derived using measured DME, CH2O and CO concentrations. The large difference between the modeled and measured branching ratios of QOOH decomposition suggests an underestimated QOOH decomposition rate to form CH2O in the current DME models.",

As an exemplary case, we employed the mechanism from Marinov (1999) and found a very good agreement between the experimental and simulation results. We also calculated rate coefficients for the most important decomposition steps of ethanol from statistical rate theory by solving a thermal multichannel master equation. Reaction (R1) as well as the bond fission channels C2H5OH\u00a0\u2192\u00a0CH3\u00a0+\u00a0CH2OH (R2) and C2H5OH\u00a0\u2192\u00a0C2H5\u00a0+\u00a0OH (R3) were considered. The specific rate coefficients were obtained from RRKM theory (R1) and the Statistical Adiabatic Channel Model (R2 and R3) with molecular and transition state data from quantum chemical calculations at CCSD(T)-F12/def2-QZVPP//MP2/cc-pVQZ level of theory. The rate coefficient obtained from the ab initio data were slightly fitted to recently published experimental values of k1, k2, and k3 and inserted into Marinov\u2019s mechanism. A similar good representation of the concentration\u2013time profiles as with the original mechanism was obtained.",

OH radicals were produced by rapid thermal decomposition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), and OH time-histories were monitored by narrow-linewidth UV laser absorption of the well-characterized R1(5) line in the OH A-X (0, 0) band near 306.69\u00a0nm.

Rate constants such as H-abstraction of MA by O, H, OH, CH3, and HO2 radicals as well as MA radical decomposition were computed by high-level ab initio and RRKM master equation calculations. A new methyl acetate kinetic model was developed and compared to the experimental data along with other existing models. Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations were conducted and the results were used to validate the zero-dimensional prediction in a flow reactor. The MA pyrolysis results in the flow-reactor experiments showed that MA decomposition to CH3\u00a0+\u00a0CH3\u00a0+\u00a0CO2 and CH3OH\u00a0+\u00a0CH2CO are the dominant pathways, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction of the new model. In addition, a two-stage MA oxidation was observed between 800\u00a0K and 1050\u00a0K, suggesting the possible existence of low-temperature chemistry for MA oxidation. The low-pressure flame experiment at a rich condition suggested that MA has unique reaction pathways to form aldehydes, ketones, and acids. Comparison with previous kinetic models showed that the present model considerably improved the predictability of species-temperature histories in the flow reactor and successfully identifies the main reaction pathway of ketene and acetic acid in a low pressure flame for the first time.",

The flames were stabilized on a perforated plate burner at 1\u00a0atm using the heat flux method at conditions where the net heat loss from the flame to the burner is zero.

Experimental results were compared with predictions of several kinetic models from the literature. Recent model of Leplat et al.

The effects of initial temperature on the adiabatic laminar burning velocities of acetaldehyde were interpreted using the correlation SL\u00a0=\u00a0SL0 (T/T0)\u03b1. Particular attention was paid to the variation of the power exponent \u03b1 with equivalence ratio. The existence of a minimum in \u03b1 in the slightly rich mixtures is demonstrated experimentally and confirmed computationally.

Comprehensive 2D MS analysis of the effluent revealed that the main products observed at temperatures below 1000\u00a0K are CO, CO2, C4-olefins and 4-pentenoic acid. Initially, GVL is consumed predominantly through isomerization to 4-pentenoic acid, although minor contributions of bimolecular decomposition channels cannot be ruled out. CBS-QB3 level characterization of the C5H8O2 potential energy surface reveals the existence of a low energy barrier for ring-opening to 4-pentenoic acid. The weak CC bond between C2 and C3 in 4-pentenoic acid allows formation of radicals that further convert gamma-valerolactone or 4-pentenoic acid. The 4-pentenoic acid yield increases steadily with rising temperature before a sharp decrease around 1010\u00a0K. The latter can be explained by radical chemistry taking over at high temperatures.",

     "abstract": "Furans have recently raised as possible transportation fuels which can be produced from biological sources and biotechnological methods. Their role on combustion-generated particle formation results quite unexplored. Few studies showed that dimethylfuran (DMF) among the other furanic hydrocarbons seems to have a great tendency to form soot precursors. This unexpected trend should be kept in mind before a further usage of furans, especially DMF, as transportation fuels.The effect of furans as substituent to traditional fuels has been investigated both experimentally and numerically in a counter-flow diffusion flame. Furan, 2-methylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran have been chosen as standards for furanic fuels. Optical techniques, previously validated, namely laser induced fluorescence and incandescence, have been adopted to detect small nanoparticles and soot aggregates, respectively. On the modeling part, a sectional approach has been used to confirm the sooting tendency experimentally found for the investigated fuels. A gas phase kinetic mechanism available in literature for oxidation and decomposition of furans has been integrated in a recently developed detailed kinetic mechanism for particulate formation.Experiments confirmed by model show that furanic fuels increase particle production. Furan has the lowest impact on the particle production whereas 2,5-dimethylfuran and 2-methylfuran show a higher propensity; in particular, 2-methylfuran has a greater tendency to produce particles with respect to 2,5-dimethylfuran.Modeling analysis showed that 2-methylfuran produces large amounts of C4-species and thus benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 2,5-dimethylfuran mainly forms phenol during its decomposition, which leads to cyclopentadiene and thus naphthalene formation. However, in the operating conditions analyzed in this study the overall PAHs and first particle production result less strong than in 2-methylfuran. However, different combustion conditions can change the effectiveness of these channels and might invert the particle production tendency of furanic fuels.",

     "abstract": "The unimolecular decomposition of tetrahydrofuran (THF), a building block of possible second-generation biofuels, was studied at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. As its initial initiation routes remain unknown, a large number of pathways were explored involving three types of fundamental elementary mechanisms: diradical, carbenic and pericyclic. Based on the computed potential energy surfaces, thermochemical data and pressure dependant rate parameters were determined and included in a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for THF pyrolysis. Simulations were performed and compared to pyrolysis products of the literature, measured behind reflected shock waves. The kinetic analyses showed that THF unimolecular decomposition is initiated by reactions involving diradicals and carbenes. A pericyclic rearrangement was also shown to be crucial in its thermal decomposition. Acyclic isomers of THF are major products of its unimolecular initiation and are predominantly formed from diradical intermediates isomerization and from the pericyclic reaction. The major pathway in the decomposition of carbenes ultimately yields two molecular products (CH2O and propene). Initial CC and CO bond fissions in the acyclic THF isomers lead to the formation of the initial radicals (ranked by importance): ethyl\u00a0\u2248\u00a0vinyloxy (CH2CHO)\u00a0>\u00a0allyl\u00a0>\u00a0methoxy\u00a0\u2248\u00a0hydroxymethyl.

     "abstract": "Cymenes are monoterpene derivatives composed of a benzene ring with iso-propyl and methyl substituents, and the proximity of the two alkyl groups enables relevant analysis into the ortho-effect of polysubstituted aromatics, in which low-temperature autoignition is more facile for ortho-substitution. The initial steps of ROO-related reactions from Cl-initiated oxidation of ortho-, meta- and para-cymene were studied at low pressure (8\u00a0Torr) over the temperature range 450\u2013750\u00a0K using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS). Ratios of cyclic ether formation (related to chain-propagation and OH formation) relative to HO2-loss (related to chain-termination) were measured to characterize the ortho-effect as a function of temperature. The main results are twofold:(i) Cyclic ether measurements indicate significant chain-propagation below 700\u00a0K only in o-cymene oxidation; above 700\u00a0K, chain-propagation of the three cymene isomers converge. (ii) The competition between chain-propagation channels stemming from resonance- and non-resonance-stabilized initial cymene radicals changes significantly with temperature, with chain-propagation near 700\u00a0K arising predominantly from non-resonance-stabilized R radicals.Cyclic ether yields in m- and p-cymene oxidation are negligible below 650\u00a0K, indicating minimal chain-propagation. In contrast, o-cymene exhibits significant cyclic ether formation, attributed to the favorable 6- and 7-membered-ring transition states in the formation of hydroperoxyalkyl (QOOH) intermediates from peroxy radicals (ROO). The cyclic ether/HO2-loss ratio in o-cymene oxidation is defined as unity at 450\u00a0K and decreases to \u223c0.10 at 700\u00a0K. The ratio converges to \u223c0.10 at 700\u00a0K for the three cymene isomers, indicating an upper limit of temperature for the ortho-effect. Photoionization spectra of cyclic ether formation from o-cymene oxidation indicate a competition between both resonance- and non-resonance-stabilized initial radicals at the lower range of temperature. With increasing temperature, cyclic ether formation shifts from pathways involving resonance-stabilized initial radicals towards pathways solely from non-resonance-stabilized initial radicals because of back-dissociation of weakly bound ROO adducts.",

The fuel\u2013air equivalence ratio of the reactants was varied from very oxidizing to strongly reducing conditions. The results supplement high-pressure data from RCM (900\u20131100\u00a0K) and shock tubes (900\u20132200\u00a0K).

The predicted H2 oxidation rate was sensitive to the rate of the HO2\u00a0+\u00a0OH reaction, particularly at lean conditions, and the present data support recent values for the rate constant.

     "abstract": "Final burnout of char particles from practical fuels such as coal and biomass occurs in the presence of a large ash component. Also, newly utilized coal resources, such as those from India, often contain much larger ash fractions than have traditionally been utilized. In the past, the inhibitory influence of ash on pulverized coal particle combustion has been most frequently modeled using an ash film model, though such films are rarely found when examining partially combusted particles. Conversely, some measurements have suggested that mineral components exposed on the surface of burning pulverized coal (pc) particles may diffuse back into the char matrix, the effect of which can be modeled as an ash dilution effect. To explore the implications of these different ash inhibition models on the temporal evolution of char combustion during burnout, we have developed a new computational model that considers the possibility of an ash film effect, an ash dilution effect, or some arbitrary combination of the two effects acting in tandem, which is the most realistic scenario. This new model predicts that restricted diffusion through the ash film has a significant impact on the char burnout rate throughout its lifetime, whereas char dilution only inhibits combustion significantly when most of the char has been consumed and the combustion mode shifts from predominantly external diffusion control to mixed diffusion control, with sensitivity to both external and internal diffusion resistance. The comparison of the model predictions with experimental results also confirms the previously suggested need to include gasification reaction steps when modeling coal char combustion.",

A primary reference fuel (PRF) blend of n-heptane/iso-octane, and a toluene reference fuel (TRF) blend of n-heptane/iso-octane/toluene are used where the aromatic fraction of the latter is set to 20% (liquid volume), while the content of n-heptane is adjusted so that the overall reactivity of the undoped fuels is similar, e.g., Anti-Knock Index (AKI) of \u223c91, Cetane Number (CN) \u223c25. Doping levels of 0.1, 1.0 and 3.0% (liquid volume basis) are used where tests are conducted within a rapid compression machine (RCM) at a compressed pressure of 21\u00a0bar, covering temperatures from 675 to 1025\u00a0K with stoichiometric fuel\u2013oxygen ratios at O2\u00a0=\u00a011.4%.At the experimental conditions, it is found that the doping effectiveness of 2EHN is fairly similar between the two fuels, though 2EHN is more effective in the aromatic blend at the lowest temperatures, while it is slightly more effective in the non-aromatic blend at intermediate temperatures. Kinetic modeling of the experiments indicates that although some of the reactivity trends can be captured using a detailed model, the extents of predicted Cetane Number enhancement by 2EHN are too large, while differences in fuel interactions for the two fuels result in excessive stimulation of the non-aromatic blend. Sensitivity analysis using the kinetic model indicates that the CH2O and CH3O2 chemistry are very sensitive to the dopant at all conditions. The rate of 2EHN decomposition is only important at low temperatures where its decomposition rate is slow due to the high activation energy of the reaction. At higher temperatures, dopant-derived 3-heptyl radicals are predicted to play an important role stimulating ignition. Finally, nitrogen chemistry is important through the \u2019NO \u2013 NO2 loop\u2019 where this can generate substantial amounts of OH. However, at the highest doping levels the formation of methyl and ethyl nitrite, and nitric acid significantly competes with this so that less OH is generated and this constrains the reactivity enhancement of 2EHN.",

Moreover, the new method is up to three orders of magnitude faster than traditional implementations of the ODE solver where the Jacobian information is generated automatically via finite differences, and the factorization relies on standard, dense matrix operations. Unlike mechanism reduction strategies, the adaptive preconditioners do not alter the underlying system of differential equations.

     "abstract": "A global sampling approach based on low discrepancy sequences has been applied in order to propose error bars on simulations performed using a detailed kinetic model for the oxidation of n-butane (including 1111 reactions). A two parameter uncertainty factor has been assigned to each considered rate constant. The cases of ignition and oxidation in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) have both been considered. For the JSR, not only the reactant mole fraction has been considered, but also that of some representative products. A temperature range from 500 to 1250\u00a0K has been studied, including the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region where the predictive error bars have been found to be the largest. It is this temperature region where the highest number of reactions play a role in contributing to the overall output errors. A global sensitivity approach based on high dimensional model representations (HDMR) has then been applied in order to identify those reactions which make the largest contributions to the overall uncertainty of the simulated results. The HDMR analysis has been restricted to the most important reactions based on a non-linear screening method, using Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficients at all studied temperatures. The final global sensitivity analysis for predicted ignition delays illustrates that the key reactions are mainly included in the primary mechanism, for temperatures from 700 to 900\u00a0K, and in the C0C2 reaction base at higher temperatures. Interestingly, for predicted butane mole fractions in the JSR, the key reactions are almost exclusively from the reaction base, whatever the temperature. The individual contribution of some key reactions is also discussed.",

The meso-scale outwardly propagating spherical laminar flames, in a flame radius rf range of approximately from 1 to 5\u00a0mm, were observed by using sequential schlieren images recorded under appropriate ignition condition. The mixtures at each equivalence ratio (\u03d5\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u20131.0) were diluted with Ar, CO2 or N2 to set different laminar burning velocities (SL0\u00a0=\u00a015\u201390\u00a0cm/s) at so-called unstretched flames, because \u03c4c can vary depending on SL0. The radius rf and the burning velocity SLl of micro-scale flames were estimated from obtained images. Macro-scale laminar flames with rf >7\u00a0mm were also examined for comparison. It was found that the burning velocities of meso-scale flames for the mixtures diluted with CO2 at \u03d5\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u20131.0 have a tendency to decrease with increasing rf, and approach those of macro-scale flames, whereas such a trend cannot be seen for the mixtures diluted with Ar as well as N2 at \u03d5\u00a0=\u00a00.7\u20131.0. This shows flame size and Karlovitz number to have optimum values to improve burning velocity.

Experiments are conducted using the heat flux method at initial temperature of 298\u00a0K.

A new facility was designed for such high pressure burner stabilized flame experiments. The results obtained are compared with five chemical kinetic schemes from literature for syngas mixtures at elevated pressures. Large differences are observed between the kinetic schemes and the experiments which can be attributed to certain key chemical reactions.

Direct numerical simulations of time evolution of expanding spherical flames from a small ignition kernel to a propagating front with sufficiently large radius provide the relations between stretched flame speed and stretch rate that can be used to assess the uncertainty of extrapolation models. It is found that the uncertainties of flame extrapolation largely depend on the mixture Lewis numbers. While the uncertainty is minimized for stoichiometric H2/air and n-heptane/air flames, the uncertainty can be as high as 60% for lean H2/air mixtures, and 10% for lean and rich n-heptane/air mixtures. The present findings show that the weakly stretched flame assumption fails for lean hydrogen mixtures, and give a good explanation to the discrepancies between experiments and model predictions for H2/air as well as the discrepancies between measurements of n-heptane/air using spherical and counterflow flames.

Flame speeds of outwardly propagating spherical flames were measured in a high-pressure, cylindrical flame speed vessel using schlieren photography. It was ensured that the measured data were outside the ignition- and chamber-confinement-affected radii. The unstretched, unburnt flame speeds were obtained using nonlinear extrapolation methods from the experimentally determined stretched flame speeds. The AramcoMech 1.3 kinetics mechanism was validated against flame speeds of ethane, ethylene, and acetylene over a wide range of pressures and equivalence ratios. Good agreement between the measured data and those reported in the literature was seen. The model agreed closely with the measurements at fuel-lean conditions, but a slight over prediction was observed for the fuel-rich cases. Flame speeds of 80/20 and 60/40 (by volume) CH4/C2Hx mixtures in air and in air with excess nitrogen were measured over a wide range of fuel concentrations. In all cases, the addition of ethylene increased the flame speed more than did an equivalent addition of ethane. The Arrhenius effect (predominantly kinetic effect) was the principal driver for flame speed enhancement of methane with ethane/ethylene addition. Sensitivity analysis revealed that thermal and diffusive pathways were equally contributing to the flame speed enhancement of CH4/C2H6 mixtures, but the latter played a comparatively minor role in the C2H4-based blends.",

This work experimentally and numerically investigates the flame properties of formaldehyde (CH2O) and formyl radical (HCO) at high O2 loadings and both atmospheric and reduced pressure by measuring and modeling the laminar burning rates of 1,3,5-trioxane/O2/N2 mixtures. Trioxane is shown to decompose nearly exclusively into high concentrations of formaldehyde early in the flame structure before subsequent flame chemistry reactions occur. Kinetic model predictions show that the flame properties are controlled by CH2O and HCO kinetics. Laminar burning rate predictions of several combustion kinetic models vary significantly in comparison to experimental data and each other; however, all simulations show that the present observations are particularly sensitive to the competition between reactions HCO\u00a0+\u00a0M\u00a0=\u00a0H\u00a0+\u00a0CO\u00a0+\u00a0M (R3) and HCO\u00a0+\u00a0O2\u00a0=\u00a0HO2\u00a0+\u00a0CO (R4). Monte Carlo optimization of these rate coefficients allows interpretation of the measured flame speeds as indirect rate coefficient measurements at flame relevant temperatures. Although results from simple A-factor optimization agree well with the present measurements, three-parameter optimization is shown to be necessary in order to accurately model kinetics across a wide temperature range, including high temperature flames and low temperature direct rate measurements. A-factor and three-parameter optimization both show that a reduced k3/k4 branching ratio over the temperature range from 1100 to 1700\u00a0K improves model predictions compared to present measurements.",

     "abstract": "Laminar burning velocities of hydrogen/air mixtures can show discrepancies up to 30%, making chemical mechanism validation and improvement difficult. The source of uncertainties may come from different factors influencing at each processing and post-processing steps the final value. Considering a spherically expanding flame configuration, reflection on the accuracy of the formulations, used to derive the desired quantity, is proposed. Starting from the exact definition of the laminar burning velocity, two formulations \u2013 direct and indirect flame speeds formulations \u2013 are derived for spherical flames. Each single source of uncertainty involved in the formulations is pointed out. The emphasis is focused on a specific mixture at an equivalence ratio of 0.50, atmospheric pressure, and an initial temperature of 300\u00a0K. This point represents the best tradeoff between low ratio of flame velocity and recording sampling rate and the occurrence of cellular flames (Le\u00a0<\u00a01). An extensive experimental and numerical study (1D spherically expanding flames) of this mixture is carried out. As a result, the experimental laminar burning velocities determined by using the direct flame speed or the indirect flame speed formulae depict different values. However, when numerically determined, both formulae yield the same value. This paves the way to understand and identify the experimental error sources. Stretch and Lewis numbers effects (super-adiabatic temperatures) as well as radiation processes (burned gas motion) are studied. Nonetheless, they do not show to be the main source of uncertainty. The extrapolation procedure (linear or non-linear) according to the limited number of experimental points (rapid apparition of cellular structure) appears as the main factor influencing the discrepancy in laminar burning velocities.",

Detailed analysis on the combustion chemistry of acetylene reveals that C2H2\u00a0+\u00a0O, HCCO\u00a0+\u00a0O2, HCO\u00a0+\u00a0O2, CH3\u00a0+\u00a0HO2, H\u00a0+\u00a0C2H3, CO\u00a0+\u00a0OH, CH2(S)\u00a0+\u00a0C2H2, and HCO decomposition are among the most important reactions, which leads to a new kinetic model (HP Mech) that incorporates the recent understanding of elementary reactions. The effects of CO2 dilution on acetylene flame speeds are found to be small for both fuel rich and lean conditions due to the direct CO2 formation pathway (HCCO\u00a0+\u00a0O2) in acetylene oxidation. Water dilution effects are more pronounced, especially at lean conditions, because the radical pool composition is altered by shifting the equilibrium of H2O\u00a0+\u00a0O\u00a0=\u00a0OH\u00a0+\u00a0OH.

The experimental results show that, the laminar burning velocity is enhanced by the increase in the reactant temperature, irrespective of the equivalence ratio of the mixture. Addition of coal particles in fuel lean (\u03d5\u00a0<\u00a01) mixtures increases the laminar burning velocity initially, but after a certain concentration of dust addition this trend is altered. The dust concentration value, where this variation is observed, increases with increase in reactant temperature.

For \u03d5\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a01, at a given reactant temperature, a linear decay of burning velocity with dust addition is observed. When a combustible dust particle interacts with the flame zone, it extracts energy from the flame and releases volatiles, thereby changing the equivalence ratio. This local increase in the equivalence ratio and the heat sink effect, are found to be influenced by the reactant temperature. A mathematical model including these effects is developed and the model predictions are compared with the experimental results.

The long-term average propagation velocity of the flame front is described by a power law, with a self-acceleration exponent of 1.22 for the flame radius with respect to time.

     "abstract": "The chemical interaction of the two-components of a jet fuel surrogate, n-decane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB), was studied by adding several hundreds ppm of each chemical to two counterflow diffusion flames, one using methane and the other ethylene as baseline fuels. The objective was to look into evidence of synergistic effects due to the interaction of these reference fuels, that are representative of normal alkanes and aromatics, respectively, making up the bulk of practical fuels. The dopants were added in the same proportions as in the Aachen surrogate of jet fuel. The flames presented two distinct environments: the permanently blue methane flame and the incipiently sooting ethylene flame provide well defined temperature\u2013time histories and chemical environments, with the one based on ethylene being relatively more oxygen-deficient. Profiles of critical pyrolysis products and of some stable soot precursors were determined from GC/MS analysis of gas samples extracted from the flames and compared with results from the OPPDIFF model using a lumped chemical mechanism. Mechanistically relevant synergies among the two fuel components are highlighted considering the production rate of aromatics in both flames when adding the two components either simultaneously or separately. The principal observation is that the combined addition of the two components causes an overproduction of methane in the ethylene flame, a decrease in the concentration of acetylene in the methane flame and an acceleration of the aromatic destruction/growth pathways. The model for the most part fails to capture the principal evidence of synergistic effects. Most of the other quantified species reveal no synergy, their concentration being the sum of the contributions of each component used individually, partly because of the small amounts of reactants that were added to the flames.",

Mass spectrometric investigation is one of the often-used techniques to provide mole fractions of stable and reactive intermediates including radicals from specifically designed laboratory experiments. Molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) has been coupled with electron ionization (EI) and photoionization (PI) to determine the species compositions, and combinations of these techniques have been successful in the investigation of the combustion pathways in flames of numerous hydrocarbon, oxygenated and nitrogenated fuels. Photoelectron/photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO) has recently emerged as a novel diagnostics to be combined with flame-sampling mass spectrometry, and its potential as a complement of existing techniques is just about being explored. In a multi-laboratory investigation, the present study has thus combined four different MBMS spectrometers (in Bielefeld, Germany, the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley, USA, the Swiss Light Source in Villigen, Switzerland, and the SOLEIL synchrotron in St. Aubin, France) to study a rich premixed argon-diluted low-pressure (40\u00a0mbar) ethylene\u2013oxygen flame under comparable conditions.

Based on an eigenanalysis of chemical sources terms, chemical source modes and associated reaction modes are distinguished. The dominant mode amplitude is used to determine whether source terms within the flame structure are promoting or counteracting the dominant chemical source mode. Mode sources are then defined from source terms to further differentiate dominant sources (i.e. species or temperature) that promote or counteract a chemical source mode. Similarly, mode participation distinguishes promoting reactions from counteracting ones. Based on mode sources and mode participation, transition temperatures are introduced to track dominant species and reactions within the flame structure. Concepts are detailed for one reference case ( \u03d5 = 0.99 and T in = 302 K ), which is then applied to a large database of simulated test cases with distributed inlet temperature (300\u2013800\u00a0K) and equivalence ratio (0.1\u20131). In all cases, transitions correlate with the adiabatic flame temperature for a simulation.

The effects of distinctive molecular structures on the fuel consumption pathways are clarified. Propanal generates a large H atom pool that enhances the oxidation, leading to the highest flame speeds. However, acetone forms methyl radical (CH3) and has lower flame speeds as a consequence. The calculated maximum concentrations of H, OH, and CH3 confirm this analysis. It is found that propanal yields the highest H and OH concentrations while acetone produces the lowest H and OH concentrations among all tested fuels.

     "abstract": "CFD predictions of flame position, stability and emissions are essential in order to obtain optimized combustor designs in a cost efficient way. However, the numerical modeling of practical combustion systems is a very challenging task. As a matter of fact, the use of detailed reaction mechanisms is necessary for reliable predictions, especially for highly diffusive fuels. Unfortunately, the modeling of the full detail of practical combustion equipment is currently prohibited by the limitations in computing power, given the large number of species and reactions involved. The Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) method reduces these computational costs by several orders of magnitude without loosing too much accuracy. Hereby, FGM enables the application of reliable chemistry mechanisms in CFD simulations of combustion processes. In the FGM technique the progress of the flame is generally described by a few control variables. For each control variable a transport equation is solved during run-time. The flamelet system is computed in a pre-processing stage, and a manifold with all the information about combustion is stored in a tabulated form. In the present paper, the FGM model is implemented for the analysis of partially premixed non-adiabatic flames, including the effects of differential diffusion. Subsequently, a computational analysis of partially premixed non-adiabatic flames is presented. In this scope, a series of test simulations is performed using FGM for a two dimensional geometry, characterized by a distinctive stratified methane/air inlet, and compared with detailed chemistry simulations. The results indicate that detailed simulations are well reproduced with the FGM technique.",

This data covers a range of conditions from weak flames near extinction to strong, highly sooting flames, and enabled the study of gravitational effects on phenomena such as liftoff, blowout and soot formation. The microgravity experiment was carried out in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) on board the International Space Station (ISS), while the normal gravity experiment was performed at Yale utilizing a copy of the flight hardware. Computational simulations of microgravity and normal gravity flames were also carried out to facilitate understanding of the experimental observations. This paper focuses on the different sooting behaviors of CH4 coflow jet flames in microgravity and normal gravity. The unique set of data serves as an excellent test case for developing more accurate computational models. Experimentally, the flame shape and size, lift-off height, and soot temperature were determined from line-of-sight flame emission images taken with a color digital camera. Soot volume fraction was determined by performing an absolute light calibration using the incandescence from a flame-heated thermocouple. Computationally, the MC-Smooth vorticity\u2013velocity formulation was employed to describe the chemically reacting flow, and the soot evolution was modeled by the sectional aerosol equations. The governing equations and boundary conditions were discretized on an axisymmetric computational domain by finite differences, and the resulting system of fully coupled, highly nonlinear equations was solved by a damped, modified Newton\u2019s method. The microgravity sooting flames were found to have lower soot temperatures and higher volume fraction than their normal gravity counterparts.

The model also predicts the dependence of the saturation current on the equivalence ratio well for lean mixtures. Deviations were found in the rich regime, which are largely attributed to shortcomings in the chemical mechanism. For strong applied electric fields the electric current is independent of the applied field strength. This saturation effect is caused by the depletion of electrons from the flame plasma and a domination of the electric forces over Fick diffusion for the cations. According to the simulations, the diodic effect is mostly defined by the distance that the heavier and less mobile ions have to travel to reach the negatively charged electrode.",

     "abstract": "A novel method to establish self-sustaining cool diffusion flames with well-defined boundary conditions is experimentally demonstrated by adding ozone to the oxidizer stream in counterflow configuration. It is found that the atomic oxygen produced through the decomposition of ozone dramatically shortens the induction timescale of the low temperature chemistry, extending the flammable region of cool flames. Thus, it enables the establishment of self-sustaining cool flames at the pressure and timescales at which normal cool flames may not be observable. The present method, for the first time, provides an opportunity to study cool flame dynamics, structure, and chemistry simultaneously in well-known flame geometry. Extinction limits of n-heptane/oxygen cool diffusion flames are measured and a cool diffusion flame diagram is experimentally determined. Numerical simulations reveal that the extinction limits of cool diffusion flames are strongly governed by species transport and low temperature chemistry activated by ozone decomposition. The structure of cool diffusion flame is further investigated by measuring the temperature and species distributions with a micro-probe sampling technique. The kinetic model over-predicts the rate of n-heptane oxidation, the heat release rate, and the flame temperature. Measurements of intermediate species, such as CH2O, acetaldehyde, C2H4, and CH4, suggest that the model over-predicts the QOOH thermal decomposition reactions to form olefins, resulting in substantial over-estimation of C2H4, and CH4 concentrations.

This modification is enhanced by increasing oxygen content, as oxygen exhibits a relatively high paramagnetic susceptibility. Furthermore, the aforementioned modification is shown to enable the shift among similar soot concentration profiles in the flame, just as the variation of oxygen content can do.

The surrogate is a mixture of 50% n-decane/50% methyl-octanoate (molar) to represent methyl-oleate. The combustion chemistry and soot formation are solved using a mechanism with 288 species and 2073 reactions coupled with a sectional soot model, respectively. Soot volume fraction (fv) and temperature profiles are compared to the experimentally measured values for this biodiesel surrogate. In addition, the effects of the ester moiety on soot formation and flame chemistry are studied by numerically comparing the biodiesel surrogate flame with a pure n-decane flame. The model predicts both temperature and fv profiles with a good accuracy. Some discrepancies for fv on the flame centerline are observed between the model and the experiments; it is suggested that these discrepancies are because the model and the experiment cannot distinguish nascent transparent soot from mature soot and because the mechanism under-predicts PAH formation rates. Both n-decane and B100 surrogate flames have similar fv and temperature profiles when both flames have the same energy input. This suggests that the ester moiety does not have a major impact on soot formation. In addition, early production of CO and higher concentrations of some oxygenated species such as formaldehyde are observed in the predicted concentration contour plots of the B100 surrogate flame when they are compared to the n-decane flame. Reaction pathway analysis reveals that the higher peak concentrations of formaldehyde and the early production of CO from CH2CO and CH3CO2 that come directly from the ester moiety in the B100 surrogate are much more pronounced than other species in the B100 surrogate flame and are recognized as the main differentiating characteristics of the B100 surrogate flame from the n-decane flame.",

     "abstract": "Motivated by recent theoretical developments in the dynamics of slow isobaric flames evolving in narrow channels (thick flames), the present study is concerned with non-isobaric flames. A reduced Darcy-like one-dimensional model capable of capturing an abrupt transition from slow conduction-driven to fast compression-driven burning is derived through an appropriate asymptotic procedure. Specifically, the adopted approach is based on the distinguished limit where the scaled width of the channel is deemed comparable to the system\u2019s Mach number, used as a parameter of expansion. The transition is caused by the friction induced gradual pile up of the pressure and hence preheating of the unburned gas adjacent to the advancing flame. The preheating leads to an increase of the flame speed, which in turn promotes further precompression, and so on. Upon some induction period this development leads to a thermal runaway within the reaction zone, triggering the transition.",

     "abstract": "In this work we extend our earlier asymptotic one-dimensional analysis of flame propagation in long narrow channels open at both ends to two-dimensional flames. The analysis follows two tracks; a multi-scale asymptotic study and a full numerical study of the unsteady propagation. We show that during the early stages of propagation the flame accelerates at a nearly constant rate, independent of the channel height. In sufficiently narrow channels, the flame retains a constant acceleration until it reaches the end of the channel, consistent with our earlier work. In wider channels, however, the flame beyond a certain distance begins to accelerate at a nearly-exponential rate, reaching exceedingly large speeds at the end of the channel. The flame self-acceleration arises from the combined effects of gas expansion and lateral confinement. The gas expansion that results from the heat released by the chemical reactions produces a continuous flow of burned gas directed towards the ignition end of the channel. Due to the frictional forces at the walls and, since the pressure at both ends is maintained constant, the gas motion that develops in the burned gas sets a pressure gradient that drives the fresh unburned gas towards the other end of the channel. Stretching out to reach additional fuel, the flame extends towards the fresh mixture propagating faster. And because of lateral confinement, the gas expansion induces large straining on the elongated flame surface that further increases its propagation speed. The asymptotic approximation properly predicts the initial propagation stage, the location within the channel where the sudden acceleration begins and the early stages of the self-accelerating process. The full numerical study confirms and extends the asymptotic results, showing that in long but finite channels premixed flames could self-accelerate reaching velocities that are ten-to-twenty times larger than the laminar flame speed.",

     "abstract": "Propagation of premixed flames in narrow channels is investigated by means of extensive numerical simulations of a complete system of combustion and hydrodynamic equations, incorporating transport properties (thermal conduction, diffusion and viscosity) and Arrhenius chemical kinetics. The system includes mass conservation and Navier\u2013Stokes equations as well as those for the energy and species balance. A flame propagates from the closed end of a channel to the open one. An initially planar flame front gets corrugated due to wall friction and thereby accelerates. It is shown that a flame exhibits an exponential state of acceleration only when the thermal expansion coefficient \u0398 exceeds a certain critical value \u0398 > \u0398 c . The quantity \u0398 c is tabulated as a function of the Reynolds number related to the flame propagation, Re, being \u0398 c \u2248 6 for Re = 5 \u223c 20 . The major flame characteristics such as the flame propagation speed and acceleration rate are scrutinized. It is demonstrated that the acceleration promotes with \u0398 but weakens with Re. In this respect, the present computational results support the theoretical prediction of Bychkov et al. Physical Review E 72 (2005) 046307 in a wide range of \u0398 and Re. While very good quantitative and qualitative agreement between numerical and theoretical results is found for realistically large thermal expansion, \u0398 \u2a7e 8 , agreement deteriorates with decreasing \u0398 . Specifically, while the theory and modeling do not quantitatively agree for \u0398 c < \u0398 < 8 , they nevertheless demonstrate a qualitative resemblance (the exponential state of acceleration). Finally, no exponential acceleration at \u0398 < \u0398 c denotes that the theory completely breaks in that case, but this fits other works in the field and thereby allows reconciling various formulations on the flame acceleration.",

The general ordering of extinction strain rates of hydrocarbon fuels was observed and found to be in general agreement with the predictions of kinetic models and experiments conducted at atmospheric pressure in earlier experiments and computations. An initial linear increase of extinction strain rate with pressure is observed at pressures up to 0.175\u00a0MPa, followed by a general flattening of the curves up to 0.35\u00a0MPa.

     "abstract": "Rate-ratio asymptotic analysis is carried out to elucidate the influence of nitrous oxide on the structure and critical conditions for extinction of nonpremixed methane flames. Steady, axisymmetric, laminar flow of two counterflowing streams toward a stagnation plane is considered. One stream is made up of a mixture of methane and nitrogen. The other stream is a mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen. A reduced mechanism of five global steps is employed in the analysis. Chemical reactions are presumed to take place in a thin reaction zone that is established in the vicinity of the stagnation plane. On either side of this thin reaction zone, the flow field is inert. These inert regions are called outer zones. Methane and nitrous oxide are completely consumed in the reaction zone, while oxygen is presumed to leak through the reaction zone. In the reaction zone, chemical reactions are presumed to take place in two layers\u2014the inner layer and the oxidation layer. In the inner layer fuel (methane) is consumed and the intermediate species hydrogen and carbon monoxide are formed. These intermediate species are oxidized in the oxidation layer to water vapor and carbon dioxide. Radicals are produced in the oxidation layer from chain-branching reactions that consume hydrogen. Asymptotic analysis gives the scalar dissipation rate at extinction. Critical conditions for extinction predicted by the analysis agree well with previous experimental data. Nitrous oxide is found to have an inhibiting effect on the flame, promoting extinction. The inhibiting effect is attributed to the competition between the net reaction of nitrous oxide with hydrogen to form water vapor and nitrogen and the chain-branching reaction between oxygen and hydrogen that produces radicals.",

We use a novel experimental technique of coupling a two-in-line-spark flash system with a double-frame camera in order to obtain microsecond time resolution permitting accurate schlieren velocimetry. The first series of experiments compares the non-reactive sequence of shock reflections with the reflection over a rough wall under identical conditions. It was found that the hot reaction products generated along the rough wall are entrained by the wall jet into a large vortex structure behind the Mach stem. The second series of experiments performed in more sensitive mixtures addressed the sequence of events leading to the detonation establishment along the Mach and transverse waves. Following ignition and jet entrainment, a detonation first appears along the Mach stem while the transverse wave remains non-reactive. The structure of the unburned tongue however indicates local instabilities and hot spot formation, leading to the rapid reaction of this gas.

Several materials were tested as alternatives to soot particles of smoked foil technique to record detonation structure. The experimental results show that the triple point trajectory coincides with the soot track and that cellular cell-like patterns are obtained for CaCO3 particles, fly ash, heat-sensitive paper, and pressure-sensitive paper. An asymmetrical cellular pattern in the smoked plate record is exhibited in the case of the pressure-sensitive paper, while a symmetrical pattern is observed for the other materials. This asymmetry is successfully explained by the temporal response of the pressure-sensitive paper from evaluation of time integration of pressure, namely impulse to time varying loading. Estimation of wall shear stress and tensile strength of agglomerated particles layer on the basis of an analogy to particle entrainment from fine powder layers shows the critical particle diameter for removal of particles. However, the shear stress is found to be not strong enough for removal of particles located in the triple point trajectory. Finally other additional mechanisms for local detachment of particles are discussed.",

     "abstract": "The structure of oblique detonation waves stabilized on a hypersonic wedge in mixtures characterized by a large activation energy is investigated via steady method of characteristics (MoC) calculations and unsteady computational flowfield simulations. The steady MoC solutions show that, after the transition from shock-induced combustion to an overdriven oblique detonation, the shock and reaction complex exhibit a spatial oscillation. The degree of overdrive required to suppress this oscillation was found to be nearly equal to the overdrive required to force a one-dimensional piston-driven detonation to be stable, demonstrating the equivalence of two-dimensional steady oblique detonations and one-dimensional unsteady detonations. Full unsteady computational simulations of the flowfield using an adaptive refinement scheme showed that these spatial oscillations are transient in nature, evolving in time into transverse waves on the leading shock front. The formation of left-running transverse waves (facing upstream) precedes the formation of right-running transverse waves (facing downstream). Both sets of waves are convected downstream away from the wedge in the supersonic flow behind the leading oblique front, such that the mechanism of instability must continuously generate new transverse waves from an initially uniform flow. Together, these waves define a cellular structure that is qualitatively similar to a normal propagating detonation.",

     "abstract": "Expanding reaction fronts are central to many terrestrial processes as well as such cosmic phenomena as the thermonuclear combustion in supernovae. While in terrestrial conditions the effect of intrinsic flamefront instabilities is generally believed to be supplementary to, say, external turbulence and chamber dynamics, at the astrophysical scale the role of flamefront instabilities in the flame acceleration is presumably dominant. Moreover, while in terrestrial systems we focus mainly on the hydrodynamic, Darrieus\u2013Landau (DL) instability, the Rayleigh\u2013Taylor (RT), body-force instability could be a key issue for astrophysical flames because of the enormous gravity and the associated large scales. Consequently, if RT effects dominate over DL effects, the globally-spherical flamefront can be replaced by an expanding bubble with a non-spherical shape, possibly that of digit \u201c8\u201d. In the present work we have developed a self-similar formulation describing a globally-spherical expanding flamefront corrugated due to the DL instability in a central gravitation field. The associated scenario of the flame acceleration, the evolution of the upstream flow, and the instant when a gas parcel ahead of the flamefront first explodes, hence initiating the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT), as well as the radial coordinate of this parcel, are determined. We have also compared the effects of DL and RT instabilities, estimating whether a globally-spherical, DL-corrugated flamefront is subsequently terminated by the formation of RT bubbles. It is shown how the instant of such a transition and the relevant global flame radius are coupled to various flame and flow parameters.",

The unsteady results obtained in three dimensions revealed the generation mechanism of the wave front structures of two-, three- and four-cell mode detonations. A six-cell mode detonation could be obtained using a finer grid. With the increase in pre-exponential factor, it was found that the number of detonation cells is increased while the cell size is reduced accordingly. In all the multi-cell modes, the detonation wave structures and smoked-foil records on the wall are formed by the propagation of transverse waves along the wall in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, while the slapping wave moves in the radial direction. The presence of the slapping wave further strengthens the wave interactions in three-dimensional simulation. Comparison with two-dimensional simulation confirms the effect of the slapping wave in the radial direction.

The present results indicate that well within the limit, the detonation velocity is generally a few percent below the theoretical Chapman\u2013Jouguet (CJ) value. As the limit is approached, the velocity decreases rapidly to a minimum value before the detonation fails. The narrow range of values of d/\u03bb of the mixture where the velocity drops rapidly is found to correspond to the range of values for the onset of single headed spinning detonations.

The detonable mixtures were stoichiometric oxygen mixtures with acetylene, ethylene or hydrogen. They were diluted with argon in a 50% volumetric fraction, and a 75% diluted mixture was also tested for the acetylene/oxygen. The direct initiation of detonation by the projectile and the DDT process like the re-initiation appeared in the initiation process of stabilized ODW. This process eventually led to the stabilized ODW supported by the projectile velocity and the ringed shape detonation wave originating in the re-initiation. We modeled the spatial evolution of stabilized ODW after the re-initiation based on its C\u2013J velocity and angle. The model qualitatively reproduced the measured development rate of stabilized ODW. We also discussed about the detonation stability for the curvature effect arising from the three-dimensional nature of stabilized ODW around the projectile. The curvature effect attenuated the detonation wave below its C\u2013J velocity at the vicinity of projectile. The propagation limits of curvature effect will be responsible for the criticality to attain the stabilized ODWs.

A total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme is used for the mixture of H2/Air, and an advection upwind splitting method difference vector (AUSMDV) scheme is used for the mixture of H2/O2. The use of an AUSMDV scheme provides a much clearer detonation structure than does the TVD scheme. We focus on the complex interaction mechanism of the detonation front and burned mixture gases.

     "abstract": "Rotating detonation engines (RDE\u2019s) represent a logical step from pulsed detonation engine concepts to a continuous detonation engine concept for obtaining propulsion from the high efficiency detonation cycle. The hydrogen/air and hydrogen/oxygen RDE concepts have been most extensively studied, however, being able to use hydrocarbon fuels is essential for practical RDE\u2019s. The current paper extends our hydrogen/air model to hydrocarbon fuels with both air and pure oxygen as the oxidizer. Before beginning the RDE calculations, several detonation tube results are summarized showing the ability of the code to reproduce the correct detonation velocity and CJ properties. In addition, a calculation capturing the expected irregular detonation cell patterns of ethylene/air is also shown. To do the full range of fuels and oxidizers, we found the use of temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties to be essential, especially for hydrocarbon/oxygen mixtures. The overall results for air-breathing RDE\u2019s with hydrocarbons ranged from 1990 to 2540\u00a0s, while in pure oxygen mode the specific impulse varied from 700 to 1070\u00a0s. These results were between 85% and 89% of the expected ideal detonation cycle results, and are in line with previous hydrogen/air estimates from our previous work. We conclude from this that hydrocarbon RDE\u2019s are viable and that the basic flow-field patterns and behaviors are very similar to the hydrogen/air cases detailed previously.",

The detonation in a narrow channel with d\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0mm, which is approximately twice the half-reaction length of hydrogen, shows a feature of galloping detonation with two initiations during its propagation under the laminar flow assumption. The distance between these two initiations is approximately 1300\u00a0mm, which causes the induction time behind the leading shock wave. As the channel width increases, the galloping feature diminishes. The detonation propagates approximately 4% lower than DCJ for d\u00a0=\u00a010 and 15\u00a0mm. By increasing the channel width, the strength of the detonation increases, as shown in the maximum pressure histories. The effects of turbulence behind the detonation show that the galloping feature disappears, although its propagation velocity becomes 0.9\u00a0DCJ. The strength of the detonation becomes significantly weak compared with the detonation propagating in the wide channel widths, and this feature is similar to the laminar assumption. The trend of the velocity deficits in the NS simulations agrees fairly well with the trend of the modified ZND calculations with \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a00.25.",

The effective activation energy of the H2\u2013air mixture, based on constant-volume ignition delay times computed using the detailed thermochemical model, varies between 5 and 40 over the range of post-shock temperatures and pressures in the simulations and is, on average, significantly larger than expected based on the regularity of experimental cellular patterns.

Visualizations showed that the outward propagating reaction wave was initially smooth and circular, but petal-like wrinkles quickly developed on the flame ring. Flame wrinkles appeared earlier and closer to the ignition point as the gap width became smaller. The flame underwent fast acceleration during the onset of flame wrinkling, but the acceleration was relatively mild as the wrinkled flame ring continued to expand. Time exponents for the accelerative growth of corrugated flame rings were identical in the two highly confined gaps. The flame ring underwent deflagration-to-detonation transition as the propagation velocities abruptly surged from 1000\u00a0m/s to over 2000\u00a0m/s. The arc-shaped detonation waves initiated from local explosion spots on the flame ring were propagating at near Chapman\u2013Jouguet velocities.

Owing to the model\u2019s simplicity, the ignition and acceleration mechanism is explained using the two families of characteristics admitted by the model. The energy release along the particle paths provides the amplification of forward-traveling pressure waves. These waves pre-compress the medium in the induction layer ahead of the reaction zone, therefore changing the induction delays of successive particles. The variation of the induction delay provides the modulation of the amplification of the forward traveling pressure waves by controlling the residence time of the pressure waves in the reaction zone. A closed form analytical solution is obtained by the method of characteristics and high activation energy asymptotics. The acceleration of the reaction zone was found to be proportional to the product of the activation energy, the ratio of the induction to reaction time and the heat release. This finding provides a theoretical justification for the previous use of this non-dimensional number to characterize the ignition regimes observed experimentally in detonations and shock induced ignition phenomena. Numerical simulations are presented and analyzed. Both subsonic and supersonic internal flame propagation are observed, consistent with experiment and previous reactive Euler models.",

Ignition takes place near the closed end; experiments then show that the flame accelerates, slows down and moves back, accelerates again, and may eventually reach considerable speeds. The one-dimensional analysis is based upon the assumption that the flame front propagates at a speed that is small compared to the speed of sound, and that depends upon the temperature and pressure perturbation due to acoustics that it encounters. A complete unsteady solution is constructed. The tube acoustics are set in motion by the expansion of the fluid due to ignition at the closed end. Subsequently, both spectrum and amplitude evolve because of the motion of the temperature interface, and because of forcing by the flame front, which itself depends upon the effect of acoustics on the state of the fluid that it encounters. Oscillations in the front position are stronger than in a previous study in which the flame propagation speed was taken to be constant. With the additional feedback now included, it is strong enough to result in strong flow reversal.",

The possibility of self-ignition near an obstacle is a realistic concern in practical applications such as a hydrogen car, but only a few studies related to this issue have been conducted. In this paper, experimental investigations were carried out to understand the effects of a wall on ignition patterns by high-speed imaging. This study was conducted using extension tubes of different lengths at burst pressures up to 30\u00a0MPa. The wall height, distance of the wall from the tube exit and the burst pressure were considered as the main wall parameters affecting self-ignition. The results showed that the existence of a wall could not change the type of ignition patterns (i.e., the wall does not initiate or extinguish a flame) regardless of the wall height and burst pressure, but only when the tube was too short to generate a strong flame inside the tube. When the tube was long enough to induce a strong flame in the tube, however, the wall promoted flame stabilization, e.g., the flame stabilization time outside the tube was shortened by locating the wall near the tube. But its effect disappeared when the distance of the wall from the tube exceeded 10D.",

The storage of high-pressure hydrogen gas conditions is preferred to its storage in cryogenic liquid state. However, cases of unidentified self-ignitions were reported, notably when the high-pressure hydrogen gas suddenly leaked out. Only a few of numerical simulations have shown visually the processes of the self-ignition inside a tube. This paper presents a flow visualization study to investigate the self-ignition mechanism in a test tube i.e. how the ignition process is initiated and the flame propagates. In addition to visualization, measurement of a number of pressure and light sensors installed in the tube supported the analysis of the self-ignition and flame propagation. The test result showed that self-ignition takes place at the boundary layer behind the front center of mixing zone at first, and the flame propagates to the front of mixing zone and tail of the mixing zone along the boundary layer. It showed that self-ignition is accompanied with complex mixing induced by shock interaction with the mixing front. It is also suggested that the self-ignition boundary has a certain critical threshold of static pressure at the boundary layer, based on various burst pressures of hydrogen.",

Experiments have been conducted at relatively large beam sizes, where ignition times are a function of the irradiance. Particles in the form of fine powders were placed into a chamber filled with ignitable butane/air mixtures. Possible ignition is shown for a range of carbon based materials including different carbon blacks, graphite, the C60 fullerene and diamond powder, as well as for non-reactive powders such as silicon carbide, iron-, copper- and silicon oxides. The irradiance was varied independently and results are shown to become independent of the size of the irradiated area if a sufficiently large area is illuminated. The particle size was found to have a significant impact on the time to ignition. Specifically, finer particles lead to shorter ignition times due to the higher surface area to volume ratio which reduces both particle and gas heating times. Ignition could be achieved across the whole flammability range of butane/air using carbon black and silicon carbide particles, although, near the rich flammability no ignition could be obtained with carbon black.",

The combustion spreading from the cavity shear layer to the main stream seemed to be dominated not only by the traditional diffusion process but also by the convection process associated with the extended recirculation flows resulting from the heat release and the interaction between the jet and the cavity shear layer. Therefore, the cavity-stabilized combustion appeared to be a strongly coupled process of flow and heat release around the cavity flameholder.",

Here, a comprehensive numerical study has been carried out for the HyShot II scramjet combustor. This study makes use of Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (RANS) based models and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) based models with semi-detailed reaction kinetics. In this investigation we focus on the underlying flow-mixing-combustion physics at different operating conditions tested in the High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel G\u00f6ttingen (HEG). To account for the complex flow in the HEG facility a zonal approach is employed in which RANS is used to simulate the flow in the HEG nozzle and test-section, providing the necessary inflow boundary conditions for the combustor RANS and LES, being the focus of this analysis. Specifically, we here combine results from RANS and LES computations with data from the HEG experiments and the target HyShot II flight-tests at two different flight-altitudes (28 and 33\u00a0km). The LES model is observed to capture the experimental wall-pressure and heat-flux data very well for both the 33 and 28\u00a0km altitude cases, whereas the RANS model is only able to predict the wall-pressure and heat flux data for the 28\u00a0km altitude case. Based on the LES results, the flow at both altitudes is found to be unsteady, but with unsteady transitional flow features dominating the 33\u00a0km case. Moreover, these results show that the equivalence ratio is of key importance to the resulting flow, mixing and combustion physics, with richer mixtures being prone to transitional flow features. The LES results are also used to describe the flow physics in detail for both altitudes, and the key processes responsible for the transition between the two combustion modes observed.",

In oxyfuel combustion, combustion gas is oxygen and recirculating flue gas (FGR) and main component of combustion gas is O2, CO2 and H2O rather than O2, N2 in air combustion. Fundamental researches showed that flame temperature and flame propagation velocity of pulverized cloud in oxyfuel combustion are lower than that in air with the same O2 concentration due to higher heat capacity of CO2. IHI pilot combustion test showed that stable burner combustion was obtained over 30% O2 in secondary combustion gas and the same furnace heat transfer as that of air firing at 27% O2 in overall combustion gas. Compared to emissions in air combustion, NOx emission per unit combustion energy decreased to 1/3 due to reducing NOx in the FGR, and SOx emission was 30% lower. However SOx concentration in the furnace for the oxyfuel mode was three to four times greater than for the air mode due to lower flow rate of exhaust gas. The higher SO3 concentration results that the sulphuric acid dew point increases 15\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C compared to the air combustion.

The formulations are based on a bimodal size distribution of AP particles. Ten of the formulations exhibit one or two plateaus/mesa in their burning rate variation with pressure (zero/negative pressure exponent of burning rate). The relevant formulation variables, namely, coarse and fine AP sizes and coarse-to-fine ratio, aluminium size and content, and two different curing agents, have been varied. Tests are performed in the 1\u201310\u00a0MPa pressure range. A direct correlation between burning rate and agglomerate size exists for propellants with normal burning rate trends but a neutral or inverse correlation is observed for those exhibiting plateau burning behaviour. Larger the parent aluminium size, lesser the agglomeration, as expected; but the effect of aluminium content is non-monotonic. The coarse AP size influences the aluminium agglomerate size as expected from the pocket model regardless of plateau burning effects. The agglomerate size decreases with increase in fine AP size, however. A computer model developed earlier at this laboratory for prediction of aluminium agglomerates based on three-dimensional packing of particles and deduction of AP particles with attached leading edge diffusion flames is applied to the present formulations. The model under-predicts the agglomerate size, only marginally for propellants that do not exhibit plateau burning rate trends, but substantially, otherwise. This is because it does not take into account effects of binder melt flow and is independent of the curing agent of the binder.",

     "abstract": "A previously developed flame synthesis method was applied to the preparation of mesoporous titania films for application in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The method combines the synthesis of narrowly sized, ultrafine metal oxide particles with controllable chemical and phase purity and the deposition of these particles into a uniform, porous thin film in a single step. The current work used a series of ethylene\u2013oxygen\u2013argon flames to produce DSSC anode films of wide ranging properties. The performance of the solar cells prepared with these anode films was studied at the fundamental level with respect to variations of the titania crystal phase purity and content resulting from changes primarily from flame stoichiometry changes. Based on the basic relationship established among flame synthesis condition-material property-cell performance, a highly efficient DSSC was designed, which shows photocurrent densities better than some of the best performing cells reported to date. Additional studies have focused on a demonstration of the suitability of the flame process in engineering TiO2 films structurally and chemically with the potential of further improved DSSC efficiency.",

     "abstract": "Hybrid metal oxide nanowires (NWs), with small characteristic diameter and large aspect ratio, can have unique and yet tunable chemical, optical and electrical properties by independently controlling the chemical compositions and morphologies of the individual components. Such hybrid NWs are promising building blocks in many applications, such as catalysis, sensors, batteries, solar cells and photoelectrochemical devices. However, these applications are hindered by the lack of scalable and economic methods for the synthesis of hybrid NWs. Here, we report a simple, scalable and new sol-flame method to synthesize various hybrid metal oxide NWs, including nanoparticle-shell decorated NWs (NP-shell@NW), NP-chain decorated NW (NP-chain@NW) and doped NWs. The sol-flame process first coats existing NWs with NPs or dopants precursors prepared by the sol\u2013gel process, and then dissociates/oxidizes these precursors in flame. The sol-flame method uniquely combines the merits of the flame process (e.g., high temperature and fast heating rate) with low temperature sol\u2013gel method (e.g., broad material choices and excellent chemical composition control). For both the NP-shell@NW and NP-chain@NW cases, the high temperature flame, compared to furnace, provides much faster heating rate and shorter duration for annealing, which evaporates and burns the precursor solvent rapidly, causing NPs to quickly nucleate around NWs without significant agglomeration. Hence, higher loading density of NPs with smaller sizes is decorated to the NWs, and the formed hybrid NP@NW exhibits significantly higher catalytic activity than that of the furnace-annealed sample. Similarly when using the sol-flame method to dope NWs, the high temperature flame enables rapid dopant diffusion and short annealing duration that maintains the morphology of the original materials and protects the delicate NW substrates from damage. We believe that the new sol-flame method can be applied to synthesize various 1-D hybrid metal oxide nanostructures, thereby impacting diverse application fields.",

     "abstract": "Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is a technologically important material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting for the solar production of hydrogen fuel from water. For PEC water-splitting, high aspect ratio WO3 nanostructures such as nanowires (NWs) and nanotubes (NTs) are superior to planar WO3 films because they orthogonalize the directions of light absorption (along the long axis) and charge transport (across the short radius), leading to both efficient light absorption and charge carrier collection. However, PEC water-splitting requires the growth of WO3 on delicate transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates that cannot tolerate high temperature processing. To date, the large-scale, rapid, economical synthesis of high aspect ratio WO3 nanostructures on these delicate TCO substrates remains a major challenge. Previously, we synthesized WO3 NW arrays by a rapid, atmospheric and scalable flame vapor deposition (FVD) method, in which a flame oxidizes and evaporates tungsten metal to produce tungsten oxide vapors that condense onto a colder substrate in the form of NWs. Nevertheless, at substrate temperatures low enough to ensure the health of the TCO, the growth of WO3 NW arrays was non-uniform and sparse due to limitations of the experimental design. Herein, we significantly improve the FVD design to grow uniform and densely packed WO3 nanostructures on TCO substrates, thereby enabling the application of these WO3 nanostructures to PEC water-splitting. The morphology of the nanostructures varied from densely packed multi-shell NTs and single-shell NTs to NWs as we increased the substrate temperature in the range 530\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C. Importantly, the WO3 NTs synthesized by FVD had higher areal number density and longer length than state-of-the-art WO3 NW photoanodes grown by chemical vapor deposition and hydrothermal methods, resulting in stronger light absorption and superior PEC water-splitting performance. Thus, in addition to being scalable, rapid and economical, the FVD method also synthesizes materials of high quality.",

Spontaneous ignition temperature, determined from the inflection-point of the temporal variation of surface temperature, is found to decrease at first, reach the minimum, and then increase gradually, with increasing size ratio, being defined as the ratio of compact and particle diameters and reported to be useful in correlating experimental results. The lowest temperature observed is as low as that, more than 200\u00a0K below the melting point 934\u00a0K of Al, at the size ratio of c.a. 700. While its decrease is attributed to the increase in the particle surface per unit spatial volume of compacted mixture, as reported in the literature, its increase found in the course of the present study can fairly be correlated to an enhancement of heat loss from each particle in the compacted mixture, by conducting a theoretical consideration. As for the dependence of spontaneous ignition temperature on the mixture ratio, a shifting occurs from a decreasing trend with increasing mixture ratio at small size ratios, less than about 700, to an insensitive trend to the mixture ratio, had not been reported in the literature. In addition, a fair degree of agreement, shown in experimental comparisons with theoretical results, indicates that the present formulation has captured the essential features of the spontaneous ignition of compacted mixture, especially for size ratios with large values. Since this kind of particle size effects, relevant to the spontaneous ignition of the compacted mixtures, has not been captured in the previous studies, its elucidation can be considered not only notable but also useful, in manipulating combustion process in materials synthesis, especially, in choosing a specific condition for the lowest spontaneous ignition temperature by varying the size ratio.",

Early time reaction of aluminum acts to enhance the primary explosive blast, and this reaction is approximately half aerobic and half anaerobic (i.e. oxidation by detonation products and/or nitridation), suggesting that very rapid early-time mixing occurs in explosive fireballs. Particle size effects are surprisingly negligible over the range of 3\u201340\u00a0\u03bcm, which implies that conventional scaling laws for aluminum combustion provide less insight than previously assumed. Quasi-static pressures obtained in the time period from 5 to 10\u00a0microns after detonation suggest that oxidation of aluminum is complete in the presence of 20% oxygen. However, for nitrogen environments, oxidation only proceeds to half its theoretical maximum, except for the smallest (3\u00a0\u03bcm particles) for which oxidation was nearly complete. These results demonstrate that oxidation of aluminum in aluminized explosives is robust in anaerobic environments, and that simulation efforts cannot neglect anaerobic channels, even though aerobic oxidation provides the greatest energy release.",

The burning velocities of the resulting two-phase hybrid flame are determined using the total surface area of the inner flame cone and the known volumetric flow rate, and spatially resolved flame spectra are obtained with a spectral scanning system. Flame temperatures are derived through polychromatic fitting of Planck\u2019s law to the continuous part of the spectrum. It is found that an increase in the solid fuel concentration changes the aluminum combustion regime from low temperature oxidation to full-fledged flame front propagation. For stoichiometric methane\u2013air mixtures, the transition occurs in the aluminum concentration range of 140\u2013220\u00a0g/m3 and is manifested by the appearance of AlO sub-oxide bands and an increase in the flame temperature to 2500\u00a0K. The flame burning velocity is found to decrease only slightly with an increase in aluminum concentration, in contrast to the rapid decrease in flame speed, followed by quenching, that is observed for flames seeded with inert SiC particles. The observed behavior of the burning velocity and flame temperature leads to the conclusion that intense aluminum combustion in a hybrid flame only occurs when the flame front propagating through the aluminum suspension is coupled to the methane\u2013air flame.",

A multi-zone theoretical framework is established to predict the burning rate and temperature distribution by solving the energy equation in each zone and matching the temperature and heat flux at the interfacial boundaries. The burning rates are measured experimentally by burning aluminum\u2013ice strands in a constant-volume vessel. For stoichiometric ALICE mixtures with 80\u00a0nm particles, the burning rate shows a pressure dependence of rb\u00a0=\u00a0aPn, with an exponent of 0.33.

Flame synthesis is an attractive method to grow 1-D complex metal oxide nanostructures because of its high temperature, scalability, low-cost and rapid growth rate. Here, we present three new combined flame synthesis methods: (1) simultaneous vapor\u2013vapor growth, (2) simultaneous solid\u2013vapor growth, and (3) sequential solid\u2013vapor growth, to grow 1-D complex metal oxide nanostructures with well-defined compositions and morphologies. These three methods combine the previously reported flame vapor deposition and solid diffusion growth methods that were separately used to grow 1-D simple binary metal oxide nanostructures, and significantly advance the capabilities of existing flame synthesis methods for the growth of 1-D nanomaterials. The first method, simultaneous vapor\u2013vapor growth, combines the flame vapor deposition growth of two different metal oxides by oxidizing and evaporating two different metal sources. With this we have successfully grown W-doped MoO3 nanoplates and nanoflowers. In the second method, simultaneous solid\u2013vapor growth, one precursor is again provided by oxidizing and evaporating metal oxide from a metal, while the other precursor diffuses out from a different growth substrate. With this we have successfully grown ternary Cu3Mo2O9 nanowires. The third method, sequential solid\u2013vapor growth, essentially uses the 1-D nanostructures firstly grown by solid diffusion as the substrates for subsequent flame vapor deposition. With this we have successfully grown hierarchical CuO/MoO3 core/shell nanowires and MoO3-branched CuO nanowires. We believe that these three new combined flame synthesis methods will provide a general platform for the synthesis of 1-D complex metal oxide nanostructures with tailored properties.",

Particle emission traces are recorded, and a data processing routine is established for discounting emission signals produced by unignited particles and particles partially combusted within the CO2 laser beam. Burn times and combustion temperatures are measured and compared to earlier measurements for coarser particles of the same metals. For both metals, average combustion temperatures implied by the emission spectra are very close to their respective adiabatic flame temperatures.

Recently, self-sustained combustion in the mixtures of JSC-1A lunar regolith and magnesium has been demonstrated. However, the concentration of magnesium in those mixtures was as high as 26\u00a0wt%. Note that magnesium must be either transported from Earth or recovered from lunar minerals or used structures. The present paper focuses on the minimization of magnesium content in JSC-1A/Mg mixtures. The mixtures were compacted into pellets and ignited in argon environment. Initial attempts to decrease magnesium concentration resulted in the observations of a spinning combustion wave at 23\u00a0wt% Mg. The observed spin combustion involved periodical motion of two counterpropagating hot spots along a helical path on the sample surface. These observations, including features such as formation of a faster hot spot after collision of the counterpropagating spots, confirm theoretical predictions for spin combustion in solid\u2013solid mixtures. High-energy mechanical milling of JSC-1A in a planetary ball mill significantly increased its reactivity and improved combustion of its mixtures with magnesium. Mixtures of the obtained powder (the median diameter of about 3\u00a0\u03bcm) with 26\u00a0wt% Mg exhibit easy ignition and vigorous combustion. The minimum concentration of magnesium required for self-sustained propagation of a planar combustion front is as low as 13\u00a0wt%.",

The existence of hetero- and homogeneous reactions in the combustor relies on sufficient catalytically induced exothermicity as well as sufficient hydrogen in the remaining mixture. Besides, the multi-segment catalyst with cavities appreciably extends the stable operating range of catalytic combustion in a small-scale combustor for a wide range of inflow velocities.

The employed reaction schemes reproduced the measured catalytic reactant consumption, the onset of homogeneous ignition, and the post-ignition flame shapes at all examined conditions. Although below a critical pressure, which depended on temperature, the intrinsic gas-phase kinetics of hydrogen dictated lower reactivity for the fuel-rich stoichiometries when compared to fuel-lean ones, homogeneous ignition was still more favorable for the rich stoichiometries due to the lower molecular transport of the deficient oxygen reactant that resulted in modest catalytic reactant consumption over the gaseous induction zone. Above the critical pressure, the intrinsic gaseous hydrogen kinetics yielded higher reactivity for the rich stoichiometries, which resulted in vigorous gaseous combustion at pressures up to 5\u00a0bar, in contrast to lean stoichiometry studies whereby homogeneous combustion was altogether suppressed above 3\u00a0bar. Computations at fuel-rich stoichiometries in practical channel geometries indicated that homogeneous combustion was not of concern for reactor thermal management, since the larger than unity Lewis number of the deficient oxygen reactant confined the flames to the core of the channel, away from the solid walls.",

Heat transfer from the hot catalytic walls laminarized the flow, as manifested by the progressive suppression of the high vorticity components of the flow aligned parallel to the channel walls at increasing streamwise distances. The impact of turbulence suppression on the mass transfer towards or away from the catalytic wall was subsequently assessed. Far upstream where high turbulence fluctuations persisted, the instantaneous local transverse gradient of the limiting hydrogen reactant (a quantity proportional to the catalytic reaction rate) as well as the instantaneous hydrogen concentration at the wall exhibited strong fluctuations by up to 300%, a result of finite-rate chemistry induced by the high inrush events towards the catalytic walls. Fourier analysis of the reaction rate fluctuations yielded peak frequencies of less than 1\u00a0kHz, values comparable to the thermal response frequencies of typical materials in commercial catalytic geometries. This has direct implications on the thermal stress of the reactor walls as well as on the decoupling between flow and solid thermal modeling currently used in practical catalytic reactors.

The Freeman\u2013Carroll method is suitable to describe the soot combustion in the NO/O2/He atmosphere, with the activation energies for the catalysts in the range of 97\u2013112\u00a0kJ/mol and the average value of reaction order equal to 1.36.",

The light-off temperatures are identified by means of the sudden increase of the catalyst temperature when linearly heating the catalyst for various fuel/oxygen ratios. For hydrogen and all hydrocarbons studied, the results show a rise of ignition temperature with increasing fuel/oxygen ratio, whereas the opposite trend is observed for the light-off of CO oxidation. Hydrogen oxidation, however, shows an opposite trend compared to previous investigations, performed on platinum [1], [2].",

The nascent tar samples were collected using a wire-mesh reactor where the secondary reactions of the evolved volatiles were minimized. The small compounds, such as benzenes and alkanes, were not detected in nascent tar in wire-mesh reactor, whose components are quite different from those of other tars in tube type reactor and vacuum reactor. At a heating rate of 1000\u00a0K/s, the quasi-3 rings and 3 rings group aromatics were the major components in nascent tar; while the content of 2 rings group aromatics increased from 7.02% to 31.75% with increasing peak temperature from 500 to 800\u00a0\u00b0C. At a longer holding time of 300\u00a0s, an increase of 2 rings group aromatics from 7.02% to 50.33% was also observed for the nascent tar at 500\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating that the tar composition significantly changed at different stages of PVC pyrolysis. It seems that 3\u20134 rings compounds form in the early stage and then 2 rings compounds release in the later stage of PVC pyrolysis. Based on the experimental results in this work, a new four-stage mechanism, including (1) dechlorination accompanied with inner cyclization, (2) aromatic chain scission, (3) release of quasi-3 rings or 3 rings group, and (4) release of 2 rings group, of the PVC tar formation was proposed.",

Also observed was a slow release of alkali after shutting off the fuel feed, which suggests that alkali species had been taken up in the bed material (olivine); this was confirmed by analysing the bed material before and after use. Consideration of the olivine structure/composition and possible interactions with alkali and other elements during gasification suggests that alkali-containing layers could have formed on the bed particles but appear not to form crystalline phases. This may allow for re-release of alkali while the bed is still hot.",

Using biomass for fuel is considered carbon neutral, and O2/CO2 biomass combustion can mitigate the deleterious environmental effect of greenhouse. In this study, the effect of CO2, the main component gas in O2/CO2 combustion, on the pyrolysis characteristics of biomass is investigated. Cellulose, lignin, and metal-depleted lignin pyrolysis experiments were performed using a thermobalance. Information on the surface chemistry of the chars was obtained by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to investigate changes in the surface chemistry during pyrolysis under different surrounding gasses. When the temperature increased to 1073\u00a0K at heating rate of 1\u00a0K\u00a0s\u22121, the char yield of lignin in the presence of CO2 increased by about 10% compared with that under Ar. However, for cellulose and metal-depleted lignin, no significant difference appeared between pyrolysis under CO2 and that under Ar. FT-IR showed that a strong peak corresponding to carbonate ions appeared in the char derived from lignin under CO2. Therefore, salts such as Na2CO3 or K2CO3 formed during the lignin pyrolysis under CO2. At around 1650\u20131770\u00a0cm\u22121, a significant difference appeared in the FTIR spectra of chars formed under CO2 and those formed under Ar. C=O groups not associated with an aromatic ring were found only in chars formed under CO2. It was suggested that these salts affected the char formation reaction, in that the char formed during lignin pyrolysis under CO2 had unique chemical bands that did not appear in the lignin-derived char prepared under Ar.",

The pyrolysis process of poplar biomass, a potential biofuel feedstock, has been studied with tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet (SVUV) photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS). The mass spectra at different photon energies, temperatures, and time-evolved profiles of selected species during poplar pyrolysis process were measured. Our results reveal that poplar is typical of hardwood according to its relative contents of three lignin monomeric precursors. As temperature increases from 300 to 700\u00a0\u00b0C, the overall intensities of pyrolysis products decrease due to the gas-phase cracking. Observed intensities of syringyl and guaiacyl subunits of lignin in poplar at low temperature present different trends: the intensities of syringyl subunits of lignin undergo an increase firstly and then a decrease, whereas those of guaiacyl subunits of lignin show decrease continuously. Time-dependent data demonstrate that hemicellulose pyrolysis is faster than lignin in poplar.

     "abstract": "Studies of the release of critical ash-forming elements from combustion of biomass are typically conducted with small sample masses under well controlled conditions. In biomass combustion on a grate, secondary recapture and release reactions in the fuel-bed may affect the overall release and partitioning of these elements. Earlier work by the authors on the release of K, Cl, and S from a high-chlorine biomass (corn stover) in a lab-scale setup is, in the present work, supplemented with novel results from a bench-scale fixed bed reactor and a 100\u00a0kW moving grate pilot facility. The results from the bench-scale reactor indicate that S and K release are not significantly affected by secondary reactions, while Cl is partly recaptured by secondary reactions in the char. A linear increase in K-release was observed from 50% at 906\u00a0\u00b0C to almost 80\u00a0wt.% at 1234\u00a0\u00b0C when firing only corn stover. A similar release profile was observed for Cl, from 65% to nearly 100%. Complete release of S was achieved at 1234\u00a0\u00b0C with a linear increase from 70% at 906\u00a0\u00b0C. Co-combustion of corn stover with low-Cl wood chips served to increase the bed temperature, resulting in complete and close to complete release of Cl and S, respectively. An increase in the relative K-release was observed when increasing the wood chip fraction from 40% to 100% (energy basis). Pilot scale flue gas results indicate that the share of Cl released as HCl decreases towards 0% as the share of wood chips is increased towards 100%. Hence, co-combustion of corn stover with wood chips is expected to decrease the absolute release of KCl due to the lower feedstock quantity of Cl, however, increase the relative release of Cl as KCl.",

The discrete representation of biomass and sand particles in the simulation bridges accurate numerical modelling with reproducing realistic phenomena seen experimentally.

Three Chinese coals of different ranks (i.e., DT bituminous coal, CF lignite, and YQ anthracite) were devolatilized at 1300\u00a0\u00b0C in N2 and CO2 atmosphere, respectively, in a drop tube furnace (DTF). The resulting N2-chars and CO2-chars were burned at 1300\u00a0\u00b0C in both air-firing (O2/N2\u00a0=\u00a021/79) and oxy-firing (O2/CO2\u00a0=\u00a021/79). The effects of char properties and combustion conditions on PM10 formation during char combustion were studied. It was found that the formation modes and particle size distribution of PM10 from char combustion whether in air-firing or in oxy-firing were similar to those from pulverized coal combustion. The significant amounts of PM0.5 (particles less than or equal to 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter) generated from combustion of various chars suggested that the mineral matter left in the chars after coal devolatilization still had great contributions to the formation of ultrafine particles even during the char combustion stage. The concentration of PM10 from char combustion in oxy-firing was generally less than that in air-firing. The properties of the CO2-chars were different from those of the N2-chars, which was likely due to gasification reactions coal particles experienced during devolatilization in CO2 atmosphere. Regardless of the combustion modes, PM10 formation in combustion of N2-char and CO2-char from the same coal was found to be significantly dependent on char properties. The difference in the PM10 formation behavior between the N2-char and CO2-char was coal-type dependent.",

The apparent specific heat was determined during heating using an inverse calorimetric method (computer aided thermal analysis, CATA) and combined with pressure and displacement measurements to correlate endothermic and exothermic behaviour with measurement of swelling. The second technique used a post-oxidation stage to combust the tars and gases into products which were analysed. This method was used to study the elemental character of volatiles release from coal maceral concentrates in terms of carbon and hydrogen. Extents of swelling and exothermicity during primary devolatilisation were found to be correlated with vitrinite content and were associated with tar evolution. For the highest vitrinite fraction (of 86.4% vitrinite) swelling was initiated at the same temperature range for exothermic reactions, and maximum swelling coincided with the peak release of light gases. Tar evolution was found to change in chemical character (as defined by H/C ratio) during progressive heating, initially rising in the early stages of tar formation (<430\u00a0\u00b0C) to a maximum of 1.24, then gradually decreasing to a minimum of 0.64 at 550\u00a0\u00b0C.",

The detailed model of coal devolatilization, already developed and tested against a very large set of experiments and conditions, is too large to be implemented and used inside a CFD code.An automatic procedure is developed to estimate the kinetic parameters and stoichiometric coefficients of a one step model. An optimization technique manages to minimize an objective function which measures the distance between the simple one step kinetic mechanism and the results of the detailed model of coal volatilization. The results show that rate parameters can be expressed as function of the coal rank, or better of its carbon content. Despite its simplicity, the one step model is able to characterize not only the weight loss, but also the relative yields of gaseous species (CO, H2O, CO2, H2, C2H4, HCN, H2S), tar species and char. The coal database discussed in this work includes 13 coals of different elemental composition, from lignite to anthracite. The agreement of the one step model with the detailed model of coal volatilization is satisfactory for both evolution rates and cumulative values. Finally, it is important to newly underline that the proposed model, based on the detailed model, is predictive and only needs the coal elemental composition (coal rank) as an input. Two sets of correlation for the distribution of the nitrogen and sulfur compounds into solid, tar and gas phases are also proposed.",

     "abstract": "Reliable prediction of char conversion, heat release, and particle temperature during heterogeneous char oxidation relies upon quantitative calculation of the CO2/CO production ratio. This ratio depends strongly on the surface temperature, but also on the local partial pressure of oxygen and thus becomes more important in simulations of oxy-fuel or pressurized combustion systems. Existing semi-empirical intrinsic kinetic models of char combustion have been calibrated against the temperature-dependence of the CO2/CO production ratio, but have neglected the effect of the local oxygen concentration. In this study we employ steady-state analysis to demonstrate the limitations of the existing 3-step semi-global kinetics models and to show the necessity of using a 5-step model to adequately capture the temperature- and oxygen-dependence of the CO2/CO production ratio. A suitable 5-step heterogeneous reaction mechanism is developed and its rate parameters fit to match CO2/CO production data, global reaction orders, and activation energies reported in the literature. The model predictions are interrogated for a broad range of conditions characteristic of pressurized, oxy-fuel, and conventional high-temperature char combustion, for which essentially no experimental information on the CO2/CO production ratio is available. The results suggest that the CO2/CO production ratio may be considerably lower than that estimated with existing power-law correlations for oxygen partial pressures less than 10\u00a0kPa and surface temperatures higher than 1600\u00a0K. To assist with implementation of the mechanistic CO2/CO production ratio results, an analytical procedure for calculating the CO2/CO production ratio is presented.",

In addition, the radial distributions of the soot volume fraction were compared with the OH radical fluorescence, gas temperature and oxygen concentration obtained in our previous studies [1], [2]. The results indicated that the laser pulse fluence used for LII measurement should be carefully controlled to measure the soot volume fraction in pulverized coal flames. To precisely measure the soot volume fraction in pulverized coal flames using LII, it is necessary to adjust the laser pulse fluence so that it is sufficiently high to heat up all the soot particles to the sublimation temperature but also sufficiently low to avoid including a too large of a change in the morphology of the soot particles and the superposition of the LII signal from the pulverized coal particles on that from the soot particles. It was also found that the radial position of the peak LII signal intensity was located between the positions of the peak Mie scattering signal intensity and peak OH radical signal intensity. The region, in which LII signal, OH radical fluorescence and Mie scattering coexisted, expanded with increasing height above the burner port.

Finally, in combination with the boundary conditions the time-dependent scalar dissipation rate profiles from the resolved particle calculation are used in a flamelet calculation for the particle up- and downstream directions. Very good agreement is obtained in terms of ignition delay as well as temperature and chemical species distributions in the mixture fraction space when the resolved particle calculation and the unsteady flamelet calculation are compared in the downstream direction. Good agreement is obtained when the numerical results for the ignition time and the time-averaged OH distribution are compared with the available experimental data.

The model allows for changes in particle size due to burning at the external surface, changes in particle apparent density due to internal burning at pore walls, and changes in the sizes and apparent densities of particles due to percolation type fragmentation. In percolation type fragmentation, fragments of all sizes less than that of the fragmenting particle are produced. The model follows the conversion of particles burning in a gaseous environment of specified temperature and oxygen content. The extent of conversion and particle size, apparent density, and temperature distributions are predicted in time.Experiments were performed in an entrained flow reactor to obtain the size and apparent density data needed to adjust model parameters. Pulverized Wyodak coal particles were injected into the reactor and char samples were extracted at selected residence times. The particle size distributions and apparent densities were measured for each sample extracted. The intrinsic chemical reactivity of the char to oxygen was also measured in experiments performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer. Data were used to adjust rate coefficients in a six-step reaction mechanism used to describe the oxidation process.Calculations made allowing for fragmentation with variations in the apparent densities of fragments yield the type of size, apparent density, and temperature distributions observed experimentally. These distributions broaden with increased char conversion in a manner that can only be predicted when fragmentation is accounted for with variations in fragment apparent density as well as size.

Spontaneous ignition of coal dust deposited on a flat hot surface (1D case) and trapped between two hot surfaces (2D geometry), forming the shape of a wedge, is analyzed using lab-scale experiments and a mathematical model. The solution is obtained by assuming a temperature polynomial of third (one-dimensional) and fifth order (two-dimensional), in the energy conservation equation where the source term is defined using a 1-step Arrhenius type equation. The angle in wedge configuration is varied from 10\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 in steps of 10\u00b0. The results predicted by the mathematical model compare well with the trends shown by the experimental data. Consequent safety measures associated with dust layers trapped in corners or wedges are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Wildfires that spread into communities, commonly referred to as Wildland-Urban Interface fires (WUI), are a significant international problem. Post-fire damage studies have suggested for some time that firebrands are a significant cause of structure ignition in WUI fires, yet little research has been conducted to investigate firebrand production from burning vegetation and structures. To this end, firebrand production from real-scale building components under well-controlled laboratory conditions was investigated. Specifically, wall and re-entrant corner assemblies were ignited and during the combustion process, firebrands were collected to determine the size/mass distribution generated from such real-scale building components under varying wind speed. Finally, the size and mass distributions of firebrands collected in this study were compared with the data from an actual full-scale structure burn to determine if simple component tests such as these can provide insights into firebrand generation data from full-scale structures. The results are presented and discussed.",

     "abstract": "Piloted ignition of solid fuels is investigated by simulating the transport and chemical reaction in a counter-flow arrangement where a known fuel (methane) is supplied through a porous burner and the power and the location of the igniter are varied. The porous burner arrangement simulates a pyrolyzing solid fuel at constant temperature by separating the gas phase from the solid conduction and pyrolysis phenomena. An Arrhenius one-step global reaction and a simplified transport model with Lewis number equal to one were used in the simulation. Only quasi-steady conditions are considered for the gas phase in this work because the response time for the solid phenomena is, in general, much larger than the response diffusion time for the gaseous phenomena. The relation of piloted ignition to extinction is also investigated. The effect of Damk\u00f6hler number on ignition and extinction and the effect of the igniter on ignition are presented through a characteristic S curve obtained by plotting the evolving maximum temperature as a function of fuel mass flux. Based on the S-shaped curve (representing the maximum temperature in the system versus the mass flux of fuel), the relationship between the piloted ignition and extinction turning points and mass fluxes has been demonstrated in this paper. The piloted ignition turning point gradually approaches the extinction turning point with increasing Damk\u00f6hler number and also with increasing power of the igniter. The ignition mass flux is found to depend basically on three parameters, Damk\u00f6hler number, the location of the igniter and the power of the igniter all expressed in dimensionless forms.",

An ignition-to-spread model is developed to systematically explain ignition and the following transition to spread. The model predicts that for a higher-conductance wire it is more difficult to achieve ignition and the weak flame may extinguish during the transition phase because of a large conductive heat loss along the wire core. An experimental study was performed using several sample wires with different core metals, diameters and coating thicknesses of polyethylene. A coil heater was adopted as the ignition source, and both the heat flux and heating time were selected as the main parameters to identify the flashpoint and spread point of wire fires. Experiments show that additional heating times after flash are required in order to fully pass the transition and achieve a spreading flame, agreeing with model predictions. Finally, the effects of different heating lengths, environmental pressures, and oxygen concentration on wire ignition are discussed, which may be useful for upgrading the design and standards of future fire-safe wires.",

     "abstract": "One of the challenges in the experimental study of flame spread is that, even if the flame spreads at a steady rate, the propagating flame creates an unsteady phenomenon with respect to the laboratory frame of reference. As a result, only a few studies have been done where the detailed flame structure has been experimentally measured along with the spread rates. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of a new flame spread apparatus that moves the fuel in the opposite direction of the flame so as to keep the leading edge of the flame stationary with respect to the laboratory. A thermocouple, fixed to the laboratory frame of reference, in front of the leading edge of the flame, senses the presence of the flame and a PID controller keeps the set point temperature constant by moving the sample holder, driven by a stepper motor, in the opposite direction at the velocity of the spread. Unlike conventional studies, this apparatus, called the flame stabilizer, produces real time spread rate with a time resolution of 0.3\u00a0s. In this paper, instantaneous flame spread rate and the visible flame structure are compared between a downward spreading flame and the corresponding stabilized flame for spread over ashless filter paper. The results indicate that the difference between the two configurations are within experimental uncertainties and the stabilized flame can represent a spreading flame adequately, including variability of flame spread rate and the flame geometry, for further observations.",

Incident heat flux to a water-cooled gauge was measured at 1\u00a0cm intervals. At 6\u201315\u00a0cm above the bottom edge of the flame, the maximum heat flux value was found to be on the order of 35\u00a0kW\u00a0m\u22122.

Using these results and finely resolved measurements of sample burning rate recorded throughout the length of experiments, an analytical model that accurately predicts the measured heat flux profile along the vertical dimension of samples solely as a function of the burning rate was developed. Coupling this model with an accurate pyrolysis solver, which predicts material burning rate based on incident heat flux, is expected to enable highly accurate simulations of the flame spread dynamics.",

By performing experiments on 10\u00a0cm wide by 20\u00a0cm tall fuel samples it was found that the maximum flame-spread rate, occurring nearly in a vertical configuration, does not correspond to the maximum fuel mass-loss rate, which occurs closer to a horizontal configuration. A detailed study of both flame spread and steady burning at different angles of inclination revealed the influence of buoyancy-induced flows in modifying heat-flux profiles ahead of the flame front, which control flame spread, and in affecting the heat flux to the burning surface of the fuel, which controls fuel mass-loss rates.",

     "abstract": "The potential for oil exploration on the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf warrants determination of an efficient method to clean up an oil spill. Traditional spill response equipment may not be practical in an Arctic environment due to the presence of ice, which would act to prevent proper deployment of equipment. Additionally, the areas proposed for oil exploration lack the infrastructure and support networks necessary to stage a response to a large oil spill due to their remoteness. These difficulties make it necessary to explore alternative means of oil spill cleanup. In situ burning is one method that may be particularly well-suited for Arctic and sub-Arctic environments due to the minimal amount of equipment required to achieve an efficient burn, i.e. high mass loss. The Arctic and sub-Arctic environments add an additional level of complexity by introducing a spill medium (ice) that is highly unstable at elevated temperatures. Our experiments sought to calculate the mass loss rates of oil mixtures to determine the efficiency with which they burn within ice channels of varying widths. An average mass loss rate of 0.06\u00a0g/s was recorded which translates to efficiencies of 10%. The dominant factor contributing to low mass loss rates was the melting of the channel walls which resulted in the critical thickness of the oil to be reached sooner. Based on the findings, in situ burning would not be a viable means of oil spill cleanup. Instead, it may be preferred to use in situ burning in conjunction with mechanical cleanup techniques.",

Vertical samples (30\u00a0mm deep and 125\u00a0mm in diameter) are ignited by radiation on the top free surface and the smouldering front propagates downward against a forced flow of oxidizer. By varying the oxygen concentration ([O2]) and the ignition conditions we investigate the competing pyrolysis and oxidation reactions. A reaction framework with two regimes is consistently observed. The measurements show that a char species is formed by the competing pyrolysis and oxidation reactions in the first regime resulting in net char production and in the second regime char oxidation results in conversion of the char to ash. Lower mass loss rates and the larger residual mass at lower [O2] suggest that a wider smouldering front is required to sustain combustion as the [O2] is decreased. These results improve our understanding of smouldering phenomena and the role of the competing chemical reactions.",

A new concept termed fire layer is introduced and defined to characterize the spatial locations of fire points by which the complex spatial variations of burning rates, under different conditions, are analyzed and physically interpreted. Analysis shows that the fire layer burning rates vary from outer to inner in definite nonlinear modes. This indicates that the two fire interaction effects, heat feedback enhancement and air supply restriction, involve distinct spatial fluctuations in fire arrays. The spatial fluctuations of the two interaction effects are significantly affected by the two major parameters, fire spacing and fire array size. Definite spatial regions and parameter ranges for the spatial fluctuations and high competitions of the two interaction effects are clearly distinguished. It is demonstrated that the average burning rates of all fire layers involve consistent variations versus fire spacing or fire array size, especially with high comparability to the entire fire array. It is found that by varying fire spacing, the average burning rates for all fire layers vary linearly versus the fire area ratio, within the same ranges as the entire fire array, while there exist different fluctuation modes of fire layer burning rates with respect to fire array size. Furthermore, analysis shows that the burning rates of all fire layers will be significantly affected by fire merging when it occurs. Finally, a new approach is presented to simulate fire propagation among discrete fuel sources, by which the positive effect of the surrounding new fire points on the burning rates of the original ones is definitely indicated.",

The burners tested had the same fuel area of 900\u00a0cm2, but with aspect ratio of long side to short side (n\u00a0=\u00a0l/w) varied from 1 and 8. The individual and combined influences of low pressure and aspect ratio on burning rate, temperature, puffing frequency, flame height and radiation for the two fuels were interpreted and formulated. First, burning rate was found to be proportional to ambient air pressure under radiation control, the main reason is that radiative heat flux decreased with pressure due to the pressure affecting the soot absorption coefficient. Flame temperature slightly increased, leading to higher flame puffing frequency at low pressure. Flame height was almost insensitive to pressure as H \u221d p 0 . Second, for aspect ratio n, flame temperature was constant and independent of fuel type and burner shape. With increasing n, burner wall temperature increased at the long side, and decreased drastically at the short side, especially n\u00a0=\u00a08. This was attributed to the change of flame tilt and heating of the burner side, caused by variation of entrainment motion. Flame puffing frequency was found to increase with n as a function of f \u223c ( \u0394 T / T \u221e ) ( n + 1 ) / 2 n . The flame was observed to split into small clusters by enhanced asymmetric entrainment, and H decreased with increasing n as H \u223c ( 1 / n ) 2 / 5 Q \u02d9 4 / 15 .

The behavior of the flame height under low gravity did not correlate to the scaling prediction previously presented, while the normal velocity component to the flame sheet declined with decreasing gravity.

The experimental medium-scale fire whirls were produced by a fixed-frame facility. Experimental observations indicate that flame revolution is an important flame instability during the formation of fire whirl, showing that the entire flame is inclined and revolves around the geometrical axis of symmetry with increasing angular velocity until the critical point, without the self-rotation of the flame. It is found that the inlet velocity fluctuates synchronously with the flame revolution. As soon as the fire whirl forms, the erect swirling flame starts to precess around the geometrical axis of symmetry. Analysis indicates that during flame precession the periodic fluctuations of inlet velocity disappear and a local annular external recirculation zone (ERZ) is produced outside the flame (vortex core), while the flow is upward inside. It is found that the inlet velocities are nearly constant within the continuous flame in order to maintain a stable generating eddy. A good linear correlation exists between the average inlet velocities and average ambient circulations for all fuel pan sizes. The precession frequency is relatively stable during one test. The frequencies of flame revolution and precession are both proportional to the average inlet velocity, and the corresponding Strouhal numbers are constants of 0.42 and 0.80, respectively. The flame revolves and precesses in the same direction as the self-rotation of the fire whirl flame in all tests. The flame revolution is related to the periodical fluctuations of inlet flow, while the flame precession is considered to be linked to the occurrence of ERZ in fire whirls.",

     "abstract": "In this paper, the effect of flow circulation on the combustion dynamics of fire whirl is systematically investigated by experiments. New correlations for the burning rate, flame height, radial temperature and mass flow rate are established for fire whirl. It is clarified that flow circulation helps increase both the fuel-flame contact area and the actual fuel surface area, which in turn increases both the heat feedback to the fuel surface and the radial velocity in the ground boundary layer, leading to increase of burning rate. A novel idea for correlation of fire whirl flame height is proposed by assuming that the ratio of the fire whirl flame height to the flame height without circulation solely characterizes the effect of circulation. This idea is fully verified, thereby a new formulation for flame height is established, which successfully decouples the burning rate and the circulation. It is indicated that the fuel-rich core in the flame body of fire whirl significantly affects the radial temperature distribution in the continuous flame region, and the flame body can be described by the combination of a cylinder and a cone. The flow circulation significantly suppresses fire plume radius and thus decreases its increasing rate with vertical distance. It is also demonstrated that the fire whirl flame involves laminarized regions in its lower section, coexisting with turbulent regions in the upper portion. The flow circulation enhances the air entrainment in the ground layer by altering the radial velocity profile and increasing the radial velocity. In the low section of flaming region, the significant decrease of mixture between the combustion products and surrounding air dominates the pure aerodynamic effect of flow circulation on the flame height. Finally, it is clarified that fire whirls maintain higher centerline excess temperature than general pool fires due to the effect of less air entrainment.",

Data assimilation is an efficient strategy, initially developed for meteorological applications, that integrates sensor observations with computational models, accounts for observation and modeling errors, and thereby provides optimal estimates of poorly known variables and improved predictions of complex systems dynamics. In the present study, the effective wildfire rate of spread is calibrated using: measurements of the time-evolving fire front position; a level-set-based fire propagation solver with a description of the local rate of spread based on Rothermel\u2019s model; and a simplified Kalman Filter algorithm. The prototype data-driven wildfire simulation capability is first evaluated in academic tests using synthetically-generated observations; the prototype capability is then evaluated in a more realistic validation test corresponding to a controlled grassland fire experiment. The results indicate that data assimilation has the potential of dramatically increasing fire simulation accuracy.",

Typically, the assumption made is that the balance between aerodynamic forces and weight defines the characteristic size of lofted brands. This work develops a model for predicting the size distribution of brands lofted from a fractal tree using simple mechanical breakage models that are coupled to a simple thermal decomposition model. The breakage model is parameterized by fuel density and strength data that are experimentally generated. Dimensionless parameters are identified to characterize the degradation and breakage processes. The breakage model is then coupled to a plume model to form a description of the breakage, transport, and mass loss of branching vegetative fuel packets in wildland fire scenarios. A Monte Carlo simulation is then performed for branching fuels in a wildland fire case study, and the presence of an optimal branch diameter for mass transport by brand lofting is identified.",

     "abstract": "Tests with flames spreading over wire insulation in microgravity were performed at varying external opposed flow conditions to examine the influence of flow velocity in the time dependent volume change of molten insulation. In the experiments, low density polyethylene insulated Nickel\u2013chrome wire specimens were used and the oxygen concentration was fixed at 30% (N2 balanced). The results show that the time dependent changes in molten insulation volume are related to the opposed flow velocity. Further, as opposed flow velocity increases, the volume change rate decreases monotonically. By subtracting the volume change rate from the volume supply rate from the solid part to the molten part, which is calculated by multiplying the rate of spreading of molten insulation at the leading edge by the cross sectional area of the insulation, a pyrolysis volume rate for the polyethylene was established. The pyrolysis volume rate is defined as the amount of consumed molten insulation volume per unit time. After these calculations, it was found that the pyrolysis volume rate increases monotonically with increases in the opposed flow velocity. Further, numerical calculations of time dependent volume change in the molten insulation at different flow velocities were made. The numerical results show good agreement with the experimental results of the molten insulation volume change during the 0\u20134.5\u00a0s of microgravity measured here. By using the numerical calculations for this initial short period, the time dependent volume change in molten insulation during longer-term microgravity is predicted. The calculated results show that the volume finally reaches a steady state value in flow velocities of 10\u2013250\u00a0mm/s investigated here. These results provide insight into the mechanism of flame spreading over wire insulation, especially the unsteadiness of the flame in flame spreading events.",

Microgravity experiments were conducted in 100\u00a0m and 50\u00a0m drop towers and calculations were carried out with a one dimensional cylindrical coordinate system. The experimental results showed that the limiting oxygen concentration (LOC) under a given electric current was much lower in microgravity than that in normal gravity except for extremely large electric current overload cases. According to the calculations, the supplied electric current, the Joule energy supplied to the wire, determined the amount of pyrolysis gas from the insulation and the resulting thickness of the gaseous fuel layer around the sample in gas phase increased. The increased fuel layer thickness resulted in a longer ignition delay, which leads to lower LOC. The changes in the estimated LOC changed as a function of supplied energy and agreed well with the experimental results. Further, the minimum ignition energy causing ignition (ignition limit) is nearly constant under a constant oxygen concentration, which supports experimental findings in previous research.",

For comparison simulations have also been carried out for normal gravity (1ge) downward spreading flames. G-jitter is emulated by gravity modulation of sinusoidal (Age\u00a0sin(2\u03c0t/Tge)) gravity perturbation (g-perturbation) of a particular time-period (Tge) and amplitude (Age) over a selected base gravity level (0ge or 1ge). The response of flames at 0ge base gravity and at 1ge base gravity was different to the imposed g-perturbation. While at 0ge the mean and the amplitude of the oscillatory flame spread rate (FSR) magnified with increase in the time period of g-perturbation, interestingly for the 1ge flame a maximum mean FSR and oscillation amplitude occurs at certain perturbation time period. Further, at very small perturbation time-periods (Tge) the FSR at 1ge was lower than the steady state FSR. The amplitude of oscillatory FSR increased with increase in perturbation amplitude (Age). However, the 0ge flame which is little affected (compared to 1ge flame) at small perturbation amplitude (Age) is affected severely at large perturbation amplitude (Age). Both the gas phase and fuel pyrolysis (or fuel response) follow perturbation signal with a lag but fuel pyrolysis is more sluggish and lags behind gas phase. The phase lag between fuel pyrolysis and gas increases at smaller time-periods (Tge) and tends to enhance the effect of external perturbation whereas at larger time-periods (Tge) this lag inhibits the effect of external perturbation.",

In a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) performance test simulating the explosion of an aerosol can, however, the replacements, when added at sub-inerting concentrations, have all been found to create higher pressure rise than with no agent, hence failing the test. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations as well as perfectly-stirred reactor (PSR) simulations with detailed reaction kinetics, are performed for one of these agents, C6F12O (Novec 1230), to understand the reasons for the unexpected enhanced combustion rather than suppression. The high pressure rise with added agent is shown to depend on the amount of agent, and can only occur if a large fraction of the available oxidizer in the chamber is consumed, corresponding to stoichiometric proportions of fuel, oxygen, and agent. A kinetic model for the reaction of C6F12O in hydrocarbon\u2013air flames has been developed. Stirred-reactor simulations predict that at higher agent loadings, the inhibition effectiveness of C6F12O is relatively insensitive to the overall stoichiometry, and the marginal inhibitory effect of the agent is greatly reduced, so that the mixture remains flammable over a wide range of conditions corresponding to those of the FAA test. The present findings are consistent with and support the earlier analyses for C2HF5 and CF3Br, which were also evaluated in the FAA test.",

In this work, experiments were conducted to study the effect of oxygen concentration, external radiant flux and oxidizer flow velocity on the concurrent flame spread over two FR fabrics: Nomex HT90-40 and a Nomex/Nylon/Cotton fabric blend. Results show that for a given fabric the minimum oxygen concentration for concurrent flame spread depends strongly on the magnitude of the external radiant flux. At increased oxygen concentrations the external radiant flux required for flame spread decreases. Oxidizer flow velocity influences the external radiant flux only when the convective heat flux from the flame has similar values to the external radiant flux.

Propane and a propane\u2013ethanol\u2013water fuel mixture, prescribed for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aerosol can explosion simulator test, were used as the fuel. The time-dependent, two-dimensional numerical code, which includes a detailed kinetic model (177 species and 2986 reactions), diffusive transport, and a gray-gas radiation model, revealed unique flame structure and predicted the minimum extinguishing concentration of agent when added to the air stream. The peak reactivity spot (i.e., reaction kernel) at the flame base stabilized a trailing flame. The calculated flame temperature along the trailing flame decreased downstream due to radiative cooling, causing local extinction at <1250\u00a0K and flame tip opening. As the mole fraction of agent in the coflow (Xa) was increased gradually: (1) the premixed-like reaction kernel weakened (i.e., lower heat release rate) (but nonetheless formed at higher temperature); (2) the flame base stabilized increasingly higher above the burner rim, parallel to the axis, until finally blowoff-type extinguishment occurred; (3) the calculated maximum flame temperature remained at nearly constant (\u22481700\u00a0K) or mildly increased; and (4) the total heat release of the entire flame decreased (inhibited) for CF3Br but increased (enhanced) for C2HF5. In the lifted flame base with added C2HF5, H2O (formed from hydrocarbon-O2 combustion) was converted further to HF and CF2O through exothermic reactions, thus enhancing the heat-release rate peak. In the trailing flame, \u201ctwo-zone\u201d flame structure developed: CO2 and CF2O were formed primarily in the inner and outer zones, respectively, while HF was formed in both zones. As a result, the unusual (non-chain branching) reactions and the combustion enhancement (increased total heat release) due to the C2HF5 addition occurred primarily in the trailing diffusion flame.",

     "abstract": "In the present study, extinguishment of propane/air co-flowing diffusion flame by fine water droplets was investigated experimentally. Water droplets are generated by piezoelectric atomizers with the maximum droplets flow rate of 1500\u00a0ml/h. When the fuel injection velocity Uf is low, an attached laminar diffusion flame with a premixed flame at the base is stabilized. At some distance from the burner rim, a transition from laminar to turbulent diffusion flame occurs, and a turbulent diffusion flame is formed in the downstream region. When the fuel injector rim is thin (\u03b4\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0mm), the flame stability deteriorates with increase of the co-flowing air stream velocity Ua and the water droplets flow rate Qm. The stability mechanism can be explained by the balance of the gas velocity and the burning velocity of premixed flame formed at the base. However, when the injector rim is thick (\u03b4\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0mm), a recirculation zone is produced downstream of the injector rim. The dependence of the quenching distance Hq on Uf and Qm is relatively weak, and the stability diagram shows curious features. It was shown that Ua is crucially important since it determines flow residence time; if Ua\u00a0<\u00a00.4\u00a0m/s, water droplets can evaporate when they go by the recirculation zone, and the water vapor can diffuse into the recirculation zone. However, if Ua\u00a0>\u00a00.4\u00a0m/s, the water droplets should pass by the recirculation zone without sufficiently evaporated and are not so effective to extinguish the flame. The supply velocity of droplet-laden air should be low enough so that water droplets can evaporate and water vapor can diffuse into the premixed region at the base to obtain sufficient effectiveness of water droplets for fire suppression.",

Primary fragmentation tests showed that for wood pellets limited fragmentation occurred during devolatilization, with a fragmentation probability around 30% and particle multiplication factor of 1.4. On the contrary, wood chips were subject to extensive fragmentation as witnessed by large values of the particle multiplication factor and of the fragmentation probability.Results of char attrition experiments carried out under inert, combustion and gasification conditions showed that the carbon loss by elutriation is critical only during gasification, especially for the wood chips char. A gasification-assisted attrition mechanism was proposed to explain the experimental results, similar to the well known combustion-assisted attrition patterns already documented for coal under oxidizing conditions. The higher mechanical strength of the wood pellets appears to be beneficial for reducing carbon elutriation and for obtaining a higher carbon conversion.",

     "abstract": "Crude glycerol is an abundant by-product of biodiesel production. As volumes of this potential waste grow, there is increasing interest in developing new value added uses. One possible use, as a boiler fuel for process heating, offers added advantages of energy integration and fossil fuel substitution. However, challenges to the use of crude glycerol as a boiler fuel include its low energy density, high viscosity, and high autoignition temperature. We have previously shown that a refractory-lined, high swirl burner can overcome challenges related to flame ignition and stability. However, critical issues related to ash behavior and the possible formation of acrolein remained. The work presented here indicates that the presence of dissolved catalysts used during the esterification and transesterification processes results in extremely large amounts of inorganic species in the crude glycerol. For the fuels examined here, the result is a submicron fly ash comprised primarily of sodium carbonates, phosphates, and sulfates. These particles report to a well-developed accumulation mode (0.3\u20130.7\u00a0\u03bcm diameter), indicating extensive ash vaporization and particle formation via nucleation, condensation, and coagulation. Particle mass emissions were between 2 and 4\u00a0g/m3. These results indicate that glycerol containing soluble catalyst is not suitable as a boiler fuel. Fortunately, process improvements are currently addressing this issue. Additionally, acrolein is of concern due to its toxicity, and is known to be formed from the low temperature thermal decomposition of glycerol. Currently, there is no known reliable method for measuring acrolein in sources. Acrolein and emissions of other volatile organic compounds were characterized through the use of a SUMMA canister-based sampling method followed by GC\u2013MS analysis designed for ambient measurements. Results indicate crude glycerol combustion produces relatively small amounts of acrolein (\u223c15\u00a0ppbv) and other volatile organic compounds, with emissions comparable to those from natural gas combustion.",

The principal challenges are posed by the small scales, the many chemical species involved in hydrocarbon combustion, and the coupled processes of reaction and molecular diffusion in a turbulent flow field. These challenges, and how different modeling approaches face them, are examined from the viewpoint of low-dimensional manifolds in the high-dimensional space of chemical species. Most current approaches to modeling turbulent combustion can be categorized as flamelet-like or PDF-like. The former assume or imply that the compositions occurring in turbulent combustion lie on very-low-dimensional manifolds, and that the coupling between turbulent mixing and reaction can be parameterized by at most one or two variables. PDF-like models do not restrict compositions in this way, and they have proved successful in describing more challenging combustion regimes in which there is significant local extinction, or in which the turbulence significantly disrupts flamelet structures. Advances in diagnostics, the design of experiments, computational resources, and direct numerical simulations are all contributing to the continuing development of more accurate and general models of turbulent combustion.",

These mechanisms may comprise of up to hundreds of species and thousands of reactions with thermo-kinetic data derived from a wide variety of sources including direct measurements, global combustion experiments, and theoretical calculations. However, significant uncertainties in the data used to parametrise combustion models still exist. These input uncertainties propagate through models of combustion devices leading to uncertainties in the prediction of key combustion properties.

This approach determines the predicted distributions of the phenomenological rate coefficients based on a quasi-random sample of the fundamental parameters within their uncertainty range. Sensitivity analysis then identifies the main parameters which contribute to variance in the predicted distributions. Here the approach is applied to a study of the oxidation of the propyl radical, employing the parameters derived in our recent theoretical study. We find rates at 3\u03c3 variances that typically differ from the most frequent values by factors of 4\u20136, with the uncertainties decreasing with increasing temperature. For the well skipping reactions there are more parameters that contribute significantly to the variance, the second-order sensitivities are greater, and the uncertainties increased with increasing pressure. For the other reactions, the uncertainties tend to decrease with increasing pressure.",

     "abstract": "Currently, most detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms for combustion are still not comprehensive enough and update of key reaction rate is still required to improve the combustion mechanisms. The development of systematic mechanism reduction methods have made significant progress, and have greatly facilitated analysis of the reaction mechanisms and identification of important species and key reactions. In the present work, time-integrated element flux analysis is employed to analyze a skeletal combustion mechanism of a tri-component kerosene surrogate mixture, consisting of n-decane, n-propylcyclohexane, and n-propylbenzene. The results of element flux analysis indicate that major reaction pathways for each component in the surrogate model are captured by the skeletal mechanism compared with the detailed mechanism. After that, sensitivity analysis (SA) and chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) are conducted to identify the dominant ignition chemistry. The SA and CEMA results demonstrate that the ignition of n-decane and n-propylcyclohexane is sensitive only to the oxidation chemistry of H2/CO and C1\u2013C4 small hydrocarbons, while the ignition of n-propylbenzene is very sensitive to the initial reactions of n-propylbenzene and related aromatic intermediates. This demonstrates that the hierarchic structure should be maintained in the reduction of detailed mechanism of substituted aromatic fuels. The skeletal mechanism is further reduced by combining the computational singular perturbation (CSP) method and quasi steady state approximation (QSSA). A 34-species global reduced mechanism is obtained and validated over a wide range of parameters for ignition.",

H2/O2/N2 combustion system is considered in a non-premixed counter-flow diffusion 1D flame configuration. This study shows how the REDIM concept performs in the transient regimes; it interprets the effect of local extinction and reigniting phenomena using detailed and reduced models.

     "abstract": "Simulations of turbulent reacting flows with chemistry represented using detailed kinetic model involving a large number of species and reactions are computationally expensive. Here we present a combined dimension reduction and tabulation strategy for implementing chemistry in large scale parallel Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)/Probability Density Function (PDF) computations of turbulent reacting flows. In this approach, the dimension reduction is performed using the Rate Controlled Constrained-Equilibrium (RCCE) method, and tabulation of the reduced space is performed using the In Situ Adaptive Tabulation (ISAT) algorithm. In addition, we use x2f_mpi \u2014 a Fortran library for parallel vector-valued function evaluation (used with ISAT in this context) \u2014 to efficiently redistribute the chemistry workload among the participating cores in parallel LES/PDF computations to reduce the overall wall clock time of the simulation. We test three parallel strategies for redistributing the chemistry workload, namely (a) PLP, purely local processing; (b) URAN, the uniform random distribution of chemistry computations among all cores following an early stage of PLP; and (c) P-URAN, a Partitioned URAN strategy that redistributes the workload within partitions or subsets of the cores. To demonstrate the efficiency of this combined approach, we perform parallel LES/PDF computations (on 1024 cores) of the Sandia Flame D with chemistry represented using a 38-species C1\u2013C4 skeletal mechanism. We show that relative to using ISAT alone with the 38-species full representation, the combined ISAT/RCCE approach with 10 represented species (i) predicts time-averaged mean and standard deviation statistics with a normalized root-mean-square difference of less than 3% (30\u00a0K) in temperature, less than 2% (0.02\u00a0kg/m3) in density, less than 2.5% in mass fraction of major species, and less than 8% in mass fraction of minor species of interest; and (ii) reduces the simulation wall clock time by over 40% with the P-URAN strategy.",

     "abstract": "The efficient simulation of technical combustion processes requires a reduced description of the thermochemical state. Especially in the case of turbulent combustion, appropriate reduction methods are required to save computational costs, while preserving a desired accuracy. The current work deals with the application of the so-called reaction-diffusion manifold (REDIM) method. It is used to identify a two-dimensional manifold in the composition space, describing the thermochemical states of an unconfined, lean premixed, piloted, turbulent methane/air flame. This stratified flame is an interesting case, because it coveres different flamelet regimes, namly premixed flamelets and premixed flamelets mixing with air, which complicates the application of flamelet methods. Although the REDIM method is not restricted to a specific flamelet regime, previous works dealt either with premixed or diffusion flames. Thus in the current work, the application of the REDIM method is extended to an intermediate flamelet regime. The application of the method is demonstrated step by step, which includes the detailed description of determining an initial manifold and of estimating gradients. Eventually a two-dimensional manifold for a physically motivated gradient estimation is presented and analyzed by a comparison to detailed flamelet trajectories. The discussion shows, that the manifold accounts for important premixed and diffusion scenarios of the turbulent flame. Therefore the REDIM can be used in subsequent CFD simulations, which is not part of the current work.",

The 2-methylphenyl radical may undergo a facile isomerization to benzyl through a four-membered ring critical structure \u2013 a pathway not accessible to 3- and 4-methylphenyl.

Shock tube and rapid compression machine ignition delay time measurements are reported over a wide range of conditions of relevance to combustion engine applications: temperatures from 678 to 1356\u00a0K; pressures of 6.5, 10, 20, and 50\u00a0atm; and equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. The wide range of temperatures examined provides observation of autoignition in three reactivity regimes, including the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime characteristic of paraffinic fuels. Comparisons made between the current ignition delay measurements for 3-methylheptane and previous results for n-octane and 2-methylheptane quantifies the influence of a single methyl substitution and its location on the reactivity of alkanes. It is found that the three C8 alkane isomers have indistinguishable high-temperature ignition delay but their ignition delay times deviate in the NTC and low-temperature regimes in correlation with their research octane numbers. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a proposed kinetic model that includes both high- and low-temperature oxidation chemistry. The model mechanistically explains the differences in reactivity for n-octane, 2-methylheptane, and 3-methylheptane in the NTC through the influence of the methyl substitution on the rates of isomerization reactions in the low-temperature chain branching pathway, that ultimately leads to ketohydroperoxide species, and the competition between low-temperature chain branching and the formation of cyclic ethers, in a chain propagating pathway.",

     "abstract": "The analysis and interpretation of the combustion chemistry is greatly simplified by using simple mixtures of pure components, referred to as surrogates, in lieu of fully-blended transportation fuels, such as gasoline. Recognizing that the ability to model autoignition chemistry is critical to understanding the operation of Homogeneous Charged Compression Ignition engines, this work is an attempt to experimentally and computationally assess the autoignition responses of research grade gasoline and two of its proposed surrogates reported in the literature using a rapid compression machine (RCM), for the low-to-intermediate temperature range and at high pressures. The first surrogate studied is a three-component mixture of iso-octane, n-heptane, and toluene. The second is a four-component mixture that includes an olefin (2-pentene), in addition to the ones noted above. Ignition delay times of stoichiometric mixtures, for gasoline and the two surrogates in air, are measured using an RCM for pressures of 20 and 40\u00a0bar, and in the temperature range of 650\u2013900\u00a0K. The four-component surrogate is found to emulate the ignition delay times of gasoline more closely when compared to the three-component surrogate. Additionally, the experimental data are compared against the computed results from a recently developed surrogate model for gasoline combustion. A good agreement between the experimental and computed results is observed, while discrepancies are also identified and discussed.",

Concentration time-histories were recorded for five species: C2H4, CH4, OH, CO2, and H2O. Methane was monitored using DFG laser absorption near 3.4\u00a0\u03bcm; OH was monitored using UV laser absorption at 306.5\u00a0nm; C2H4 was monitored using a CO2 gas laser at 10.5\u00a0\u03bcm; and CO2 and H2O were monitored using tunable DFB diode laser absorption at 2.7 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively.

Comparisons were made with the predictions of two diesel-surrogate reaction mechanisms (Westbrook et al. [1]; Ranzi et al.

Comparisons of the intermediate product yields of ethylene for n-hexadecane with those found for other smaller n-alkanes, show that an n-hexadecane mechanism derived from a simple hierarchical extrapolation from a smaller n-alkane mechanism does not properly simulate the experimental measurements.",

These experiments probed the time-resolved formation of products following photolytic initiation of the oxidation, and identify isomeric species by their photoionization spectra. The relative yields of oxygenated product isomers (2,2-dimethyloxirane, methylpropanal, and 3-methyloxetane) are in reasonable concord with measurements from Walker and co-workers (J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 74 (1) (1978) 2229\u20132251) at higher temperature. Oxidation of isotopically labeled isobutane, (CH3)3CD, suggests that methylpropanal formation can proceed from both (CH3)2CCH2OOH and CH3CH(CH2)CH2OOH isomers. Bimodal time behavior is observed for product formation; the initial prompt formation reflects \u201cformally direct\u201d channels, principally chemical activation, and the longer-timescale \u201cdelayed\u201d component arises from dissociation of thermalized ROO and QOOH radicals. The proportion of prompt to delayed signal is smaller for the oxygenated products than for the isobutene product. This channel-specific behavior can be qualitatively understood by considering the different energetic distributions of ROO and QOOH in formally direct vs. thermal channels and the fact that the transition states involved in the formation of oxygenated products are \u201ctighter\u201d than that for isobutene formation.",

The results were compared to ignition delay times of primary reference fuels under identical conditions. A detailed kinetics model is proposed for the ignition of all fuel mixtures. The model predicts well the ignition delay times for pure 3-pentanone for a wide range of pressure and temperature and equivalence ratios in argon dilution as well as in air. Ignition delay times for 3-pentanone-doped mixtures, especially in the low-temperature range are overpredicted by approx. a factor of 0.5 (at 800\u00a0K, 40\u00a0bar, \u03d5\u00a0=\u00a01.0) by the calculation but the model still reproduces the overall trend of the experimental data. For lean conditions, 10% 3-pentanone reduces the reactivity of n-Heptane below 1000\u00a0K while for stoichiometric conditions it does not alter the ignition delay by more than 11% at 850\u00a0K and 20\u00a0bar. In iso-octane the effect is inverse, leading to acceleration of the main ignition.

The aerosol shock tube enabled study of these very-low-vapor-pressure fuels by introducing a spatially-uniform fuel aerosol/4% oxygen/argon mixture into the shock tube and employing the incident shock wave to produce complete fuel evaporation, diffusion, and mixing. Reflected shock conditions covered temperatures from 1100 to 1400\u00a0K, pressures of 3.5 and 7.0\u00a0atm, and equivalence ratios from 0.6 to 2.4. Ignition delay times for both fuels were found to be similar over a wide range of conditions. The most notable trend in the observed ignition delay times was that the pressure and equivalence ratio scaling were a strong function of temperature, and exhibited cross-over temperatures at which there was no sensitivity to either parameter. Data were also compared to the biodiesel kinetic mechanism of Westbrook et al. (2011) [10], which underpredicts ignition delay times by about 50%. Differences between experimental and computed ignition delay times were strongly related to existing errors and uncertainties in the thermochemistry of the large methyl ester species, and when these were corrected, the kinetic simulations agreed significantly better with the experimental measurements.",

The lumped model is the natural extension of the kinetic scheme of methyl butanoate and methyl decanoate and takes also a great advantage from the detailed kinetic scheme of biodiesel fuels [Westbrook et al. Combustion and Flame 158 (2011) 742\u2013755]. The combustion of methyl palmitate and methyl stearate is very similar to the one of methyl decanoate, while large unsaturated methyl esters are significantly less reactive at low and intermediate temperatures. The formation of resonantly stabilized allylic radicals from unsaturated methyl esters constitutes a critical element very useful to characterize the reactivity of the different fuels. The extension of the previous kinetic model of hydrocarbon and oxygenated fuel combustion to the methyl esters required the introduction of \u223c60 lumped species and \u223c2000 reactions. The dimension of the overall kinetic scheme (\u223c420 species involved in \u223c13,000 reactions) allows a more flexible and direct application of the model without the need of kinetic reductions. The comparison of model predictions and different sets of experimental data from one side allows to verify the reliability of the proposed model, from the other side calls for further experimental and theoretical work on this subject.",

Measurements were then extended to include two ternary blends of the fuels using 5% and 20% (vol.) of the methyl ester under stoichiometric conditions. Using three independently validated chemical kinetics mechanisms, a model was compiled to assess the influence of methyl ester concentration on ignition delay times of the ternary blends. Under near-atmospheric pressure, ignition delay times were of the following order for the pure fuels: methyl octanoate\u00a0<\u00a0n-nonane\u00a0<\u00a0methylcyclohexane. Experimental results indicate that the ignition behavior of the higher-order methyl ester approaches that of the higher-order linear alkane with increased pressure regardless of equivalence ratio. Methyl octanoate also displayed significantly lower pressure dependence relative to the linear alkane and the cycloalkane species. Both of these results are supported by model calculations. Blending of methyl octanoate with n-nonane and methylcyclohexane impacted ignition delay time results more strongly at 1.5\u00a0atm, yet had only a small effect near 10\u00a0atm for temperatures above 1400\u00a0K.

     "abstract": "The kinetics of the C6H5 reactions with CH3OH and C2H5OH has been measured by pulsed-laser photolysis/mass-spectrometry (PLP/MS) employing acetophenone as the radical source. Kinetic modeling of the benzene formed in the reactions over the temperature range 306\u2013771\u00a0K allows us to reliably determine the total rate constants for H-abstraction reactions. In order to improve our low temperature measurements down to 304\u00a0K we have also applied the cavity ring-down spectrometric technique using nitrosobenzene as the radical source. Both sets of data agree closely. A weighted least-squares analysis of the two complementary sets of data for the two reactions gave the total rate constants k(CH3OH)\u00a0=\u00a0(7.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.44)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01011\u00a0exp [\u2212(853\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030)/T] and k(C2H5OH)\u00a0=\u00a0(5.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01011\u00a0exp [\u2212(1103\u00a0\u00b1\u00a044)/T]\u00a0cm3\u00a0mol\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 for the temperature range studied.

The hydrogen abstraction channels were predicted to have lower energy barriers than those for the substitution reactions and their rate constants were calculated by the microcanonical variational transition state theory at 200\u20133000\u00a0K. The predicted rate constants are in good agreement with the experimental values. Significantly, the rate constant for the CH3OH reaction with C6H5 was found to be greater than that for the C2H5OH reaction and both reactions were found computationally to be dominated by H-abstraction from the hydroxyl group attributable to the affinity of the phenyl toward the OH group and the predicted lower energy barriers for the OH attack.",

     "abstract": "Butanol isomers are promising next-generation biofuels. Their use in internal combustion applications, especially those relying on low-temperature autoignition, requires an understanding of their low-temperature combustion chemistry. Whereas the high-temperature oxidation chemistry of all four butanol isomers has been the subject of substantial experimental and theoretical efforts, their low-temperature oxidation chemistry remains underexplored. In this work we report an experimental study on the fundamental low-temperature oxidation chemistry of two butanol isomers, tert-butanol and isobutanol, in low-pressure (4\u20135.1\u00a0Torr) experiments at 550 and 700\u00a0K. We use pulsed-photolytic chlorine atom initiation to generate hydroxyalkyl radicals derived from tert-butanol and isobutanol, and probe the chemistry of these radicals in the presence of an excess of O2 by multiplexed time-resolved tunable synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry. Isomer-resolved yields of stable products are determined, providing insight into the chemistry of the different hydroxyalkyl radicals. In isobutanol oxidation, we find that the reaction of the \u03b1-hydroxyalkyl radical with O2 is predominantly linked to chain-terminating formation of HO2. The Waddington mechanism, associated with chain-propagating formation of OH, is the main product channel in the reactions of O2 with \u03b2-hydroxyalkyl radicals derived from both tert-butanol and isobutanol. In the tert-butanol case, direct HO2 elimination is not possible in the \u03b2-hydroxyalkyl\u00a0+\u00a0O2 reaction because of the absence of a beta C\u2013H bond; this channel is available in the \u03b2-hydroxyalkyl\u00a0+\u00a0O2 reaction for isobutanol, but we find that it is strongly suppressed. Observed evolution of the main products from 550 to 700\u00a0K can be qualitatively explained by an increasing role of hydroxyalkyl radical decomposition at 700\u00a0K.",

A detailed comparison of the ignition behaviour of C4\u2013C10 n-alkanes and C4\u2013C6 n-alcohols shows the general trends and influence of the alcohol group. While for the alcohol fuels the reactivity is increased at high temperatures it is decreased for low temperatures in comparison to the alkanes. Furthermore, the influence of the alcohol group at lower temperatures seems to decrease for longer carbon chains so that a negligible influence of the alcohol group can be expected for very long carbon chains.",

     "abstract": "Unsaturated hydrocarbons are an important component of hydrocarbon fuels and intermediates in their oxidation. Under rich conditions, H atom attack is one of the principal pathways of the decomposition of these unsaturated compounds. Consequently, it is critical to understand the H atom attack mechanisms as part of chemical model development. Previous studies have examined the kinetics of H atom attack on various unsaturated hydrocarbons in single pulse shock-tubes. These studies have noted that there are multiple pathways by which H atom attack can proceed, so it is straightforward to measure relative rates but absolute rates are more difficult to estimate. In addition, there is a confounding influence from secondary chemistry. A multiparameter optimization and uncertainty minimization technique is used to constrain a chemical model for the oxidation of H2/CO/C1\u2013C4 hydrocarbons against a range of measurements of the H atom attack process on toluene, trimethylbenzene (TMB), propyne, and propene.

The results represent the first direct study of the alkene product branching ratio resulting from the kinetics of the competition between isomerization and beta C\u2013C bond scission for a secondary straight-chain alkyl radical at high temperatures. Such species are representative of intermediates important in the combustion of typical hydrocarbon fuels. In the present work, a small quantity of precursor (\u223c45\u00a0\u03bcL/L) is used to thermally generate H atoms in the presence of excess (E)-2-pentene, leading to the radicals of interest via addition of H to the double bond. Decomposition of the chemically activated pentyl radicals results in the stable olefin products ethene, propene, and 1-butene, which are detected in postshock gas chromatographic analyses utilizing flame-ionization and mass-spectrometric detection. It is shown that the olefin product ratios can be related to the isomerization and decomposition reactions of the 2-pentyl and 3-pentyl radicals and the results are consistent with the existence of distinct non-overlapping cracking patterns for the two radicals. The data are compared with predictions made on the basis of a model developed from experiments on the decomposition of thermal (i.e. not chemically activated) 1-pentyl radicals. Good agreement is observed. In conjunction with an RRKM/Master Equation analysis, the results for 2-pentyl and 3-pentyl radicals are projected over a wide range of temperatures.

In order to integrate information from distinct data types in a self-consistent manner, a framework for combustion model development is presented that encapsulates behavior across a wide range of chemically relevant scales from fundamental molecular interactions to global combustion phenomena. The resulting kinetic model consists of a set of theoretical kinetics parameters (with constrained uncertainties), which are related through kinetics calculations to temperature/pressure/bath-gas-dependent rate constants (with propagated uncertainties), which in turn are related through physical models to combustion behavior (with propagated uncertainties). Direct incorporation of theory in combustion model development is expected to yield more reliable extrapolation of limited data to conditions outside the validation set, which is particularly useful for extrapolating to engine-relevant conditions where relatively limited data are available. Several key features of the approach are demonstrated for the H2O2 decomposition mechanism, where a number of its constituent reactions continue to have large uncertainties in their temperature and pressure dependence despite their relevance to high-pressure, low-temperature combustion of a variety of fuels.

     "abstract": "The possibility that the reaction between two cyclopentadienyl radicals (cC5H5) may lead to the production of naphthalene has been the subject of considerable theoretical and experimental studies. Though it has been proposed that this reaction may be the main channel for the formation of naphthalene in many combustion environments, the elementary mechanism leading from the initial adduct (C5H5_C5H5) to naphthalene is still not clear. In this study the portion of the C10H10 PES accessible to C5H5_C5H5 has been theoretically re-examined using density functional theory to locate stationary points and the CBS-QB3 computational protocol to determine energies. A new reaction pathway leading to the formation of a set of azulyl radicals was identified. Since it is known that azulyl radicals can easily decompose to naphthalene and atomic H, the proposed pathway provides an effective route for the formation of naphthalene. Channel specific kinetic constants were determined between 1100\u00a0K and 2000\u00a0K integrating the master equation for a PES comprising both this reaction pathway and the literature reaction pathway, which main product is the fulvalenyl radical. It was found that the main reaction channel is decomposition to reactants in the whole temperature range investigated and that the azulyl reaction channel is dominant over the fulvalenyl pathway up to 1450\u00a0K. The rate constants calculated at 1\u00a0bar for the azulyl and fulvalenyl reaction channels are 1014.72T(K)\u22120.853\u00a0exp(\u22123650/T(K)) and 1010.30T(K)0.951\u00a0exp(\u22127948/T(K))\u00a0cm3/mol/s, respectively.

This study reports, for the first time, direct measurements of H2O2 and CH3OCHO, among other intermediate species concentrations in helium-diluted DME oxidation in an atmospheric pressure flow reactor from 490 to 750\u00a0K, using molecular beam electron-ionization mass spectrometry (MBMS). H2O2 measurements were directly calibrated, while a number of other species were quantified by both MBMS and micro gas chromatography to achieve cross-validation of the measurements. Experimental results were compared to two different DME kinetic models with an updated rate coefficient for the H\u00a0+\u00a0DME reaction, under both zero-dimensional and two-dimensional physical model assumptions. The results confirm that low and intermediate temperature DME oxidation produces significant amounts of H2O2. Peroxide, as well as O2, DME, CO, and CH3OCHO profiles are reasonably well predicted, though profile predictions for H2/CO2 and CH2O are poor above and below \u223c625\u00a0K, respectively.

Observed changes in measured H2O2 concentrations agree well with model predictions. The new experimental characterizations of important intermediate species including H2O2, CH2O and CH3OCHO, and a path flux analysis of the oxidation pathways of DME support that kinetic parameters for decomposition reactions of HOCH2OCO and HCOOH directly to CO2 may be responsible for model under-prediction of CO2. The H abstraction reactions for DME and/or CH2O and the unimolecular decomposition of HOCH2O merit further scrutiny towards improving the prediction of H2 formation.",

Using the measured 2-butanone and CO time-histories and an O-atom balance analysis, a missing removal pathway for methyl ketene was identified. The rate constant for the decomposition of methyl ketene was assumed to be the same as the value for the ketene decomposition reaction.

In situ AP crystal burning rates were found to be higher than rates reported for pure AP deflagration studies. The flame structure was studied by exciting OH molecules in the gas phase. Two types of diffusion flames were observed above the composite propellant: jet-like flames and v-shaped, inverted, overventilated, flames (IOF) lifted off the surface. While jet-like diffusion flames have been imaged at low pressures and simulated by models, the lifted IOFs have not been previously reported or predicted. The causes for the observed flame structures are explained by drawing on an understanding of the surface topography and disparities in the burning rates of the fuel and oxidizer.",

While piston crevices have been successful in controlling heat loss from the reaction chamber gases and improving the overall homogeneity of the reacting mixture, multi-stage ignition events can be sufficiently perturbed by spatial non-uniformities and there can be substantial gas flow into the crevice volume due to the preliminary, or low-temperature heat releases.

The emphasis is placed on assessing and interpreting the influence of Soret diffusion on the unstretched and stretched laminar flame speed and Markstein length of syngas/air mixtures. The laminar flame speed and Markstein length are obtained by simulating the unstretched planar flame and positively-stretched spherical flame, respectively. The results indicate that at atmospheric pressure the laminar flame speed of syngas/air is mainly reduced by Soret diffusion of H radical while the influence of H2 Soret diffusion is negligible. This is due to the facts that the main reaction zone and the Soret diffusion for H radical (H2) are strongly (weakly) coupled, and that Soret diffusion reduces the H concentration in the reaction zone. Because of the enhancement in the Soret diffusion flux of H radical, the influence of Soret diffusion on the laminar burning flux increases with the initial temperature and pressure. Unlike the results at atmospheric pressure, at elevated pressures the laminar flame speed is shown to be affected by the Soret diffusion of H2 as well as H radical. For stretched spherical flame, it is shown that the Soret diffusion of both H and H2 should be included so that the stretched flame speed can be accurately predicted. Similar to the laminar flame speed, the Markstein length is also reduced by Soret diffusion. However, the reduction is found to be mainly caused by Soret diffusion of H2 rather than that of H radical. Moreover, the influence of Soret diffusion on the Markstein length is demonstrated to decrease with the initial temperature and pressure.",

Burning rates were measured using outwardly propagating spherical flames in a nearly constant pressure chamber. Results show good agreement with newly updated kinetic models for H2 flames. However, there is considerable disagreement between simulations and measurements for H2/CO and C2H4 flames at high pressure and high water vapor dilution. Both experiments and simulations show that water vapor addition causes a monotonic decrease in mass burning rate and the inhibitory effect increases with pressure. For hydrogen flames, water vapor addition reduces the critical pressure above which a negative pressure dependence of the burning rate is observed. However, for C2H4 flames, the burning rate always increases with pressure. The results also show that water vapor addition has the same effect as a pressure increase for H2 and H2/CO flames, shifting the reaction zone into a narrower window at higher temperatures. For all fuels, water vapor addition increases OH formation via H2O\u00a0+\u00a0O while reducing the overall active radical pool for hydrogen flames. For C2H4, the additional HO2 production pathway through HCO results in a dramatic difference in pressure dependence of the burning rate from that observed for hydrogen.

The experiments for n-C14H30/air and n-C16H34/air mixtures were modeled using recently developed kinetic models, and the experimental data were predicted satisfactorily. Both experiments and simulations revealed that the laminar flame speeds of n-C14H30/air and n-C16H34/air mixtures are very close to each other, as expected. On the other hand, the laminar flame speeds for the four practical fuels were found to be lower than n-C14H30 and n-C16H34, due to the presence of aromatics and branched hydrocarbons. Similarly, the laminar flame speeds for the alternative fuels were found to be higher than the petroleum-derived ones, again due to the presence of aromatic compounds in the latter.

     "abstract": "A new method for extracting the laminar burning velocity from the difference between the flame speed and the local fresh gas velocity at the entrance of the flame front is used for ethanol/isooctane/air mixtures. This approach gives additional information in terms of flame sensitivity to flame stretch represented by the Markstein length relative to the fresh gases Lu and a direct measurement of the unstretched laminar burning velocity without any assumptions on adiabaticity and on the fuel mixture properties. The overall accuracy of the measurements obtained from the repeatability of the experiments is less than \u00b11.5\u00a0cm/s at P\u00a0=\u00a00.1\u00a0MPa and increases with pressure to reach \u00b13\u00a0cm/s at P\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0MPa. Measurements of the unstretched laminar burning velocities and Markstein lengths of ethanol/isooctane/air flames in the range of initial pressure from 0.1 to 1\u00a0MPa and for various ethanol mole fractions, \u220a, are presented. A globally good agreement is obtained with literature data for pure fuels, and with both mechanisms of Marinov and of Saxena for pure ethanol/air mixtures (except for rich ethanol/air flames in the case of Marinov mechanism) and with Jerzembeck mechanism for pure isooctane/air flames. The effect of pressure on the burning velocity of pure fuel is interpreted using the correlation u n 0 ( P ) = u n 0 ( P 0 ) ( P / P 0 ) \u03b2 . Particular attention has been paid to the effect of equivalence ratio and fuel blending on the power exponent \u03b2. Both experimental and numerical data show the existence of a minimum in \u03b2 for stoichiometric mixtures and a globally quadratic approximation with \u03d5. From our results, we demonstrate also the quasi insensitivity of \u03b2 with fuel blending. A general correlation is then proposed to express the effect of pressure, equivalence ratio and ethanol mole fraction in isooctane at a constant temperature of 373\u00a0K.

To vary the extent of the enhancement, methane/hydrogen mixtures were used. Furthermore, rich mixtures were used as a source of vortex ring so that the situation of the experiment and the results could be applied more directly to practical use. Results have confirmed that enhancement of flame speed does occur in vortex ring combustion of rich methane/hydrogen mixtures in air. The extent of the enhancement becomes larger as the hydrogen content is increased. The flame speed reaches about twice as high as the maximum tangential velocity for pure hydrogen. Based on momentum conservation across the flame, a simple equation on the ratio of the flame speed to the maximum tangential velocity has been obtained, which has shown that the flame speed enhancement can be explained successfully by considering the spherically expanding type premixed combustion behind the flame. The pressure rise of a spherically expanding type premixed flame can explain the flame speed enhancement observed in the present rich methane/hydrogen vortex ring combustion.",

Although there are many reliable experimental methods that provide precise burning velocities, these methods are not suitable for in situ monitoring in the field. In response to this limitation, a method using an annular diverging tube (ADT) was introduced in the previous study, and its feasibility was verified. In this study, an advanced technique using an annular stepwise diverging tube (ASDT) was introduced to enhance flow uniformity and to formulate flatter flames in the majority of experimental conditions. The configuration of the burner was gradually improved based on their flame propagation characteristics. An adapted burner configuration was developed and used to predict the laminar burning velocities of methane, propane, and DME. Two types of measuring methods were compared: a transient method, which was similar to the previous study, and a static method, which was used for a direct prediction of burning velocity. The static method predicts similar burning velocities when compared to the transient method. The results of both methods were sufficiently similar to the other\u2019s previous results. Quenching distances could also be directly predicted using this adapted ASDT system. Therefore, the static method may be the easiest and fastest method to predict burning velocity, and quenching distance at the instant. This method can be applied to the energy field and aid in the understanding of flame characteristics in narrow combustion spaces.",

As a matter of fact, PAHs formed from the 1-butanol doped flame are the lowest among the four investigated flames, because 1-butanol mainly decomposes to ethylene and oxygenates rather than C3 hydrocarbon species.

The primary purpose of the study is to provide an understanding of the autoignition of DME in a simplified configuration that is relevant to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines. The ignition structure and the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behaviour are characterised in a homogeneous domain and one-dimensional domains with thermal stratification, at different initial mean temperatures and length scales. The thermal stratification is shown to strongly affect the spatial structure and temporal progress of ignition. The importance of diffusion and conduction on the ignition progress is assessed. It is shown that the effects of molecular diffusion decay relative to those of chemical reaction as the length-scale increases. This is to be expected, however the present study shows that these characteristics also depend on the mean temperature due to NTC behaviour. For the range of conditions studied here, which encompass a range of stratification length scales expected in HCCI engines, the effects of molecular transport are found to be small compared with chemical reaction effects for mean temperatures within the NTC regime. This is in contrast to previous work with fuels with single-stage ignition behaviour where practically realisable temperature gradients can lead to molecular transport effects becoming important. In addition, thermal stratification is demonstrated to result in significant reductions of the pressure-rise rate (PRR), even for the present fuel with two-stage ignition and NTC behaviour. The reduction of PRR is however strongly dependent on the mean initial temperature. The stratification length-scale is also shown to have an important influence on the pressure oscillations, with large-amplitude oscillations possible for larger length scales typical of integral scales in HCCI engines.",

     "abstract": "To quantitatively understand the uncertainty of intrusive species sampling measurements using a microprobe, velocity and speciation profiles of acetone counterflow diffusion flames have been experimentally investigated with cross validations using non-intrusive particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements. It is shown that the separation distance between the fuel and oxidizer nozzles needs to be sufficiently large to achieve uniform radial velocity profiles at the nozzle exit and accurate measurements of fuel concentration distributions in flames. The impacts of the diffusion flame location relative to the stagnation plane and the diffusion flame thickness on quantitative species sampling are investigated by varying the fuel to oxygen ratio as well as nitrogen and helium as fuel diluents. The results show that the diffusion flame needs to be located on the fuel side far from the stagnation plane in order to obtain reliable speciation measurements of fuel oxidation-related species. For helium dilution in the fuel side, a significant deviation from the model prediction is found due to the excessively fast diffusion velocity of helium. The impact of the intrusive probe on the flow field and the structure of the counterflow diffusion flame are identified by acetone and OH LIF measurements. The uncertainty in the speciation measurement associated with flow perturbations by the probe is quantified and found to be comparable to the outer diameter of the probe, \u00b10.3\u00a0mm. A simple Reynolds number analysis shows that the flow near the probe is just on the outskirts of the Stokes regime. Finally, the structure of the acetone diffusion flame is measured quantitatively with species measurements of ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. The comparison between predictions and measurements indicate that the current C2 kinetic mechanism needs to be improved for quantitative prediction of the acetone flame structures.",

The solution is obtained using the method of matched asymptotic expansions taking advantage of the large difference between the solid- and gas-phase thermal conductivities. The model allows for thermal nonequilibrium between the phases and is able to predict the flame temperature, velocity and position as function of the stretch rate. The results show that within porous media low stretch rates may increase the flame temperature, further extending the lean flammability limit of the reactant mixture when compared to planar flames.

A uniform discharge was generated between the burner nozzles by placing porous metal electrodes at the nozzle exits. The ignition and extinction characteristics of CH4/O2/He diffusion flames were investigated by measuring excited OH\u2217 and OH PLIF, at constant strain rates and O2 mole fraction on the oxidizer side while changing the fuel mole fraction. It was found that ignition and extinction occurred with an abrupt change of OH\u2217 emission intensity at lower O2 mole fraction, indicating the existence of the conventional ignition-extinction S-curve. However, at a higher O2 mole fraction, it was found that the in situ discharge could significantly modify the characteristics of ignition and extinction and create a new monotonic and fully stretched ignition S-curve. The transition from the conventional S-curves to a new stretched ignition curve indicated clearly that the active species generated by the plasma could change the chemical kinetic pathways of fuel oxidation at low temperature, thus resulting in the transition of flame stabilization mechanism from extinction-controlled to ignition-controlled regimes. The temperature and OH radical distributions were measured experimentally by the Rayleigh scattering technique and PLIF technique, respectively, and were compared with modeling. The results showed that the local maximum temperature in the reaction zone, where the ignition occurred, could be as low as 900\u00a0K. The chemical kinetic model for the plasma\u2013flame interaction has been developed based on the assumption of constant electric field strength in the bulk plasma region. The reaction pathways analysis further revealed that atomic oxygen generated by the discharge was critical to controlling the radical production and promoting the chain branching effect in the reaction zone for low temperature ignition enhancement.",

There is extensive leakage of the ambient reactant for both normal and inverse flames near extinction, which results in a premixed flame regime for diffusion flames except for the smallest burners with radii on the order of 1\u00a0\u03bcm. At high flow rates H\u00a0+\u00a0OH(+M)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0H2O(+M) contributes nearly 50% of the net heat release. However at flow rates approaching quenching limits, H\u00a0+\u00a0O2(+M)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0HO2(+M) is the elementary reaction with the largest heat release rate.",

     "abstract": "This paper examines nonlinear thermoacoustic oscillations of a ducted Burke-Schumann diffusion flame. The nonlinear dynamics of the thermoacoustic system are studied using two distinct approaches. In the first approach, a continuation analysis is performed to find limit cycle amplitudes over a range of operating conditions. The strength of this approach is that one can characterize the coupled system\u2019s nonlinear behaviour over a large parameter space with relative ease. It is not able to give physical insight into that behaviour, however. The second approach uses a Flame Describing Function (FDF) to characterize the flame\u2019s response to harmonic velocity fluctuations over a range of forcing frequencies and forcing amplitudes, from which limit cycle amplitudes can be found. A strength of the FDF approach is that it reveals the physical mechanisms responsible for the behaviour observed. However, the calculation of the FDF is time consuming, and it must be recalculated if the flame\u2019s operating conditions change. With the strengths and shortcomings of the two approaches in mind, this paper advocates combining the two to provide the dynamics over a large parameter space and, furthermore, physical insight into that behaviour at judiciously-chosen points in the parameter space. Further physical insight concerning the flame\u2019s near-linear response at all forcing amplitudes is given by studying the forced flame in the time domain. It is shown that, for this flame model, the limit cycles arise because of the flame\u2019s nonlinear behaviour when it is close to the inlet.",

This coupled model is combined with our flame transfer function (FTF) model to predict the dynamic response of the flame to velocity perturbations. We show that modeling the thermal coupling between the flame and the burner, while accounting for the two-dimensionality of the former, is critical to predicting the dynamic response characteristics such as the overshoot in the gain curve (resonant condition) and the phase delay.

The transient flame speeds, trajectories, and critical radius are measured. The experimental results are compared with direct numerical simulations using detailed high temperature kinetic models. Both experimental and numerical results show that there exist multiple flame regimes in the unsteady spherical flame initiation process. The transition between the flame regimes depends strongly on the mixture equivalence ratio (or Lewis number). It is found that there is a critical flame radius and that it increases dramatically as the mixture equivalence ratio and pressure decrease. The large increase of critical flame radius leads to a dramatic increase of the minimum ignition energy. Furthermore, the flame thickness and the radical pool concentration change significantly during the transition from the ignition flame regime to the self-sustained propagating flame regime. For the same steady state flame speeds, the predicted unsteady flame speeds and the critical flame radius differ significantly from the experimental results. Moreover, different chemical kinetic mechanisms predict different unsteady flame speeds. The existence of multiple flame regimes and the large critical radius of lean liquid fuel mixtures make the ignition of lean mixtures at low pressure and the development of a validated kinetic model more challenging. The unsteady flame regimes, speeds, and critical flame radius should be included as targets of future kinetic model development for turbulent combustion modeling.",

     "abstract": "Hydrodynamically self-excited flames are often assumed to be insensitive to low-amplitude external forcing. To test this assumption, we apply acoustic forcing to a range of jet diffusion flames. These flames have regions of absolute instability at their base and this causes them to oscillate at discrete natural frequencies. We apply the forcing around these frequencies, at varying amplitudes, and measure the response leading up to lock-in. We then model the system as a forced van der Pol oscillator.Our results show that, contrary to some expectations, a hydrodynamically self-excited flame oscillating at one frequency is sensitive to forcing at other frequencies. When forced at low amplitudes, it responds at both frequencies as well as at several nearby frequencies, indicating quasiperiodicity. When forced at high amplitudes, it locks into the forcing. The critical forcing amplitude for lock-in increases both with the strength of the self-excited instability and with the deviation of the forcing frequency from the natural frequency. Qualitatively, these features are accurately predicted by the forced van der Pol oscillator. There are, nevertheless, two features that are not predicted, both concerning the asymmetries of lock-in. When forced below its natural frequency, the flame is more resistant to lock-in, and its oscillations at lock-in are stronger than those of the unforced flame. When forced above its natural frequency, the flame is less resistant to lock-in, and its oscillations at lock-in are weaker than those of the unforced flame. This last finding suggests that, for thermoacoustic systems, lock-in may not be as detrimental as it is thought to be.",

Application of a DC electric field (EF) as a spatially distributed, easily and quickly adjustable and low-energy method to affect the flame behaviour may be considered as a possible actuation method to control the flame TF. Experimental evaluation of such a possibility is the main goal of the present study. The effect of a DC EF on the acoustic TF of premixed flat burner-surface stabilized flames is studied systematically as a function of the following parameters: flow velocity, equivalence ratio, applied voltage and burner geometry. It is established that the response of the flame TF on the DC EF can be characterized as a TF shift towards higher frequencies. The mechanism of TF alteration is related to the decrease of the flame stand-off distance and the related increase of the burner deck surface temperature. From a practical point of view, the efficiency of the EF control of the flat flame TF is restricted to a relatively narrow frequency range around the position of the TF resonance peak. To get insight into the physics of the EF\u2013flame interaction, the method of [1] to measure the EF effect on the adiabatic flame speed is improved and the measurement range is extended. The new measurements allow a revision of previous results and allow an explanation for the ambiguity in the old measurements.",

     "abstract": "This paper describes the dynamics of non-premixed flames responding to bulk velocity fluctuations, and compares the dynamics of the flame sheet position and spatially integrated heat release to that of a premixed flame. The space\u2013time dynamics of the non-premixed flame sheet in the fast chemistry limit is described by the stoichiometric mixture fraction surface, extracted from the solution of the -equation. This procedure has some analogies to premixed flames, where the premixed flame sheet location is extracted from the G\u00a0=\u00a00 surface of the solution of the G-equation. A key difference between the premixed and non-premixed flame dynamics, however, is the fact that the non-premixed flame sheet dynamics are a function of the disturbance field everywhere, and not just at the reaction sheet, as in the premixed flame problem. A second key difference is that the non-premixed flame does not propagate and so flame wrinkles are convected downstream at the axial flow velocity, while wrinkles in premixed flames convect downstream at a vector sum of the flame speed and axial velocity. With the exception of the flame wrinkle propagation speed, however, we show that that the solutions for the space\u2013time dynamics of the premixed and non-premixed reaction sheets in high velocity axial flows are quite similar. In contrast, there are important differences in their spatially integrated unsteady heat release dynamics. Premixed flame heat release fluctuations are dominated by area fluctuations, while non-premixed flames are dominated by mass burning rate fluctuations. At low Strouhal numbers, the resultant sensitivity of both flames to flow disturbances is the same, but the non-premixed flame response rolls off slower with frequency. Hence, this analysis suggests that non-premixed flames are more sensitive to flow perturbations than premixed flames at O(1) Strouhal numbers.",

A topic of widespread speculation has concerned the effect of the CO2 gasification reaction with coal char on the char burning rate. To give clarity to the likely impact of this reaction on the oxy-fuel combustion of pulverized coal char, the Surface Kinetics in Porous Particles (SKIPPY) code was employed for a range of potential CO2 reaction rates for a high-volatile bituminous coal char particle (130\u00a0\u03bcm diameter) reacting in several O2 concentration environments. The effects of boundary layer chemistry are also examined in this analysis. Under oxygen-enriched conditions, boundary layer reactions (converting CO to CO2, with concomitant heat release) are shown to increase the char particle temperature and burning rate, while decreasing the O2 concentration at the particle surface. The CO2 gasification reaction acts to reduce the char particle temperature (because of the reaction endothermicity) and thereby reduces the rate of char oxidation. Interestingly, the presence of the CO2 gasification reaction increases the char conversion rate for combustion at low O2 concentrations, but decreases char conversion for combustion at high O2 concentrations. These calculations give new insight into the complexity of the effects from the CO2 gasification reaction and should help improve the understanding of experimentally measured oxy-fuel char combustion and burnout trends in the literature.",

The Babcock and Wilcox Company has been investigating coal secondary pyrolysis in order to develop a comprehensive mechanism for inclusion in predictive computational fluid dynamics and coal combustion models. Supportive experiments were carried out in an entrained-flow reactor. Tar was extracted from the pyrolysis byproducts of seven coals of widely-distributed rank at temperatures ranging from 923 to 1473\u00a0K, and analyzed by 13C NMR. Tars formed from higher rank coals generally demonstrated higher sooting propensities. This rank-dependent sooting propensity is associated with tar\u2019s chemical structure properties. With increased heat treatment severity, tar molecules lose a substantial amount of aliphatic attachments, and the average size of substitution per cluster decreases. Compared to tars formed from high-rank bituminous coals, those formed from low-rank sub-bituminous coals have a larger attachment portion, higher averaged substitution, and higher oxygen-containing functional groups. These differences contribute to the higher cracking propensity observed for low-rank coal tars.",

The base case of 60% moisture content coal preheated prior to combustion is compared with partially dried coal (with or without pre-heating) and coal dried to equilibrium moisture content (10\u201315%). Pulverised coal was combusted in a drop tube furnace and in-situ observations of combustion phenomena, particle temperature and gas temperature were made. An ignition delay was found to occur when partially dried coal was combusted without pre-heating. Flame stability was also decreased when wet coal was combusted without pre-heating. No ignition delay was observed when the water in coal was heated prior to entering the furnace, as in current boilers. The peak particle temperature was found to be higher than the wall temperature by around 130\u00a0\u00b0C for dried coal, 80\u00a0\u00b0C for preheated wet coal and 40\u00a0\u00b0C for non-preheated partially dried coal. The gas temperature profile in the furnace was measured and found to lag behind the particle temperature peak. It was concluded that the evolution and evaporation of water in the wet case lead to an ignition delay, cooler peak particle temperatures and prolonged char combustion. The difference in particle temperatures between preheated wet coal and dried coal and the gas temperature behaviour was attributed to the steam gasification reaction, although studies to elucidate reasons for the differences are ongoing. The quantified results on ignition delay and particle temperatures have important implications for the design of new technologies, in particular the boilers and feed size preparation, for power generation from high-moisture brown coals.",

The inherent sulphates in the lignite were dominated by iron sulphates which started to decompose and release SO2 at around 500\u00a0K and all sulphate had been decomposed at 1073\u00a0K. The retention of organic sulphur in the high organic sulphur lignite was higher than in its acid washed lignite sample, due to the interaction between inherent inorganic matter with the organic sulphur retaining the organic sulphur in the solid phase. SO2 was the only sulphur gas produced during pyrolysis of acid washed lignite. A comprehensive mechanism of sulphur transformation during pyrolysis of lignite was proposed.",

     "abstract": "This paper provides mechanistic insights into the low-temperature oxidation of a range of carbon materials (graphite, a sub-bituminous coal char, and a brown coal char). Kinetic analysis was carried out on oxidation of the chars, prepared from fast-heating pyrolysis, under chemical-reaction-controlled regime. FT-Raman spectroscopic analysis was adopted to provide direct structural information on the carbon structure of reacting carbon materials throughout oxidation. The results demonstrate the significance of selective oxidation under the conditions, and parallel to this, the kinetic compensation effect of carbon oxidation reaction throughout conversion for all samples. Supported by the results from FT-Raman spectroscopy, the kinetic compensation effect seems to be a result of the selective oxidation of these carbon materials with heterogeneous carbon structures. Oxidation of all samples, with or without catalysts, appears to be similar in terms of the \u2018nature\u2019 of carbon structural condensation during low-temperature oxidation, suggesting a similar increase in apparent active sites population with respect to increase of apparent energy barrier. Under the current experimental conditions, a general kinetic compensation effect correlation has been deduced for various materials, requiring only the initial char kinetic parameters. The inherent inorganic species in chars also seem to alter the \u2018degree/extent\u2019 of carbon structural condensation as results of selective oxidation. In this case, the use of the compensation effect correlation will require more information on the catalysis during oxidation, apart from the initial char kinetic parameters.",

The simulation results are compared to experimental data obtained for the inlet stoichiometric ratios of 0.14, 0.22, and 0.36. An accurate and computationally inexpensive devolatilization model suitable for combustion simulation in LES is proposed and incorporated into the LES. The numerical results of gas temperature and coal burnout on the centerline show good agreement with the experimental data. Two kinds of lift-off heights are introduced to verify the combustion simulation. One is the height from the primary nozzle exit to the starting point of the growing flame region. The other is the height from the primary nozzle exit to the starting point of the continuous flame region. The calculated results of the two lift-off heights show good agreement with the experimental data. In contrast to LES, the standard k\u2013\u03b5 model overestimates the lift-off heights because it calculates time-averaged temperature which does not contain information about local flame structure. The stoichiometric ratio in the gas phase at the starting point of the growing flame region is found to be independent of the inlet stoichiometric ratio in the range from 0.14 to 0.36.",

Slagging and fouling limit however the reliability of the units that were initially designed for coal combustion. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes aiming at studying those phenomena include simplified models of biomass particle pyrolysis, of which the pertinence has already been questioned for the typical conditions of interest. A comprehensive model has been developed to investigate pyrolysis of particles in pulverized-fuel boilers, with sizes ranging from 17\u00a0\u03bcm to 2.5\u00a0mm. The detailed model accounts for internal heat conduction, internal gaseous convection, moisture evaporation and particle shrinkage. It includes a competitive, multi-component kinetic scheme, improved for high temperatures. The discrepancy between the simplified models integrated in most CFD applications and the detailed simulations is highlighted. The simplified isothermal models underestimate pyrolysis time for the largest particles. Moreover, such models delay and shorten the volatiles release. The flame lengths, the local temperature fields and the pollutant emissions might be importantly impacted in global combustion simulations. Apparent kinetic parameters have been derived from the detailed simulations. Their use in existing simplified models improves the behavior of the biomass particles during pyrolysis, and offers therefore an efficient alternative to the integration of complex pyrolysis models in CFD codes.",

It was easier to control the height of the packed bed under the downdraft condition than under the updraft condition. Under the updraft condition, a bridging phenomenon occurred.

The surrogate mixture exhibits similar ignition\u2013extinction behavior and autothermal temperatures compared to JP-8 suggesting the possibility of using this surrogate mixture for detailed kinetics of catalytic combustion of JP-8. It is shown that JP-8 ignites at low temperatures in the presence of catalyst. Upon ignition, catalytic combustion of JP-8 and the surrogate mixture is self-sustained and robust combustion is observed under fuel lean as well as fuel rich conditions. It is shown that the ignition temperature of the hydrocarbon fuels increases with increasing equivalence ratio. Extinction is observed under fuel lean conditions, whereas sustained combustion was also observed for fuel rich conditions. The effect of dilution in the air flow on the catalytic ignition and autothermal temperatures of the fuel mixture is also investigated by adding helium to the air stream while keeping the flow rate and the equivalence ratio constant. The autothermal temperature decreases linearly as the amount of dilution in the flow is increased, whereas the ignition temperature shows no dependence on the dilution level under the range of our conditions, showing that ignition is dependent only on the type and relative concentration of the active species.",

The heterogeneous chemistry is analysed using two independently developed detailed heterogeneous reaction mechanisms [1], [2].

Experiments are performed in an optically accessible channel-flow catalytic reactor and involve planar laser induced fluorescence (LIF) of the OH radical for the assessment of homogeneous (gas-phase) ignition and 1-D Raman measurements of major gas-phase species concentrations over the catalyst boundary layer for the evaluation of the heterogeneous (catalytic) processes. Simulations are carried out with an elliptic 2-D model that includes detailed heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reaction schemes. The predictions reproduce the Raman-measured catalytic CO and H2 consumption, and it is further shown that for wall temperatures in the range 975\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0Tw\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a01165\u00a0K the heterogeneous pathways of CO and H2 are largely decoupled. However, for wall temperatures below a limiting value of 710\u2013720\u00a0K and for the range of pressures and mixture preheats investigated, CO(s) blockage of the surface inhibits the catalytic conversion of both fuel components. The homogeneous ignition distance is well-reproduced by the model for TIN\u00a0>\u00a0426\u00a0K, but it is modestly overpredicted at lower TIN. Possible reasons for these modest differences can be the values of third body efficiencies in the gas-phase reaction mechanism. The sensitivity of homogeneous ignition distance on the catalytic reactions is weak, while the H2/O2 subset of the CO/H2/O2 gaseous reaction mechanism controls the onset of homogeneous ignition. Pure hydrogen hetero-/homogeneous combustion results in flames established very close to the catalytic walls. However, in the presence of CO the gaseous combustion of hydrogen extends well-inside the channel core, thus allowing homogeneous consumption of H2 at considerably shorter reactor lengths. Finally, implications of the above findings for the design of syngas-based catalytic reactors for power generation systems are discussed.",

The initial reaction forms a peroxide, \u0394H\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212135\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121. If the graphene edge is pre-oxidised, the dangling peroxy atom can (Ea\u00a0=\u00a091\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121) migrate across contiguous ketone groups until finding another vacant site and stabilizing as a ketone. However, if no further vacant sites are available, the peroxy oxygen has a number of other possibilities open to it, including desorption of an oxygen atom (Ea\u00a0=\u00a0140\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121), migration via the basal plane to form a lactone (Ea\u00a0=\u00a0147\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121), and direct interaction with an adjacent oxide to form the lactone or a carbonate (Ea\u00a0=\u00a0146\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121). The combination of thermal energy and the heat released in the initial formation of the peroxy adduct is likely to be sufficient to overcome these secondary barriers at modest temperatures.Transfer of the dangling peroxy O to the basal plane produces an epoxide that is mobile on the basal surface (Ea\u00a0=\u00a040\u201380\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121) but that is transferred back to the edge upon coming into proximity of either a vacant edge site or ketone. The instability of the edge epoxide structure implies that it cannot play a significant role in carbon gasification through promoting the reactivity of ketones, contrary to earlier suggestions.The desorption of an oxygen atom creates a very active species capable of reacting with basal or edge sites as well as with oxygen complexes. The reaction of ketone\u00a0+\u00a0O has been reported to yield a five-membered ring\u00a0+\u00a0CO2, leading to an overall stoichiometry which is consistent with the observed oxyreactivity of carbon surface oxides identified in isotopic labelling studies in which one O atom is gasified and the other forms a new surface oxide.",

The Eu surface enrichment in H2/O2 flames was attributed to elemental partitioning during solidification of molten Y2O3:Eu particles; in H2/air flames the particles did not melt and hence there was no elemental surface enrichment.

Under fuel-lean conditions, diverse WO3 nanostructures, including monoclinic 1D nanowires, cubic 2D nanobelts and monoclinic 3D nanocones were grown on tungsten and FTO substrates. The success of this versatile flame synthesis method is attributed to the large tunability of several synthesis parameters, including the flame stoichiometry, the tungsten source and growth substrate temperatures, the tungsten oxide vapor concentration, and the material of the growth substrate. This flame synthesis method can be extended to synthesize other 1D transition metal oxides as well, enabling many large-scale electronic and energy conversion applications.",

The probe diameter and oxygen content in the oxidizer were varied to study their influence on the growth of tungsten-oxide nanostructures. The introduction of a 1-mm diameter W probe into the flame environment with an oxidizer composition of 50%O2\u00a0+\u00a050%N2, resulted in the formation of 1-D nanorods on the upper surface of the probe. The formation of triangular, rectangular, square, and cylindrical 3-D channels with completely hollow or semi-hollow morphology was achieved by reducing the probe diameter to 0.5\u00a0mm. Whereas, the increase of the O2 content to 100% and the employment of a 1-mm probe resulted in the growth of ribbon-like micron-sized structures. The lattice spacing of \u223c0.38\u00a0nm measured for the 1-D W-oxides closely matches a monoclinic WO3 structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the larger 3-D structures also consist of WO3 confirming that the chemical composition of the structures remains the same while varying the probe and flame parameters. The proposed growth mechanism states that the 3-D WO3 structures are formed through the lateral coalescence of 1-D W-oxide nanorods.",

Reducing the sizes of Al and metal oxides down to the nanoscale has been shown to be effective in increasing their reaction rates and reducing their ignition delays. However, it remains a challenge to create mixtures of Al and metal oxides with nanoscale uniformity. Here we report synthesis and ignition studies on thermites with a new nanostructure, i.e., CuO/Al core/shell nanowires (NWs). The CuO NW cores were synthesized by the thermal annealing of copper films and served as templates for the deposition of Al shells by subsequent sputtering. The advantage of such a core/shell NW structure is that CuO and Al are uniformly mixed at the nanoscale. The onset temperatures of the exothermic reaction of the core/shell NWs were similar to those of nanoparticle (NP)-based thermites in terms of magnitude, insensitivity to equivalence ratios and sensitivity to heating rates. Moreover, the core/shell NW thermites, compared to NP-based thermites, exhibit greatly improved mixing uniformity and reduced activation energy for the thermite reaction.",

The mechanism by which the reaction propagates is not well understood. The reaction temperature, the heating rate, and the reaction zone thickness are critical parameters to understanding the mechanism. Measurements of the reaction temperature for the Al/CuO, Al/MoO3, and Al/Fe2O3 nano-thermite systems were made using multi-wavelength pyrometry for two experimental configurations. In one experiment, the radiative emission from the reaction of a small, unconfined pile (\u223c10\u00a0mg) of reacting nano-thermite is collected over a 50\u00a0ms integration time and the temperature is measured. In a second experiment, the radiative emission was collected from a single spot, with a diameter of 1.5\u00a0mm, on a transparent tube filled with the nano-thermite as the combustion wave passes and the spectrum is temporally resolved using a streak tube and detected using an intensified CCD camera. Temperature traces from these experiments show a temperature ramping period followed by a plateau in temperature. For Al/CuO, the average temperature from the unconfined pile experiment was 2390\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0150\u00a0K, and the average plateau temperature for the temporally resolved measurements was approximately 2250\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0100\u00a0K. For Al/MoO3, the unconfined pile experiment yielded an average temperature of 2150\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0100\u00a0K, and the average plateau temperature was the same. The temperature measured from the Al/Fe2O3 unconfined pile experiment was 1735\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0K. The measured temperatures suggest that the gases generated during the reactions are primarily from the decomposition or vaporization of the various metal oxides. Furthermore, for Al/CuO and Al/MoO3, which can be classified as \u2018fast\u2019 nano-thermites, it was shown that the length scale associated with the temperature rise is much longer than classical conduction driven reactions.",

The model is validated against experimental burn time data and appears to be fairly correct despite its simplicity. The unsteady combustion is then investigated by superimposing an acoustic disturbance to the mean flow. The velocity-coupled response is computed for different frequencies and slip Reynolds numbers. A resonance peak is found to occur when the acoustic time scale matches the gas diffusion time scale. For lower frequencies however (typically below a few kHz), a quasi-steady regime seems to hold out which means that assuming quasi-steady combustion (e.g., given by a D2 model) is valid in this case.

By varying compact and particle sizes, mixture ratio, and degree of dilution, spontaneous ignition temperature has been measured, which is determined from the inflection-point of the temporal variations of the surface temperature. It is found that the spontaneous ignition temperature decreases with increasing aspect ratio, defined as the ratio of the sample height and compact diameter, due to an establishment of the stationary temperature distribution in the radial direction in the compacted mixture, as the sample height becomes tall. It is also found that the spontaneous ignition temperature decreases with increasing size ratio, defined as the ratio of compact and particle diameters, due to an increase in the particle surface per unit spatial volume of the compacted mixture, caused by a decrease in the particle diameter and/or an increase in the compact diameter. By further examining its dependence on mixture ratio and/or degree of dilution, it is confirmed that the limit of flammability also exerts influences on the spontaneous ignition temperature. In addition, a fair degree of agreement, shown in experimental comparisons with theoretical results, indicates that the present formulation has captured the essential features of the spontaneous ignition of compacted mixture. Since this kind of particle size effect, especially, relevant to the spontaneous ignition of compacted mixtures, has not been captured in the previous studies, its elucidation can be considered not only notable but also useful, especially, in manipulating combustion process in materials synthesis.",

     "abstract": "The so-called argon/helium test is proposed to identify the combustion mode of particles in iron dust flames. Iron powders of different particle sizes varying from 3 to 34\u00a0\u03bcm were dispersed in simulated air compositions where nitrogen was replaced by argon and helium. Due to the independence of the particle burning rate on the oxygen diffusivity in the kinetic mode, the ratio between the flame speeds in helium and argon mixtures is expected to be smaller if the particle burning rate is controlled by reaction kinetics rather than oxygen diffusion. Experiments were performed in a reduced-gravity environment on a parabolic flight aircraft to prevent particle settling and buoyancy-driven disruption of the flame. Uniform suspensions of the iron powders were produced inside glass tubes and a flame was initiated at the open end of the tube. Quenching plate assemblies of various channel widths were installed inside the tube and pass or quench events were used to measure the quenching distance. Flame propagation was recorded by a high-speed digital camera and spectral measurements were used to determine the temperature of the condensed emitters in the flame. The measured flame speeds and quenching distances were in good agreement with previously developed one-dimensional, dust flame model where the particles are assumed to burn in a diffusive mode and heat losses are described on a volumetric basis. However, a significant drop of the ratio of flame speeds in helium and argon mixtures was observed for finer 3\u00a0\u03bcm particles and was attributed to a transition from the combustion controlled by diffusion for larger particles to kinetically controlled burning of micron-size particles. In helium mixtures, the lower flame temperatures measured in suspensions of fine particles in comparison to larger particles reinforces this assumption.",

     "abstract": "Results from combustion experiments, in which the fuel and oxidizer particle sizes of Al/CuO and Al/MoO3 thermites were varied between the nanometer and micrometer scale, are presented to gain further insight into the factors governing their rate of propagation. The experiments were performed with thermite mixtures loosely packed in an instrumented burn tube. Critical properties, including linear propagation rates, dynamic pressure, and spectral emission, were measured and compared to determine if the scale of one constituent had more influence over the rate of propagation than the other. It was found that, although nano-fuel/nano-oxidizer composites propagated the fastest for both the Al/CuO and Al/MoO3 thermites, composites containing micron-aluminum and a nano-scale oxidizer propagated significantly faster than a composite of nano-aluminum and a micron-scale oxidizer. The impact of nano-scale oxidizer versus nano-scale Al is twofold. Firstly, mixtures containing nano-aluminum have a greater mass percentage of Al2O3, which reduces reaction temperatures and propagation rates. Secondly, reactions in porous nano-thermites propagate through a convective mechanism; with heat transfer being driven by flow induced by large pressure gradients. Mixtures containing nano-scale oxidizer particles show faster pressurization rates. Because the majority of gas generation is due to the decomposition or vaporization of the oxide in these reactions, and oxide particles on the nano-scale have shorter heat-up times and smaller length scales for gas diffusion than micron particles, convective burning is greatly enhanced with the nano-scale oxidizer.",

As a specific example, the situation with isolated n-pentane droplets in nitrogen is studied at various forcing frequencies. Results are correlated with the liquid thermal inertial time, instantaneous droplet radius, and oscillation frequency. The magnitude of the vaporization response increases with increasing pressure, mainly due to the decreased enthalpy of vaporization at high pressures. The increased sensitivity of droplet thermophysical properties to ambient flow variations at high pressures also plays a role. The phase angle of the vaporization response function, however, appears to be independent of the ambient pressure. An abrupt increase in the response function takes place when the droplet surface reaches its critical mixing state. A major factor contributing to this phenomenon is the abnormal variations of fluid thermophysical properties near the critical mixing point.",

On the other hand, the movement of ions and electrons affects the external electric field due to their charge. This paper reports the combustion experiments of ethanol droplets in vertical electric field with variable distance electrodes apparatus in order to discuss the change of the external electric field due to the existence of flame. From a one-dimensional steady-state analysis, if the electric field is changed spatially, its effect on combustion behavior is aligned with V2/L3 and not V/L, where V is the applied voltage between electrodes, and L is distance between the electrodes. The droplet is burned between the two horizontal parallel electrodes. The flame deformation and the electric current are characterized by various electrode distances, and respectively, applied voltages. The vertical electric field induces a body force downwards on the flame. The flame deforms downward in the electric field because the electric body force counters the natural buoyancy. The relation between the applied voltage and electrode distance is investigated when the flame becomes vertically symmetrical and the results show that the deformation is the function of V/L1.5. This indicates that the change in the electric field should be considered to discuss the effect of an external electric field on combustion behavior. The experimental results are rearranged using \u03b5V2/L3 where \u03b5 is electric permittivity of air because its unit is N/m3 and it considered to be the representative electric body force.

Normal gravity and microgravity (10\u22124\u00a0m/s2) droplet ignition delay experiments were conducted by use of a variety of neat methyl esters and commercial soy methyl ester. Droplet ignition experiments were chosen because spherically symmetric droplet combustion represents the simplest two-phase, time-dependent chemically reacting flow system permitting a numerical solution with complex physical submodels. To create spherically symmetric conditions for direct comparison with a detailed numerical model, experiments were conducted in microgravity by use of a 1.1\u00a0s drop tower. In the experiments, droplets were grown and deployed onto 14\u00a0\u03bcm silicon carbide fibers and injected into a tube furnace containing atmospheric pressure air at temperatures up to 1300\u00a0K.

From evolutions of the droplet diameter squared, the instantaneous burning rates are calculated. Time history of the instantaneous burning rate clearly represents the droplet combustion events, such as the initial thermal expansion, ignition and following combustion. The instantaneous burning rate for n-decane shows an increasing trend during combustion, while that for non-sooting ethanol remains almost constant or shows a decreasing trend. A slight stepwise increase in the instantaneous burning rate is observed for larger n-decane droplets in air, which may be attributed to soot accumulation. However, this behavior of the burning rate disappears in higher concentration of carbon dioxide. Direct observation of the droplet flame indicates suppression of soot production in higher concentration of carbon dioxide and the suppression is enhanced for smaller droplet.",

The latter effect leads has increases the flame speed of rich mixtures, but decreases that of lean ones. Droplet enhancement of burning velocity can be significant at low turbulence but is negligible at high turbulence.",

A perturbation analysis using a small Stokes number is used for solving the liquid phase governing equations. The effect of droplet grouping in the oscillatory flow field is accounted for by constructing an appropriate model for the vaporization Damkohler number. A formal analytical solution is developed for the Schwab-Zeldovitch parameter through which instantaneous flame front shapes are found. Computed results based on the solution expose the strong impact that the phenomenon of droplet grouping can have on flame characteristics such as flame height, shape and type (over- or under-ventilated).

Secondary atomization was observed using a single droplet experiment in which a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsified fuel droplet prepared using colored water was heated by a halogen heater. The initial diameter of dispersed water droplets before heating was controlled, and the change in the diameter of dispersed water droplets was measured by image analysis. As a result, the aggregation process of dispersed water droplets in the heating process was successfully visualized. The dispersed water droplet diameter increased with an increase in W/O emulsified fuel droplet temperature. The occurrence probability of micro-explosion increased with an increase in the dispersed water droplet diameter in emulsified fuel droplets. It is suggested that the occurrence probability of micro-explosion can be increased by accelerating the aggregation and coalescence of dispersed water droplets below 430\u00a0K, which is the average temperature of the starting point of puffing.",

The computations are carried out with the finest grid resolutions ever that can resolve the final droplet generation by surface tension. The numerical methods are based on level-set interface tracking. The methods were validated by test cases and the grid resolution survey shows that the resolutions for the present study are sufficient. The present flow setup excludes nozzle disturbances to investigate how the disturbances from the liquid jet front would lead to atomization where the liquid jet impacts against the quiescent gas. The liquid jet front becomes an umbrella-like shape. From the front umbrella tip edge, ligament breakup first occurs. Ligament breakup is strongly correlated with the gas motion in the vicinity. The gas region behind the front is highly disturbed by atomization. By the gas recirculation motion here, air and some droplets are entrained and mixed. Also, the disturbances are fed back to the front umbrella by this motion and become synchronized with the breakup. Droplet pinch-off is mainly in the short-wave mode, but some ligaments are elongated by local gas stretch to finally have a long-wave mode shape, namely a mode shift occurs. The above findings of liquid jet front umbrella formation, atomization at the umbrella edge, mixing and atomization loop in the recirculation flow region and droplet generation mode give an insight to the modeling of droplet generation in actual sprays.",

Depending upon the initial conditions and other constraints, a flame is established early as either a wake flame or an envelope flame. An initial envelope flame remains an envelope flame, and an initial wake flame has a tendency to develop from a wake flame to an envelope flame. The flame shows no strong tendency to modify significantly the standoff distance during the lifetime of the droplet. For an initial wake flame, the moment of wake-to-envelope transition is advanced as the initial droplet spacing (intermediate) is decreased, but tends to be postponed as the initial droplet spacing is further reduced. The burning rate at smaller initial droplet spacing or smaller initial Reynolds number might be greater for some period during the lifetime because of an earlier wake-to-envelope transition which elevates the average surface temperature. Lower ambient temperature yields a later wake-to-envelope transition time and smaller mass burning rate. At the lower ambient pressure with the same initial relative stream velocity, the average surface temperature is reduced, the wake-to-envelope transition is later, and the mass burning rate is smaller. Validation of our analysis is made by comparing with the results of an isolated droplet Wu and Sirignano [11].",

Dispersed droplets are tracked in a Lagrangian framework. Droplet evaporation is described by an equilibrium model. Gas combustion is represented using an adaptive one-step irreversible reaction. Two different cases are studied: a lean case that resembles a lean direct injection combustion, and a rich case that represents the primary combustion region of a rich-burn/quick-quench/lean-burn combustor. The results suggest that premixed combustion contribute more than 70% to the total heat release rate, although diffusion flame have volumetrically a higher contribution. The conditional mean scalar dissipation rate is shown to be strongly influenced, especially in the rich case. The conditional mean evaporation rate increases almost linearly with mixture fraction in the lean case, but shows a more complex behavior in the rich case. The probability density functions (PDF) of mixture fraction in spray combustion are shown to be quite complex. To model this behavior, the formulation of the PDF in a transformed mixture fraction space is proposed and demonstrated to predict the DNS data reasonably well.",

Three-dimensional numerical simulations of explosion fields from 1.5-g PETN/TNT charges were performed.

All the computations are performed on a small Beowulf cluster with six nodes. The dependency of the structure on the grid resolution is performed and it is found that, resolution of more than 300 cells per hrl is required to demonstrate the role of hydrodynamic instabilities, (KH and RM instabilities) in detonation propagation in irregular structures, while due to the absence of fine-scale structures, resolution of 50 cells per hrl, gives the physical structure of detonation with regular structures. Results show that the transverse waves in irregular structure are significantly stronger than the transverse wave in regular structure detonation, which can enhance the burning rate of the unburned pockets behind the shock front. Results for resolution of 600 cells per hrl illustrate that, in addition to the primary mode, the interaction of large vortices with the shock front provides secondary modes in the structure which leads to the irregularity of the structure in high activation energy mixture. In contrast with the results obtained for regular structure, which no unburned gas pockets and vortices observed behind the front, the results for irregular structure reveal that most portions of the gases, escape from shock compression and create large unburned gas pockets behind the both weak section of the Mach stem and the incident wave, which will burn eventually by the turbulent mixing due to the vortices associated with hydrodynamic instabilities. Therefore, the ignition mechanism in irregular structure is due to the both shock compression and by turbulent mixing associated with hydrodynamic instabilities, while the shock compression yields the ignition mechanism in regular structure detonation.",

In this article we describe results from time-accurate calculations of RDE\u2019s using algorithms that have successfully been used for PDE simulations previously. Results are obtained for stoichiometric hydrogen\u2013air RDE\u2019s operating at a range of stagnation pressures and back pressures. Conditions within the chamber are described as well as inlet and outlet conditions and integrated quantities such as total mass flow, force, and specific impulse. Further computations examine the role of inlet stagnation pressure and back pressure on detonation characteristics and engine performance. The pressure ratio is varied between 2.5 and 20 by varying both stagnation and back pressure to isolate controlling factors for the detonation and performance characteristics. It is found that the detonation wave height and mass flow rate are determined primarily by the stagnation pressure, whereas overall performance is closely tied to pressure ratio. Specific impulses are calculated for all cases and range from 2872 to 5511\u00a0s, and are lowest for pressure ratios below 4. The reason for performance loss is shown to be associated with the secondary shock wave structure that sets up in the expansion portion of the RDE, which strongly effects the flow at low pressure ratios. Expansion to supersonic flow behind the detonation front in RDE\u2019s with higher pressure ratios isolate the detonation section of the RDE and thus limit the effect of back pressure on the detonation characteristics.",

     "abstract": "Detonations in explosive mixtures of ammonium-nitrate-fuel-oil (ANFO) confined by aluminum allow for transport of detonation energy ahead of the detonation front due to the aluminum sound-speed exceeding the detonation velocity. The net effect of this energy transport on the detonation is unclear. It could enhance the detonation by precompressing the explosive near the wall. Alternatively, it could decrease the explosive performance by crushing porosity required for initiation by shock compression or destroying confinement ahead of the detonation. At present, these phenomena are not well understood. But with slowly detonating, non-ideal high explosive (NIHE) systems becoming increasing prevalent, proper understanding and prediction of the performance of these metal-confined NIHE systems is desirable. Experiments are discussed that measured the effect of ANFO detonation energy transported upstream of the front by a 76-mm-inner-diameter aluminum confining tube. Detonation velocity, detonation front-shape, and aluminum response are recorded as a function of confiner wall thickness and length. Detonation shape profiles display little curvature near the confining surface, which is attributed to energy transported upstream modifying the flow. Average detonation velocities were seen to increase with increasing confiner thickness, while wavefront curvature decreased due to the stiffer, subsonic confinement. Significant radial sidewall tube motion was observed immediately ahead of the detonation. Axial motion was also detected, which interfered with the front-shape measurements in some cases. It was concluded that the confiner was able to transport energy ahead of the detonation and that this transport has a definite effect on the detonation by modifying its characteristic shape.",

Addition of gaseous nitrogen reduces only slightly the peak pressure, but the detonation velocity is reduced by about 30%.",

     "abstract": "Utilizing liquid kerosene as the fuel, oxygen as oxidizer and nitrogen as purge gas, a series of multi-cycle detonation experiments was conducted to improve the performance of pulse detonation rocket engine (PDRE). In order to improve the performance of the engine, it is crucial to develop an effective DDT enhancement device with less flow loss and higher survival in hostile detonation tube; therefore, three spiraling internal grooves were tested. The three spiraling internal grooves were semicircle, square and inversed-triangle grooves, respectively. The results showed that the spiraling internal groove can effectively enhance DDT and prolong the operation time of PDRE. The effect of groove shape on thrust enhancement of PDRE and the optimum length of spiraling groove were then investigated. To improve the detonability of liquid kerosene and prolong the durability of PDRE, experiments on the kerosene preheating based on active cooling were conducted. The results demonstrated that with the aid of fuel preheating, the detonation initiation time for liquid kerosene was noticeably reduced and a fully-developed detonation wave was achieved in the position away from igniter 4.67 times the diameter of the detonation tube. By adding the additive to liquid kerosene, the detonation initiation time from 0.75\u00a0ms decreased to 0.34\u00a0ms and the detonability of fuel was dramatically improved. Finally, experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of the operating frequency on the detonation parameters, the fill fraction and PDRE performance. The results indicated that detonation pressure and temperature vary with the operating frequency of PDRE, and the fill fraction has a significant influence on the specific impulse of PDRE. With the strategy of partial filling in detonation tube, the specific impulse can be remarkably enhanced.",

     "abstract": "A hybrid two-phase numerical methodology is used to investigate the flow-field subsequent to the detonation of a spherical charge of TNT with an ambient distribution of a dilute cloud of aluminum particles. The interaction of the particle cloud with the contact surface results in Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability, which grows in time and gives rise to a mixing layer where the detonation products mix with the air and afterburn. At early times, the ambient particles get engulfed into the detonation products and ignite. Subsequently, they catch up with the Rayleigh\u2013Taylor structures, and the vortex rings around the hydrodynamic structures cause transverse dispersion that results in the clustering of particles. Then, the particles leave the mixing layer and quench, yet preserve their hydrodynamic foot print. Preferential heating and combustion of particles occurs due to clustering. A higher initial mass loading in the ambient cloud results in larger clusters due to stronger/larger vortex rings around the hydrodynamic structures. A larger particle size results in the formation of fewer and degenerate clusters when the initial width of the cloud is larger. A theoretical model is used to predict the bubble amplitudes, and are in good accordance with the simulation results. Overall, this study has provided some useful insights on the explosive dispersal of dilute aluminum particle clouds and the gas dynamics of the flow field in the mixing layer.",

Direct initiation is achieved via a high voltage capacitor spark discharge and the critical energy is estimated from the analysis of the current output. Stoichiometric acetylene\u2013oxygen mixtures highly diluted with 70% argon is used in the experiment. Previous investigations have suggested that detonations in mixtures that are highly diluted with argon have been shown to be \u201cstable\u201d in that the reaction zone is at least piecewise laminar described by the ZND model and cellular instabilities play a minor role on the detonation propagation. For the acetylene\u2013oxygen mixture that is highly diluted with argon, the experimental results show that the critical energy where the detonation is \u201cstable\u201d is in good agreement with the Zel\u2019dovich criterion of the cubic dependence on the ZND reaction length, which can be readily determined using the chemical kinetic data of the reaction. The experimental results are also compared with those estimated using Lee\u2019s surface energy model where empirical data on detonation cell sizes are required. Good agreement is found between the experimental measurement and theoretical model prediction, where the breakdown of the 13\u03bb relationship for critical tube diameter \u2013 and hence a different propagation and initiation mechanism \u2013 is elucidated in highly argon diluted mixtures and this appears to indicate that cellular instabilities do not have a prominent effect on the initiation process of a stable detonation.",

It was determined that at this high speed a well defined planar shock wave precedes a thick reaction zone. It was also shown that there is a transition in the flame propagation mechanism, similar to that observed in an obstacle laden channel [G. Ciccarelli and C.

The cellular structure can range from being very regular, to very irregular, where new modes are continuously formed on the front of the detonation wave. The present work addresses the mechanism of new cell formation in irregular structure detonations. Using idealized one-step chemistry calculations on sufficiently wide domains, as to avoid mode-locking, the present work reveals a novel mechanism for new mode formation in cellular detonations. The mechanism involves the creation of wave bifurcations on the front of the Mach shock following triple shock collisions. The numerical simulations reveal that these new triple points, through further reflections with pre-existing modes in asymmetric cells, can give rise to cell multiplication. Parameters favourable to this mechanism were found in good correlation with parameters leading to irregular cellular structures, as observed in previous experiments.",

The flame was ignited at the center of the 1.5\u00a0m long smooth tube under ambient pressure and temperature before propagated towards the exits in the opposite directions. A total of five reaction propagation scenarios, including deflagration-to-detonation transition followed by steady detonation wave transmission (DDT/C\u2013J detonation), oscillating flame, steady deflagration, galloping detonation and quenching flame, were identified. DDT/C\u2013J detonation mode was observed for all tubes for equivalence ratios in the vicinity of stoichiometry. The velocity for the steady detonation wave propagation was approximately Chapman\u2013Jouguet velocity for 1, 2, and 3\u00a0mm I.D. tubes; however, a velocity deficit of 5% was found for the case in 0.5\u00a0mm I.D. tube.

Galloping detonation wave propagation was the dominant mode for the fuel lean regime in the 0.5\u00a0mm I.D. tube.

     "abstract": "Recently, consequence analyses of accidental gas explosions are often carried out to assess the risk of chemical plants, hazardous-materials sites and new energy systems. In these consequence analyses, it is indispensable to adequately predict the blast-wave (pressure-wave) intensity from gas deflagrations. Some prediction models already exist; however, most of them are based on the theory for explosives and adjusting parameters are needed for evaluating gas deflagrations. In this study, new prediction methods for gas deflagrations were developed. From theoretical analysis of blast-wave generation by a gas deflagration, an evaluation equation of the blast-wave intensity was derived. As the scale of gas deflagration becomes larger, flame front instability (especially hydrodynamic instability) would be more effective and the flame propagating velocity starts to be accelerated. Therefore, the equation was modified considering the effect of flame instability. The evaluations by this modified equation agreed well with the results of large scale experiments. By this analysis, it was found that not only total energy release but also combustion reaction rate has to be introduced into the prediction of gas deflagrations. Using this concept, a modified scale model to predict the blast-wave intensity was developed by improving the previous scale model introducing the term of combustion reaction rate as burning velocity. Furthermore, scale analysis was performed to develop the new scaling law. The universal relationship between scaled distance and overpressure has been realized by this new scaling law for gas deflagrations. In summary, these results provide new methods for accurate prediction of the blast-wave intensity from gas deflagrations.",

Therefore in the present study we experimentally investigate the mechanism of the combustion wave transition to a detonation wave when there are no obstacles. In particular, we show that a local explosion near the tube wall is necessary for the initiation of a detonation. Parameters that we varied are the wall configuration, distance between the ignition point and the wall, and initial filling pressure. The combustion waves and the compression waves are visualized using the Schlieren optical system. From the results, we found it is necessary for the combustion wave to reach four walls so that the detonation could be initiated by the local explosion. In the conditions of the present experiment, we exhibited that the local explosion did not occur in the vicinity of a single wall and four orthogonal walls; instead, the local explosion occurred in a situation with five orthogonal walls. The time of the local explosion and the detonation initiation is 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 and 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 times the characteristic time for the combustion wave to propagate hemispherically from an ignitor and reach the four walls.",

Five combustion regimes could be observed about the projectile ranging from a prompt and delayed oblique detonation wave formation, combustion instabilities, a wave splitting, and an inert shock wave. The two theoretical limits provide a means to interpret the observed flowfield regimes and are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results.",

Accumulated gases in BWRs are stoichiometric hydrogen/oxygen mixtures diluted with steam at 7\u00a0MPa.

Two test pieces are used, one is straight tube and the other is 90-degree bend. No initial pressure dependency in detonation wave behavior is observed in the experiments. However, in the straight tube tests, detonation velocities higher than theoretical values are measured when the initial pressures are greater than 2.3\u00a0MPa. This result is considered as attribution of real gas effect. In the 90-degree bend experiments, pressure time histories reveal pressure loads greater than the straight tube portion at two locations. One is a high pressure peak at the extrados of the bend and the other is a double pressure peak just downstream of the bend outlet. Second pressure peak just downstream of the bend outlet is due to transverse wave propagation. Additionally, the largest impulse is observed not at the extrados of the bend but at the intrados of bend outlet. These results show the importance of more investigations on transverse wave behaviors in failure potential evaluation.",

Results of NO-PLIF measurement and numerical simulation showed that, in the case without the incident shock wave, injected gas is seldom seen in the recirculation zone just downstream of the injection slot, while the injected gas with higher concentration is almost uniformly distributed in the recirculation zone when the incident shock wave is introduced downstream of the injection slot. Moreover, it was shown by the numerical simulations that the profiles of the local equivalence ratio is in the combustible range due to the enhanced entrainment of the airstream when the incident shock wave is introduced downstream of the injection slot. A large-scale recirculation in the direction parallel to the wall is generated by the three-dimensional flow effects, which enhances the mixing and extends the residence time in the recirculation zone in the case with incident shock wave downstream of the injection slot, the recirculation flow being confirmed successfully by PIV measurements as well. The results of three-dimensional reactive numerical simulations were in good agreement with the experimental flame-holding characteristics at a lower total temperature, which showed that flame-holding can be attained only when the incident shock wave was introduced downstream of the injection slot, confirming that the formation of three-dimensional and large-scale recirculation flow downstream of the injection slot enlarges the recirculation zone and enhances the mixing to produce the conditions for robust flame-holding.",

     "abstract": "Hydrogen is expected to be used as a clean energy carrier. However, when high-pressure hydrogen is suddenly released into the air through tubes, self-ignition can occur by a diffusion ignition mechanism. In this paper, the phenomena of self-ignition and flame propagation during the sudden release of high-pressure hydrogen were investigated experimentally. Experimental results show that self-ignition can occur when bursting pressure is sufficiently high in spite of the shortness of the tube. For example, self-ignition was observed at a bursting pressure as high as 23.5\u00a0MPa with 50\u00a0mm long tube. When self-ignition successfully occurs, a hydrogen jet flame is produced by the ignition. The flame is then stabilized at the tube outlet. From photodiode signals and flame images, the propagation of a flame inside the tube is confirmed and the flame is detected near the rupture disk as the bursting pressure increases. When the tube length is not long enough to produce self-ignition, a hydrogen flame is observed in the only boundary layer at the end of tube and it quenches after the flame exits the tube. Consequently, the formation of a complete flame across the tube is important to initiate self-ignition, which sustains a diffusion flame after jetting out of the tube into the air. Also, in order to establish a complete flame across the tube, it is necessary to have sufficient length such that the mixing region is generated by multi-dimensional shock\u2013shock interactions.",

Fuel was injected through three sonic injectors in the recirculation region behind a backward-facing step: a parallel injector at 2\u00a0mm from the bottom wall and two normal injectors at 2 and 9\u00a0mm from the step wall. In order to mitigate the combustion pressure interaction with nozzle, an isolator was installed between the nozzle and combustor. The combustion performance of normal injection was little affected by the difference of fuel injection locations. Moreover, normally injected fuel was escaped not to be held in the recirculation region despite of low fuel injection rates. This led to lower combustion performance relative to the parallel injection which provided fuel not to leave the recirculation region. In this case, the role of the recirculation region was to fully hold fuel, and the PJ torch provided hot gases as a heat source and acted as a flame-holder to ignite fuel\u2013air mixtures. In a low temperature inflow condition, combustible regions were constrained around the bottom wall where embedded with the PJ torch. When thermal choking occurred in the combustor, it induced shock train both in the combustor and isolator.

This is because the normal injection led most fuel into low temperature incoming air-stream.",

Equilibrium calculations showed that the main species in high-temperature PJ, aside from N2, were H2, H, and HCN. Considering the slight impact of the HCN species on ignition delay time, the combustion enhancement by the N2/CH4 PJ was caused primarily by the existence of a large amount of H and H2 dissociated from CH4 molecules in the PJ.

The Mach number and total pressure of main flow in the combustor are 2.0 and 0.38\u00a0MPa, respectively, and the total temperature is varied from 1800 to 2400\u00a0K. Five kinds of n-alkane fuels such as n-heptane, n-octane, n-decane, n-tridecane and n-hexadecane are employed in experiments. Fuels are injected with a carrier nitrogen gas perpendicular to the mail flow in the combustor and the self-ignition behavior is investigated. The results show that the liquid fuels with lower carbon number have better self-ignition performance. This suggests that physical properties of liquid fuels such as volatility have a dominant effect on the self-ignition. The flame-holding behavior is investigated with the addition of pilot hydrogen to carrier nitrogen gas. The critical equivalence ratio at which the stable combustion keeps after cut-off of the pilot hydrogen is obtained. The relationship between the critical equivalence ratio and carbon number of fuel shows that fuels with the carbon numbers from 8 to 10 have the best flame-holding performance among the tested fuels. These experimental results can be expressed qualitatively by the simplified analysis with the concept of physical and chemical induction times.",

     "abstract": "The development of novel air-breathing engines such as supersonic combustion ramjets (scramjets) depends on the understanding of supersonic mixing, self-ignition and combustion. These aerothermochemical processes occur together in a scramjet engine and are notoriously difficult to understand. In the present study, we aim at analyzing the HyShot II scramjet combustor mounted in the High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel G\u00f6ttingen (HEG) by using Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models with detailed and reduced chemistry. To account for the complicated flow in the HEG facility a zonal approach is adopted in which RANS is used to simulate the flow in the HEG nozzle and test-section, providing the necessary inflow boundary conditions for more detailed RANS and LES of the reacting flow in the HyShot combustor. Comparison of predicted wall pressures and heat fluxes with experimental data show good agreement, and in particular does the LES agree well with the experimental data. The LES results are used to elucidate the flow, mixing, self-ignition and subsequent combustion processes in the combustor. The combustor flow can be separated into the mixing zone, in which turbulent mixing from the jet-in-cross flow injectors dominates, the self-ignition zone, in which self-ignition rapidly takes place, and the turbulent combustion zone, located towards the end of the combustor, in which most of the heat release and volumetric expansion takes place. Self-ignition occurs at some distance downstream of the injectors, resulting in a distinct pressure rise further downstream due to the volumetric expansion as observed in the experiments. The jet penetration is about 30% of the combustor height and the combustion efficiency is found to be around 83%.",

     "abstract": "The medium-scale fire whirl was extensively investigated by experimental means, in order to establish correlations of the burning rate, flame height and flame temperature of fire whirl, and to clarify the difference between fire whirls and general pool fires. Experimental observations and data confirmed that a free burning fire whirl is a highly stable burning phenomenon with large quasi-steady periods. Burning rates of fire whirls depend on pool diameter similarly to those of general pool fires; however the transition turbulent burning occurs sooner as the pool diameter increases. The lip height seems to have little effect on the burning rate of fire whirls. The correlation H \u2217 = K \u00b7 ( Q \u02d9 \u2217 \u00b7 \u0393 \u2217 2 ) m was proposed to couple the height of fire whirl to the fire release rate and ambient circulation. It correlates the data from both this work and the literature. Radial temperature profiles in the continuous region of the fire whirl were confirmed to be hump-type, implying the existence of fuel-rich inner core. The pool diameter and heat release rate do not significantly affect the radial temperature profiles in non-dimensional radial coordinates. It was found that the fire plume of fire whirl involves three distinct zones just like that of pool fire, but with different normalized ranges. Fire whirls maintain a higher ratio of continuous flame height to the overall flame height, and also higher maximum centerline excess temperature in continuous flame region, as compared to general pool fires. It was further demonstrated that the fire whirl plume at its origin behaves like a turbulent jet with moderate swirling, and then tends to become buoyancy dominated downstream, with slight swirling. With an increase in dimensionless height adjusted by the plume origin, the plume centerline excess temperature decays rapidly and approaches the theoretical value of \u22125/3 for free buoyancy plume.",

The results contradict the common notion of buoyancy being significant for the structure of the whirl, implying that strong fire whirls instead are dominated by rotation only, even if their axis is vertical.

     "abstract": "This paper discusses why the visibly-determined flame length of a weak fire whirl increases as compared with the corresponding pool fire without spin. Here, a fire whirl is called weak when the pure aerodynamic effect of flow circulation has a negligible influence on the flame length. Split cylinders were used to apply a flow circulation to a 3-cm-diameter methane burner flame and a 3-cm-diameter ethanol pool fire. After applying the flow circulation, the flame length of the ethanol pool fire increased about three times, while little change was observed in the flame length of the methane burner flame. The difference is explained by the fact that the burning rate of the methane burner flame was fixed constant, whereas that of the ethanol pool fire increased due to the increased heat input to the fuel surface caused by a change in flame shape pushed toward the fuel surface. The experimental observations thus demonstrate that the burning-rate effect can significantly increase the flame length even under a weak circulation condition. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to understand the detailed flow structure of a fire whirl. An analytical model was then developed based on the experimental observations and CFD calculations; the predicted relationship between the flame height and the burning rate agreed with experimental data.",

Comparison in forced concurrent flow in microgravity shows correct trends. The predicted steady spread rates are lower than the experimental ones if the flames are short but higher than the experimental ones if the flames are long.

     "abstract": "We have investigated the downward flame spread over a thin solid fuel. Hydrogen, methane, or propane, included in the gaseous product of pyrolysis reaction, is added in the ambient air. The fuel concentration is kept below the lean flammability limit to observe the partially premixing effect. Both experimental and numerical studies have been conducted. Results show that, in partially premixed atmospheres, both blue flame and luminous flame regions are enlarged, and the flame spread rate is increased. Based on the flame index, a so-called triple flame is observed. The heat release rate ahead of the original diffusion flame is increased by adding the fuel, and its profile is moved upstream. Here, we focus on the heat input by adding the fuel in the opposed air, which could be a direct factor to intensify the combustion reaction. The dependence of the flame spread rate on the heat input is almost the same for methane and propane/air mixtures, but larger effect is observed for hydrogen/air mixture. Since the deficient reactant in lean mixture is fuel, the larger effect of hydrogen could be explained based on the Lewis number consideration. That is, the combustion is surely intensified for all cases, but this effect is larger for lean hydrogen/air mixture (Le\u00a0<\u00a01), because more fuel diffuses toward the lean premixed flame ahead of the original diffusion flame. Resultantly, the pyrolysis reaction is promoted to support the higher flame spread rate.",

     "abstract": "Flame spread route in fire strongly depends on distribution of combustible materials. Two types of scenario are considered in flame spread when combustible materials randomly distributed; one case is that flame spreads and combustible materials burn out, and the other case is that flame self-extinguishes on the way. The threshold of burning out or self-extinguishing may be determined by quantity of combustible materials and their placement in space. Our objectives are to clarify the characteristics and threshold of flame spread. In this paper, we examine non-uniform flame spread in open air along a thin combustible solid with randomly distributed pores, which are considered as noncombustible space. Experimental results show that the flame spread rate for S\u00a0\u2266\u00a01 (S\u00a0\u2261\u00a0d/Lh, S: scale ratio, d: pore-scale, Lh: pre-heat length ahead of flame leading edge measured by using a shadowgraph method) increases with increasing the porosity and reaches maximum value approximately at 20\u201330% of porosity, while the flame spread rate for S\u00a0>\u00a01 is almost constant. Over 40% of porosity, the flame spread rate for both S\u00a0\u2266\u00a01 and S\u00a0>\u00a01 decreases. The flame cannot spread and completely self-extinguish over 60% of porosity independently with pore-scale and shape. The threshold of flame spread is related with the average-number of slit, Ns, which is made by connecting each pores. The Ns as the threshold of flame spread is unity for S\u00a0>\u00a01, while the modified average-number of slit (Ns\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0S) becomes two for S\u00a0\u2266\u00a01.",

The model considers a laminar diffusion flame in a uniform opposed flow and is based on the solution of the two-dimensional gas phase species and energy equations carried out early by the author. The solid phase energy equation is one-dimensional and coupled to the gas phase. Under some standard assumptions, the solution of this problem has been derived, from which it follows that the analytical dependence of non-dimensional flame-spread rate on the properties of components when the heat transfers via the solid phase is considerable. Main tendencies of the flame-spread process have been discovered and analyzed for two limiting cases. In the first one, when the flame size is large and due to this there is the strong heat flow going through the solid phase into a longitudinal direction, the spread rate rises considerably with the thermal conductivity of solid phase. In the second case, when the flame size and the heat flow from the flame into the solid phase are relatively small, the spread rate decreases with the thermal conductivity of solid phase due to the convective heat loss from the preheating zone into the gas flow. On the achievement of the critical conditions, the flame spread ceases. On the basis of the theory developed some explanations of the main feature of the flame-spread process over thin fuel/inert sheet are given and the generalization of available experimental data of the flame-spread rate has been carried out.",

Simultaneous measurements of vertical distributions of velocity and temperature were also conducted with conventional vent flow techniques, bi-directional probes and thermocouples. Correction factors for mass flow rate computations using the conventional techniques were determined based on comparisons to the SPIV results. An average correction factor of unity was determined for the bi-directional probe technique thus further confirming the utilization of velocity distributions acquired using the technique in mass flow rate computations. An average correction factor of 0.69 was determined for mass flow rates computed from vertical temperature distributions inside and outside the enclosure. This agrees with average correction factors determined in previous studies.

The attachment point was found to depend on the aspect ratio of the wick.

With slight adjustment to a constant, the width of the flame was well predicted, and the prediction for the flame height was about 60% too high and offset.

     "abstract": "The minimum extinguishing concentration (MEC) of a fire suppression agent is usually determined by the standard cup-burner tests. Recently, a simple model based on extinction of Perfectly Stirred Reactors (PSR) was developed and validated in the prediction of the MECs for inert fire suppressants. The results show good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the MECs of inert agents are directly correlated to agent integrated heat capacities. In this paper, the model is extended to halogenated agents by adding detailed chemical kinetics of the halogenated agents to a detailed chemical mechanism of n-heptane. The consideration of reactive halogenated species as fire suppression agents increases the complexity in computing the stoichiometry, yet the use of the PSR approach simplifies interpretations relative to 1-d and 2-d simulations. Using this approach, the MEC of halogenated agents are computed and compared against experimental data. Two methods of computation were employed. In the first, \u201cinert PSR\u201d case, only the heptane reaction chemistry was included; so the agent acts solely as an inert and the solution provides a reference point for expected behavior if the agent acted as an inert. In the second, or \u201creactive PSR\u201d case, agent-related chemistry was included. Good agreement is achieved for Halon 1301 (CF3Br) and R-32 (CH2F2). The computed \u201cinert PSR\u201d values agreed very well with the experimental MEC data for most fluorinated agents, suggesting that chemical inhibition by these fluorinated agents is counter-balanced by the exothermic HF formation and some competing chemical reactions; thus the \u201cnet\u201d inhibition is small. In contrast, the \u201creactive PSR\u201d results show good agreement with brominated agents and are consistent with the known strong catalytic effect of such compounds. The causes for differences between experiment and predicted values are explored and discussed while strengths and limitations are considered.",

In the PSR-based approach, both thermal (heat absorption) and chemical mechanisms of fire suppression can be captured. The assumed perfect mixing, on the other hand, prevents the ability to capture transport related mechanisms. In past work, the PSR approach using detailed chemistry was demonstrated to be effective in reproducing the MEC albeit with the need of single point calibration. The closed form solution presented herein becomes possible when the detailed chemistry is simplified to a single step, mole preserving chemical reaction. At the core of the model is an analytical expression for the extinction temperature which is transcendental and thus requires a numerical iterative solution. The analytical model is first verified using a traditional computational PSR (CHEMKIN package) that employs the same reduced kinetics as the analytical model. Subsequently, results from the analytical model are contrasted to those from a traditional PSR with detailed chemistry, from a semi-analytical approach that assumes heat absorption by the agent is the primary extinguishing mechanism, and from experimental data of various research groups. Good agreement is achieved validating the analytical model as a simple and accurate approach to determine the MEC. The analytical model is also used in a parametric assessment of the impact of geographic altitude (i.e. effect of ambient pressure) on the MEC and results are in good agreement with those of a traditional PSR with detailed chemistry.",

In this paper, we review the current state of knowledge of the fundamental sooting processes, including the chemistry of soot precursors, particle nucleation and mass/size growth. The discussion shows that though much progress has been made, critical gaps remain in many areas of our knowledge. We propose the roles of certain aromatic radicals resulting from localized \u03c0 electron structures in particle nucleation and subsequent mass growth. The existence of these free radicals provides a rational explanation for the strong binding forces needed for forming initial clusters of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. They may also explain a range of currently unexplained sooting phenomena, including the large amount of aliphatics observed in nascent soot formed in laminar premixed flames and the mass growth of soot in the absence of gas-phase H atoms. While the above suggestions are inspired, to an extent, by recent theoretical findings from the materials research community, this paper also demonstrates that the knowledge garnered through our longstanding interest in soot formation may well be carried over to flame synthesis of functional nanomaterials for clean and renewable energy applications. In particular, work on flame-synthesized thin films of nanocrystalline titania illustrates how our combustion knowledge might be useful for developing advanced yet inexpensive thin-film solar cells and chemical sensors for detecting gaseous air pollutants.",

In particular, three-dimensional DNS, at moderate Reynolds numbers and with complex chemistry, is providing unprecedented levels of detail to isolate and reveal fundamental causal relationships between turbulence, mixing and reaction. This information is leading to new physical insight, providing benchmark data for assessing model assumptions, suggesting new closure hypotheses, and providing interpretation of statistics obtained from lower-dimensional measurements. In this paper the various roles of petascale DNS are illustrated through selected examples related to lifted flame stabilization, premixed and stratified flame propagation in intense turbulence, and extinction and reignition in turbulent non-premixed jet flames. Extending the DNS envelope to higher Reynolds numbers, higher pressures, and greater chemical complexity will require exascale computing in the next decade. The future outlook of DNS in terms of challenges and opportunities in this regard are addressed.",

Samples were extracted at a residence time of 120\u00a0ms and stable intermediates were analyzed utilizing a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector coupled to a mass spectrometer. While a range of species were observed, a significant portion of n-dodecane decomposition was attributed to a select few species. These major carbon contributing intermediates included carbon oxides (CO and CO2), light aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and propanal), C12 alkylated tetrahydrofurans (2-propyl-5-iso-pentyltetrahydrofuran and two other incompletely identified isomers), lactones (5-methyl-dihydro-2(3H)-furanone and dihydro-2(3H)-furanone), and alkenes (ethene and 3-dodecene). The experimental results were compared to two kinetic models. The models captured the NTC behavior; however, discrepancies in measured formaldehyde, several light unsaturated species, and carbon monoxide indicate areas for model improvement. In the low temperature branching pathway from Livermore, a reaction path was identified (hydrogen abstraction from a secondary carbon followed by molecular oxygen addition and then internal hydrogen shift from the primary carbon) which would, if more active, predict the measured intermediate species. The data from this study provide targets for the continued refinement of kinetic models for n-dodecane.",

     "abstract": "Shock tube measurements of ignition delay times with high activation energies are strongly sensitive to variations in reflected shock temperatures. At longer shock tube test times, as are needed at low reaction temperatures, small gradual increases in pressure (and simultaneous increases in temperature) that result from incident shock wave attenuation and boundary layer growth can significantly shorten measured ignition delay times. To obviate this pressure increase, we made use of a recently developed driver-insert method of Hong et al. [8] that allows generation of near-constant-volume test conditions for reflected shock measurements. Using this method, we have measured propane ignition delay times in a lean mixture (0.8% C3H8/8% O2/Ar) over temperatures between 980 and 1400\u00a0K and nominal pressures of 6, 24 and 60\u00a0atm, under both conventional shock tube operation (with post-shock fractional pressure variation dP5/dt\u00a0\u223c\u00a01\u20137%/ms) and near-constant-volume operation (with dP5/dt\u00a0\u223c\u00a00%/ms). The near-constant-volume ignition delay times provide a database for low-temperature propane model development that is independent of non-ideal fluid flow and heat transfer effects. Comparisons of these near-constant-volume measurements with predictions using the JetSurF v1.0 mechanism of Sirjean et al. [10] and the Curran et al. mechanism of NUI Galway [5] were performed. Ignition delay times measured with dP5/dt\u00a0\u223c\u00a01\u20137%/ms were found to be significantly shorter (about 1/3 of the near-constant-volume values) at the lowest temperatures and highest pressures studied. However, these ignition times are successfully simulated using the JetSurF v1.0 mechanism when an appropriate gasdynamic model that accounts for changes in pressure and temperature is used.",

High-level ab initio calculations of the C3H5OOH and C3H5O potential energy surfaces are coupled with RRKM master equation methods to compute the temperature- and pressure-dependence of the rate coefficients. Variable reaction coordinate transition state theory is used to characterize the barrierless transition states for the allyl\u00a0+\u00a0HO2 and C3H5O\u00a0+\u00a0OH reactions. The predicted rate coefficients for allyl\u00a0+\u00a0HO2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0C3H5OOH\u00a0\u2192\u00a0products are in good agreement with experimental values.

     "abstract": "Reactions of hydrocarbon radicals with oxygen atoms are important in combustion, and both the rate coefficient and product branching have to be known for an accurate combustion modeling. In this work, the primary product formation in the reaction of the simplest open-chain secondary alkyl radical, iso-propyl (2-C3H7), with oxygen atoms in the gas phase was studied at room temperature and a pressure of 4\u00a0mbar. 2-C3H7 radicals were generated from diisopropylketone ((2-C3H7)2CO) and isopropyliodide (2-C3H7I), and O atoms were produced from SO2 by laser-flash photolysis at \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0193\u00a0nm, respectively. The reactants and products were detected by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. The combined product analysis in the experiments with the different precursors leads to the following relative branching fractions: 2-C3H7\u00a0+\u00a0O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0CH3CHO\u00a0+\u00a0CH3 (40%), CH3COCH3\u00a0+\u00a0H (36%), C3H6\u00a0+\u00a0OH (24%). The channel branching of the iso-propoxy (2-C3H7O) radical formed from the 2-C3H7\u00a0+\u00a0O reaction was modeled using statistical rate theory with molecular and transition state data from G3MP2B3 calculations. The absolute rate of reaction was studied at room temperature and a pressure of 5.8\u00a0mbar. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was used for the specific detection of the OH (v\u00a0=\u00a00,1) radicals, and the rate coefficient of the 2-C3H7\u00a0+\u00a0O reaction was derived from the OH (v\u00a0=\u00a01) LIF-time profile leading to k(2-C3H7\u00a0+\u00a0O)\u00a0=\u00a0(1.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01014\u00a0cm3/(mol\u00b7s) at 298\u00a0K. The OH-forming direct abstraction route and the channel to CH3CHO\u00a0+\u00a0CH3 may influence the flame speed of a propane flame. This is revealed, when the rate coefficient and channel branching of the 2-C3H7\u00a0+\u00a0O reaction is incorporated in a suitable detailed reaction mechanism and target experiments are modeled in absence and presence of the title reaction.",

The results are modeled with master-equation-based rate coefficients incorporated into a kinetic mechanism. Quantitative agreement can be obtained, providing experimental validation for the OH-producing pathways that are crucial for autoignition.

     "abstract": "The kinetics of the thermal decomposition of cyclopentyl radicals has been studied in a single-pulse shock tube over a temperature range of 950\u20131116\u00a0K and pressures of 2.3\u20133.4\u00a0bar. Cyclopentyl radicals were generated by abstraction of H from cyclopentane by H atoms, which were produced by the thermal decomposition of hexamethylethane. Products were analyzed using dual-column gas chromatography under cryogenic conditions with simultaneous flame-ionization and mass-spectrometric detection. The main stable products resulting from the decomposition of cyclopentyl radicals are ethene and cyclopentene. These results are consistent with the interconversion of cyclopentyl and pent-4-en-1-yl radicals. The product branching ratio of ethene to cyclopentene is determined as [ethene]/[cyclopentene]\u00a0=\u00a0(8.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7)exp[\u2212(1067\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088)/T), where the listed uncertainty (1\u03c3) is from the statistical analysis. The overall accuracy in our measurement of the branching ratio is estimated at about 8% (1\u03c3). In contrast to previous estimates, ring opening of cyclopentyl is found to be faster than ejection of a hydrogen atom. The former reaction is favored by about a factor of three. An RRKM/Master Equation treatment was adopted to assign the rate parameters to elementary reactions. Details of the model and its compatibility with the present and literature results are presented.

     "abstract": "A combination of global uncertainty screening and ab initio theoretical chemical kinetics is used to iteratively improve the mechanism of Li et al. [3] for the ignition of methanol at high pressure. The initial application of the screening analysis indicates that the CH3OH\u00a0+\u00a0HO2 reaction dominates the uncertainty in the predicted ignition delay for stoichiometric CH3OH combustion at 1100\u00a0K and 20\u00a0bar. The rate coefficients for both product channels (CH2OH\u00a0+\u00a0H2O2 and CH3O\u00a0+\u00a0H2O2) in this reaction are predicted with ab initio transition state theory employing barriers and rovibrational properties obtained at the CCSD(T)/CBS//CASPT2/cc-pvtz level. The estimated uncertainty in these predictions is a factor of 2. The second iteration of the screening analysis indicates that the CH3OH\u00a0+\u00a0O2 reaction next dominates the uncertainty in the ignition delay at high pressure. The associated rate coefficient is updated using a two transition state model that employs CCSD(T)/CBS//CASPT2/cc-pvtz properties for the tight transition state and direct CASPT2/aug-cc-pvdz based variable reaction coordinate transition state theory for the barrierless formation of the long-range CH2OH\u00a0\u2026\u00a0HO2 complex. The final predictions for the ignition delay are a factor of 4 greater than those with the original model and the width of the distributions of ignition delay relative to its peak value decreases by a factor of 3. Further reduction in the uncertainty will require more accurate predictions for the CH3OH\u00a0+\u00a0HO2 reaction and new predictions for the HO2\u00a0+\u00a0HO2 reaction.

Conditions behind the reflected shock are approximately between 10\u201342\u00a0bar and 770\u20131250\u00a0K. To our knowledge, the ignition delay measurements of butanol at these high pressures are the first of their kind. CH emission and pressure time histories have been probed to determine ignition delay times for all experiments. For stoichiometric fuel\u2013air-mixtures the influence of the temperature and pressure has been characterized. Interestingly the experimental data deviate from the Arrhenius behavior for temperatures lower than 1000\u00a0K. This is in contrast to simulation results which have been obtained by employing the simulation tool CANTERA with different reaction mechanisms applying the typical assumption of isochoric conditions. It has been found out that a positive pressure and temperature gradient behind the reflected shock has a significant influence on the ignition delay below 1000\u00a0K causing a pronounced decrease in the ignition delay times. This change of the conditions behind the reflected shock is attributed to the shock attenuation and probably from pre-ignition. Including the measured pressure gradients and assuming an isentropic compression behind the reflected shock, the simulation data and the experimental results show a same trend in the temperature dependence of the ignition delay. Nevertheless, striking differences between experiment and simulation persist especially for higher pressures. By performing sensitivity analysis at different temperatures some critical reactions could be identified and their role under our experimental conditions is discussed. In summary it can be stated that the employed reaction mechanisms may not be fully applicable to high-pressure conditions and it seems plausible that the lack of more detailed low temperature fuel specific reactions could be the probable cause for the discrepancies which calls for detailed investigations at elevated pressures.",

With a Pt\u20136%Rh/Pt\u201330%Rh thermocouple, the flame temperature profiles were measured. A detailed kinetic mechanism with 88 species and 701 reactions was proposed and validated against experimental results of all three flames.

     "abstract": "Autoignition delay times of stoichiometric methane, ethane and methane/ethane mixtures doped with 100 and 270\u00a0ppm of NO2 have been measured in a RCM in the temperature range 900\u20131050\u00a0K and pressures from 25 to 50\u00a0bar. The measurements show that addition of NO2 to CH4/O2/N2/Ar and CH4/C2H6/O2/N2/Ar mixtures results in a significant reduction in the autoignition delay time and that the ignition-promoting effect of NO2 increases substantially with increasing temperature, from \u223c20% to more than a factor of two over the range of temperature studied. Addition of NO2 to C2H6/O2/N2/Ar mixtures results in only a modest reduction in ignition delay time over the range of pressure and temperature measured. Computations with an updated chemical mechanism show good agreement with the measurements for undoped methane, but overpredict the delay times for undoped ethane and underestimate the effects of replacing 10% methane by ethane. For NO2-containing mixtures, the model predicts the observed trend in decreasing delay time with increasing NO2 fraction. However, the computations tend to overestimate the effect of NO2 addition on ignition, particularly for C2H6 mixtures. Analysis of the reaction mechanism for the effects of NO2 addition to methane mixtures indicates that the ignition-promoting effect of NO2 is related to the appearance of new conversion channels for CH3 and CH3OO, i.e., NO2\u00a0+\u00a0CH3\u00a0\u2192\u00a0NO\u00a0+\u00a0CH3O and NO\u00a0+\u00a0CH3OO\u00a0\u2192\u00a0NO2\u00a0+\u00a0CH3O, generation of chain-initiating OH radicals through NO/NO2 interconversion, i.e., NO2\u00a0+\u00a0H\u00a0\u2192\u00a0NO\u00a0+\u00a0OH and NO\u00a0+\u00a0HO2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0NO2\u00a0+\u00a0OH, and to the direct initiation step CH4\u00a0+\u00a0NO2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0CH3\u00a0+\u00a0HNO2. Analyses further show that the formation of CH3NO2 via CH3\u00a0+\u00a0NO2(+M)\u00a0\u2194\u00a0CH3NO2(+M) essentially inactivates NO2. This reaction limits the promoting effect of NO2 at lower temperatures and higher pressures, where stabilization of CH3NO2 is favored, explaining the experimentally observed trends.",

     "abstract": "It has long been recognised that nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can promote the oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons under various fuel-lean and fuel-rich conditions and a range of temperatures and pressures conditions. However, despite the ease with which NO and NO2 interconvert under the oxidation conditions, the reactions responsible for initiating the oxidation process for methane are different. This is demonstrated experimentally by the different temperature characteristics of the sensitised reaction and supported by kinetic modelling. In this study, the effect of NO/NO2-sensitised oxidation of methane was experimentally studied with two fuel-lean mixtures, viz. 2.5% methane-in-air and 0.05% methane-in-air mixtures, at atmospheric pressure, over temperature ranges of 823\u2013948\u00a0K, and 873\u20131023\u00a0K, respectively. Kinetic modelling of the experimental results showed satisfactory agreement and an exhaustive sensitivity analysis was conducted. It was shown through brute-force sensitivity analysis that the difference in key reactions in both NO and NO2 system leads to the observed trend: the effect of NO starts at lower temperatures while NO2 appears to be more potent at higher temperatures. Another salient point emerging from the sensitivity analysis is that the initiation reaction in NO-promoted system was identified to be CH3O2\u00a0+\u00a0NO\u00a0=\u00a0CH3O\u00a0+\u00a0NO2; for NO2-sensitised case, CH4\u00a0+\u00a0NO2\u00a0=\u00a0CH3\u00a0+\u00a0HONO is the most important initiator at lower temperatures while NO2\u00a0+\u00a0O\u00a0=\u00a0NO\u00a0+\u00a0O2 and NO2\u00a0+\u00a0HO2\u00a0=\u00a0HONO\u00a0+\u00a0O2 appear to be of prime importance at higher temperatures.",

The main reaction pathways of the C2H4/O2/NOx conversion, the capacity of C2H4 to remove NO, and the influence of the presence of NOx on the C2H4 oxidation are analyzed. Compared to the C2H4/O2 system, the presence of NOx shifts the onset of reaction 75\u2013150\u00a0K to lower temperatures. The mechanism of sensitization involves the reaction HOCH2CH2OO\u00a0+\u00a0NO\u00a0\u2192\u00a0CH2OH\u00a0+\u00a0CH2O\u00a0+\u00a0NO2, which pushes a complex system of partial equilibria towards products. This is a confirmation of the findings of Doughty et al. [3] for a similar system at atmospheric pressure. Under reducing conditions and temperatures above 700\u00a0K, a significant fraction of the NOx is removed. This removal is partly explained by the reaction C2H3\u00a0+\u00a0NO\u00a0\u2192\u00a0HCN\u00a0+\u00a0CH2O. However, a second removal mechanism is active in the 700\u2013850\u00a0K range, which is not captured by the chemical kinetic model. With the present thermochemistry and kinetics, neither formation of nitro-hydrocarbons (CH3NO2, C2H3NO2, C2H5NO2, CHOCH2NO2) nor nitroso-compounds (CH3NO, C2H3NO, C2H5NO, ONCH2CHO, CH3C(O)NO, ONCH2CH2OH) contribute to remove NOx.",

A previously published pyrolysis mechanism has been updated and extended to include kinetics of the partially oxidized intermediates. The new mechanism still reproduces the previously reported experimental pyrolysis results satisfactorily and provides reasonable agreement with experimental measurements for the present oxidation conditions.

In computational work that addresses turbulent combustion or the transition from deflagration to detonation, however, autoignition and flames both may occur, and reduced chemistry may be required because of computer limitations. To fill that need, systematically reduced chemistry is presented here that encompasses autoignition and flames. The description involves three global steps among five reacting species, H 2 , O 2 , H 2 O,H and HO 2 , being based on approximations to chemical-kinetic steady states for O, OH and H 2 O 2 . These steady states apply well under all conditions except during autoignition in lean and stoichiometric mixtures, where they underpredict induction times substantially. To remedy this deficiency, which occurs only when HO 2 is not in steady state, an autoignition analysis is employed to derive a correction factor that reduces the value of the reaction rates to produce agreement of calculated ignition delays. Introduction of a criterion for inclusion of this correction factor, based on a test for the HO 2 steady state, results in a generally applicable three-step chemical-kinetic description for hydrogen\u2013air combustion that possesses reasonable accuracy for most computational purposes.",

Analysis of the 1000-\u00b0C reaction products of propyne \u2013 by high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode-array ultraviolet-visible absorbance detection \u2013 has led to the identification of 58 two- to eight-ring PAH that have never before been reported as products of propyne pyrolysis or combustion. At all temperatures except 1000\u00a0\u00b0C, however, propyne-only pyrolysis produces very low yields of PAH \u2013 a consequence of low propyne (and propadiene) conversion and high production of benzene, which remains relatively invulnerable to ring-growth reactions.

The 1- and 2-ring aromatic hydrocarbon product distribution also shifts from one dominated by unreactive benzene to one having more substituted species, more reactive to ring-growth.

     "abstract": "The effects of pressure on soot formation and flame structure were studied experimentally and numerically in coflow ethylene\u2013air laminar diffusion flames between 10 and 35\u00a0atm. Reliable measurements up to 35\u00a0atm were permitted by diluting the fuel with nitrogen and suppressing smoke formation. These measurements were compared with numerical predictions to assess the accuracy of current soot models applied to high pressure diffusion flames. The numerical framework used in the present work represents the current state of the art in computational modelling, making use of a block-based parallel implicit finite-volume scheme and detailed radiation heat transfer. In the current implementation, a semi-empirical acetylene-based model is used to predict the nucleation, growth, and oxidation of soot particles. Although the soot model is based on experimental data at atmospheric pressure, it correctly predicted many of the observed trends with pressure. A narrowing flame with constant height was observed as pressure was increased in both the experiments and numerical results. The model also captured the observed relationship between the maximum amount of carbon converted to soot and pressure, although soot volume fractions were generally over-predicted everywhere in the flames. In both the experiments and predictions, soot volume fractions increased with pressure while the tendency of the fuel to produce more soot declined as pressure was increased. Interestingly, the calculations predicted soot inside the fuel tube at 20\u00a0atm whose concentrations increased with pressure. An analysis of the numerical results concluded that this early appearance of soot was attributed to fuel pyrolysis inside the tube which accelerated as pressure was increased from 10 to 35\u00a0atm.",

     "abstract": "Existing soot models for non-premixed ethylene/air flames often do not satisfactorily predict soot volume fraction. Due to intense energy exchange by radiative heat transfer, this leads to a situation where even basic scalar fields like temperature are inaccurately described. The objective of the present study is to develop an enhanced soot prediction model for such flames, valid for a wide range of flow and operating conditions. The emphasis in this work is specifically on the particulate phase and not on kinetics. Therefore, gas-phase chemistry is simply modeled with a mixture fraction approach combined with equilibrium chemistry, while turbulence\u2013chemistry interactions are taken into account by a presumed \u03b2-PDF. The evolution of soot particles is described by physical models accounting for nucleation, surface growth, aggregation and oxidation. The Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM) is employed to solve the Population Balance Equations (PBE) in a computationally efficient manner, assuming a mono-variate PBE with particle diameter as internal coordinate. The original soot model is optimized numerically by using Genetic Algorithms coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The values of three model parameters, associated with nucleation, oxidation and soot particle radiation are optimized through comparison with recent experimental results. Two objective functions are formulated based on the difference between experimental and simulation results for temperature and soot volume fraction. After obtaining an optimal parameter set, the resulting model is further tested against three experimental configurations, leading to a good agreement and thus demonstrating a high level of generality.",

The selected fuel mass flow rate provided diffusion flames in which the soot was completely oxidized within the visible flame envelope and the flame was stable at all pressures considered. The spatially resolved soot volume fraction and soot temperature were measured by spectral soot emission as a function of pressure. The visible (luminous) flame height remained almost unchanged from 1.52 to 3.34\u00a0MPa, whereas it increased considerably from atmospheric to 1.52\u00a0MPa. Flame cross-sectional area, measured at the flame height of 5\u00a0mm either bounded by maximum flame temperature or maximum soot volume fraction contours, showed an inverse dependence on pressure. Peak carbon conversion to soot, defined as the percentage of fuel\u2019s carbon content converted to soot, showed a strong dependence on pressure at lower pressures; but this dependence grew weaker as the pressure was increased. This dependence can be expressed as a pressure scaling in the form of a power law. However, the exponent of pressure was not constant: it was about 2.2 for pressures between 0.2 and 0.51\u00a0MPa, about 1.1 for pressures between 0.51 and 1.52\u00a0MPa, and about 0.4 for pressures between 1.52 and 3.34\u00a0MPa. Averaged flame temperatures decreased with increasing pressure as a result of enhanced heat loss from the flame by soot radiation. The maximum temperature gradients increased with pressure at lower flame heights; at higher locations in the flame, after an initial increase at the lower pressure range, gradients reached a plateau at about 1.5\u20132.0\u00a0MPa.",

The numerical model uses a surrogate mixture, comprising 69% n-decane, 20% n-propylbenzene, and 11% n-propylcyclohexane (by mole).

The problem is intractable by serial processing; therefore, distributed-memory parallelization is used, employing 192 CPUs. Experimentally, soot volume fraction and gaseous species concentration profiles are determined by a Laser Extinction Measurement method and Gas Chromatography, respectively, in a coflow diffusion flame of vaporized Jet-A1. These data are used to validate the model. Centerline species concentrations are satisfactorily reproduced by the model.

Tested fuels were three binary mixtures from the primary reference fuels of n-heptane, iso-octane, and toluene. The result showed that PAH and soot maintained near zero level for all mixtures of n-heptane/iso-octane case under present experimental conditions. For n-heptane/toluene and iso-octane/toluene mixtures, PAH initially increased and then decreased with the toluene ratio, exhibiting a synergistic effect. The soot formation increased monotonically with the toluene ratio, however the effect of toluene on soot formation was minimal for relatively small toluene ratios. These results implied that even though toluene had a dominant role in soot and PAH formations, small amount of toluene had a minimal effect on soot formation. Numerical simulations have also been conducted by adopting recently proposed two kinetic mechanisms. The synergistic behavior of aromatic rings was predicted similar to the experimental PAH measurement, however, the degree of the synergistic effect was over-predicted for the soot formation flame, indicating the need for refinements in the kinetic mechanisms.",

Soot particle sizes were also measured from thermophoretically sampled soot particles analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results showed growing isolated primary soot particles up to a height of 10\u00a0mm, after which strong soot aggregation occurred and the increase in soot primary particle size ceased. The measured data was used in the evaluation of the soot absorption function, E(m), and a strong increase by a factor of two was observed from the lowest heights to the highest for assumed constant values of soot density and specific heat at all heights. By comparing the 2C-LII particle sizes with the sizes obtained from TEM, differences were observed. Part of the explanation is that the 2C-LII evaluation did not take aggregation into account, but it is additionally speculated that the thermal accommodation coefficient decreases with height above burner. These results are interesting in view of morphological and composition changes of the soot during the growth process and have implications for the use of 2C-LII as a soot diagnostic technique.",

It also enables investigation of second order 2D Raman bands in soot and soot precursors, providing complementary information to the first order Raman bands.Raman spectra, together with the measurement of particle size distribution by DMA, help to characterize particles produced across the soot threshold limit. Three particle modes have been identified: flames with C/O\u00a0<\u00a00.65 produce only modeI particles with a diameter of d\u00a0\u2248\u00a02\u00a0nm, which present the typical bands of amorphous carbon and have a very low, if any, three-dimensional ordering of graphitic planes. Other aromatic macromolecules smaller than the lower detection limit of the DMA (d\u00a0<\u00a01.5\u00a0nm) are present in the flame, and are collected by thermophoretic sampling. In flames with higher C/O ratio the size distribution becomes bimodal with the formation of modeII particles, d\u00a0\u2248\u00a04\u00a0nm. In non-sooting flames, the SERS spectra of modeI and modeII particles are similar except for features indicating the presence of a higher degree of disorder in modeII, likely due to distorted or five order rings.In soot-forming flames, larger modeIII particles collected with a diameter of 40\u00a0nm present a higher ordering and a reduction of graphitic interplane distance, which, nevertheless, still remains larger than 3.50\u00a0\u01fa.

Results for the leanest ethylene/air flame (\u03a6overall\u00a0=\u00a00.8), showed a decrease in particle mean diameter and an increase in particle number concentration for ultrafine-sized particles with increasing height above burner (HAB), which indicates fragmentation of the fine-sized particles. At higher HAB, the soot oxidation process was dominated by soot burnout as confirmed by the decrease in number and mass concentration. The fuel rich condition (\u03a6overall\u00a0=\u00a01.14) did not show particle fragmentation; in fact, the size distribution was governed by soot burnout starting at burner surface. Measurements of gas-phase compounds, O2, CO, CO2, H2, validated a detailed kinetic model, which was used to predict OH concentration in the secondary flame. Using the concentrations for O2 and OH, soot oxidation rates were calculated and compared with experimental data. Furthermore, the regions where O2 and OH were dominating the process of soot oxidation were identified. Soot oxidation via O2 was favored under fuel lean conditions close to the burner surface. Oxidation via OH appeared to be the major path for soot oxidation under near-stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions after O2 concentrations dropped, and faster soot oxidation rates were obtained.",

     "abstract": "While the formation and growth of soot particles has received much attention, the subsequent destruction of the particles is less well understood. Soot particles are destroyed though two parallel processes: oxidation and fragmentation. Oxidation is the removal of mass from particles due to chemical reactions with molecular oxygen and hydroxyl radicals. Fragmentation is the break-up of large aggregates into smaller aggregates. Here, a new model for fragmentation inspired by previous experimental investigations is proposed and formulated within the Hybrid Method of Moments (HMOM). With the formulation, the rate of particle loss due to oxidation is closed, resolving a long-standing problem with the Method of Moments. Less important, secondary unclosed terms are introduced, and models for these terms are proposed. The oxidation and fragmentation models are validated using a set of laminar premixed methane flames and then applied to a series of laminar counterflow diffusion acetylene flames. The role of fragmentation is distinctly different in the two flame types. In the premixed flames, fragmentation only occurs in lean flames with a high oxygen concentration. In the diffusion flames, fragmentation is virtually absent, for soot passes through an OH radical layer and is completely oxidized before reaching high oxygen concentrations.",

     "abstract": "Soot nucleation bridges the transition from gaseous hydrocarbons to macromolecular building blocks (nanoparticles) that eventually turn into soot. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) have often been invoked as important compounds of this process but their role has not been clearly identified. In this paper we report on a detailed analysis of the physical interactions between PAH in the range 200\u2013450\u00a0amu using Molecular Dynamics simulations. In particular, we identified a pool of nine aromatics and studied their clustering behaviors in systems composed of thousands of homo-molecular and hetero-molecular molecules to understand the influence of molecular mass, morphology and temperature on the nucleation process. At temperatures higher than 1000\u00a0K, small clusters of PAH (2\u20135 molecules) are detected but they are not stable enough to accommodate the further growth into larger particles. This result raises doubts on the ability of these molecules to become soot nuclei. Molecular morphology is another important parameter for the nucleation process. Aromatics with attached aliphatic chains show considerably faster nucleation rates than the corresponding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of similar mass without any chain. The collision efficiency is not increased by the aliphatic chain attachments, which may indicate that a faster nucleation process for these systems is due to the ability of these molecules to accommodate the collision energy into additional internal vibrational modes of the aliphatic chains. The results of this study provide information on the clustering behavior of PAH and can lead to the development of a more complex model to describe the physical nucleation of PAH that includes molecular masses, morphologies and temperature as main parameters to describe the transition from gas-phase species to macromolecular structures.",

The laboratory-scale apparatus consisted of a pesticide vaporiser, a tubular reactor and a product sampling system. The sampling train comprised tandem XAD-2 resin cartridges to trap PCDD/F as well as an activated charcoal tube to capture the organic volatile compounds (VOC). The analyses of PCDD/F were conducted by means of high resolution gas chromatograph (HRGC) \u2013 ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS) and analyses of VOC by HRGC \u2013 quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). Substantially more PCDF formed than PCDD in the oxidative pyrolysis of captan, with higher yield of total PCDD/F observed at longer residence time. As indicated by the homologue distribution of PCDD/F, only mono to tetra chlorinated congeners were detected in our measurements, with 4-monochlorinated dibenzofuran (4-MCDF) ranking as the most abundant congener. The results of VOC analysis revealed benzene and chlorinated benzenes as important PCDD/F precursors. Combining the experimental measurements and the results of quantum chemical calculations, we established the reaction pathways for formation of PCDD/F from the vapour-phase oxidative pyrolysis of this widely employed fungicide.",

At this wavelength, there is minimal interference from water absorption at combustion temperatures and pressures, even for water levels that are more than two orders of magnitude larger than the H2O2 concentration. For obtaining a calibration of the laser absorption technique, a robust method of hydrogen peroxide delivery was employed so that a standard H2O2\u2013H2O mixture could be used as the source, but with high certainty as to the initial concentration of H2O2. The initial amount of hydrogen peroxide was measured using a water absorption laser diagnostic to measure the water concentration in conjunction with the known thermodynamics of the vapor mixture, highly diluted in argon. Measurements were made with argon as the bath gas at temperatures ranging from 292 to 1296\u00a0K and a pressure range of 0.05\u20131.43\u00a0atm, resulting in a calibration for the absorption coefficient of H2O2 at 7845.63\u00a0nm.

The non-intrusive sensor is based on fixed-wavelength laser absorption of methane near 1.65\u00a0\u03bcm using a single fiber-coupled diode laser. This CH4 absorption wavelength is free of interference from the absorption of other species in air. Wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) is combined with second-harmonic detection to improve the sensor sensitivity and accuracy. WMS-1f signal is used to normalize the 2f signal to remove the need for calibration and account for the laser transmission variations in gas turbine combustors. The near-IR TDL sensor is first calibrated in a static cell with CH4 and N2 mixture to determine the line-strength and find the laser setpoint. Test with a gas turbine combustor operating at atmospheric pressure is then conducted to demonstrate the sensor accuracy and response time. The TDL sensor is used to characterize equivalence ratio fluctuations in the combustor before the fuel/air mixtures enter the combustion chamber. The gain between heat release and equivalence ratio fluctuation is measured when the fuel flow rate is modulated at different levels. The combustion test results demonstrate the utility of the TDL sensor as a useful diagnostic tool to study flame characteristics and evaluate different combustor designs.",

A calibrated spectrometer system was used for the data acquisition of the radiation intensity profile of a flame over a range of wavelengths (200\u20131100\u00a0nm). The wavelength range that meets the gray body assumption, in which the emissivity can be assumed to be constant, can be determined from the emissivity profile obtained by spectral analysis and the two-color method. Then the temperature and emissivity of the flame and their relative mean square deviations were calculated within that range. Experiments were conducted on solidified gasoline and red phosphorus flames, and pulverized coal-fired flames in a commercial 420\u00a0ton/h boiler furnace. The results show that the gasoline flame can be assumed to be a gray body in the range between 550 and 900\u00a0nm, for the coal-fired flame the range is between 500 and 1000\u00a0nm; while the red phosphorus flame cannot be assumed to be a gray body within the measurement wavelength range. The temperature and emissivity calculation results of coal-fired flames are found to be in reasonable agreement with results using other methods described in the literature.

The CTC sensor has been demonstrated for a methane\u2013oxygen Matrix burner consisting of 21 laminar diffusion jet flames using affordable commodity cameras.

Instantaneous 3-D reconstructions using 10 simultaneous camera measurements also show good agreement with the observed flame shape and are seen to be tolerant of error in the camera location. Measurements with exposure times as short as 62 \u03bc s were found to achieve more than sufficient signal-to-noise ratios for successful tomographic reconstructions.

These flames are well-documented in the literature and enable an evaluation of krypton as a tracer in different fuel mixtures with varying degrees of differential diffusion. Krypton is excited from the ground state to the 5p[3/2]2 state using 215\u00a0nm laser radiation, and the fluorescence decay to the metastable state, 5s[3/2]2, is detected at 760\u00a0nm.

Measurements of the temperature- and species-dependent quenching rates for Kr-LIF are incorporated into this routine.

This paper presents what the authors believe to be the first multi-frame, high-speed CH PLIF image sequences captured in a turbulent nonpremixed jet-flame. The high-repetition rate CH PLIF measurements were made using a combination of a custom pulse burst laser system operating at a 10-kHz repetition rate, an in-house optical parametric oscillator (OPO) with frequency mixing for 390-nm laser pulse generation, and a high-framing rate ICCD camera for high-speed image capture. The 1064-nm output of the pulse burst laser is frequency-tripled (355\u00a0nm) and used to pump the OPO, which can be operated in a narrow bandwidth (300\u00a0MHz) or broadband (4\u00a0cm\u22121) mode. The OPO system produces a burst of laser pulses near 615\u00a0nm, which can be subsequently mixed with residual 1064-nm output from the pulse burst laser to generate a series of 390-nm pulses separated by less than 100\u00a0\u03bcs. The tunable ultraviolet output around 390\u00a0nm is then used to excite the B\u2013X (0,\u00a00) band allowing high-speed image sequences of the CH radical to be acquired from the B\u2013X(0,\u00a01), A\u2013X(1,\u00a01), and A\u2013X(0,\u00a00) bands near 430\u00a0nm. In this paper, we present results using the narrow bandwidth mode of the laser. By injection seeding the OPO with a single-frequency diode laser, we can obtain spectrally-narrow output at 390-nm, which allows imaging of CH with only 0.4\u00a0mJ/pulse of laser energy. Ten-kilohertz-CH PLIF image sequences from a turbulent nonpremixed flame are reported as an example of the potential of this diagnostic system. Although, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is marginal, we discuss future improvements to the system to increase the SNR to levels comparable to that achieved with traditional low-repetition rate systems.",

The new developments to the technique reported here were essential to achieve the accuracy (\u00b141\u00a0K) and precision (\u00b18\u00a0K) required for useful measurements in such systems. This represents the first application of TLAF thermometry to the investigation of low-pressure sooting flames, an environment in which other thermometry techniques perform poorly. We thus demonstrate a practical application of diode laser TLAF to a burner that is the subject of a coordinated experimental and computational investigation of soot formation. The TLAF technique requires no calibration measurement and is compact and economical to set up in comparison with traditional laser thermometry methods. Temperature profiles were recorded in a laminar flat-flame operating on O2, N2 and CH4 at fuel equivalence ratio of 2.32 and pressures ranging from 18.7 to 26.7\u00a0kPa. Almost identical temperature profiles were observed at different pressures despite the fact that soot volume fractions changed by more than an order of magnitude between the lowest and highest operating pressures. The data will contribute to modelling efforts to understand the surprisingly strong dependence of soot volume fraction on pressure that has previously been observed under the range of conditions studied here and will be included in an openly available database on this flame, which includes species profile measurements obtained by other methods.

Subsequent spectral evaluation with commonly used N2\u2013N2 Raman line widths clearly underestimated the real temperatures. Inclusion of recently calculated N2\u2013H2 spectral line-broadening coefficients weighted by the concentration of hydrogen resulted in CARS temperatures in much better agreement with the true temperatures.

The validation experiments were repeated for binary mixtures of nitrogen and methane up to 500\u00a0K.

The corresponding range of the scattering wave vector limits the measured section of the overall structure factor significantly and makes an unambiguous determination of the size distribution parameters using relative multi-angle scatter intensities difficult. An interplay of the distribution width parameter and the fractal dimension is significant and impairs the possibilities for determining both properties simultaneously. The ambiguity of solutions can be overcome by including the absolute scattering intensity which is obtained via comparison with a known Rayleigh scatterer. However, additional parameters like the primary particle diameter, the soot volume fraction, the fractal prefactor, and the scattering function of the refractive index F(m) must be known with sufficient accuracy. We show how the analysis can be applied to a variety of soot sources ranging from very small aggregates in premixed flames, over intermediate aggregates in a laminar diffusion flame to large cooled soot emitted from a diffusion flame in inverted geometry.",

Similarly, quantitative determination of the optical depth can be particularly underestimated as a result of detecting photons which have experienced a number of scattering events. In this paper we demonstrate, based on average imaging, the possibility to reconstruct the \u201ctrue\u201d 3-D Mie representation of an aerated spray, where image artifacts introduced by multiple scattering have been suppressed by means of Structured Laser Illumination Planar Imaging (SLIPI). Here, six images were used, instead of three usually employed in structured illumination, to reconstruct a single SLIPI image. Based on a similar approach, a 2-D estimation of optical depth has been performed and compared with the conventional single-point attenuation measurement.",

     "abstract": "Current state of knowledge of laminar premixed flame propagation, dynamics and control is reviewed. A distinction is made between planar and multi-dimensional flames. Based on the well-established theory of flame propagation of free adiabatic flames, different mechanisms to control planar flames, mainly based on heat transfer processes in porous media, but also using electrical and gravitational fields, are considered. Flame instabilities, leading to flame pulsations or oscillations, for instance in an acoustic field, are also considered. A simple physical model for the interaction between a premixed flame and a burner is presented to explain the main physical mechanisms of planar instabilities of burner-stabilized flames. Knowledge on flame propagation of planar flames is well-established and physical models to describe the behavior of these flames are mature, although it is expected that more sophisticated methods will be used in future research to control their behavior.Multi-dimensional flames are also well understood, although the state of knowledge is less mature. Models for the interaction of flames with flow distortions, leading to flame stretch and curvature are derived. The influence of such distortions on the burning velocity and flame dynamics in terms of the Markstein number is studied. Weak-stretch models are available but multiple species chemistry and transport effects are less well understood, especially for rich and stoichiometric mixtures. Some ways to extend or improve current models are indicated. Current knowledge on the interaction of premixed (Bunsen-type) flames with flow distortions, such as acoustic waves, is also reviewed. Experimentally observed phenomena can be modeled satisfactory using detailed numerical models. However, for this research area, it is clear that current physical models or analytical descriptions are less mature because the origin of some phenomena is still largely unknown. Extensions of current (mostly G-equation like) models to account for flame\u2013flow interaction, flame\u2013flame interaction and flame\u2013burner interaction are needed. To conclude: a multiple set of measures to adapt the flames to the combustion system of interest is at hand and different ways to influence the flame by heat transfer, acoustic waves and other less often used control mechanisms like electric fields are available. This is needed to modify and control premixed laminar flames in practical devices to guarantee safe and proper operation.",

     "abstract": "Fundamental flame properties of mixtures of air with hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and C1\u2013C4 saturated hydrocarbons were studied both experimentally and numerically. The fuel mixtures were chosen in order to simulate alternative gaseous fuels and to gain insight into potential kinetic couplings during the oxidation of fuel mixtures. The studies included the use of the counterflow configuration for the determination of laminar flame speeds, as well as extinction and ignition limits of premixed flames. The experiments were modeled using the USC Mech II kinetic model. It was determined that when hydrocarbons are added to hydrogen flames as additives, flame ignition, propagation, and extinction are affected in a counterintuitive manner. More specifically, it was found that by substituting methane by propane or n-butane in hydrogen flames, the reactivity of the mixture is reduced both under pre-ignition and vigorous burning conditions. This behavior stems from the fact that propane and n-butane produce higher amounts of methyl radicals that can readily recombine with atomic hydrogen and reduce thus the rate of the H\u00a0+\u00a0O2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0O\u00a0+\u00a0OH branching reaction. The kinetic model predicts closely the experimental data for flame propagation and extinction for various fuel mixtures and pressures, and for various amounts of carbon dioxide in the fuel blend. On the other hand, it underpredicts, in general, the ignition temperatures.",

     "abstract": "Experimental measurements of burning rates, analysis of key reactions and kinetic pathways, and modeling studies were performed for H2/CH4/O2/diluent flames spanning a wide range of fuel-lean conditions: equivalence ratios from 0.30 to 1.0, flame temperatures from 1400 to 1800\u00a0K, pressures from 1 to 25\u00a0atm, CH4 fuel fractions from 0 to 0.1. The experimental data show negative pressure dependence of burning rate at high-pressure, low-flame-temperature conditions for all equivalence ratios and with CH4 addition. Substantial differences are observed between literature model predictions and the experimental data as well as among model predictions themselves \u2013 up to a factor of four at high pressures. Similar to our previous work that demonstrated that none of the recent kinetic models reproduced the measured pressure dependence of the mass burning rate for all diluent concentrations and medium to high equivalence ratios, here it is demonstrated that none reproduce the measured pressure dependence for very low equivalence ratios. The effect of pressure on the kinetics of lean flames is largely driven by competition of both H\u00a0+\u00a0O2(+M)\u00a0=\u00a0HO2(+M) and HO2\u00a0+\u00a0O/OH/HO2 with the main branching reactions, in contrast to rich mixtures that are largely driven by competition of both H\u00a0+\u00a0O2(+M)\u00a0=\u00a0HO2(+M) and HO2\u00a0+\u00a0H with the main branching reactions. Methane addition is shown to influence the pressure dependence mainly through reactions of CH3 with H and HO2. Given the nature of the modeling problem for high-pressure flames, it appears that a rigorous solution to improving predictive capabilities will require both empirical adjustments of multiple rate constant parameters as well as improved characterization of the functional temperature and pressure dependence of certain highly sensitive reactions. Furthermore, many of the reactions responsible for uncertainties in the pressure dependence of H2/O2 flames at high pressures are shown to contribute significantly to uncertainties in the pressure dependence of flames of hydrocarbon fuels.",

These experimental results also agree well with computed values using a detailed reaction mechanism. Furthermore, a mechanistic investigation aided by sensitivity analysis identified that kinetic effects through the global activation energy, followed by thermal effects through the adiabatic flame temperature, have the most influence on the increase in the flame speeds and the associated linear variation with RH due to hydrogen addition. Nonequidiffusion effects due to the high mobility of hydrogen, through the global Lewis number, have the least influence.

     "abstract": "Binary fuel blends provide challenges to chemical kinetics models not seen by testing only pure fuels, allowing them to be proven over a wider range of inputs. The effect of adding dimethyl ether (DME) to methane (CH4) on the laminar flame speed, Markstein length, and Lewis number was studied experimentally and numerically over a range of initial pressures from 1 to 10\u00a0atm, with the volumetric ratios of the fuel blends ranging from 60% CH4/40% DME to 80% CH4/20% DME. This data set includes high-pressure results that have never been published before. The experimental results were compared to an improved kinetics model, an ongoing effort spanning the past few years. Model results are in very good agreement with the experimental data. For the 80/20 blend of CH4/DME, the Lewis number remained close to unity as the equivalence ratio increased, in comparison to the large decrease in Lewis number for pure DME as equivalence ratio is increased. This small change in Lewis number, with the value remaining near unity, resulted in the 80/20 blend of CH4/DME remaining stable throughout the entire range of 5-atm experiments, while all other pure fuels and blends exhibited instabilities at initial pressures equal to or greater than 5\u00a0atm. In addition, the Markstein lengths were greatly affected by the blending of the fuels. A small amount of DME addition caused the Markstein lengths to change by a large value. Finally, a rigorous uncertainty analysis was performed on the experimental data, giving the error with respect to the true value rather than the standard deviation of repeated experiments.",

     "abstract": "The Heat Flux method was further developed to significantly reduce its experimental uncertainty and used to determine burning velocities under conditions when the net heat loss from the flame to the burner is zero. Non-stretched flames were stabilized on a perforated plate burner at 1\u00a0atm. Measurements of the adiabatic burning velocity of methane/air flames at initial mixture temperatures of 318\u00a0K are presented. Previously, tiny thermocouples in the thin burner plate were used to evaluate when the heat flux of the flame to the burner is zero. Related errors limit the accuracy of the method so far. A new experimental procedure based on thermographic phosphors is described which avoids these errors. The new experimental procedure is described. An UV thermographic phosphor ZnO:Zn was selected and used to sensitively control the temperature uniformity on the burner plate to within 60\u00a0mK. Uncertainties of the measurements were analyzed and assessed experimentally. A more accurate evaluation of the gas velocities, using mass weighting, was introduced to increase the accuracy further. The uncertainty of the measured adiabatic burning velocities due to the temperature scattering can be reduced from typically \u00b11.5\u00a0cm/s at \u03a6\u00a0=\u00a00.7 methane/air flame to \u00b10.25\u00a0cm/s.

     "abstract": "The effect of Soret diffusion on flame speed of the freely-propagating planar premixed flames was computationally studied for n-butane/air mixtures using a detailed reaction mechanism and transport. The results show that Soret effect almost has no influence on the n-butane/air flame speed, and the sensitivity analysis of flame speed shows that only very light species H radical is involved in the ranked key reactions. That is to say, the Soret diffusion of H radical has no influence on the flame speed. However, the Soret effect of H plays an important role on hydrogen/air flame speed. We found that the Soret diffusion flux of the kth species just exists in the overlap region which consists of the rear part of \u201cdriving force\u201d gradT/T profile and the front part of mole fraction profile of the kth species in the freely-propagating planar premixed flame. Compared with hydrogen/air flame, the investigation shows that for the n-butane/air flame, due to the inherent feature of total heat release rate, the high temperature largely reduces the \u201cdriving force\u201d gradT/T especially on the rear part of its profile and compared with the peak of temperature gradient the location of \u201cdriving force\u201d peak is closer to the unburned side, on the other hand the broader consumption layer of H weakens the front part of mole fraction of H and makes the peak of H mole fraction far away from the unburned side. Thus, the overlap region is narrow and low values of \u201cdriving force\u201d and mole fraction of H embed in it.",
