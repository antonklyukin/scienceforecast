     "abstract": "Ozone addition is a promising method to enhance and control combustion and ignition processes. It can be produced efficiently at atmospheric or elevated pressure conditions and its lifetime is sufficiently long to allow for remote production and transport to reaction zones. Over the past decades, the effect of ozone addition on ignition and combustion processes has been extensively studied from bench top fundamental burners to practical internal combustion engines. Ozone has shown the capability to accelerate ignition and control ignition timing, enhance flame propagation, improve flame stabilization, pre-process fuel to modify emission and reactivity characteristics, and reduce certain pollutant formation. Such enhancement is closely related to ozone chemistry, especially the decomposition of ozone to produce atomic oxygen and the rapid exothermic ozonolysis reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons. The former requires elevated temperature to release atomic oxygen and initiate fuel/atomic oxygen reactions typically in the preheat zone, while the latter initiates low temperature (even room temperature) direct fuel/ozone reactions. These findings provide new opportunities in the development of strategies to enhance and control combustion/ignition processes. This article provides a comprehensive review of the basic principles of ozone enhanced reactive processes, including fundamental ozone chemistry, ozone generation and quantification, and the progress in the study of ozone addition in combustion systems.",

     "abstract": "Mercury, as a global pollutant, has raised worldwide concern due to its high toxicity, long-distance transport, persistence, and bioaccumulation in the environment. Coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) are considered as the major anthropogenic mercury emission source to the atmosphere, especially for China, India, and the US. Studies on mercury in coal combustion process have been carried out for decades, which include content and occurrence forms of mercury in coal, mercury transformation during coal combustion, sampling, co-removal and emission of mercury in CFPPs, mercury removal technologies for CFPPs. This current review summarizes the knowledge and research developments concerning these mercury-related issues, and hopes to provide a comprehensive understanding of mercury in coal combustion process and guidance for future mercury research directions.The average mercury content in the coal from China, the US, and South Africa is 0.20, 0.17, and 0.20\u202fmg/kg, respectively, which is higher than the world's coal average value of 0.1\u202fmg/kg. In general, mercury in coal is in the forms of sulfide-bound mercury (mainly pyritic mercury, dominant), clay-bound mercury, and organic matter-bound mercury, which are influenced by diagenetic, coalification, and post-diagenetic conditions, etc. Mercury transformation in coal combustion includes homogeneous (without fly ash) and heterogeneous (with fly ash) reaction. The transformation is affected by the coal types, flue gas components, flue gas temperature, combustion atmosphere, coal ash properties, etc. The effects of chlorine, NOx, SO2, H2O, O2 NH3 on elemental mercury (Hg0) homogeneous oxidation and the influence of physical structure properties, unburned carbon, and metal oxides in fly ash as well as flue gas components on Hg0 heterogeneous transformation are systematically reviewed in detail. For the mercury transformation in oxy-coal combustion, O2 promotes Hg0 oxidation with Cl2 while NO and CO2 inhibit or do not favor that reaction. CO2 increases Hg0 oxidation in the atmosphere of NO and N2. SO2 will limit Hg0 oxidation, while HCl has a higher oxidation effect on Hg0 than that in air-coal combustion atmosphere. Fly ash plays an important role in Hg0 oxidation. SO3 inhibits mercury retention by fly ash while H2O promotes the oxidation.The sampling or analysis principle, sampling requirements, and advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used on-site mercury sampling methods, namely, Ontarion Hydro Method (OHM), US EPA Method 30B, and Hg-CEMS, are compared. The air pollution control devices (APCDs) in CFPPs also have the mercury co-removal ability besides the conventional pollutants, such as NOx, particulate matter (PM), SO2, and fine PM. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment, electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or fabric filter (FF), and wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) device are good at Hg0 oxidation, particulate mercury (Hgp) removal, and oxidized mercury (Hg2+) capture, respectively. The Hg0 oxidation rate for SCR equipment, and the total mercury (Hgt, Hgt\u202f=\u202fHg0\u202f+\u202fHg2+\u202f+\u202fHgp) removal rate for ESP, FF, and WFGD device is 6.5\u201379.9%, 11.5\u201390.4%, 28.5\u201390%, and 3.9\u201372%, respectively. Wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) can capture Hg0, Hg2+, and Hgp simultaneously. The mercury transformation process in SCR, ESP, FF, WFGD, and WESP is also discussed. Hgt removal in ESP+WFGD, SCR+ESP+WFGD, SCR+ESP+FF+WFGD, and SCR+ESP+WFGD+WESP is 35.5\u201384%, 43.8\u201394.9%, 58.78\u201373.32%, and 56.59\u201389.07%, respectively. The mercury emission concentration in the reviewed CFPPs of China, South Korea, Poland, the Netherlands, and the US is 0.29\u201316.3\u202f\u00b5g/m3. Mercury in some fly ash and gypsum, and in most WFGD and WESP wastewater, is higher than the relevant limits, which needs to be paid attention to during their processing.Mercury removal technologies for CFPPs can be divided into pre-combustion (including coal washing technology and mild pyrolysis method), in-combustion (including low-NOx combustion technology, circulating fluidized bed combustion technology, and halogens addition into coal), and post-combustion (including existing commercial SCR catalyst improvement, inhibiting Hg0 re-emission in WFGD, mercury oxidizing catalysts, injecting oxidizing chemicals, carbon-based adsorbents, fly ash, calcium-based adsorbents, and mineral adsorbents) based on the mercury removal position. The mercury removal effects, mercury removal mechanism, and/or influencing factors are summarized in detail. One of the regenerable mercury removal adsorbents, the magnetic adsorbent modified by metal oxides or the metal halides, is the most promising sorbent for mercury removal from CFPPs. It has advantages of high mercury removal efficiency, low investment, easy separation from fly ash, and mercury recovery, etc. Lastly, further works about mercury transformation in coal combustion atmosphere, mercury co-removal by APCDs, the emission in CFPPs, and mercury removal technologies for CFPPs are noted.",

     "abstract": "Atomization and evaporation processes have extensively existed in a variety of scientific and engineering applications, such as, rain formation, spray cooling, and spray combustion in propulsion devices. In spray combustion, atomization and evaporation processes govern the resultant liquid droplet characteristics, which strongly affect the combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions. However, atomization and evaporation are very complicated processes that involve convoluted interfaces as well as the breakup and coalescence of liquid masses, together with mass and heat transfers on the interface. Deep insights into atomization and evaporation put a significant challenge to the measuring techniques due to the harsh conditions and multi-scale nature of the problem within the apparatus. With the developments of computational algorithm and computer capacity, detailed numerical simulation of the atomization and evaporation processes has been a promising tool to explore the underlying physics. Level set method is such an interface capturing method, and tremendous progresses have been made for detailed numerical simulation of atomization and evaporation over the past few decades. In this article, we attempt to review the recent progresses in the development of the level set method and its applications to atomization and evaporation. Firstly, the fundamentals of the level set method are introduced and recent advances in improving the mass conservation are emphasized. Secondly, numerical issues for detailed numerical simulation of atomization and evaporation are summarized and the strategies for treating them are highlighted. We then review the state-of-the-art progresses in detailed numerical simulation of atomization and evaporation with the level set method. The challenges and future prospects are summarized in the end.",

     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "Lithium-ion cells currently power almost all electronic devices and power tools; they are a key enabling technology for electric vehicles and are increasingly considered to be the technology of choice for grid storage. In line with this increased applicability, there is also an increase in the development of new commercial lithium-ion cell technologies that incorporate innovative functional components (electrode material compositions and electrolyte formulations) and designs, leading to a diverse range of performance characteristics. The uniqueness of each technology in-turn gives rise to unique evolutions of cell performance as the cell degrades because of usage. Non-destructively measuring and subsequently tracking the evolution of lithium-ion cell characteristics is valuable for both industrial engineers and academic researchers. To proceed in this regard, stakeholders have often devised their own procedures for characterising lithium-ion cells, typically without considering unification, comparability or compatibility. This makes the comparison of technologies complicated. This comprehensive review for the first time has analysed and discusses the various international standards and regulations for the characterisation and electrical testing of lithium-ion cells, specifically for high-power automotive and grid applications.",

     "abstract": "Worldwide emphasis on fuel efficiency, low emissions, and use of low-quality fuels such as biogas continues to drive the development of combustors that operate over a wider range of fuel/air ratios and with higher burning velocities than their conventional counterparts. Enhancement of reaction rates is required to increase burning velocities and widen fuel/air operating ranges over values achievable in conventional combustors, and extensive research over the last few decades has shown that transferring heat in a reactor from hot combustion products to incoming reactants can accomplish this enhancement without external energy addition. These reactors, called heat recirculating reactors, use various geometries and flow strategies to optimize the heat transfer. In this paper, research on heat recirculating reactors is reviewed with an emphasis on the most important designs and applications. The basic characteristics of a heat recirculating reactor are encompassed in a simple configuration: a flame stabilized in a tube with high thermal conductivity. More complex designs that have evolved to further optimize heat transfer and recirculation are then described, including porous reactors with or without flame stabilization and channel reactors consisting of parallel tubes or slots. Advanced designs introduce additional means of heat transfer, such as transverse heat transfer from hot products through channel walls to incoming reactants, thereby leading to the counter-flow channel reactor. The flexibility of heat recirculating reactors to operate on a variety of fuels and over wide operating ranges has led to many applications including fuel reformers, radiant heaters and thermal oxidizers, and important work on these applications is reviewed. Finally, future research directions are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Lignin is currently an under-used material of the pulping and cellulosic ethanol production plants. The first and foremost objective in dealing with lignin is to augment the use of this aromatic compound and financial profitability of lignin-based processes. Of particular interests are lignin oxidation and depolymerization methods that harvest either the aromatic subunits of polymers or monomeric/oligomeric aromatic products used as platform chemicals. In this context, many studies have focused on the catalytic processes in which a nitroxyl catalyst, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), was employed to oxidize hydroxyl groups in lignin structure and selectively depolymerize lignin via cleavage of the ether and CC bonds. In discussing the advanced studies especially over the last decade on the oxidation of lignin models with TEMPO catalyst systems, this review provides a description of promising methods that can be employed for authentic lignin conversion. In the present review, a particular emphasis is dedicated to the proposed mechanisms for the oxidation of lignin and lignin models.",

     "publication date": "03-2019",
     "abstract": "Biomass fast pyrolysis is potentially one of the cheapest routes toward renewable liquid fuels. Its commercialization, however, poses a multi-scale challenge, which starts with the characterization of feedstock, products and reaction intermediates at molecular scales, and continues with understanding the complex reaction network taking place in different reactor configurations, and in the case of catalytic pyrolysis and upgrading on different catalysts. In addition, crude pyrolysis oil is not immediately usable in the current energy infrastructure, due to undesirable properties such as low energy content and corrosiveness as a result of its high oxygenate content. It, therefore, needs to be upgraded and fractionated to desired specifications. While various types of pyrolysis reactors and upgrading technologies are under development, knowledge transfer and closing the gap between theory and application requires model development. In-depth understanding of the reaction mechanisms and kinetics should be combined with the knowledge of multi-scale transport phenomena to enable design, optimization, and control of complex pyrolysis reactors. Finally, underpinning economic and environmental impacts of biofuel production requires expanding the system boundaries to include the overall process and supply chain. The present contribution aims at providing a comprehensive multi-scale review that discusses the state of the art of each of these aspects, as well as their multi-scale interactions. The study is mainly focused on fast pyrolysis, although reference to other types of pyrolysis technologies is made for the sake of comparison and knowledge transfer.",

The conventional parabolic trough collectors are used in various applications of medium and high-temperature levels. However, there are numerous studies which investigate alternative designs. The reasons for examining different PTC configurations regard the thermal efficiency increase, the reduction of the manufacturing cost and the development of more compact designs. The objective of this review paper is to summarize the existing alternative designs of PTC and to suggest the future trends in this area. Optical and thermal modifications are examined, as well as the use of concentrating thermal photovoltaic collectors. The optical modifications include designs with secondary concentrators, stationary concentrators and strategies for achieving uniform heat flux. The thermal modifications regard the use of nanofluids, turbulators and the use of thermally modified receivers with insulation, double-coating and radiation shields. The concentrating thermal photovoltaics are systems with flat or triangular receivers which can operate in low or in medium temperature levels with the proper alternative designs. It has been found that there are many promising choices for designing PTC with higher thermal performance and lower cost. The conclusions of this work can be used as guidelines for future trends in linear parabolic concentrating technologies.",

     "abstract": "Transportation of people and goods largely relies on the use of fossil hydrocarbons, contributing to global warming and problems with local air quality. There are a number of alternatives to fossil fuels that can avoid a net carbon emission and can also decrease pollutant emissions. However, many have significant difficulty in competing with fossil fuels due to either limited availability, limited energy density, high cost, or a combination of these.Methanol (CH3OH) is one of these alternatives, which was demonstrated in large fleet trials during the 1980s and 1990s, and is currently again being introduced in various places and applications. It can be produced from fossil fuels, but also from biomass and from renewable energy sources in carbon capture and utilization schemes. It can be used in pure form or as a blend component, in internal combustion engines (ICEs) or in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). These features added to the fact it is a liquid fuel, making it an efficient way of storing and distributing energy, make it stand out as one of the most attractive scalable alternatives.This review focuses on the use of methanol as a pure fuel or blend component for ICEs. First, we introduce methanol historically, briefly introduce the various methods for its production, and summarize health and safety of using methanol as a fuel. Then, we focus on its use as a fuel for ICEs. The current data on the physical and chemical properties relevant for ICEs are reviewed, highlighting the differences with fuels such as ethanol and gasoline. These are then related to the research reported on the behaviour of methanol and methanol blends in spark ignition and compression ignition engines. Many of the properties of methanol that are significantly different from those of for example gasoline (such as its high heat of vaporization) lead to advantages as well as challenges. Both are extensively discussed.Methanol\u2019s performance, in terms of power output, peak and part load efficiency, and emissions formation is summarized, for so-called flex-fuel engines as well as for dedicated engines. We also briefly touch upon engine hardware changes and material compatibility. Methanol fuel reforming using engine waste heat is discussed, as a potential route towards further increases in efficiency and decreases in emissions. Next to the experimental work, research efforts into modelling the behaviour of methanol as a fuel are also reviewed, including mixture formation, normal and abnormal combustion. Methanol\u2019s properties such as high latent heat, fast burning velocity, high knock-resistance and no carbon-to-carbon bonds are shown to leverage engine technology developments such as increased compression ratios, downsizing and dilution; enabling much increased engine efficiencies.Finally, we point out the current gaps in knowledge to indicate which areas future research should be directed at.",

     "publication date": "01-2019",
     "abstract": "This paper reviews current understanding of the manner in which non-premixed jet flames respond to flow disturbances, and compares these characteristics to premixed flames. Disturbances in flow velocity excite wrinkles on non-premixed flame sheets and perturbations in heat release. These disturbances convect axially along the flame at the local flow velocity and decay in amplitude. Sufficiently large disturbance amplitudes cause opposing sides of the flame to merge and pinch off, leading to multiply connected flame sheets. The space-time characteristics of flame wrinkles on premixed and non-premixed flame sheets are quite similar, as they are dominated by flow disturbances moving the flame around, convection of the wrinkles downstream, and dissipation of wrinkles. In contrast, the heat release dynamics are quite different, as heat release oscillations in premixed flames are nearly uniformly distributed along the flame, whereas in non-premixed flames they are concentrated near the burner outlet where mixture fraction gradients are highest. In addition, flame area fluctuations are the dominant mechanism leading to heat release oscillations in constant burning velocity premixed flames, while mass burning rate oscillations dominate non-premixed flames. The flame transfer function, i.e., the normalized ratio of heat release and flow oscillations, is of O(1) at low frequencies and transitions to a 1/St behavior at high frequencies, for both premixed and non-premixed flames, where St denotes the flame Strouhal number, physically representing the ratio of the convective and the forcing time-scale. While the mechanisms dominating heat release oscillations are quite different for premixed and non-premixed flames, these comparable asymptotic tendencies are actually the result of the same effects; namely, that the heat release is proportional to the instantaneous mass flux of reactants in the quasi-steady, low Strouhal number case, and phase cancellation associated with convecting regions of oscillatory heat release leads to the 1/St behavior in the St\u202f\u226b\u202f1 regime. Non-premixed flames have an additional 1 / S t transfer function character at an intermediate range of Strouhal numbers, due to the sharply varying axial dependence of mean heat release near the burner exit.",

Usual bias and spreading statistical indicators are useful tools but taking proper decision by managers of funding agencies and policy makers requires usage of additional error measures. Several classes of forecasting models have been compared: persistence, classical statistics, machine learning, cloud-motion tracking, numerical weather prediction and hybrid models (combining classical statistics with machine learning approach and/or exogenous inputs). Forecasting errors increase by increasing the time-horizon. Forecasting model performance depends on time-horizon and climate. Machine learning and hybrid models have the best performance for intra-hour performance in all climates. The best intra-hour forecasts are provided in all climates by machine learning and classical statistics models while the hybrid models perform well in tropical and snow climates. For day-ahead forecasts the hybrid models have very good performance in all climates. Generally, the hybrid models have the best performance.

In spite of its reliability and proven success, CAS process suffers from intensive energy requirement and lack of capability to capture a high amount of organic matter from wastewater. In order to recover the energy present in wastewater efficiently, it is crucial to up-concentrate the organics in wastewaters. Several physicochemical and biological processes may be employed for up-concentration of organics and capturing them onto sludge. Capturing of organic matter in sludge phase allows improved energy recovery through anaerobic digestion. This study aims to present a comprehensive evaluation of the current practices applied to up-concentrate organic matter in municipal wastewater. The paper discusses the most frequently used up-concentration methods by addressing lab-scale and full-scale applications with typical operational parameters as well as providing their strengths and constraints. In addition, various up-to-date treatment configurations are introduced in order to provide a future perspective in this field.",

     "abstract": "Heterogeneous and combined hetero-/homogeneous chemical processes have attracted increased attention in many energy conversion systems, which include large-scale power generation, microreactors for portable power generation, household burners, fuel-processing technologies and automotive exhaust gas after treatment. Progress in such systems crucially depends on the development of catalysts with enhanced activity and thermal stability and on the comprehensive understanding of the fundamental processes occurring near gas\u2013solid reacting interfaces. Recent advances in non-intrusive lased-based measurements of gas-phase thermoscalars over the catalyst boundary layer are reviewed. Such measurements, combined with theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, have fostered fundamental investigations of the catalytic and gas-phase chemical processes and their coupling at industrially-relevant operating conditions. The methodology for assessing local catalytic reaction rates and validating gas-phase reaction mechanisms under steady conditions using 1-D Raman and planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of radical species, respectively, is presented first. Progress in the measurement of minor and major stable species using PLIF is outlined and the potential of this technique as a suitable method for assessing the catalytic reactivity under dynamic operating conditions is discussed. State of the art numerical modeling necessary for the interpretation of the measurements is presented in parallel with the laser-based techniques. Turbulence modeling, direct numerical simulation (DNS) and near-wall non-intrusive measurements of species concentrations and velocity have clarified aspects of the complex interplay between interphase turbulent transport and hetero-/homogeneous kinetics. Controlling parameters are the competition between the heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction pathways, diffusional imbalance of the deficient reactant, flow laminarization induced by the hot catalytic walls, and fuel leakage through the gaseous reaction zone that leads to concurrent catalytic and gas-phase combustion. Experimental needs for assessing turbulent fluctuations of catalytic reaction rates as well as for investigating intrinsic instabilities (heterogeneously or homogeneously driven) are discussed. Future directions for combining in situ surface science diagnostics with in situ non-intrusive gas-phase thermoscalar diagnostics and for advancing current numerical tools are finally proposed.",

     "abstract": "Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are bromine-bearing hydrocarbons added or applied to materials to increase their fire resistance. As thermal treatment and recycling are common disposal methods for BFR-laden objects, it is essential to precisely describe their decomposition chemistry at elevated temperatures pertinent to their thermal recycling. Laboratory-level and pilot-scale investigations have addressed the thermal decomposition of pure BFRs and/or BFR-laden polymers under oxidative and pyrolytic environments, typically at temperatures of 280\u2013900\u00b0C. These studies shed light on the effects of various factors influencing the decomposition behaviour of BFRs such as chemical character, polymer matrix, residence time, bromine input, oxygen concentration, and temperature. Although BFRs decomposition mainly occurs in a condensed phase, gas phase reactions also contribute significantly to the overall decomposition of BFRs. Exposing BFRs to temperatures higher than their melting points results in evaporation. Quantum chemical calculations have served to provide mechanistic and kinetic insights into the chemical phenomena operating in decomposition of BFRs and subsequent emissions of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). Under thermal conditions such as smouldering, municipal waste incineration, pyrolysis, thermal recycling, uncontrolled burning and fires, BFRs degrade and form brominated products of incomplete combustion (BPICs). Thermal degradation of BFRs often proceeds in the presence of bromine atoms which inhibit complete combustion. Major BPICs comprise brominated benzenes and phenols in addition to a wide range of brominated aromatics. Pyrolytic versus oxidative conditions seems to have very little influence on the thermal stability and decomposition behaviour of commonly-deployed BFRs. Thermal degradation of BFRs produces potent precursors to PBDD/Fs. Experimental studies have established inventories of PBDD/F emissions with alarming high yields for many BFRs. Co-combustion of BFRs-containing objects with a chlorine source (e.g. polyvinyl chlorides) results in the emission of significant concentrations of mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (i.e. PXDD/Fs). Formation of PBDD/Fs from incomplete BFRs decomposition occurs primarily due to the condensations of gas phase precursors, including unaltered structural entities of some BFRs in their own right. Complete destruction of BFRs promotes PBDD/Fs formation via de novo synthesis. Bromination of PBDD/Fs in gas phase reactions is more prevalent if compared with chlorination mechanisms of PCDD/Fs, which is largely dominated by heterogeneous pathways. In uncontrolled burning and in simulated fly ash experiments, a strong correlation between congeners patterns of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and PBDD/Fs indicate that PBDEs function as direct precursors for PBDD/Fs, even in the de novo synthesis route. In this review, we critically discuss current literature on BFRs thermal decomposition mechanisms; gather information regarding the contribution of homogenous and heterogeneous routes to overall BFRs decomposition; survey all studies pertinent to the emission of PBDD/Fs and their analogous mixed halogenated counterparts from open burning of e-waste, and finally, highlight knowledge gaps and potential directions that warrant further investigations.",

Hence, it is proposed that ammonia, with its established transportation network and high flexibility, could provide a practical next generation system for energy transportation, storage and use for power generation. Therefore, this review highlights previous influential studies and ongoing research to use this chemical as a viable energy vector for power applications, emphasizing the challenges that each of the reviewed technologies faces before implementation and commercial deployment is achieved at a larger scale.

     "abstract": "Since its discovery, the Flameless Combustion (FC) regime has been seen as a promising alternative combustion technique to reduce pollutant emissions of gas turbine engines. This combustion mode is often characterized by well-distributed reaction zones, which can potentially decrease temperature gradients, acoustic oscillations and, consequently NOx emission. However, the application of FC to gas turbines is still not a reality due to the inherent difficulties faced in attaining the regime while meeting all the engine requirements. Over the past years, investigations related to FC have been focused on understanding the fundamentals of this combustion regime, the regime boundaries, its computational modelling, and combustor design attempts. This article reviews the progress achieved so far, discusses the various definitions of the FC regime, and attempts to point the directions for future research. The review suggests that modelling of the FC regime is still not capable of predicting intermediate species and pollutant emissions. Comprehensive experimental databases with conditions relevant to gas turbine combustors are not available, and moreover, many of the current experiments do not necessarily represent the FC regime. By analysing the latest developments in computational modelling, the review points to the most promising approaches for the prediction of reaction zones and pollutant emissions in FC. The lessons learned from previous design attempts provide valuable insights into the design of a successful gas turbine engine operating under the FC regime. The review concludes with some examples where the gas turbine architecture has been exploited to advance the possibilities of FC in gas turbines.",

     "abstract": "Growing public awareness of the environmental impact of coal combustion has raised serious concerns about the various hazardous trace elements produced by coal firing. Arsenic deserves special attention due to its toxicity, volatility, bioaccumulation in the environment, and potential carcinogenic properties. As the main anthropogenic source of arsenic is coal combustion, its behavior in power plants is of concern. Unlike mercury, arsenic behavior in coal combustion has not been subjected to systematic, in-depth research. Different researchers have reached opposing conclusions about the behavior of arsenic in combustion systems and, as yet, there is relatively little research on arsenic removal technologies.In this paper, the volatilization, transformation, and emission behavior of arsenic and its removal technologies are discussed in depth. Factors affecting the volatilization characteristics of arsenic are summarized, including temperature, pressure, mode of occurrence of arsenic, coal rank, mineral matter, and the sulfur and chlorine content of the fuel. The behavior of arsenic during oxy-fuel combustion and the effect of combustion atmosphere (O2, CO2, SO2 and H2O(g)) are also reviewed in detail.In order to better understand the pathways of arsenic in a power plant environment, a particular focus in this work is the transformation mechanism of ultra-fine ash particles and the partitioning behavior of arsenic. Finally, the effects of air pollution control devices (APCDs) on arsenic emissions are examined, along with the effectiveness of flue gas arsenic removal technologies with different kinds of adsorbents, including calcium-based adsorbents, metal oxides, activated carbon, and fly ash.",

     "abstract": "Biofuels are called upon to play an important role, not only in reducing the associated greenhouse-gases emissions, but also in enabling the gradual independence from fossil sources, rendering low-carbon-highly-sustainable fuels. Today, the involvement of biomass-derived sources into existing petroleum refineries has a growing interest due to the increasing unpredictability of oil prices, environmental concerns and the necessity to secure an energy supply. Petroleum refineries already have a well-developed infrastructure to produce fuels and base chemicals and, consequently, would not require additional intensive investments for processing of alternative feedstocks. From this point of view, co-processing of biomass-derived feedstocks with petroleum fractions is an attractive option, which has already been industrially demonstrated in some cases. There are two main technologies that could be used for co-processing of biomass feedstocks with petroleum fractions, the first one being catalytic hydroprocessing and the second one being fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Both technologies are found in virtually any conventional refinery. It is obvious that the co-processing of biomass-based feedstocks with petroleum fractions has the potential to play an important role in the near future. There are several research studies in literature that examine both technologies for co-processing. However, while there are many technological reviews that focus on stand-alone biofuel production (e.g., FAME biodiesel, bioethanol, HVO etc.), a dedicated technological review on co-processing for production of hybrid fuels is still missing. Therefore, this paper is focused on presenting a state-of-the-art review on co-processing bio-based feedstocks with petroleum fractions via hydroprocessing and fluid catalytic cracking, looking at different potential feedstocks, catalysts, operating conditions, products and benefits in detail. As there is no specifically dedicated literature review in this field, the content of this review provides a guideline on co-processing of different bio-based feedstocks with petroleum fractions, aimed at delivering a technological assessment of the existing research efforts.",

     "abstract": "Metal fuels, as recyclable carriers of clean energy, are promising alternatives to fossil fuels in a future low-carbon economy. Fossil fuels are a convenient and widely-available source of stored solar energy that have enabled our modern society; however, fossil-fuel production cannot perpetually keep up with increasing energy demand, while carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel combustion cause climate change. Low-carbon energy carriers, with high energy density, are needed to replace the multiple indispensable roles of fossil fuels, including for electrical and thermal power generation, for powering transportation fleets, and for global energy trade. Metals have high energy densities and metals are, therefore, fuels within many batteries, energetic materials, and propellants. Metal fuels can be burned with air or reacted with water to release their chemical energy at a range of power-generation scales. The metal-oxide combustion products are solids that can be captured and then be recycled using zero-carbon electrolysis processes powered by clean energy, enabling metals to be used as recyclable zero-carbon solar fuels or electrofuels. A key technological barrier to the increased use of metal fuels is the current lack of clean and efficient combustor/reactor/engine technologies to convert the chemical energy in metal fuels into motive or electrical power (energy). This paper overviews the concept of low-carbon metal fuels and summarizes the current state of our knowledge regarding the reaction of metal fuels with water, to produce hot hydrogen on demand, and the combustion of metal fuels with air in laminar and turbulent flames. Many important questions regarding metal-fuel combustion processes remain unanswered, as do questions concerning the energy-cycle efficiency and life-cycle environmental impacts and economics of metals as recyclable fuels. Metal fuels can be an important technology option within a future low-carbon society and deserve focused attention to address these open questions.",

     "abstract": "Accurate measurement and prediction of laminar burning velocity is important for characterization of premixed combustion properties of a fuel, development and validation of new kinetic models, and calibration of turbulent combustion models. Understanding the variation of laminar burning velocity with thermodynamic conditions is important from the perspective of practical applications in industrial furnaces, gas turbine combustors and rocket engines as operating temperatures and pressures are significantly higher than ambient conditions. With this perspective, a brief review of spherical flame propagation method, counterflow/stagnation burner method, heat-flux method, annular stepwise method, externally heated diverging channel method, and Bunsen method is presented. A direct comparison of power exponents for temperature (\u03b1) and pressure (\u03b2) obtained from different experiments and derived from various kinetic mechanisms is reported to provide an independent tool for detailed validation of kinetic schemes. Accurate prediction of laminar burning velocities at higher temperatures and pressures for individual fuels will help in closer scrutiny of the existing experimental data for various uncertainties due to inherent challenges in individual measurement techniques. Laminar burning velocity data for hydrogen (H2), gaseous alkane fuels (methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, n-pentane), liquid alkane fuels (n-heptane, isooctane, n-decane), alcohols (CH3OH, C2H5OH, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol) and di-methyl ether (DME) are obtained from literature of last three decades for a wide range of pressures (1\u201310\u202fbar), temperatures (300\u2013700\u202fK), equivalence ratios and mixture dilutions. The available experimental and numerical data for H2 and methane fuels compares well for various pressures and temperatures. However, more experimental and kinetic model development studies are required for other fuels. Comparison of laminar burning velocity data obtained from different measurement techniques at higher initial pressures and temperatures showed significant deviations for all fuels. This suggests to conduct focused measurements at elevated pressure and temperature conditions for different fuels to enable the development of accurate kinetic models for wider range of mixtures and thermodynamic conditions.",

     "abstract": "This review presents and discusses the progress in combining fast pyrolysis and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) to produce liquid fuel from solid, lignocellulosic biomass. Fast pyrolysis of biomass is a well-developed technology for bio-oil production at mass yields up to \u223c75%, but a high oxygen content of 35\u201350\u00a0wt% strongly limits its potential as transportation fuel. Catalytic HDO can be used to upgrade fast pyrolysis bio-oil, as oxygenates react with hydrogen to produce a stable hydrocarbon fuel and water, which is removed by separation. Research on HDO has been carried out for more than 30 years with increasing intensity over the past decades. Several catalytic systems have been tested, and we conclude that single stage HDO of condensed bio-oil is unsuited for commercial scale bio-oil upgrading, as the coking and polymerization, which occurs upon re-heating of the bio-oil, rapidly deactivates the catalyst and plugs the reactor. Dual or multiple stage HDO has shown more promising results, as the most reactive oxygenates can be stabilized at low temperature prior to deep HDO for full deoxygenation. Catalytic fast hydropyrolysis, which combines fast pyrolysis with catalytic HDO in a single reactor, eliminates the need for reheating condensed bio-oil, lowers side reactions, and produces a stable oil with oxygen content, H/C ratio, and heating value comparable to fossil fuels. We address several challenges, which must be overcome for continuous catalytic fast hydropyrolysis to become commercially viable, with the most urgent issues being: (i) optimization of operating conditions (temperature, H2 pressure, and residence time) and catalyst formulation to maximize oil yield and minimize cracking, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation, (ii) development of an improved process design and reactor configuration to allow for continuous operation including pressurized biomass feeding, fast entrainment and collection of char, which is catalytically active for side reactions, efficient condensation of the produced oil, and utilization and/or integration of by-products (non-condensable gasses and char), and (iii) long-term tests with respect to catalyst stability and possible pathways for regeneration. By reviewing past and current research from fast pyrolysis and catalytic HDO, we target a discussion of the combined processes, including direct catalytic fast hydropyrolysis. By critically evaluating their potential and challenges, we finally conclude, which future steps are necessary for these processes to become industrially feasible.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to review the present knowledge on ash formation, ash particle transport and deposition during solid fuel combustion, with emphasis on particle sticking and rebound behavior. A substantial part of the fuel can be inorganic, forming inorganic vapors and ash particles. The impaction of solid, molten or partially molten particles on surfaces is dependent on the particle and surface characteristics. For instance, a particulate deposit might capture incoming particles or be removed due to erosion, while a molten layer will collect all impacting particles, no matter if they are sticky or not. The main properties affecting the particle stickiness are the viscosity and surface tension for silicate-rich ashes. On the contrary, the stickiness of salt-rich ashes \u2013 typical for herbaceous biomass and wood- or waste-based fuels \u2013 is often described using the liquid melt fraction. Furthermore, the particle kinetic energy and the angle of impaction, are crucial parameters. If all kinetic energy is dissipated during the impact, the particle will remain on the surface. This review presents an overview of major ash forming elements found in biomass and coal, and discusses the heterogeneity of particles\u2019 inorganic composition. Ash transport and deposition mechanisms as well as their mathematical description are given and discussed, together with composition- and temperature-depended models for the estimation of ash particle and deposit properties. These properties are essential in order to describe the particle sticking and rebound behavior.Ash particle sticking and rebound criteria can be divided into three main groups, based on either: (1) the particle melt fraction, (2) the particle viscosity, or (3) the energy dissipation of a particle, upon impaction. Sticking criteria are presented, their required parameters are discussed and typical particle and surface properties found in combustion systems, are summarized. Eight different sticking criteria are implemented in a computational fluid dynamics code and computations are compared against measurements from an entrained flow reactor. Uniform sized soda-lime glass particles are applied instead of inhomogeneous fly ash particles, since soda-lime glass is known to behave similar to coal fly ash. Best agreement for the deposition rates on a clean tube is achieved using a criterion based on the work of Srinivasachar et\u00a0al. [1]. In this model, the sticking and rebound threshold, is a function of the particle kinetic energy, the angle of impaction, and, the particle viscosity. Particularly, the particle viscosity is confirmed as a key parameter for silicate-rich ashes. It should be calculated using temperature- and composition-dependent correlations, being aware that there is a significant scattering in the results from such models and that the models are often only valid in narrow compositional ranges, and cannot be used outside these. A mechanistic model is used to explain results from glass particle experiments and their dependence on the particle kinetic energy. Therefore, the impaction process is subdivided in four steps, and the energy dissipation of each step is calculated. These theoretical considerations show that the contact angle of a molten droplet with the substrate is of minor importance, and that the majority of depositing particles are dominated by the work of deformation against viscosity, rather than surface tension effects.This review underlines the importance of the particle viscosity, and its accurate prediction for silicate-rich ashes. The proposed criterion is able to predict the sticking of small, solid particles below 10\u2009\u00b5m diameter, as it is often observed in literature. Also, it is crucial to consider the surface structure and stickiness, in order to predict deposition rates in solid fuel-fired systems. Biomass ashes and their stickiness are more difficult, due to a different ash particle chemistry, compared to coal ashes. Salt-rich particles and their stickiness are controlled by the amount of liquid phase. Here, a link between the viscosity and amount of liquid phase is a promising approach, and should be addressed in future work. Furthermore, the viscosity of different ash particles \u2013 silicate-, salt- or Ca-rich \u2013 should preferentially be modeled from the chemical and physical structure instead of an empirical fitting procedure between fuel chemistry and viscosity measurements.",

     "abstract": "The production of fuels and chemicals from renewable lignocellulosic biomass resources has been a major research focus in the last few decades. The most efficient method for synthesizing value-added chemical products from sustainable feedstocks is direct catalytic conversion, however, the multifunctional and highly oxygenated biomass-derived substrates are significantly different from petroleum-based feedstocks. Thus, systematic development of new catalytic materials is required to take advantage of the only substantial source of renewable carbon. In this review, we discuss the foundational methodologies that enable rational catalyst design through the investigation of surface-adsorbate interactions and the elucidation of descriptors for selectivity control. Molecular spectroscopies, efficient and predictive computational modeling, rigorous kinetic investigations, and highly controlled materials synthesis have generated fundamental insights leading to general catalyst design principles in biomass upgrading processes. The application of each technique in biomass research is discussed in the context of several case studies, with a focus on the unique insights available from each technique. Moreover, the interplay among multiple techniques, particularly between experimental and computational methods, is also highlighted. Despite the impressive progress made in the biomass field, major roadblocks still exist due to the complexity in the composition and structure of both substrates and catalysts. We share our perspectives regarding future needs in selective catalytic conversions of multifunctional substrates and methods for accelerating catalyst development.",

In this review our current understanding of the mechanisms that are responsible for combustion-generated nitrogen-containing air pollutants is discussed. The thermochemistry of the relevant nitrogen compounds is updated, using the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) approach. Rate parameters for the key gas-phase reactions of the nitrogen species are surveyed, based on available information from experiments and high-level theory. The mechanisms for thermal and prompt-NO, for fuel-NO, and NO formation via NNH or N2O are discussed, along with the chemistry of NO removal processes such as reburning and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction of NO.

As storage medium Solar Salt, a binary NaNO 3 \u2212 KNO 3 (60\u201340\u202fwt%) mixture, is most commonly used but variations of this system have promising thermal properties in terms of a lower melting temperature to minimize the risk of undesired salt freezing events.

It includes a historical perspective of research in this field, a discussion on the considerations to be made prior to choosing a primary fuel for reforming purposes, and the main processes in fuel reforming. Steam reforming offers a moderate degree of thermochemical recuperation and is applicable to methanol and ethanol feeding. Reforming with air reduces the degree of recuperation, but opens up the use of heavier fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel. Dry reforming (with CO2) offers the best recuperation but is prone to fast coking. The choice of catalyst and the expected side reactions for each fuel are also discussed. While there is extensive literature on steam reforming catalysts and kinetics at atmospheric pressure, studies at higher pressures and/or on decomposition reactions are very few. The thermodynamics of fuel reforming in ICE and simulation approaches are also discussed. The paper also reports on engineering aspects of fuel reformer design and provides an overview of engines with thermo-chemical recuperation (TCR), fuel supply, and load control strategies in ICE with TCR. In-cylinder fuel reforming as well as application of fuel reforming for performance improvement of emission aftertreatment systems are subsequently discussed. This overview reveals ongoing diverse research activities in the field of onboard fuel reforming. However, several problems, including reformate burning velocity at typical for ICE conditions, in-cylinder behavior of directly injected reformates and particle formation still need to be addressed.

     "abstract": "Electrostatic precipitator is the most efficient device used for the removal of fly ash particles from the flue gases produced by coal-fired boilers in power plants. However, the fractional collection efficiency of electrostatic precipitators steeply decreases for particles smaller than 1\u00a0\u03bcm, and particles in the size range of 200\u2013500\u202fnm are removed with lower collection efficiency than those outside this range. These particles are dangerous to humans and have detrimental environmental effects, so there is a need for novel more efficient technologies for their control. One of the answers to this challenge is the two-stage electrostatic precipitator, in which the electrostatic charging and precipitation processes have been separated. The PM2.5 particles (of a size\u202f<\u202f2.5\u00a0\u03bcm) are electrically charged in a separate device (precharger) to a maximal possible electric charge, and then precipitated in a parallel plate collector, free of corona discharge. The electric field in the collection stage can be higher than in an electrostatic precipitator due to the lack of sharp discharge points. A higher electric field allows an increase of the collection efficiency for PM2.5 particles. Another solution is the agglomeration of submicron particles to form larger particles before their precipitation by a parallel-plate collector, conventional electrostatic precipitator or any other gas cleaning device. In some of the reviewed devices, both of these processes were combined in a single device that allowed further increases in the collection efficiency for submicron particles. Devices of this type have been tested in a lab- or semi-industrial scale for the removal of PM2.5 particles from flue gases or diesel engine exhausts. In this paper, various constructions of two-stage electrostatic precipitators, comprising a precharger and/or agglomerator in the first stage, and an electrostatic collector in the second stage, have been reviewed. Some of these devices were able to increase the mass collection efficiency above 95% for PM2.5 particles.",

     "abstract": "Reviewing the literature from the last decade regarding the bioconversion of corn stover into ethanol, 474 references were identified containing 561 datasets. We found 144 datasets which were sufficiently consistent and detailed to address the current state of the art of corn stover conversion to bioethanol, and we were able to categorise 93% of these datasets into eight different technological configurations for the production of bioethanol, based on the pretreatment approaches used. After pretreating, the corn stover is subject to hydrolysis and fermentation, but these two process steps were largely identical in all datasets, albeit a range of operating conditions was reported. The final distillation of the ethanol was very rarely included in the datasets. By parameterising the bioethanol production by 26 parameters, including corn stover compositions, solid loadings, operational conditions, conversion efficiencies and material consumption, we were able to quantify the material flows for each technological configuration and estimate the uncertainty of the flows. The eight technological configurations produced 11\u201322% ethanol from the dry solid content of the corn stover. Technologies using alkaline-, solvent or ammonia-based pretreatments produced the largest amount of ethanol (19\u201322%), while fungi-based pretreatment produced much less (11%). All technological configurations resulted in large flows of solid as well as liquid residues, typically containing 60 to 70% of the dry solid corn stover content. Based on the selected datasets, statistical description is provided for all parameters, including mode, median, average and deviation, within each technological configuration. Bivariate correlation analysis across and within all technological configurations indicates that some operational parameters usually considered crucial in laboratory studies, e.g. pretreatment severity, show from a statistical perspective very little correlation with the yields. The review reveals that a great deal of research has addressed the challenge of converting corn stover into bioethanol, but a significant part of these studies is of limited value in terms of scope and documentation when addressing overall material flows and key parameters in a technological context.",

     "abstract": "Polymeric membranes can be used for the energy-efficient and low-cost gas separation. However, their inability to resist high temperatures limits their use in certain industries. Some polymer membranes can be operated at some levels of the unpleasant environments, but the energy- and cost-efficiencies are offset by the necessity to severely cool hot streams. In many cases, such implementation is impossible or altogether impractical. Therefore, numerous studies have been focused on modifying polymers to create synthetic polymeric membranes which survive at high temperatures. Polymer scientists introduced many thermally stable polymers mostly based on carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic polymers, which exhibit enhanced thermal stability. However, the major problem with these polymers is their low processability, which is mainly due to their insolubility or high phase transition temperatures. So far, there has been little success in processing the high-temperature-resistant polymers to make membranes with acceptable separation and performance characteristics. The aim of this study is to review efforts which have been made to produce high-performance polymeric membranes with a focus on the preparation procedure; whereby, the main limitations and challenges to be faced were explored. The key factors discussed include the type of polymer, membrane preparation method, thermal analysis results and application of the prepared membranes. The primary purpose of this review is to lay out the basics for selecting polymer, solvent, additives and the appropriate preparation method to produce thermally stable polymeric membranes for gas separation. The future direction of research and development to fully exploit the potential usage of thermally stable polymeric membranes to achieve commercially viable processes was also shown.",

     "abstract": "Trapped vortex combustor (TVC) is different from conventional swirl-stabilized combustors. It takes advantages of a cavity to stabilize the flame. When the cavity size of a TVC is well designed, a large rotating vortex can be formed in the cavity. The vortex cannot shed out the cavity and is thus named a \u201clocked\u201d or \u201cstable\u201d vortex. One of the main challenges for TVC design is fuel injection. Typically, fuel can be injected directly into the cavity or from the diffuser upstream. Injecting from the diffuser leads to the fuel being mixed with the air before it enters the combustor. When the fuel is injected directly into the cavity, it is desirable to supply the fuel in such way that the locked vortex in the cavity is reinforced. Furthermore, the fuel-air mixing in the cavity will be promoted, as the bypass air is directly added into the cavity. Since the recirculation zone anchored in the cavity is not exposed to the main incoming flow, stable combustion is achieved, even in the presence of a high speed main flow as typically expected in Ramjets and Scramjets. A well-designed trapped vortex combustor (TVC) enables a better fuel-air mixing, a better stabilized flame, lower emission, ultra-compact and high efficient combustion to be achievable. As a promising combustion concept, intensive scientific research has been conducted on TVC in the application areas of aerospace propulsion, power generation and waste incineration. In this work, we will firstly introduce the fundamental concepts, the development and evolution history of TVCs. The combustion, aerodynamics, and aeroacoustics features of trapped vortex combustion are then described. This includes reviewing and discussing the cavity flow/aerodynamics, fuel-air injection and mixing, trapped vortex combustion, emission and combustion of alternative fuels, and aeroacoustics characteristics.

A review of fugitive methane combustion mitigation and utilisation technologies, which are primarily aimed at methane emissions from coal mining activities, with a focus on modelling and simulation of ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion is presented. The challenges associated with ultra-lean methane oxidation are on the ignition of the ultra-lean mixture and sustainability of the combustion process. There is a lack of fundamental studies on chemical kinetics of ultra-lean methane combustion and reliable kinetic schemes that can be used together with computational fluid dynamics studies to design and develop advanced mitigation systems. Mitigation of methane as a greenhouse gas calls for more efforts on understanding ultra-lean combustion. Recuperative combustion provides a promising means for mitigating ultra-lean methane emissions. Progress is needed on effective methods to ignite and to recuperate and retain heat for oxidation/combustion of the ultra-lean mixtures. Catalysts can be very effective in reducing the temperatures required for oxidation while plasmas may be utilised to assist the ignition, but thermodynamic/aerodynamic limits of burning ultra-lean methane remain unexplored.

     "abstract": "Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) has arisen during last years as a very promising combustion technology for power plants and industrial applications, with inherent CO2 capture which reduces the energy penalty imposed on other competing technologies. The use of solid fuels in CLC has been highly developed in the last decade and currently stands at a technical readiness level (TRL) of 6. In this paper, experience gained during CLC operation in continuous units is reviewed and appraised, focusing mainly on technical and environmental issues relating to the use of solid fuels. Up to now, more than 2700\u202fh of operational experience has been reported in 19 pilot plants ranging from 0.5\u202fkWth to 4\u202fMWth. When designing a CLC unit of solid fuels, the preferred configuration for the scale-up is a two circulating fluidized beds (CFB) system. Coal has been the most commonly used solid fuel in CLC, but biomass has recently emerged as a very promising option to achieve negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS). Mostly low cost iron and manganese materials have been used as oxygen carriers in the so called in-situ gasification CLC (iG-CLC). The development of Chemical Looping with Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU) makes a qualitative step forward in the solid fuel combustion, due to the use of materials able to release oxygen. The performance and environmental issues of CLC of solid fuels is evaluated here. Regarding environmental aspects, the pollutant emissions (SO2, NOx, etc.) released into the atmosphere from the air reactor are no cause of concern for the environment. However, the presence of SO2, NOx and Hg at the exit of the fuel reactor affects CO2 quality, which must be taken into account during the later compression and purification stages. The effect of the main variables affecting CLC performance is evaluated for fuel conversion, CO2 capture rate, and combustion efficiency obtained in different CLC units. Solid fuel conversion is normally not complete during operation, due to the undesired loss of char. A methodology is presented to extrapolate the current information to what could be expected in a larger CLC system. CO2 capture near 100% has been reported using a highly efficient carbon stripper, highly reactive fuels (such as lignites and biomass, etc.) or by the CLOU process. Operational experience in iG-CLC has showed that it is not possible to reach complete fuel combustion, making an additional oxygen polishing step necessary. For the further scale-up, it is essential to reduce the unburnt compounds at the fuel reactor outlet. Proposals to achieve this reduction already exist and include both improvement to the gas-oxygen carrier contact, or new design concepts based on the current scheme for iG-CLC. In addition, CLOU based on copper materials has shown that complete fuel combustion could be achieved. Main challenges for the future development and scale-up of CLC technology have been also identified. A breakthrough in the future development of CLC technology for solid fuels will come from developing long-life materials for CLOU that are easy to recover from the ash purge stream.",

     "abstract": "Petroleum-derived gasoline is currently the most widely used fuel for transportation propulsion. The design and operation of gasoline fuels is governed by specific physical and chemical kinetic fuel properties. These must be thoroughly understood in order to improve sustainable gasoline fuel technologies in the face of economical, technological, and societal challenges. For this reason, surrogate mixtures are formulated to emulate the thermophysical, thermochemical, and chemical kinetic properties of the real fuel, so that fundamental experiments and predictive simulations can be conducted. Early studies on gasoline combustion typically adopted single component or binary mixtures (n-heptane/isooctane) as surrogates. However, the last decade has seen rapid progress in the formulation and utilization of ternary mixtures (n-heptane/isooctane/toluene), as well as multicomponent mixtures that span the entire carbon number range of gasoline fuels (C4\u2013C10). The increased use of oxygenated fuels (ethanol, butanol, MTBE, etc.) as blending components/additives has also motivated studies on their addition to gasoline fuels. This comprehensive review presents the available experimental and chemical kinetic studies which have been performed to better understand the combustion properties of gasoline fuels and their surrogates. Focus is on the development and use of surrogate fuels that emulate real fuel properties governing the design and operation of engines. A detailed analysis is presented for the various classes of compounds used in formulating gasoline surrogate fuels, including n-paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics. Chemical kinetic models for individual molecules and mixtures of molecules to emulate gasoline surrogate fuels are presented. Despite the recent progress in gasoline surrogate fuel combustion research, there are still major gaps remaining; these are critically discussed, as well as their implications on fuel formulation and engine design.",

     "abstract": "Over the years, the production of waste ash from many sources (e.g. coal, biomass, industrial, animal, and municipal solid waste) and from conventional and renewable energy technologies has increased, generating environmental problems due to the increasing amount of material disposed of in landfills.Fly ash from coal and biomass represent the foremost waste products produced by fossil fuel combustion and alternative natural energy sources, respectively. These waste materials are most widely utilized in agricultural applications, soil stabilization, and the cement and concrete industries. Among the various methods proposed for the reuse of fly ash, conversion to zeolite offers the greatest benefits; the process diverts ash waste materials from disposal sites and transforms them into useful secondary products for applications ranging from environmental mitigation to catalysis. The vast amount of literature on fly ash application is the fruit of growing waste production and the consequent need to find innovative methods to reduce the amount of waste deposited in landfills.This article summarizes studies concerning both coal and biomass fly ash. The characterization and potential applications of these materials are analysed in detail through reference to the numerous studies published on fly ash worldwide over the last number of decades. A considerable number of experiments have been conducted using ash as a raw material for zeolite synthesis, and many others concern the utilization of the newly-formed mineral. This paper discusses the key factors affecting zeolite synthesis, primarily from coal fly ash; the drawbacks of each approach are also analysed.",

Problems occurring during the cold start pose some of the remaining barriers to commercial applications of PEM fuel cells in transportation, stationary, auxiliary and portable systems. Fundamental studies of transport phenomena are critical to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cold start and offer ultimate solutions to resolving cold-start issues. In this review, experimental studies are discussed, focusing on output performance degradation, water and ice visualization, and component damages during a cold start. Analytical, numerical, and microscopic models and their results are also discussed. One of the emphases is on transport phenomena relevant to cold starts, including supercooling, phase change and transport of water in the membrane, catalyst layer, microporous layer, and gas diffusion layer. Another emphasis is placed on the strategies utilized to optimize cold-start processes for improved performance. The strategies include material designs of the components, cell/stack structures, and startup mode/load controls. It is shown that all of the effective strategies to mitigating cold-start problems derive from a basic understanding of the transport mechanisms during a cold start. It is also suggested that future models for this problem should place a great deal of attention in supercooling phenomena and water phase-change and transport in multilayer porous media.

     "abstract": "The bulk motion of fluid and diffusive transport within fluid are two processes during natural or forced convection. The complexity of the convective heat flow is realized since last few decades and the analysis of the heat flow as well as thermal characteristics gradually becomes cumbersome. Although earlier researchers studied convective heat flow via velocity profiles, streamlines and isotherms, these tools were not enough for the efficient visualization of the unique features of convection heat flow. An efficient tool, termed as \u2018heatline\u2019 (mathematically represented as heatfunction) was first proposed by Kimura and Bejan in 1983 for the heat flow visualization during convective heat flow. The aim of this article is to review existing works on \u2018heatline\u2019 involving various physical systems. The mathematical implications of heatfunctions based on derivations of governing equations and boundary conditions for heatfunctions are presented in detail. The non-homogeneous boundary conditions for heatfunctions arise due to hot or cold or adiabatic walls as well as the junction between the walls and these conditions vary with the location of the reference or datum of the heatfunction. The physics on the heat flow via \u2018heatlines\u2019 are found to be invariant with the locations of the reference value of the heatfunction. The heat flow visualization is analyzed for various test cases from simple one dimensional boundary layer problem to convection in two dimensional complex cavities. The detailed explanations of earlier works on \u2018heatlines\u2019 during one dimensional flow involving forced or natural convection with various applications are discussed. Further, applications of \u2018heatlines\u2019 during convective heat flow within enclosed cavities involving uniform or non uniform heating of walls, discrete heating or cooling, conjugate convection and mixed convection are discussed and \u2018heatlines\u2019 are found to be successful to demonstrate various complex heat flow paths and multiple heat flow circulation cells. Overall, the analysis of convective heat flow from simple to complicated geometries via \u2018heatline\u2019 is crucial for the visualization of the thermal transport, mixing and efficient thermal management.",

     "abstract": "The development of technologies to hybridise concentrating solar thermal energy (CST) and combustion technologies, is driven by the potential to provide both cost-effective CO2 mitigation and firm supply. Hybridisation, which involves combining the two energy sources within a single plant, offers these benefits over the stand-alone counterparts through the use of shared infrastructure and increased efficiency. In the near-term, hybrids between solar and fossil fuelled systems without carbon capture offer potential to lower the use of fossil fuels, while in the longer term they offer potential for low-cost carbon-neutral or carbon-negative energy. The integration of CST into CO2 capture technologies such as oxy-fuel combustion and chemical looping combustion is potentially attractive because the same components can be used for both CO2 capture and the storage of solar energy, to reduce total infrastructure and cost. The use of these hybrids with biomass and/or renewable fuels, offers the additional potential for carbon-negative energy with relatively low cost. In addition to reviewing these technologies, we propose a methodology for classifying solar-combustion hybrid technologies and assess the progress and challenges of each.

     "abstract": "The pursuit of future energy systems that can meet electricity demands while supporting the attainment of societal environment goals, including mitigating climate change and reducing pollution in the air, has led to questions regarding the viability of continued use of natural gas. Natural gas use, particularly for electricity generation, has increased in recent years due to enhanced resource availability from non-traditional reserves and pressure to reduce greenhouse gasses (GHG) from higher-emitting sources, including coal generation. While lower than coal emissions, current natural gas power generation strategies primarily utilize combustion with higher emissions of GHG and criteria pollutants than other low-carbon generation options, including renewable resources. Furthermore, emissions from life cycle stages of natural gas production and distribution can have additional detrimental GHG and air quality (AQ) impacts. On the other hand, natural gas power generation can play an important role in supporting renewable resource integration by (1) providing essential load balancing services, and (2) supporting the use of gaseous renewable fuels through the existing infrastructure of the natural gas system. Additionally, advanced technologies and strategies including fuel cells and combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) systems can facilitate natural gas generation with low emissions and high efficiencies. Thus, the role of natural gas generation in the context of GHG mitigation and AQ improvement is complex and multi-faceted, requiring consideration of more than simple quantification of total or net emissions. If appropriately constructed and managed, natural gas generation could support and advance sustainable and renewable energy. In this paper, a review of the literature regarding emissions from natural gas with a focus on power generation is conducted and discussed in the context of GHG and AQ impacts. In addition, a pathway forward is proposed for natural gas generation and infrastructure to maximize environmental benefits and support renewable resources in the attainment of emission reductions.",

     "abstract": "Optical diagnostics for fluid temperature measurements continue to further our understanding of flows involving heat transfer and/or chemical reactions, which are intrinsic to key areas including energy production, the process industries, transportation, heating/cooling systems and naturally-occurring thermal convection. Besides temperature, all flows must also be described by their velocity. As these flows are often turbulent, an important capability is to measure both velocity and temperature at the same time to capture, for example, the turbulent heat flux term appearing in the energy conservation equation.This paper reviews temperature measurement techniques for fluid flows that are based on thermographic phosphors, which are materials that possess temperature-dependent luminescence properties. Phosphor particles are seeded into the fluid flow of interest. Following laser excitation, the luminescence of the particles is detected, and the temperature measurement is derived using either the spectral intensity ratio or the lifetime. The same particles can also be used for velocity measurements using well-established particle-based approaches, such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) or particle image velocimetry (PIV), producing instantaneously correlated vector-scalar data. First introduced over a decade ago, this concept has since evolved and is currently capable of two-dimensional measurements in the temperature range 200\u2013900\u00a0K. At lower temperatures a single-shot spatial precision better than 4\u00a0K is possible, as is imaging at sampling rates in the multi-kHz range. The approach is flexible, allowing, for example, techniques which probe single particles for point measurements with a 200\u00a0\u00b5m spatial resolution. Besides many validation experiments, the method has been applied in internal combustion engines, a falling film absorber, a high-pressure reaction vessel and in enclosed wind tunnels to study various turbulent heat transfer and reactive flow phenomena.The objective of this article is to provide the first review of this emerging field. The focus is on 1) the method: how has the principle of phosphor thermometry been used for flow measurements, and what instrumentation and processing steps were implemented; 2) how phosphor particles were characterised, and which phosphors are best-suited to temperature measurements in flows; and 3) the applications of the technique. Throughout, and with a detailed analysis of various sources of error, the review endeavours to compare the work and identify common aspects, advantages and limitations of the studies that led to successful flow measurements, and therefore should serve as a guide for researchers using the method. The article also briefly summarises the various challenges which the authors consider are key to the future development of these diagnostics.",

     "abstract": "Rapid compression machines (RCMs) are widely used to acquire experimental insights into fuel autoignition and pollutant formation chemistry, especially at conditions relevant to current and future combustion technologies. RCM studies emphasize important experimental regimes, characterized by low- to intermediate-temperatures (600\u20131200\u00a0K) and moderate to high pressures (5\u201380\u00a0bar). At these conditions, which are directly relevant to modern combustion schemes including low temperature combustion (LTC) for internal combustion engines and dry low emissions (DLE) for gas turbine engines, combustion chemistry exhibits complex and experimentally challenging behaviors such as the chemistry attributed to cool flame behavior and the negative temperature coefficient regime. Challenges for studying this regime include that experimental observations can be more sensitive to coupled physical-chemical processes leading to phenomena such as mixed deflagrative/autoignitive combustion. Experimental strategies which leverage the strengths of RCMs have been developed in recent years to make RCMs particularly well suited for elucidating LTC and DLE chemistry, as well as convolved physical-chemical processes.Specifically, this work presents a review of experimental and computational efforts applying RCMs to study autoignition phenomena, and the insights gained through these efforts. A brief history of RCM development is presented towards the steady improvement in design, characterization, instrumentation and data analysis. Novel experimental approaches and measurement techniques, coordinated with computational methods are described which have expanded the utility of RCMs beyond empirical studies of explosion limits to increasingly detailed understanding of autoignition chemistry and the role of physical-chemical interactions. Fundamental insight into the autoignition chemistry of specific fuels is described, demonstrating the extent of knowledge of low-temperature chemistry derived from RCM studies, from simple hydrocarbons to multi-component blends and full-boiling range fuels. Emerging needs and further opportunities are suggested, including investigations of under-explored fuels and the implementation of increasingly higher fidelity diagnostics.",

     "abstract": "It is widely accepted that greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, must be significantly reduced to prevent catastrophic global warming. Carbon capture and reliable storage (CCS) is one path towards controlling emissions, and serves as a key component to climate change mitigation and will serve as a bridge between the fossil fuel energy of today and the renewable energy of the future. Although fossil-fueled power plants emit the vast majority of stationary CO2, there are many industries that emit purer streams of CO2, which result in reduced cost for separation. Moreover, many industries outside of electricity generation do not have ready alternatives for becoming low-carbon and CCS may be their only option. The thermodynamic minimum work for separation was calculated for a variety of CO2 emissions streams from various industries, followed by a Sherwood analysis of capture cost. The Sherwood plot correlates the relationship between concentrations of a target substance with the cost to separate it from the remaining components. As the target concentration increases, the cost to separate decreases on a molar basis. Furthermore, the lowest cost opportunities for deploying first-of-a-kind CCS technology were found to be in the Midwest and along the Gulf Coast. Many high purity industries, such as ethanol production, ammonia production and natural gas processing, are located in these regions. The southern Midwest and Gulf Coast are also co-located with potential geologic sequestration sites and enhanced oil recovery opportunities. As a starting point, these sites may provide the demonstration and knowledge necessary for reducing carbon capture technology costs across all industries, and improving the economic viability for CCS and climate change mitigation. The various industries considered in this review were examined from a dilution and impact perspective to determine the best path forward in terms of prioritizing for carbon capture. A possible implementation pathway is presented that initially focuses on CO2 capture from ethanol production, followed by the cement industry, ammonia, and then natural gas processing and ethylene oxide production. While natural gas processing and ethylene oxide production produce high purity streams, they only account for relatively small portions of industrial process CO2. Finally, petroleum refineries account for almost a fifth of industrial process CO2, but are comprised of numerous low-purity CO2 streams. These qualities make these three industries less attractive for initial CC implementation, and better suited for consideration towards the end of the industrial CC pathway.",

Various methods such as homogeneous acid- and alkali-catalyzed transesterification, heterogeneous acid and alkali-catalyzed transesterification, enzyme-catalyzed transesterification, and supercritical reactions have been employed so far to synthesize biodiesel. Herein, we review the reaction mechanisms and experimental results for these approaches. Recently, supercritical biodiesel production has undergone a vigorous development as the technology offers several advantages over other methods, including the fact that it does not require a catalyst, short residence time, high reaction rate, no pretreatment requirement, and applicability to a wide variety of feedstock. This technology was first designed for biodiesel production using methanol and ethanol. Biodiesel production without glycerol as a byproduct is attractive and has been achieved using supercritical methyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Most recently, biodiesel production in supercritical tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) has been developed also. In this review, supercritical biodiesel production will be discussed in detail. Empirical rate expressions are derived for biodiesel production in supercritical methanol, ethanol, methyl acetate, DMC, and MTBE in this study for the first time. These rate equations are critical to predicting biodiesel yields and to comparing the reaction behaviors in different solvents. Lastly challenges for improving energy recovery in supercritical biodiesel production and recommendations for future work are provided.",

     "abstract": "Underground coal thermal treatment (UCTT) is a promising concept that was recently proposed for extracting high-value hydrocarbon fuels from deep coal seams, which are economically unattractive for mining. UCTT is essentially an in situ pyrolysis process that converts underground coals into synthetic liquid and gaseous fuels, while leaving most of the carbon underground as a char matrix. The produced synthetic fuels have higher H/C ratios than coals. The remaining char matrix is an ideal reservoir for CO2 sequestration because pyrolysis significantly increases the surface area of the char. The UCTT concept is relatively new, and there is little research in this area. However, underground oil shale retorting, which is also an in-situ hydrocarbon fuels conversion process, shares key features with UCTT and has gained momentum in demonstration and commercial development. As such, there is a large body of literature available in this area. A review of the studies on underground oil shale retorting that are closely related to UCTT will shed light on the UCTT process. This paper presents a review of the recent literature on underground oil shale retorting that are most relevant to UCTT process. The review provides a background to the reader by comparing the properties of coal with oil shale, with an emphasis on the feasibility of applying oil shale retorting techniques to UCTT process. The review further discusses the coal and oil shale conversion issues and uses the knowledge of the latter as guidance for the development of UCTT. Published data on pyrolysis of large coal blocks at conditions relevant to UCTT process is scarce. Therefore, literature on conventional coal pyrolysis is reviewed for optimization of the UCTT process. Despite the abundant studies on pulverized coal pyrolysis, there are still many open questions on whether they can be directly applied to UCTT. A comparison of the unique environment of UCTT with conditions of conventional pulverized coal pyrolysis clearly shows there are knowledge gaps. Future research needs are then proposed to close these gaps.",

     "abstract": "The past decades have seen increasing interest in developing pyrolysis pathways to produce biofuels and bio-based chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. Pyrolysis is a key stage in other thermochemical conversion processes, such as combustion and gasification. Understanding the reaction mechanisms of biomass pyrolysis will facilitate the process optimization and reactor design of commercial-scale biorefineries. However, the multiscale complexity of the biomass structures and reactions involved in pyrolysis make it challenging to elucidate the mechanism. This article provides a broad review of the state-of-art biomass pyrolysis research. Considering the complexity of the biomass structure, the pyrolysis characteristics of its three major individual components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) are discussed in detail. Recently developed experimental technologies, such as Py-GC\u2013MS/FID, TG-MS/TG-FTIR, in situ spectroscopy, 2D-PCIS, isotopic labeling method, in situ EPR and PIMS have been employed for biomass pyrolysis research, including online monitoring of the evolution of key intermediate products and the qualitative and quantitative measurement of the pyrolysis products. Based on experimental results, many macroscopic kinetic modeling methods with comprehensive mechanism schemes, such as the distributed activation energy model (DAEM), isoconversional method, detailed lumped kinetic model, kinetic Monte Carlo model, have been developed to simulate the mass loss behavior during biomass pyrolysis and to predict the resulting product distribution. Combined with molecular simulations of the elemental reaction routes, an in-depth understanding of the biomass pyrolysis mechanism may be obtained. Aiming to further improve the quality of pyrolysis products, the effects of various catalytic methods and feedstock pretreatment technologies on the pyrolysis behavior are also reviewed. At last, a brief conclusion for the challenge and perspectives of biomass pyrolysis is provided.",

     "abstract": "Li\u2013air batteries have potential to be the next generation power sources for various applications, from portable devices to electric vehicles and microgrids, due largely to their significantly higher theoretical energy densities than those of the existing batteries. The commercialization of this technology, however, is hindered by a variety of technical hurdles, including low obtainable capacity, poor energy efficiency, and limited cycle life. Breakthrough to these barriers requires a fundamental understanding of the complex electrochemical and transport behaviors inside the batteries. Mathematical modeling and simulation are imperative in gaining important insight into the mechanisms of these complex phenomena, which is vital to achieving rational designs of better materials for high-performance batteries. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the latest advances in modeling and simulation of Li\u2013air batteries and offer our perspectives on new directions of future development. Unlike previous reviews that centered mainly on continuum modeling of non-aqueous Li\u2013air batteries, the present paper focuses on mathematical descriptions of the detailed transport and electrochemical processes in different types of Li\u2013air batteries. We start with a brief introduction to the working principles of Li\u2013air batteries. Then, the governing equations for mass transport and electrochemical reactions in non-aqueous Li\u2013air batteries are formulated, including lithium ion and oxygen transport in the porous air electrode, the formation of solid discharge products, the kinetics of electrode reactions, the evolution of electrode structure, the distribution of active sites, the effect of the side reactions during cycling, the phenomena of the volume change, and the charge process. In addition, the mo\\deling and simulations of aqueous and hybrid Li\u2013air batteries are reviewed, highlighting the phenomena that are different from those in the non-aqueous ones. Finally, the challenges facing the modeling and simulation of Li\u2013air batteries are discussed and perspectives for the development of a new generation of Li\u2013air batteries are outlined.",

We highlight R&D avenues offering particularly promising development opportunities together with the intrinsic limitations of the different approaches.

     "abstract": "Universal concerns about degradation in ambient environment, stringent emission legislations, depletion of petroleum reserves, security of fuel supply and global warming have motivated research and development of engines operating on alternative combustion concepts, which also have capability of using renewable as well as conventional fuels. Low temperature combustion (LTC) is an advanced combustion concept for internal combustion (IC) engines, which has attracted global attention in recent years. LTC concept is different from the conventional spark ignition (SI) combustion as well as compression ignition (CI) diffusion combustion concepts. LTC technology offers prominent benefits in terms of simultaneous reduction of both oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), in addition to reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC). However, controlling ignition timing and combustion rate are primary challenges to be tackled before LTC technology can be implemented in automotive engines commercially. This review covers fundamental aspects of development of LTC engines and its evolution, historical background and origin of LTC concept, encompassing LTC principle, its advantages, challenges and prospects. Detailed insights into preparation of homogeneous charge by external and internal measures for mineral diesel and gasoline like fuels are covered. Fuel requirements and fuel induction system design aspect for LTC engines are also discussed. Combustion characteristics of LTC engines including combustion chemistry, heat release rate (HRR), combustion duration, knock characteristics, high load limit, fuel conversion efficiencies and combustion instability are summarized. Emission characteristics are reviewed along with insights into PM and NOx emissions from LTC engines. Finally, different strategies for controlling combustion rate and combustion timings for gasoline and mineral diesel like fuels are discussed, showing the way forward for this technology in future towards its commercialization.",

These applications represent three major directions that enable the membrane-based oxy-fuel combustion technology, the clean and efficient chemical to electrical energy conversion, and the production of higher value-added chemicals from lower value raw materials. The attractiveness of perovskite oxides arises from the possibility to incorporate different A-site and B-site metal elements into their ABO3-\u03b4 lattice to form essentially A1-xA\u2019xB1-yB\u2019yO3-\u03b4 compound which allows tailoring of the oxygen non-stoichiometry (and thus the oxygen ionic conductivity), the oxygen reduction reaction activity, and the electronic conductivity to fit a particular application. This paper reviews the basic aspects and progresses in these three directions.

     "abstract": "Biodiesel is receiving serious attention globally as a potential alternative fuel for replacing mineral diesel, partially or fully. In this review paper, most prominent methods of biodiesel production commercially, life-cycle analysis and economic issues related to biodiesel, engine performance, combustion and emission characteristics including particulate, engine compatibility issues and effect of biodiesel usage on engine component wear and lubricating oil are comprehensively discussed. Majority of biodiesel produced globally is via base-catalyzed transesterification process since this is a low temperature and pressure process, having high conversion rates without intermediate steps, and it uses inexpensive materials of construction for the plant. Catalyst types (alkaline, acidic or enzymatic), catalyst concentration, molar ratio of alcohol/oil, reaction temperature, moisture content of reactants, and free fatty acid (FFA) content of oil are the main factors affecting biodiesel (ester) yield from the transesterification process. Substantial reduction in particulate matter (PM), total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions in comparison to mineral diesel, and increased brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emissions are reported by most researchers using unmodified compression ignition (CI) engines. This review covers several aspects, which are not covered by previous review articles, such as effect of biodiesel on unregulated emissions, effect of biodiesel on carbon deposits, wear of key engine components, and lubricating oil in long-term endurance studies. It emerges from literature review that even minor blends of biodiesel help control emissions and ease pressure on scarce petroleum resources without sacrificing engine power output, engine performance and fuel economy. This review underscores that future studies should focus on optimization of fuel injection equipment and hardware modifications to develop dedicated biodiesel engines, improve low temperature performance of biodiesel fuelled engines, develop new biodiesel compatible lubricating oil formulations and special materials for engine components before implementing large-scale substitution of mineral diesel by biodiesel globally.",

Integrated biogas fuel cell plants in wastewater treatment plants and other bioenergy recovery plants are nowadays on the verge of becoming a clear opportunity for the market entry of high-temperature fuel cells in distributed generation (power production from a few kW to the MW scale).High-temperature fuel cell technologies like molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are especially fit to operate with carbon fuels due to their (direct or indirect) internal reforming capability. Especially, systems based on SOFC technology show the highest conversion efficiency of gaseous carbon fuels (e.g., natural gas, digester gas, and biomass-derived syngas) into electricity when compared to engines or gas turbines. Also, lower CO2 emissions and ultra-low emissions of atmospheric contaminants (SOX, CO, VOC, especially NOX) are generated per unit of electricity output. Nonetheless, stringent requirements apply regarding fuel purity. The presence of contaminants within the anode fuel stream, even at trace levels (sometimes ppb levels) can reduce the lifetime of key components like the fuel cell stack and reformer. In this work, we review the complex matrix (typology and amount) of different contaminants that is found in different biogas types (anaerobic digestion gas and landfill gas). We analyze the impact of contaminants on the fuel reformer and the SOFC stack to identify the threshold limits of the fuel cell system towards specific contaminants. Finally, technological solutions and related adsorbent materials to remove contaminants in a dedicated clean-up unit upstream of the fuel cell plant are also reviewed.",

     "abstract": "Boundary layer flashback in premixed jet flames has been the subject of detailed experimental and numerical investigation since the 1940\u2032s. The traditional approach for characterizing flashback has involved the critical velocity gradient concept, with higher values indicating a higher flashback propensity for a given situation. Recent studies in confined configurations have illustrated that a key assumption underlying the critical velocity gradient concept, namely a lack of interaction between the flame and the approaching flow, is fundamentally incorrect. However, for unconfined configurations, where this interaction is much less important, the critical velocity gradient concept is able to partially capture flashback characteristics. Historically, the critical velocity gradient concept predicts trends of flashback behavior in laminar configurations for a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and fuel compositions more consistently than in turbulent configurations. This is due in part to the fact that many laminar studies establish well behaved velocity conditions in the tube conveying the premixed reactants to the reaction zone. Yet many important practical systems are in the turbulent regime and cannot be approximated by a simplified analysis. Studies to date in either regime, while numerous, generally do not provide a comprehensive methodology for accounting for all parameters. Recent work has attempted to capture the effect of a large number of these parameters in the turbulent regime, with some emphasis on providing design tools that can be used to estimate flashback propensity in more general terms. These approaches have demonstrated reasonable performance for the limited data available at elevated temperature and pressure which are representative of important practical system such as lean premixed combustors for gas turbines. While progress has been made in the last few years relative to predicting flashback for practical systems with high Reynolds numbers, only limited data are available for developing and validating correlations. Open questions remain in terms of using detailed numerical simulations and complex reaction chemistry to predict flashback for unconfined flames. In addition, flame-wall interaction in terms of heat transfer, sensitivity to turbulence levels, the role of general velocity gradients (vs idealized fully developed flow), and the role of high pressure must be further evaluated.",

     "abstract": "Knocking combustion research is crucially important because it determines engine durability, fuel consumption, and power density, as well as noise and emission performance. Current spark ignition (SI) engines suffer from both conventional knock and super-knock. Conventional knock limits raising the compression ratio to improve thermal efficiency due to end-gas auto-ignition, while super-knock limits the desired boost to improve the power density of modern gasoline engines due to detonation. Conventional combustion has been widely studied for many years. Although the basic characteristics are clear, the correlation between the knock index and fuel chemistry, pressure oscillations and heat transfer, and auto-ignition front propagation, are still in early stages of understanding. Super-knock combustion in highly boosted spark ignition engines with random pre-ignition events has been intensively studied in the past decade in both academia and industry. These works have mainly focused on the relationship between pre-ignition and super-knock, source analyses of pre-ignition, and the effects of oil/fuel properties on super-knock. The mechanism of super-knock has been recently revealed in rapid compression machines (RCM) under engine-like conditions. It was found that detonation can occur in modern internal combustion engines under high energy density conditions. Thermodynamic conditions and shock waves influence the combustion wave and detonation initiation modes. Three combustion wave modes in the end gas have been visualized as deflagration, sequential auto-ignition and detonation. The most frequently observed detonation initiation mode is shock wave reflection-induced detonation (SWRID). Compared to the effect of shock compression and negative temperature coefficient (NTC) combustion on ignition delay, shock wave reflection is the main cause of near-wall auto-ignition/detonation. Finally, suppression methods for conventional knock and super-knock in SI engines are reviewed, including use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), the injection strategy, and the integration of a high tumble - high EGR-Atkinson/Miller cycle. This paper provides deep insights into the processes occurring during knocking combustion in spark ignition engines. Furthermore, knock control strategies and combustion wave modes are summarized, and future research directions, such as turbulence-shock-reaction interaction theory, detonation suppression and utilization, and super-knock solutions, are also discussed.",

Significant thermodynamic studies for each biofuel are also examined. Syngas cleaning is demonstrated to be a critical issue for biofuel production, and innovative pathways such as those employed by Choren Industrietechnik, Germany, and BioMCN, the Netherlands, are shown to allow efficient methanol generation. The conversion of syngas to FT transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel over Co or Fe catalysts is reviewed and demonstrated to be a promising option for the future of biofuels.

However, suitable process configurations resulting in optimal plant designs are crucial, so detailed process integration is a powerful tool to optimize current and develop new processes.

Of all the laser-diagnostic techniques, LAS is arguably the most versatile and quantitative, as it has been used extensively to provide quantitative, species-specific measurements of gas temperature, pressure, composition and velocity in both laboratory- and industrial-scale systems. Historically, most IR-LAS work has been conducted using tunable diode lasers; however, today\u2019s researchers have access to a wide range of light sources that provide unique sensing capabilities and convenient access to nearly the entire IR spectrum (\u2248 0.8 to 16\u00a0\u00b5m).

     "abstract": "At a first glance, ethanol, toluene and methyl tert-butyl ether look nothing alike with respect to their molecular structures. Nevertheless, all share a similarly high octane number. A comprehensive review of the inner workings of such octane boosters has been long overdue, particularly at a time when feedstocks for transport fuels other than crude oil, such as natural gas and biomass, are enjoying a rapidly growing market share.As high octane fuels sell at a considerable premium over gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, new entrants into the refining business should take note and gear their processes towards knock resistant compounds if they are to maximize their respective bottom lines. Starting from crude oil, the route towards this goal is well established. Starting from biomass or natural gas, however, it is less clear what dots on the horizon to aim for.The goal of this paper is to offer insight into the chemistry behind octane boosters and to subsequently distill from this knowledge, taking into account recent advances in engine technology, multiple generic design rules that guarantee good anti-knock performance.Careful analysis of the literature suggests that highly unsaturated (cyclic) compounds are the preferred octane boosters for modern spark-ignition engines. Additional side chains of any variety will dilute this strong performance. Multi-branched paraffins come in distant second place, owing to their negligible sensitivity. Depending on the type and location of functional oxygen groups, oxygenates can have a beneficial, neutral or detrimental impact on anti-knock quality.",

     "abstract": "Large-scale atmospheric removal of greenhouse gases (GHGs) including methane, nitrous oxide and ozone-depleting halocarbons could reduce global warming more quickly than atmospheric removal of CO2. Photocatalysis of methane oxidizes it to CO2, effectively reducing its global warming potential (GWP) by at least 90%. Nitrous oxide can be reduced to nitrogen and oxygen by photocatalysis; meanwhile halocarbons can be mineralized by red-ox photocatalytic reactions to acid halides and CO2. Photocatalysis avoids the need for capture and sequestration of these atmospheric components. Here review an unusual hybrid device combining photocatalysis with carbon-free electricity with no-intermittency based on the solar updraft chimney. Then we review experimental evidence regarding photocatalytic transformations of non-CO2 GHGs. We propose to combine TiO2-photocatalysis with solar chimney power plants (SCPPs) to cleanse the atmosphere of non-CO2 GHGs. Worldwide installation of 50,000 SCPPs, each of capacity 200\u00a0MW, would generate a cumulative 34\u00a0PWh of renewable electricity by 2050, taking into account construction time. These SCPPs equipped with photocatalyst would process 1\u00a0atmospheric volume each 14\u201316 years, reducing or stopping the atmospheric growth rate of the non-CO2 GHGs and progressively reducing their atmospheric concentrations. Removal of methane, as compared to other GHGs, has enhanced efficacy in reducing radiative forcing because it liberates more \u00b0OH radicals to accelerate the cleaning of the troposphere. The overall reduction in non-CO2 GHG concentration would help to limit global temperature rise. By physically linking greenhouse gas removal to renewable electricity generation, the hybrid concept would avoid the moral hazard associated with most other climate engineering proposals.",

     "abstract": "Official laboratory-measured monitoring data indicate a progressive decline in the average fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of the European passenger car fleet. There is increasing evidence to suggest that officially reported CO2 values do not reflect the actual performance of the vehicles on the road. A reported difference of 30\u201340% between official values and real-world estimates was found which has been continuously increasing. This paper reviews the influence of different factors that affect fuel consumption and CO2 emissions on the road and in the laboratory. Factors such as driving behaviour, vehicle configuration and traffic conditions are reconfirmed as highly influential. Neglected factors (e.g. side winds, rain, road grade), which may have significant contributions in fuel consumption in real world driving are identified. The margins of the present certification procedure contribute between 10 and 20% in the gap between the reported values and reality. The latter was estimated to be of the order of 40%, or 47.5\u00a0gCO2/km for 2015 average fleet emissions, but could range up to 60% or down to 19% depending on prevailing traffic conditions. The introduction of a new test protocol is expected to bridge about half of the present divergence between laboratory and real world. Finally, substantial literature was found on the topic; however, the lack of common test procedures, analysis tools, and coordinated activity across different countries point out the need for additional research in order to support targeted actions for real world CO2 reduction. Quality checks of the CO2 certification procedure, and the reported values, combined with in-use consumption monitoring could be used to assess the gap on a continuous basis.",

     "abstract": "Optical imaging techniques are ubiquitous for the resolution of non-uniformities in gas flows. Planar imaging techniques such as laser-induced fluorescence are well established and applied extensively in turbulent reactive flows, offering both high temporal and spatial resolutions. However, planar imaging suffers from a critical disadvantage, the requirement for spatially continuous optical access over large solid angles in both the excitation and detection paths and this precludes their application in many practical situations, for example those encountered in engine testing. Tomographic absorption spectroscopy, TAS, on the other hand, shares many of the advantages of planar imaging techniques but reduces the demands for optical access, because high quality data can be obtained with sparsely sampled volumes. The technique has unrivalled potential for imaging in harsh environments, for example for in-cylinder/in-chamber engine measurements. TAS is beginning to mature as a technique for the simultaneous imaging of temperature and species concentration, and is experiencing a surge of interest due to progress in laser technology, spectroscopy, and theoretical developments of nonlinear tomography techniques. The recent advancements in broad bandwidth, frequency-agile laser sources massively enrich the spectral information obtainable in TAS. Furthermore, nonlinear tomography enables the recovery of multiplexed information from a single tomographic inversion. The utilization of multispectral information improves the immunity of TAS to experimental noise and makes possible the simultaneous imaging of temperature, pressure, and multiple species. Nonlinear tomography can also be used to empower the imaging potential of sensitive and robust absorption techniques, such as wavelength modulation spectroscopy, for use in harsh and even optically dense environments. In combination, this greatly extends the applicability of TAS for more general and harsh scenarios in combustion technology. In this article we review basic concepts and mathematical foundations of classical absorption tomography, proceeding to more advanced recent concepts based on nonlinear tomography, and providing an extensive review of experimental demonstrations and practical applications in the context of state-of-the-art combustion research.",

The additives reviewed herein were classified into five categories, i.e., oxygenated additives, metallic and non-metallic based additives, water, antioxidants, and polymeric-based additives. The effects of each category on the engine performance (i.e., brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) and brake thermal efficiency (bte)) and emissions (i.e., CO, NOx, HC, and PM) were exclusively summarized and discussed. Furthermore, various strategies used for adding water like water-diesel emulsion, direct water injection, and adding water into the inlet manifold were illustrated and their pros and cons were completely scrutinized. Finally, opportunities and limitations of each additive considering both engine performance and combustion benignity were outlined to guide future research and development in the domain.",

The fatty acid esters that thus comprise biodiesel largely determine many important fuel properties. In turn, the composition of the biodiesel depends on the composition of the parent feedstock because feedstocks with widely varying fatty acid composition can be used for biodiesel production. The use of different feedstocks is also significant under aspects of increasing biodiesel supply and socio-economic issues. In this article, biodiesel production is briefly described, followed by a discussion of biodiesel fuel properties and the influence of varying fatty acid profiles and feedstocks. It is shown that the properties of biodiesel least influenced by minor components can be determined by a straightforward equation in which the properties of the biodiesel fuel are calculated from the amounts of the individual component fatty esters and their properties. Optimizing biodiesel composition is also addressed.",

The review covers the following aspects: (\u0456) liquid jet primary breakup regimes, (\u0456\u0456) liquid jet trajectory and penetration, (\u0456\u0456\u0456) liquid jet breakup length, and (\u0456v) droplets features and formation mechanisms. The focus is on analyzing the role of different prominent parameters which include gaseous and liquid properties, and liquid injector geometry. The review revealed that gas Weber number plays a crucial role in defining non-turbulent primary breakup regimes, while liquid jet Weber number is of great importance for the transition to turbulent primary breakup. Jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio is the most important parameter for predicting the trajectory, penetration, and breakup length of a liquid jet in a crossflow. The characteristics of droplets disintegrated during the primary breakup are mostly influenced by the nozzle exit conditions, whereas the characteristics of droplets produced via the secondary breakup are strongly dependent on the velocity of cross airflow. Although the review revealed that substantial progress has been made in understanding this complex two-phase flow phenomenon, there still remain several shortcomings which require further research.",

     "publication date": "11-2016",
     "abstract": "Flamelet based chemical reduction techniques are very promising methods for efficient and accurate modeling of premixed flames. Over the years the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) technique has been developed by the Combustion Technology Group of Eindhoven University of Technology. Current state-of-the-art of FGM for the modeling of premixed and partially-premixed flames is reviewed. The fundamental basis of FGM consists of a generalized description of the flame front in a (possibly moving) flame-adapted coordinate system. The basic nature of the generalized flamelet model is that effects of strong stretch in turbulent flames are taken into account by resolving the detailed structure of flame stretch and curvature inside the flame front. The generalized flamelet model, which forms the basis on which FGM is built, is derived in Part I. To be able to validate numerical results of flames obtained with full chemistry and obtained from FGM, it is important that the generalized flamelet model is analyzed further. This is done by investigating the impact of strong stretch, curvature and preferential diffusion effects on the flame dynamics as described by the local mass burning rate. This so-called strong stretch theory is derived and analyzed in Part I, as well as multiple simplifications of it, to compare the strong stretch theory with existing stretch theories. The results compare well with numerical results for flames with thin reaction layers, but described by multiple-species transport and chemistry. This opens the way to use the generalized flamelet model as a firm basis for applying FGM in strongly stretched laminar and turbulent flames in Part II. The complete FGM model is derived first and the use of FGM in practice is reviewed. The FGM model is then validated by studying effects of flame stretch, heat loss, and changes in elements, as well as NO formation. The application to direct numerical simulations of turbulent flames is subsequently studied and validated using the strong stretch theory. It is shown that the generalized flamelet model still holds even in case of strong stretch and curvature effects, at least as long as the reaction layer is dominated by reaction and diffusion phenomena and not perturbed too much by stretch related perturbations. The FGM model then still performs very well with a low number of control variables. Turbulent flames with strong preferential diffusion effects can also be modeled efficiently with an FGM model using a single additional control variable for the changes in element mass fractions and enthalpy. Finally FGM is applied to the modeling of turbulent flames using LES and RANS flow solvers. For these cases, the flame front structure is not resolved anymore and unresolved terms need to be modeled. A common approach to include unresolved turbulent fluctuations is the presumed probability density function (PDF) approach. The validity of this FGM-PDF approach is discussed for a few test cases with increasing level of complexity.",

     "abstract": "The RDX, HMX, and AP are currently the most widely used energetic ingredients in composite solid propellants, since the newly developed energetic compounds are still unable to replace them due to various bottleneck technical problems. In order to improve their combustion efficiency and performance, a common alternative way is to utilize novel nano-sized energetic additives. There are a great many nanomaterials that have been developed in the past decades, which include nanometal particles, metal oxides, metal salts, metallic composites, organometallic compounds, energetic nanocatalysts, and carbon nanomaterials. These additives could increase both the decomposition and the burning rate as well as enhance the combustion efficiency of the corresponding solid propellants by changing the thermal conductivity, energy barrier of thermolysis, heat of reaction, and gas-phase reaction mechanisms of the main ingredients such as RDX, HMX, and AP. This review paper discusses and summarizes the effects of abovementioned nano additives on decomposition kinetics, reaction models, decomposition mechanisms and burning rates, pressure exponents, combustion wave structures, and flame propagation of RDX-, HMX-, and AP-based energetic compositions. The catalytic mechanisms associated with different types of nanomaterials are explained and clarified. Owing to their extremely large specific surface areas, nano-sized energetic additives have significant catalytic effects in both condensed and gas phases during decomposition and subsequent combustion via activation of the reactants and acceleration of their transition state formations. The flame structures of AP-based composite propellants under the effect of some nanoadditives are presented showing the enhanced burning characteristics and stabilized combustion process.",

     "abstract": "Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used in our daily lives. Both light and heat are generated from LED chips and then transmitted or conducted through multiple packaging materials and interfaces. Part of the transmitted light converts into heat along the light propagation; in return, the accumulation of heat leads to the degradation of light output. The accumulated heat negatively influences the reliability and longevity of LEDs, and thus thermal management is critical for LED packaging and applications. On the other hand, in LED packaging processes, many fluid flow problems exist, such as phosphor coating, silicone injection, chip bonding, solder reflow, etc. Among them, phosphor coating is the most important process which is essential for LED performance. Phosphor gel is a kind of non-Newton fluid and its coating process is a typical fluid-flow problem. Overall, since LED packaging and applications present many heat and fluid flow problems, obtaining a full understanding of these problems enables advancements in the development of LED processes and designs. In this review, the emphasis is placed on heat generation in chips, heat flow in packages and application products, fluid flow in phosphor coating process, etc. This is a domain in which significant progress has been achieved in the last decade, and reporting on these advances will facilitate state-of-the-art LED packaging and application technologies.",

     "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is now considered a bridge fuel between present fossil (carbon) economy and desired renewables and this energy molecule is projected to play an important role in the global energy mix well beyond 2035. The atmospheric warming potential of CH4 is 28\u201336 times, when averaged over a 100-year period, that of carbon dioxide (CO2) and this necessitates a close scrutiny of global CH4 emissions inventory. As the second most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), the annual global CH4 emissions were 645 million metric tons (MMT), accounting for 14.3% of the global anthropogenic GHG emissions. Of this, five key anthropogenic sources: agriculture, coal, landfills, oil and gas operations and wastewater together emitted 68% of all CH4 emissions. Landfills are ranked as the third highest anthropogenic CH4 emission source, behind agriculture and coal mines, and emissions from the waste sector are expected to reach almost 800 million metric tons CO2 equivalent (MMTCO2e) in 2015.The two largest economies spewed out 42% (14% (US) and 28% (China)) of the world's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; these two countries are also the largest producers of municipal solid waste (MSW). The United States averages 250 MMT of MSW annually, of which about 63% enters landfills. In 2015, there were 2434 landfills in the United States and CH4 from these landfills accounted for 138 MMTCO2e released into the atmosphere and represents 17.7% of all US CH4 emissions. China had 580 landfills and treated 105\u2009MMT of MSW in 2013. Methane produced from landfills contributes about 13% of total CH4 emissions in China. Almost 50% of landfills in China did not install efficient LFG collection and utilization systems to make them manageable so a great deal of CH4 and CO2 are emitted without intervention. Recent data show that globally, 45 billion cubic meters (bcm) of CH4 or 282 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) was annually released from landfills into the atmosphere. Managing methane emission from landfills is a global challenge, though China lags behind in managed landfills that contribute to adverse health effects on the population. Moreover, the rich organic content of MSW in China indicates that CH4 emissions there may be underestimated. The China unmanaged landfill scenario is further duplicated in developing as well as in least-developed countries.This review starts with a dialog on CH4 emissions and climate change and the chemical changes the CH4 molecule undergoes in the atmosphere (Section 1). Section 2 deals with identification of global CH4 emissions from key sources, particularly anthropogenic, among those are agriculture, coal mines, landfills, oil and gas operations and wastewater. Although each of these sources is descriptive on their own, the focus of Section 3 is on landfills with particular emphasis on the United States and China, two largest producers of waste. The quantitative measurement of CH4 emissions is still uncertain so Section 4 is devoted to various CH4 estimation models, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) LandGEM, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others that are under development. The key landfill emissions data bases and the collection methodologies such as those used in the United States and recently released by the Chinese government are highlighted. Section 5 describes chemistry of pathways that produce CH4 from landfills, and how landfills can control those emissions. Section 6 reviews potential of CH4 as an energy source for combined heat and power (CHP) production as well as pathways for conversion of CH4 into renewable gaseous fuel for use as compressed natural gas (CNG) and clean liquids that could be used as either drop-in replacement (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel hydrocarbons) or advanced oxygenated fuels such as methanol, a versatile precursor to fuels and chemicals, and dimethylether (DME), a clean diesel substitute. Section 7 describes in-place government policies to deal with CH4 emissions from specific sectors. These policies vary from country to country but the Unites States and the European Union (EU) countries are well ahead in curbing methane emissions while China is now playing close attention to its increasing global share of emissions. The last section (Section 8) identifies science and technology and needed policy challenges to manage fugitive methane; this includes identification of technological intervention that China and other countries would need to capitalize on this wasted resource by efficiently harvesting this energy source, needed government policies and science and technology issues that researchers have to deal with to help combat climate change. The overall review provides a comprehensive description that could lead a coherent picture to harvest global CH4 emissions for useful energy, a sensible solution.In 2014, a milestone was reached in US and China relations when the White House announced that the United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%\u201328% below its 2005 level in 2025 while China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. In another 2014 initiative, the United States also identified fugitive methane from oil and gas operations, agriculture, and landfills to maintain respective post-2020 actions on climate change, recognizing that these actions are part of the longer term efforts to transition to low-carbon economies, mindful of containing the global temperature increase goal of 2\u2009\u00b0C, also known as two-degree scenario (2DS). These commitments by the United States and China were evident in the successful agreement at the culmination of the recently concluded COP21 event in Paris. This review is written to start a dialog among researchers that tetrahedral CH4, the simplest among all organic compounds, plays such a complex role in climate change that as its use increases, it will rival carbon dioxide (CO2) in GHG effect in the coming decades if no attempt is made to contain its emissions.",

     "abstract": "In economy nowadays, methanol is already a key compound widely employed as building block for producing intermediates or synthetic hydrocarbons, solvent, energy storage medium, and fuel. This status is expected to last in the near future or even improve to the point of making this compound a central participant in the worldwide economic landscape. For these reasons, every improvement to its production process, in terms of energy savings, optimization, etc., has potential to promote relevant economic benefits. Methanol production comprises three main steps: preparation of syngas, methanol synthesis and downstream separation. This paper aims at reviewing technologies and procedures for modeling and optimizing the second aforementioned phase: the synthesis reactor. Specifically, we focus on packed-bed units, which represent the most widespread technology. In the manuscript, we are going to describe and compare both steady-state and dynamic reactor models as well as analyze typical assumptions and implementation schemes. The kinetics of methanol synthesis is also reported in detail due to a long debate, present in the literature, concerning the real carbon source for methanol, the nature of the active sites and the effect of their morphology and oxidation state.",

Concentrating and non-concentrating collectors have been analyzed, including parabolic dish and parabolic trough collectors from the first category, and flat-plate collectors, air solar heaters, and evacuated tube collectors from the second category. Hybrid photovoltaic/ thermal collectors have also been examined. Applications and processes include the use of phase change materials either in the collection or storage of thermal energy, drying, heating, multigeneration, trigeneration, solar cooling, solar assisted heat pumps, domestic cogeneration, hydrogen production, hybridization with other renewables, solar ponds, power plants and desalination/distillation. Through literature review on the above subjects it is shown that exergy analysis, which gives a representative performance evaluation, is emphasized as a valuable method to evaluate and compare possible configurations of these systems.",

In this paper, we focus our review mainly on the recent trends in specific applications of flame aerosol synthesis in the last decade, e.g., (a) usage of a substrate in stagnation geometry with controlled particle temperature\u2013time history, (b) application of external fields to control particle characteristics, (c) development of advanced spray technique for doping synthesis of nanocomposites of multicomponent metal oxides or carbon\u2013metal oxides, and (d) fabrication of nanomaterial-based functional devices.

     "abstract": "This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in catalytic processes to convert methane (a major component of natural gas) to more valuable hydrocarbons as fuels or chemicals. The scope is restricted to \u201cdirect\u201d conversion, meaning that processes involving synthesis gas as an intermediate are not considered. Oxygenated products (e.g., alcohols) are also not considered. In all cases, the processes are concerned with catalytic dehydrogenation. The two most widely studied processes are oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and methane dehydroaromatization (MDA). After reviewing the relevant catalysis literature, the paper goes on to review reactor implementations. Hydrogen- and/or oxygen-permeable membranes can potentially play valuable roles in improving methane conversion and product yields. Despite over 30 years of research, there are still no direct-conversion processes that can compete commercially with methane reforming followed by processes such as Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis. Thus, the future practical development and deployment of OCM and MDA will rely on the research and development of advanced catalysts and innovative processes. The present review helps to document the foundation on which the needed development can build.",

     "publication date": "07-2016",
     "abstract": "Mono-functional catalytic materials are used for many types of chemical transformations, but are tedious for delivering products from multiple-step reactions required for the valorization of biomass. An emerging trend is to integrate catalytic transformations, reaction engineering and product separation into a single operation, wherein catalyst design is considered as the key approach to develop efficient, low energy and environmentally-friendly reaction systems. Bifunctional solid catalysts open a door for carrying out domino/cascade- and tandem/sequential-type reactions in a single pot, for which the number of isolation or purification steps can be lessened or eliminated so that removal of unwanted by-products becomes unnecessary. This review introduces bifunctional materials used in one-pot multiple transformations of biomass into biofuels and related chemicals. Emphasis is placed on the assessment of the bifunctionality of catalytic materials, including Bronsted\u2013Lewis acid, acid\u2013base, and metal particles\u2013acid or base bifunctional catalysts with some discussion being on combined catalytic systems with electrochemical, chemo-enzymatic and photochemical methods. Plausible reaction mechanisms for key pathways are shown. Relevant auxiliaries to boost catalytic activity and product selectivity, such as reaction media, heating modes and morphological properties of the catalytic materials are analyzed. Use of appropriate bifunctional catalytic materials provides many opportunities for design of highly efficient reaction systems and simplified processing for producing biofuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass.",

     "abstract": "Natural gas is an important energy resource for electric power generation and other energy needs. Recent discoveries of vast reserves of shale gas greatly increased its abundance while lowering its cost. Combined with its significantly smaller carbon-footprint than coal, natural gas has increasingly become the preferred choice to generate electrical power even at the expense of converting existing coal fired power plants to run on natural gas. However, most natural gas combustion-based power plants currently operate at efficiencies in the low 30%. Conversion of natural gas in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) promises to increase system level conversion efficiencies to above 60%, doubling the current efficiencies and significantly reducing the CO2 emissions by a factor of 2. Such dramatic improvements in conversion efficiency and ease of CO2 capture are currently out of reach for the combustion-based power generation technologies. Equally importantly, the CO2 produced from methane conversion leaves the fuel cell in a highly concentrated form. As nitrogen is blocked off by the impervious ceramic electrolyte of the SOFC from entering the process stream, methane oxidation produces a flue stream that is primarily made of the oxidation products CO2 and steam. The latter can easily be condensed out to capture CO2, thus eliminating the need for expensive and energy intensive post separation operations otherwise required to separate CO2 from N2 for storage purposes. So if successfully developed and deployed widely, natural gas conversion in SOFCs will greatly reduce CO2 emissions, help mitigate climate change, and minimize the environmental impact of power generation.This article organizes and critically reviews the current state of understanding in methane catalysis and oxidation with particular emphasis for electrochemical conversion in SOFCs. It presents a comprehensive review of a vast volume of published work (>600 references) extending from fundamental studies in CH bond activation and methane catalysis to basic concepts of electrochemical conversion in fuel cells, to strategies for effective utilization of methane in SOFCs, and associated technical difficulties such as deactivation due to sulfur and carbon yet to be overcome for realizing natural gas conversion, to impactful opportunities provided by recent theoretical advances in computational catalysis and materials screening studies, and innovative concepts such as strain effects and nanostructuring toward enhancing catalytic rates. It provides tutorial-type information at the appropriate level for the uninitiated but interested reader as well as critical discussions of fundamental phenomena and assessment of recent advances for active researchers in the field. The article is weighted around materials and surface properties and provides an in-depth review with emphasis on electronic structure, charge transport and catalysis. It presents an impartial evaluation of the opportunities as well as the challenges to natural gas utilization in SOFCs. Finally, it concludes that natural gas conversion in SOFCs promises very attractive opportunities for efficient and environmentally friendly power generation, while recognizing and offering in-depth discussions of the challenges facing this technology before it can be considered for large-scale power generation applications.",

     "abstract": "Increased energy demand worldwide has caused faster depletion of sweet feedstock and increased exploitation of sourer hydrocarbon fuels. These fuels often contain acid gases (H2S and CO2), mercaptans and trace amounts of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) that are harmful to human health, the environment and industrial equipment. The US EPA has proposed a reduction of sulfur in gasoline from 30\u2009ppm to 10\u2009ppm by 2017. To reach this goal, crude oil and gas must be subjected to more efficient desulfurization processes in which acid gases are major byproducts. The separated acid gases and associated impurities are further processed for material and energy recovery, as the fuels with high sulfur content are restricted due to their harmful effects. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the treatment of acid gases and associated impurities is given along with an advanced Claus process design that can capture much greater amounts of sulfur in the thermal stage to decrease the burden in catalytic stages and reduce operational costs. Claus process technology, although mature and commonly used for the recovery of sulfur and energy from acid gases, has low thermal stage efficiency that further deteriorates with change in acid gas composition. The non-uniformity of acid gas feed streams poses several technical and operational problems, resulting in higher operational costs and increased toxic gas emissions. Sulfur chemistry provides a path for improved understanding of the complex process in the thermal stage of the Claus reactor with a goal to recover both energy and improve the quality of sulfur produced, so that catalytic stages are minimal. The sulfur chemistry and kinetic models of H2S combustion are reviewed. Practical problems emanating from the presence of acid gas impurities (such as CO2, ammonia, light hydrocarbons, aromatics, COS and CS2) during the acid gas conversion process are evaluated. Reactor conditions that mitigate the impact of impurities are also included. An urgent need exists for the development of comprehensive kinetic models that can capture the combustion chemistry of H2S along with the presence of trace quantities of aromatics, ammonia and other impurities during sulfur recovery in Claus reactors. Our current knowledge lacks a detailed chemistry, so that effective capture of acid gas conversion in the Claus thermal stage remains a challenge. Future studies must focus on a systematic coupling of the available kinetic models for neat H2S, hydrocarbon and ammonia fuels, and subsequent validation under partially oxidizing operating conditions in Claus reactors. Such a mechanism could help to improve the efficiency of sulfur recovery processes and sulfur quality for improved design of advanced Claus reactors with enhanced sulfur capture, energy recovery and mitigated environmental issues.",

     "abstract": "Thermal energy storage (TES) transfers heat to storage media during the charging period, and releases it at a later stage during the discharging step. It can be usefully applied in solar plants, or in industrial processes, such as metallurgical transformations. Sensible, latent and thermo-chemical media store heat in materials which change temperature, phase or chemical composition, respectively. Sensible heat storage is well-documented. Latent heat storage, using phase change materials (PCMs), mainly using liquid\u2013solid transition to store latent heat, allows a more compact, efficient and therefore economical system to operate. Thermo-chemical heat storage (TCS) is still at an early stage of laboratory and pilot research despite its attractive application for long term energy storage.The present review will assess previous research, while also adding novel treatments of the subject. TES systems are of growing importance within the energy awareness: TES can reduce the LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) of renewable energy processes, with the temperature of the storage medium being the most important parameter. Sensible heat storage is well-documented in literature and applied at large scale, hence limited in the content of the present review paper. Latent heat storage using PCMs is dealt with, specifically towards high temperature applications, where inorganic substances offer a high potential. Finally, the use of energy storage through reversible chemical reactions (thermo-chemical storage, TCS) is assessed. Since PCM and TCS storage media need to be contained in a capsule (sphere, tube, sandwich plates) of appropriate materials, potential containment materials are examined. A heat transfer fluid (HTF) is required to convey the heat from capture, to storage and ultimate re-use. Particle suspensions offer a valid alternative to common HTF, and a preliminary assessment confirms the advantages of the upflow bubbling fluidized bed and demonstrates that particulate suspensions enable major savings in investment and operating costs.Novel treatments of the TES subject in the review involve the required encapsulation of the latent and chemical storage media, the novel development of powder circulation loops as heat transfer media, the conductivity enhancement of PCMs, the use of lithium salts, among others.",

     "abstract": "Biomass is available from many sources or can be mass-produced. Moreover, biomass has a high energy-generation potential, produces less toxic emissions than some other fuels, is mostly carbon neutrality, and burns easily. Biomass has been widely utilized as a raw material in thermal chemical conversion, replacing coal and oil, including power generation. Biomass firing and co-firing in pulverized coal boilers, fluidized bed boilers, and grate furnaces or stokerfed boilers have been developed around the world because of the worsening environmental problems and developing energy crisis. However, many issues hinder the efficient and clean utilization of biomass in energy applications. They include preparation, firing and co-firing, and ash-related issues during and after combustion. In particular, ash-related issues, including alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), agglomeration, corrosion, and ash utilization, are among the most challenging problems. The current review provides a summary of knowledge and research developments concerning these ash-related issues. It also gives an in-depth analysis and discussion on the formation mechanisms, urgent requirements, and potential countermeasures including the use of additives, co-firing, leaching, and alloying.Alkali species, particularly alkali chlorides and sulfates, cause alkali-induced slagging during biomass combustion. Thus, the mechanisms of generation, transformation, and sequestration of alkali species and the formation and growth of alkali-induced slagging, formed as an alternating overlapping multi-layered structure, are discussed in detail. For silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), the evolutions of chemical composition of both the elements and minerals in the ash during combustion and existing problems in testing are overviewed. Pseudo-4D phase diagrams of (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3 are proposed as effective tools to predict ash fusion characteristics and the properties of melt-induced slagging. Concerning agglomeration that typically occurs in fluidized bed furnaces, melt-induced and coating-induced agglomeration and coating-forming mechanisms are highlighted. Concerning corrosion, seven corrosion mechanisms associated with Cl2, gaseous, solid/deposited, and molten alkali chlorides, molten alkali sulfates and carbonates, and the sulfation/silication of alkali chlorides are comprehensively reviewed. The effects of alloying, salt state (solid, molten, or gaseous), combustion atmosphere, and temperature are also discussed systematically. For ash utilization, potential approaches to the use of fly ash, bottom ash, and biomass/coal co-fired ash as construction and agricultural materials are explored.Several criteria or evaluation indexes are introduced for alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration, and chemical equilibrium calculation and multicomponent phase diagrams of silicate melt-induced slagging and agglomeration. Meanwhile, remedies, including the use of additives, co-firing, leaching, alloying, and the establishment of regulations, are discussed.It is suggested that considerable attention should be focused on an understanding of the kinetics of alkali chemistry, which is essential for the transformation and sequestration of alkali species. A combination of heterogeneous chemical kinetics and multiphase equilibrium modeling is critical to estimating the speciation, saturation levels, and the presence of melt of the ash-forming matter. Further practical evaluation and improvement of the existing criterion numbers of alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration should be improved. The pseudo-4D phase diagrams of (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3 should be constructed from the data derived from real biomass ashes rather than those of simulated ashes in order to provide the capability to predict the properties of silicate melt-induced slagging. Apart from Cr, research should be conducted to understand the effects of Si, Al, and Co, which exhibit high corrosion resistance, and heavy metals such as Zn and Pb, which may form low-melting chlorides that accelerate corrosion. Regulations, cooperation among biomass-fired power plants and other industries, potential technical research, and logistics should be strengthened to enable the extensive utilization of biomass ash. Finally, alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging, agglomeration, and corrosion occur concurrently, and thus, these issues should be investigated jointly rather than separately.",

     "abstract": "Over the past few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the development of particle-based discrete simulation methods versus the conventional continuum-based methods. In particular, the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has evolved from a theoretical novelty to a ubiquitous, versatile and powerful computational methodology for both fundamental research and engineering applications. It is a kinetic-based mesoscopic approach that bridges the microscales and macroscales, which offers distinctive advantages in simulation fidelity and computational efficiency. Applications of the LB method are now found in a wide range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials, biomedicine and various branches of engineering. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the LB method for thermofluids and energy applications, focusing on multiphase flows, thermal flows and thermal multiphase flows with phase change. The review first covers the theoretical framework of the LB method, revealing certain inconsistencies and defects as well as common features of multiphase and thermal LB models. Recent developments in improving the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consistency, reducing spurious currents, enhancing the numerical stability, etc., are highlighted. These efforts have put the LB method on a firmer theoretical foundation with enhanced LB models that can achieve larger liquid-gas density ratio, higher Reynolds number and flexible surface tension. Examples of applications are provided in fuel cells and batteries, droplet collision, boiling heat transfer and evaporation, and energy storage. Finally, further developments and future prospect of the LB method are outlined for thermofluids and energy applications.",

     "abstract": "The understanding of soot formation in combustion processes and the optimization of practical combustion systems require in situ measurement techniques that can provide important characteristics, such as particle concentrations and sizes, under a variety of conditions. Of equal importance are techniques suitable for characterizing soot particles produced from incomplete combustion and emitted into the environment. Additionally, the production of engineered nanoparticles, such as carbon blacks, may benefit from techniques that allow for online monitoring of these processes.In this paper, we review the fundamentals and applications of laser-induced incandescence (LII) for particulate diagnostics in a variety of fields. The review takes into account two variants of LII, one that is based on pulsed-laser excitation and has been mainly used in combustion diagnostics and emissions measurements, and an alternate approach that relies on continuous-wave lasers and has become increasingly popular for measuring black carbon in environmental applications. We also review the state of the art in the determination of physical parameters central to the processes that contribute to the non-equilibrium nanoscale heat and mass balances of laser-heated particles; these parameters are important for LII-signal analysis and simulation. Awareness of the significance of particle aggregation and coatings has increased recently, and the effects of these characteristics on the LII technique are discussed.Because of the range of experimental constraints in the variety of applications for which laser-induced incandescence is suited, many implementation approaches have been developed. This review discusses considerations for selection of laser and detection characteristics to address application-specific needs. The benefits of using LII for measurements of a range of nanoparticles in the fields mentioned above are demonstrated with some typical examples, covering simple flames, internal-combustion engines, exhaust emissions, the ambient atmosphere, and nanoparticle production. We also remark on less well-known studies employing LII for particles suspended in liquids.An important aspect of the paper is to critically assess the improvement in the understanding of the fundamental physical mechanisms at the nanoscale and the determination of underlying parameters; we also identify further research needs in these contexts. Building on this enhanced capability in describing the underlying complex processes, LII has become a workhorse of particulate measurement in a variety of fields, and its utility continues to be expanding. When coupled with complementary methods, such as light scattering, probe-sampling, molecular-beam techniques, and other nanoparticle instrumentation, new directions for research and applications with LII continue to materialize.",

Extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing mathematical models for understanding SS-AD mechanisms, predicting its performance, and improving process control. In this review, SS-AD mathematical models derived from theoretical, empirical, and statistical approaches are critically reviewed and discussed regarding their different assumptions, structures, applications, and limitations. Based on this review, it was concluded that significant efforts should be devoted to experimental verification of the model assumptions, measurement of important kinetic parameters specific for SS-AD, and generation of sufficient data for model validation.

To that effect, the presentation of the main aspects of the reference Langevin model as well as the detailed analysis of several applications covering a range of practical concerns reveal the actual possibilities of these modeling approaches. A third objective is to report on recent developments that open possibilities for Lagrangian stochastic methods, including for example first steps toward structure-based models, hybrid numerical formulations as well as new accounts of particle\u2013particle interactions.

     "abstract": "Controlling fuel injector deposits is recognized as a challenge for advanced direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engines. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the research on formation, measurement, effect, and mitigation of injector deposits in DISI engines. Methodologies for the injector deposit studies include visual and compositional analysis. It is shown that injector deposits will reduce injector fuel flow rates, and lead to changes in spray characteristics. Consequently, spray angle and envelope are likely to be affected, and spray penetration distance as well as droplet diameter can be increased. Injector deposits are revealed to be primarily fuel-derived and created by two distinct free radical pathways, i.e., low temperature auto-oxidation and high temperature pyrolysis. Fuel compositions (olefins, aromatics, and sulphur), as well as T90 parameter, are significant factors in injector deposit formation. The worst consequences of injector fouling are pre-ignition, and engine misfiring and malfunction. Emissions, especially particulates, dramatically increase as the fuel injector becomes fouled. It appears that fuel detergent is the most effective method in controlling injector deposit formation if its chemistry and dosage rate are optimized. Outward opening piezo-driven injector configuration with a good surface finish, a sharp nozzle inlet, and a counter bore design, is useful in preventing injector deposit formation. Reducing injector nozzle temperature by methods such as designing special injector cooling passages, and improving engine design are also proven to be helpful in reducing injector fouling. Anti-deposit coatings only delay the onset of injector deposit formation.",

     "abstract": "A class of non-detonating materials capable of highly exothermic reactions, referred to as reactive materials (RMs), has been subjected to extensive recent studies. Examples include pure reactive metals, intermetallic, metal-metalloid composites, and thermites; the latter two types of materials include nano-composite and nanostructured compositions. Most of the studied RMs are based on aluminum. Potential applications for RMs include additives to conventional energetics (propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics) and reactive structural components. Design of energetic systems including RM's requires reliable prediction of their ignition kinetics, including ignition delays as a function of involved heating rates, pressures, and oxidizing environments. Direct measurements of such ignition delays are often impossible because of hostile surroundings RMs are exposed to. Research has been active in quantifying ignition temperatures and kinetics using simplified configurations and low heating rates, relatively easily achieved in laboratory conditions. Alternatively, multiple ignition studies focused on a specific stimuli, e.g., electric current, spark, heat pulse, etc. However, correlation between laboratory studies and ignition observed in practical situation is tentative at best. Substantial discrepancies exist between different experiments and, respectively, proposed ignition models. More recently, thermo-analytical (TA) measurements performed isothermally or at well-controlled heating rates and in well-characterized environments were used to identify and describe quantitatively reactions leading to ignition. In this review, TA measurements aimed to develop models for ignition of pure aluminum, aluminum-based reactive intermetallics, and thermites are considered using specific examples for each type of material. The focus is on relatively recent studies. Results and interpretations of the TA measurements are discussed in terms of their relevance to describing ignition for each specific type of material. The examples included are selected because substantial progress in characterization of their ignition mechanisms was made recently using TA measurements. Individual exothermic steps were identified and assigned to particular reactions or phase transformations in each specific material system. Kinetics of some of the identified steps were reported and applicability of such kinetics is discussed for modeling ignition, involving much higher heating rates than thermo-analytical measurements. Different ignition stimuli are considered, and ignition models involving detailed analysis of heat transfer affected by identified chemical reactions are discussed briefly. Both benefits and limitations of applying the TA based reaction mechanisms for ignition models are considered. Some common caveats in interpreting TA measurements for reactive materials are also reviewed. Despite substantial progress, there are no comprehensive and universally accepted ignition models for the materials systems. A common theme observed here for all reactive materials is that ignition is caused by more than one reaction and/or phase change. Many, but not all such reactions and phase changes can be characterized based on thermo-analytical measurements.",

     "abstract": "Thermoacoustic oscillations associated with transverse acoustic modes are routinely encountered in combustion chambers. While a large literature on this topic exists for rockets, no systematic reviews of transverse oscillations are available for air-breathing systems, such as in boilers, aircraft engines, jet engine augmentors, or power generating gas turbines. This paper reviews work on the problem for air-breathing systems, summarizing experimental, modeling, and active control studies of transverse oscillations. It then details the key physical processes controlling these oscillations by describing transverse acoustic wave motions, the effect of transverse acoustic waves on hydrodynamic instabilities, and the influence of acoustic and hydrodynamic fluid motions on the unsteady heat release. This paper particularly emphasizes the distinctions between the direct and indirect effect of transverse wave motions, by arguing that the dominant effect of the transverse acoustics is to act as the \u201cclock\u201d that controls the frequency and modal structure of the disturbance field. However, in many instances, it is the indirect axial flow disturbances at the nozzles (driven by pressure oscillations from the transverse mode), and the vortices that they excite, that cause the dominant heat release rate oscillations. Throughout the review, we discuss issues associated with simulating or scaling instabilities, either in subscale experimental geometries or by attempting to understand instability physics using identical nozzle hardware during axial oscillations of the same frequency as the transverse mode of interest. This review closes with a model problem that integrates many of these controlling elements, as well as recommendations for future research needs.",

However, to develop a clean and renewable energy system, significant developments must be made, not only in energy conversion technologies (such as solar panels and wind turbines) but also regarding the feasibility and capabilities of stationary electrical energy storage (EES) systems. Many types of EES systems have been considered such as pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS), compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheels, and electrochemical storage. Among them, electrochemical storage such as battery has the advantage of being more efficient compared to other candidates, because it is more suitable in terms of the scalability, efficiency, lifetime, discharge time, and weight and/or mobility of the system. Currently, rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are the most successful portable electricity storage devices, but their use is limited to small electronic equipment. Using LIBs to store large amounts of electrical energy in stationary applications is limited, not only by performance but also by cost. Thus, a viable battery technology that can store large amounts of electrical energy in stationary applications is needed.

     "abstract": "The current interest in the combustion chemistry of hydrocarbon fuels, including the various alcohol and biodiesel compounds, motivates this review of the methods and application of kinetic uncertainty quantification (UQ). Our intent is to provide a self-contained review about the mathematical principles and methods of uncertainty quantification and their application in highly complex, multi-parameter combustion chemistry problems. We begin by outlining the reasons why the kinetic uncertainty must be considered and treated as a part of the combustion chemistry development in order to make progress. This is followed by a brief discussion about the sources and classification of kinetic uncertainties and the meanings and definitions of model verification and validation. We discuss the histories of UQ studies with an emphasis on how the combustion community has a long tradition of UQ consideration through standard sensitivity analysis. Such efforts have motivated the advancements of UQ methods specifically tailored to combustion chemistry. They also led to the recent growing interests in applying UQ methods as a part of our recommended long-term solution to the chemical kinetic problem of combustion. We then review and classify the various UQ methods and illustrate their applications for problems involving forward uncertainty quantification and propagation, and as an inverse problem leading to model uncertainty constraining. For the inverse problem, the focus of discussion is in the use of methods originating from Bayes' Theorem. We show that, for combustion chemistry problems, while UQ alone cannot produce precise, individual rate parameters, it can be instrumental in measuring the progress of our understanding of combustion chemistry and in utilizing fundamental combustion property data beyond a simple \u201cagree\u2013disagree\u201d statement. When treated as a Bayesian inference problem, UQ also aids the development of predictive kinetic models in two ways: the use of fundamental combustion property data, global or local, to provide a better constrained kinetic model, and along with forward kinetic uncertainty propagation, to yield estimates for the confidence of a model to make predictions outside of the thermodynamic regimes where the model has been tested. We provide several examples to illustrate the utility of the UQ methods discussed and to demonstrate that, in the field of combustion chemistry, further progress will be better achieved through a combination of fundamental studies of reaction rates through well-defined and designed experiments and ab initio theoretical calculations, and of analyses of global experimental measurements. These studies together must be supplemented by UQ analyses, in such a way that a measurable progress can be made over time.",

It can be produced from different kinds of renewable feedstock such as e.g. sugar cane, corn, wheat, cassava (first generation), cellulose biomass (second generation) and algal biomass (third generation). The conversion pathways for the production of bio-ethanol from disaccharides, from starches, and from lignocellulosic biomass are examined. The common processing routes are described, with their mass and energy balances, and assessed by comparing field data and simulations. Improvements through 5 possible interventions are discussed, being (i) an integrated energy-pinch of condensers and reboilers in the bio-ethanol distillation train; (ii) the use of Very High Gravity (VHG) fermentation; (iii) the current development of hybrid processes using pervaporation membranes; (iv) the substitution of current ethanol dewatering processes to >99.5\u00a0wt% pure ethanol by membrane technology; and (v) additional developments to improve the plant operation such as the use of microfiltration of the fermenter broth to protect heat exchangers and distillation columns against fouling, or novel distillation concepts.Whereas the benefits of introducing these techniques are recognized, extensive research is still needed to scientifically and economically justify their application. The paper finally presents a tentative economic assessment, with production costs not only depending on the extent of applying process improvements, but also on the raw material used in the process.",

     "abstract": "Globally, low rank coals are responsible for about half of the world's total coal deposits. However, these low rank coals present a high moisture content, which significantly impacts their utilization processes, including lower power plant efficiency, increased transportation costs, higher CO2 emission, and spontaneous combustion during storage. In order to decrease the energy consumption of low rank coal during the utilization processes, drying and dewatering technologies must be well designed. This review presents recent development in drying and dewatering technologies for low rank coals. Evaporative drying technologies, such as rotary-drying, fluidized-bed drying, hot oil immersion drying, hot oil-immersion drying, as well as non-evaporative drying technologies such as hydrothermal dewatering, mechanical/thermal dewatering, solvent extraction, are summarized in detail. Future research to upgrade low rank-coals, which are deposited in arid geological environments, is also suggested.",

     "abstract": "This article covers key and representative developments in the area of high efficiency and clean internal combustion engines. The main objective is to highlight recent efforts to improve (IC) engine fuel efficiency and combustion. Rising fuel prices and stringent emission mandates have demanded cleaner combustion and increased fuel efficiency from the IC engine. This need for increased efficiency has placed compression ignition (CI) engines in the forefront compared to spark ignition (SI) engines. However, the relatively high emission of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emitted by diesel engines increases their cost and raises environmental barriers that have prevented their widespread use in certain markets. The desire to increase IC engine fuel efficiency while simultaneously meeting emissions mandates has thus motivated considerable research. This paper describes recent progress to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel or CI engines through advanced combustion and fuels research. In particular, a dual fuel engine combustion technology called \u201creactivity controlled compression ignition\u201d (RCCI), which is a variant of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), is highlighted, since it provides more efficient control over the combustion process and has the capability to lower fuel use and pollutant emissions. This paper reviews recent RCCI experiments and computational studies performed on light- and heavy-duty engines, and compares results using conventional and alternative fuels (natural gas, ethanol, and biodiesel) with conventional diesel, advanced diesel and HCCI concepts.",

The recently developed UNIQUE gasifier which integrates gasification, gas cleaning and conditioning in one reactor unit is an example for a promising process integration. Other interesting concepts combine pyrolysis and gasification or gasification and combustion in single controlled stages.

     "abstract": "This article deals with the resuspension phenomenon whereby particles adhering on a wall surface can be re-entrained by a flowing fluid. This is an area where significant progress has been achieved over the last years from an experimental, theoretical and numerical point of view. A first purpose of the present work is to report on the advances that have clarified our understanding of the physics of particle resuspension. It will be seen that new pictures have emerged about the physical processes involved in particle resuspension and, correspondingly, that new models have been proposed. A second purpose of the review is to put forward a general framework that allows both experimental analysis and new modelling ideas to be developed in terms of the fundamental interactions at play. These interactions are made up by the particle\u2013fluid, particle\u2013surface and particle\u2013particle forces which are, in turn, related to the three specific fields of fluid dynamics, interface chemistry and surface roughness. Such a separation is helpful to highlight the actual physical processes while emphasising their relative importance in different situations and to provide useful guidelines for the necessary modelling efforts. In particular, it is stressed that new models which capture particle motion along a wall and simulate the complete particle dynamics represent an improvement over more classical static approaches. It is proposed that these new approaches be pursued and brought to higher levels of maturity.In this paper, attention is first focussed on the case where only a single layer of particles is sticking on the surface and, thus, can be re-entrained. A detailed review of the experimental works brings out the essential mechanisms and particle resuspension is shown to result from a balance between particle\u2013fluid interactions and particle\u2013surface interactions influenced by surface heterogeneities (roughness). The numerical models which have been proposed are then thoroughly discussed with respect to a new hierarchy of modelling approaches which is introduced. The present paper also outlines the mechanisms of multilayer particle resuspension which is still an open subject and where our present understanding remains preliminary. In this situation, resuspension is shown to be also governed by particle\u2013fluid and particle\u2013surface interactions but with the addition of particle\u2013particle interactions (through cohesion forces or impaction). Finally, suggestions about the areas that still need to be addressed as well as about the issues that remain to be improved are addressed.",

     "abstract": "Current world energy usage is trying to gradually shift away from fossil fuels due to the concerns for the climate change and environmental pollutions. Liquid energy from renewable biomass is widely regarded as one of the greener alternatives to partially fulfil the ever-growing energy demand. Contemporary research and technology has been focussing on transforming these bio-resources into efficient liquid and gaseous fuels which are compatible with existing petrochemical energy infrastructure. Due to the wide range of properties and compositions from different types of biomass, there are ample of processing routes available to cater for different demands and requirements. In addition, they can produce multi-component products which can be further upgraded into higher value products. This conceives the idea of bio-refinery where different biomass conversion processes are incorporated and proceed simultaneously at one location. However, the underlying complexity in integrating different processes with varying process conditions will undoubtly incurs prohibitive cost. Consequently, process intensification plays an important role in minimizing both the capital and operating costs associated with process integration in bio-refineries. Recently, process intensification for biodiesel production has been developing rigorously due to increasing demand for cost-cutting measures. Supercritical fluid process allows biodiesel production to be performed without any addition of catalyst. Meanwhile, catalytic in situ or reactive extraction process for biodiesel production successfully combines the extraction and reaction phase together in a single processing unit. In this review, the important characteristics and recent progress on both of the intensification processes for biodiesel production will be critically analyzed. The prospects and recent advances of supercritical reactive extraction (SRE) process which integrates both of the processes will also be discussed. This review will also scrutinize on the methods for these processes to compliment future bio-refinery setup and more efficient utilizing of all of the products generated.",

     "abstract": "Spray ignition represents a critical process in numerous propulsion and energy conversion devices. Compared to a gaseous mixture, ignition in a spray is significantly more complex, as the state of ignition in the latter case can be defined by three distinct ignition modes namely, droplet ignition, droplet cluster ignition, and spray ignition. Ignition for an individual droplet represents the appearance of a flame surrounding the droplet or in the wake region, with a dimension on the order of droplet diameter. The cluster or group ignition refers to the ignition around or inside a droplet cloud, while the spray ignition implies the appearance of a global flame with a characteristic dimension few orders of magnitude larger than a droplet. In all three modes, ignition is preceded by the evaporation of fuel droplets, formation of a combustible gaseous fuel\u2013air mixture, and initiation of chemical reactions producing sufficient radical species. The identification of the dominant ignition mode for given two-phase properties represents a problem of significant fundamental and practical importance. Research dealing with laminar and turbulent spray ignition has been reviewed by Aggarwal [1] and Mastorakos [2], respectively, while Annamalai and Ryan [3] have provided a review of droplet group combustion/ignition. In the present review, we discuss experimental, theoretical, and computational research dealing with individual droplet ignition. Topics include the quasi-steady and unsteady models for the ignition of a fuel droplet in a stagnant environment, the droplet ignition in a high-pressure environment, the convective effects on droplet ignition, and multicomponent fuel droplet ignition. Studies dealing with the two-stage and NTC ignition behavior for a droplet are also discussed. Finally, relationship between the droplet ignition mode to droplet cluster and spray ignition modes is briefly described. Potential topics for further research are outlined.",

     "abstract": "Rapid compression machines (RCMs) are used to simulate a single compression stroke of an internal combustion engine without some of the complicated swirl bowl geometry, cycle-to-cycle variation, residual gas, and other complications associated with engine operating conditions. RCMs are primarily used to measure ignition delay times as a function of temperature, pressure, and fuel/oxygen/diluent ratio; further they can be equipped with diagnostics to determine the temperature and flow fields inside the reaction chamber and to measure the concentrations of reactant, intermediate, and product species produced during combustion.This paper first discusses the operational principles and design features of RCMs, including the use of creviced pistons, which is an important feature in order to suppress the boundary layer, preventing it from becoming entrained into the reaction chamber via a roll-up vortex. The paper then discusses methods by which experiments performed in RCMs are interpreted and simulated. Furthermore, differences in measured ignition delays from RCMs and shock tube facilities are discussed, with the apparent initial gross disagreement being explained by facility effects in both types of experiments. Finally, future directions for using RCMs in chemical kinetics studies are also discussed.",

     "abstract": "The present discourse is directed toward the community that wishes to generate or use flow reactor data from complex chemical reactions as kinetic model development and validation targets. Various methods for comparing experimental data and computational predictions are in evidence in the literature, along with limited insights into uncertainties associated with each approach. Plug flow is most often assumed in such works as a simple, chemically insightful physical reactor model; however, only brief qualitative justifications for such an interpretation are typically offered. Modern tools permit the researcher to quantitatively confirm the validity of this assumption. In a single complex reaction system, chemical time scales can change dramatically with extent of reaction of the original reactants and with transitions across boundaries separating low temperature, intermediate temperature, and chain branched (high temperature) kinetic regimes. Such transitions can violate the underlying assumptions for plug flow interpretation. Further, uncertainties in reaction initialization may confound interpretation of experiments for which the plug flow assumption may be appropriate. Finally, various methods of acquiring experimental data can also significantly influence experimental interpretations. The following discussions provide important background for those interested in critically approaching the relatively vast literature on the application of flow reactors for generating kinetic validation data. The less frequently discussed influences of reactor simulation assumptions on modeling predictions are addressed through examples for which the kinetic behavior of specific reactant combinations may cause experimental observations to depart locally from plug flow behavior.",

     "abstract": "Alternative transportation fuels, preferably from renewable sources, include alcohols with up to five or even more carbon atoms. They are considered promising because they can be derived from biological matter via established and new processes. In addition, many of their physical-chemical properties are compatible with the requirements of modern engines, which make them attractive either as replacements for fossil fuels or as fuel additives. Indeed, alcohol fuels have been used since the early years of automobile production, particularly in Brazil, where ethanol has a long history of use as an automobile fuel. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the use of non-petroleum-based fuels made from biological sources, including alcohols (predominantly ethanol), as important liquid biofuels. Today, the ethanol fuel that is offered in the market is mainly made from sugar cane or corn. Its production as a first-generation biofuel, especially in North America, has been associated with publicly discussed drawbacks, such as reduction in the food supply, need for fertilization, extensive water usage, and other ecological concerns. More environmentally friendly processes are being considered to produce alcohols from inedible plants or plant parts on wasteland. While biofuel production and its use (especially ethanol and biodiesel) in internal combustion engines have been the focus of several recent reviews, a dedicated overview and summary of research on alcohol combustion chemistry is still lacking. Besides ethanol, many linear and branched members of the alcohol family, from methanol to hexanols, have been studied, with a particular emphasis on butanols. These fuels and their combustion properties, including their ignition, flame propagation, and extinction characteristics, their pyrolysis and oxidation reactions, and their potential to produce pollutant emissions have been intensively investigated in dedicated experiments on the laboratory and the engine scale, also emphasizing advanced engine concepts. Research results addressing combustion reaction mechanisms have been reported based on results from pyrolysis and oxidation reactors, shock tubes, rapid compression machines, and research engines. This work is complemented by the development of detailed combustion models with the support of chemical kinetics and quantum chemistry. This paper seeks to provide an introduction to and overview of recent results on alcohol combustion by highlighting pertinent aspects of this rich and rapidly increasing body of information. As such, this paper provides an initial source of references and guidance regarding the present status of combustion experiments on alcohols and models of alcohol combustion.",

The improved ability to accurately constrain the test conditions in shock tube experiments, combined with non-intrusive, species-sensitive and quantitative laser absorption diagnostics, is enabling experimenters to provide a new generation of high-quality experimental kinetics targets for combustion chemistry model validation and refinement.

In parallel, the sustainability of the new biofuel industries also requires to maintain a high level of biodiversity while playing on techno-diversity, using a variety of resources that do not compete with edible crops (nor by using arable land for energy crops or food crops for energy production) and flexible conversion technologies satisfying the eco-design, eco-energy and eco-materials criteria. In addition, it would be relevant to consider blending ethyl biodiesel, instead of methyl biodiesel, with petrodiesel, particularly if the fuel formulation is completed with bioethanol (or even water). The supercritical ethanolysis of lipid resources to produce ethyl biodiesel is a simple but efficient route that should have the potential to satisfy the sustainability criteria if analyzed holistically. Therefore, this review focuses specifically on the production of ethyl biodiesel via triglyceride supercritical ethanolysis within a global analysis \u201cfeedstocks-conversion-engine\u201d. The scientific and technical bottlenecks requiring further development are highlighted by emphasizing (i) the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects (experiments and modeling) required for the process simulation, the results of which aim at securing the life cycle assessment, first at the process level and then at the fuel level; (ii) the proposals to improve the supercritical process performance in terms of eco-material and eco-energy; (iii) the impacts of ethyl vs. methyl biodiesel fuels and of biodiesel\u2013ethanol\u2013petrodiesel blends (with or without water) on the diesel engine emissions and performance; (iv) the technological flexibility of the supercritical process allowing its conversion toward production of other key products. Finally, built on the state-of-the art review, a new R&D direction combining supercritical ethanolysis of lipids with the addition of CO2, glycerol recovery, and cogeneration, according to the biorefinery concept, is proposed and discussed.",

Laminar flames constitute an essential part of kinetic model development as the rates of elementary reactions are studied and/or validated in the presence of temperature and species concentration gradients. The various methods considered in this review are the flat, low-pressure, burner-stabilized premixed flame for chemical speciation studies, and the stagnation, spherically expanding, and burner-stabilized flames for determining the global flame properties. The data derived using these methods are considered at present as the most reliable ones for three decades of pressures ranging from about 50\u00a0mbar to over 50\u00a0bar. Furthermore, the attendant initial and/or boundary conditions and physics are in principle well characterized, allowing for the isolation of various physical parameters that could affect the flame structure and thus the reported data. The merits of each approach and the advances that have been made are outlined and the uncertainties of the reported data are discussed.

     "publication date": "06-2014",
     "abstract": "Tubular flames are ideal for the study of stretch and curvature effects on flame structure, extinction, and instabilities. Tubular flames have uniform stretch and curvature and each parameter can be varied independently. Curvature strengthens or weakens preferential diffusion effects on the tubular flame and the strengthening or weakening is proportional to the ratio of the flame thickness to the flame radius. Premixed flames can be studied in the standard tubular burner where a single premixed gas stream flows radially inward to the cylindrical flame surface and products exit as opposed jets. Premixed, diffusion and partially premixed flames can be studied in the opposed tubular flame where opposed radial flows meet at a cylindrical stagnation surface and products exit as opposed jets. The tubular flame flow configurations can be mathematically reduced to a two-point boundary value solution along the single radial coordinate. Non-intrusive measurements of temperature and major species concentrations have been made with laser-induced Raman scattering in an optically accessible tubular burner for both premixed and diffusion flames. The laser measurements of the flame structure are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the tubular flame. Due to the strong enhancement of preferential diffusion effects in tubular flames, the theory-data comparison can be very sensitive to the molecular transport model and the chemical kinetic mechanism. The strengthening or weakening of the tubular flame with curvature can increase or decrease the extinction strain rate of tubular flames. For lean H2-air mixtures, the tubular flame can have an extinction strain rate many times higher than the corresponding opposed jet flame. More complex cellular tubular flames with highly curved flame cells surrounded by local extinction can be formed under both premixed and non-premixed conditions. In the hydrogen fueled premixed tubular flames, thermal-diffusive flame instabilities result in the formation of a uniform symmetric petal flames far from extinction. In opposed-flow tubular diffusion flames, thermal-diffusive flame instabilities result in cellular flames very close to extinction. Both of these flames are candidates for further study of flame curvature and extinction.",

Out of all bioconversion technologies for biofuel and bioenergy production, anaerobic digestion (AD) is a most cost-effective bioconversion technology that has been implemented worldwide for commercial production of electricity, heat, and compressed natural gas (CNG) from organic materials. However, the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass for biogas production via anaerobic digestion has not been widely adopted because the complicated structure of the plant cell wall makes it resistant to microbial attack. Pretreatment of recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass is essential to achieve high biogas yield in the AD process. A number of different pretreatment techniques involving physical, chemical, and biological approaches have been investigated over the past few decades, but there is no report that systematically compares the performance of these pretreatment methods for application on lignocellulosic biomass for biogas production. This paper reviews the methods that have been studied for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for conversion to biogas.

In this review, recent progress and methods for combining and integrating sonication into biomass pretreatment and conversion for fuels and chemicals are critically assessed. Ultrasonic energy combined with proper solvents allows destruction of the recalcitrant lignocellulosic structure, fractionation of biomass components, and then assists many thermochemical and biochemical reactions, with increased equilibrium yields of sugars, bio-ethanol and gas products by 10\u2013300%. Sonication promotes hydrolysis, esterification and transesterification in biodiesel synthesis and leads to reduced reaction time by 50\u201380%, lower reaction temperature, less amounts of solvent and catalyst than comparable unsonicated reaction systems. For algal biomass, sonication benefits the disruption, lysis and content release of macro\u00a0and microalgae cells, and reduces the time required for subsequent extraction and chemical/biochemical reactions, with efficiencies typically being improved by 120\u2013200%. High-frequency ultrasound of 1\u20133\u00a0MHz allows harvesting of microalgae, liquid product separation and in-situ process monitoring of biomass reactions, while high-intensity ultrasound at 20\u201350\u00a0kHz activates heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysis of the biomass reactions. The use of ultrasound in conversion of biomass to biofuels provides a positive process benefit.",

Data and methods available currently limit the use of resource estimates for energy or production planning. We develop function based multipliers to estimate the global production of agricultural residues. The multipliers are applied to the production of the, on a global scale, six most important crops: barley, maize, rice, soybean, sugar cane and wheat in 227 countries and territories of the world. We find a global production of residues from these six crops of 3.7 \u2212 1.0 + 1.3 Pg dry matter yr\u22121. North and South America, Eastern, South-Eastern and Southern Asia and Eastern Europe each produce more than 200\u00a0Tg\u00a0yr\u22121.

     "abstract": "CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has received significant attention recently and is recognized as an important option for reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. A particularly promising option involves the use of dry alkali metal-based sorbents to capture CO2 from flue gas. Here, alkali metal carbonates are used to capture CO2 in the presence of H2O to form either sodium or potassium bicarbonate at temperatures below 100\u00a0\u00b0C. A moderate temperature swing of 120\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C then causes the bicarbonate to decompose and release a mixture of CO2/H2O that can be converted into a \u201csequestration-ready\u201d CO2 stream by condensing the steam. This process can be readily used for retrofitting existing facilities and easily integrated with new power generation facilities. It is ideally suited for coal-fired power plants incorporating wet flue gas desulfurization, due to the associated cooling and saturation of the flue gas. It is expected to be both cost effective and energy efficient.This paper provides the first comprehensive review of the major research progress on this technology. To date such research has focused on two main areas: sorbent development and process development. In the case of sorbent development, pure sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate were tested directly. More recent research has concentrated on using supported sorbents which provide the necessary attrition resistance for use with fluidized-bed or transport reactors. Research on sorbent development has included an examination of the physical properties, carbonation and regeneration reaction behavior, reaction kinetic behavior, and multi-cycle behavior of these alkali metal-based sorbents. By contrast, process development activities have focused on solving the many unique challenges associated with post-combustion CO2 capture using alkali metal-based sorbents. The research on process development included exploration of the effects of operation conditions such as reaction temperature, gas composition, operation pressure, and gas impurities on CO2 capture behavior, continuous operation of the CO2 capture process, and economic evaluation of this process. Finally, this paper discusses the research challenges and opportunities that exist with this technology.",

     "abstract": "The higher penetration of renewable resources in the energy portfolios of several communities accentuates the need for accurate forecasting of variable resources (solar, wind, tidal) at several different temporal scales in order to achieve power grid balance. Solar generation technologies have experienced strong energy market growth in the past few years, with corresponding increase in local grid penetration rates. As is the case with wind, the solar resource at the ground level is highly variable mostly due to cloud cover variability, atmospheric aerosol levels, and indirectly and to a lesser extent, participating gases in the atmosphere. The inherent variability of solar generation at higher grid penetration levels poses problems associated with the cost of reserves, dispatchable and ancillary generation, and grid reliability in general. As a result, high accuracy forecast systems are required for multiple time horizons that are associated with regulation, dispatching, scheduling and unit commitment. Here we review the theory behind these forecasting methodologies, and a number of successful applications of solar forecasting methods for both the solar resource and the power output of solar plants at the utility scale level.",

     "abstract": "Interest in the production of biodiesel\u2014a clean renewable fuel\u2014is increasing worldwide. Industrial-scale processes currently being developed use homogenous and heterogeneous chemical catalysis processes that are highly efficient but require very pure reagents and complex product purification steps, or high temperature and pressure processing conditions. Enzymatic catalysis using plant lipases as biocatalysts is an alternative which, contrary to chemical catalysis processes, is simple to perform, at low investment cost, and therefore potentially easier to disseminate, especially in developing countries. Although microbial lipases have been extensively studied, little research has been focused on the use of plant lipases in biodiesel production. These latter lipases can, however, be readily extracted from the plant organs that contain them (seeds, bran or latex) and they are less expensive to use than microbial lipases. The aim of the present article was thus to review published research findings and outline the most advanced knowledge concerning alkyl ester production catalyzed by plant lipases. This work focuses mainly on the conditions for using plant lipases in certain synthesis reactions (biomass selection, preparation and purification of lipase extracts) and current knowledge on reaction parameters that affect the catalytic activity. Moreover, biodiesel production using plant lipases and ethanol instead of methanol certainly seems to be in line with the development of innovative environment-friendly technologies.",

     "abstract": "Low temperature combustion (LTC) engines are an emerging engine technology that offers an alternative to spark-ignited and diesel engines. One type of LTC engine, the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine, uses a well-mixed fuel\u2013air charge like spark-ignited engines and relies on compression ignition like diesel engines. Similar to diesel engines, the use of high compression ratios and removal of the throttling valve in HCCI allow for high efficiency operation, thereby allowing lower CO2 emissions per unit of work delivered by the engine. The use of a highly diluted well-mixed fuel\u2013air charge allows for low emissions of nitrogen oxides, soot and particulate matters, and the use of oxidation catalysts can allow low emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. As a result, HCCI offers the ability to achieve high efficiencies comparable with diesel while also allowing clean emissions while using relatively inexpensive aftertreatment technologies.HCCI is not, however, without its challenges. Traditionally, two important problems prohibiting market penetration of HCCI are 1) inability to achieve high load, and 2) difficulty in controlling combustion timing. Recent research has significantly mitigated these challenges, and thus HCCI has a promising future for automotive and power generation applications.This article begins by providing a comprehensive review of the physical phenomena governing HCCI operation, with particular emphasis on high load conditions. Emissions characteristics are then discussed, with suggestions on how to inexpensively enable low emissions of all regulated emissions. The operating limits that govern the high load conditions are discussed in detail, and finally a review of recent research which expands the high load limits of HCCI is discussed. Although this article focuses on the fundamental phenomena governing HCCI operation, it is also useful for understanding the fundamental phenomena in reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), partial fuel stratification (PFS), partially premixed compression ignition, spark-assisted HCCI, and all forms of low temperature combustion (LTC).",

The aim of this review is to provide an insight into the basic knowledge and the current state of the art of research on sorption thermal storage technologies. The first section is concerned with the terminology and classification for sorption processes to give a clear scope of discussion in this paper. Sorption thermal storage is suggested to cover four technologies: liquid absorption, solid adsorption, chemical reaction and composite materials. Then the storage mechanisms and descriptions of basic closed and open cycles are given. The progress of sorption materials, cycles, and systems are also reviewed. Besides the well-known sorbents like silica gels and zeolites, some new materials, including aluminophosphates (AlPOs), silico-aluminophosphates (SAPOs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are proposed for heat storage. As energy density is a key criterion, emphais is given to the comparison of storage densities and charging tempertures for different materials. Ongoing research and development studies show that the challenges of the technology focus on the aspects of different types of sorption materials, the configurations of absorption cycles and advanced adsorption reactors. Booming progress illustrates that sorption thermal storage is a realistic and sustainable option for storing solar energy, especially for long-term applications. To bring the sorption storage solution into market, more intensive studies in fields of evaluation of advanced materials and development of efficient and compact prototypes are still required.",

     "abstract": "This review article aims to provide a comprehensive and understandable account of the theoretical foundation, modeling issues, and numerical implementation of the Lagrangian\u2013Eulerian (LE) approach for multiphase flows. The LE approach is based on a statistical description of the dispersed phase in terms of a stochastic point process that is coupled with a Eulerian statistical representation of the carrier fluid phase. A modeled transport equation for the particle distribution function \u2014 also known as Williams' spray equation in the case of sprays \u2014 is indirectly solved using a Lagrangian particle method. Interphase transfer of mass, momentum and energy are represented by coupling terms that appear in the Eulerian conservation equations for the fluid phase. This theoretical foundation is then used to develop LE sub-models for interphase interactions such as momentum transfer. Every LE model implies a corresponding closure in the Eulerian\u2013Eulerian two-fluid theory, and these moment equations are derived. Approaches to incorporate multiscale interactions between particles (or spray droplets) and turbulent eddies in the carrier gas that result in better predictions of particle (or droplet) dispersion are described. Numerical convergence of LE implementations is shown to be crucial to the success of the LE modeling approach. It is shown how numerical convergence and accuracy of an LE implementation can be established using grid-free estimators and computational particle number density control algorithms. This review of recent advances establishes that LE methods can be used to solve multiphase flow problems of practical interest, provided sub-models are implemented using numerically convergent algorithms. These insights also provide the foundation for further development of Lagrangian methods for multiphase flows. Extensions to the LE method that can account for neighbor particle interactions and preferential concentration of particles in turbulence are outlined.",

To provide a reference to which the LTC conceptual models may be compared, an established conceptual model framework for conventional diesel combustion is first reviewed and updated. Then, based on multiple optical diagnostic observations and homogeneous reactor simulations using detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms, extensions to the existing conceptual model are proposed. The LTC conceptual models are not intended to describe all LTC strategies, but rather a common subset of low-load, single-injection, partially premixed compression ignition conditions that are diluted by exhaust-gas recirculation to oxygen concentrations in the range of 10\u201315%. The models describe the spray formation, vaporization, mixing, ignition, and pollutant formation and destruction mechanisms that are consistent with experimental observations and modeling predictions for LTC diesel engines. Two separate subcategories are offered for either heavy-duty, large-bore or for light-duty, small-bore engines. Relative to the existing conventional diesel conceptual model, the features of the LTC conceptual models include longer liquid-fuel penetration, an extended ignition delay that allows more premixing of fuel, a more distinct and temporally extended two-stage ignition, more spatially uniform second-stage ignition, reduced and altered soot formation regions, and increased overmixing leading to incomplete combustion.",

     "abstract": "A critical review of the state of the art of research on internal forced convection boiling in microchannels and in microgravity conditions is the main object of the present paper.In many industrial applications, two-phase flows are used for heavy-duty and reliable cooling and heating processes. The boiling phenomena are essential for evaporator heat exchangers, even in a very small scales, such as for PC cooling, refrigerators, HVAC systems. Even if the study of boiling is a standard research since a century, there are many aspects which are still under discussion, especially for forced convection boiling in small tubes. As the present review is pointing out, some literature results are still incongruous, giving critical uncertainties to the design engineers. The use of non-dimensional parameters is rather useful, but, especially in case of boiling, may provide an erroneous picture of the phenomena in quantitative and qualitative meaning. The idea to consider the channel microsize together with the microgravity effects in a single review is due to the fact that the transition between confined and unconfined bubble flows may be defined using dimensionless numbers, such as the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s number Eo\u00a0=\u00a0g(\u03c1L\u2212\u03c1V)L2/\u03c3 and its analogs, which are at the same time linked to the tube diameter and the gravity forces. In fact the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s number tends to zero either when the gravity tends to zero or when the tube diameter tends to zero, but physical phenomena appear different considering separately either only the tube size or only the microgravity condition. Since the global picture of such physical process in flow boiling remains unclear, we claim the necessity to define in the most complete way the status-of-the-art of such an important research field and critically investigate the successes and the weaknesses of the current scientific literature. Noteworthy, the distinction between a macroscale and a microscale regime is misleading, since it could bring to consider a drastical variation of the physical phenomena, which is in fact not occurring until extremely low values of the channel dimension. Instead there is a typical flow pattern, the confined bubble flow, which is the dominant flow mechanism in small channels and in microgravity. Furthermore the vapor quality is a very important parameter, whose role is not well described in the present pattern classification. The values and combinations of the dimensionless numbers at which such pattern appears is the main issue of the present researches. Noteworthy, the meaning of \u201cmicro\u201d is here used, as in the present literature, in a broad meaning, not strictly linked to the actual size of the channel, but to a change of patterns (and other physical characteristics) linked to a given dimensionless scale.",

During the past decade, significant progress has been made toward understanding the mechanisms of plasma\u2013chemistry interactions, energy redistribution and the nonequilibrium initiation of combustion. In addition, a wide variety of fuels have been examined using various types of discharge plasmas. Plasma application has been shown to provide additional combustion control, which is necessary for ultra-lean flames, high-speed flows, cold low-pressure conditions of high-altitude gas turbine engine (GTE) relight, detonation initiation in pulsed detonation engines (PDE) and distributed ignition control in homogeneous charge-compression ignition (HCCI) engines, among others. The present paper describes the current understanding of the nonequilibrium excitation of combustible mixtures by electrical discharges and plasma-assisted ignition and combustion.",

     "abstract": "Multi-phase transport of reactant and product species, momentum, heat (energy), electron and proton in the components of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells forms the three inter-related circuits for mass, heat (energy) and electricity. These intertwined transport phenomena govern the operation and design, hence the performance, of such cells. The transport processes in the cell are usually determined with their respective effective transport properties due to the porous nature of PEM fuel cell components. These properties include the effective diffusion coefficient for the mass transfer, effective thermal conductivity for heat transfer, effective electronic conductivity for electron transfer, effective protonic conductivity for proton transfer, intrinsic and relative permeability for fluid flow, capillary pressure for liquid water transfer, etc. Accurate determination of these effective transport properties is essential for the operation and design of PEM fuel cells, especially at high current density operation. Thus, it is the focus of intensive research in the recent years. In this article, a review is provided for the determination of these effective transport properties through the various PEM fuel cell components, including the gas diffusion layer, microporous layer, catalyst layer and the electrolyte membrane layer. Given the simplicity of the GDL in structure compared to the other components of the cell, much more work in literature is focused on its transport properties. Hence, its review in this paper is more extensive. Various methods used for the determination of the effective transport properties with and without the presence of liquid water are reviewed, including experimental measurements, numerical modeling and theoretical analyses. Correlations are summarized for these transport properties, where available and further work in this area is provided as a direction for future work.",

In this review article, the spray, atomization, combustion and exhaust emissions characteristics from a DME-fueled engine are described, as well as the fundamental fuel properties including the vapor pressure, kinematic viscosity, cetane number, and the bulk modulus. DME fuel exists as gas phase at atmospheric state and it must be pressurized to supply the liquid DME to fuel injection system. In addition, DME-fueled engine needs the modification of fuel supply and injection system because the low viscosity of DME caused the leakage. Different fuel properties such as low density, viscosity and higher vapor pressure compared to diesel fuel induced the shorter spray tip penetration, wider cone angle, and smaller droplet size than diesel fuel. The ignition of DME fuel in combustion chamber starts in advance compared to diesel or biodiesel fueled compression ignition engine due to higher cetane number than diesel and biodiesel fuels. In addition, DME combustion is soot-free since it has no carbon\u2013carbon bonds, and has lower HC and CO emissions than that of diesel combustion. The NOx emission from DME-fueled combustion can be reduced by the application of EGR (exhaust gas recirculation). This article also describes various technologies to reduce NOx emission from DME-fueled engines, such as the multiple injection strategy and premixed combustion. Finally, the development trends of DME-fueled vehicle are described with various experimental results and discussion for fuel properties, spray atomization characteristics, combustion performance, and exhaust emissions characteristics of DME fuel.",

Coal dust was used in the past and mostly in slurries because of large production during industrial era in Europe but led to many problems caused by fuel handling and wear in ICE. In comparison, biomass has a CO2 neutral impact, and is almost ash and sulphur free. Biomass pulverization technologies are now mature and the raw material can be reduced to micronic size or even smaller. Among the various new and renewable fuels under research and development, solid raw biomass is certainly the most promising advanced biofuel. It requires no or little thermochemical or biological processing or upgrading and potentially does not generate waste, detrimental to the environment.

     "abstract": "Underground coal gasification (UCG) is a promising option for the future use of un-worked coal. UCG permits coal to be gasified in situ within the coal seam, via a matrix of wells. The coal is ignited and air is injected underground to sustain a fire, which is essentially used to \u201cmine\u201d the coal and produce a combustible synthetic gas which can be used for industrial heating, power generation or the manufacture of hydrogen, synthetic natural gas or diesel fuel. As compared with conventional mining and surface gasification, UCG promises lower capital/operating costs and also has other advantages, such as no human labor underground. In addition, UCG has the potential to be linked with carbon capture and sequestration. The increasing demand for energy, depletion of oil, and gas resources, and threat of global climate change have lead to growing interest in UCG throughout the world. The potential for UCG to access low grade, inaccessible coal resources and convert them commercially and competitively into syngas is enormous, with potential applications in power, fuel, and chemical production. This article reviews the literature on UCG and research contributions are reported UCG with main emphasis given to the chemical and physical characteristic of feedstock, process chemistry, gasifier designs, and operating conditions. This is done to provide a general background and allow the reader to understand the influence of operating variables on UCG. Thermodynamic studies of UCG with emphasis on gasifier operation optimization based on thermodynamics, biomass gasification reaction engineering and particularly recently developed kinetic models, advantages and the technical challenges for UCG, and finally, the future prospects for UCG technology are also reviewed.",

In this highly swarming context towards process intensification, this article provides an overview of the different strategies which are reported in the literature to perform syngas or H2 purification and conditioning into the gasifier. A promising avenue towards process intensification consists in integrating several functionalities into suitable fluidized bed gasifiers, such as catalytic tar cracking/reforming, CO2 elimination, H2 separation and the elimination of particles and other contaminants. The development of new catalytic integrated gasification concepts is also proposed to achieve high conversion performances while pursuing significant process intensification. This strategy is illustrated by relevant examples such as the design of short contact time partial oxidation catalytic reactors, the implementation of specific reaction media such as supercritical water or molten metal, or the realisation of a close contact between solid catalysts and lignocellulosic biomass. Most of these different technologies are not mature yet and research effort has to be performed for optimizing each of these approaches, calling for a multidisciplinary and multi-scale approach integrating catalysis, chemistry, reaction and process engineering. The design of new advanced gasification reactor concept still has to be pursued in order to achieve the challenging one-step production of a high quality syngas from biomass gasification. The implementation of such innovative biomass gasification breakthrough concepts could be one of the most promising ways of process intensification resulting in a significant cut down of the production costs of synthesis gas and H2 derived from biomass.",

In this paper, two types of LES in complex geometry combustors and of specific interest for aeronautical gas turbine burners are reviewed: (1) laboratory-scale combustors, without compressor or turbine, in which advanced measurements are possible and (2) combustion chambers of existing engines operated in realistic operating conditions. Laboratory-scale burners are designed to assess modeling and fundamental flow aspects in controlled configurations. They are necessary to gauge LES strategies and identify potential limitations. In specific circumstances, they even offer near model-free or DNS-like LES computations. LES in real engines illustrate the potential of the approach in the context of industrial burners but are more difficult to validate due to the limited set of available measurements. Usual approaches for turbulence and combustion sub-grid models including chemistry modeling are first recalled. Limiting cases and range of validity of the models are specifically recalled before a discussion on the numerical breakthrough which have allowed LES to be applied to these complex cases. Specific issues linked to real gas turbine chambers are discussed: multi-perforation, complex acoustic impedances at inlet and outlet, annular chambers\u2026. Examples are provided for mean flow predictions (velocity, temperature and species) as well as unsteady mechanisms (quenching, ignition, combustion instabilities).

     "abstract": "The details of the chemical and physical mechanisms of the soot formation process in combustion remain uncertain due to the highly complex nature of hydrocarbon flames, and only a few principles are firmly established mostly for atmospheric conditions. In spite of the fact that most combustion devices used for transportation operate at very high pressures (e.g., aircraft gas turbines up to 40\u00a0atm, diesel engines exceeding 100\u00a0atm), our understanding of soot formation at these pressures is not at a desirable level, and there is a fundamental lack of experimental data and complementary predictive models. The focus of this review is to assess the experimental results available from laminar co-flow diffusion flames burning at elevated pressures. First, a brief review of soot formation mechanisms in diffusion flames is presented. This is followed by an assessment of soot diagnostics techniques, both intrusive and non-intrusive, most commonly used in soot experiments including the laser induced incandescence. Then the experimental results of soot measurements done at elevated pressures in diffusion flames are reviewed and critically assessed. Soot studies in shock tubes and in premixed flames are not covered. Smoke point fuel mass flow rate is revisited, and shortcomings in recent measurements are pointed. The basic requirements for tractable and comparable measurements as a function of pressure are summarized. Most recent studies at high pressures with aliphatic gaseous fuels show that the soot yield displays a unified behaviour with reduced pressure. The maximum soot yield seems to reach a plateau asymptotically as the pressure exceeds the critical pressure of the fuel. Lack of experimental data on the sensitivity of soot morphology to pressure is emphasized. A short summary of efforts in the literature on the numerical simulation of soot formation in diffusion flames at high pressures is the last section of the paper.",

     "abstract": "In a real turbulent spray flame, dispersion, continuous phase turbulence modification, dispersed phase inter-particle collisions, evaporation, mixing and combustion occur simultaneously. Dealing with all these complexities and their interactions poses a tremendous modeling task. Therefore, in order to advance current modeling capabilities, it seems reasonable to aim for progress in individual sub-areas like breakup, dispersion, mixing and combustion, which however cannot be viewed in complete isolation. Further, one has to consider advantages and disadvantages of the general modeling approaches, which are direct numerical simulation (DNS), large eddy simulation (LES), simulations based on Reynolds averaged equations and probability density function (PDF) methods. Not least one also has to distinguish between Eulerian and Lagrangian dispersed phase descriptions. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of computational model developments relevant for turbulent dilute spray combustion, i.e. the dense regime, including collisions as well as primary and secondary atomization, is not covered. Also not considered is breakup in dilute sprays, which can occur in the presence of sufficiently high local turbulence. It is intended to guide readers interested in theory, in the development and validation of predictive models, and in planning new experiments. In terms of physical phenomena, the current understanding regarding turbulence modification due to droplets, preferential droplet concentration, impact on evaporation and micro-mixing, and different spray combustion regimes is summarized. In terms of modeling, different sets of equations are discussed, i.e. the governing conservation laws without and with point droplet approximation as employed by DNS, the filtered equations considered in LES, the Reynolds averaged equations, and Lagrangian evolution equations. Further, small scale models required in the context of point droplet approximations are covered. In terms of computational studies and method developments, progress is categorized by the employed approaches, i.e. DNS, LES, simulations based on Reynolds averaged equations, and PDF methods. In terms of experiments, various canonical spray flame configurations are discussed. Moreover, some of the most important experiments in this field are presented in a structured way with the intention to provide a database for model validation and a guideline for future investigations.",

     "abstract": "Mercury is a pollutant of concern and mercury emissions from cement plants are under environmental regulation. After coal-fired power plants, mercury emissions from cement and mineral production are the second largest anthropogenic sources. Compared to fuels, cement raw materials are the major sources of mercury in the cement kiln flue gas. Cement plants are quite different from power plants and waste incinerators regarding the flue gas composition, temperature, residence time, and material circulation. Cement kiln systems have some inherent ability to retain mercury in the solid materials due to the adsorption of mercury on the solids in the cold zone. However, recirculation of the kiln dust to the kiln will cause release of the captured mercury. The mercury chemistry in cement kiln systems is complicated and knowledge obtained from power plants and incinerators cannot be directly applied in cement kilns.Among the mercury control technologies, sorbent injection upstream of a particulate control device has shown the most promise. Due to material recirculation, and high moisture level in the cement kiln flue gas the application of sorbent injection to cement plants will be more challenging. The sorbent injection system should be installed downstream of the main kiln filter and upstream of a new added polishing fabric filter to avoid the cement kiln dust recycling and disposal issues. To reduce the sorbent cost and possible disposal expense, non-carbon based sorbents that could be added to cement or regenerated in-situ are desired and should be developed.Various mathematical models have been developed to simulate mercury removal in fixed-bed reactors and by sorbent injection upstream of a fabric filter. The fabric filter adsorption models use the adsorption isotherms coupled with diffusion in the sorbent particle and the parameters are obtained by fitting the model to experimental data. Verification of the models by full-scale or pilot-scale data is very limited.",

     "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is widely seen as a critical technology for reducing atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants and other large industrial facilities, which are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions linked to global climate change. However, the high cost and energy requirements of current CO2 capture processes are major barriers to their use. This paper assesses the outlook for improved, lower-cost technologies for each of the three major approaches to CO2 capture, namely, post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-combustion capture. The advantages and limitations of each of method are discussed, along with the current status of projects and processes at various stages in the development cycle. We then review a variety of \u201croadmaps\u201d developed by governmental and private-sector organizations to project the commercial roll-out and deployment of advanced capture technologies. For perspective, we also review recent experience with R&D programs to develop lower-cost technologies for SO2 and NOx capture at coal-fired power plants. For perspective on projected cost reductions for CO2 capture we further review past experience in cost trends for SO2 and NOx capture systems. The key insight for improved carbon capture technology is that achieving significant cost reductions will require not only a vigorous and sustained level of research and development (R&D), but also a substantial level of commercial deployment, which, in turn, requires a significant market for CO2 capture technologies. At present such a market does not yet exist. While various incentive programs can accelerate the development and deployment of improved CO2 capture systems, government actions that significantly limit CO2 emissions to the atmosphere ultimately are needed to realize substantial and sustained reductions in the future cost of CO2 capture.",

     "abstract": "Solid acid catalysts, which have favorable characteristics such as efficient activity, high selectivity, long catalyst life and ease in recovery and reuse, have great potential for efficiently transforming lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels and can replace many conventional liquid acids for hydrolysis and pretreatment. This work briefly introduces conventional biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis techniques, and reviews in detail the characteristics of biomass hydrolysis for five types of solid acid catalysts grouped as H-form zeolites, transition-metal oxides, cation-exchange resins, supported solid acids and heteropoly compounds. Carbonaceous solid acid (CSA) catalysts are considered as the most promising catalyst for cellulose hydrolysis, since they provide good access of reactants to the acidic sites of SO3H groups. High glucose yields of up to 75% with 80% selectivity have been achieved at 150\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h with CSA. However, separation of CSA from un-hydrolyzed cellulose residues after hydrolysis needs further research since these catalysts have similar physical and chemical properties to the residues. Use of functionalized CSA catalysts that contain paramagnetic groups is one method to improve CSA separation and reuse. Suggestions are given for promoting catalytic efficiency for each kind of solid acid catalysts. Methods to promote reactions or increase selectivities such as microwave, ultrasonication and nanotechnology are introduced. Finally, we highlight a recent strategy that exploits acid-functionalized paramagnetic nanoparticles suitable for cellulose hydrolysis, and address new opportunities for the use of solid acid catalysts.",

     "abstract": "The transient operation of turbocharged diesel engines can prove quite demanding in terms of engine response, systems reliability and exhaust emissions. It is a daily encountered situation that drastically differentiates the engine operation from the respective steady-state conditions, requiring careful and detailed study and experimentation. On the other hand, depleting reserves and growing prices of crude oil, as well as gradually stricter emission regulations and greenhouse gas concerns have led to an ever-increasing effort to develop alternative fuel sources, with particular emphasis on biofuels that possess the added benefit of being renewable. In this regard, and particularly for the transport sector, biodiesel has emerged as a very promising solution.The target of the present work is to review the literature regarding the effects of diesel-biodiesel blends on the regulated exhaust emissions of diesel engines operating under transient conditions (acceleration, load increase, starting and transient cycles). The analysis focuses on all regulated pollutants, i.e. particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons; results are also presented for combustion noise and particle size concentration/distribution. The most important mechanisms of exhaust emissions during transients are analyzed based on the fundamental aspects of transient operation and on the impacts the physical and chemical properties of biodiesel have relative to conventional diesel oil. Biodiesel feedstock, transient cycle and fuel injection system effects are also discussed.For the majority of the reviewed transients, a decreasing trend in PM, HC and CO, and an increasing trend in NOx emissions is established when the biodiesel ratio in the fuel blend increases. Irrespective of driving cycle type, the NOx emission penalty and the PM benefit with biodiesel seem to increase for more aggressive cycles/driving patterns. Moreover, biodiesels produced from unsaturated feedstocks tend to increase the NOx emission liability, at least for older production engines; no such correlation has been established for the emitted PM, HC or CO. Since the research so far stems from engines optimized for diesel fuel, application of a revised engine calibration (e.g. EGR, injection system) can prove very useful in eliminating, at least in part, any inefficiencies caused by the use of biodiesel.Based on a large amount of published data over the last twenty years, best-fit correlations are deducted for quantification of biodiesel benefits or penalties on all regulated pollutants during various transient/driving cycles. Also, a detailed list is provided summarizing data from all published works on the subject during the last two decades.",

The willingness of the U.S. government to face the issues of more heavily high-priced foreign oil and climate change has led to more investment on plant-derived sustainable biofuel sources. Biomass derived from corn has become one of the primary feedstocks for bioethanol production for the past several years in the U.S. However, the argument of whether to use food as biofuel has led to a search for alternative non-food sources. Consequently, industrial research efforts have become more focused on low-cost large-scale processes for lignocellulosic feedstocks originating mainly from agricultural and forest residues along with herbaceous materials and municipal wastes. Although cellulosic-derived biofuel is a promising technology, there are some obstacles that interfere with bioconversion processes reaching optimal performance associated with minimal capital investment. This review summarizes current approaches on lignocellulosic-derived biofuel bioconversion and provides an overview on the major steps involved in cellulosic-based bioethanol processes and potential issues challenging these operations. Possible solutions and recoveries that could improve bioprocessing are also addressed. This includes the development of genetically engineered strains and emerging pretreatment technologies that might be more efficient and economically feasible.

The \u201ccore\u201d of these technologies is a prime mover based on different technologies (Stirling, Reciprocating Internal Combustion, Fuel Cell, Gas Turbine, \u2026), specially designed to operate in stationary conditions for a long time. This operation is accompanied by high efficiency output and very low pollutant emissions with regards to the reference separate \u201cproduction\u201d by large thermal power stations.At the moment, the most common technology, the gas-fired Reciprocating Internal Combustion (RIC) engine, has very good features e.g. in terms of installation space, thermal efficiency, low noise and vibration and maintenance. These engines can drive electric generators and/or electric heat pumps, absorption heat pumps and so on in different ways (mechanically, electrically and thermally), thereby allowing a wide range of operating conditions to match thermal (heating and cooling) and electric end-user requirements.The aim of this paper is to study the Energy, Economic and Environmental implications (3-E analysis) of using these complex small scale trigeneration energy conversion systems, starting with the results of an intensive theoretical and experimental research activity. In particular these systems, in comparison with conventional system, based on separate energy production, can guarantee a primary energy saving up to 28% and a reduction of equivalent CO2 emissions up to 36% when the trigeneration system is based on a small scale cogeneration system (Micro Combined Heat and Power, MCHP) coupled to a Heat Pump (HP). Satisfactory results can be achieved considering a cogeneration system which interacts with an Electric Heat Pump (EHP). On the contrary, small scale trigeneration systems based on Thermally activated Heat Pump (THP) show low efficiency, with respect to conventional systems. This is due to the low COP of small scale cooling devices which is the reason why these systems require further improvements to be able to compete with traditional one.",

     "abstract": "Bioconversion of renewable lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel and value added products are globally gaining significant prominence. Market forces demonstrate a drive towards products benign to natural environment increasing the importance of renewable materials. The development of second generation bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass serves many advantages from both energy and environmental point of views. Biomass an inexpensive feedstock considered sustainable and renewable, is an option with the potential to replace a wide diversity of fossil based products within the energy sector; heat, power, fuels, materials and chemicals. Lignocellulose is a major structural component of woody and non-woody plants and consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The effective utilization of all the three components would play a significant role in the economic viability of cellulosic ethanol. Biomass conversion process involves five major steps, choice of suitable biomass, effective pretreatment, production of saccharolytic enzymes-cellulases and hemicellulases, fermentation of hexoses and pentoses and downstream processing. Within the context of production of fuels from biomass, pretreatment has come to denote processes by which cellulosic biomass is made amenable to the action of hydrolytic enzymes. The limited effectiveness of current enzymatic process on lignocellulose is thought to be due to the relative difficulties in pretreating the feedstocks. The present review is a comprehensive state of the art describing the advancement in recent pretreaments, metabolic engineering approaches with special emphasis on the latest developments in consolidated biomass processing, current global scenario of bioethanol pilot plants and biorefinery concept for the production of biofuels and bioproducts.",

     "abstract": "The paper starts by reviewing the increasing production of waste and the growing importance of its thermal treatment, which aims at volume reduction of the waste, at the destruction, capture, and concentration of hazardous substances, and at the recovery of energy (WtE).Incineration is a generally applied thermal treatment technique, whereas pyrolysis and gasification are still under development. Within the incineration techniques, bubbling, rotating and circulating fluidized beds have found specific and growing applications. As technical information on fluidized bed waste incinerators is spread throughout literature, the present review paper collates the relevant literature and critically examines the parameters that govern the design and operation of these incinerators.Secondly, the design strategy of a fluidised bed incinerator is outlined, which involves considerations of hydrodynamic (velocities, mixing), thermal (heat balances) and kinetic (reaction rate and burnout) nature. Application of the design equations and recommendations will facilitate the sizing of an appropriate fluidized bed incinerator.Since during waste incineration pollutants are formed, the origin and fate of the pollutants and their abatement are reviewed.Finally, special attention is given to the specific de-fluidization problems often encountered during fluidized bed combustor operation, mainly because of agglomeration and sintering. The mechanisms of agglomeration and sintering are discussed, and possible remedies are given. Additionally, important issues of equipment erosion and uniform feeding of the waste into the fluidized bed reactor are considered.",

     "abstract": "There is a lack of comprehensive information in the retrievable literature on pilot scale process and energy data using promising process technologies and commercially scalable and available capital equipment for lignocellulosic biomass biorefining. This study conducted a comprehensive review of the energy efficiency of selected sugar platform biorefinery process concepts for biofuel production from lignocelluloses. The process data from approximately a dozen studies that represent state-of-the-art in cellulosic biofuel production concepts, along with literature energy input data for agriculture operations, were analyzed to provide estimates of net energy production. It was found that proper allocation of energy input for fertilizer and pesticides to lignocellulosic biomass and major agriculture or forestry products, such as corn and lumber in corn farming and lumber plantations, respectively, were critical. The significant discrepancies in literature data suggest studies are needed to determine energy inputs for fuel in farming and farm machinery. Increasing solids loading in pretreatment to at least 25% is critical to reducing energy input in a biorefinery. Post thermo-chemical pretreatment size reduction approach should be adopted for energy efficient woody biomass processing. When appropriate pretreatment technologies are used, woody biomass can be processed as efficiently as herbaceous biomass and agricultural residues. Net energy output for cellulosic ethanol was estimated to range approximately from \u2212500\u20132000 MJ/ton biomass (HHV base); indicating that the energy input/output ratio is approximately 1:1 for cellulosic ethanol. However, net energy can reach approximately 4000\u20137000 MJ/ton of biomass when energy from lignin is included.",

     "abstract": "Fuel cells are under development for a range of applications for transport, stationary and portable power appliances. Fuel cell technology has advanced to the stage where commercial field trials for both transport and stationary applications are in progress. The electric efficiency typically varies between 40 and 60% for gaseous or liquid fuels. About 30\u201340% of the energy of the fuel is available as heat, the quality of which varies based on the operating temperature of the fuel cell. The utilisation of this heat component to further boost system efficiency is dictated by the application and end-use requirements. Fuel cells utilise either a gaseous or liquid fuel with most using hydrogen or synthetic gas produced by a variety of different means (reforming of natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas, reforming of liquid fuels such as diesel and kerosene, coal or biomass gasification, or hydrogen produced via water splitting/electrolysis). Direct Carbon Fuel Cells (DCFC) utilise solid carbon as the fuel and have historically attracted less investment than other types of gas or liquid fed fuel cells. However, volatility in gas and oil commodity prices and the increasing concern about the environmental impact of burning heavy fossil fuels for power generation has led to DCFCs gaining more attention within the global research community. A DCFC converts the chemical energy in solid carbon directly into electricity through its direct electrochemical oxidation. The fuel utilisation can be almost 100% as the fuel feed and product gases are distinct phases and thus can be easily separated. This is not the case with other fuel cell types for which the fuel utilisation within the cell is typically limited to below 85%. The theoretical efficiency is also high, around 100%. The combination of these two factors, lead to the projected electric efficiency of DCFC approaching 80% - approximately twice the efficiency of current generation coal fired power plants, thus leading to a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of CO2 for storage/sequestration is also halved. Moreover, the exit gas is an almost pure CO2 stream, requiring little or no gas separation before compression for sequestration. Therefore, the energy and cost penalties to capture the CO2 will also be significantly less than for other technologies. Furthermore, a variety of abundant fuels such as coal, coke, tar, biomass and organic waste can be used. Despite these advantages, the technology is at an early stage of development requiring solutions to many complex challenges related to materials degradation, fuel delivery, reaction kinetics, stack fabrication and system design, before it can be considered for commercialisation. This paper, following a brief introduction to other fuel cells, reviews in detail the current status of the direct carbon fuel cell technology, recent progress, technical challenges and discusses the future of the technology.",

     "abstract": "The manufacturing, distribution and wide use of synthetic pesticides engender new hazards to people and the environment. In addition to mammalian and unintended toxicity of some pesticides, ecosystems face the risk of toxic products released from the unintentional combustion of pesticides; e.g., accidental chemical fires or burning of pesticide-treated biomass. This review summarises and analyses the pertinent literature of the techniques employed to determine toxic products released in thermal decomposition of pesticides, including contributions on large scale experiments from international collaborations sponsored in early 1990s by the European Commission and on small-scale bench top investigations undertaken by a number of independent research groups around the world. The small-scale experimental methodologies are categorised into thermogravimetry apparatus (TG), specialised pyrolysers (Py), calorimeters and tubular flow reactors. Each experimental methodology affords a range of analytical techniques which can be used to identify and quantify decomposition products; such as, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, quadrupole mass spectrometry (TG, DSC, QMS). A critical evaluation of these techniques forms an integral part of this review. Both TG and Py serve as fast techniques to study the combustion products of pesticides, but are unsuitable for determining ultra-trace pollutants, e.g., polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). The cone calorimeter has been widely applied to assess the fire behaviour of materials. Unfortunately, sample sizes required for experiments in the cone calorimeter and in larger scale tests may lead to emissions of toxic species to the environment with the exhaust gases, requiring careful planning of experiments. Tubular flow reactor systems are designed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms that operate during decomposition of pesticides in the combustion systems. The coupling of a flow reactor to various analytical techniques can offer the comprehensive analysis of combustion products, including gaseous species, volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOC, SVOC) and PCDD/F. Although much remains to be done, advances in the field have provided regulators and the scientific communities with qualitative and quantitative knowledge of toxic products formed in the combustion of some pesticides, to reduce the potential risks of pesticides combustion and gain an understanding into their thermal decomposition mechanisms.",

Crops identified as suitable for Northern Europe include Miscanthus, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and short rotation coppice willow and poplar (Salix and Populus spp.). All of these crops provide biomass that is amenable for conversion by thermochemical processes i.e. those based on heat and pressure. There are concerns that for some processes the conversion efficiency of biomass is poor compared with coal and oil due to comparatively low energy density, high moisture content, and poor storage and handling properties. Many of these parameters can be improved by pre-processing feed stock materials prior to their conversion. We examine the energy crop species that are suitable for Northern Europe; discuss the processes of combustion, gasification and pyrolysis, and explore how differences in chemical composition influence conversion efficiency. Finally, we review biomass upgrading (pelletisation, torrefaction and treatment with sub-critical (hydrothermal upgrading) and with supercritical water).",

     "abstract": "Oxy-fuel combustion has generated significant interest since it was proposed as a carbon capture technology for newly built and retrofitted coal-fired power plants. Research, development and demonstration of oxy-fuel combustion technologies has been advancing in recent years; however, there are still fundamental issues and technological challenges that must be addressed before this technology can reach its full potential, especially in the areas of combustion in oxygen-carbon dioxide environments and potentially at elevated pressures. This paper presents a technical review of oxy-coal combustion covering the most recent experimental and simulation studies, and numerical models for sub-processes are also used to examine the differences between combustion in an oxidizing stream diluted by nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The evolution of this technology from its original inception for high temperature processes to its current form for carbon capture is introduced, followed by a discussion of various oxy-fuel systems proposed for carbon capture. Of all these oxy-fuel systems, recent research has primarily focused on atmospheric air-like oxy-fuel combustion in a CO2-rich environment. Distinct heat and mass transfer, as well as reaction kinetics, have been reported in this environment because of the difference between the physical and chemical properties of CO2 and N2, which in turn changes the flame characteristics. By tracing the physical and chemical processes that coal particles experience during combustion, the characteristics of oxy-fuel combustion are reviewed in the context of heat and mass transfer, fuel delivery and injection, coal particle heating and moisture evaporation, devolatilization and ignition, char oxidation and gasification, as well as pollutants formation. Operation under elevated pressures has also been proposed for oxy-coal combustion systems in order to improve the overall energy efficiency. The potential impact of elevated pressures on oxy-fuel combustion is discussed when applicable. Narrower flammable regimes and lower laminar burning velocity under oxy-fuel combustion conditions may lead to new stability challenges in operating oxy-coal burners. Recent research on stabilization of oxy-fuel combustion is reviewed, and some guiding principles for retrofit are summarized. Distinct characteristics in oxy-coal combustion necessitate modifications of CFD sub-models because the approximations and assumptions for air-fuel combustion may no longer be valid. Advances in sub-models for turbulent flow, heat transfer and reactions in oxy-coal combustion simulations, and the results obtained using CFD are reviewed. Based on the review, research needs in this combustion technology are suggested.",

     "abstract": "This work is a comprehensive review of the Chemical-Looping Combustion (CLC) and Chemical-Looping Reforming (CLR) processes reporting the main advances in these technologies up to 2010. These processes are based on the transfer of the oxygen from air to the fuel by means of a solid oxygen-carrier avoiding direct contact between fuel and air for different final purposes. CLC has arisen during last years as a very promising combustion technology for power plants and industrial applications with inherent CO2 capture which avoids the energetic penalty present in other competing technologies. CLR uses the chemical looping cycles for H2 production with additional advantages if CO2 capture is also considered.The review compiles the main milestones reached during last years in the development of these technologies regarding the use of gaseous or solid fuels, the oxygen-carrier development, the continuous operation experience, and modelling at several scales. Up to 2010, more than 700 different materials based on Ni, Cu, Fe, Mn, Co, as well as other mixed oxides and low cost materials, have been compiled. Especial emphasis has been done in those oxygen-carriers tested under continuous operation in Chemical-Looping prototypes. The total time of operational experience (\u22483500\u00a0h) in different CLC units in the size range 0.3\u2013120\u00a0kWth, has allowed to demonstrate the technology and to gain in maturity. To help in the design, optimization, and scale-up of the CLC process, modelling work is also reviewed. Different levels of modelling have been accomplished, including fundamentals of the gas-solid reactions in the oxygen-carriers, modelling of the air- and fuel-reactors, and integration of the CLC systems in the power plant. Considering the great advances reached up to date in a very short period of time, it can be said that CLC and CLR are very promising technologies within the framework of the CO2 capture options.",

     "abstract": "Faced with the energy crisis and environmental degradation, due to the massive use of fossil energy sources, biodiesel is an attractive alternative to diesel fuel. With a view to developing local biodiesel production, using bioethanol as a sustainable reactant for biodiesel production, rather than methanol, is leading to increasing interest, notably in emerging countries. Indeed, bioethanol, which is less toxic than methanol, is produced from local and renewable agricultural resources, being more sustainable and providing access to greater energy independence. However, some issues are limiting the process like purification problems, or the presence of water in bioethanol leading to a drop in yield. Although several studies have already been published on ethyl ester production, most of them primarily focus on homogeneous alkaline catalysis, and report various data. Therefore, this paper aims at presenting a review of previous studies on the subject.The aim of this article was to analyze all the literature data available on ethyl ester production, to gain a clearer insight into the advances made in the process, and bring out prospects for developing ethyl ester production, along with the limitations.This paper compares the different catalytic pathways that have been investigated for ethyl ester production. It discusses the effect of the main reaction parameters on the yield, the purification issues, and the characteristics and specifications of ethyl esters. This study shows that all authors formerly agreed in saying that ethyl esters separation and purification were a limiting stage. But these limitations can be overcome as high yields over 90% can be obtained by optimizing all the reaction parameters. Moreover, the negative effect of the water contained in bioethanol remains controversial.Finally, ethyl esters proved to be a viable alternative to diesel fuel being more sustainable than methyl esters. Some aspects of their production are worth a closer look for shifting the use of bioethanol to large-scale production.",

While the reactions are thermodynamically favourable, in nature the process occurs over thousands of years. The challenge of mineral carbon sequestration is to accelerate carbonation and exploit the heat of reaction with minimal energy and material losses. Minerals commonly selected for carbonation include calcium and magnesium silicates. These minerals require energy-intensive pre-treatments, such as fine grinding, heat treatment, and chemical activation with strong acids, to provide adequate conversions and reaction kinetics. Industrial waste residues present alternative sources of mineral alkalinity that are more reactive than primary minerals and are readily and cheaply available close to CO2 sources. In addition, the carbonation of waste\u00a0residues often improves their environmental stability. This paper provides an overview of the types of industrials wastes that can be used for mineral carbon sequestration and the process routes available.",

     "abstract": "This review deals with the most recent achievements in experimental investigations of the process of carbon nanoparticle formation, at pyrolysis of various carbon bearing species behind shock waves. The diverse diagnostic methods of these processes are described; special attention is given to new methods for measuring the current sizes and optical properties of particles and the temperature of the reacting mixture using time resolved laser-induced incandescence (LII), and IR emission-absorption spectroscopy. The main part of the review provides critical analysis of the numerous results of the kinetics of particle formation at various temperatures, pressures and concentrations of carbon. Particular emphasis is placed on the results obtained by pyrolysis of hydrogen free precursors. It is shown that recent measurements of size dependence of the optical properties of particles, actual temperature of the mixture during pyrolysis of initial substances, and the subsequent growth of nanoparticles require a serious revision of current conceptions regarding the temperature dependence of particle yield and growth rate. Based on this analysis, unified regularities in these processes, with various temperatures and types of initial substances, are suggested. The last section of the paper contains a short review of the methods for modeling the processes of carbon nanoparticle formation in shock waves. Emphasis is placed on the necessity for the elaboration of more general models describing the detailed changes in particle properties during the growth process and the unified regularities of particle growth from hydrocarbons and hydrogen-free precursors as determined in experiments.",

     "abstract": "Recent advances in diagnostic methods are providing new capacity for detailed measurement of turbulent, reacting flows that are strongly radiating. Radiation becomes increasingly significant in flames containing soot and/or fine particles, and also increases with physical size. Therefore many flames of practical significance are strongly radiating. Under these conditions, the coupling between the turbulence, chemistry and radiative heat transfer processes is significant, making it necessary to obtain simultaneous measurement of controlling parameters. These environments are also particularly challenging for laser-based measurements, since soot and other particles increase the interferences to the signal and the attenuation of the beam. The paper reviews the influence of physical scale and of the properties of the\u00a0medium on approaches to perform measurements in such strongly radiating flows. It then reviews the recent advances in techniques to measure temperature, mixture fraction, soot volume fraction, velocity, particle number density and the scattered, absorbed and transmitted components of radiation propagation through particle laden systems. Finally it also considers remaining challenges to diagnostic techniques under such conditions.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we identify and characterize known and new environmental consequences associated with CO2 capture from power plants, transport by pipeline and storage in geological formations. We have reviewed (analogous) environmental impact assessment procedures and scientific literature on carbon capture and storage (CCS) options. Analogues include the construction of new power plants, transport of natural gas by pipelines, underground natural gas storage (UGS), natural gas production and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. It is investigated whether crucial knowledge on environmental impacts is lacking that may postpone the implementation of CCS projects. This review shows that the capture of CO2 from power plants results in a change in the environmental profile of the power plant. This change encompasses both increase and reduction of key atmospheric emissions, being: NOx, SO2, NH3, particulate matter, Hg, HF and HCl. The largest trade-offs are found for the emission of NOx and NH3 when equipping power plants with post-combustion capture. Synergy is expected for SO2 emissions, which are low for all power plants with CO2 capture. An increase in water consumption ranging between 32% and 93% and an increase in waste and by-product creation with tens of kilotonnes annually is expected for a large-scale power plant (1\u00a0GWe), but exact flows and composition are uncertain. The cross-media effects of CO2 capture are found to be uncertain and to a large extent not quantified. For the assessment of the safety of CO2 transport by pipeline at high pressure an important knowledge gap is the absence of validated release and dispersion models for CO2 releases. We also highlight factors that result in some (not major) uncertainties when estimating the failure rates for CO2 pipelines. Furthermore, uniform CO2 exposure thresholds, detailed dose\u2013response models and specific CO2 pipeline regulation are absent. Most gaps in environmental information regarding the CCS chain are identified and characterized for the risk assessment of the underground, non-engineered, part of the storage activity. This uncertainty is considered to be larger for aquifers than for hydrocarbon reservoirs. Failure rates are found to be heavily based on expert opinions and the dose\u2013response models for ecosystems or target species are not yet developed. Integration and validation of various sub-models describing fate and transport of CO2 in various compartments of the geosphere is at an infant stage. In conclusion, it is not possible to execute a quantitative risk assessment for the non-engineered part of the storage activity with high confidence.",

     "abstract": "This article presents a consistent techno-economic assessment and comparison of CO2 capture technologies for key industrial sectors (iron and steel, cement, petroleum refineries and petrochemicals). The assessment is based on an extensive literature review, covering studies from both industries and academia. Key parameters, e.g., capacity factor (91\u201397%), energy prices (natural gas: 8 \u20ac2007/GJ, coal: 2.5 \u20ac2007/GJ, grid electricity: 55\u00a0\u20ac/MWh), interest rate (10%), economic plant lifetime (20 years), CO2 compression pressure (110\u00a0bar), and grid electricity CO2 intensity (400\u00a0g/kWh), were standardized to enable a fair comparison of technologies. The analysis focuses on the changes in energy, CO2 emissions and material flows, due to the deployment of CO2 capture technologies. CO2 capture technologies are categorized into short-mid term (ST/MT) and long term (LT) technologies. The findings of this study identified a large number of technologies under development, but it is too soon to identify which technologies would become dominant in the future. Moreover, a good integration of industrial plants and power plants is essential for cost-effective CO2 capture because CO2 capture may increase the industrial onsite electricity production significantly.For the iron and steel sector, 40\u201365\u00a0\u20ac/tCO2 avoided may be achieved in the ST/MT, depending on the ironmaking process and the CO2 capture technique. Advanced LT CO2 capture technologies for the blast furnace based process may not offer significant advantages over conventional ones (30\u201355\u00a0\u20ac/tCO2 avoided). Rather than the performance of CO2 capture technique itself, low-cost CO2 emissions reduction comes from good integration of CO2 capture to the ironmaking process. Advanced smelting reduction with integrated CO2 capture may enable lower steel production cost and lower CO2 emissions than the blast furnace based process, i.e., negative CO2 mitigation cost. For the cement sector, post-combustion capture appears to be the only commercial technology in the ST/MT and the costs are above 65\u00a0\u20ac/tCO2 avoided. In the LT, a number of technologies may enable 25\u201355\u00a0\u20ac/tCO2 avoided. The findings also indicate that, in some cases, partial CO2 capture may have comparative advantages. For the refining and petrochemical sectors, oxyfuel capture was found to be more economical than others at 50\u201360\u00a0\u20ac/tCO2 avoided in ST/MT and about 30\u00a0\u20ac/tCO2 avoided in the LT. However, oxyfuel retrofit of furnaces and heaters may be more complicated than that of boilers.Crude estimates of technical potentials for global CO2 emissions reduction for 2030 were made for the industrial processes investigated with the ST/MT technologies. They amount up to about 4\u00a0Gt/yr: 1\u00a0Gt/yr for the iron and steel sector, about 2\u00a0Gt/yr for the cement sector, and 1\u00a0Gt/yr for petroleum refineries. The actual deployment level would be much lower due to various constraints, about 0.8\u00a0Gt/yr, in a stringent emissions reduction scenario.",

The constitutive equations together with the length and time scales of DEM are compared with those of other similar Lagrangian particle methods, e.g.,\u00a0molecular dynamics (MD), Brownian dynamics (BD), dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). The adhesive contact force and torque models in the presence of different adhesive effects are examined, including van der Waals force, ligand-receptor binding, liquid bridging force, interface adhesion, and sintering forces, all of which play an important role in DEM formulations for different types of adhesive particulate flow problems of interest in energy, combustion and environmental fluid mechanics problems. A summary of various kinds of particle-field interactions is presented, including fluid forces, electric field forces, acoustic force, and thermophoretic force. The computational method is illustrated by application to a series of examples involving capture of spherical particles by a fiber in a uniform upstream flow, examining the deposition/aggregation patterns of both mono-size and binary-size particles on the cylinder with and without the presence of electric field effects, which may be due either to charging of the cylinder or polarization of the particles. Particle capture problems of this sort are commonly encountered in filtration problems and ash-removal problems experienced in environmental and combustion applications, respectively. The article concludes with a discussion of remaining modeling challenges in development of discrete-element methods for adhesive particulate flow fields.",

In this paper, the recent technological development of micro-power systems and progress in fundamental understanding of micro-scale combustion are reviewed. At first, micro-scale combustion regimes are categorized by using different physical and chemical length and time scales and the resulting non-dimensional parameters and their correlations to various combustion regimes for micro and mesoscale combustion are discussed. Secondly, the recent successful developments and technical challenges of micro-thrusters, micro internal combustion engines, and micro chemical reactors summarized. Thirdly, the underlying fundamental mechanisms and ignition and flame dynamics in micro-scale combustion are reviewed, respectively, in premixed, non-premixed, catalytic, and non-equilibrium, micro-scale combustion systems. The conventional concepts of combustion limits such as the flammability limit, quenching diameter, and flame extinction and heat recirculation are revisited. The unique thermal and chemical transport mechanisms such as flame structure interaction, radical quenching, non-equilibrium transport appearing in micro-scale combustion are discussed. New flame regimes and instabilities such as flame bifurcation, weak flames, flame cells/streets, thermal and kinetic quenching, flameless low temperature catalytic combustion, repetitive extinction and ignition, spinning flames, spiral and multi-branched flames, symmetric and asymmetric oscillating flames are discussed.

In this review we summarize the current state of Eulerian transport models for turbulent polydispersed particulate flows without size class discretization. The stochastic nature of both carrier and dispersed phase justifies a stochastic approach to describe the behavior of such systems. In this regard Brownian motion of a single microscopic particle is discussed to intuitively introduce the subject and point out the need for a stochastic representation of the phenomena based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Understanding the stochastic tools and mathematical framework based on Langevin equation is compulsory for the rest of this review but here we restrict our coverage to definitions and general remarks and give references for further readings. A stochastic foundation based on Langevin equation is defined for fluid and particle and derivation of the transport equation up to third order statistics without binning the particle diameter is discussed based on corresponding Fokker\u2013Planck equation. Terms that appear in the process of contracting a probability density function (PDF) causing closure problems are identified.

     "abstract": "Due to concerns regarding the greenhouse effect and limitations on carbon dioxide emissions, the possibility of a next-generation combustion mode for internal combustion engines that can simultaneously reduce exhaust emissions and substantially improve thermal efficiency has drawn increasing attention. The most prominent characteristic of new combustion modes, such as Homogenous-Charge Compression-Ignition (HCCI), Stratified-Charge Compression-Ignition (SCCI), and Low-Temperature Combustion (LTC), is the requirement of creating a homogenous mixture or controllable stratified mixture prior to ignition. To this end, a lean fuel/air mixture and/or a controllable high level of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are employed to prolong the timescale of the ignition chemistry and port fuel injection or early in-cylinder injection is used to lengthen the mixing period. The mixture then undergoes controlled self-ignition near the top dead center (TDC) position due to the compression effect of the piston\u2019s upward movement. It is worth noting that the entire combustion process lacks a direct method for the control of ignition timing and combustion rate, which are instead controlled primarily by chemical kinetics and, to a lesser extent, by turbulence and mixing. Because of the significant impacts of fuel physical\u2013chemical properties on the ignition and combustion process, fuel design and management has become the most common approach for the control of ignition timing and combustion rate in such advanced combustion modes.This paper summarizes the concepts and methods of fuel design and management and provides an overview of the effects of these strategies on ignition, combustion, and emissions for HCCI, LTC, and SCCI engines, respectively. From part 2 to part 4, the paper focuses on the effect of fuel design on HCCI combustion. A fuel index suitable for describing ignition characteristic under HCCI operating conditions is first introduced. Next, the proposed fuel design concept is described, including principles and main methodologies. Strategies based on the fuel design concept (including fuel additives, fuel blending, and dual-fuel technology) are discussed for primary reference fuels (PRF), alternative fuels, and practical gasoline and diesel fuels. Additionally, the effects of real-time fuel design on HCCI combustion fueled with PRFs and dimethyl ether/liquefied petroleum gas (DME\u2013LPG) are evaluated. Diesel HCCI combustion has suffered from difficulties in homogenous mixture formation and an excessively high combustion rate. Therefore, LTC, which concentrates on local combustion temperature and a balance of mixture formation timescale and ignition timescale, has been proposed by many researchers. In Part 5, this paper provides an overview of the major points and research progress of LTC, with a preliminary discussion of the fundamental importance of fuel properties and fuel design strategy on the LTC process and emissions. Due to the stratification strategy has the capable of extending the HCCI operation range to higher loads, SCCI combustion, which incorporates HCCI combustion into a traditional combustion mode, has the potential to be used in commercial engines. Thus, this paper discusses the principles and control strategies of fuel design and management and also summarizes recent progress and future trends. The effect of fuel design and management on SCCI combustion is assessed for high cetane number fuels and high octane number fuels as well as the in SCCI combustion of gasoline\u2013diesel dual-fuel and blends.",

The high intensity, coherence, high spectral resolution and frequency tunability available from laser radiation has provided powerful tools for studying microscopic processes and macroscopic phenomena in combustion by linear and non-linear optical processes. This review focuses on non-linear optical techniques based on resonant four-wave mixing for non-intrusive measurements of minor species in combustion. The importance of minor species such as reaction intermediates is outlined together with the challenges they present for detection and measurement in the hostile environments of flames, technical combustors, and engines. The limitations of conventional optical methods for such measurements are described and the particular advantages of coherent methods using non-linear optical techniques are discussed. The basic physics underlying four-wave mixing processes and theoretical models for signal calculation are then presented together with a discussion of how combustion parameters may be derived from analysis of signals generated in various four-wave mixing processes. The most important four-wave mixing processes, in this context, are then reviewed: Degenerate Four-Wave Mixing (DFWM), Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS), Laser Induced Grating Spectroscopy (LIGS) and Polarization Spectroscopy (PS). In each case the fundamental physics is outlined to explain the particular properties and diagnostic advantages of each technique. The application of the methods mentioned to molecular physics studies of combustion species is then reviewed along with their application in measurement of concentration, temperature and other combustion parameters. Related non-linear techniques and recent extensions to the ultra-fast regime are briefly reviewed.

     "abstract": "This review examines current approximations and approaches that underlie the evaluation of transport properties for combustion modeling applications. Discussed in the review are: the intermolecular potential and its descriptive molecular parameters; various approaches to evaluating collision integrals; supporting data required for the evaluation of transport properties; commonly used computer programs for predicting transport properties; the quality of experimental measurements and their importance for validating or rejecting approximations to property estimation; the interpretation of corresponding states; combination rules that yield pair molecular potential parameters for unlike species from like species parameters; and mixture approximations. The insensitivity of transport properties to the intermolecular forces is noted, especially the non-uniqueness of the supporting potential parameters. Viscosity experiments of pure substances and binary mixtures measured post 1970 are used to evaluate a number of approximations; the intermediate temperature range 1\u00a0<\u00a0T\u2217\u00a0<\u00a010, where T\u2217 is kT/\u03b5, is emphasized since this is where rich data sets are available. When suitable potential parameters are used, errors in transport property predictions for pure non-polar substances and their binary mixtures are less than 5% when they are calculated using the approaches of Kee et\u00a0al.; Mason, Kestin, and Uribe; Paul and Warnatz; or Ern and Giovangigli. Recommendations stemming from the review include (1) revisiting the supporting data required by the various computational approaches, and updating the data sets with accurate potential parameters, dipole moments, and polarizabilities; (2) characterizing the range of parameter space over which the fit to experimental data is good, rather than the current practice of reporting only the parameter set that best fits the data; (3) looking for improved combining rules, since existing rules were found to under-predict the viscosity of mixtures in most cases; (4) performing more transport property measurements for mixtures that include radical species, an important but neglected area; (5) using the TRANLIB approach for treating polar molecules; (6) continuing to evaluate whether a different parameterization is required for the intermolecular potential for T\u2217\u00a0>\u00a010; (7) performing more accurate measurements of the molecular parameters used to evaluate the molecular heat capacity and the rotational relaxation collision number, since they affect thermal conductivity; and (8) using the EGLIB approach and computer program with improved supporting data to evaluate transport properties.

     "abstract": "The miniaturization of electro-mechanical devices, and the resulting need for micro-power generation (milliwatts to watts) with low weight, long life devices, has lead to the recent development of the field of micro-scale combustion and power generation. The primary objective of this new field is to leverage the high energy density of fuels, specifically liquid hydrocarbon fuels relative to batteries and all other energy storage devices other than nuclear fission, fusion or decay. As such, a miniaturized device even with a moderately efficient conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to power would result in increased lifetime and/or reduced weight of an electronic or mechanical system that are currently most often powered by electrochemical cells. Furthermore, improvements in this field may make possible novel applications and/or capability. In addition to the interest in miniaturization, the field is also driven by the potential fabrication of the devices using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or rapid prototyping techniques, with their favorable characteristics for mass production and/or low unit cost. The micro-power generation field is very young, and still is in most cases in the feasibility stage. However, considering that it is a new frontier of technological development, and that only a few projects have been funded, it can be said that significant progress has been made to date. Currently there is consensus, at least among those working in the field, that combustion at the micro-scale is possible with proper thermal and chemical management. Several meso-scale and micro-scale combustors have been developed that appear to operate with good combustion efficiency. Some of these combustors have been applied to energize thermoelectric systems to produce power, although with low overall efficiency. Several turbines/engines have also been, or are being, developed, some of them currently producing positive power, albeit with low efficiency. Micro-rockets using solid or liquid fuels have been built and shown to produce thrust. More detailed scaling/modeling efforts are required to improve existing designs. Improvements in diagnostic, control and computational tools are expected to have a significant impact on the development of the field. Some brief scaling arguments are given in this work, and more detailed efforts are referred. A brief introduction to several of the fabrication techniques is presented in this work. Hydrogen-based and some preliminary specialty fuel micro-fuel cells have been successfully developed, and there is a need to develop reliable reformers (or direct conversion fuel cells) for liquid hydrocarbons so that the fuel cells become competitive with the batteries. In this work, the technological issues related to micro-scale combustion and the development of thermochemical devices for power generation will be discussed. Some of the systems currently being developed will be presented, ongoing critical research issues under investigation, and other potential areas of development discussed.

Data is presented for both pyrolytic product distribution (yields of char, total liquids, water, total gas and individual gas species) and properties (elemental composition and heating value) showing clear dependencies on peak temperature. Empirical relationships are derived from the collected data, over a wide range of pyrolysis conditions and considering a variety of fuels, including relations between the yields of gas-phase volatiles and thermochemical properties of char, tar and gas. An empirical model for the stoichiometry of biomass pyrolysis is presented, where empirical parameters are introduced to close the conservation equations describing the process. The composition of pyrolytic volatiles is described by means of a relevant number of species: H2O, tar, CO2, CO, H2, CH4 and other light hydrocarbons. The model is here primarily used as a tool in the analysis of the general trends of biomass pyrolysis, enabling also to verify the consistency of the collected data. Comparison of model results with the literature data shows that the information on product properties is well correlated with the one on product distribution. The prediction capability of the model is briefly addressed, with the results showing that the yields of volatiles released from a specific biomass are predicted with a reasonable accuracy. Particle models of the type presented in this study can be useful as a submodel in comprehensive reactor models simulating pyrolysis, gasification or combustion processes.",

     "abstract": "Temperature is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter used to describe physical, chemical and biological processes. In combustion as in many other applications, knowledge about temperature plays a substantial role in helping to maintain an efficient and clean environment. Being able to measure temperature accurately in combustion and in fire-related applications is important for giving a better understanding of heat transfer phenomena and improving existing models.In the present review paper a method based on the spectroscopy of inorganic luminescent materials is described and exemplified in experiments related to combustion. The method involves the use of thermographic phosphors which enable remote temperature diagnostics to be performed with a high degree of sensitivity and accuracy. The technique is superior to those based on thermocouples and pyrometry, particularly in the vicinity of flames and when the measured surface is subjected to random movements. Several phosphor materials suitable for temperature probing are described. The application of thermographic phosphors to temperature measurements in one-point and in two-dimensions in flame spread scenarios, and in pyrolysis experiments involving different construction materials and polymers are described. Many thermographic phosphors have the property of being insensitive to variations in pressure up to 1\u00a0GPa. This property extends the use and development of thermographic thermometry to other domains, such as internal combustion engines. The temperature has been measured in a point and in two-dimensions inside the combustion chamber. The complex procedures required to implement the use of thermocouples on moving objects inside an engine make thermocouples an expensive choice. It also limits the possibilities of altering the measurement locations and thereby also complicating the investigation of different engine geometries and components.Thermographic phosphors have also been employed in gas turbine applications. Temperature probing in the afterburner of a full-size aircraft engine is described with the aim to study the effects of various engine loads on the wall temperature. Furthermore, the application of thermographic phosphors to study the temperature of droplets in relation to sprays is described. In spray dynamics, temperature is a crucial parameter for gaining an understanding of atomisation, evaporation and heat convection from the surrounding gases. Finally the application of thermographic phosphors for gas temperature measurement by seeding the particles into a gas flow is described together with the challenges associated with seeding the particles for in-situ flame measurements.",

     "abstract": "Rising concern about the effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on climate change is pushing national governments and the international community to achieve sustainable development in an economy that is less dependent on carbon emitting activities \u2013 a vision that is usually termed a \u201clow-carbon society\u201d (LCS). Since the utilization of energy resources is the main source of GHG emissions, restructuring current energy systems in order to incorporate low-carbon energy technologies is essential for the realization of the LCS vision. Energy policies promoting the penetration of these technologies must view the role of energy in society as a system, composed of several energy resources, conversion technologies and energy demand sectors. The feasibility of the LCS in the future can be better understood by means of energy models. Energy models are valuable mathematical tools based on the systems approach. They have been applied to aid decision-making in energy planning, to analyze energy policies and to analyze the implications arising from the introduction of technologies. The design of the LCS requires innovative energy systems considering a trans-disciplinary approach that integrates multi-dimensional elements, related to social, economic, and environmental aspects. This paper reviews the application of energy models considering scenarios towards an LCS under the energy systems approach. The models reviewed consider the utilization of waste for energy, the penetration of clean coal technologies, transportation sector models as a sample of sectoral approaches, and models related to energy-for-development issues in rural areas of developing countries.",

Variations of the F\u2013T process can be used to tailor the fuel properties to meet end user needs as well as aid vehicle manufacturers in achieving forthcoming emission regulations.

Regardless of feedstock or process, F\u2013T diesel fuels typically have a number of very desirable properties, including a very high cetane number. This review focuses on how fuel properties impact pollutant emissions and draws together data from various studies that have been carried out over the past few years. Reduced emission levels as demonstrated in several publications have been attributed to several chemical and physical characteristics of the F\u2013T diesel fuels including reduced density, ultra-low sulfur levels, low aromatic content and high cetane rating, but not all of them contribute to the same extent to the emissions reduction.",

     "abstract": "Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has been recognized as a promising zero-emission power source for portable, mobile and stationary applications. To simultaneously ensure high membrane proton conductivity and sufficient reactant delivery to reaction sites, water management has become one of the most important issues for PEMFC commercialization, and proper water management requires good understanding of water transport in different components of PEMFC. In this paper, previous researches related to water transport in PEMFC are comprehensively reviewed. The state and transport mechanism of water in different components are elaborated in detail. Based on the literature review, it is found that experimental techniques have been developed to predict distributions of water, gas species, temperature and other parameters in PEMFC. However, difficulties still remain for simultaneous measurements of multiple parameters, and the cell and system design modifications required by measurements need to be minimized. Previous modeling work on water transport in PEMFC involves developing rule-based and first-principle-based models, and first-principle-based models involve multi-scale methods from atomistic to full cell levels. Different models have been adopted for different purposes and they all together can provide a comprehensive view of water transport in PEMFC. With the development of computational power, application of lower length scale methods to higher length scales for more accurate and comprehensive results is feasible in the future. Researches related to cold start (startup from subzero temperatures) and high temperature PEMFC (HT-PEMFC) (operating at the temperatures higher than 100\u00a0\u00b0C) are also reviewed. Ice formation that hinders reactant delivery and damages cell materials is the major issue for PEMFC cold start, and enhancing water absorption by membrane electrolyte and external heating have been identified as the most effective ways to reduce ice formation and accelerate temperature increment. HT-PEMFC that can operate without liquid water formation and membrane hydration greatly simplifies water management strategy, and promising performance of HT-PEMFC has been demonstrated.",

     "abstract": "Increasing demand for energy, energy security and the need to minimize the impact on the environment related to energy are the major drivers for the research and development of alternative energy technologies. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a promising alternative technology. However, their performance, in other words efficiency, can be hindered severely by the presence of contaminants. Impurities in the oxidant and fuel feeds act as barriers to the oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation. These impurities arise from the use of atmospheric air as the oxidant and hydrogen from reformate as the fuel. The electrolyte membrane can be attacked by ions originating from the cell components. These ions decrease the mechanical and chemical stability of the membrane resulting in the decrease of proton conductivity and reactant crossover. Due to the severity of these poisoning phenomena, much work has been dedicated to understanding their chemical kinetics, their effects and mitigation methods. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the experimental, analytical and numerical work devoted to understanding the contamination of the cathode, electrolyte membrane and anode. A summary of future directions and research topics is also given.",

     "abstract": "There has been much recent progress in the area of surrogate fuels for diesel. In the last few years, experiments and modeling have been performed on higher molecular weight components of relevance to diesel fuel such as n-hexadecane (n-cetane) and 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane (iso-cetane). Chemical kinetic models have been developed for all the n-alkanes up to 16 carbon atoms. Also, there has been experimental and modeling work on lower molecular weight surrogate components such as n-decane and n-dodecane that are most relevant to jet fuel surrogates, but are also relevant to diesel surrogates where simulation of the full boiling point range is desired. For two-ring compounds, experimental work on decalin and tetralin recently has been published. For esters, kinetic mechanisms for compounds of lower molecular weights but similar to those found in typical biodiesel blendstocks also have been published. For multi-component surrogate fuel mixtures, recent work on modeling of these mixtures and comparisons to real diesel fuel is reviewed. Detailed chemical kinetic models for surrogate fuels are very large in size, so it is noteworthy that significant progress also has been made in improving the mechanism reduction tools that are needed to make these large models practicable in multi-dimensional reacting flow simulations of diesel combustion. Nevertheless, major research gaps remain. In the case of iso-alkanes, there are experiments and modeling work on only one of relevance to diesel: iso-cetane. Also, the iso-alkanes in diesel are lightly branched and no detailed chemical kinetic models or experimental investigations are available for such compounds. More components are needed to fill out the iso-alkane boiling point range. For the aromatic class of compounds, there has been little work for compounds in the boiling point range of diesel. Most of the new work has been on alkyl aromatics that are of the range C7\u2013C9, below the C10\u2013C20 range that is needed. For the chemical classes of cycloalkanes and esters, experiments and modeling on higher molecular weight components are warranted. Finally for multi-component surrogates needed to treat real diesel, the inclusion of higher molecular weight components is needed in models and experimental investigations.",

     "abstract": "Bioethanol continues to be offered as a viable solution for complex problems ranging from global warming and national energy security to local economic development. Fuel bioethanol burns cleaner than gasoline, is derived from renewable agricultural products, and creates local jobs and income. In December 2007, President Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which increased the renewable fuel standard that was mandated under energy Policy Act of 2005 to 36 billion gallons by 2022.In order to achieve this goal, ethanol production would need to be generated primarily from corn and cellulosic materials. Bioethanol producers are currently involved in variety of technological innovations to reduce energy consumption and production costs, increased efficiency and reduced emissions using the best available control technologies. However, industrial ethanol fermentation is a non-sterile process and contaminant microorganisms can lead to a decrease in industrial productivity and significant economic loss. Currently, bioethanol industries use different antimicrobials including antibiotics to control the contaminants in the fermentors. The emergence of antibiotic resistance among contaminant bacteria in bioethanol fermentors warrants the need for alternative antimicrobials to retain bioethanol production at a profitable level. In addition more and more ethanol producers are seeking to generate distillers grains that can be labeled antibiotic free to be sold in international markets where some restrictions are already in place for reducing and/or eliminating antibiotics usage in animal feed. This review examines the contamination problems, various intervention methods, emergence of antibiotic resistance in contaminant bacteria, and potential alternative options to elucidate antimicrobial products from various natural sources. In particular, emphasis has been given for natural antibacterial products from plant derived products to suggest a new research avenue for the search of new, non-conventional antimicrobial agents to control the contamination problem in the fuel bioethanol industries.",

     "abstract": "Burgeoning global demand for energy has increased concerns about the fuel security issues and deleterious environmental impacts that result from the ubiquitous use of fossil fuels to meet these needs. This article is a review of completed work towards the goal of creating chemical kinetic mechanisms for biodiesel, which will aid in the development of clean and efficient combustors that utilize alternative fuels. As the composition of biodiesel is too complex to directly model, efforts have instead focused on the development of mechanisms for surrogates, simpler molecules that can produce the primary characteristics of biodiesel combustion. Research initially targeted smaller molecules like methyl butanoate to investigate the role of the characteristic ester group that is present in the fatty acid alkyl esters that comprise biodiesel. The study of isomers and similar unsaturated compounds elucidated the effects of molecular structure on combustion. Subsequent efforts involved the study of larger molecules that are close in scale to biodiesel molecules, such as methyl decanoate, as well as molecules that are present in biodiesel, such as methyl stearate. Applications of kinetic modeling demonstrate its utility in the study of combustion through, for example, revealing the chemistry in the early formation of CO2 in biodiesel and its soot reduction tendencies. The results of this review illustrate key limitations in kinetic modeling, namely a need for high-pressure kinetic methodology and a need for continuous improvement of kinetic mechanisms through theory and experiment. These limitations suggest direction for future research; further experimental and theoretical work will produce accurate mechanisms for appropriate biodiesel surrogates. All of these efforts represent significant advances in kinetic modeling that are important towards the goal of building a predictive capability for biodiesel combustion. Such predictive capability will aid the development of combustion technologies that will help society meet its energy needs in an environmentally conscious manner.",

The developed world has become accustomed to cheap and plentiful supplies. Recently, more of the developing world populations are striving for the same, and taking steps towards securing their future energy needs. Competition over limited supplies of conventional fossil fuel resources is intensifying, and more challenging environmental problems are springing up, especially related to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. There is strong evidence that atmospheric CO2 concentration is well correlated with the average global temperature. Moreover, model predictions indicate that the century-old observed trend of rising temperatures could accelerate as carbon dioxide concentration continues to rise. Given the potential danger of such a scenario, it is suggested that steps be taken to curb energy-related CO2 emissions through a number of technological solutions, which are to be implemented in a timely fashion. These solutions include a substantial improvement in energy conversion and utilization efficiencies, carbon capture and sequestration, and expanding the use of nuclear energy and renewable sources. Some of these technologies already exist, but are not deployed at sufficiently large scale. Others are under development, and some are at or near the conceptual state.",

Sulphur has been shown in the study to have impacts in the furnace, during ash collection, CO2 compression and transport as well as storage, with many options for its removal or impact control. In particular, the effect of sulphur containing species can pose a risk for corrosion throughout the plant and transport pipelines. This paper presents a technical review of all laboratory and pilot work to identify impacts of sulphur impurities from throughout the oxy-fuel process, from combustion, gas cleaning, compression to sequestration with removal and remedial options. An economic assessment of the optimum removal is not considered. Recent oxy-fuel pilot trials performed in support of the Callide Oxy-fuel Project and other pilot scale data are interpreted and combined with thermodynamic simulations to develop a greater fundamental understanding of the changes incurred by recycling the flue gas.

     "abstract": "Natural gas is a fossil fuel that has been used and investigated extensively for use in spark-ignition (SI) and compression-ignition (CI) engines. Compared with conventional gasoline engines, SI engines using natural gas can run at higher compression ratios, thus producing higher thermal efficiencies but also increased nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, while producing lower emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO). These engines also produce relatively less power than gasoline-fueled engines because of the convergence of one or more of three factors: a reduction in volumetric efficiency due to natural-gas injection in the intake manifold; the lower stoichiometric fuel/air ratio of natural gas compared to gasoline; and the lower equivalence ratio at which these engines may be run in order to reduce NOx emissions. High NOx emissions, especially at high loads, reduce with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). However, EGR rates above a maximum value result in misfire and erratic engine operation. Hydrogen gas addition increases this EGR threshold significantly. In addition, hydrogen increases the flame speed of the natural gas\u2013hydrogen mixture. Power levels can be increased with supercharging or turbocharging and intercooling. Natural gas is used to power CI engines via the dual-fuel mode, where a high-cetane fuel is injected along with the natural gas in order to provide a source of ignition for the charge. Thermal efficiency levels compared with normal diesel-fueled CI-engine operation are generally maintained with dual-fuel operation, and smoke levels are reduced significantly. At the same time, lower NOx and CO2 emissions, as well as higher HC and CO emissions compared with normal CI-engine operation at low and intermediate loads are recorded. These trends are caused by the low charge temperature and increased ignition delay, resulting in low combustion temperatures. Another factor is insufficient penetration and distribution of the pilot fuel in the charge, resulting in a lack of ignition centers. EGR admission at low and intermediate loads increases combustion temperatures, lowering unburned HC and CO emissions. Larger pilot fuel quantities at these load levels and hydrogen gas addition can also help increase combustion efficiency. Power output is lower at certain conditions than diesel-fueled engines, for reasons similar to those affecting power output of SI engines. In both cases the power output can be maintained with direct injection. Overall, natural gas can be used in both engine types; however further refinement and optimization of engines and fuel-injection systems is needed.",

     "abstract": "Biodiesel has received, and continues to receive, considerable attention for its potential use as an augmenting fuel to petroleum diesel. Its advantages include decreased net carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter emissions, and fuel properties similar to petroleum diesel for ease of use in diesel engines. Its disadvantages include poorer cold flow characteristics, lower heating values, and mostly reported higher emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx\u00a0=\u00a0NO\u00a0+\u00a0NO2, where NO is nitric oxide and NO2 is nitrogen dioxide). This latter disadvantage (i.e., higher emissions of oxides of nitrogen) is the focus of this review article. NOx formation mechanisms are complex and affected by several different features (e.g., size, operating points, combustion chamber design, fuel system design, and air system design) of internal combustion engines. The slight differences in properties between biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuels are enough to create several changes to system and combustion behaviors of diesel engines. Combined, these effects lead to several complex and interacting mechanisms that make it difficult to fundamentally identify how biodiesel affects NOx emissions. Instead, it is perhaps better to say that several parameters seem to most strongly influence observed differences in NOx emissions with biodiesel, thus introducing several possibilities for inconsistency in the trends. These parameters are injection timing, adiabatic flame temperature, radiation heat transfer, and ignition delay. This article provides a review of the rich literature describing these parameters, and provides additional insight into the system responses that are manifested by the use of biodiesel.",

The ability to synthesize and control carbon nanotube orientation, length, diameter, uniformity, purity, and internal morphology is essential for the fabrication of nanomechanical and electrical devices. An understanding of the growth mechanism and development of control methods such as the electric field, particle loading, and nanotemplates is critically important to address these issues. Today, flames are envisioned as the alternative technique for the synthesis of SWNTs in tons/year production scale leading to the development of related technologies such as purification and separation methods.",

     "abstract": "The jet in crossflow or transverse jet has been studied extensively because of its relevance to a wide variety of flows in technological systems, including fuel or dilution air injection in gas turbine engines, thrust vector control for high speed airbreathing and rocket vehicles, and exhaust plumes from power plants. These widespread applications have led over the past 50+ years to experimental, theoretical, and numerical examinations of this fundamental flowfield, with and without a combustion reaction, and with single or multi-phase flow. The complexities in this flowfield, whether the jet is introduced flush with respect to the injection wall or from an elevated pipe or nozzle, present challenges in accurately interrogating, analyzing, and simulating important jet features. This review article provides a background on these studies and applications as well as detailed features of the transverse jet, and mechanisms for its control via active means. Promising future directions for the understanding, interrogation, simulation, and control of transverse jet flows are also identified and discussed.",

     "abstract": "The impingement of fuel spray onto interposed surfaces in an IC engine, equipped either with a direct or an indirect injection system, is a fundamental issue affecting mixture preparation prior to combustion and, therefore, also affecting engine performance and pollutant emissions. In this context, the development of fuel injection systems relies on accurate knowledge of the fluid dynamic and thermal processes occurring during spray/wall interaction.Injection systems however, are very complex and the background physics requires fundamental studies, performed at simplified flow geometries. In particular, the impact of individual droplets has been extensively used to describe the behaviour of spray impact and to predict its outcome, despite the known fact that a spray does not behave exactly as a summation of individual droplets; then, researchers incorporate all the governing parameters. The present paper offers a critical review of the investigations reported in the literature on spray-wall impact relevant to IC engines, in an attempt to address the rationale of describing spray-wall interactions based on the knowledge of single droplet impacts.Moreover, although the review was first aimed at fuel-spray impingement in IC engines, it also became relevant to provide a systematization of the current state of the art, which can be useful to the scientific community involved with droplet and spray impingement phenomena.",

     "abstract": "Oxy-fuel combustion is suggested as one of the possible, promising technologies for capturing CO2 from power plants. The concept of oxy-fuel combustion is removal of nitrogen from the oxidizer to carry out the combustion process in oxygen and, in most concepts, recycled flue gas to lower the flame temperature. The flue gas produced thus consists primarily of carbon dioxide and water. Much research on the different aspects of an oxy-fuel power plant has been performed during the last decade. Focus has mainly been on retrofits of existing pulverized-coal-fired power plant units. Green-field plants which provide additional options for improvement of process economics are however likewise investigated. Of particular interest is the change of the combustion process induced by the exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor for nitrogen as diluent. This paper reviews the published knowledge on the oxy-fuel process and focuses particularly on the combustion fundamentals, i.e. flame temperatures and heat transfer, ignition and burnout, emissions, and fly ash characteristics. Knowledge is currently available regarding both an entire oxy-fuel power plant and the combustion fundamentals. However, several questions remain unanswered and more research and pilot plant testing of heat transfer profiles, emission levels, the optimum oxygen excess and inlet oxygen concentration levels, high and low-temperature fire-side corrosion, ash quality, plant operability, and models to predict NOx and SO3 formation is required.",

     "abstract": "The development of diagnostic methods suitable for the monitoring of practical flames is an important objective, which is receiving a growing attention and significant research efforts. This is motivated by the need to achieve a more precise description of the process and, ultimately, implement efficient and reliable control and optimisation methods as a key step towards the development of more efficient, flexible, reliable and clean combustion systems. Many and interesting attempts have been proposed, involving widely different approaches in terms of the instrumentation utilized and the concepts proposed to convert sensorial information into various meaningful parameters. This article intends to review the techniques proposed in the literature for the monitoring of flames, either applied to or conceived for the monitoring of practical combustion equipment. It has been divided into four sections, dealing respectively with optical sensors, imaging techniques, pressure transducers and probing methods. A detailed analysis of the works published reveals that probably the main challenge in this field is the definition of the most representative flame signals and of their subsequent processing to derive the meaningful information required to diagnose the state of a flame or to drive a controller in an effective and safe manner. This together with the wide range of diagnostic needs and restrictions imposed by the different combustion situations probably explains the notable heterogeneity observed among the works published. In spite of the great efforts devoted, the techniques proposed for the advanced monitoring of practical flames are still at a development stage. However, significant advances in this field are expected in a near future, fostered by the urgent demands from the combustion industry and facilitated by the continuous progress in sensor technology, signal processing techniques and, not the least, in the understanding of combustion processes.",

     "abstract": "Polydispersed particles in reactive flows is a wide subject area encompassing a range of dispersed flows with particles, droplets or bubbles that are created, transported and possibly interact within a reactive flow environment - typical examples include soot formation, aerosols, precipitation and spray combustion. One way to treat such problems is to employ as a starting point the Newtonian equations of motion written in a Lagrangian framework for each individual particle and either solve them directly or derive probabilistic equations for the particle positions (in the case of turbulent flow). Another way is inherently statistical and begins by postulating a distribution of particles over the distributed properties, as well as space and time, the transport equation for this distribution being the core of this approach. This transport equation, usually referred to as population balance equation (PBE) or general dynamic equation (GDE), was initially developed and investigated mainly in the context of spatially homogeneous systems. In the recent years, a growth of research activity has seen this approach being applied to a variety of flow problems such as sooting flames and turbulent precipitation, but significant issues regarding its appropriate coupling with CFD pertain, especially in the case of turbulent flow. The objective of this review is to examine this body of research from a unified perspective, the potential and limits of the PBE approach to flow problems, its links with Lagrangian and multi-fluid approaches and the numerical methods employed for its solution. Particular emphasis is given to turbulent flows, where the extension of the PBE approach is met with challenging issues. Finally, applications including reactive precipitation, soot formation, nanoparticle synthesis, sprays, bubbles and coal burning are being reviewed from the PBE perspective. It is shown that population balance methods have been applied to these fields in varying degrees of detail, and future prospects are discussed.",

The most relevant phenomena to be considered in modeling of FB biomass gasifiers are outlined, and the need for further investigation is identified. An updated survey of published mathematical reactor models for biomass and waste gasification in FB is presented. The overall conclusion is that most of the FB biomass gasification models fit reasonably well experiments selected for validation, despite the various formulations and input data. However, there are few measurements available for comparison with detailed model results. Also, validation of models with data from full-scale FB biomass gasification units remains to be done.",

     "abstract": "The control of mercury in the air emissions from coal-fired power plants is an ongoing challenge. The native unburned carbons in fly ash can capture varying amounts of Hg depending upon the temperature and composition of the flue gas at the air pollution control device, with Hg capture increasing with a decrease in temperature; the amount of carbon in the fly ash, with Hg capture increasing with an increase in carbon; and the form of the carbon and the consequent surface area of the carbon, with Hg capture increasing with an increase in surface area. The latter is influenced by the rank of the feed coal, with carbons derived from the combustion of low-rank coals having a greater surface area than carbons from bituminous- and anthracite-rank coals.The chemistry of the feed coal and the resulting composition of the flue gas enhances Hg capture by fly ash carbons. This is particularly evident in the correlation of feed coal Cl content to Hg oxidation to HgCl2, enhancing Hg capture. Acid gases, including HCl and H2SO4 (at small concentrations) and the combination of HC1 and NO2, in the flue gas can enhance the oxidation of Hg.In this presentation, we discuss the transport of Hg through the boiler and pollution-control systems, the mechanisms of Hg oxidation, and the parameters controlling Hg capture by coal-derived fly ash carbons.",

     "abstract": "Alkaline water electrolysis is one of the easiest methods for hydrogen production, offering the advantage of simplicity. The challenges for widespread use of water electrolysis are to reduce energy consumption, cost and maintenance and to increase reliability, durability and safety. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge and technology of hydrogen production by water electrolysis and identifies areas where R&D effort is needed in order to improve this technology. Following an overview of the fundamentals of alkaline water electrolysis, an electrical circuit analogy of resistances in the electrolysis system is introduced. The resistances are classified into three categories, namely the electrical resistances, the reaction resistances and the transport resistances. This is followed by a thorough analysis of each of the resistances, by means of thermodynamics and kinetics, to provide a scientific guidance to minimising the resistance in order to achieve a greater efficiency of alkaline water electrolysis. The thermodynamic analysis defines various electrolysis efficiencies based on theoretical energy input and cell voltage, respectively. These efficiencies are then employed to compare different electrolysis cell designs and to identify the means to overcome the key resistances for efficiency improvement. The kinetic analysis reveals the dependence of reaction resistances on the alkaline concentration, ion transfer, and reaction sites on the electrode surface, the latter is determined by the electrode materials. A quantitative relationship between the cell voltage components and current density is established, which links all the resistances and manifests the importance of reaction resistances and bubble resistances. The important effect of gas bubbles formed on the electrode surface and the need to minimise the ion transport resistance are highlighted. The historical development and continuous improvement in the alkaline water electrolysis technology are examined and different water electrolysis technologies are systematically compared using a set of the practical parameters derived from the thermodynamic and kinetic analyses. In addition to the efficiency improvements, the needs for reduction in equipment and maintenance costs, and improvement in reliability and durability are also established. The future research needs are also discussed from the aspects of electrode materials, electrolyte additives and bubble management, serving as a comprehensive guide for continuous development of the water electrolysis technology.",

     "abstract": "Fly ash, generated during the combustion of coal for energy production, is an industrial by-product which is recognized as an environmental pollutant. Because of the environmental problems presented by the fly ash, considerable research has been undertaken on the subject worldwide. In this paper, the utilization of fly ash in construction, as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of organic compounds, flue gas and metals, light weight aggregate, mine back fill, road sub-base, and zeolite synthesis is discussed. A considerable amount of research has been conducted using fly ash for adsorption of NOx, SOx, organic compounds, and mercury in air, dyes and other organic compounds in waters. It is found that fly ash is a promising adsorbent for the removal of various pollutants. The adsorption capacity of fly ash may be increased after chemical and physical activation. It was also found that fly ash has good potential for use in the construction industry. The conversion of fly ash into zeolites has many applications such as ion exchange, molecular sieves, and adsorbents. Converting fly ash into zeolites not only alleviates the disposal problem but also converts a waste material into a marketable commodity. Investigations also revealed that the unburned carbon component in fly ash plays an important role in its adsorption capacity. Future research in these areas is also discussed.",

     "abstract": "The search for alternatives to petroleum-based fuels has led to the development of fuels from various sources, including renewable feedstocks such as fats and oils. Several types of fuels can be derived from these triacylglycerol-containing feedstocks. One of them is biodiesel, which is defined as the mono-alkyl esters of vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is produced by transesterifying the oil or fat with an alcohol such as methanol under mild conditions in the presence of a base catalyst. Another kind of product that can be obtained from lipid feedstocks is a fuel whose composition simulates that of petroleum-derived diesel fuel. This kind of fuel, probably best termed \u201crenewable diesel\u201d, is produced from the fat or oil by a hydrodeoxygenation reaction at elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalyst. This article discusses in a general and comparative fashion aspects such as fuel production and energy balance, fuel properties, environmental effects including exhaust emissions and co-products. Among the questions that are addressed are if these fuels compete with or complement each other and what the effect of production scale may be.",

     "abstract": "This review attempts to summarize the physical models and advanced methods used in computational studies of gas\u2013liquid two-phase jet flows encountered in atomization and spray processes. In traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) approach, physical modelling of atomization and sprays is an essential part of the two-phase flow computation. In more advanced CFD such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES), physical modelling of atomization and sprays is still inevitable. For multiphase flows, there is no model-free DNS since the interactions between different phases need to be modelled. DNS of multiphase flows based on the one-fluid formalism coupled with interface tracking algorithms seems to be a promising way forward, due to the advantageous lower costs compared with a multi-fluid approach. In LES of gas\u2013liquid two-phase jet flows, subgrid-scale (SGS) models for complex multiphase flows are very immature. There is a lack of well-established SGS models to account for the interactions between the different phases. In this paper, physical modelling of atomization and sprays in the context of CFD is reviewed with modelling assumptions and limitations discussed. In addition, numerical methods used in advanced CFD of atomization and sprays are discussed, including high-order numerical schemes. Other relevant issues of modelling and simulation of atomization and sprays such as nozzle internal flow, dense spray, and multiscale modelling are also briefly reviewed.",

     "abstract": "Probability density function (PDF) methods offer compelling advantages for modeling chemically reacting turbulent flows. In particular, they provide an elegant and effective resolution to the closure problems that arise from averaging or filtering the highly nonlinear chemical source terms, and terms that correspond to other one-point physical processes (e.g., radiative emission) in the instantaneous governing equations. This review is limited to transported PDF methods, where one models and solves an equation that governs the evolution of the one-point, one-time PDF for a set of variables that determines the local thermochemical and/or hydrodynamic state of a reacting system. Progress over the previous 20\u201325 years (roughly since Pope's seminal paper [24]) is covered, with emphasis on developments over the past decade. For clarity and concreteness, two current mainstream approaches are adopted as baselines: composition PDF and velocity\u2013composition PDF methods for low-Mach-number reacting ideal-gas mixtures, with standard closure models for key physical processes (e.g., mixing models), and consistent hybrid Lagrangian particle/Eulerian mesh numerical solution algorithms. Alternative formulations, other flow regimes, additional physics, advanced models, and alternative solution algorithms are introduced and discussed with respect to these baselines. Important developments that are discussed include velocity\u2013composition\u2013frequency PDF's, PDF-based methods as subfilter-scale models for large-eddy simulation (filtered density function methods), PDF-based modeling of thermal radiation heat transfer and turbulence\u2013radiation interactions, PDF-based models for soot and liquid fuel sprays, and Eulerian field methods for solving modeled PDF transport equations. Examples of applications to canonical systems, laboratory-scale flames, and practical combustion devices are provided to emphasize key points. An attempt has been made throughout to strike a balance between rigor and accessibility, between breadth and depth of coverage, and between fundamental physics and practical relevance. It is hoped that this review will contribute to broadening the accessibility of PDF methods and to dispelling misconceptions about PDF methods. Although PDF methods have been applied primarily to reacting ideal-gas mixtures using single-turbulence-scale models, multiple-physics, multiple-scale information is readily incorporated. And while most applications to date have been to laboratory-scale nonpremixed flames, PDF methods can be, and have been, applied to high-Damk\u00f6hler-number systems as well as to low-to-moderate-Damk\u00f6hler-number systems, to premixed systems as well as to nonpremixed and partially premixed systems, and to practical combustion devices as well as to laboratory-scale flames. It is anticipated that PDF-based methods will be adopted even more broadly through the 21st century to address important combustion-related energy and environmental issues.",

     "abstract": "The reversible reaction between CaO and CO2 is an extremely promising method of removing CO2 from the exhaust of a power station, generating a pure stream of CO2 ready for geological sequestration. The technology has attracted a great deal of attention recently, owing to a number of its advantages: the relatively small efficiency penalty which it imposes upon a power station (estimated at 6\u20138 percentage points, including compression of the CO2); its potential use in large-scale circulating fluidised beds (a mature technology, as opposed to the vastly upscaled solvent scrubbing towers which would be required for amine scrubbing); its excellent opportunity for integration with cement manufacture (potentially decarbonising both industries) and its extremely cheap sorbent (crushed limestone).Unfortunately, sorbent (CaO) derived from natural limestone markedly decreases in its reactivity over a number of cycles of reaction with CO2. Much current and promising research involves the investigation of a number of different methods to either reduce the rate of decay in reactivity, to boost the long-term reactivity of the sorbent or to reactivate the sorbent. Technologies investigated include thermal pretreatment or chemical doping of natural sorbents and the production of artificial sorbents. Attrition of the limestone can be a problem during repeated cycling in, e.g. a circulating fluidised bed, and some of the strategies to enhance the long-term capacity of the limestone to take up CO2 can increase attrition. Strategies to counteract attrition, such as pelletisation of highly reactive materials, have succeeded in reducing, though not eliminating, this problem. Each of these topics is reviewed in detail here, as are potential competing reactions with sulphurous compounds and the large-scale integration of the calcium looping cycle with both a power station and a cement works, including a number of assessments of the economics of the cycle.A number of pilot plants demonstrating the technology have been constructed around the world. No major problems have been encountered thus far, and so calcium looping technology is currently moving to the demonstration scale in a number of locations.",

     "abstract": "Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy is widely used for measuring temperature and species concentration in reacting flows. This paper reviews the advances made over the last twelve years in the development and application of CARS spectroscopy in gas-phase reacting flows. The advent of high-power nanosecond (ns) lasers and off-the-shelf compact picosecond (ps) and femtosecond (fs) lasers is enabling the rapid expansion of the application of single-shot or high-bandwidth CARS spectroscopy in a way that would have been quite unimaginable two decades ago. Furthermore, compact ps lasers are paving the way for the development of a fiber-based CARS system for use in harsh environments. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of recent progresses in ns-, ps-, and fs-CARS spectroscopy for gas-phase thermometry and species-concentration measurements since the second edition of A.C. Eckbreth's book entitled Laser Diagnostics for Combustion Temperature and Species, which was published in 1996. During the last two decades, four encompassing issues have driven the fundamental development and application of CARS spectroscopy in reacting flows: 1) measurement of temperature and concentration of multiple species with one CARS system, 2) extension of the application of traditional ns-CARS to challenging reacting flow environments, 3) performance of nonresonant background-free and collision-free measurements in high-pressure reacting flows, and 4) measurement of temperature and species concentration at high bandwidth, typically 1\u00a0kHz or greater, to address the instability and transient phenomena associated with turbulent reacting flows in the combustors and augmentors of modern propulsion systems. This review is focused on identifying and discussing the recent results of gas-phase CARS spectroscopy related to the four issues mentioned above. The feasibility of performing high-bandwidth CARS spectroscopy with one laser beam as well as the potential of tailored fs lasers for thermometry and species-concentration measurements in gas-phase reacting flows are also discussed.",

     "abstract": "Polymers are the most versatile material in our modern day and age. With certain chemicals and additives (pigments, concentrates, anti-blockers, light transformers (LTs), UV-stabilizers, etc.), they become what we know as plastics. The aim of this review is to provide the reader with an in depth analysis regarding the recovery, treatment and recycling routes of plastic solid waste (PSW), as well as the main advantages and disadvantages associated with every route. Recovery and recycling of PSW can be categorized by four main routes, i.e. re-extrusion, mechanical, chemical and energy recovery. Re-extrusion (primary recycling) utilizes scrap plastics by re-introducing the reminder of certain extruded thermoplastics (mainly poly-\u03b1-olefins) into heat cycles within a processing line. When plastic articles are discarded after a number of life cycles, mechanical recycling techniques present themselves as a candidate for utilizing a percentage of the waste as recyclate and/or fillers. Collectively, all technologies that convert polymers to either monomers (monomer recycling) or petrochemicals (feedstock recycling) are referred to as chemical recycling. The technology behind its success is the depolymerization processes (e.g. thermolysis) that can result in a very profitable and sustainable industrial scheme, providing a high product yield and a minimal waste. Nevertheless, due to their high calorific value and embodied energy, plastics are being incinerated solely or in combination with municipal solid waste (MSW) in many developed countries. This review also presents a number of application and technologies currently being used to incinerate plastics. Cement kilns and fluidized beds are the two most common units used to recover energy from PSW or MSW with high PSW content. It is concluded that, tertiary (chemical methods) and quaternary (energy recovery) are robust enough to be investigated and researched in the near future, for they provide a very sustainable solution to the PSW cycle.",
