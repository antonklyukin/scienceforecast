     "abstract": "Macadamia activated carbon (MAC) was impregnated with different concentrations of sulphuric or phosphoric or nitric acid ranging from 20 to 60% v/v and heated in a muffle furnace to improve the structural characteristics of the adsorbents for enhanced Cr(VI) removal. The %S content ranging between 2.27 and 3.23% in H2SO4 treated MAC corroborated the incorporation of sulphonate groups during modification. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy displayed presence of CN, NO, sulphur and phosphorus peaks at 1213, 1531, 1204, and 1214\u202fcm\u22121, respectively, proving efficacious attachment of the functional groups because of acid treatments. The surface area of pristine MAC increased from 545 to 824\u202fm2/g following acid treatment. The optimum performance for the adsorption of Cr(VI) was 98% at pH 1 and 93% at pH 4 after 120\u202fmin of contact time. Compared to pristine carbons (22.3\u202fmg/g), there was an improvement in adsorption capacity to 40.99\u202fmg/g when 20% (v/v) HNO3 activating agent was used, but the adsorption capacity dropped to 9.66\u202fmg/g when 20% (v/v) H2SO4 was used. Materials modified with HNO3 and H3PO4 exhibited superior performances to H2SO4 modified adsorbents indicating the importance of evaluating various concentrations and type of acid as these had positive and negative effects on Cr(VI) removal. The removal mechanism was better explained by both the Langmuir monolayer and Freundlich multilayer isotherms.",

     "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for global energy and the disadvantages related to the use of fossil fuels, mainly due to gas emissions during their combustion, are the main driving forces behind the development of renewable energy sources. In this regard, biodiesel is an interesting alternative, and its use could lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and their release to the atmosphere. In this study, research on heterogeneous catalysis was conducted in order to obtain a CaO catalyst that can be reused in the biodiesel production process. In addition, the transesterification reaction with the use of a heterogeneous catalysis, optimized by full factorial design, was performed. The reaction was conducted in a bench scale re-circulation reactor. The biodiesel obtained was characterized by gas chromatography, to evaluate the ester concentration and physical proprieties, such as density, viscosity and acid concentration. Initially, the best operational conditions were evaluated by data regression using STATISTICA 7.0 \u00ae software. The results were then used to monitor the reaction progress and the catalyst deactivation over time and can verify that the quality of the biodiesel produced is preserved during the experiments. For this, we can conclude that the recycle reactor used in this study give good contribution to innovation in the biodiesel production.",

     "abstract": "Multi-layers filters are usually used in conventional water treatment plants to purify water, reduce turbidity, and remove plankton and undesired odours. Multi-layers filter consists of basic layers represented in graded sand and supporting gravel layers. This research aims to study the efficiency of such filters after the addition of new layers made of copper and zinc particles by 50% per each with high purity, which are traditionally called KDF (Kinetic Degradation Fluxion). The purpose of adding such layers is to increase the efficiency of filters in the removal of diverse chemical contaminants of heavy elements (Lead, Nickel, iron, etc.), and chlorine to use them in traditional or advanced filter stations, such reverse osmosis plants or ion exchange water filters. A glass tube was filled with KDF, sand and gravel layers and used as a multi-layer's filter, and tests were carried out on a water sample that has been prepared in the lab with concentration of 2\u202fmg/l for heavy elements and 5\u202fmg/l for chlorine. Flow rates of the tested water sample were 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100\u202fl/hr. The results show a very high efficiency of such filters to remove of chlorine from the treated water by 90% and more, while the efficiency of the modified filter to remove lead, nickel and iron was 92%, 88%, and 67% respectively; however, there was no significant records in removing the biological contaminants.",

In view of this, this study focused on the use of an eco-friendly natural coagulant, Moringa oleifera seed for the treatment of surface water. In order to obtain lowest turbidity of surface water, optimization of process variable affecting the coagulation of water was carried out using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Four parameters were varied viz. settling time, agitation time, agitation speed and Moringa oleifera seed extract (MOSE) concentration and their effects on the turbidity of the surface water were established. The data obtained was fitted to a quadratic model which was also validated. The model predicted lowest turbidity of 5.49 NTU with optimal condition of 120\u202fmin of settling time, agitation speed of 100\u202frpm, 10\u202fmin of agitation time and 3\u202fg/l of MOSE concentration. The condition was verified in replicates and turbidity of 5.51 NTU was obtained. The result obtained from this study could be applied to industrial scale for treatment of water.",

     "abstract": "The wide use of biotechnology applications in bioprocesses such as the food and beverages industry, pharmaceuticals, and medical diagnostics has led to not only the invention of innovative products but also resulted in consumer and environmental concerns over the safety of biotechnology-derived products. Controlling and monitoring the quality and reliability of biotechnology-derived products is a challenge. Current tracking and tracing systems such as barcode labels and radio frequency identification systems track the location of products from primary manufactures and/or producers throughout globalised distribution channels. However, when it comes to product authentication and tracing, simply knowing the location of the product in the supply chain is not sufficient. DNA hybridisation sensors allows for a holistic approach into product authentication and tracing in that they enable the attribution of active ingredients in biotechnology-derived products to their source. In this article, the state-of-the-art of DNA hybridisation sensors, with a focus on the application of graphene as the backbone, for product authentication and tracing is reviewed. Candidate DNA biocompatible materials, properties and transduction schemes that enable detection of DNA are covered in the discussion. Limitations and challenges of the use of DNA biosensing technologies in real-life environmental, biomedical and industrial fields as opposed to clean-cut laboratory conditions are also enumerated. By considering experimental research versus reality, this article outlines and highlights research needed to overcome commercialisation barriers faced by DNA biosensing technologies. In addition, the content is thought-provoking to facilitate development of cutting edge research activities in the field.",

     "publication date": "01-2019",
     "abstract": "This study investigated the removal of phosphorus from waste phosphogypsum by using citric acid as a leaching reagent, evaluated the potential environmental effect of the final product produced and provide recommendations for the application of developed products. A dissolution process was applied and three variables were studies namely, concentration, stirring speed and temperature. The results showed that Phosphorus can successfully be removed from waste phosphogypsum and the optimum leaching conditions were at the concentration of 0.5\u202fM and temperature of 40\u202f\u00b0C, with no effect observed on varying the stirring speed. Shrinking core model (SCM) was used to determine the best fit for the experimental data. For the pore diffusion model (KD), all correlation coefficients yielded were above 0.9, illustrating a positively linear correlation of KD and leaching behavior for phosphorus. Pore diffusion proved to be the effective rate controlling mechanism for the removal of phosphorus from phosphogypsum. The analysis of moments of particle size distribution (PSD) also showed a reduction in particle size, indicating the dissolution of the solid particles. The application of Toxic Leaching Characteristic Procedure (TLCP) showed low concentrations on the effluent, indicating that the developed product will not contaminate the environment through leaching. The obtained leachate concentrations were within the South African effluent discharge standards. The results also showed that dissolution had a significant contribution on the moments of particle size distribution, in terms of the volume, surface area and particles number. In respect to unconfined compressive strength the products developed can be used for load bearing and as backfill material.",

     "abstract": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as potential green and low-cost substitutes to ionic liquids in various chemical processes. In this study, experimental activity coefficients at infinite dilution for 22 organic solutes were measured in the DES consisting of tetramethylammonium chloride and 1,6 hexanediol (1:1 molar ratio) by gas-liquid chromatography at four temperatures within the range of (313.15\u2013343.15) K at 101.3\u00a0kPa. The effect of the molecular structure of the solute on limiting activity coefficient was also examined. From infinite dilution activity coefficients, limiting partial molar excess enthalpies, entropies and Gibbs free energies were calculated to gain insight into solute-DES interactions. It emerged that the strongest soulte-DES interactions were associated with pyridine, thiophene and methyl acetate. Subsequently, limiting selectivities and capacities were calculated for various separation problems to evaluate the potential use of the DES as a separation agent. The best separation performance of the investigated DES was obtained for mixtures consisting of n-alkanes and thiophene or pyridine. For this reason, it was concluded that the DES (tetramethylammonium chloride\u00a0+\u00a01,6 hexanediol in the 1:1 molar ratio) is a credible candidate to be considered for the denitrogenation as well as the desulphurisation of transportation fuels.",

Addition of the saw dust and the molasses are therefore critical in the production of a high quality coal-saw dust-molasses briquette which does not shatter.",

Evolutionary algorithms are shown to be capable of solving complex reservoir operation models with fast convergence rate. A review of different algorithms in solving different reservoir operation problems is presented. The results generated by these algorithms are effective, competitive, comparable and applicable. The algorithms present the solutions to the computationally expensive models in an efficient way. Systematic ways of solving different reservoir operation models are presented. Many models reviewed involve reservoirs operated in single objective, multiobjectives, single reservoir and multireservoir. Real time operation is shown to be superior to normal operation. The results generated by the evolutionary algorithms presented show that the algorithms are capable of solving complex and multidimensional problem of water resources.

In the past two to three decades, attention has been drawn to organizations such as these reduce their dependence on coal reserves which are depleting and focus on producing clean energy i.e. for every ton of fuel produced, 100\u00a0kg or more should be made from clean energy. This has made torrefaction to gain interest as it improves energy content of biomass, a renewable and clean energy source, to levels equal to and sometimes above that of coal. The benefit of this is that, torrefied biomass could be co-fired with coal thereby reducing greenhouse gases and global warming.In this study, the effect of different parameters were investigated on two abundant sources of biomass in South Africa. There parameters were temperature, oxygen content, heating rate and residence time. It was observed that a temperature range between 275 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C under inert conditions with a heating rate of 10\u00a0\u00b0C/min and residence time between 20 and 40\u00a0min were required to achieve the best biomass with properties comparable to those of coal.

There are different energy changes that occur during its use; however, three types of energy changes were monitored: electrical to acoustical to cavitation, and the efficiency of conversion rate from one form of energy to the other was determined to ascertain the effectiveness of the process. High-power ultrasound do not leave residual chemicals behind after treatment and they reach hidden spots near and/or welds where biofilms thrives. A Nexus hydrophone was used to determine the electrical input energy and the cavitation energy but the calorimetric method was used to determine the acoustical energy. Values obtained for electrical power density were against the rated maximum amplitude displacement to compare the error when using the hydrophone. Results showed that the energy conversion was low, on average 26% from electrical to acoustical energy and 9% from electrical to cavitation. However, the values were in line with some of those reported in literature.

The present experimental results revealed that Cr (VI) is considerably adsorbed on nZVI nanoparticles and it could be a cost-effective method for the in situ remediations of Cr (VI). In addition, standard plate count assay showed the dose-dependent decrease in the bacterial cell viability in lake water sample after the addition of nZVI.",

In the present study sewage wastewater (SWW) and industrial flue gas was supplied in batch and continuous mode for cultivation of microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. Chlorella vulgaris was very effective in reduction of chemical concentrations (COD, NO3\u00af, SO4\u00af, and PO4\u00af) in SWW along with flue gas (CO2, NOx and SOx). COD removal was achieved up to 78% in batch mode and 42% in continuous mode. The other nutrients from the sewage wastewater were removed up to 75% whereas, with continuous mode 55%. Concerning the flue gas treatment studies, Chlorella vulgaris removed CO2 up to 64% in batch mode and when grown in continuous mode it was up to 72%. The SOx and NOx concentrations were reduced up to 62% and 63% respectively in batch mode and the removal efficiencies of the same were 59% and 55% in continuous mode. Both batch and continuous mode showed the maximum biomass productivity in hetero and mixotrophic cultivations. While average biomass productivity in mixotrophic continuous mode was higher as 1.0\u202fg/L. Fourier infrared spectroscopy examination of algal biomass revealed the presence of \u2013OH, \u2013COOH, NH2, and\u202f=\u202fO organic compound groups. It was concluded from the results that C.\u00a0vulgaris was very effective in the treatment of SWW and industrial flue gas on the other hand the biomass obtained is a sustainable green energy source.",

Plasticity tests in a cone penetrometer showed that the faecal sludge has a more liquid than plastic behaviour, which may affect extrusion quality, unless a plasticizer is added, as sawdust in this study.The extent of drying and pasteurization of the samples was determined based on moisture content and the presence of viable Ascaris eggs respectively. As the intensity of infrared radiation was increased, drying was faster and more efficient in terms of energy consumption. However, the pellets were thermally degraded at temperatures above 200\u202f\u00b0C. After processing in the LaDePa, Ascaris eggs were deactivated or severely damaged so that they would be not able to develop.The last part of the study was conducted by determining the content of nutrients (C, N, P, K) and calorific value. The results showed that the processed pellets have suitable characteristics for reuse in agriculture and as a biofuel: similar nutrient content to manure and compost, and similar calorific value to wood. Drying did not affect the nutrient content and calorific value of the dry bone of faecal sludge.",

Analysis of CLWS demonstrated that potassium (K) is the major active component responsible for the activity of the catalyst in CLWS synthesis, and the transesterification of WUO to WUOB in the presence of methanol shows the catalyst to be suitable for biodiesel production from WUO. To model and optimize the process condition, response surface methodology and Artificial Neural Network was employed in the conversion of WUO to WUOB using CLWS as heterogeneous base catalyst. The modeling was carried out by considering three factors, reaction time (RT), catalyst amount (CA) and the ratio of methanol/oil (M/OR). The optimum conditions that achieved 92.45 (%w/w) for RSM and 98.46 (%w/w) for ANN were RT of 40\u202fmin, CA of 6\u202fg and M/OR of 5.5:1.

This paper review about the research in laboratory-scale on TCD, specifically the recent advances like co-feeding effect and regeneration of catalyst for enhancing the productivity of the entire process. Although a remarkable success on the laboratory-scale has been fulfilled, TCD for free greenhouse gas (GHG) hydrogen production is still in its infancy. The necessity for commercialization of TCD is more than ever in the present-day condition of massive GHG emission. TCD generally studied over several types of catalysts, for example mono, bi, trimetallic, combination of metal\u2013metal oxide, carbon and metal doped carbon catalysts. Catalyst Deactivation is the main problem found in TCD process. Regeneration of catalyst and co-feeding of methane with other hydrocarbon are the two main solutions placed helped in accordance to overcome deactivation problem. Higher amount of co-feed hydrocarbon in situ produce more amount of highly active carbon deposits which support further methane decomposition to produce extra hydrogen. The conversion rate of methane increases with increasing temperature and decreases with the flow rate in the co-feeding process in a comparable manner as observed in normal TCD. The presence of co-components in the post-reaction stream is an important challenge attempted in the co-feeding and regeneration.",

Performance coefficient of mechanical vapor compressor ranged between 1.5 and 7.5 depending primarily on the temperature of mother liquor. It was found that with increase in temperature of mother liquor through pre-heating, the power of the compressor, compression ratio and amount of heat supplied to the evaporator decrease. For a 40% concentrated feed solution and mother liquor temperature above 80\u00a0\u00b0C, performance coefficient is higher than 4.

In this study, statistical full factorial design of experiment was explored in the parametric studies of CNTs synthesis via acetylene-chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Bimetallic (FeCo) catalyst supported on CaCO3 was employed for the synthesis of CNTs. The dependence of CNTs yield on the growth time (45/60\u00a0min), growth temperature (700/750\u00a0\u00b0C), acetylene flow rate (150/190\u00a0ml/min), and argon flow rate (230/290\u00a0ml/min) was investigated in the 24 factorial design of experiment. The growth temperature and acetylene flow rate were found to have the most significant effects on the yield of CNTs, and a maximum yield of 170% was obtained at growth conditions of 60\u00a0min, 700\u00a0\u00b0C, 190\u00a0ml/min acetylene flow rate, and 230\u00a0ml/min argon flow rate. Since acetylene undergoes polymerization or dissolution during non-catalyzed thermal decomposition, the significant effects of temperature and acetylene flow rate as illustrated by the factorial analysis suggests that the selective ability of the FeCo/CaCO3 catalyst towards CNTs growth in the thermal decomposition of acetylene in CVD was mainly thermodynamics-controlled. Characterization of CNTs samples synthesized at different conditions shows that highest-yield conditions do not guarantee best quality properties.",

A significant enhancement in surface and bulk properties of milled FA was obtained over fresh FA. The breakage parameters (i.e., the specific rate of breakage and primary breakage distribution function) of FA were determined by the direct experimental method using the narrowly-sized fraction of FA over the short grinding period under identical milling environment. A relatively simple back-calculation method was employed to determine above breakage parameters of FA also using time-variant milling data that were obtained after the grinding of distributed-sized FA feed. The parameters obtained from the direct experimental and back-calculation method yielded comparative milling simulation results with the acceptable accuracy.",

     "abstract": "The need to reduce carbon emissions has encouraged more research into use of biomass energy in place of coal. Biomass is carbon neutral; its use can therefore lower net emissions. Biomass can be upgraded to a fuel similar to coal by torrefaction. Different biomass have been torrefied but there is limited research in possible use of lignocellulose biomass from animal waste. This study aims to compare extent of energy densification of torrefied cow dung, corn cob and pine wood. They were dried, ground and sieved. Proximate and ultimate analysis was conducted. The samples were then torrefied at 200, 250 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C at 10\u00a0\u00b0C/min for 40\u00a0min. The resulting biochar were characterized using mass yield, higher heating value, energy yield and density. Biochar obtained at 250\u00a0\u00b0C were analyzed for elemental composition. Results were compared to Anglo bituminous coal and other torrefied biomass in literature. Corn cob and pine wood reached a maximum of 25.98\u00a0MJ/kg and 20.90\u00a0MJ/kg in heating value respectively whilst cow dung only increased to a maximum of 18.60\u00a0MJ/kg. Increase in heating value for corn cob was attributed to reduction in oxygen due to release of volatiles as well as water. This lowered the O/C ratio thereby densifying the fuel. The O/C and H/C ratio for corncob and wood moved towards that of bituminous coal unlike that of cow dung. Cow dung had a high inorganic composition so its heating value could not be upgraded as much as the other 2 biomass. Its use as a torrefaction raw material was therefore discouraged.",

     "abstract": "Traditional coal-to-liquid (CTL) plants are synonymous with the production of carbon dioxide. Coal may be gasified in the presence of steam and oxygen to produce gas comprising carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2) and steam (H2O). The gases can be reacted to a myriad of chemicals and fuels via the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reaction. However, excess carbon dioxide is generated via the Water-Gas-Shift reaction during preparation of CO:H2 ratios for FT. Here, a process development is represented on a CHO phase diagram, where unique regions are identified for autothermal operations for coal conversion. Considerations are given to develop idealised processes for the production of liquid chemicals from coal which emit minimal process CO2, require minimal energy input and do not require steam. This is achieved by co-feeding coal with methane and identifying endothermic-exothermic process pairs for methane-coal dry reforming. Furthermore, it is shown that a preferred method to produce liquid fuels from coal is by first creating dimethyl ether (DME) as an intermediate, followed by the dehydration of DME to liquid fuels (gasoline range). For this route, via DME, the CO2 emission was found to be four times less than idealised CTL processes.",

The traditional consists in extracting the oil from the paste using boiling water as a solvent. While the mechanical consists of directly pressing the seeds of Jatropha using a ram press called Bielenberg press, to extract the oil contained in the seeds dried or heated before. The net yield of oil extraction by the traditional method was 22.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1%, with a oil cake percentage of 67.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3% and the ratio water/paste in mass adopted was 0.36. Mechanical extraction has an average raw yield of 26.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.74%, with a recovery rate of 74.71%. After decanting for 10 days and filtration, the net yield was 15.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.82% with a decantation and filtration rate of 58.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.24%.

The one produced by mechanical extraction has 0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09% and a density of 0.891.

The cost of the liter of Jatropha oil obtained is higher compared to fossil fuels such as petroleum (500 FCFA per liter) and gas oil (624F CFA per liter).

Essentially, the purpose of the water resources planning process is to balance the available water resources in a system with the water requirements and losses to which the system is subjected. This paper covers a review of generic planning processes and procedures as these apply to complex hydrological systems. Its aim was to improve the balance between water supply and projected requirements which could consist\u00a0of water demand management options and/or infrastructure developments. It was concluded that application of reservoir planning is of great importance, in the fact that the planning processes and procedures described in the manuscript are generic, as it would be impossible to deal with all the intricacies of complex water resources systems. Thus it is concluded that Water Resources Yield Model has an advantage over other models by managing model runs, developing a representative system network, modelling incremental sub-catchments, creating a variety of standard system features, special modelling features, and run result output options.",

     "abstract": "The main source of drinking water in rural areas of South Africa is surface water. Improving drinking water and sanitation facilities alone does not completely solve the problem of waterborne diseases. A novel simple gravity driven filtration unit incorporated with the woven fibre microfiltration (WFMF) membranes was developed for the treatment of raw water for drinking purposes. However, these membranes are susceptible to fouling which reduces flux permeation. This paper focused on evaluating the fouling mitigation strategies to improve on performance of the woven fibre membrane filtration unit with respect to fouling and flux recovery. The study found that the WFMF membrane fouled both internally by pore plugging and externally by adsorption and deposition on the membrane. As a result, a single flux enhancement strategy proved insufficient to maintain high flux successfully. A combination of strategies gave the best optimum conditions for flux production. Backwashing with a combination of brushing yielded the highest recovery of 187%. Soaking the membranes in 0.2% hypochlorite for an hour and thereafter by brushing them yielded 93% flux recovery. Mechanical cleaning however yielded the best result with 97% flux recovery. It was concluded that the selected strategies were the most successful strategies to prevent a sharp decline in flux due to fouling and giving high average flux for the filtration period.",

Photo-induced oxidation profiles were determined to adhere to structural configuration preferential selectivity in favour of smaller sized molecular compounds, where chlordane achieved the least efficiency in removal. The photocatalytic degradation process indicated partial selectivity against chlordane in favour of DDT and TCB, where maximum efficiencies were recorded for the smaller molecular structure compounds, while chlordane recorded significantly lower efficiency of reduction.

However, this process produces dark liquor whose coloring is not desirable in the final food additives. Therefore, a fixed-bed filtration system with activated carbon was used for pigment elimination and clarification of the final product. Color parameters and protein contents were evaluated by comparing the extract and the filtrate. At the same time, an experimental study was conducted that monitored changes in pH and in the adsorption kinetics of proteins on the activated carbon using reactor tanks at various temperatures and residence times. When using a filtration column, the results showed an increase in parameters L*, b* and Hue angle, thereby indicating that the filtrate was closer to the yellow color when compared with the liquor feed. The results obtained using reactor tanks showed that the protein contents and the pH were dependent on the contact time of the substrate with the activated carbon and on the temperature. The experimental time necessary to reach equilibrium was of 15.15\u00a0h for treatments at 30\u00a0\u00b0C, 19.70\u00a0h at 45\u00a0\u00b0C, and 26.06\u00a0h at 60\u00a0\u00b0C.

Adsorption capacities were found to be 3.9 and 8.9\u00a0mg/g at a contact time of 25\u201340\u00a0min and initial metal ion concentration of 300\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcg/g for Pb and Cu, respectively. The biosorption process follows second order kinetics and fitted the Langmuir isotherm model. The result shows that rogers mushroom biomass has a good potential to be used in removal of metal ions and can be used up to three adsorption/desorption cycles without losing efficiency. Its use in real life situation can alleviate pollution and increase the quality of water for human consumption and sanitary purposes.",

Batch studies were performed to evaluate the effects of various experimental parameters such as mixing strength, contact time, internal diffusion, adsorbates and initial concentration on the removal of the BTEX compounds. The equilibrium isotherms for the adsorption of the adsorbates on the PAD 910 polystyrenic resin were analyzed by the Langmuir and linearized Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich models at pH of 5.86. The Langmuir model fitted the data adequately; is concluded that the latter is the most practical model in representing the adsorption of aromatic compounds. The Langmuir model indicated that resin has the highest adsorption capacity of 79.44\u00a0mg/g. At temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C, resin was found to adsorb 98% of benzene, 88% of toluene, 59% of ethylbenzene, 84% m-;p-xylene and 90% o-xylene at an initial concentration of 14.47\u00a0mg/l.

     "abstract": "The thermodynamic features of hydrogen production via chemical looping reforming of waste cooking oil were studied at atmospheric pressure using Gibbs free energy minimization, accounting for the possibility of coke formation. The synthesis gas composition was determined as a function of reforming temperature (400\u20131000\u00a0\u00b0C), steam to carbon ratio (S/C, 1\u201314) and NiO to carbon ratio (NiO/C, 0\u20132). To evaluate the thermodynamically plausible products, the study started with an expanded product set of approximately 30 by-products.The results show that coke formation can be thermodynamically inhibited by increasing the S/C ratio and/or the NiO/C ratio. The conditions that maximize hydrogen production, minimize methane and carbon monoxide content as well as avoid coke formation at thermoneutral conditions were found to be S/C\u00a0=\u00a05, T\u00a0=\u00a0600\u00a0\u00b0C and NiO/C\u00a0=\u00a00.493. Under these conditions, a hydrogen yield of 144.3\u00a0mol/kg of soybean waste cooking oil can be obtained, which appears to be an attractive result for starting experimental research.",

     "abstract": "The issues of acid mine drainage (AMD) from mining activities is not a new phenomenon to the present day developing South Africa as well as in most developed countries around the globe. However, the persistent rise in environmental contamination in South Africa is drastically attracting massive concerns. Vital concerns of AMD in South Africa still remain the threat to soil, surface, subsurface and ground water reserves among others, which consequentially impact human and environmental health. This insistent challenge has given rise to the need for investigating the buffering efficacy of clayey mineral soils for use as natural contaminant barriers to contaminant species from AMD. Therefore, the study presented herein, was channelled towards assessing the chemical alterations in three clayey soils from permeation and interaction with AMD via successive protracted percolation up to 18\u201325 pore volume passage of AMD through the respective soil medium. The final hydraulic conductivity measured, ranged between 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211\u00a0m/s and 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211\u00a0m/s. The obtained pH, electrical conductivity and solute breakthrough curves indicated the soils had low acid-buffering efficacies. Chemical species such as Na, Co and SO 4 2 \u2212 were highly dissolved due to attack on the soil grains by AMD. Chemical species were also released from the soils including the dissolution of metals and desorption of chemical species from AMD attack. As such, the study revealed that the buffering efficacies of the respective tested clayey soils to AMD chemical contaminants were generally ineffective.",

     "publication date": "07-2016",
     "abstract": "Current economic uncertainties and tighter environmental regulations has led industries to consider energy conservation projects more seriously. In this paper, the option of varying the process stream temperature has been suggested as a mean of increasing heat recovery for heat exchanger networks (HEN). Alternatives are generated and assessed using a developed approach. Essentially, the approach involves systematic steps in varying the Hot and/or Cold streams' temperature for each stream in a way that increases the heat recovery approach temperature (HRAT), thus allowing more heat to be recovered. Using the combinatorial method of paths combinations, the adjustment of heat loads for hot and cold utilities from the heat load shifting through the heat exchanger network could be made and assessed accordingly. The changes in temperature made to the streams while exploring each alternative has to be kept within small magnitude i.e., around 1\u20135\u00a0\u00b0C. A user friendly computer program has been developed for performing the approach in view of the significant number of iterations required. An example is used in this paper to demonstrate the application of the developed approach.",
