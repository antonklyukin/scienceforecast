     "abstract": "Mo-99 is the most utilized isotope in nuclear medicine accounting for over 30 million medical diagnostic procedures annually worldwide. The process for the production of Mo-99 through fission of U-235 normally involves the irradiation of UAlx dispersion plate fuel in a research reactor, the subsequent dissolution of the fuel plate, the selective separation of the Mo-99 from all of the other fission products and possibly also the recovery of U-235 for future reuse. Compared to the amount of product recovered, copious radioactive waste is generated during the Mo-99 production process. Gaseous wastes are produced at the head-end during the plate dissolution and several liquid wastes are produced during the recovering of Mo-99 using solid extractants, typically polymeric ion exchange resins, which themselves constitute an additional waste stream. It would be extremely advantageous to devise a new process that generates little or no waste. We have been working on a new strategy for the production of fission Mo-99 that involves replacing the dispersion plate targets that are used in the traditional process with inert or active matrix fuel particles that do not need to be dissolved. In one embodiment of the strategy the preparation of new highly porous ZrCx and graphite-ZrCx composite target kernels are used that are prepared through polymer templating. The surface properties of these porous materials have been studied and are such that they can be easily loaded with uranium, or for that matter, with any other actinide. In our work we are exploring the possibility of selectively extracting the Mo-99 from the irradiated target kernels by either solution or gas-phase methods and then easily recover the uranium. The fission product-containing kernels can be oxidized in air to generate ZrO2 that can act as a stable host material either alone or as part of a multiphase ceramic matrix or possibly even as an actinide transmutation host. At the conceptual level, this Mo-99 production strategy could be applicable to the recycling of actinides within the context of advanced fuel cycles and it could indeed act as a useful test-bed.",

     "abstract": "The Atalante research facility produces radioactive waste that have to be managed according to specific rules. In particular, solid and liquid wastes need to be transferred to another facility in Marcoule to be evaporated with an alpha activity limit of 16.65\u00a0GBq/m3. The radioactive aqueous nitric acid wastes produced in Atalante must be first decontaminated by removing U, Pu and minor actinides and therefore a dedicated decontamination program for radioactive aqueous nitric acid wastes is implemented in Atalante. In particular, the recovery of americium and curium is obtained by extraction chromatography. TEHDGA (N, N, N\u2019, N\u2019-tetra-2-ethylhexyl-3-oxopentane-1,5-diamide), DMDOHEMA ((N,N\u2019-dimethyl-N,N\u2019-dioctylhexyloxyethyl malonamide) and a mixture of both extractants were impregnated on silica gel and studied.Batch experiments were made to determine the performances of such a process. The weight distribution coefficients (Dw) were determined for Am and Nd. Different kinetic behavior was found with both complexants. An effect of nitric acid concentration was observed. For three solids, the americium's uptake increases with acidity. Loading capacities by isotherm and Langmuir isotherm are obtained (between 48mg.g-1 and 94mg.g-1). After determining various parameters in batch extraction experiments, the performances of the solid supports were studied in columns. The breakthrough and elution curves were obtained with neodymium (respectively between 12mg.g-1 and 21mg.g-1; 0.17 and 0.27 L.g-1). Capacity and recovery were optimized with the mixture of DMDOHEMA and TEHDGA.",

     "abstract": "The reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel at Sellafield produces a nitric acid based Highly Active Liquor (HAL) waste. The liquor, containing fission products and process additives, is concentrated in an evaporator in order to reduce the volume and is then stored in Highly Active Storage Tanks (HASTs) prior to vitrification. Caesium phosphomolybdate (CPM) is precipitated during the evaporation process and can convert to zirconium molybdate (ZM) during storage.During Post Operational Clean Out (POCO) of the HASTs, it is expected that their highly active content will be reduced by repeated cycles of washing using nitric acid and other reagents. Initial washings are likely to have a chemical composition comparable to concentrated HAL, becoming more dilute during the wash-out process. It is expected that the wash-out process will also recover significant quantities of molybdate solids (ZM, CPM or a mixture) from the HASTs.In order to determine the processing challenges from such washings during POCO, the physical properties of varying concentrations of non-active HAL simulants containing molybdate solids have recently been measured by the UK's National Nuclear Laboratory.

Subsequently, solvent extraction experiments were carried out to evaluate the stability of the extractants against \u03b3\u2013radiation monitoring Am(III) and Eu(III) distribution ratios. Generally, decreasing distribution ratios with increasing absorbed dose were detected for both molecules. Furthermore, qualitative mass spectrometric analyses were performed and ligand concentrations were determined by HPLC-DAD after irradiation to investigate the radiolysis mechanism. An exponential decrease with increasing absorbed dose was observed for both ligands with a faster rate for CyMe4BTPhen. Main radiolysis products indicated the addition of one or more diluent molecules (1\u2013octanol) to the ligand via prior production of \u03b1-hydroxyoctyl radicals from diluent radiolysis. The addition of nitric acid during the irradiation lead to a remarkable stabilization of the system, as the extraction of Am(III) and Eu(III) did not change significantly over the whole examined dose range. Quantification of the remaining ligand concentration on the other hand showed decreasing concentrations with increasing absorbed dose. The stabilization of D values is therefore explained by the formation of 1\u2013octanol addition products which are also able to extract the studied metal ions.",

TRLFS and extraction studies suggest differences in complexation and extraction behaviour of BTP ligands bearing iso-propyl or n-propyl substituents, respectively. As NMR studies allow insight into the metal-ligand bonding, we conducted NMR studies on a range of 15N-labelled nPrBTP and iPrBTP Ln(III) and Am(III) complexes. Our results show that no strong change in the metal-ligand bonding occurs, thus excluding electronic reasons for differences in complexation behaviour, extraction kinetics and selectivity.

They are simpler than power reactors and operate at lower temperature (cooled to below 100\u00b0C). The fuel assemblies are typically plates or cylinders of uranium alloy and aluminium (U-Al) coated with pure aluminium. These fuels can be processed in AREVA La Hague plant after batch dissolution in concentrated nitric acid and mixing with UOX fuel streams. The aim of this study is to accurately measure the solubility of molybdenum in nitric acid solution containing high concentrations of aluminium. The higher the molybdenum solubility is, the more flexible reprocessing operations are, especially when the spent fuels contain high amounts of molybdenum. To be most representative of the dissolution process, uranium-molybdenum alloy and molybdenum metal powder were dissolved in solutions of aluminium nitrate at the nominal dissolution temperature. The experiments showed complete dissolution of metallic elements after 30minutes stirring, even if molybdenum metal was added in excess. After an induction period, a slow precipitation of molybdic acid occurs for about 15hours. The data obtained show the molybdenum solubility decreases with increasing aluminium concentration. The solubility law follows an exponential relation around 40g/L of aluminium with a high determination coefficient. Molybdenum solubility is not impacted by the presence of gadolinium, or by an increasing concentration of uranium.",

     "abstract": "Solvent based extractions of used nuclear fuel use designer ligands in an organic phase extracting ligand complexed metal ions from an acidic aqueous phase. These extractions will be performed in highly radioactive environments, and the radiation chemistry of all these complexants and their diluents will play a major role in determining extraction efficiency, separation factors, and solvent-recycle longevity. Although there has been considerable effort in investigating ligand damage occurring in acidic water radiolysis conditions, only minimal fundamental kinetic and mechanistic data has been reported for the degradation of extraction ligands in the organic phase. Extraction solvent phases typically use normal alkanes such as dodecane, TPH, and kerosene as diluents. The radiolysis of such diluents produce a mixture of radical cations (R\u2022+), carbon-centered radicals (R\u2022), solvated electrons, and molecular products such as hydrogen. Typically, the radical species will preferentially react with the dissolved oxygen present to produce relatively inert peroxyl radicals. This isolates the alkane radical cation species, R\u2022+ as the major radiolytically-induced organic species that can react with, and degrade, extraction agents in this phase. Here we report on our recent studies of organic radical cation reactions with various ligands. Elucidating these parameters, and combining them with the known acidic aqueous phase chemistry, will allow a full, fundamental, understanding of the impact of radiation on solvent extraction based separation processes to be achieved.",

     "abstract": "The organophosphorus amide octyl(phenyl)-N,N-diisobutylcarbamoylmethyl phosphine oxide (CMPO) is proposed for use in fuel cycle separations as a group actinide/lanthanide extractant. Alternative compounds such as the monoamides and diglycolamides (DGAs) proposed for actinide and/or actinide/lanthanide extraction also contain the amidic functional group, but do not contain the CMPO aromatic or phosphoryl groups. Their radiation stability is in the order monoamides > CMPO > DGA for irradiation under similar conditions. Although they produce similar radiolysis products, the kinetics of degradation for CMPO are completely different than for the other amides. CMPO degradation occurs in a zero-order fashion, and the \u2013G-value for the change in [CMPO] is much lower when in the presence of acid. The DGAs and monoamides degrade with pseudo-first-order kinetics and are not protected by acidity. Possible mechanistic reasons for the differences between CMPO and the other amides are discussed, as are the effects of the diluent and metal complexation on CMPO free radical reaction rates. Finally, it is also shown that \u03b1-irradiation has much less adverse effects on CMPO degradation than \u03b2/\u03b3 irradiation, both with respect to \u2013G-values, and radiolysis product generation.",

     "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE) sponsors research and development on the recycle of used commercial nuclear fuel as an option for future nuclear fuel cycles that offers increased use of uranium and thorium resources and a possible reduction in the overall cost of nuclear waste management. The two alternatives, direct disposal of used fuel and fuel recycle, are broadly referred to as open and closed fuel cycles. One requirement of a closed fuel cycle is the safe management of radioactive off-gases, which includes 14C, radioiodine and the noble gases, including radioxenon. The longest lived relevant radioxenon isotope is 127Xe; with a half-life of just 36.35 days it is feasible to trap and hold the radioxenon to allow for decay to safe environmental levels. However, the very weak chemical bonds of noble gases, in this case xenon, make them difficult to trap, which led to an extensive DOE-NE study of noble gas adsorption on various molecular sieves as an alternative to costly cryogenics processes. Preliminary results indicate that xenon adsorption at near room temperature on molecular sieves, both synthetic and natural, may have both cost and efficiency advantages over cryogenic processes.Xenon radioisotopes with short half-lives have value in the detection of underground nuclear explosions. However radioxenon released by medical isotope production facilities produces high backgrounds that complicate its use for nuclear explosion detection. Specifically, recovery of 99Mo for medical applications from short-cooled irradiated 235U targets results in the release of some radioxenon. In March 2015, by a unanimous vote of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, commercial producers of 99Mo were asked to decrease and, if possible, eliminate the emissions of radioactive xenon from their production processes. The use of materials currently being evaluated for Xe and Kr capture for use in UNF processing applications may provide a cost effective mechanism to achieve the United Nations Security Council goal.",

After the hypothetical accident assuming the loss of all electric power and cooling functions, high-level liquid waste (HLLW) may be overheated by the energetic decays of many fission products in it, and Ru may be oxidized to the volatile tetroxide, RuO4, which is released through the off-gas pathway. At a reprocessing plant in Japan, alkaline solution from the solvent scrubbing stream is sometimes mixed with the HLLW followed by vitrification, which can be influenced by the addition of sodium nitrate to a simulated HLLW containing ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate that was experimentally evaluated on a small scale using the overheated nitric acid solution of 2mol dm\u22123, which was kept at 180\u00b0C in a glass evaporator placed in a thermostatic bath. The release fraction of Ru increased by approximately 30% by the addition of sodium nitrate.

Since 2008, a liquid-liquid extraction process called EXAm has been developed by the CEA to allow the recovery of Am alone from a PUREX raffinate (a dissolution solution already cleared from U, Np and Pu). A mixture of DMDOHEMA (N,N\u2019-dimethyl-N,N\u2019-dioctyl-2-(2-(hexyloxy)ethyl)-malonamide) and HDEHP (di-2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid) in TPH is used as the solvent and the Am/Cm selectivity is improved using TEDGA (N,N,N\u2019,N\u2019-tetraethyldiglycolamide) as a selective complexing agent to maintain Cm and heavier lanthanides in the acidic aqueous phase (5\u00a0M HNO3). Americium is then stripped selectively from light lanthanides at low acidity (pH=3) with a polyaminocarboxylic acid. The feasibility of sole Am recovery was already demonstrated during hot tests in ATALANTE facility and the EXAm process was adapted to a concentrated raffinate to optimize the process compactness. The speciation of TEDGA complexes formed in the aqueous phase with Am, Cm and lanthanides was studied to better understand and model the behavior of TEDGA in the process. Some Ln-TEDGA species are extracted into the organic phase and this specific chemistry might play a role in the Am/Cm selectivity improvement. Hence the hydrophilicity-lipophilicity balance of the complexing agent is an important parameter. In this comprehensive study, new analogues of TEDGA were synthesized and tested in the EXAm process conditions to understand the relationship between their structure and selectivity. New derivatives of TEDGA with different N-alkyl chain lengths and ramifications were synthesized. The impact of lipophilicity on ligand partitioning and Am/Cm selectivity was investigated.",

However, production of 238Pu requires specialist facilities including a nuclear reactor, a source of 237Np for target irradiation and hotcells to chemically separate neptunium and plutonium within the irradiated targets. These specialist facilities are expensive to build and operate, so naturally, a more economical alternative is attractive to the space industry. Within Europe 241Am is considered a promising alternative heat source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and radioisotope heating units (RHUs) since, as a daughter product of 241Pu decay, 241Am exists in 1000 kgs quantities within the UK civil plutonium stockpile. A chemical separation process is required to extract the 241Am in a pure form and this paper describes the AMPPEX process (Americium and Plutonium Purification by Extraction), successfully developed over the past five years to isolate 241Am in high yield (> 99%) and to a high purity (> 99%). The process starts by dissolving plutonium dioxide in nitric acid with the aid of a silver(II) catalyst, which is generated electrochemically. The solution is then conditioned and fed to a PUREX type solvent extraction process, where the plutonium is separated from the americium and silver. The plutonium is converted back to plutonium dioxide and the americium is fed forward to a second solvent extraction step. Here the americium is selectively extracted leaving the silver in the aqueous phase. The americium is stripped from the solvent and recovered from solution as americium oxalate, which is calcined to give americium dioxide as the final product. This paper describes the development of the AMPPEX process over a series of six solvent extraction separation trials using centrifugal contactors. The technical underpinning reported here has allowed the design of a facility capable of producing 25-50 g of americium per day.",

We have focused on two monoamides: N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl)-2,2-dimethylpropanamide (DEHDMPA) and N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl)butanamide (DEHBA), and proposed a multistage extraction process for recovering U and Pu by these monoamides. A continuous counter-current experiment was carried out to demonstrate the validity of this process. This process consisted of two cycles, and the 1st cycle and the 2nd cycle employed DEHDMPA and DEHBA as extractants, respectively. The feed solution for the 1st cycle was 5.1\u00a0mol/dm3 (M) nitric acid containing 0.92\u00a0M U, 1.6\u00a0mM Pu, and 0.6\u00a0mM Np. The raffinate collected in the 1st cycle was used as the feed for the 2nd cycle. The ratios of U recovered in the U fraction and U-Pu fraction were 99.1% and 0.8%, respectively, and the ratios of U in the used solvents were <0.04%. The ratio of Pu recovered in the U-Pu fraction was 99.7%, and the ratio of Pu in the used solvents was in the order of 10\u20133\u201310\u20134%. The concentration ratio of U with respect to Pu in the U-Pu fraction was 9, and this indicated that Pu was not isolated.

     "abstract": "Recycling americium alone from the spent fuel is an important issue currently studied for the future nuclear cycle (Generation IV systems) as Am is one of the main contributors to the long-term radiotoxicity and heat power of final waste. The solvent extraction process called EXAm has been developed by the CEA to enable the recovery of Am alone from a PUREX raffinate (with U, Np and Pu already removed). A mixture of DMDOHEMA and HDEHP diluted in TPH is used as the solvent and the Am/Cm selectivity is improved using TEDGA as a selective complexing agent to maintain Cm and the heavier lanthanides in the acidic aqueous phase (HNO3 5-6\u00a0M). Americium is then selectively stripped from the light lanthanides at low acidity (pH 2.5-3) with a polyaminocarboxylic acid (DTPA). An additional step is necessary before Am recovery, in order to strip molybdenum which would otherwise be complexed by DTPA and contaminate the Am raffinate. In order to make the process and its associated future plant more compact, the objective is now to adapt the EXAm process to a concentrated raffinate.With a concentrated PUREX raffinate, the process operates under conditions close to saturation both for the solvent and complexing agent TEDGA during the Am extraction step. Consequently, some changes were needed to adapt the flowsheet to higher concentrations of cations.Before the test on a real PUREX raffinate in the CBP shielded line at ATALANTE (at the end of 2015), the EXAm flowsheet had to be consolidated and achievable target performances ensured. A series of experiments and tests was performed: on laboratory scale (batch experiments), to identify the good operating conditions and to simulate the main phenomena involved (2010-2014); first on an inactive surrogate feed solution at G1 facility (2011 \u2013 2013), and then on a surrogate feed solution with trace amounts of americium and curium (spiked test) in the C17 shielded line at ATALANTE (2014).",

This process thus appears as an attractive alternative to conventional processes for the synthesis of high-value precipitates; as it offers interesting intensification capabilities.In this context, the feasibility of the precipitation of bismuth subnitrate (BSN), for which the emulsion route for precipitation seems to be particularly attractive, has been studied. Indeed, the division of the reacting volume into droplets may allow efficient temperature regulation of the exothermic reaction. In addition, an improvement of the product appearance is expected.This first phase of the feasibility study focused on the choice of the organic phase and the sensitivity of the droplets and solid particles properties to the operating conditions.

The separation of americium alone from a PUREX raffinate can be achieved by co-extracting lanthanide (Ln(III)) and actinide (An(III)) cations into an organic phase containing the diglycolamide extractant TODGA, and then stripping Am(III) with selectivity towards Cm(III) and lanthanides. The water soluble ligand H4TPAEN was tested to selectively strip Am from a loaded organic phase.Based on experimental data obtained by J\u00fclich, NNL and CEA laboratories since 2013, a phenomenological model has been developed to simulate the behavior of americium, curium and lanthanides during their extraction by TODGA and their complexation by H4TPAEN (complex stoichiometry, extraction and complexation constants, kinetics). The model was gradually implemented in the PAREX code and helped to narrow down the best operating conditions. Thus, the following modifications of initial operating conditions were proposed: \u2022 An increase in the concentration of TPAEN as much as the solubility limit allows. \u2022 An improvement of the lanthanide scrubbing from the americium flow by adding nitrates to the aqueous phase.A qualification of the model was begun by comparing on the one hand constants determined with the model to those measured experimentally, and on the other hand, simulation results and experimental data on new independent batch experiments.A first sensitivity analysis identified which parameter has the most dominant effect on the process. A flowsheet was proposed for a spiked test in centrifugal contactors performed with a simulated PUREX raffinate with trace amounts of Am and Cm. If the feasibility of the process is confirmed, the results of this test will be used to consolidate the model and to design a flowsheet for a test on a genuine PUREX raffinate.

Therefore, an aerosol-generation based process was established at Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich for the production of spherical, mono-disperse uranium oxide micro-particles with accurately characterized isotopic compositions and amounts of uranium in the picogram range. The synthesized particles are studied with respect to their suitability as (certified) reference material in ultra-trace analysis. Several options for preparation and stabilization of the particles are available, where preparation of particles in suspension offers the possibility to produces specific particle mixtures. In order to assess the stability of particles, dissolution behavior and isotope exchange effects of particles in liquid suspension is studied on the bulk of suspended particles and also via micro-analytical methods applied for single particle characterization. The insights gained within these studies will form the basis on the choice of the further route towards preparation of uranium particle reference standard and certification as a reference material.",

     "abstract": "The treatment of off-gas streams arising from reprocessing of used nuclear fuel (UNF) is an area of active study by the U.S. Department of Energy. Such off-gas streams contain volatile fission products, including long-lived 129I. Although 129I is released into the off-gas at multiple points within the chemical reprocessing flowsheet, previous research has focused on removal from the dissolver off-gas stream (DOG). The DOG is expected to contain up to 98% of iodine in UNF at ppm levels within the stream. Other off-gas streams will also contain iodine but at substantially lower concentrations. Recent work has shown that compliance with U.S. regulations will likely require capture of iodine from these dilute streams in addition to capture from DOG.In particular, the vessel off-gas (VOG) stream is expected to contain 1-3% of the total iodine inventory at ppb concentrations. A review of literature also indicates that the speciation of iodine in the VOG stream will differ from that of the DOG, with the DOG containing primarily I2 and the VOG containing a mixture of I2 and organic iodine species.Silver-exchanged mordenite (AgZ) has been identified for use in the removal of iodine from off-gas streams. It is an effective capture material for I2 at the concentrations expected in the DOG, but little is known about its performance in gas streams that may contain both I2 and organic iodides at very dilute concentrations.The experiments to be described were designed to separately characterize the adsorption of I2 and methyl iodide on AgZ through extended duration testing. Simulated vessel off-gases containing low levels of either I2 or methyl iodide were contacted with AgZ sorbent beds for up to four months. Through the use of sorbent beds in series and varied sampling times, key parameters such as adsorption rate, decontamination factor, and performance over time could be determined for the capture of each species by AgZ.This paper will discuss the literature relating to the speciation of iodine in the VOG and will discuss the results of adsorption experiments. An examination of the difference between capture of I2 and organic iodides will be conducted, and the impacts of those results on future iodine removal work will be considered.",

The method of classes, also called discretized population balance, used in this study is based on the method of Litster. Whereas, the Quadrature Method of Moment (QMOM) is written in terms of the transport equations of the moments of the number density function. All the integrals are solved through a quadrature approximation thanks to the product-difference algorithm or the Chebyshev algorithm. Primary nucleation, crystal growth and agglomeration are taken into account. Agglomeration phenomena have been found to be represented by a loose agglomerates model. Thermodynamic effects are modeled by activity coefficients which are calculated using the Bromley model.

     "abstract": "Spent fuel cladding which is highly activated and strongly contaminated is expected to be disposed of in an underground repository. A typical activation product in the activated metal waste is carbon 14 (14C), which is mainly generated by the 14N(n,p)14C reaction and produces a significant exposure dose due to the large inventory, long half-life (5730 years), rapid release rate, and the speciation and consequent migration parameters. In the preliminary Japanese safety case, the release of radionuclides from the metal matrix is regarded as the corrosion-related congruent release, and the cladding oxide layer is regarded as a source of instant release fraction (IRF).In the present work, specific activity of 14C was measured using an irradiated BWR fuel cladding (Zircaloy-2, average rod burnup of 41.6 GWd/tU) which has an external oxide film having a thickness of 25.3 \u03bcm. The 14C specific activity of the base metal was 1.49\u00d7104 Bq/g, which in the corresponding burnup is comparable to values in the existing literature, which were obtained from various irradiated claddings. Although the specific activity in oxide was 2.8 times the base metal activity due to the additive generation by the 17O(n,\u03b1)14C reaction, the 14C abundance in oxide was less than 10% of total inventory. A static leaching test using the cladding tube was carried out in an air-tight vessel filled with a deoxygenated dilute NaOH solution (pH of 12.5) at room temperature. After 6.5 years, 14C was found in each leachate fraction of gas phase and dissolved organics and inorganics, the total of which was less than 0.01% of the 14C inventory of the immersed cladding tube. A simple calculation based on the congruent release with Zircaloy corrosion has suggested that the 96.7% of released 14C was from the external oxide layer and 3.3% was from the base Zircaloy metal. However, both the 14C abundance and the low leaching rate suggests that 14C in oxide does not have a significant impact on the IRF in the safety case.",

     "abstract": "Many advanced reprocessing schemes under development are aimed at co-processing and co-conversion of actinides, unlike current reprocessing plants that produce separate uranium and plutonium products. The most well developed option for the co-conversion stage is probably oxalate co-precipitation, followed by the thermal co-conversion to a mixed oxide product. It is thus envisaged that future processes will avoid separation of plutonium from uranium and instead allow part of the uranium to flow with the plutonium, resulting in co-precipitation as the oxalate, and finally co-conversion to a mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX), which can be fabricated into recycled nuclear fuel for further energy generation.The co-crystallisation of uranium (IV) and plutonium (III) into a single oxalate structure ensures the homogenous distribution of the two actinides at the molecular scale. The joint conversion of uranium and plutonium to the oxide form makes it possible to remove the complicated step of blending and grinding the two distinct oxide powders, as currently employed for the purposes of MOX fuel fabrication. This concept can also be extended to other actinides, including minor actinides from partitioning processes such as SANEX (Selective Actinide Extraction) and GANEX (Grouped Actinide Extraction) processes or even a thorium containing product from recycle of thorium based fuels.A selection of UxTh1-x(C2O4)2 solids at varying concentrations of uranium and thorium were prepared by oxalate co-precipitation. Uranium (VI) was conditioned electrochemically at -0.7 V to uranium (IV), in the presence of hydrazine. The reduced uranium (IV) in nitric acid was mixed with thorium nitrate solutions at different concentration ratios with oxalic acid. The mixed tetravalent uranium-thorium oxalate solid products have been characterised by Raman and IR spectroscopies. The influence of thorium substituted into the uranium oxalate structure was evaluated. Several vibrational modes were found to be affected by the variation in ionic radius appearing to be metal sensitive and therefore, provide the initial indication in the evaluation of the chemical composition.",

Understanding the different steps of densification during CRMP pellet sintering thus appears as fundamental to obtain final materials with the specific features required for AmBB. The densification curve recorded in dynamic conditions shows different sintering steps. A first decrease of shrinkage rate happens at low temperature, around 1100 K. This phenomenon is not normally observed in the sintering of conventional powders. Chemical and microstructural studies were performed on (U,Am)O2 and also on (Ce,Gd)O2 surrogate compound to highlight the causes of this low-temperature sintering step. Multiscale reorganization finally appears as the sole explanation, through the sintering of nanometric aggregate present in the green pellet and related to the morphology of the starting microspheres employed as pelletization precursors.",

     "abstract": "Partitioning and transmutation (P&T) technologies have been developed for minor actinides (MA) to reduce the high level waste (HLW) volume and long-term radiotoxicity. Although the MA P&T can reduce the potential radiotoxicity effectively by 1-3 orders of magnitude, the actual operation of P&T requires several tens of years for developing elemental technologies of nuclide separation, MA containing fuel fabrication, transmutation and their practical systematization. The high level liquid waste (HLLW) containing MA is presently vitrified immediately after spent fuel reprocessing, stored about 50 years at surface facility and will be disposed of at deep geological repository. Vitrified HLW form works as an excellent artificial barrier against nuclides release during storage and disposal. On the other hand, it is difficult to recover MA from the form. So the present waste management scheme has an issue of MA P&T technology application until its deployment, which will produce much amount of vitrified HLW including long-lived MA without P&T application. Thus the authors proposed the flexible waste management method to increase the effectiveness of the MA P&T. The system adopts the HLLW calcination instead of the vitrification to produce granule for its dry storage of about 50 years until the MA P&T technology will be applicable. The granule should be easily dissolved by the nitric acid solution to apply the typical aqueous MA partitioning technologies to be developed. This paper reports the purpose of the study, the feasibility evaluation results for the calcined granule storage and the evaluation results for the environmental burden reduction effect.",

During MOX fuel production, residues unsuitable for further recycle will be produced. Due to their high actinide content MOX residues require immobilization within a robust host matrix. Although it is possible to immobilize actinides in vitreous wasteforms; ceramic phases, such as brannerite (UTi2O6), are attractive due to their high waste loading capacity and relative insolubility. A range of uranium brannerites, formulated GdxU1-xTi2O6, were prepared using a mixed oxide route. Charge compensation of divalent and trivalent cations was expected to occur via the oxidation of U4+ to higher valence states (U5+ or U6+). Gd3+ was added to act as a neutron absorber in the final Pu bearing wasteform. X-ray powder diffraction of synthesised specimens found that phase distribution was strongly affected by processing atmosphere (air or Ar). In all cases prototypical brannerite was formed accompanied by different secondary phases dependent on processing atmosphere. Microstructural analysis (SEM) of the sintered samples confirmed the results of the X-ray powder diffraction.

Within the frame of the two French acts on radioactive waste management, a pyrochemical R&D program was launched at the CEA Marcoule in the late 90's. The second step is the actinides back-extraction, which consists in a liquid/liquid oxidative stripping of the An from aluminium matrix into molten chloride media. The DOS process has been successfully demonstrated for treatment of oxide type fuels within the last years: the core of the process has been already assessed and the studies have shown high selectivity and a quantitative recovery of actinides.Within the framework of the SACSESS European research program, the pyrochemical activities focused on applications of the DOS process to reprocess CERCER transmutation targets. These particular type of fuels consist of a mixture of minor actinides (MA) oxides diluted in an inert (oxide MgO) matrices. The behaviour of matrices material was first investigated regarding the solubility in the fluoride salt, starting from both oxide powders or sintered pellets. Further investigations focused on the reductive extraction behaviour of Mg in metallic Al. The impact of Mg on the efficiency of An reductive extraction was also studied using uranium simulating the behaviour of MA oxides.",

Besides the design of industrial contactors relevant for the nuclear industry, and the scale-reduction of the demonstrators required for R&D studies, the fluid mechanics studies are also helpful in determining the adjustable parameters of the process simulator which predicts the separation performances (PAREX code).In this contribution, the methodology based on a multiscale approach, and heavily relying on optical measurement techniques is first introduced.

Indeed, most of the steps of the PUREX\u00ae process involve multiphasic flows (dissolution, leaching, liquid-liquid extraction, precipitation, filtration, etc.). Therefore an accurate knowledge of the dispersed phase properties is required in order to assess their coupling with the flow features, to predict the process performance and efficiency and to achieve size reduction or extrapolation.Hence, the measurements of particulate flows properties, and especially the particles (or drops or bubbles) size distribution, concentration (i.e. hold-up) and velocity has become a growing issue. Relevant techniques for measuring these flow properties are multiple, from the high-speed video acquisition coupled to image processing to the laser-induced fluorescence, including the particle imaging velocimetry or interferometric techniques (digital in-line holography, rainbow refractometry, etc.). In this communication, different techniques developed at CEA Marcoule for the characterization of multiphase flows, will be introduced.

Solvent extraction reprocessing methods that have been developed contain various steps tailored to the separation of specific radionuclides, which are highly dependent upon solution properties. The instrumentation used to monitor these processes must be robust, require little or no maintenance, and be able to withstand harsh environments such as high radiation fields and aggressive chemical matrices.Our group has been investigating the use of optical spectroscopy for the on-line monitoring of actinides, lanthanides, and acid strength within fuel reprocessing streams. This paper will focus on the development and application of a new MicroRaman probe for on-line real-time monitoring of the U(VI)/nitrate ion/nitric acid in solutions relevant to used nuclear fuel reprocessing. Previous research has successfully demonstrated the applicability on the macroscopic scale, using sample probes requiring larger solution volumes. In an effort to minimize waste and reduce dose to personnel, we have modified this technique to allow measurement at the microfluidic scale using a Raman microprobe. Under the current sampling environment, Raman samples typically require upwards of 10\u00a0mL and larger. Using the new sampling system, we can sample volumes at 10\u00a0\u03bcL or less, which is a scale reduction of over 1,000 fold in sample size.This paper will summarize our current work in this area including: comparisons between the macroscopic and microscopic probes for detection limits, optimized channel focusing, and application in a flow cell with varying levels of HNO3, and UO2(NO3)2.",

In this case chemiluminescence of chemiluminogen (luminol) arises when the ion of f element is excited by multi-quantum absorption of visible light.

     "abstract": "Nitric acid plays an integral role in the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. It is well known that nitric acid degrades; its often yellow hue signifies the presence of decomposition products. The decomposition of nitric acid is accelerated by temperature and radiolysis; therefore it is an important consideration in the reprocessing of nuclear fuels.Thermal and radiolytic reactions of nitric acid result in the formation of redox active nitrogen species, of which nitrous acid is of particular concern, largely due to its redox reactions with plutonium and neptunium. Such reactions are important to understand as plutonium and neptunium can exist in a number of oxidation states; the oxidation state has a direct effect on the species extractability. The effect of nitrous acid is exacerbated as it catalyzes its own production and its reactions with actinides are typically autocatalytic; thus even micromolar quantities can have a large effect. A full understanding of solvent extraction requires us to understand actinide valence states which in turn require us to understand what nitrogen species are present and their concentrations.As a first step in the overall objective of enhancing process models, the kinetic data for nitric acid decomposition reactions has been investigated in order to produce an initial dynamic model of decomposition under aqueous conditions. The identification of a set of kinetic reactions suitable for modelling has been the primary focus of this work. A model of nitric acid thermal decomposition will help develop a better understanding of nitric acid decomposition chemistry and enable better prediction of the oxidation states of species in solution. It is intended to later extend the model to include radiolytic reactions and then further to incorporate an organic phase in order to have a model which covers all decomposition routes for nitric acid within a nuclear fuel reprocessing scheme. The model will be used as a sub model for process models relating to nuclear fuel reprocessing to allow the nitric acid decomposition to be included and the effect of this on operations to be predicted. This is particularly relevant for models of maloperations where different fault scenarios can be investigated and the results of these predicted, as for example unusually high acidity could increase the yields of redox active species significantly altering actinide oxidation states.",

However, the political uncertainty in many countries about the future of nuclear energy source clearly illustrates that there is a need for a global approach to compare nuclear energy with other energy sources and draw its potential future improvements. Indeed, beyond the well-known economic aspect, many other criteria are also implicitly considered when choosing a relevant energy mix to be implemented in a given country. This rather recent situation requires extending the classical approach based on the technological and economic optimization to a wider approach also including the overall environmental footprint and the more general social acceptance. Sustainability approach includes the different criteria describing the environmental, economic and societal fields. Therefore, it may be relevant to identify the current key figures of nuclear energy, and help to identify the most promising improvement directions.

The correlation coefficients of these models are 0.9989, 0.9955 and 0.9976 within the range from 0.1mM to 6mM. Meanwhile, a strong correlation is obtained between the three models (Each R2>0.986) with regression analysis. At last, 20 urine samples are tested and an analysis of the correlation between the results measured by the proposed method and by the capillary electrophoresis method is made.

They can be obtained from various Aquilaria species such as A. malaccensis, A. hirta and A. crassna. This viscous oil is called as pure agarwood essential oil (100% of extracted material). Commonly, the oils are releasing long-lasting woody, warm and smoky scent due to slow release when applied to the skin. The blending of a small amount of this precious agarwood oil with other essential oils such as geranium, sandalwood, gurjum balsam, jasmine and Ylang ylang can give rich, complex and pleasant oils. Agarwood oil acts as a base note to fix the perfume odour comprising of middle and top notes. Currently, there is no scientific technique used to differentiate pure and mixture agarwood oils and usually, it is based on the different results and inconsistency from traders and buyers agreement. Thus, as part of our work on the authentication of agarwood oils from Malaysia, we propose a method to discriminate pure and mix agarwood oils via electronic nose (E-Nose) coupled with k-NN kfold classifier with accuracy percentage improvement from 90% to 100% accuracy compared to the standard manufacturer statistical tool Discriminant Factorial Analysis (DFA).",

     "abstract": "Magnetron sputtering deposition is a widely used technique to deposit thin film precisely at nanoscale level. During the deposition of metal oxide thin films, reactive oxygen gas is introduced into the deposition chamber. Pure metal and metal oxide materials can be used as sputter target, although the simplest way is by using a pure metal target. In such reactive process, the effect of target poisoning significantly influence the deposition process and the growth mechanisms of metal oxide thin films became very complex. In general, external parameters such as discharge power, working pressure, reactive gases ratio and substrate temperature are used to optimize the properties of deposited thin films. Then, ex-situ analyses such as scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction analysis are performed to obtain the optimized parameter. Sample depositions and ex-situ analyses consume time to achieve the goal through try and error. In this article, in-situ plasma diagnostics are reviewed focusing on an optical emission spectroscopy to precisely control and investigate the sputter target poisoning effect during the deposition of metal oxide thin films. The emission of atomic lines from several metal and oxygen atoms were used to discuss the deposition mechanisms and their correlation with the deposited thin films was observed. Finally, the deposited metal oxide thin films were proposed and tested for several applications such as gas sensor and frequency selective surface glass.",

Microdialysis requires a (microdialysis) probe to be inserted to the designated area of study. Separation procedure is completed by using a selective semi-permeable membrane attached to the microdialysis proe. Despite being a well-established technique, there are still issues regarding the performance of the microdialysis probe. The biggest issue is arguably that the concentration of solutes collected via microdialysis sampling represents only 20-30% of the original concentration from the sampling site. This issue can be resolved by understanding mass transport phenomena within the microdialysis probe and its surroundings. One straightforward, yet sustainable way to analyze mass transport is through the use of computational modelling. In this paper, a mathematical framework, representing glucose recovery from a quiescent media using a microdialysis probe of linear design was described. Governing equations, boundary conditions and operational parameters were justifiably selected. Different diffusion coefficients were used to describe the mass transport through the quiescent media, semi-permeable membrane and the probe's lumen. Subsequently, the influence of some identified parameters, on the overall recovery is examined. Scanning electron microscopy imaging was used to study the physical characteristics of the microdialysis membrane, thus being utilized to estimate the diffusion coefficient values. The impact of using different diffusion coefficient values on the overall recovery was also discussed.",

As the optimal pore size is dependent on the specifics of the biomaterial or tissue engineering application, the ability to alter the pore size over a wide range is necessary for several scaffolds in order to meets the requirements of the applications. The aim of this study is to develop methodologies to produce calcium phosphate scaffolds with acceptable pore size and defined pore-channel interconnectivity. The pore size of calcium phosphate scaffolds is established during the freeze-drying fabrication process. In this process, material suspension is simply frozen and then dried by freeze-drier, which able to produce material with unique porous architectures, where the porosity is almost a direct replica of the frozen solvent crystals. There are two different method of freeze-casting carried out in order to study the effect of freezing temperature by which in the first method; sample being soaked with liquid nitrogen (-196\u00a0\u00b0C) for about 10\u00a0minutes before been place inside a freezer (-40\u00a0\u00b0C). In the second method, the sample was directly placed inside a freezer for casting at temperature of -40 \u030aC. The results show that the pore size of the scaffolds decreased as the freezing temperature was reduced. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the methodologies applied in this study can be used to produce a range of calcium phosphate scaffolds exhibiting better compressive strength, approximately 665-875 KPa for 54-64.3% of porosity with mean pore size from 102-113\u00a0\u03bcm. The methods developed in this study provide a basis for the investigation on the effects of different freezing temperature in freeze-casting process on the porosity, morphology, and compressive properties of the calcium phosphate scaffolds.",

The analysis of the contour plots for thickness revealed that high thickness (>40\u00a0\u03bcm) was obtained when standoff distance is at 20-25\u00a0mm, surface roughness at 240-700 grit and substrate heating temperature at 350-550\u00a0\u00b0C.

     "abstract": "Combustion of the rice husk produces rice husk ash, which consists of mainly silica. High purity silica can be produced by controlled combustion after acid treatment. In this study, leaching of rice husk with hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid were carried out prior to combustion to obtain purer silica. It was found that pre-treatment of the rice husk with sulfuric acid had accelerated the hydrolysis and decomposition of organic components as revealed by thermogravimetry (TG) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses. In a systematic study, the combustion of un-leached, hydrochloric acid-leached and sulfuric acid-leached rice husks were performed in a muffle furnace at 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900oC for 2\u00a0h. Results demonstrated that all the samples produced amorphous silica (SiO2) and the average particle size were in the range of 0.50 to 0.70\u00a0\u03bcm. The effect of combustion at different temperatures between 500oC and 900oC on the silica production is very small, particularly at temperature above 600oC. Thus, amorphous silica with purity above 99% as confirmed by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis can be produced by hydrochloric and sulfuric acids leaching of the rice husk, followed by controlled combustion at 600oC for 2\u00a0h. The BET surface area of the silica produced after leaching the rice husk with hydrochloric acid was higher (218 m2/g) than with sulfuric acid (209 m2/g). The silica obtained has potential application as filler in plastics and rubber compounding.",

Tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding was done on SS 304 2B plate with thick-ness of 1.2\u00a0mm in Coraza Systems Malaysia Sdn. Bhd using a KADEYOU machine. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to develop mathematical relation-ships between the welding process parameters (i.e, welding current, filler size and flow rate of the shielding gas) and the output variable of the weld joint (ultimate tensile strength) to determine the welding input parameters that led to the desired weld quality. Comparison between measured and calculated results was in good agreement indicating that the developed models can predict the responses adequately within the limits of welding pa-rameters being used. High welding current (50A) cause microstructure become finer and increase in tensile strength while low current (30A) caused root of the metal plate not weld completely which weakened the joint (724.84\u00a0MPa and 718.33\u00a0MPa, correspond-ingly). The smallest filler (1.6\u00a0mm) was good for tensile strength (745.96 MPA) com-pared to the largest filler (2.4\u00a0mm and 720.90\u00a0MPa strength) because high heat energy used to melt the large filler also overheated the metal base that cause crack formation. High flow rate (14 cfh) caused tensile strength to drop (738.49\u00a0MPa) due to the turbu-lence in the molten metal compared to the lowest flow rate (10 cfh and tensile 756.75\u00a0MPa strength).",

In this paper, the effect of MF on the corrosion of copper in 0.5\u00a0M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, with or without corrosion inhibitor were studied. Benzotriazole (BTA), a common copper inhibitor, was chosen as the inhibitor for this study. To determine the effect of MF, a MF of 13 mT, generated using a pair of permanent neodymium magnet, was applied during weight loss and electrochemical tests. The results showed that corrosion inhibition efficiency of BTA decreased when it is under an applied MF. A decrease from 47% to 60% in inhibition efficiency had been observed for all samples in an applied MF. By using Tafel extrapolation technique on the polarization curves, it revealed that MF had increased the corrosion current of copper in HCl, causing a decrease in the inhibition efficiency.",

These fine cells consist of a mixture of eutectic Si particles and intermetallic Al3Ce and CeAl1.2Si0.8 phase in Al matrix. The amount of rod- like intermetallic Al3Ce and CeAl1.2Si0.8 phase increases with increasing Ce content. The microhardness of Al-20Si alloys increases with the increase in Ce content. Addition of Ce up to 1.61\u00a0wt.% Ce improve the wear properties of Al-20Si alloy.",

All the samples were subjected to curing and tensile test. All the results were compared with pure gum of natural rubber. The curing characteristics of PAL/NR nanocomposites such as minimum and maximum torque were higher at optimum filler loading, PAL4. It means that the optimum filler loading would produce higher rigidity of the sample. Thus, PAL4 had higher stiffness compared to other filler loading. The scorch time and cure time of the sample that had undergone melt mixing and latex compounding method were higher compared to NR. The increase in both scorch time and cure time revealed that the presence of PAL could increase the curing process of the nanocomposites. Furthermore, PAL4 showed 18% increment in tensile strength. These results showed the optimum filler loading can increase the compatibility between PAL and NR. The size and shape of the PAL and the combination of melt mixing and latex compounding method might also contribute to this improvement. The morphology characteristics of all PAL/NR nanocomposites sample showed thicker tear line and rougher surface compared to control sample, NR. This might due to the homogenous dispersion of PAL which contains optimum filler loading.

Two sets of PLA microspheres with and without hydrophilic monomers were irradiated using high energy irradiations which are electron beam and Gamma (\u03b3) rays respectively. Although dose used in irradiating samples were same for both electron beam and \u03b3-rays, but the dose rate were different where electron beam has the higher dose rate. Free radicals will be formed when a matter is irradiated with ionising radiation and these radicals will interact with monomers and initiate grafting. Three hydrophilic monomers were used in this study i.e. Acrylic Acid (AA), Acrylamide and Maleic Anhydride (MAH). Surface modified PLA microspheres were characterised using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). PLA microspheres surface were successfully modified and grafted with selected monomers and confirmed by FTIR results. The degrees of grafting were found to be dependent on irradiation dose and dose rate of irradiation as well as monomer used in the grafting.

Results indicated that the maximum torque of EPDM/Bt composite decreases at high bentonite loading. Increasing in values with increasing bentonite loading was recorded for minimum torque and optimum cure time of EPDM/Bt composite. The increase is related with the increase in viscosity due to the increasing of bentonite clay loading in EPDM matrix. Scorch time was found to be decreasing up to 30 phr bentonite clay. Results also show that tear strength of EPDM/Bt composite increased with increasing bentonite loading up to 90 phr. The reason is probably due to agglomeration occur causes the reduction in properties at high loading above 90 phr bentonite clay.

Influence of the prepared interfacial modifier on enhancement of rubber-filler interaction was studied by focusing on the cure characteristics and the mechanical properties of silica filled natural rubber at a fixed silica content of 30 phr. In comparison with silica filled compound without silane coupling agent, shorter scorch and cure times, lower Payne effect and higher tensile strength of silica filled natural rubber were achieved with the presence of interfacial modifier at 2.4 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr). This was attributed to an active reaction of silanol groups with interfacial modifier and compatibility between modifier and natural rubber. For HTNR-treated compound to obtain optimum properties, mixing should be carried out at initial mixing temperature of 300C, mixing time of 12\u00a0minutes, and rotor speed of 60\u00a0rpm. However, TESPT is more effective than HTNR because it imposes better properties than HTNR.",

     "abstract": "Currently, there is a significant drive to switch to more sustainable and renewable materials, whilst still reducing weight and cost and maintaining reliability. In addition, with some renewable materials, end-of-life vehicle issues are more easily addressed because the materials are biodegradable or easily recycled. Natural fibres such as flax fibre (FF)have several advantages that have made them particularly attractive to the automobile industry. These include relatively good mechanical strength, low density better thermal and acoustic insulation and low cost. The aim of this study was to produce optimised Nonwoven Flax Fibre Reinforced Acrodur (NWFA) biocomposites. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to study the effect of processing conditions such as moisture content, curing temperature and curing time on flexural strength and modulus. The optimized conditions was analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the optimized value for the maximum flexural strength of NWFA biocomposites was found at 25% moisture content, 1700C curing temperature and 180\u00a0seconds curing time. Maximum flexural strength and modulus of 44.83\u00a0MPa and 4.70\u00a0GPa were attained. From the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique, namely the Box\u2013Behnken method, curing temperature significantly affects the strength of NWFA biocomposites, followed by the moisture content and curing time. The P-value of the model of the experiment is less than 0.05 and the determination coefficient (R2) is nearly 1 suggesting that the model is significant and implies on the precision and processability in the production.",

Two coating techniques were implemented in this study; one being a simple black soot coating and the other utilized a commercial Au/Pd coating that is commonly used for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation. The former technique was forwarded after considering that when the sample is white in color, usually microscopic observation via optical microscopy is quite difficult. Polarized light was also applied as another supporting tool to counter the light reflectance problem occurred in the observed white sample. Good quality digital images were successfully produced using both coating techniques with the assistance of polarized light projected via the optical microscope. It was proven that the sample with the proposed black soot coating is able to give high quality image with high level of contrast. The results showed that images with clear cell boundaries were obtained and these images were comparable or much better than those obtained with the Au/Pd coating technique. Finally, images with improved contrast were inverted using an image analysis procedure which allows better determination of foam cell features in polyethylene foams. The use of the proposed technique as supplementary device for real-time microscopic observation during foam compression was also proven to be a success.",

However, due to the higher cost of SAC (expensive Ag), research have now been directed to find a lower cost lead-free solder with comparable or better performance to the Sn-Pb or SAC, i.e low Ag SAC or Sn-Cu solders. The solder alloys developed in this work were SAC 0305 (0.3 wt% Ag, 0.5 wt% Cu and bal. Sn) and SAC0305 with 1 wt% Al and 2 wt% Al. The addition of Al is expected to refine the \u03b2-Sn grains and contribute to higher solder strength. Characterization of the solder alloys focused on the bulk solder microstructure, intermetallic compound (IMC) evaluation and wettability of solder alloys in reflowed and aged conditions. Reflow temperature was 270\u00a0\u00b0C while aging was done isothermally in normal atmosphere for 100, 200 and 500\u00a0hours at 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 150\u00a0\u00b0C. Microstructure of bulk solder and the IMC formed at interface between solder and Cu substrate were observed using SEM equipped with EDX. Wettability of solder was evaluated via wetting force and time, and the wetting angle between solder and the Cu substrate. A low Ag content resulted in fine Ag3Sn IMC as compared to much larger needle Ag3Sn observed in the commercial SAC 305 (Ag 3.0 wt%). With Al addition, SEM result showed finer \u03b2-Sn dendrites with fine Ag3Sn and Cu6Sn5 distributed within the eutectic colony of the bulk solder, and also thinner IMC layer in reflowed samples. Isothermally aged samples on the other hand, showed thicker IMC layer for Al added solder samples. This could be attributed to the finer \u03b2-Sn dendrites in the bulk solder providing more diffusion path and increased the thickness of IMC layer. The IMC formed at the interface between solder and the copper substrate was identified as Cu6Sn5 in reflowed samples, and both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn when aged.

It is chemically similar to the mineral component of bone and teeth and will form an artificial bone-like structure with the surrounding bone tissue when implanted. However, sintered hydroxyapatite material exhibits relatively poor mechanical properties than natural bone and as such, improvement of mechanical properties are necessary. One of the candidate materials for the reinforcing phase to HAp is zirconia, ZrO2. Medical applications of ZrO2 implants confirmed their satisfactory biocompatibility, although it cannot bond well to bone tissue. In this study, ZrO2/HApbiocomposites were fabricated with the objective to improve the strength and toughness of the biomaterial. Commercial CaO-ZrO2 (CZ) was selected as the reinforced material to the HAp matrix. Small amounts of CaF2 were added to improve sinterability and the phase stability of these biocomposites. Conventional ceramic processing route was used to prepare ZrO2/HAp samples, which involved milling and mixing, compaction and sintering. X-ray diffraction (XRD), linear shrinkages, density and porosity, flexural strength, Vickers microhardness, toughness, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the (ZrO2/HAp) biocomposites. XRD results indicate phase stability of biocomposites to a temperature of 1200\u00a0\u00b0C. Shrinkage of fired samples were very uniform with increasing temperature, with slightly lower shrinkage in thickness direction. In general, strength of the reinforced ZrO2/HAp was successfully increased from 35.70\u00a0MPa to 52.88\u00a0MPa and the toughness was increased from 0.65\u00a0MPa.m1/2 to 1.33\u00a0MPa.m1/2 as well.",

Mg possesses a number of attractive characteristics that make Mg-based materials potential candidates to serve as implants for load-bearing applications in the medical industry due to its good biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, Mg and its alloys are susceptible to suffer attack in chloride containing solutions, e.g. the human body fluid or blood plasma. Thus, alloying with other metal elements is the most effective tool to improve mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Mg. In this current work, binary Mg-Zn alloy was produced using mechanical alloying (MA) followed by compaction and sintering. The aim of this work was to study the effect of milling time on binary magnesium-zinc (Mg-Zn) alloy synthesized by mechanical alloying. A powder mixture of Mg and Zn with the composition of Mg-10wt%Zn was milled in a planetary mill under argon atmosphere using a stainless steel container and balls. Milling process was carried out at 250\u00a0rpm for various milling times i.e. 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15\u00a0hours. 3% n-heptane solution was added prior to milling process to avoid excessive cold welding of the powder. Then, as-milled powder was compacted under 400\u00a0MPa and sintered in a tube furnace at 350\u00a0\u00b0C in argon flow. The refinement analysis of the x-ray diffraction patterns shows the presence of Mg-Zn solid solution and formation of MgZn2 when Mg-Zn powder was mechanically milled for 2\u00a0hours and further.

When the chemical reaction was completed, the precipitate was dried, ground and characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy (both FESEM and TEM) and particle size analysis. Only the nitrate precursor produced a single-phase carbonated hydroxyapatite (cHA), whilst the other two precursors produced a secondary calcite phase or did not react fully. This is due to the low solubility of the calcium hydroxide and the incomplete reaction of the calcium carbonate.

In this study, focus on biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using Polygonum hydropiper extract and its catalytic degradation of hazardous dye, methylene blue has been highlighted. The rapid reduction of silver (Ag) ions was monitored using UV-Visible spectrophotometer and showed formation of silver nanoparticles within less than one hour with maximum absorption of silver nanoparticles at 430\u00a0nm. The major functional groups present in the synthesis responsible for the formation of silver nanoparticles. It was identified by using Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR). Field Electron Scanning Microscope (FESEM) was used to characterise the nanoparticles synthesized using P.hydropiper. The morphology of silver nanoparticles was predominantly spherical and aggregated into irregular structure with average diameter of 60\u00a0nm. In addition, this report emphasizes the effect of the silver nanoparticles on the degradation rate of hazardous dyes by sodium borohydride (NaBH4).

An open ended coaxial probe connected to a vector network analyzer (VNA) was utilized for the evaluation of dielectric properties for materials and composites under test at the room temperature. Both dielectric constant and loss factor values increased due to the filler increment in the polymer matrix, where the composition of 15% NZF gives the extreme permittivity value at the used microwave frequency. Furthermore, the obtained results confirmed that dielectric properties of the composite can be controlled by the proper loading and the wise filler choosing.

     "abstract": "Major cavities and underground drainage tend to develop with the aid of massive or thick-bedded and well-jointed limestone whilst porous and soft limestone is more likely to form micro-cavities and localized karst along bedding and close to ground level. This phenomenon wouldprobably be explained by studying the movement of water circulating through the pores in the limestone. Strong correlations between fracture patterns and drainage lines/cavity zones have been long suspected by many researchers in the past (Mayer, et al., 2003). An assumption has been made that fractures offer lines of decreased hydraulic resistance to groundwater flow and therefore they are more easily exploited by weathering and erosion processes than their adjacent rock (Sower, 1975 and Ericson et al., 2004). The end product of the weathering and erosion process is a river channel or active cavity, developed along fractures orientation. Thus, the karstic surfaces are consistently developed along the joint sets orientated at limestone is strongly fractured with the dominant joint orientations. In this paper, a methodology for karstified susceptibility assessment of three selected limestone formations is presented specifically looking at tectonic history, joint pattern, and topographyand karstification intensity. Structural analysis, based on rose diagram and stereographic equal-angle projection method have been used to analyze the joint orientations.",

Both bacterial strains were able to produce high amounts of biosurfactants interacted with pyrite that had an important role in their adhesion on the surface of pyrite as well as the change of pyrite surface properties. Over the course of the experiments, the pH of the solutions gradually decreased to \u223c3, indicating the active oxidation of pyrite minerals by bacteria. The growth of both bacterial strains resulted in the generation of biosurfactants as represented by the decrease of the surface tension of the solutions and the increase of the contact angle of the pyrite surfaces as a function of time. However, the contact angle of pyrite surfaces gradually decreased after 5 days of incubation until the experiments terminated on 30 days. Scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) analyses also confirmed the role of both bacterial strains in changing the pyrite surface properties to be more hydrophobic or more hydrophilic depending on the time of incubation. These results indicate that the changes of pyrite surface properties are clearly as the results of bacterial action, likely serving as both bio-collector or bio-frother and depressant that would be very applicable for flotation processes. These results increase our knowledge on the interactions in pyrite-bacteria complexes and could potentially be a very useful result with real exploitable value for those working on sulfide bioflotation processes.",

In this study, we focused on enzymatic production of XOS from cassava peel and waste, which is a low cost material with a relatively high xylan content.

Next, after centrifugation, the obtained filtrate was precipitated with ethanol (ratio 1:3) and dried at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. The NaOH pretreatment enabled almost 4.83% and 6.23% recovery of the xylan that was present in the cassava peel and waste.

The results were not so different from the hydrolysis of xylan from oat spelt xylan, but showed a relatively lower yield.",

     "abstract": "\u03b2-D-xylosidases are hemicellulases that catalyze the release of xylose units from short xylooligosaccharides. Their activity is the rate-limiting step in xylan hydrolysis. A major application of these enzymes is as eco-friendly biobleaching agents in the pulp and paper industry, where thermostable, alkaliphilic xylosidases are much preferred. Hence, the isolation and characterization of new thermo-alkaliphilic xylosidases from nature, or re-engineering existing ones is of importance for industrial applications. The thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus thermoleovorans IT-08 produces a meso-thermophilic \u03b2-D-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37), which has a unique primary structure compared to other xylosidases with only 32-35% amino acid sequence identity. Here, we describe the role of Asp121 in modulating the enzyme's pH-activity profile. Mutation of this residue into Val121 or Asn121 increased its pH optimum by 3 pH units with a significant decrease in its activities. Furthermore, all mutants showed a significant 40\u00a0\u00b0C increase in optimum temperature compared to wild-type enzyme. This study thus illustrates the importance of the pKa modulator residue Asp121 in shifting the pH- and temperature-activity profile of the enzyme. Changing Asp/Asn residues in enzymes, especially when the residue is located near the catalytic site, may be a useful strategy for adapting the enzyme to a high pH and high temperature environment.",

The goals of this research were to study the effect of fermentation and storage on antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in buffalo, goat and cow milks and yoghurts. Samples of buffalo, goat, cow milks and their yoghurts during their fermentation and storage were determined for proximate analysis and bioactive activities including antioxidant activities of DPPH, ABTS and reducing power assays, and antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Results showed that buffalo, cow and goat yoghurts had antioxidant activities in all assays and their activities significantly increased during their fermentation. Pasteurization did not affect the antioxidant activities. The activities of all yoghurts remained unchanged after a storage time of 21 days at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. For the antimicrobial activities, only yoghurts from buffalo, cow and goat milks had the activities, while all milks did not show any activities. However, buffalo yoghurt could inhibit only Gram positive strains (S. aureus and B. cereus), while goat and cow yoghurt inhibited all tested strains. A chemical responsible for antimicrobial activities in yoghurts was lactic acid formed by lactic acid bacteria. However, bioactive peptides produced by protein digestion during milk fermentation by lactic acid bacteria could not be ruled out for antioxidant and antimicrobial activities present. The antimicrobial activities of all yoghurts remained constant during their storage. It is concluded that all yoghurts would retain milk nutrition and bioactive functions during their storage in a refrigerator and may be served as a functional food with benefits from those activities for consumers.",

Water-soluble AgInS2-ZnS quantum dots (QDs) encapsulated with oleylamine have been successfully prepared without the presence of surfactant or polymer. During the propagation process, ultrasonication creates harmonic pressure (relative to the equilibrium hydrostatic pressure of the liquid), which was helpful for the dispersion of nanomaterials in two immiscible phases. The highly photoluminescent ZnS coated AgInS2 QDs (up to 55.3% QY) was synthesized with a one-pot two-step process with narrow particle distribution and successfully transferred to water phase without significant effect on optical properties. Beside QDs characterization, some factors such as pH stability, ionic strength, and bonding properties were investigated to reach a good condition of water soluble AgInS2-ZnS QDs. These nanoparticles also showed potential application for cancer cell staining. To demonstrate the targeting capability, folic acid was further conjugated with oleylamine encapsulated AgInS2-ZnS QDs for HeLa and MCF7 cancer cell staining. This study also reveals that the water-soluble QDs still gave lower fluorescence intensity on confocal imaging, even without folic acid conjugation. Moreover, folic acid is efficiently internalized into cells through folate receptor-mediated endocytosis. Confocal imaging characterization further informs folic acid-conjugated AgInS2-ZnS QDs that could specifically be targeted to the human cervical (HeLa) cells.",

The ammonia pretreatments were compared against the standard NaOH method. The best tested Pressurized Chamber method conditions were at 100\u00a0\u00b0C with 3 hour retention time, 12.5% Ammonium hydroxide and 1:30 solid loading.

Compared with optimum SAA method (24 hour, 6.25% of ammonium hydroxide at room temperature), Pressurized Chamber method was capable of producing enhanced delignification and higher production of sugar upon hydrolysis. These findings were supported by the disappearance peak at 1732, 1512 and 1243 on Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR spectrum) of treated OPEFB by Pressurized Chamber method.

The cytotoxicity assay results showed that A.serratus leaves extract was not toxic and has CC50 >100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Mode of action experiment results suggested that A.serratus extract inhibited HCV at the post-entry step. Further fractionation of leaves extract by open column chromatography resulted in 4 fractions. Only Fraction 1 (AP-5F.1) exhibited anti-HCV with IC50 value of 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml against HCV JFH1a. Separation of AP-5F.1 by open column chromatography resulted in 15 fractions. Fraction number 13 (AP-5F.1.13) exhibited anti-HCV with IC50 value of 0.43\u00a0\u03bcg/ml against HCV JFH1a. Separation of AP-5F.1.13 by semi preparative-HPLC resulted in isolate identified by TLC and LC-MS method as chlorophyll derivate. There was a possibility that chlorophyll derivate has participated in performing the anti-HCV activity of fractions and extract besides the other compounds contained. In this study, we concluded that A. serratus leaves extract, AP-5F.1, and AP-5F.1.13 exhibited anti-HCV activity against JFH1a virus.",

     "abstract": "Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a major global disease which often leads to chronicity and is potential to liver failure. There is no anti-HCV vaccine and the high diversity of viral genotypes will probably make it very difficult to develop a vaccine. Therefore, the development of new drugs for HCV treatment is highly required. It is commonly known that numerous important modern drugs have been developed from molecules originally isolated from natural sources. In this study, we tested the leave extract and fractions of Ficus fistulosa for their anti-HCV activities by cell culture method using Huh7it cells and HCV JFH1a. The result showed that ethanol extract of Ficus fistulosa (FFL) inhibited HCV JFH1a with IC50 value of 20.43\u00b14.51\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Toxicity test also indicated that FFL was not toxic with CC50 value of >200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. The extract was further fractionated using chloroform (FFLC) and butanol (FFLB) successively. FFLC showed anti-HCV activity with IC50 value of 5.67\u00b11.54\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and CC50 value of >100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (Selectivity index >17.65). Further separation of FFLC by open column chromatography resulted in 12 subfractions (FFLC1-C12). Two subfractions, FFLC10, and FFLC11 showed high selectivity index (>100) with IC50 value of 0.60\u00b10.30\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 0.43\u00b10.29\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively. Therefore the leave extract (FFL) and fractions (FFL10, FFL11) of Ficus fistulosa would be a good candidate to develop antiviral against HCV.",

We also carried out pathological anatomy and examined any histopathologyical changes. The results indicate that sparrows are more resistant to the H5N1 virus infection than chicken. The striking organ changes of sparrows died because of the virus infection were lungs and brains haemorrhage. Lung damage seemed to be the main cause of the chicken's death. Neuronal necrosis and gliosis seemed to cause the torticollis of sparrow. The H5N1 virus isolated from sparrow that was more virulent against sparrow than the virus isolated from chicken indicate the occurrence of sparrow's adaptation with the sparrow virus.

The precise mechanisms by which inositol improves such parameters are yet to be elucidated. The present study was performed to investigate the effect of inositol supplementation on growth, fermentation performance and plasma membrane fluidity during normal gravity fermentation. Yeast cells were grown in a chemically defined fermentation medium with 15% (w/v) glucose, lacking inositol and with 0.1 or 0.4\u00a0g/L inositol supplementation. Cell density, cell viability, glucose consumption and ethanol production were monitored for 96\u00a0hours. Plasma membrane fluidity was monitored at 24\u00a0hours fermentation, representing the respiro-fermentative growth phase, by measuring generalized polarization (GP) of laurdan. The effect of ethanol on membrane fluidity also monitored by measuring GP after exposing cell to 18% (v/v) ethanol. The results of the present experiment indicated that although inositol supplementation did not seem to improve fermentation performance as assessed by glucose consumption and ethanol production, it did improve cell growth leading to higher cell densities. While inositol-supplemented cells had higher growth rates and cell density, they had significantly lower viability, thus the viable cell counts were similar with and without supplementation. There is also evidence that inositol supplementation leads to increased membrane fluidity with significantly lower GP values for yeast cells grown in the inositol supplemented media. However when exposed to high ethanol concentrations, inositol-supplemented yeasts showed a greater GP decrease than those grown without inositol. Thus, interestingly, the non- supplemented yeasts with lower baseline membrane fluidity seemed to better withstand the fluidizing effects of ethanol. We are in the process of confirming the viability of ethanol-treated cells as well as furthering the investigations on inositol effects on stress tolerance and other physiological parameters.",

In this study, the particles size, arrangement and morphology of the film formed from modified latexes were monitored using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) for various latexes treated with either urea or sodium dodecyl sulphate and combination of both as deproteinisation agent. The size of latex particles changed after deproteinisation and the arrangement of particles when films are formed revealed interesting packing occurrence between the deproteinised latexes. These occurrences were shown to be associated to chemicals or surfactant used in the deproteinisation. The use of urea in combination with sodium dodecyl sulphate in the deproteinisation contributed to good latex particles packing during film formation attributed to the appearance of soft shell latex particles. Clearly, the latex particles and film morphologies is profoundly influenced by the type of deproteinisation agents used.",

However, the consensus value has a weakness in that it could be significantly different from the true value due largely inexperienced laboratories. Therefore in this work, the reference values were used as the assigned values for all analytes of interest. The reference values in spiked drinking water samples were produced by the Metrology in Chemistry Laboratory of Research Center for Chemistry - Indonesian Institute of Sciences (RCChem-LIPI) with traceable to SI units through standard solutions from the National Institute Standard and Technology, USA.

     "abstract": "Artocarpus altilis(Parkinson) Fosberg), a tropical tree, belonging to Moraceae family has been known in folk medicine to have some health benefits in particular for inflammation, infection, diabetes and even some cardiovascular problems. One of risk factors of some cardiovascular diseases is hypercholesterolemia. Previous in vitro works showed that ethyl acetate fraction of A. altilis exhibited cytoprotective effect in human U937 cells treated with oxidized LDL. This current work aimed to investigate the effect of ethyl acetate (EA) fraction from the leaves of Sukun, on serum total cholesterol level and on lipid deposition in aorta in vivo.The EA fraction was administered in 8-weeks-Wistar rats fed with high cholesterol diet for 30 days. The serum total cholesterol was dosed using enzimatic test and lipid accumulation in aorta was examined by histology of parafin-blocked aorta stained with hematoxilin-eosin. Antioxidant capacity of flavonoids contained in EA fraction was examined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) method. The result showed that EA fractions at doses 150 and 300\u00a0mg/kg BW were able to lower significantly serum total cholesterol and to prevent lipid accumulation in rat aorta. DPPH examination of flavonoids which were cyclocommunol, 1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-[8-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-5-yl]-1-propanone or AC-31 and 2-geranyl-2\u2032,3,4,4\u2032-tetrahydroxydihydrochalcone or AC-51 showed IC50 value 1548.8\u00b1486.8, 275.3\u00b110.0 and 94.1\u00b11.4\u00a0\u03bcM respectively. It is concluded that the EA fraction is able to lower serum total cholesterol and to prevent lipid accumulation in rat aorta, therefore, has the potential medicinal effect to prevent atherosclerosis. Furthermore, its content of flavonoid especially 2-geranyl-2\u2032,3,4,4\u2032-tetrahydroxydihydrochalcone is suggested to contribute to this effect by acting as antioxidant.",

Its performance was evaluated twice with 70 respondents and the measurements considered satisfying when the results were laid in the range of one square deviation from the real value that determined by spectrophotometer. Performance tests results then compared to pH measurement using pH indicator, the more familiar test kit that also rely on human ability to distinguish color. The first performance test to respondents that closely related to chemical measurement got 33 success results and 29 respondents gave satisfying results which was comparable to pH measurement that gave 31 of 33 satisfying results. The second performance test was conducted by 70 respondents which involving respondents with background that unrelated to chemical measurement. As much as 34 success results for both measurements from the related group but only 32 and 27 success measurements for pH measurement and Vitamin B6 measurement using kit, respectively, from the unrelated group. The second performance test results for pH measurement did not give significant difference with the second one, 34 of 35 satisfying results from closely related group and 27 of 32 from unrelated group. Second performance test results for Vitamin B6 was significantly different from the first one since the respondents required to conduct the measurement twice and the results were reported as average values.

     "abstract": "Monochloroacetic acid (MCA) production continues to grow every year and it causes environmental problems. Klebsiella pneumoniae ITB1 is identified to be able to grow on minimum medium with MCA as a sole of carbon source. This strain breaks down MCA to produce 2-hydroxyacetic acid and releases chloride ion into the medium, which can be detected by colorimetric method. Enzyme responsible for this activity is haloacid dehalogenase. This experiment amplified the haloacid dehalogenase gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae ITB1 by PCR. The result was 0.69\u00a0kb DNA fragment. This fragment was cloned to pGEM-T easy and then transformed to competent E. coli TOP10 cells. Recombinant colonies were selected based on ampicillin resistant and \u03b2-galactosidase activity. Recombinant plasmid confirmation was conducted by size screening, re-PCR, and restriction analysis. The restriction analysis showed positive result as the EcoRI digests of pGEM-HAD recombinant produced two DNA fragments of 3.15\u00a0kb and 0.71\u00a0kb. Nucleotide sequence of hakp1 DNA fragment confirmed that it is a haloacid dehalogenase gene with 99% similarity to Klebsiella pneumonia. Amino acids sequence deduced by in silico analysis of hakp1 showed 100% sequence similarity with haloacid dehalogenase of multispecies Klebsiella (Accession No. WP_004179015.1). Conserve residues analysis using ClustalW2 of Hadkp1 protein compared to another three haloacid dehalogenases i.e. from Burkholderia cepacia MBA4, Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10, and Pseudomonas sp. YL showed 20 conserve residues. Five of the 20 conserve residues were catalytic residues, which are aspartate (D), threonine (T), serine (S), lysine (K) and tyrosine (Y). The 3D structure of Hadkp1 protein predicted by in silico analysis has been conducted by I TESSER. Blastp analysis also showed that Hadkp1 protein of Klebsiella pneumoniae ITB1 has high similarity to enolase-phosphatase of Klebsiella pneumonia. Enolase-phosphatase is an enzyme that catalyzes dephosphorylation and enolization of 1-phosphonooxy-2,2-dihydroxy-3-oxo-5-methylthiopentane to 1,2-dihydroxy3-oxo-5-(methylthio)-pent-1-ene.

In order to understand the thermo-chemical behavior of CSP more fully and to estimate the chemical composition, the lignin content was determined by the ASTM D 1106 \u2013 96 method and a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) were done on the lignin as well. The CSP was pyrolysed at 550\u00a0\u00b0C to determine the ash content and using atomic absorption spectroscopy the types of metal in ash were determined. Apart from silica which could not be measured, sodium, potassium, zinc, calcium and iron were found to be the main metals. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used for a better understanding of the chemical structure of CSP.",

UAE was done under various level of time and temperature with the best combination found was 5 minutes and 25oC respectively. VE of the extract at 125 mmHg and water bath temperature set at 65oC showed that concentrate concentration factor (CF) was linearly correlated to its TPC and AA. Stability study of the concentrate under different storage temperature (4oC and 25oC) without preservative was done for 14 days. Higher CF enhanced shelf life and AA stability in both storage temperatures. This study concluded that UAE may reduce the required extraction temperature and time used for yielding extract with higher TPC and AA. Also, VE may concentrate the extract without damaging its TPC and AA. Lastly, VE may provide higher TPC, AA, and increasing storage stability while reducing extract volume compared to non-concentrated extract.",

The mechanical properties such as hardness, abrasion resistance and tensile stress at 300% elongation were studied. In the hardness and abrasion resistance measurement, the higher ratio CB/Si decrease contribution of silica, which resulting smaller of hardness value. Ratio CB/Si 40/20 gives an optimum filler blended. It is also clearly understood that higher abrasion resistance mainly due to the lower hardness value under the same condition.

In the present study, we were interested to evaluate the molecular mechanism of opening RmL lid segment from its closed state in aqueous solvent by using targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) approach. The external forces about 0.125\u00a0kcal/(mol.\u00c5) was applied in TMD to push the closed state of RmL lid toward the targeted open state. The results showed that RmL lid was fail to reach the targeted structure, in which the final structure was stacked at about 65% opening. The comparative structural analysis between the partially and fully open states revealed the caused of the sterical hindrance preventing the lid segment to reach the fully open state. Strong hydrophobic interactions among Trp88 with the surrounding non-polar residues in the active site was the major caused for the sterical hindrance. This restriction will protect the active site of the enzyme to be fully exposed to the solvent, thereby minimizing the accessibility of non-substrate molecules into the active site.",

The aim of this research is to study the influence of the temperature and the feed to solvent ratio towards the yield, the dye color intensity and the phenolic content using the two factor factorial design in the avocado seed UAE. The avocado seed was crushed and blended with aquades as much as 70% from the seed mass. The slurry was incubated at 24\u00a0\u00b0C for 35\u00a0minutes.

     "abstract": "Carbonic Anhydrase II (CAII) has role in pH regulation, water transport and hydration of CO2. In addition, CAII is also related to many diseases, including glaucoma, tumours, epilepsy, diabetes and osteopetrosis. Various inhibitors for CAII have been developed and commercialized as a drug. Recent development of CAII inhibitors drive the invention of novel inhibitors based on natural product structures and their derivatives. This research aim to screen potential inhibitors from phenolic and flavonoid groups by in silico approach. The screening of natural products compounds was performed by a molecular docking method. The best ligand derived from the molecular docking selection was further refined with a molecular dynamics simulation and the resulted structure was used to evaluate the stability of CAII-ligand complex. By using the upper mentioned procedures, fisetin (Fic) and 6-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalene-1,3,7-triol (Afr3) were strongly suggested to be a potent inhibitor for CAII.",

     "abstract": "In the last few years, biodiesel has emerged as one of the most potential renewable energy to replace current petrol-derived diesel. It is a renewable, biodegradable and non-toxic fuel which can be easily produced through esterification of triglycerides (vegetable oils or animal fats) or esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) with methanol. However, current commercial usage of refined vegetable oils for biodiesel production is impractical and uneconomical due to high feedstock cost and priority as food resources. Low-grade oil, can be a better alternative; however, the high free fatty acids (FFA) content has become the main drawback for this potential feedstock. Solid acid catalysts offer significant advantages of eliminating separation, corrosion, toxicity and environmental problems. Recently, a new strategy of preparing novel carbon-based solid acids has been developed. In this research, the esterification reactions of Palm Fatty Acid Disttillate (PFAD) with methanol, using carbon based solid catalyst from coconut shell activated carbon as catalyst, were studied. The ester preparation involved an esterification reaction, followed by purification. In this study, the activated carbon catalyst catalysts were synthesized by sulfonating the activated carbon using concentrated H2SO4. The physico-characteristics and acid site densities were analyzed by Nitrogen gas adsorption, FT-IR, X-ray fluorescent (XRF), and acid-base back titration methods. The effects of the molar ratio of methanol to oil (6:1 to 12:1), the amount of catalyst (1-10%), and the reaction temperature (40, 50 and 60oC) were studied for the conversion of FFA to optimize the reaction conditions. The optimal conditions were an methanol/PFAD molar ratio of 12:1, the amount of catalyst of 10%wt., and reaction temperature of 60oC.",

All structural bioinformatics analysis presented here were carried out by evaluating the relative difference of various analysed parameters between all halophiles proteins including the references and the nonhalophiles ones. Lipase samples from the six Bledug Kuwu bacterial isolates displayed different profiles in amino acid composition, secondary structures, solvent accessible surface areas, radius of gyrations and salt bridges compare to those of all the references structures including OSMOL and SALT-IN proteins. These differences may be correlated to the unique halophiles habitat of all six bacteria isolates, which is the salty mud crater situated at the mainland and far from the sea. Therefore, based on this analysis we can expect that the biochemical and structural property of those six lipase samples were unique as well.",

     "abstract": "The food packaging materials commonly used is made from polymers synthetic base on petroleum derivatives. However, the use of synthetic polymers has negative impacts on the environment, because it is difficult to degrade naturally either by biotic or abiotic process. This is a problem for the environment and therefore it needs to do the assessment of the technology to reduce the degree of difficulty on its degradation or to find a new material that can be degradable naturally. One of the most important properties of food packaging materials is the polymer crystallinity. This refers to the overall level of crystalline component in relationship to its amorphous component. It is directly related to many of key properties exhibited by a semi-crystalline polymer including brittleness, toughness, stiffness or modulus, optical clarity, creep or cold flow, barrier resistance and long-term stability. Thus, in this study, PP blends with the PLA and meltsat 250oCfor 4\u00a0hours, and investigates their crystallization and melting behavior using DSC at cooling rate of 10 and 40oC/min. The results show that base on their thermograms, with increasing the cooling rate will decreasing the crystallinity or increasing amorphous area underthe peaks.",

Second generation of bioethanol production usually uses lignocellulosic material as its raw material which conducted at high temperature range (70-80oC). In this case the thermophilic microbe is needed for fermentation process in order to minimize the use of energy. This paper will discuss the results of the study on bioethanol production from glucose by using thermophilic microbes isolated from local source namely from Ciater hot springs in Subang District, Indonesia. In this study six thermophilic isolates (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6) were tested their capability in producing ethanol in the fermentation medium containing 5% glucose substrate for 5 days incubation. To determine the activity of isolates in ferment substrate is done by measuring the concentration of glucose and ethanol produced using a spectrophotometer. Isolates tested (C1,C2,C3,C4 and C5) could reduce glucose concentration from 1.1up to 1.7% in the fermentation medium. The ethanol produced was tested qualitatively by reacting the samples with K2Cr2O7inacidic conditions by observing its color change from yellow-orange to green-blue. The presence of ethanol indicatedby the decrease of OD's sample. This study showed that all isolates have the ability to produce ethanol.

Results showed that in vitro anthelmintic assay of crude ethanol extract relatively gave better results with respect to paralysis and death of earthworms compared to its decoction counterpart. Meanwhile, both organic soluble extracts exhibited notably better anthelmintic activities and were faster to bring about paralysis on the worms as compared to the aqueous and alcoholic extracts. Furthermore, all fractions of the nonpolar and mid-polar extracts showed significantly higher anthelmintic activities compared to its mother extracts (RTH and RTC). Additionally, among all organic fractions tested, RTC4 showed fairly high mortality rates incurred on the test organisms in which similar result was obtained in comparison for its two parent crude extracts RTC and RTE.

While on 2014, the PT was conducted for citrate buffer solution but no corresponding standard reference solution was provided; thus the participant laboratory can used their own reference standard. The PT for both phthalate and phosphate buffer in 2013 were completed by involving 10 participant laboratories. In 2014, the PT was conducted with 90 participant laboratories. The PT results were evaluated based on ISO 13528:2005(E). From 10 participant laboratories on 2013, it was found that 80% of participant for phthalate buffer and a 70% of participant for phosphate buffer attain a satisfactory category. For the PT of citrate buffer on 2014, it was found that 54% of 90 participant have held a satisfactory category. Moreover, form the evaluation regarding the effect of standard reference material usage; it was found that a better result can be achieved by using a reference buffer solution from the RCChem LIPI as the PT provider rather than by using their own standard reference.

Thus, the purpose of this article is to determine the optimal rate of helium flow for the effective correction of polyatomic interferences of vanadium, chromium and arsenic and the reduction of their detection limits in Cl-rich waters. This research has been carried out using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer NexION 300D with a universal cell technology (UCT) (PerkinElmer, USA) and three model solutions. For the detection of vanadium, chromium and arsenic content in chloride matrix water by ICP-MS, a collision mode is preferable for polyatomic interference correction.

In this paper we consider the process of separating silica from charcoal, which is an important step in the production of activated carbon from rice husks in Viet Nam. The efficiency of the process rises with increasing temperature up to 133\u00a0\u00b0C, the ratio of alkali/charcoal up to 0.6 and sodium hydroxide concentration up to 6\u00a0M as well. A regression equation has been obtained, which allows describing the influence of the parameters on the degree of silica separation from the carbon.

The yield of the solid products was about between 47 wt% and 66 wt% and the effective CO2 content which was captured by hydrothermally solid products was between 0.057 ton \u00b7 ton\u20131 and 0.115 ton \u00b7 ton\u20131 following hydrothermal carbonation. In addition, dehydration of solid product occurred at mostly 300\u00a0\u00b0C, while oxidation was started at 50\u00a0\u00b0C. Obviously, both the sorption\u2013dissociation of CO2 in the solution and hydrothermal carbonation process produce a global pressure drop in the system resulting in CO2 mineral sequestration. The carbonation efficiency of solid\u2013fluid interactions at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and after 24\u00a0h period was 25.36% and 0.05 954\u00a0mol of CO2 were consumed by the carbonation process. At the condition applied, observed several possibilities were observed such as: the pH (alkalinity), total inorganic carbon, direct precipitation of carbonates minerals as well as crystallization of carbonates in the solution and solid products.",

     "abstract": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the existing biosolid management practices in cassava starch industries of Thailand have been evaluated and compared with other biosoild management options with a view to reduce GHG emissions and possible energy recovery. The study involved development and application of a spread-sheet based evaluation tool to estimate GHG emissions, benefits such as GHG offsets and possible energy recovery from four different cassava pulp waste management options viz.: (i biodrying followed by production of refuse derived fuel (RDF), (ii) composting, (iii) anaerobic digestion with energy recovery and (iv) landfilling with energy recovery. Parameters such as GHG emissions, benefits in terms of GHG mitigating potential and energy recovery ton\u20131 of cassava pulp waste were determined for each biosolid management option. Total baseline emissions from the existing cassava biosolid management practices were estimated as 4.2\u00a0kg CO2 eq. ton\u20131 of cassava pulp waste. Among the four waste treatment alternatives, biodrying followed by RDF production scenario showed the highest GHG mitigating potential of 85.2\u00a0kg CO2 eq. ton\u20131 cassava pulp. On the other hand, landfill option with biogas flaring resulted in highest net GHG emissions of 28.7 (kg CO2 eq. ton\u20131 cassava pulp). Biodrying followed by RDF has the highest net heat energy gain (NEG) of 1 536\u00a0MJ \u00b7 ton\u20131 of cassava pulp treated. However, for conversion of waste-to-energy, anaerobic digestion has the highest net energy ratio (NER) for heat as well as electricity recovery with high GHG mitigation potential.",

This research can be divided into two groups i.e. selection of liquid medium using shaker to increase the proliferation rate and proliferation of embryogenic callus using TIS. The objectives of this research are to obtain the best medium for increasing embryogenic proliferation rate using shaker and to obtain the best medium and time interval of immersion to increase the proliferation rate using TIS. Approximately 0.3\u00a0g of embryogenic callus from embryoid-line A1 were weighted and cultured in twenty two types of liquid medium for the first research and two types of medium with the composition of MSD and MSA for the second research.

One of them is andrographolide of Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall. A combination of microwave assisted-extraction and the utilization of hydrotrope as the extraction medium is already proved as a potential safe alternative for the separation of andrographolide. Mathematical models of extraction plays a crucial role in basic research of phytoconstituent separation; they are not yet available for hydrotropic-microwave assisted extraction of andrographolide.

The chlorophyll of green leafy vegetable can be used as visible parameters of the quality of vegetables during storage, since it will be degraded gradually along with post-harvest senescence. Therefore, the development of reliable in vivo chlorophyll measurement should be advantageous rather than visual observation for the purpose of quality control and product sortation. Here, the existence of chlorophylls in ten green leafy vegetables were reported as SPAD values of a handheld SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter and % N of an Agriexpert CCN-6000 nitrogen meter (in vivo data), as well as total peak area data of HPLC measurement for chlorophyll a and b after exhaustive extraction using methanol (in vitro data). Both in vivo and in vitro measurement gave comparable grouping of vegetables with high and low content of chlorophyll. Moreover, correlation plots between SPAD values and total peak area of HPLC showed adequate linear correlation (R2 > 0.7), revealing the potency of in vivo observation for the prediction of actual chlorophyll content in commercial leafy vegetables. SPAD values and % N presented strong linear relationship (R2 > 0.9), in which SPAD-meter performed better detection at very low values. The calibration curve for each species of vegetable should be substantial to overcome the limiting factors of in vivo observation, such as leaf size, tissue thickness, and variation of chloroplast distribution.",

The varieties of drought- tolerant soybean become necessary to be cultivated especially in a marginal farmland. The characteristics of these varieties can be identified from the morphology of plants and the content of chlorophylls. Conventional techniques for predicting the variety of drought tolerant are usually labor extensive, time consuming and costly. A simple and rapid method that based on an automatic system to provide predictions on the variety of drought tolerant soybean is proposed in this paper. The method uses a simple multispectral sensor from a web camera that captures physical and physiological characteristics such as leaf areas, plant heights and is also able to calculate the content of chlorophylls. This research also compared fuzzy logic and artificial neural network as artificial intelligence methods to process raw data in order to predict the variety of the drought resistance soybean. The drought tolerant variety can be best predicted by artificial neural network method with an accuracy of about 80%.",

Various vitamin A status indicators are available, but the most commonly used are not sensitive to changes in body reserves of vitamin A, which concentrate in the liver. Serum retinol concentrations can be misleading in some groups of individuals because of lack of sensitivity to total liver reserves. In addition to vitamin A supplementation to preschool children, many countries add preformed vitamin A to a variety of foods in the process of fortification. Indirect indicators that work in the excessive to hypervitaminotic range of liver reserves are needed to monitor such programs. High liver stores have been determined in countries with on-going sugar fortification programs. The retinol isotope dilution test, using deuterium or 13C, is the only current indirect indicator that works in the excessive range of liver reserves. Evaluating population vitamin A status needs to move beyond the measurement of serum retinol concentrations to ensure that we are not tipping the vitamin A scale too far in the wrong direction with the implementation of multiple interventions in the same population groups.",

The research was aimed to utilize coffee wastes for producing a value added products and to reduce environmental pollution burden as well as to evaluate the potential for bioethanol production at probable optimum conditions using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This process allows a yield of 77.29% of bioethanol with respect to the theoretical value, which can be a viable alternative for obtaining second-generation biofuels in rural areas and for coffee smallholder plantation. The bioethanol production cost was assessed from waste coffee processing. In substantial amounts therefore, coffee pulp can be utilized as a potential raw material in bioethanol production in Ijen plateau region of East Java. Bioethanol production cost was IDR 6 000 L\u20131 or USD 0.48 L\u20131. Based on these facts, compared to food crops coffee pulp which is an agricultural waste is a promising alternative feedstock for second generation bioethanol production.",

Pure cis-bixin isolated by flash chromatography and characterized by Fourier Transform Infra Red spectrometry was used as a bixin standard for qualitative and quantitative analysis of annatto extracts which were obtained by accelerated solvents extraction. UV-Vis spectrophotometry analysis shows that the extraction using 100% cyclohexane gives the lowest bixin yield. This is different from the UV-Vis spectra generated with acetone extraction. The difference in percentage of acetone shows significant effects on bixin extraction yields. The use of cyclohexane:acetone (60%: 40%) solution at 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min heating time results the highest total bixin extraction yield (48.00%) as compared to the other solvent ratios, and to the usual extraction methods using the same solvent (29.14%).

In silico prediction of co- and post-translational modifications revealed 25 putative glycosylation sites, one of which reported to be a co-factor stabilizing residue in 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases. Potential protein solubility and degradation (PEST) motifs were also evaluated. Together with the calculated physico-chemical properties the results indicated reasonable solubility but potential instability of the protein in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Further a synthetic h6h-gene was introduced into the prokaryotic or eukaryotic hostsEscherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine protein expression. The protein could be expressed in both organisms, though stability was confirmed to be an issue.",

Low levels of artemisinin in the plant is related to the biosynthetic pathways influenced by specific enzymes that play role in the formation of artemisinin. Farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), which is the main precursor of artemisinin, also known as the precursor for the formation of sterols. Compared with the other compounds, sterol biosynthetic pathway is the biggest competitor of the artemisinin production since sterols are needed by plants to regulate membrane fluidity and permeability. This research aimed to study the effect of terbinafin and DMSO as sterol synthesis inhibitors on the regulation of the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway by analyzing the expression level of two genes linked, squalene synthase (SQS) and amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS) using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the amount of artemisinin is determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that at mRNA levels, terbinafin 30\u00a0\u03bcM had no significant effect on SQS and ADS expression levels, but it increased the amount of artemisinin at 50\u00a0hours incubation up to 1.36 times higher than control.

Over exploitation of this plant will also reduce plant population in its natural habitat. In vitro culture, i.e. through somatic embryogenesis, therefore, can be used as one of an alternative method for plant regeneration as well as for in vitro metabolite production. Based on this reason, the research has been done with an objective to analyze the presence of secondary metabolite in somatic embryo of pasak bumi. Seed-derived callus was used as an explant. This callus was maintained to proliferate in MS (Murashige&Skoog, 1962) medium supplemented with 2.25\u00a0mg/L 2,4-D and 2.0\u00a0mg/L kinetin. A half gram of callus from proliferation medium was transferred into the MS liquid medium containing 1.0 or 2.25\u00a0mg/L 2,4-D, and 2.0\u00a0mg/L BAP or 2.0\u00a0mg/L kinetin. Histochemical examination using Jeffrey's reagen and neutral red showed that alkaloid and terpenoid substances were presence in somatic embryo of pasakbumi. In accordance with histochemical test, GC-MS analyses showed that secondary metabolites was also synthesized by non embryogenic callus and the mixture ofembryogenic callus and somatic embryo, although the concentration in the mixture of embryogenic callus and somatic embryo was lower than those in non-embryogenic callus. Secondary metabolites, including 3-[(cyclohexyl-methyl-amino)-methyl]-3H-benzooxazole-2-one (0.06%) and 2-furancarboxaldehyde, 5-(hydroxymethyl) (43.024%) were found in embryogenic callus and somatic embryo. In addition, the mixture of embryogenic callus and somatic embryo also synthesized fatty acid and lipids (52.751%) which was higher than non-embryogenic callus (24.789%). Based on the result, the mixture of embryogenic callus and somatic embryo could produce secondary metabolites, such as alkaloid, terpenoid subtances, and phenol.

Physalisangulata known as mullaca, has been widely studied for its pharmacological activities such as antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, and also inhibition of organ rejection in transplantation. This study was directed to investigate the activities of P. angulata extract as an immunomodulatory agent. P. angulata powder was extracted by maceration with 70% of ethanol. An animal model of lupus was obtained by an injection 0.7\u00a0mL of pristane, i.p. Successful induction obtained in two weeks after injection which can be monitored by measuring total leukocyte count. For ensuring successful induction, another test was done four weeks and eight weeks after injection by detecting the presence of specific antinuclear antibodies using SDS PAGE method. Other measured parameters were including nonspecific immune response (measurement of total leukocyte count and differential leukocyte count), specific humoral immune response (hemagglutination test), specific cellular immune responses (delayed type hypersensitivity test), organ index and histology of kidney and spleen. As the results shown, ethanolic extract of Physalisangulata at dose of 1000\u00a0mg/kg BW orally, gave immunomodulatory effect in Lupus rat model. The extract worked primarily on specific immune response by lowering immune response near to the normal value, it was not suppressing immune response as prednisone.",

     "abstract": "Functionalization of carbon surfaces was first carried out in electrode pre-treatments under drastic electrolysis conditions. As a result of these treatments, the electrode carbon surfaces were modified without selectivity with a wide variety of oxygenated functional groups. However, this lack of selectivity was partially overshot with some electrochemical strategies of covalent immobilization, such as the reduction of aryldiazonium, arylsulfonium and iodonium salts, the oxidation of amines, alkynes and arylacetates. In a variant of these direct methods, the oxidation of the carbon surfaces in presence of alcohols and alkyltrimethylsilanes has also been developed. This sort of derivatization has opened the possibility to incorporate a wide variety of functional groups according to the desired applications. In the majority of these methods, reactive intermediates such as organic free radicals and carbocations are generated, which react with the sp2 carbon atoms of the surface to produce covalently modified electrodes. In the particular case of the oxidation process of carboxylates, the loss of carbon dioxide is accompanied with the formation of free radicals and by analogy, it is proposed in this work that other organic anions are also susceptible to be oxidized to yield free radicals that could be covalently attached to carbon electrodes.",

The aim of this research is therefore an investigation of the ratio of silicon dissolved forms in organic-rich waters depending on the silicon concentration and the acidity of the water. The study of pH influence on silicic acids and a silicon\u2013humic matter interaction was carried out using model solutions and natural bog waters (Tomsk region). It has been found that the degree of polymerization of silicic acids essentially depends on the acidity of a solution. Scanning of spectrophotometric measurements has shown that silicon does not form stable complexes with fulvic and humic acids in weak-acid media (\u0440\u041d 3-4).

The pesticides were completely destroyed following pseudofirst-order kinetics estimated according to chemical oxygen demand (COD) data and phosphate ions accumulation. The assessment of decay rate constants shows the high mineralization degree. Moreover, the general current efficiency corresponds to high impact of chemical reactions in the bulk along with electrochemical interactions and defines the reasonable treatment process time as 120\u00a0min. The decay rate constants obtained by phosphate formation are higher for glyphosate than rate constants estimated by COD. It may be explained by P\u2013C bond breaking and phosphate ions cleavage.

     "abstract": "Energy crisis is what being faced by every country today. Many efforts have been devoted to overcome the problems. One of several offered solutions is to develop solar cells (SCs) since solar energy is abundant and free to use. Especially in a tropical country like Indonesia, solar energy is available a whole year with quite high power 450\u00a0mWcm-2. Several types of SCs, especially silicon-based, have been mass-produced and applied in our daily life. Silicon-based SC has high efficiency yet has high price. Dye Sensitized Solar Cell is an inexpensive type of SC. The natural ingredients could be utilized as dyes for DSSC. In this research, tamarillo extract was employed as the dye for TiO2-based DSSC. TiO2 powder was spin-coated on top of Fluorine- Doped Tin Oxide (FTO) conductive glass and calcined at 550 \u030aC, 650 \u030aC and 750 \u030aC each for 60 and 120\u00a0min. Scanning ElectronMicroscope (SEM) and X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) were used to characterize the morphology and structure of the material. Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) analysis was utilized to measure the material active surface area. As the result, the sample calcined at 650 \u030aC for 60\u00a0minutes showed the highest electrical performance of 542.5\u00a0mV and 0.356\u00a0mAcm-2 which corresponded to an SC efficiency of 0.043%. This result was supported by the BET analysis showing the sample calcined at 650 \u030aC for 60\u00a0min had the largest active surface area of 9.3 m2g-1. A large active surface area enabled more dye and electrolyte to be stored inside the material so that photon adsorptions from solar energy became more effective and resulting in higher efficiency. Despite of the small efficiency, this work demonstrated the opportunities of tamarillo and TiO2 to be applied as a DSSC.",

     "abstract": "This study aimed at the development of antimicrobial (AM) packaging based on wheat starch incorporated with chitosan and lauric acid as antimicrobial agents. A series of blends with different ratio of starch, chitosan and lauric acid (S:C:LA) were prepared by casting method. Effects of incorporation of antimicrobial agents into starch-based film were investigated in order to improve the spectrum activity based on measured distributions of inhibitory results. The diffusivity equation approach for describing the antimicrobial effects was also extended to include information about the molecular size of particles in the formed matrices. The Agar Disc Diffusion Assay and Liquid Culture Test measure the distributions of inhibitory effect towards type of bacterial contamination in terms of Gram-positive, Gram-negative and their combination of wider spectrum activity in the blend films. For the first time, the inhibition size distribution resulting from rationing of base polymers and lauric acid as filler in the starch-base film itself was quantified. Spectrum activity of different Gram-stained bacteria as measured by the bacterial growth inhibition, gave surprisingly consistent pattern on rationing of compositions in the film. This indicates that the spectrum activity produced by the antimicrobial components can be related directly to the ratio on blending during film preparation. This phenomenon is proven by dominating of chitosan (S:C:LA ratio 1:9:0.08 to 3:7:0.24) for 48% increase of effective E. coli inhibition (Gram-negative bacteria). More positively, however, it signifies that the affinity of lauric acid towards starch as reported by previous researches indicates relatively unambiguously the ratio required to achieve a constant degree of B. subtilis (Gram-positive) bacterial inhibition from starch/lauric acid dominating of S:C:LA ratio at 4:6:0.32 to 7:3:0.56. Furthermore, S:C:LA ratio 8:2:0.64 and 9:1:0.72 showed good synergic inhibition of 54% higher relative to sole chitosan towards both bacteria. Further studies of antimicrobial effects investigated the mode of release from the base film. The release of lauric acid in fatty acid food stimulant was satisfactorily expressed by Fickian-diffusion mechanism described by zero order kinetics which indicated that lauric acid released from the film matrix remains constant over time.",

     "abstract": "Biopolymer active packaging is known to have low mechanical strength and highly brittle. Regardless to its disadvantage, polymers from natural sources have attracted serious attention since the non-renewable sources for example petroleum, the major precursor of plastic manufacturing become depleted. Starch-Chitosan for instance is a hybrid film that entirely green as it produced from a renewable material and totally degradable. The addition of chitosan in film packaging able to kill pathogen hence increases the food shelf life. Through nanotechnology advance, nanomaterial can be used for material reinforcement. Nowadays, greener approach could be applied by incorporating natural cellulose nanofiber into the film matrix. Oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) fiber that rich of cellulose contents could be treated chemically to purify the cellulose in the fiber. Cellulose fiber obtained was cut to a nano-size using acid hydrolysis. Transmission Electron Microscopy (T.E.M) obtained shown the nanofiber size was ranged between 1-100\u00a0nm in diameter. Nanocomposite film formulation, was constructed by varying the cellulose nanofiber incorporation between 2-10% per weight of starch. The strength of the films was measured as well as antimicrobial properties. The addition of 2% cellulose nanofiber into the film matrix exhibits high tensile strength with 5.25\u00a0Mpa compared to starch-chitosan hybrid film with 3.96\u00a0Mpa. However, no significant improvement in tensile strength was distinguished beyond that ratio. Antimicrobial analysis shows that the addition of cellulose nanofiber could increase the inhibition effect towards gram-positive bacteria but not towards gram-negative bacteria. The addition of 2% cellulose nanofiber increased the inhibition diameter towards gram positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis up to 33%. However, inhibition towards Bacillus subtilis decreased with the incorporation of more cellulose nanofiber. In gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, the addition of cellulose nanofiber does not give significant effect to bacterial. In General, the addition of the unique structure of cellulose nanofiber in the starch based polymer system could enhance the mechanical strength of the film and increase the inhibition of the gram positive bacteria.",

Therefore, the toxicity of ILs should be assessed in order to prevent their harm to human and environment.

Three ILs have been tested, which are 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide toward marine fish and 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide toward freshwater fish. Two different marine fish were employed, which are: Cephalopholis cruentata (grouper) and Lates calcarifer (barramundi). For freshwater fish, male Poecilia reticulate (guppy) was employed. The toxicity tests were conducted according to OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) guideline 203. For 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulphate [BMIM][HSO4], the median lethal concentration (LC50) estimated toward Cephalopholis cruentatato be 199.98\u00a0mg.L-1.

All the LC50 values obtained can be identified as practically nontoxic liquids based on Acute Toxicity Rating Scale by Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). As to our knowledge, there is no previous reported toxicity studies of [BMIM][HSO4] and [BMIM][TFSI] on marine fish and [HMIM] [NTf2] on freshwater fish.

Strawberry fruit have a relatively high content of vitamin C, which is around 40-70\u00a0mg/ 100\u00a0g strawberries. However, vitamin C which is also known as ascorbic acid is easily degraded during storage. The objective of this research is to study the kinetics of degradation of vitamin C in fresh strawberry juices upon storage and to investigate the effect of storage temperatures and sugar addition on the ascorbic acid loss in strawberry juices. Four different types of fresh strawberry juices were prepared, namely A, B, C, and D. Juices A and C were stored at a room temperature of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, while samples B and D were stored at a refrigerated temperature of 8\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, juices A and B were prepared without sugar addition, while sugar was added to juices C and D. The concentration of ascorbic acid in the juice was analyzed using iodimetric titration method. It was monitored every one hour for 8\u00a0hours of storage for the kinetics of ascorbic acid degradation study. The results showed that the degradation reaction of vitamin C followed zero-order kinetic models in all types of juices. The degradation reaction rate constants obtained for juices A, B, C, and D were 4.42; 3.63; 2.32; and 1.85\u00a0mg vitamin C/(100\u00a0ml. h), respectively. The activation energy for the vitamin C degradation in fresh strawberry juices with sugar and without sugar addition was estimated to be 1.90\u00a0kcal/ mol and 1.65\u00a0kcal/ mol, respectively. In conclusion, the storage at a lower temperature combined with sugar addition could effectively slow the rate of degradation of vitamin C.",

     "abstract": "It is well recognized that calcium carbonates (CaCO3) is one of the main components of scale that is commonly encountered in chemical and related industries. The calcium carbonate scale often grows extensively on equipment and parts, causing major operational difficulties. This paper presents experiments on calcium carbonate scale formation and control in a piping system where the scale-forming solution flowed in a laminar manner: 30, 40, and 50\u00a0mL/min, respectively. Other parameters evaluated were: solution temperature (25, 30 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C), and concentrations of malic acid (C4H6O5) added as impurities (3.00 and 5.00\u00a0ppm). The scale-forming solution was made by mixing equimolar solutions of CaCl2 and Na2CO3, respectively. The scale formation process was monitored by measuring the conductivity of the solution coming out of the piping system. It was found that in all experiments, conductivity decreased abruptly after a certain induction period, during which time the conductivity remained steady. The induction period varied from 17\u00a0min to 34\u00a0min, which means that the scale starts forming 17\u00a0min to 34\u00a0min after the mixing of the solution. Higher flow rates resulted in more calcium carbonate scale mass, which indicate that the fluid flow enhances the scale formation. Similarly, increasing the temperature of the solution (25, 30, and 40\u00a0\u00b0C) resulted in the increase of the scale mass. Overall, higher malic acid concentrations resulted in longer induction time and less scale mass. Depending on the temperature and the malic acid concentration tested, the reduction in scale mass could be \u2265 200%. This drastic reduction in scale mass suggests that malic acid could be an effective anti-scalant for calcium carbonate scale. SEM imaging and its associated EDS analysis confirmed that the scale formed corresponds to that of calcite (CaCO3). The X-ray diffraction analysis of the scale showed that the scale consisted of crystalline matter which corresponds to the powder diffraction data for calcium carbonate. The addition of malic acid in trace amounts (0.00 to 5.00 ppm) was able to alter the morphology of the scale crystals, indicating the preference adsorption of malic acid on specific crystal surface.",

The equilibrium activation energy (\u0394Ev,b) is evaluated according to the corresponding drying air humidity and temperature. This is combined with the relative activation energy (\u0394Ev/\u0394Ev,b), generated from one accurate drying run to produce the activation energy, which describes the internal behavior of the samples during drying. A good agreement between experimental and predicted data is observed. The REA is shown to perform comparable or even better than the classical diffusion-based model.

This study is the first stage of ongoing 3 years project to isolate and quantify the antioxidant content in the fruit of Phaleria macrocarpa, which possessed higher antioxidant activity than berry fruits, especially for natural food preservative application. In particular, the optimum condition for the extraction process using methanol was the main purpose of this study. The raw material pretreatment (drying) method prior to extraction was also investigated. The bioactivity of the extract obtained from each method was then compared to commercial dried P. macrocarpa by phytochemical screening methods. Tray and air drying methods resulted in the most complete phytochemical content followed by sun drying, in which the alkaloid were lost. Commercial dried P.macrocarpa showed similar phytochemical contents with sun drying specimen, but with additional lost of saponin compounds. The antioxidant contents were measured as DPPH equivalencies which showed tray drying method had the best antioxidant activity of 0.200\u00a0\u03bcmol DPPH/mg (dry basis), followed by air drying and sun drying of 0.117 and 0.037\u00a0\u03bcmol DPPH/mg (dry basis), respectively. Two important extraction process parameters were optimized using central composite experimental design by varying operation temperatures from 35 to 50\u00a0\u00b0C and F:S (g/mL) ratio from 1:20 to 1:50. The response surface analysis showed a maximum response point (F:S=0.02 and T= 50\u00a0\u00b0C), at which the highest antioxidant content (yield) of 0.3234\u00a0\u03bcmol DPPH/mg dry basis could be achieved.",

     "abstract": "The oxalates content has caused limited utilizations of taro (Colocasia esculenta) as a food material. The insoluble oxalates, especially needle like calcium oxalate crystal may cause irritation, and swelling of mouth and throat. Removal of oxalates in food can be done by physical processes, such as soaking, boiling, and cooking or chemical process by converting them into soluble phases. The purpose of this research were to investigate the effects of baking soda concentration (0-10% w/w) and temperatures (70-97\u00a0\u00b0C) on the reduction of calcium oxalate content in the taro corm chips and to develop a kinetic model of that process during boiling in baking soda solution. The kinetic model development was done by considering the dissolution of calcium oxalate, chemical reaction and thermal degradation that take place during boiling. The experimental results showed that increasing of baking soda concentration and temperatures were found to increase the reduction of calcium oxalate in the taro corm chips. Based on the product's functional properties, the best condition for calcium oxalate reduction was soaking in 10% w/w baking soda solution for 2\u00a0hours followed by boiling at 90\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0minutes. The kinetic modeling concluded that the calcium oxalate reduction was found to follow a pseudo first order reaction. The modeling results showed that the model is able to represent the phenomena quite well with the apparent reduction rate constant, k = 15.77 Exp (21.239)/RT minute-1.",

The effect of the presence of emulsifier triethanolamine (TEA) was also examined. Sensory analyses were conducted to monitor the changes in color, texture, and aroma. The results showed that coated banana fruit demonstrated delayed ripening processes compared to the uncoated banana. This also confirmed by the reduction in weight loss as well as in vitamin C loss in comparison to the uncoated banana. Weight loss and vitamin C loss decreased with increasing chitosan concentration and degree of deacetylation of chitosan.

The bottom ash was pretreated with 1\u00a0N HCl, 1\u00a0N HNO3, and 30% H2O2 before the adsorption tests. Adsorption of the pretreated bottom ash has been studied as a function of particle size, contact time, initial solution pH, and initial solution concentration. The ability to adsorb reactive dye (in terms of percentage dye removal) of these chemical treated bottom ashes are not significantly different. The adsorption reached an equilibrium state at about 15\u00a0hours from the beginning of the experiments. The adsorption capacity at the equilibrium state increased as the size of the particles decreased. This was due to the increase in surface area of the adsorbents. The maximum adsorption occurred at the initial solution pH lower than 2 for all adsorbents with the highest percentage of dye removal and the highest amount dye adsorbed of 75.8 and 0.1\u00a0mg/g adsorbents, respectively, for the H2O2 treated bottom ash. With varying the initial solution concentrations, the results showed that the adsorption capacity decreased as the initial solution concentration increased which was limited by the amount of the adsorbents in the system.

     "abstract": "Global crisis of clean water supply has attracted great attention to reuse and recycle wastewater effluent. However, the effort has been limited by the presence of toxic organics in the effluent which in turn inhibits the public acceptance of recycling water. The existence of those organic pollutants, which cannot be eliminated by conventional primary and secondary treatment processes, can be problematic. Photocatalysis offers a promising process by breaking down low-level organic pollutants in water into nontoxic compounds such as CO2, H2O and mineral acids. The process involves excitation of a photocatalyst with near UV (300\u2013400\u00a0nm) light to promote the formation of highly reactive chemical species such as holes, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radical anions that are capable to mineralize the organic pollutants. An extensive variety of compounds can be satisfactorily degraded such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, aromatics, dyes, natural organic matters, etc.The study shows the promising application of photocatalysis to treat water and wastewater with a series of organic compounds of carboxylic acids and alcohols was selected as the substrate model. The products resulted from the mineralization of the substrates have been identified and the effect of the formation of those intermediates to the overall mineralization rate has been discussed. The results showed the mineralization rates were greatly influenced by molecule structure of organics being degraded. For dicarboxylic acid group, the presence of hydroxyl functional groups increases the residence time of a carboxylate anion adjacent to the hydroxyl group and thus, rapid mineralization rate was observed. For alcohols, only one hydroxyl group attached to the surface and hence, the relative slow mineralization was recorded in the system. It can be concluded that the surface approach of the organic molecule determines the type of intermediates formed and thus, its overall mineralization rate.",

Pyrolysis, a thermochemical conversion process under oxygen-absent condition is an attractive way to convert biomass into bio- oil.In this study, the pyrolysis experiments were carried out ina fixed-bedreactor at a range of temperature of400-600\u00a0\u00b0C, heating rate range between 10-50\u00a0\u00b0C/min, and a range of nitrogen flow between 2-4litre/min. The aims of this work were to explore the effects of pyrolysis conditions and to identify the optimum condition for obtaining the highest bio-oil yield.The effect of nitrogen flow rate and heating rate on the yield of bio-oil were insignificant. The most important parameter in the bio-oil production was the temperature of the pyrolysis process.The yield of bio-oil initially increased with temperature (up to 550\u00a0\u00b0C) then further increase of temperature resulting in the decreased of bio-oil yield. Results showed that the highest bio-oil yield (52.6%)wasobtainedat 550\u00a0\u00b0C with nitrogen flow rate of 4L/min and heating rate of 50\u00a0\u00b0C/min. The thermal degradation of jackfruit peel was also studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Gas chromatography (GC-MS) was used to identify the organic fraction of bio-oil.

The objectives of this research were to study an effect of biobased-catalyst which is used as supporting catalyst in simultaneous ozonolysis and transesterification for biodiesel synthesis and to study the effect of two steps process in biodiesel synthesis. The bio-based catalyst used in this process was empty palm bunch ash which was used as supporting catalyst for KOH. Two steps reaction were designed, the first step was run in a reactor at 30\u00a0\u00b0C with a continuous supply of ozone gas for 3\u00a0hours to cleave the unsaturated fatty acids at the double bonds. The second step was a follow up process after the first step without a supply of ozone gas, the temperature was increased up to 60\u00a0\u00b0C and the reaction continue for two hours. The second step aimed to convert saturated fatty acid which was not yet fully converted at the first step. Results of this study showed that 1.5% of KOH gave better performance in producing short chain methyl esters compared to 1% of KOH in the first step process at various percent weight of ash. The highest short chain methyl esters and long chain methyl esters produced in the first step process were 85.722\u00a0mg/liter and 655.286\u00a0mg/liter respectively, which was used 17.3 weight % ash and 1.5 weight % KOH. Short chain methyl esters were produced as a result of unsaturated fatty acid cracked by ozonolysis. It is confirmed that a simultaneous ozonolysis and transesterification occurred in the first step process. In conclusion, the presence of bio-based catalyst as supporting catalyst for KOH to produce higher total methyl esters has been effective. The second step process in this experiment was not effective since the effect of reaction time can enhance the hydrolysis of esters as a reverse reaction of transesterification, resulted in loss of esters.",

Five kinds of fatty acids in palm oil (palm fatty acids), namely myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid were used as substrates. The reactivity of palm fatty acids was studied at 533\u00a0K in a semi-batch reactor system to produce variety of fatty acid methyl esters namely methyl myristate, methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, methyl oleate and methyl linoleate.

     "abstract": "Torrefaction refers to a thermochemical treatment that reduces the moisture content of biomass and increases its energy density by removing water and lower energy volatiles. Torrefaction process requires mild treatment temperature between 200 to 300 \u02daC in the absence of oxygen (inert atmosphere). Through torrefaction, biomass transformed into a char-like solid with higher value than the raw biomass. Industries found it applicable for the torrefied biomass to be co-fired with coal in power plants because of the close similarity in properties. The torrefied biomass can also be used as feedstock for entrained-flow gasifier, or for residential heating. During torrefaction, a continuous supply of nitrogen to create the needed inert state incurs certain cash flow to the torrefaction plant; meanwhile the nitrogen price is depending on the volatile prices of natural gas that is currently suffered from depletion. The alternative of this problem is to utilize flue gas as a replacement of the nitrogen in parallel with the fact that nitrogen is a major composition of flue gas. A fundamental study is needed to support the idea, for that reason this paper studied how the behaviour of torrefaction diverged when the process was carried out in the presence of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The chosen biomass is oil palm kernel shell (PKS) due to its abundance in Malaysia. The torrefactionis carried out 250 \u02daC for30\u00a0min. In comparison to the solid yield of torrefied PKS in inert torrefaction, the solid yield in oxygen and carbon dioxidetorrefactionis practically unaffected by the non-inert gases. Liquid yield is almost similar in each torrefactioncondition;however the gas yield in carbon dioxide torrefaction is produced intensely compared to the gas yield in oxygen torrefaction.",

     "abstract": "Gum removal from vegetable oils applied for diesel fuel is an essential process, since the presence of gum in direct use to the diesel engine might cause plugging in the engine filters, lines and injectors. In the biodiesel production, the use of crude vegetable oils without degumming might decrease conversion rate and hard to separate glycerol from biodiesel, during and after trans-esterification reaction respectively. Ultrafiltration is potential technology for degumming of crude vegetable oils, however since the oil constituents have nearly close molecular weight, the membrane degumming process is a difficult process. In order to understand the membrane degumming process in corn-oil, both experimental and computational works have been conducted. Dry degumming process of corn-oil has been carried out using a tubular ceramic membrane, and the effects of process conditions (temperature, trans-membrane pressure, cross flow velocity) and concentration polarization were investigated. Computational fluid dynamics simulation based on Galerkin finite element methods (FEM) has been carried out and used to predict the retention layer occurred during inside-out operation of membrane degumming. The numerical results show that the increasing of crossflow velocity lead to increase axial Reynolds number, and on the other hand decrease the thickness of the retention layer. In the x/R=1.0 position, the retention layer thicknesses were \u03b4p= 4.0x10-4 m and \u03b4p= 1.7x10-4 m, for Re=1000 and Re=10000, respectively. Moreover, the effect of increasing Schmidt number gives a significant retention layer thickness decline, i.e. from \u03b4p= 4.8x10-4 m to \u03b4p= 2.2x10-4 m, by using Sc=4x105 to Sc=1.3x106, respectively. The Schmidt numbers depends on the diffusion behavior of solute in the solvent, and has been concluded that wet-degumming process was a better method to prevent higher concentration polarization close to the membrane wall.",

This slightly different biopolymer is more reactive than chitin, being more effective for many applications in fields as environmental remediation, biomedical sciences, catalysis and so on. The main process for chitin deacetylation used sodium hydroxide solutions at high temperatures for long times to obtain chitosan with high deacetylation degree (DD). The present study has evaluated the effect from room temperature (RT), 363 and 393\u00a0K, hydroxide concentration (2.0 or 10.0\u00a0mol dm3) and time (3 and 24\u00a0h) on shrimp chitin deacetylation. Similar amounts of chitin and sodium hydroxide solutions were stirred jointly and the resultant solids were filtered and washed until pH 7, than dried at environmental conditions. The obtained samples were characterized by several techniques, such as elemental analysis, X-rays diffraction (XRD), laser scattering and absorption spectroscopy at infrared region with Fourier transform (FTIR), which was used for DD calculation. The results showed that all chitin-chitosan samples did not reach DD > 90%, as observed for some good commercial chitosans. The highest DD was obtained by the sample prepared at more drastic conditions, as expected, however the higher sodium hydroxide concentration leads to decrease of molecular mass when associated with high temperatures. The crystallinity was influenced mostly by reaction time, which change the positions and intensities as indicated by XRD main peaks, located at 9.3 and 19.4\u00b0 2\u0398. Particle sizes were strongly diminished by treatment at 393\u00a0K, what imply also some increase at the pressure, favoring chain dissociation reactions.

     "abstract": "One of the major causes of death is coronary heart disease which is usually caused by hypercholesterolemia. HMG-CoA reductase is a rate-limiting enzyme that plays important role in cholesterol biosynthetis. The enzyme acts a prime target for pharmacology intervention. Monacolin K is known as an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. It was produced as a fungal metabolite either from Monascus sp. or Aspergillus terreus strain. The compound had been proven to be anticholesterol and antihypotensive agent. Red Yeast Rice or angkak is a traditional food that fermented by Monascus sp. Traditional form of angkak resulting specific smell and taste. Extraction of angkak will make a better form with more acceptance by consumer. During extraction process, the type of organic solvent and temperature are critical factor for compound extraction. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ethanol concentration and temperature in Monacolin K extraction process from Monascus Fermented Rice (MFR). Investigation of extraction process was carried out using variable of ethanol concentration i.e. 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 95% (v/v). The effect of temperature during extraction was also investigated through two condition i.e. room temperature and 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The amount of Monacolin K, which contained in crude extract, was measured using spectrophotometric and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. The results showed that the highest amount of Monacolin K in crude extract was found in extraction using 95% v/v of ethanol (MFR95) whereas effect of heating procedure also showed that the amount of Monacolin K in crude extract was increased in 60\u00a0\u00b0C. HPLC analysis showed that the yield of Monacolin K in crude of MFR95 extract was 1760\u00a0\u03bcg g-1. In conclusion, ethanol 95% v/v and heated in 60\u00a0\u00b0C were the best choice for extraction of Monacolin K from MFR.",

     "abstract": "Rubber seeds are side products of rubber trees. Rubber seeds contain 40-50% non-edible oil that can be used as industrial materials to produce variety of products such as linoleum, lubricant, cutting oil, alkyd resin, biodiesel, etc. To obtain oil from rubber seeds, there are two common methods that can be used, i.e. solvent extraction and mechanical pressing. Solvent extraction method uses solvent such as hexane to extract oil from rubber seeds. This method gives a higher yield compared to mechanical pressing method. However, since solvent is used in this method, it may reduce the quality of the oil. Mechanical pressing method gives a lower yield but simpler to do and gives a higher quality of oil. One of mechanical pressing machine usually used is hydraulic press. The objective of this research is to study the effects of temperature, pressure, preheating time and pressing time on rubber seed oil yield. Rubber seeds that had been cleaned, dehulled, dried, and flaked until the flakes are about 0.5-0.8\u00a0mm, are preheated at 60-80\u00a0\u00b0C for 45-75\u00a0minutes. Then, while the rubber seed flakes get further heated, the flakes are pressed for 30- 90\u00a0minutes at 80-120\u00a0bar. The effects of temperature, pressure, preheating time, and pressing time on rubber seed oil yield are then evaluated using a 24 factorial design with 4 center points. The analysis of variance shows that pressure, pressing time and their interaction have significant effects on rubber seed oil yield. From experiment, the best condition that gives the highest rubber seed oil yield is at the highest pressure (120\u00a0bar) and the longest pressing time (90\u00a0minutes) which corresponds to 31.88% oil yield.",

     "abstract": "One of the major goals in the field of rehabilitation and renovation of existing structures is to determine mechanical properties of materials as well as their level of damage, namely the presence of defects, cracks, weathering effects, etc., by means of non-destructive (NDT) techniques. NDT tests, in fact, are easier and more economics than destructive ones because they do not necessitate sample extraction and preparation; furthermore they are often the unique way to assess the material properties in case of historic and architectural buildings, where the possibility of extracting core samples is limited or not possible. The ultrasonic pulse velocity testing has been proved to be a useful and reliable non-destructive test for assessing the compressive strength and the elastic modulus of concrete in existing structures. Furthermore, the use of both ultrasonic tests and Schmidt hammer tests allow to have a good estimation of concrete compressive strength (SONREB method) by reducing the influence of the variables affecting the two technique when used alone. Both the technics have also been suggested to investigate mechanical and physical properties of rocks, but further experimental data are needed to confirm the reliability of the method. The present work is a part of a wider research aimed at set up non-invasive diagnostic procedures for the mechanical analysis and qualification of the ancient masonries; it is specifically devoted to verify the effectiveness and/or to point out critical aspects and limits of the above mentioned non-destructive tests - already applied in the field of concrete and compact stones -with reference to the characterization of soft stones.",

All the standards were analysed by Visible Reflectance Spectrometry, building up a specific database of reference spectrophotometric curves. Besides, every standard was analysed by XRF analysis and multispectral techniques to implement the database itself.In this paper an extract from the database and some case-studies, among the most interesting and complex ones, will be presented, highlighting the importance of an integrated use of different non-invasive techniques for the identification of pigments and mixtures.",

In the meantime the research has continued on ceramics and the results are reported in the present edition of YOCOCU.

These concretions can hide significant decoration details and obscure the historical, social and artistic values of an ancient object but their removal could be harmful to the object itself and are also the cause of their state of conservation.

     "abstract": "Setbacks are an often-unacknowledged reality of conservation practices. This paper examines various types of setbacks, shortcomings, and mistakes in conservation practice, including unsuccessful treatments, errors in judgment, and the limits of intervention. While it may be tempting for a young conservator to anticipate these types of experiences as\u2019failures,\u2019 we argue that these situations provide opportunities for growth and development. While a senior professional may readily recognize the value in setbacks and contextualize them by drawing upon their past experiences, we seek to explore the ways in which a less seasoned practitioner may productively reinterpret or re-evaluate such situations in terms of our expectations, achievements, and sense of personal responsibility. Categories of setbacks will be illustrated with specific examples from personal experiences and those of our cohort-at-large as pre-program trainees and students.This project was first inspired by the attempted re-treatment of a ceramic object during the Fall of 2011 at the UCLA/Getty Conservation Training Program. While the objectives of the assigned exercise were unmet \u2014 the object was returned to the lending institution in the same condition that it arrived at our training labs\u2014 the student learned appreciably about the effects of material degradation, the decision-making process for designating an object as un-treatable, and the ethical considerations such conclusions require. Further examples of setbacks include errors in judgment \u2014 such as removing original polychromy by wheeling a tall, wooden sculpture into a low doorframe \u2014 and a lack of self-awareness with drastic consequences for object safety when a ceramic figure was knocked off a table as a result of fatigue. By reflecting on and discussing the setbacks we encounter as inexperienced conservators, it is possible to glean lessons about our limitations and expectations of conservation practices, and to integrate these into our evolving working methods. Strategies for re-evaluating these experiences include viewing them in terms of their positive role in developing long-term goals and practical methodologies as well as promoting a non-punitive and professional culture of honesty, humor, and acceptance. We hope that our attitude will help establish, in the words of Marincola and Maisey (2011), \u2019a more fruitful learning culture\u2019 for the benefit of both the field of conservation and its mission to protect and preserve historic and artistic materials.",

The effects of the different procedures on the original surfaces were evaluated by a scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDS) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and colour measurements. Results prove that microbial cleaning is the most controllable process and it has a great efficiency in sulphate removal. These techniques have also a great ecological importance as bacteria reproduce the same biological process achieved in natural contests.",

This paper focuses on some examples of degraded organ pipes coming from several parts of Sicily (the biggest island of the Mediterranean Sea) characterized by different environmental and climate conditions typical for the Mediterranean area. Investigation on the specific causes that had produced the degradation was performed by using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy-Dispersive X-ray analysis, (SEM-EDX) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Three different kinds of degradations were found: the formation of tin dioxide blisters on the tin based pipes caused by normal oxidation processes induced by the atmospheric oxygen; another tin oxidation process results in tin chloride phases formation; finally, in the case of lead pipes, the degradation is related to the formation of lead nitrate salts.",

     "abstract": "Rising damp is one of the most recurrent and well-known hazards to existing buildings and monuments. Several types of intervention exist to tackle the problem. Among these, the creation of a damp-proof course against capillary rise by means of injection of chemical products is one of the most diffused methods, thanks to the relatively easy and cheap application. Despite positive results when applied under controlled conditions in laboratory, these interventions do not always deliver the desired result in practice. Several studies have shown varying degrees of success. Various factors, like the lack of homogeneity of the substrate and a high moisture and salt content may affect the effectiveness of treatments. Moreover, the type of substrate and the combination of materials with different pore size distribution influence the spreading and the effectiveness of chemical products. Since rising damp is a problem that is mainly manifested in masonry, that is usually composed of at least two materials, the last factor may be of great importance.The current paper reports the results of a research on the transport of chemical injection products in relatively small mortar/brick combinations. Since no easy to perform test method for small combined specimens, giving results within a short time, was available, a special test method was developed.The effect of the interface between brick and mortar on the transport of the products was studied by the application of several injection products and creams. The tested products include pore filling and water repellent products and products in water as well as in organic solvent.The obtained results show clear differences in spreading and effectiveness in the different substrates and between products in organic solvent and water based ones, as well as between creams and liquid products. The results show that water based products can easily be transported through the mortar joint, differently from what occurs with products in an organic solvent. This is the consequence of the different transport mechanisms of water based products and products in organic solvent in water filled pores.",

This research aims at determining how lighting systems can be standardized and developed, by studying the interaction between light and the materials constituting cultural heritage. An interesting case-study was considered as starting point: the arsenic sulphides photo-oxidation induced by visible light. In particular, among arsenic sulphides, realgar photo-degradation was studied, as this pigment was used since antiquity. Light transforms realgar (red mineral, As4S4) in arsenolite (white as powder, As2O3) and pararealgar (yellow, As4S4). The process is not completely clarified so far. This study deepens the comprehension of the realgar degradation process and determines the ability of different halogen lamps and a LED lamp, used in museum exhibitions, to induce photodegradation of pigments The study was carried out by means of FT-IR, micro-Raman spectroscopy, XRD and spectra colorimeter analysis.",

The study of a color plan in city centers has been the subject of numerous debates in Italy, particularly in complex cases such as the historic center of Rome. Over the past thirty years also the development of new products for the construction industry has introduced the problem of materials selection and evaluation of their compatibility in historic urban context. By a preliminary analysis of the current legislation it is clear only the definition of general precepts without giving clear rules for the restoration of plasters and colors. Similarly, studying the law on the protection of historic center of Rome it is noted that the regulations avoid repaintings that \u00aboffend the decency\u00bb, not specifying materials, colors and techniques allowed. For examining these problems concerning the restoration of finishing colors our study has considered the front of some historic buildings in the center of Rome both through archival studies and scientific investigations, in order to define the status of the existing degradation of plasters, the stratigraphic sequence of colors applied on the building facade, and if possible, to detect the original color of the masonry. The aim of this study is to compare the results obtained from this survey with the current Plan of protection of the urban image of Rome to highlight the potentials and limits of existing regulations and to better understand the tools to be used for the restoration of historic buildings.",

The study is an interdisciplinary approach carried out by different analysis techniques in order to define the mineral-petrographic composition and highlight the differences among the various samples. Mortars are present in all the walls, except dry ones, as a bedding material and as a coating. The mortars may be regarded as markers for excellence, because they must be prepared at the time of their use, during the construction of the masonry, and cannot be re-used after their hardening and socket. Furthermore, the production of mortars in the past depended on the availability of raw materials in situ thus establishing a strong and direct correlation between the origin and use.The chemical and petrographic study of the subtle differences and composition of the mortar makes it possible to use this material as an excellent timeline if the supply of building materials varies over time. Mortars, for these reasons, play two key roles in archaeological survey: an absolutely priority for the correct determination of the contours of Stratigraphic Units; the role of the typological class very representative and very useful for making comparisons between different parts of the building and connecting between them the activities of the individual site.",

     "abstract": "Historical glass, especially medieval glass, can undergo weathering under the influence of time and environmental conditions. The aim of this investigation was to better understand the processes involved in this natural degradation process by studying artificially altered glass samples prepared for the use of evaluation of conservation methods. Non-durable glass sensors produced by the Fraunh\u00f6fer Institute (type M1.0) were used as a starting material for artificial alteration. These were immersed in acidic (pH = 0, 2, 4) and neutral solutions (1\u00a0h - 8\u00a0h). In a second stage the glass samples were immersed in a 0.5\u00a0M MnCl2 solution (24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h and 72\u00a0h), allowing intrusion of Mn from the solution into the gel layer. The samples were characterized at different stages with reflectance FTIR spectroscopy, \u03bcXRF mapping and \u03bcXANES. All measurements were carried out at ESRF, beamline ID21. Reflectance FTIR spectroscopy measurements were performed in the 800 4000 cm-1 range. Cluster analysis of the resulting maps evidenced the rapid growth of the gel layer in strong acidic conditions. The average spectra for each cluster feature show for the original glass a strong Si-O\u2212 stretching band between 900 and 1000 cm-1, whereas the gel layer could be identified by the increasing Si-O-Si bands around 1100 and 1250 cm-1. \u03bcXRF maps were recorded at different stages of the experiment at energies around the Mn-K edge (6.539 keV) and with a step size of 2 by 2\u00a0\u03bc m. These confirm the leaching of K+ and Ca+2 from the glass and the intrusion of Mn from the solution. Mn was found throughout the entire gel layer, but with a concentration gradient peaking at the surface. XANES point measurements were recorded at various points where Mn was present. No spatial variation was found, but linear combination fitting of the spectra with various Mn reference compounds indicated that Mn2+Mn3+2 O4 is the main Mn compound in the gel layer, as was hypothesised by Watkinson et al. The standard corroded glass samples studied here can be used for the evaluation of conservation treatments in follow-up experiments.",

Restoration, as everything else, has changed according to trends, mainly guided by the release of new products and technologies, an experimental field where scientific assessment of suitability, efficacy and durability pre-evaluations of treatments are not always conducted. Some efforts have been made to solve this problem in the architectural field, where functional needs and technical requirements force to set clear standards.

In this study the performance of various non-destructive methods for measuring the WAB are compared, with the focus on the effect of the variable factors of the methods caused by their specific design. The methods under study are the contact-sponge method (CSM), the Karsten tube (KT) and the Mirowski pipe (MIR). Their performance is compared with the standardized capillary rise method (CR) and the results are analysed in relation to the open porosity of different lithotypes. Furthermore the effect of practical encumbrances which could limit the application of these methods was valuated. It was found that KT and CSM have complementary fields of investigation, where CSM is capable of measuring the initial water uptake of less porous materials with a high precision, while KT was found commodious for measuring longer contact times for more porous lithotypes. MIR showed too many discommodities, leading to unreliable results. To adequately compare the results of the different methods, the size of the contact area appears to be the most influential factor, whereas the contact material and pressure on the surface do not indicate a significant influence on the results. The study of these factors is currently being extended by visualization of the water adsorption process via X-ray and neutron radiography in combination with physico-mathematical models describing the WAB.",

     "abstract": "The reliable separation of neptunium from dissolved nuclear fuel assumes the ability to maintain a preferred oxidation state. However, regardless of its initial redox speciation, a series of reactions occurs in nitric acid to create a mixture of oxidation states including Np(V), Np(VI) and sometimes Np(IV). To further complicate the situation, irradiated solutions such as fuel dissolution contain both transient and long-lived radiolysis products which may be strongly oxidizing or reducing. Thus, irradiation may be expected to impact the equilibrium distributions of the various neptunium valences.We have irradiated nitric acid solutions of neptunium with 60Co gamma-rays, and measured radiolytically-induced changes in neptunium valences, as well as the nitrous acid concentration, by UV/Vis spectroscopy. It was found that in 4\u00a0M HNO3 at low absorbed doses, the oxidizing radicals oxidized Np(V) to Np(VI). However, as the irradiation proceeded the concentration of nitrous acid became sufficient to reduce Np(VI) to Np(V), and then continued irradiation favored this reduction until an equilibrium was achieved in balance with the oxidation of Np(V) by nitric acid itself. The starting abundances of the two neptunium valences did not affect the final equilibrium concentrations of Np(V) and Np(VI), and no Np(IV) was detected.",

     "abstract": "Repository programs throughout the world have been slowed by the need for increased local public involvement in the siting and licensing process. The result has been an increase in the dry storage of used fuel at reactor sites and the potential that such storage may be extended for many decades, even centuries. While there are sound technical reasons to believe that dry storage can be conducted safely, there are increasing concerns that the ultimate transfer to either a future repository or a centralized separations plant may result in fractured cladding and serious handling issues, including criticality concerns. These concerns would be increased for higher burn-up fuels. Currently, various chemical pre-treatment processes under R&D for application to commercial used oxide fuel have been investigated at the laboratory scale as methods to simplify and increase the safety of the remaining stages of conventional solvent extraction processing. This includes advanced decladding methods and various oxidation/reduction processes designed to release volatile and semi-volatile fission products, produce finely divided uranium oxide powder, and ameliorate the subsequent nitric acid dissolution step. The paper examines the potential for combining several chemical and physical pre-treatment steps to minimize long-term concerns about safe transport of used fuel, possibly providing another option for future nuclear waste management. Laboratory data from both cold and hot testing will provide the basis for the evaluation. An example of a potential pre-treatment process includes shearing, advanced voloxidation and off-gas treatment, the possible mixing of the resulting uranium oxide with a secondary oxide, and densification and recanning in nitric acid-soluble storage containers for extended time periods. Chemical decladding may be feasible to replace shearing. Zirconium recycle may also be feasible, significantly reducing high level waste quantities. Both analytic and experimental data will be applied to the examination of this potential fuel cycle option.",

The feed solution from TRPO process, mainly consisting of 4.4\u00a0M HNO3, \u223c3.7\u00d7108Bq Am-241, 0.02\u00a0M lanthanides, \u223c120\u00a0ppm Mo and 100\u00a0ppm Fe, was pretreated by the following procedures: denitrating to 0.2\u00a0M HNO3 by formic acid, adjusting pH to 2 by 8\u00a0M NaOH, removing most Fe3+ by 0.2\u00a0M Cyanex 301-kerosene cross-flow extraction, and then adjusting pH to 3.5 by 1\u00a0M NaOH. About 5.6\u00d7108Bq Pm-147 was added into the feed solution to trace lanthanides during the experiment. The experiment lasted for 9\u00a0hours with a feed flow rate of 30\u00a0ml/h. The results show that 99.95% Am was separated from lanthanides and only 0.1% lanthanides were extracted together with Am. 99.3% Am and 96.6% Pm were stripped from load Cyanex 301 by 1.0\u00a0M HNO3, respectively.",

This property of TODGA can be exploited for the separation of Y from Sr. The aim of this present work is to produce carrier free 90Y by using Supported Liquid Membrane (SLM) based separation of Y and Sr with TODGA as the carrier. Solvent extraction studies with various diluents viz. 1-decanol, xylene, MIBK, chloroform etc. indicated that xylene and n-dodecane are most suitable as S.F. >50,000 are obtained.

In this study, a tertiary amine (tri-n-octylamine, TOA), which is effective for the extraction of oxoanions, was encapsulated in Ca and H-types of alginate xerogel polymers (CaALG, HALG). The uptake behaviors of TcO4-and ReO4\u2212 (substitute of Tc) in the presence of HNO3 were examined by batch method using TOA-xerogel microcapsules (TOA-CaALG, TOA-HALG). The uptake of TcO4- in the presence of 0.1\u00a0M HNO3 was readily attained within 5\u00a0h, and a relatively large uptake(%) above 90% was obtained. The uptake(%) of Re(VII) for TOA-CaALG in the presence of 0.01\u223c0.1\u00a0M HNO3 was estimated to be about 90%, while gradually decreasing with HNO3 concentration, indicating that the extraction of HNO3 with TOA became dominant in this process: R3NH+NO3 (o) + ReO4 (aq) \u2194 R3NH+ReO4 (o) + NO3 (aq). The order of the uptake(%) for different oxoanions in the presence of 0.01\u223c5\u00a0M HNO3 was Re(VII) > Zr(IV)> Se(VI) > Mo(VI) > Te(VI). The elution study of Tc(VII) revealed 95% and 99% of recovery with 5\u00a0M and 7\u00a0M HNO3, respectively. The chromatographic separation of Re(VII) from simulated HLLW (28 components of waste solution, SW-11E, JAEA) as well as from mixed solution was accomplished by the stepwise elution techniques using a column packed with TOA-MCs. The Re(VII) ions were effectively eluted with 5\u00a0M HNO3, and a relatively large recovery(%) of 98.60% was obtained. Other elements were eluted with H2O and 2\u00a0M HNO3.

The goal is to recover Am up to 99%. The first step mainly consists of splitting americium from curium thanks to the diamide in organic phase combined with a complexing agent in high nitric acid. The low separation factor between Am and Cm leads to a very sensitive process flowsheet towards operating conditions. It is then difficult to manage high recovery yields with good purity. A model has been built taking into account complexation equilibria by TEDGA in aqueous phase and extraction equilibria in organic phase for each element. This model was put into the PAREX code to find the correct flowsheet, and then to conduct sensitivity studies regarding several parameters such as feed flow, acidity, temperature, solvent flow and reagent concentration. These studies have pointed out a high correlation between americium yield and decontamination factor and, also, an equivalence between any change of the most sensitive parameters and a change in TEDGA concentration. A running procedure was followed during two hot tests: the main concept was to start with a less efficient process and then to improve it during the test in order to reach required performances by adjusting the TEDGA flow rate.",

     "abstract": "The sustainability of the current nuclear fuel cycles is not completely achieved since they do not optimise the consumption of natural resource (only a very small part of uranium is burnt) and they do not ensure a complete and efficient recycling of the potential energetic material like the actinides. Promoting nuclear energy as a future energy source requires proposing new nuclear systems that could meet the criteria of sustainability in terms of durability, bearability and liveability. In particular, it requires shifting towards more efficient fuel cycles, in which natural resources are saved, nuclear waste are minimised, efficiently confined and safely disposed of, in which safety and proliferation-resistance are more than ever ensured. Such evolution will require (i) as a mandatory step, evolutionary recycling of the major actinides U and Pu up to their optimized use as energetic materials using fast neutron spectra, (ii) as an optional step, the implementation of the recycling of minor actinides which are the main contributors to the long term heat power and radiotoxicity of nuclear waste. Both options will require fast neutrons reactors to ensure an efficient consumption of actinides. In such a context, the back-end of the fuel cycle will be significantly modified: implementation of advanced treatment/recycling processes, minor-actinides recovery and transmutation, production of lighter final waste requiring lower repository space. In view of the 2012 French milestones in the framework of the 2006 Waste Management Act, this paper will depict the current state of development with regards with these perspectives and will enlighten the consequences for the subsequent nuclear waste management.",

     "abstract": "In the framework of the successive 1991 and 2006 Waste Management Act, French government supported a very significant R&D program on partitioning and transmutation of minor actinides (MA). This program aims to study potential solutions for still minimizing the quantity and the hazardousness of final waste, by MA recycling. Indeed, MA recycling can reduce the heat load and the half-life of most of the waste to be buried to a couple of hundred years, overcoming the concerns of the public related to the long-life of the waste. Within this framework, this paper aims to present the most recent progress obtained in CEA on the development of innovative actinide partitioning hydrometallurgical processes in support of their recycling, either in an homogeneous mode (MA are recycled at low concentration in all the standard reactor fuel) or in an heterogeneous mode (MA are recycled at higher concentration in specific targets, at the periphery of the reactor core). Recovery performances obtained on recent tests in high active conditions of the so-called GANEX and DIAMEX-SANEX process will be presented and discussed in light of the potential P&T scenarios. Finally, recent developments regarding the recycling of the sole Am will be presented as well as the results obtained on highly active solutions for this so-called EXAM process. This set of results gives to the French government a portfolio of potential recycling processes which could be separately and progressively implemented if decided.",

A thorough understanding of the precipitation mechanisms and their interactions with the hydrodynamic conditions prevailing around and inside the drops is essential for the process optimization. In this context, numerical simulations were conducted, accompanying experiments, to study the process sensitivity. Different levels were considered in the modeling task, going from the emulsion behavior inside the column, to the reagents mixing and precipitation within the drops. Regarding the drops scale, on which we focus in this paper, population balance equations (PBE) were coupled to fluid dynamics simulation. Different methods of resolution of the PBE were tested.

This HUP (Hot Uniaxial Press) device is designed specifically to fabricate advanced ceramic Tc-99 bearing waste forms and therefore radiological barriers have been included in the system. The HUP features electronic control and feedback systems to set and monitor pressure, load, and temperature parameters. This device operates wirelessly via portable computer using Bluetoot\u1e27 technology. The HUP device is designed to fit in a standard atmosphere controlled glove box to further allow sintering under inert conditions (e.g. under Ar, He, N2). This will further allow utilizing this HUP for other potential applications, including radioactive samples, novel ceramic waste forms, advanced oxide fuels, air-sensitive samples, metallic systems, advanced powder metallurgy, diffusion experiments and more.",

The sub-critical blanket will last 30 years without reshuffling fuel. Fission products are the only waste that needs disposal. A new dry process called Fission Product Removal (FPR) replaces conventional reprocessing. It is only necessary to remove the cladding, vent the volatiles and pulverize the solids as feedstock for EM2 fuel fabrication. The AIROX (or DUPIC) process is an example of this operation and has been well demonstrated. After removing the fission products from its 30-year discharge, the refabricated fuel is returned to the reactor for another cycle, thereby reducing the need for enrichment and the proliferation resistance would be increased.",

The goal was to determine synthesis conditions of these potential waste forms to immobilize Tc-99 and to harvest crystallographic, thermophysical and hydrodynamic data. Within these studies, Rietveld structure refinement was applied to allow for crystallographic characterization, while a physical property measurement system (PPMS) was used to determine thermophysical properties. The ternary oxides exhibited good crystallinity and their lattice parameters and atomic coordinates could be refined to high accuracy. Low refinement residuals (RBragg) of 2.0, 2.4, and 3.9% were achieved for Nd2Tc2O7, SrTcO3, and Sr2TcO4, respectively.

Sensor selectivity to FMDV is imparted by functionalising the top-surface of specific sensing channels with anti-FMDV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Selective binding of cognate antigens within the test sample to surface-immobilised FMDV mAbs results in localised changes in refractive index within specific sensing channels; these antibody-antigen interactions manifest as increases in wavelength of light reflected from the multi-channel sensor chip (light is coupled into and out of the chip via optical fibres).

This analytical technique has many disadvantages in terms of objectivity and subjectivity. By determining various fruits volatile released during pre-matured until matured period, one can actually selectively establish the exact time of a fruit to ripe. The aromatic volatile compounds emitted by Harumanis mango were analyzed using GCMS and found that terpenes hydrocarbon e.g. limonene, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, \u03b1-terpinene, \u03b3-terpinene and 3-carene are the major volatiles that released by the ripe mango. In this work, MIP (Molecularly Imprint Polymer) based sensor array were fabricated and tuned to mango aroma volatiles. HyperChem software simulation is used to obtain key information such as the Binding Energy (\u0394E) between the template and the functional monomer that lead to the stable MIP. Designing the MIP using HyperChem is an advantage into saving time and cost compare to trial and error experimental methods. Array of different MIPs template e.g. limonene, \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-pinene were synthesis and coated onto the surface of QCMs (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) followed by polymerization and removal of templates molecules that will leave the cavity of selective templates. These QCM arrays are able to distinguish between different terpenes gases released by maturity and ripeness mango due to its selectivity and sensitivity properties of sensor response. The findings of this study is a great breakthrough for the agricultural sector as volatile sensing of chemical markers could determine the optimal harvest time of the local fruits and ensuring the quality and standards.",

A wound infection results in massive release of them which can be detected with impedimetric methods. Our investigations focused on the characterization of the biological process with an in vitro model. The model environment is a cell culture with neutrophil granulocytes cultured on interdigitated electrodes which represent the sensor surface. Detected impedance changes caused by NET-formation were in the range of 35% and even higher. This implies that impedance measurements are suitable for NET detection. We derived a measurement and evaluated it by differing conditions like changing stimulation agent and varying the cell number. For both conditions the results of impedance and phase angle deviation can be confirmed. In combination with other parameters a sensor can be designed for specific detection of wound infections.

This mechanism involves an intramolecular 1,5 hydrogen shift in a 1,3,5,6-tetrachlorohexyl radical. Evidence showing that most of the internal double bonds in PVC are not formed via intermolecular H abstraction from internal monomer units is tentatively rationalized, in part, by hydrogen transfer via at least one cyclic transition state containing more than eight members. The absence of free chlorine atoms from polymerizations of vinyl chloride (VC) is reaffirmed, and the copolymerization of VC with the chloroallylic chain ends of PVC is argued to be insignificant.

One of the reasons for this is due to the shortage of current oil resources and difficulties in finding a new oil field. Indonesia is one of the examples, before 2004 Indonesia is a net oil exporting country but after that Indonesia is a net oil importing country. The oil demand in the country is increasing while the oil production capacity is decreasing. In fact, when a new oil reservoir is drilled, the oil amount obtained from it is about 20-40% of the potential and hence there is still 60-80% oil left in the reservoir. Application of EOR technology gives an additional chance to get out more oil from the reservoir, possibly about another 20%. Polymer is the material that plays an important role in the application of EOR technology, especially surfactant and hydrogel polymers. In the technology, surfactant polymer is injected to the reservoir to reduce an interfacial tension between oil and water and is able to wipe out the trapped oil from the reservoir rock and hence increase the oil production. While an injection of hydrogel polymer to the reservoir is to increase a viscosity of fluid containing water so that the fluid is more difficult to flow than the oil, and as a result, the oil production increases. The most common polymer used for this application is polyacrylamide group.",

     "abstract": "The results of application of microwave (MW) irradiation to achieve refinery of various kinds of recalcitrant biomass were summarized with special emphasis on recent innovative utilization of sensitizers for MW irradiation. The saccharification rates of lignocellulosic plant biomass consisting of softwoods, hardwoods and monocotyledons attained by the simple MW irradiation treatment were in the orders of 35-65% (softwoods), 70-80% (hardwoods) and around 80% (monocotyledons), respectively. The corresponding values of cellulose were around 69-81% (230-240\u00a0\u00b0C), while xylan was susceptible to the MW energy and easily decomposed into oligomers including xylose by heating at >150\u00a0\u00b0C, optimally at 204\u00a0\u00b0C, to give 99% solubility rate. However, the effects of the MW treatment on the agro-food byproducts varied highly depending upon their origins. These results indicate necessity of troublesome specification of the optimum condition for each case. For development of more versatile and comprehensive refinery method we tried to use sensitizers for MW irradiation.We found that hydrogen peroxide was remarkably effective for biomass refinery. Utilization of activated carbon as a sensitizer for MW irradiation was also effective for saccharification of starchy materials. Enhancement of the surface charge of the activated carbons by oxidation and preparation of microwave absorption solid acid catalysts were recommended to further enhance their effectiveness. The overall results showed the importance of four factors, less affinity toward oligosaccharides in relation with pore size, quantity of surface negative charges in addition to electro-conductivity, faster filtration ability and unknown hot spot productivity. Due to removal of the coloured materials by the activated carbons, clear saccharified solution produced by one pot conversion could be directly used for further fermentation to produce biofuels such as ethanol.",

     "abstract": "Biomass has received considerable attention because it is renewable and offers the prospect of circulation of carbon in the ecological system. The concept \u201cBiorefinery\u201d has been developed rapidly in order to establish sustainable industries. Recently, new types of epoxy resins with polyester chains, which can be derived from saccharides, lignin and glycerol, have been investigated. In the above studies, the relationship between chemical structure and physical properties was investigated. In the present review, the features of the preparation system and the action of biomass components in epoxy resin polymer networks are described. The glass transition temperatures of the epoxy resins increased with increasing content of biomass components in epoxy resin polymer networks. Thermal decomposition temperatures were almost constant regardless of the content of biomass components contents in epoxy resins. Mass residue at 500\u00a0\u00b0C increased with increasing contents of biomass components in epoxy resins. It was found that the thermal properties can be controlled by changing the contents of biomass components.",

That is, the polymers with a phospholipid polar group in the side chain, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymers were synthesized. The MPC polymers can inhibit surface-induced clot formation effectively, when they are in contact with blood even in the absence of an anticoagulant. This phenomenon was due to the reduction of plasma protein and suppression of denaturation of adsorbed proteins, that is the MPC polymers interact with blood components very mildly. As the molecular structure of the MPC polymer was easily designed by changing the monomer units and their composition, it could be applied to surface modification of artificial organs and biomedical devices for improving blood and tissue compatibility. Thus, the MPC polymers are useful polymer biomaterials for manufacturing high performance artificial organs and biomedical devices to provide safe medical treatments.",

Addition of layered silicate nanofillers in the polymer matrix has led to improvements in the elastic moduli, strength, heat resistance, decreased gas permeability and flammability. In the present work epoxy modified with Cloisite 30 B\u0308 nanoclay (at 1, 3 and 5 wt% of resin) and E-glass unidirectional fibers are used to prepare fiber reinforced nanocomposites using hand lay-up method. The nanocomposites have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD results show that the interlayer spacing between the clay platelets increased significantly indicating that the polymer is able to intercalate between the clay layers. The mechanical properties are measured by carrying out tensile, hardness and flexural tests and values are compared with those found for fiber reinforced neat epoxy composites. The tests show that an addition of nano-clay up to 3 wt% increases tensile strength and micro-hardness and there is a decrease in values with further clay addition up to 5 wt%. The flexural strength increased significantly with clay loading and the highest value is observed for specimens with 5 wt% of clay. Further, durability studies on nanocomposites have been performed in water and NaOH baths under accelerated hygrothermal conditions. During the exposure it is observed that the degradation in NaOH environment is more severe than in water.",

Glycerol monostearate (GMS) and gum rosin (GR) were used to increase the OLS gallery or intercalation and the temperature stability as it provides an advantage for OLS to ease the exfoliation process. The relationship between OLS and surfactant was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to observe the dispersion of silicate and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) to identify the effect of surfactants. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to prove that the previous surfactant is already substituted. It was found that pretreatment of OLS with sonication using GMS and GR improved the interlayer gallery, and the improvement is getting higher with the increasing of concentration.

The contribution of PVA in nanocomposites was evaluated by measurement of cross-sectional surface, moisture uptake and mechanical properties. Morphological analysis shows that PVA covered a number of cellulosic fibres and formed denser material as a function of PVA addition. Based on the tensile test, the addition of PVA causes a very slight reduction compared with bacterial cellulose itself. The BC/PVA nanocomposites still have similar stiffness to BC with elongation at break less than 5%, while PVA film shows ductile properties with elongation at break more than 80%. On the other hand, the presence of BC fibres in the PVA matrix enhanced the tensile strength and the elastic modulus of pure PVA about two to three times, but it decreased the toughness of pure PVA. The highest tensile strength and elastic modulus of the nanocomposites are 164\u00a0MPa and 7.4\u00a0GPa, respectively at BC concentration of 64%.

The influence of these parameters on the mechanical properties of epoxy/nanoclay/MWNT has been investigated using Taguchi's experimental design. The output measured responses are the tensile properties (tensile modulus, tensile strength and strain at break), impact strength and fracture toughness. From the Analysis of Mean (ANOM) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), MWNT content, pre-cure temperature and cure temperature had the most significant effects for the impact strength with contribution percentages of 38%, 28% and 23% respectively. However, for the fracture toughness and strain at break, the enhancements of properties come from the nanoclay content (59%), MWNT content (18%) and pre-cure temperature (23%). While the improvement in tensile strength was influenced by nanoclay and MWNT content, the cure temperature has a stronger effect on the tensile modulus. In this respect, Taguchi method points to the Taguchi method, in this way, points to the dominant parameters and gives the optimum parameter settings for each mechanical property. Confirmation experiments were performed with the optimum parameter settings and the mechanical properties were measured compared with the predicted results.",

Density analysis, optical observation, moisture content and water absorption study were carried out to evaluate physical properties of BNH fiber. The fiber length and diameter were decreased with the increase of maturity stage from raw to ripe, while the density increased from raw to ripe. Mechanical properties of BNH fiber at different maturity were determined from single-fiber tensile tests where tensile strength, tensile modulus and elongation at break were found varied at each stages of fiber maturity. The difference in tensile strength of raw, ripe and dried BNH fiber is attributed to the structural changes in the plant cell wall during the ripening stage from immature to fully ripening stages. Modulus of natural fiber is also related to the lignin content in the fiber. Water absorption was found to be the highest for raw BNH fiber and the lowest water absorption was observed in dried BNH fiber. Highest moisture content was observed in ripe BNH fiber and the lowest was in dried BNH fiber due to moisture lost during fruit ripening. The diameter of lumen in raw BNH is larger than that of lumen of ripe BNH fiber, while dried BNH fiber showed more compacted structure of fiber.",

Moreover, the incorporation of APP1 and APP2 has a significant effect on the composites degree of crystallinity.

Compared to layered structured clay fibrous clay AT can undergo better dispersion in polymer matrix leading to better improvement in composite properties. Chemical modifications of AT are done through amine treatment as well as by amine+silane treatment to get chemically modified fillers AAT and SAT respectively. In the present investigation, nano composites are prepared using natural rubber (NR) filled with AT, AAT and SAT. Three different loadings of each filler are used namely 2.5, 5, and 10 phr (parts per hundred of rubber). Mechanical properties like tensile strength, elongation at break increase with the increase in filler loading up to 5 phr there after these properties marginally fall when loading is increased to 10 phr due to problem of filler dispersion at higher loading. However, modulus at 300% elongation and tear strength increases with the increase in filler loading up to 10 phr. Very similar trend can also be observed for composites with chemically modified fillers, AAT and SAT. But the degree of reinforcement is higher in the case of AAT and SAT compared to that of unmodified filler AT for the same filler loading. This difference is mainly due to better polymer-filler interaction and filler dispersion in the case of chemically modified clays AAT and SAT compared to unmodified AT. Tear strength of composites increases remarkably with the addition of AT and which is further enhanced when chemically modified clays AAT and SAT are added. Dynamic-mechanical analyses of different clay composites give idea about the difference in the degree of polymer\u2013filler interaction due to chemical treatment of filler.",

In chitosan synthesis, aside from deproteination and deacetylation, demineralization is a crucial step where the major minerals within crustacean shells are removed. This demineralization process is carried out with two parameters, i.e. time and temperature. This research studies the influence of demineralization time on the diameter, tensile properties and biodegradability of chitosan fibers. Chitosan was synthesized from shrimp shells using 1 \u00d7 2\u00a0h and 3 \u00d7 2\u00a0h demineralization process. Chitosan fibers were produced by means of wet spinning. The chemical properties of chitosan fibers were characterized by means of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD) technique. Physical properties characterization was carried out to measure the fibers\u2019 diameter, density and viscosity. Tensile properties were evaluated by means of tensile test. The results were compared to standard of absorbable suture from the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP). Furthermore, in vitro degradation testing was also performed for analyzing biodegradation properties. Chitosan fibers were successfully made with diameter and maximum tensile force of chitosan fibers in a range of 364 - 460\u00a0\u03bcm and 5.6 - 8.3\u00a0N, respectively. The results of this research pointed that adding demineralization time would increase the diameter of chitosan fiber. However, the degradation occurred in prolonged demineralization process broke the bonds within the fiber which lead to a decrease in fiber's density. It is due to the degradation of chitosan occurred during extended demineralization process, which leads to degree of crystallinity reduction. Extensive demineralization process has been found to lower fibers\u2019 tensile strength from 80.4\u00a0MPa to 38.4\u00a0MPa (52.2%), but increase their biodegradability by 17% and maximum elongation from 6.9% to 16.2% (136%). Despite that extensive demineralization process lowered chitosan fiber's tensile strength, both fibers made could still fit the standard for synthetic absorbable suture from USP number 0 and 1.",

In this study, Infrared (IR) thermal imaging technique has been used to detect the defect in unidirectional Kenaf bast fibre reinforced composite materials. IR thermal imaging technique or IR thermography is a surface thermal radiation measurement technique that is used to detect spatial variations in the measured surface temperature pattern. Thermography reveals flaws by searching anomalous hot-spots after thermal excitation. Thermography can be either categorized as active or passive. An active Infrared thermography has been proven to be a viable non-destructive testing for composite structures. In active thermography the surface of a sample is heated using an external heat source and then the surface temperature is monitored. The thermography analyses were verified by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigations. The defect detection accuracy of this technique is 95%.",

The crosslinking process parameters as well as the fluorescence characteristics and the solvent resistance of the resulting films have been investigated. The result shows that the oxidative crosslinking (1) gives the possibility to obtain the doping effect which increases the conductivity of the insoluble layer, although it reduces the fluorescence characteristics. The photo crosslinking (2) is controlled by irradiation; therefore, it gives the possibility to pixelate or pattern the film (lithography). It shows less fluorescence quenching than in (1). The trityl crosslinking (3) is suitable for the devices which are not pixelated and do not need the doping effect. Irradiation is not applicable here. Finally, we applied the insoluble layers in hole-only devices and blue-emitting OLEDs. We found that introduction of the layers improves the efficiency of the OLEDs.",

Corn hominy contains a small amount of fibre (7.26%), protein (10.2%), fat (8.12%), and a large amount of starch (63.21%) which could be used as an alternative source for making starch based thermoplastics (STP), hence reducing the use of starch. The aim of this research is to investigate the effects of weight ratio of tapioca to corn hominy as well as the glycerol content in formula compositions on mechanical properties, i.e. tensile strength and elongation at break and thermal properties (Tg and Tm) of corn hominy based thermoplastic. The ratio of tapioca to corn hominy composition varied from 0:100; 25:75; 50:50; 75:25 and the glycerol content varied from 25% to 35 wt%. The blends were melt processed using counter rotating twin screw mixer with the barrel temperature of 120, 130 and 120\u00a0\u00b0C at 60\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min. It has been observed that using corn hominy as a sole material for making thermoplastic was not feasible. The tensile strength, elongation at break, and glass transition point (Tg) were greatly affected by increasing the tapioca content. Thermoplastics starch produced by extruder was then pressed by a hydraullic press, and this showed good characteristics which signaled by homogenous surface of SEM images. The surface morphology of thermoplastic starch was unchange by increasing the glycerol content and corn hominy ratio. However, higher corn hominy ratio gave smoother surface morphology at the cross section of thermoplastic starch.",

Its conversion into \u03b3-valerolactone (GVL) via hydrogenation and ringclosure to the lactone has been studied as a versatile route to the manufacture of biodegradable polyesters. For hydrogenation of LA using Ru/C catalyst (the first method), conversion of LA at 100% was observed after 50\u00a0min at 90\u00a1C in water, with a GVL selectivity of 73%. The product selectivity may be steered by the temperature. At low temperatures 4-HVA is formed selectively, whereas higher temperatures favour the formation of GVL. Meanwhile in the second method, hydrogenation of LA using biphasic water soluble Ru-TPPTS catalysis made in situ in dichloromethane/water biphasic mixtures showed essentially quantitative GVL yields (82%) at 45\u00a0bar, 90 \u00a1C and 60\u00a0min reaction time (1% mol catalyst). As product of the LA hydrogenation, GVL has a very low reactivity for ring-opening due to a very low ring strain. Several studies therefore focused on GVL ring opening into polymerizable compounds but the results so far are unsatisfactory. In this work a novel route has been also investigated using amines for the ring-opening. Because of the basic properties, adding of amine compounds, such as ammonia, aminoethanol, ethylenediamine and piperazine has successfully converted the lactone into compounds containing two functional group viz. alcohol and amide, in essentially quantitative yields. Product design through varying the structure of the amine compound, such as backbone structure and presence of functional groups, appears to be a promising polymer engineering pathway. As such, the novel pathway delivered co-monomers for use in polymer synthesis, to manufacture possible green polymers.",

     "abstract": "Hydrolysis of polysaccharides is one of the important steps for biorefinery. This paper demonstrates effects of microwave heating on hydrothermal hydrolysis of carbohydrate by comparing microwave and induction ovens. Identical thermal history could be obtained by high heating rate of both methods. To have higher sensitivity for detection of microwave effects, maltose was used as the simplest substrate. Hydrothermal hydrolysis was conducted at heating temperatures at 180\u00a0\u00b0C to 220\u00a0\u00b0C for 0 - 30\u00a0min of heating time with 4\u00a0min of come-up time. These heating profiles were precisely traced by using PID-aided temperature control. Hydrothermal hydrolysis of maltose started above 180\u00a0\u00b0C. Higher saccharification rate was achieved at higher temperature, however, degradation of glucose became predominant at 220\u00a0\u00b0C. Highest saccharification rates were almost the same by both heating methods, however, glucose yield was relatively higher at severer condition in microwave heating showing higher stability of glucose under electromagnetic field. To improve the microwave-assisted hydrothermal hydrolysis, several kinds of microwave absorbing agents including salt, metal oxide and graphite were tested. From the screening, halide salts (LiCl, LiBr, NaCl, NaBr, KCl, KBr) improved the reaction and the highest saccharification rate attained around 70% at lower temperature (200\u00a0\u00b0C) with salt concentration of 1% w/w. There was no significant difference among kinds of halide salts with different alkali metals. Sulfate, metal oxides and graphite did not show good effect. By monitoring the microwave outputs, the additions of halide salts were also found effective for reducing the total energy consumption. Increase in heating temperature required higher energy consumption when the water was used for medium, however, addition of sodium chloride at 1% w/w decreased the total energy consumption down to 60 - 70%. The results suggested that assistance of salts may be effective to improve hydrothermal hydrolysis of biomass under electromagnetic field.

Starch accumulates in the pith of the sago trunk. Composition of dried sago pith is mainly starch and fiber components. Direct conversion of sago pith into fermentable sugar will reserve the water and save the energy for starch extraction and drying. This research investigated the effects of sago pith pretreatment as heating in water and in dilute sulfuric acid using microwave heating and autoclaving. Liquefaction of starch was conducted using \u03b1-amylase on 95\u00a0\u00b0C, and enzyme consortium between dextrozyme (amyloglucosidase and pullunase), cellulase dan xylanase on 50\u00a0\u00b0C for saccharification process.

Conversion process which included the pretreatment was carried out by microwave heating in water or in dilute acid, starch, and fiber hydrolysis into fermentable sugar. The results shows that direct heating of sago pith in water by microwave treatment can swell and gelatinize the starch, make the fiber more amorphous and more susceptible for enzyme reaction. Heating in dilute acid directly converted the starch and fiber into depolymerized products and gave more simple sugars (DP of 1.11-2.56) compared to autoclaved heating of sago pith (DP of 2.00-2.11). Microwaved-treatment produced lower DP of sugars during liquefaction (DP of 3.8-13.3) compared to autoclaved heating (DP of 7.3), but expressed some higher DP of sugar during saccharification (DP 3.1-3.8) compared to autoclaved heating (DP of 3.0).",

     "abstract": "Natural rubber latex (NRL) is often used to prepare the blended films by solution-casting technique. Its film presents interesting physical properties in elasticity and adhesiveness. From the good physical properties of NRL, it can beused to prepare transdermal patches which gain popularity due to several advantages such as convenient application, avoid first-pass metabolism, possibly to attain sustained and constant drug levels. However, the skin serves an excellent barrier against drug permeation due to the rigid lamellar structure of the stratum corneum lipids. Enhancers can improve the partition of drug into the stratum corneum by increasing the thermodynamic activity of the drug in transdermal formulations. The aims of this study were (i) to prepare the blended films from deproteinized NRL (DNRL), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), various enhancers, i.e., fatty acid (oleic acid), ester of fatty acid (isopropyl palmitate; IPP), fatty alcohol (propylene glycol; PG), hydrocarbon (olive oil), and terpene (menthol), and (ii) to study the physical and mechanical properties of the obtained films. The results showed that DNRL could be compatible with all enhancers. Hence, the blended films were characterized for strength (ultimate tensile strength; UTS), elasticity (elongation at break), and adhesiveness (peel strength and tack adhesive). It was found that these characteristics depended on type and concentration of incorporated enhancers.",

     "abstract": "Central to the view of electron-transfer reactions is the idea that nuclear motion generates a transition state geometry at which the electron/hole amplitude propagates coherently from the electron donor to the electron acceptor. In the weakly coupled or nonadiabatic regime, the electron amplitude tunnels through an electronic barrier between the donor and acceptor. The structure of the barrier is determined by the covalent and noncovalent interactions of the bridge. Because the tunneling barrier depends on the nuclear coordinates of the reactants (and on the surrounding medium), the tunneling barrier is highly anisotropic, and it is useful to identify particular routes, or pathways, along which the transmission amplitude propagates. Moreover, when more than one such pathway exists, and the paths give rise to comparable transmission amplitude magnitudes, one may expect to observe quantum interferences among pathways if the propagation remains coherent. Given that the effective tunneling barrier height and width are affected by the nuclear positions, the modulation of the nuclear coordinates will lead to a modulation of the tunneling barrier and hence of the electron flow. For long distance electron transfer in biological and biomimetic systems, nuclear fluctuations, arising from flexible protein moieties and mobile water bridges, can become quite significant. We discuss experimental and theoretical results that explore the quantum interferences among coupling pathways in electron-transfer kinetics; we emphasize recent data and theories associated with the signatures of chirality and inelastic processes, which are manifested in the tunneling pathway coherence (or absence of coherence).",

Subsequently, we present our recent theoretical studies on exciton dynamical localization and excitonic coherence generation in photosynthetic systems. We apply a variational-polaron approach to investigate decoherence of exciton states induced by dynamical fluctuations due to system-environment interactions. The results indicate that the dynamical localization of photoexcitations in photosynthetic complexes is significant and imperative for a complete understanding of coherence and excitation dynamics in photosynthesis. Moreover, we use a simple model to investigate quantum coherence effects in intercomplex excitation energy transfer in natural photosynthesis, with a focus on the likelihoods of generating excitonic coherences during the process. Our model simulations reveal that excitonic coherence between acceptor exciton states and transient nonlocal quantum correlation between distant pairs of chromophores can be generated through intercomplex energy transfer.

On one hand, theories of optical spectra and excitation energy transfer have to be developed that take into account the pigment-pigment (excitonic) and the pigment-protein (exciton-vibrational) coupling on an equal footing. On the other hand, the parameters entering these theories need to be calculated from the structural data. Good agreement between simulations and experimental data then allows to draw conclusions on structure-function relationships of these complexes and to make predictions. In the development of theory, a delicate question is how to describe the interplay between the quantum dynamics of excitons and the dephasing of coherences by the coupling of excitons to protein vibrations. Quantum mechanic coherences are utilized for efficient light harvesting. In the reaction centers of purple bacteria an energy sink is created by a coherent coupling of exciton states to intermolecular charge transfer states. The dephasing of coherences can be monitored, e.g., by the temperature dependent shift of optical lines. In the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein, which acts as an excitation energy wire between the outer chlorosome antenna and the reaction center complex, an energy funnel for efficient light-harvesting is formed by the pigment-protein coupling. The protein shifts the local transition energies of the pigments, the so-called site energies in a specific way, such that pigments facing the reaction center are redshifted with respect to those on the chlorosome side. In the light-harvesting complex of higher plants an excitation energy funnel is created by the use of two different types of chlorophyll (Chl) pigments, Chla and Chlb and by the pigment-protein coupling that creates an energy sink at Chla 610 located in the stromal layer at the periphery of the complex. The close contact between Chla and Chlb gives rise to ultrafast subpicosecond exciton transfer, whereas dynamic localization effects are inferred to lead to long ps relaxation times between the majority of Chla pigments.",

Secondly, we critically examine some existing approaches to the numerical description of system-environment interaction in the non-perturbative regime and present a promising new method that can overcome some limitations of existing methods.

The biophysical basis of this compass remains unknown. One of the two major hypotheses postulates that birds use a light-induced radical pair reaction involving coherent spin evolution of two electrons as the foundation of their magnetic compass sensor. This hypothesis has received significant attention during the past decade.

These characteristics are in agreement with the Radical Pair model proposed by Ritz et al. (2000). Using the same experimental set-up, we tested the model by behavioral spectroscopy\u2019, exposing migratory birds to radiofrequency fields of different frequencies and intensities. Such fields affected the orientation only when applied at an angle to the field lines. Tests with different frequencies led to an estimate of the life time of the crucial radical pair between 2-10\u00a0\u03bcs. We also could identify an extremely sensitive resonance at the Larmor frequency, which implies specific properties of the radical pair. Cryptochromes, a blue-light absorbing photopigment, has been proposed to be the receptor-molecule; it has been found to be present in the retina of birds.",

     "abstract": "The investigation of C-H bond activation by enzymes over the past several decades has revealed a plethora of deviations from semi-classical kinetic models. Although the early enzymatic results were interpreted in the context of a tunneling correction, the emergent properties are now seen to be largely incompatible with this type of analysis as well. This chapter introduces some of the experimental data that form the basis for our present understanding. A vibronically nonadiabatic model, that has a number of features in common with the Marcus treatment for electron transfer, offers a robust physical picture for the hydrogen tunneling behavior seen in both native enzymes and in enzymes that have been perturbed either by site-specific mutagenesis or by perturbation of the reaction conditions. Native enzymes under optimal conditions most commonly show behavior that requires a heavy atom donor-acceptor distance that is in the range of 2.7\u00a0\u00c5. This compression beyond van der Waals distances is proposed to arise from the process of enzymatic conformational sampling. The absence of any evolutionary driving force to optimize tunneling for deuterium transfer (natural abundance < 0.02%), together with the frequent observation that the enthalpic barrier for deuterium transfer is the same or very similar to that for protium transfer, leads to the proposal that tunneling is a consequence of a generic property of enzyme function in which overall protein flexibility enables the generation of active sites that can be quite compressed.",

     "abstract": "Nuclear quantum mechanical tunnelling is important in enzyme-catalysed H-transfer reactions. This viewpoint has arisen after a number of experimental studies have described enzymatic reactions with kinetic isotope effects that are significantly larger than the semiclassical limit. Other experimental evidence for tunnelling, and the potential role of promoting vibrations that transiently compress the reaction barrier, is more indirect, being derived from the interpretation of e.g. mutational analyses of enzyme systems and temperature perturbation studies of reaction rates/kinetic isotope effects. Computational simulations have, in some cases, determined exalted kinetic isotope effects and tunnelling contributions, and identified putative promoting vibrations. In this review, we present the available evidence \u2013 both experimental and computational \u2013 for environmentally-coupled Htunnelling in several enzyme systems, namely aromatic amine dehydrogenase and members of the Old Yellow Enzyme family. We then consider the relative importance of tunnelling contributions to these reactions. We find that the tunnelling contribution to these reactions confers a rate enhancement of \u223c1000-fold. Without tunnelling, a 1000-fold reduction in activity would seriously impair cellular metabolism. We therefore infer that tunnelling is crucial to host organism viability thereby emphasising the general importance of tunnelling in biology.",

     "abstract": "Long-lived electronic coherences in various photosynthetic complexes at cryogenic and room temperature have generated vigorous efforts both in theory and experiment to understand their origins and explore their potential role to biological function. The ultrafast signals resulting from the experiments that show evidence for these coherences result from many contributions to the molecular polarization. Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a technique whose goal is that of obtaining the time-evolution of all the density matrix elements based on a designed set of experiments with different preparation and measurements. The QPT procedure was conceived in the context of quantum information processing to characterize and understand general quantum evolution of controllable quantum systems, for example while carrying out quantum computational tasks. We introduce our QPT method for ultrafast experiments, and as an illustrative example, apply it to a simulation of a two-chromophore subsystem of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex, which was recently shown to have long-lived quantum coherences. Our Fenna-Matthews-Olson model is constructed using an atomistic approach to extract relevant parameters for the simulation of photosynthetic complexes that consists of a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approach combined with molecular dynamics and the use of state-of-the-art quantum master equations. We provide a set of methods that allow for quantifying the role of quantum coherence, dephasing, relaxation and other elementary processes in energy transfer efficiency in photosynthetic complexes, based on the information obtained from the atomistic simulations, or, using QPT, directly from the experiment. The ultimate goal of the combination of this diverse set of methodologies is to provide a reliable way of quantifying the role of long-lived quantum coherences and obtain atomistic insight of their causes.",

     "abstract": "High-performance liquid chromatographic methods were developed for the separation of the enantiomers of 19 \u03b2-lactams. The direct separations were performed on chiral stationary phases containing either amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate), (Kromasil\u00ae AmyCoat\u2122 column) or cellulose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate), (Kromasil\u00ae CelluCoat\u2122 column) as chiral selector. The different methods were compared in systematic chromatographic examinations. The separations were carried out with good selectivity and resolution. The AmyCoat\u2122 and CelluCoat\u2122 columns appear to be highly complementary. The best separations of bi- and tricyclic \u03b2-lactam stereoisomers were obtained with the AmyCoat\u2122 column, while the 4-aryl-substituted \u03b2-lactams were better separated on the CelluCoat\u2122 column. The elution sequence was determined in all cases; no general rule could be established.",

     "abstract": "The digestion of baker\u2019s yeast wastewater was monitored by gas production intensity and composition of gaseous and liquid phases. Favorable coexistence of sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens was explained by the presence and metabolism of trimethylamine, a degradation product of betaine. Concentration of sulfides decreased at the expense of betaine degradation with final products S0 and N2. Since biological wastewater treatment was complicated by both high content of SO42-, eventually becoming reduced to toxic H2S, and high total nitrogen content, a technological solution that links sulfate reduction to elemental sulfur coupled with reactions producing gaseous nitrogen may have great practical value.",

     "abstract": "Complex polymers were characterized by combinations of different chromatographic separation mechanisms: liquid adsorption chromatography (LAC), liquid chromatography under critical conditions (LCCC), and liquid exclusion-adsorption chromatography (LEAC). These techniques were combined off-line and on-line in two-dimensional separations. Fatty acid ethoxylates, fatty esters of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbates were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography with normal phase LAC as the first and liquid chromatography at critical conditions (LCCC) or liquid exclusion adsorption chromatography (LEAC) as the second dimension. A full separation of all oligomers to the baseline could be achieved in both dimensions. In two-dimensional separations, the offline approach is compared to comprehensive chromatography, and the scope and limitations of both techniques are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Chromatography which is sensitive to the sizes of macromolecules and to their adsorption serves as an appropriate method to separate complex polymers. Unfortunately, the molar mass also influences the chromatographic retention, thus making quite difficult the problem of separation of polydisperse polymers by their topology.By using a theory of chromatographic behavior of macromolecules, we simulate chromatograms of polydisperse polymers that differ solely in their topology, and discuss possibilities to separate complex polymers (such as eight-, tadpole-, theta-, manacle-shaped polymers, etc.) from their linear, branched, or macrocyclic precursors or topo-isomeric products.As follows from the simulations, two approaches towards the separation of polydisperse polymers by topology are especially promising. The first one is the chromatography at optimized (critical or near-critical) interaction conditions, where molar-mass effects are minimized; The second one consists in combing different chromatographic modes, which allows obtaining a separation by both molar mass and topology in a 2D chromatogram.Some of the simulated chromatographic separations are qualitatively very similar to the real ones, the others are the theoretical prediction.",

The extraction of free fatty acids from Brassica napus (rape) and Brassica rapa (turnip) seeds was performed by using both methanol-chloroform mixture and supercritical fluid extraction techniques. The quantitative analysis of the seed composition was carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method. The detection limits were determined using a mixture of ten standard fatty acids and were found to be 3 ng of each acid per spot.",
