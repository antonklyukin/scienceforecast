     "abstract": "A cheap and easy to handle methodology was adapted to achieve the measurement of CO2 diffusivity within solid food matrices. This methodology was tested on real food products with different composition (cooked ham, butter and processed cheese). Local distribution profiles, measured using a customized chemical titration, permitted in the same time to determine CO2 solubility and identify diffusivity values within the different kinds of food studied. Values of solubility were found of 2.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0mol\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0Pa\u22121 for cooked ham, 3.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0mol\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0Pa\u22121 for processed cheese and 3.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0mol\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0Pa\u22121 for butter, at 22\u00a0\u00b0C. Validity of Henry\u2019s law to predict dissolved concentration of CO2, indispensible prerequisite to diffusivity identification, was assessed on a large range of CO2 partial pressure (0\u2013100%) in the three products tested. Values of diffusivity, varying from 0.57\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m2\u00a0s\u22121 for cooked ham to 1.42\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m2\u00a0s\u22121 for butter with an intermediate value of 0.88\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m2\u00a0s\u22121 for processed cheese, tended to be closely connected to the composition of the matrix (fat, protein and water contents).",

The suitability of the mathematical models of the performance parameters was evaluated using various statistical parameters, such as the mean percentage error, the mean bias error, the root mean square error, the modelling efficiency and the chi-square test. The models developed showed excellent generalisation capabilities.The decanter was shown to be able to process olive paste with a high extraction efficiency that, without water added, could reach 92.5%; sufficiently dry solids and olive oil clarified by light solids were produced in both of the configurations studied. The decanter was also demonstrated to be able to switch from one configuration to the other without stopping operation.",

     "abstract": "To discover the potential functionalities of fenugreek gum (FG) in food applications and pharmaceutical industry, steady-shear flow, thixotropy and dynamical viscoelasticity tests were systemically carried out under a range of FG concentration (0.05\u20132.0%, w/v) and temperature (0\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C). The results showed that FG aqueous solutions exhibited Newtonian plateaus followed by shear-thinning regions which were found to be well correlated to the Carreau model. It was also found that the pseudoplastic behaviors of the FG aqueous solutions exhibited a concentration dependence. When the concentration of FG was above 1%, the system exhibited a gel-like behavior. Dynamical viscoelastic properties also showed a solid, elastic-like viscoelastic behavior. While solution with FG concentration of 0.05% exhibited a transition from a fluid-like to gel-like structure. The variation of the thixotropic index \u03b1 as a function of FG concentration showed a stronger thixotropic behavior as the polymer concentration increased, which indicated a typical elastic behavior of FG solutions with high concentration. Multiwave temperature ramp test for 1.0% (w/v) FG aqueous solution showed that the solid-like behavior had a strong dependence on frequency rather than temperature, which was consistent with the results of oscillatory frequency sweep test. These results could provide a useful indicator for the applications of FG in food industry and other fields.",

This films were prepared by casting using glycerol as plasticizer from protein dispersions submitted to high pressure treatments of different intensity (0.1, 200, 400 and 600\u00a0MPa). Protein dispersions treated with high-pressure were able to form uniform films with better mechanical properties, lower water solubility and water vapor permeability than those prepared from non-treated protein dispersions without modifying its thickness, color and water content, but somewhat more opaque. This could be attributed to structural changes by high-pressure treatment, which favored protein unfolding, increasing protein surface hydrophobicity and the amount of free SH, that were re-associated during film formation producing a higher crosslinking of matrixes that was denoted in a better functionality of films. These films also showed better properties than those prepared with amaranth protein isolates thermally treated.",

Laser scattering and light microscopy showed CHP reduced the pulp particles to \u223c10\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm, producing smaller and more uniform particles, with processing at 276\u00a0MPa and 2 passes producing greatest particle reduction. No differences in moisture or color were found due to different treatments. In general, G\u2032\u00a0>\u00a0G\u2033 for all samples, suggesting a soft gel network. Both the storage modulus (G\u2032) and loss modulus (G\u2033) decreased with CHP pressure. G\u2032 decreased modestly with frequency between 0.1 and 2\u00a0Hz, and more dramatically between 2 and 30\u00a0Hz, with behavior characteristic of entangled polymers. In general, yield stress decreased with homogenization pressure, but increased with number of passes. CHP-treated samples had lower consistency and were less shear-thinning than the control. Repeated passes increased the consistency of CHP samples. The results suggest CHP processing produced smaller and more uniform particles, causing a reduced level of microstructure that contributes to elastic properties at small deformation.",

     "abstract": "Coffee extract was freeze-concentrated through block and falling-film techniques. Solute retention and concentration efficiency were determined after one stage of these processes. Ice morphology was characterized through image analysis. Preservation of volatile compounds was determined through GC\u2013MS.

Solute occlusion was higher for falling-film than for block freeze-concentration, with an average distribution coefficient of 0.45 and 0.29, respectively. The ice crystal size was lower for the falling-film technique; this explains the higher solute occlusion. The dewatering capacity was higher for the falling-film technique, as this process is faster than block freeze-concentration. The most abundant volatile compounds of the coffee extracts were preserved after freeze concentration with both techniques. In the same way, no differences were found in most of the sensory attributes of the freeze-concentrated extract obtained using both techniques. Our results confirm the benefits of the block and falling-film freeze concentration techniques in preserving the quality of coffee extracts.",

The difference between results of these models can be neglected. The effect of the storage duration on the rheological behaviour is different for the different liquid egg products.The eggs were also loaded by the non-destructive impact.

     "abstract": "In process engineering practice, including those in food industry, simple mathematical solutions are more useful. Learned assumptions are necessary to support effective simplifications. Previously it has been suggested that for a conduction and convection coupled system, there is an approximately linear temperature or concentration gradient between the surface and the average temperature, which occurs at a \u2018fixed location\u2019 within the conduction domain. The local temperature at the point is also said to be similar as the average temperature. This gradient is thus approximately the same as the temperature gradient at the interface between the conduction domain and the convection medium when thermal properties are considered constants. The distance from the surface to this \u2018fixed location\u2019 is marked as the characteristic transport length (CTL), which is a fraction of the size of the conduction medium. The previous findings were based on the agreements between the numerical solutions and compartmental, and then integral solutions in different occasions The argument has been validated among moderate Biot numbers (Bi) of <10 and moderate Fourier numbers (Fo) of >0.3. Similarly, one should find that the diffusional mass transfer process has the same property due to the same mathematical nature involved. Here, the mass diffusion process has been analyzed to yield the CTLs for the cases of infinite Biot number, where the analytical solutions for longer times for semi-infinite slab, infinite cylinder and sphere are available which can be put to great use. When applying these classical solutions for the above purpose, there are still new discoveries, which are interesting to report here.",

Moisture and state (rubbery/glassy) dependent mechanical and transport properties are used. A complex shrinkage pattern that is not simply equal to the amount of water lost is observed at low moisture contents due to glass transition of the material. For high drying rates, the surface dries out faster than the core and forms a case-hardened layer resulting in early deviations in shrinkage. In contrast, for low drying rates, deviations in shrinkage occur at extremely low moisture contents due to a gradual rubbery/glassy transition.

     "abstract": "Porosity is one of the key parameters of the macroscopic structure of porous media, generally defined as the ratio of the free spaces occupied (by the volume of air) within the material to the total volume of the material. Porosity is determined by measuring skeletal volume and the envelope volume. Solid displacement method is one of the inexpensive and easy methods to determine the envelope volume of a sample with an irregular shape. In this method, glass beads are used as a solid displacement media due to their uniform size, compactness and fluidity properties. The smaller size of the glass beads means that they enter into the open pores that have a larger diameter than the glass beads. Although extensive research has been carried out on porosity determination using displacement method, no study exists which adequately reports the micro-level observation of the sample during measurement. This study set out with the aim of assessing the accuracy of solid displacement method of bulk density measurement of dried foods by micro-level observation. Solid displacement method of porosity determination was conducted using a cylindrical vial (cylindrical plastic container) and 57\u00a0\u03bcm glass beads in order to measure the bulk density of apple slices at different moisture contents. A scanning electron microscope (SEM), a profilometer and Image J software were used to investigate the penetration of glass beads into the surface pores during the determination of the porosity of dried food. A helium pycnometer was used to measure the particle density of the sample. Results show that a significant number of pores were large enough to allow the glass beads to enter into the pores, thereby causing some erroneous results. It was also found that coating the dried sample with the appropriate coating material prior to measurement can resolve this problem.",

     "publication date": "12-2015",
     "abstract": "Over recent years, there has been an explosive growth of interest in the development of alternative approaches for crude palm oil (CPO) refining. During a typical refinery process, free fatty acid (FFA) is one of the key objectionable impurities that need to be reduced if not completely removed from CPO in order to minimize their detrimental effects on the oil quality. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane shows great potential in removing FFA from CPO owing to its hydrophobic properties, high mechanical strength and good thermal stability. However, low concentration of FFA in CPO, which is normally ranging from 3% to 5%, has hindered the capability of the membranes to separate the trace amount of FFA from the bulk. Thus, modification of PVDF membrane is essential to enhance the interaction between the membrane surface and FFA molecules, facilitating efficient FFA removal. In order to achieve this purpose in the present study, the outer surface of PVDF hollow fiber membranes was crosslinked with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Glutaraldehyde (GA) was used as a crosslinking agent to avoid the PVA dissolution. Despite the negligible morphological change observed in the resultant membranes upon PVA crosslinking, the contact angle has been significantly reduced in proportional to the concentration of PVA used for the crosslinking, suggesting the decrease in membrane hydrophobicity. Additionally, the average roughness of the crosslinked PVDF membranes increased with the increasing PVA concentration. The results obtained suggested that the PVDF hollow fiber crosslinked with 100\u00a0ppm PVA exhibited the highest FFA rejection of 5.93% after 3\u00a0h of operation. In addition, the membrane also showed good result in reducing the content of phosphorus in the permeate and partial reduction of its color intensity. This study served as the first attempt of CPO deacidification through UF membrane system without the addition of any chemical during the filtration process.",

High speed (rpm), i.e. 20,000 or 23,000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0min or prolonged homogenization time (10,000\u00a0rpm\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0speed agitation\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a023,000\u00a0rpm, for 60\u00a0min) led to high \u03b6-potential values, with laponite particles size <80\u00a0nm. With addition of laponite nanoparticles to cassava starch dispersion, an evident transition in NFS from liquid-like viscous to solid-like elastic behavior was observed.

     "abstract": "Osmotic dehydration is a process wherein foods are partially dehydrated by immersion in an aqueous hypertonic solution. Osmotic dehydration reduces the water activity of the food, thereby minimizing the potential growth of microorganisms and extending the shelf life of food products. A major disadvantage of the osmotic dehydration process is the long time required to reduce the water activity, which makes its industrial implementation impractical.The aim of this research is to determine the diffusion mechanisms in Granny Smith apples exposed to different electric fields varying from 0 to 17\u00a0V/cm.Osmotic dehydration was performed at 40\u00a0\u00b0C for both the conventional treatment and for the MEF treatment. The fruit/solution ratio used was 1:11 w/w to prevent and minimize the change in concentration of the solution during the experiment. The osmotic solution was exposed to electric fields of 0, 9, 13 or 17\u00a0V/cm, respectively. To determine the diffusion mechanisms two phenomenological models were tested: Fick\u2019s second law and Anomalous diffusion model.Sucrose diffusion in Granny Smith apples is highly influenced by the application of a MEF, meaning that as the application of the electric field increases, the higher the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) becomes. The exponential decay from the Fick law, in the tail of the diffusion profile, does not represent the shape of the data. However, as the application of the electric field increases the fit of Fick\u2019s model improves, and specifically for an electric field of 17\u00a0V/cm it is observed that the behavior of the experimental data resembles the behavior predicted by Fick\u2019s second law. The empirical parameter \u03b1 for the anomalous diffusion model was always greater than one, but as the MEF increased, \u03b1 was monotonically tending to one.",

Therefore, the control of process conditions and nozzle design are the only ways available to produce foams with diverse properties. Milk foams were produced employing different steam pressures (100\u2013280\u00a0kPa gauge) and nozzle designs (ejector, plunging-jet and confined-jet nozzles). The foamability of milk, and the stability, bubble size and texture of the foams were investigated. Variations in steam pressure and nozzle design changed the hydrodynamic conditions during foam production, resulting in foams having a range of properties. Steam pressure influenced foam characteristics, although the net effect depended on the nozzle design used. These results suggest that, in addition to the physicochemical determinants of milk, the foam properties can also be controlled by changing the steam pressure and nozzle design.",

Thickened milk is a fluid that is commonly served for patients, but is one of the most complex fluids. This study examined the rheological characterisation of individual thickened milk components (protein, lactose and minerals) thickened with a commercial xanthan gum based thickener and investigated the effect of these components on the rheological behaviour of complete thickened milk. It was found that protein increased the final viscosity of the fluid but did not affect the dynamics of the thickening process. Conversely, mineral content significantly slowed down the thickening process, but only slightly increased the viscosity of the fluid. Lactose had no effect on either the dynamics of the thickening or on the final viscosity. This study confirms and explores the interactions between thickener and milk components in milk used for the medical and nutritional management of swallowing difficulties.",

The measurement of dielectric properties appears to be a promising method for on-line monitoring of the drying process in the meat industry.

The dielectric spectra were measured with an Agilent 85070E open-ended coaxial probe connected to an Agilent E8362B Vector Network Analyser in the frequency range of 500\u00a0MHz to 20\u00a0GHz. With this technique it was possible to conclude that there is a direct relationship between the dielectric loss factor at 20\u00a0GHz, considering the number of water molecules on the surface of sample. It was possible to determine the point of water activity at which the surface temperature reaches the air drying temperature, by using the loss angle at 20\u00a0GHz. At this point of water activity, the liquid phase disappears and internal transport controls the drying process.

     "abstract": "Generally the virgin olive oil (VOO) requires a cleaning operation that is performed using a vertical disc stack centrifuge representing the most important source of product oxidation. Natural settling represents an alternative to the oil/water separation but it results unsuitable for modern processes due to great amount of time required to perform the operation. In the present paper are reported the results of VOO cleaning through an enhanced sedimentation plant by hydrocyclone. Treatments have been compared by physical and chemical characterisation of VOO both after 48\u00a0h from extraction and after 180\u00a0days of shelf-life.The VOO cleaning by the enhanced sedimentation plant showed the capability to increase both processing capacity and VOO quality with respect to both VOO by vertical disc stack centrifuge and by natural sedimentation plant.VOO analyzed after 48\u00a0h and after 6\u00a0months showed a lower oxidation level for oil by enhanced sedimentation, better quality and suitability for prolonged shelf-life than oil by disc stack centrifuge. Moreover, even if disc stack centrifuge plant produces olive oil that is much more clean than oil by enhanced sedimentation plant the latter shows an improved long-term stability.Principal component analysis shows that storage time effect on VOO is quantifiable as a decrease in colour level and an increase in oxidation level.The enhanced sedimentation plant produces an olive oil with the highest amount of antioxidants and pigments, whereas the natural sedimentation plant produces an olive oil with lesser antioxidants and pigments and higher value for K270.",

     "abstract": "To prolong shell life, pistachio kernels are first dried and then in many cases they are rehydrated prior to or during food formulations. Texture of the rehydrated kernels is one of key organoleptic properties for consumer acceptability. In this research pistachio kernels were dried and then rehydrated to different moisture levels to compare the effect of these treatments on their textural properties. This was performed to examine texture differences between pistachio kernels of same water content but different drying, rehydration or thermal histories. Texture profile analysis data showed that hardness, gradient and compression energy of all pistachio samples increased with moisture reduction and significant differences were observed between the textural parameters of dried and rehydrated samples with same moisture level and lower values were obtained for rehydrated samples. It was evident from the results that thermal history of pistachio plays a key role in determining its textural and mechanical properties. Having pistachio kernels of same moisture and different drying and rehydration histories does not guarantee similar textural properties. These findings are clearly showing that texture deteriorations or changes can occur when fruits are first dried and then rehydrated to the initial moisture level. This can have practical implications in developing and designing foods with texture being their main sensory property.",

Pre-treatment of rhubarb fragments by freezing and thawing caused a significant increase (up to 30%) in the efficiency of the pressing process. Juices obtained with this method showed higher extract content and slightly higher acidity, but had similar dynamic viscosity. All the juices obtained showed the features of Newtonian fluid. Interestingly, the juices obtained with various technologies had significantly different chemical composition. Higher level of oxalates was recorded when preliminary freezing and thawing treatment was used. Both double pressing and the pre-treatment of freezing and thawing resulted in an increase of sample transparency and juice color intensity. The originality of this development involves the use of freezing and thawing of the pulp as a new form of pre-treatment in juice pressing from raw materials of plant origin.

Using trials performed on a lab-scale tumbling simulator, massaging was controlled and characterized by three mechanical indexes.

It was demonstrated that tissue damage is not the main factor explaining salt migration enhancement: a-vs-b comparison showed a 20% increase in Dsalt, which was explained by observed microstructural changes. a-vs-c comparison showed a 200% increase in Dsalt, possibly due to water movement promoted by meat deformation.

Analysis of variance of results revealed that all parameters significantly affected (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) U and hfp. Larger size particles depicted lower U and hfp due to decrease in surface area per unit volume ratio. While Teflon particles had lowest heating rate index, Nylon particles depicted highest U and hfp. This trend was explained by the fact that rate of temperature increase was better correlated with thermal diffusivity while U & hfp were better correlated with thermal effusivity. The magnitude of U and hfp associated with the three shapes varied in the following order: cube\u00a0>\u00a0sphere\u00a0>\u00a0cylinder.

For both juices, the increase in furan concentration during storage was best described by an empirical, logistic model. The duration of the lag phase decreased as a linear function of the storage temperature, while the maximum reaction rate constant followed the Arrhenius law. Furthermore, the rate of furan formation was clearly matrix-dependent, which could be attributed to the differences in juice composition (sugars, ascorbic acid and carotenoids).

Differential Scanning Calorimetry measurements (DSC) were performed to determine glass transition temperatures (Tg) of specimens in a moisture content range of 2\u201325%. All materials are glassy at room temperature according to their Tg values regardless of their moisture content. Most specimens exhibit fragile behavior according to tensile tests, except for neat CS and CS-WPC-3%, with 25% moisture content, which display a fragile-ductile transition in the glassy state. Only small differences are observed among materials with different WPC contents, in terms of glass transition temperatures and mechanical properties. Nevertheless, our results indicate that WPC acts as a plasticizer for neat CS in terms of both, glass transition temperatures and mechanical behavior. Such plasticization effect is probably caused by Maillard reactions. Water, on the other hand, causes an anti-plasticization effect at low moisture contents, as revealed by increases in stress at break up to a maximum value. At higher moisture contents, water induces a plasticization effect and the stress at break decreases. Since no significant changes in strain at break are observed with moisture content, toughness values behave in a similar way to the stress at break exhibiting a maximum value at intermediate moisture contents.",

The results showed that the amount of xenon hydrate in barley coleoptile cells increased with storage time, and that their cellular structure could be destroyed when increasing the amounts of xenon hydrate. Therefore, conditions under a xenon pressure of 1.0\u00a0MPa at 1\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h were used to control the amounts of implemented xenon hydrate. The process of CXF, including the introduction of xenon gas under a pressure of 1.0\u00a0MPa at 1\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h frozen to \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C, was studied. Typical restricted diffusion phenomenon were determined using a nuclear magnetic resonance method, and it was found that CXF barley coleoptile cells were similar to those of fresh barley. In contrast, the FAP barley coleoptile cells showed unrestricted diffusion phenomenon. The results from X-ray radiographic images also suggested that the CXF process can preserve the shape of barley coleoptile tissues and, additionally, it was found that xenon hydrate formation occurred inside the cells and intercellular spacing of such cells. It can therefore be suggested that the assumed process of xenon hydrate formation in plant cells results in CXF being more effective for the preservation of plant cells and their tissues than the FAP process.",

Significant reduction in the PPO activity was seen in all the fruits after a 10\u00a0min ambient ultrasound treatment.

The main objective of this work was to model the inactivation of psychrotrophic B. cereus spores in reconstituted milk treated by high pressure (HPP) combined with a thermal process, and to compare it with thermal inactivation kinetics. First, the effect of HPP pressure (200, 400 and 600\u00a0MPa) for up to 40\u00a0min at 70\u00a0\u00b0C on B. cereus spores was investigated. A pressure increment from 200 to 600\u00a0MPa slightly reduced the spore numbers in the reconstituted milk. Then the influence of temperature at 600\u00a0MPa on spore inactivation for up to 40\u00a0min was studied. Increasing the HPP temperature from 38 to 70\u00a0\u00b0C increased the spore inactivation in milk by 3.5\u00a0log. The 600\u00a0MPa combined with heat enhanced the spore inactivation in milk, requiring a temperature 20\u00a0\u00b0C lower to achieve the same spore inactivation. However, for a 5\u00a0log spore inactivation, the pressure\u2013thermal process required a higher specific energy than the thermal processing. The resistance of two psychrotrophic strains of B. cereus spores in milk was also investigated and showed similar results. The Weibull model described spore inactivation by pressure\u2013heat, whereas the first order kinetics was more appropriate for the thermal inactivation alone. The results of this study confirmed the advantage of HPP technology to further increase the thermal inactivation of B. cereus spores in milk.",

It has been found that increasing the templating-acids concentrations significantly increased the degrees of crystallinity for lactose in spray-dried powders.

     "abstract": "Natural pigments are alternatives to synthetic colorants with growing industrial interest for food and non-food uses (e.g. textiles). However, they are generally thermally labile and therefore their practical interest depends on the loss under typical processing conditions being acceptable. Penicillium strains are producers of natural red pigments of potential interest. The loss of colour of these pigments was studied at relevant conditions for food and beverage pasteurisation. Thermal liability of colour was well described by a first order model (with a constant off-set) at pH 6 up to 80\u00a0\u00b0C, and at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for pH 4\u20138, with a z-value of 48.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0\u00b0C and a D80C,pH6 of 981\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0min. The stability was significantly affected by pH, with an approximately linear increase of 173\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0min in D80 per pH unit. The high z-value, which is 5 times the z of typical target micro-organisms in thermal processing, suggests a good scope for process optimisation to minimise losses. At the middle point of pH 6 these kinetic parameters would suggest that losses of red colour intensity (OD at 500\u00a0nm) of less than 1% in pasteurisation are feasible. Losses will be higher in matrices of lower pH, where process optimisation will therefore be more relevant. It was concluded that these red pigments are of industrial interest, as with further optimisation of industrial production yields to minimise costs, and then going through the process of acceptance as new food ingredients, they are potentially economically competitive.",

     "abstract": "One of the main factors affecting the quality of perishable products is represented by temperature variations during storage and distribution stages. This can be attained through the incorporation of phase change materials (PCMs) into the packaging structures. PCMs are able to absorb or release a great amount of energy during their melting/crystallization process and, thus, they could provide thermal protection to the packaged food. Thus, the objective of this research was to develop polystyrene (PS)-based multilayer heat storage structures with energy storage and hence temperature buffering capacity for their application in refrigerated foods. To this end, polycaprolactone (PCL) was used as the encapsulating matrix of a phase change material (PCM) called RT5 (a commercial blend of paraffins with a transition temperature at 5\u00a0\u00b0C), by using high throughput electrohydrodynamic processing. The PCL/PCM fibrous mats were directly electrospun onto PS films and an additional PCL electrospun layer (without PCM) was also deposited in some experiments to improve the overall functionality of the PCM. The attained morphology, thickness, deposition time, temperature and multilayer structure played an important role on the energy storage capacity of the developed PS-based multilayer structures. Results obtained from a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) show that RT5 can be properly encapsulated inside the PCL matrix and the encapsulation efficiency and, thus, the heat storage capacity was affected not only by the multilayer structure, but also by the storage time and temperature. The thermal energy storage/release capacity was of about 88\u2013119\u00a0J/g. As a result, this work demonstrates the potential of these materials for an efficient temperature buffering effect of relevance in food packaging applications, in order to preserve the quality of refrigerated packaged food products.",

The significant properties of milk (heat capacity, boiling point elevation, thermal conductivity, density, viscosity, surface tension) are modelled with empirical models found in the literature and implemented in the simulator. In order to validate the approach, an industrial milk evaporation process and a pilot-scale evaporator are modelled and simulated. The results are compared with industrial and experimental results respectively, and show a good agreement with the industrial process. However improvements are needed in modelling the pilot scale evaporator. The proposed approach is generic enough to be extended to other liquid foods.",

Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes were tested in a flat sheet module. Fouling experiments were carried out at a transmembrane pressure of 2\u00a0bar and cross flow velocity of 2\u00a0m/s during 2\u00a0h. Cleaning experiments were performed at 1\u00a0bar and 2.2\u00a0m/s. To compare the efficiency of different cleaning solutions (NaOH and P3-Ultrasil 115), quantification of residual proteins on the membrane was carried out by FTIR\u2013ATR. To have a better understanding of the cleaning process, characteristics of the feed solution and of the membranes were considered and contact angle of the membranes before and after the cleaning was measured. Membrane resistances were also calculated at the different stages. Results from resistances showed that reversible fouling prevail over irreversible fouling for both membranes. P3-Ultrasil 115 was a better cleaning agent than NaOH solution since cleaning efficiencies (CE) of 100% for both membranes were achieved for P3-Ultrasil 115 solution. Residual proteins on the membrane after the cleaning were measured both by FTIR\u2013ATR and Pierce-BCA method. Results showed that 100% of permeability recovery did not imply the complete BSA removal from the membrane. However, these measurements corroborated that P3-Ultrasil 115 had removed a higher amount of proteins than NaOH solution.",

The values of \u03c3 f of the ring specimen were best fit with a linear function to moisture content (r2\u00a0>\u00a00.94).

The feasibility of reflectance spectroscopy in the visible and near infrared (NIR) regions was evaluated for the automatic detection of the early symptoms of decay caused by Penicillium digitatum fungus in citrus fruit. Reflectance spectra of sound and decaying surface parts of mandarins cv. \u2018Clemenvilla\u2019 were acquired in two different spectral regions, from 650\u00a0nm to 1050\u00a0nm (visible\u2013NIR) and from 1000\u00a0nm to 1700\u00a0nm (NIR), pointing to significant differences in spectra between sound and decaying skin for both spectral ranges. Three different manifold learning methods (principal component analysis, factor analysis and Sammon mapping) were investigated to transform the high-dimensional spectral data into meaningful representations of reduced dimensionality containing the essential information. The low-dimensional data representations were used as input feature vectors to discriminate between sound and decaying skin using a supervised classifier based on linear discriminant analysis. The best classification results were achieved by employing factor analysis on the NIR spectra, yielding a maximum overall classification accuracy of 97.8%, with a percentage of well-classified sound and decaying samples of 100% and 94.4%, respectively. These results lay the foundation for the future implementation of reflectance spectroscopy technology on a commercial fruit sorter for the purpose of detecting decay in citrus fruit.",

Water vapor permeability (WVP) decreased with lipids and citric acid, due to their hydrophobic nature and crosslinking action, respectively. Hydrophobic additives lowered the WVP of the crust and provided water barrier properties and brittle texture. Crust mechanical properties were greatly correlated with water present as well as with composition of crust layer. Barrier properties of the crust layer were greatly dependent on the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the additives, which determined the internal interactions between starch and proteins and the microstructure and mechanical properties.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of thermal treatment of whey protein isolate (WPI) dispersions over the microstructure and textural properties of AG fabricated with these dispersions. WPI dispersions (9% w/w) with NaCl (0.4% w/w) at three pH\u2019s (6.50, 6.75 and 7.00) were prepared. Dispersions were subjected to thermal treatment at three temperatures (70, 75 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C) at different times depending on the pH. After thermal treatment, dispersions were aerated by mechanical agitation at 2000\u00a0rpm for 3\u00a0min. Finally, aerated dispersions were cooled at 10\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h to set the AG structure. AG were characterized in terms of their gas hold-up capacity, microstructure (bubble sizes) and textural properties. Thermal treatment temperature influenced the gas hold-up and mean diameter (DM) of air bubbles in the AG, both decreasing with an increase in temperature. Maximum gas hold-up was about 70% and DM were in the range of 530\u2013700\u00a0\u03bcm. The increase in apparent viscosity of thermally treated dispersions produced lower air incorporation in AG structure and smaller bubble sizes. Compression stress at break decreased with an increase in the thermal treatment temperature. Control of thermal treatment conditions for WPI dispersions allows to fabricate AG with different microstructural and textural properties which can be used as innovative food matrices for obesity control or delivery of bioactives.",

Under the action of buoyancy, bubbles progressively reach the free surface, and the cloud of bubbles finally vanishes. Bubbles also nucleate on the glass wall, where they grow by diffusion until buoyancy forces them to detach and rise to the free surface to release their CO2. The three batches of sparkling waters were clearly differentiated with regard to their bubbles dynamics and losses of dissolved CO2.

The transmission of heat through the potato can be traced by measuring the distance from the surface to the gelatinization front, which is easy to identify visually. Knowing this distance, the gelatinization temperature, the period of immersion, and the average radius of the potato, the heat transfer coefficient can be calculated. Either a numerical model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) or an analytical solution of the Fourier equation can be applied for the calculation. The gelatinization temperature of the potatoes used was determined to be 67\u00a0\u00b0C by a direct temperature measurement and by visual inspection of the progression of the gelatinization front. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the method is rather precise at relevant values of hfp in vessel cooking (100\u2013300 [W/m2\u00a0K]), allowing a prediction of the centre temperature within \u00b10.6\u00a0\u00b0C.",

The powder\u2019s squeeze flow behavior as a function of water content was useful to characterize the transition between glassy and rubbery states as water content increased. Water sorption (W versus aw) at 20\u00a0\u00b0C was represented using the Guggenheim\u2013Anderson\u2013de Boer equation, with a monolayer water content of 3.67% (d.b.).

The compression pressure necessary for squeeze flow behavior decreased 2.5\u20133 times at ambient temperature (ca. 23\u00a0\u00b0C) as a result of an increase in water content from 3.8% (d.b.) to 10\u201315% (d.b.) at which level glass\u2013rubber transitions manifested, and then kept relatively constant when the water content increased even further. Alternatives to prevent caking of H. pluvialis during scCO2 extract include reducing the initial water content of the powder, increasing particle size by high-pressure agglomeration, and/or reducing the extraction temperature so as to prevent the glass\u2013rubber transition that is responsible for sample stickiness.

The maximum total nisin activity (4657\u00a0IU/mL) was achieved when online foam fractionation was carried out using sterile air of 30\u00a0mL/min between 6\u00a0h and 12\u00a0h, which was improved by 36.2% compared with that of the traditional batch fermentation (3420\u00a0IU/mL) without online separation. This improvement is mainly attributed to the relief of product inhibition through online recovery of nisin, which demonstrates a promising process of industrial nisin production.",

Fresh beef samples were obtained from a commercial slaughtering plant, and stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 0\u201312\u00a0days. The visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) hyperspectral images in the backscattering mode were acquired from 3\u20135 beef samples on each day of the experiment, in parallel with microbiological analysis to enumerate the TVC population. Lorentzian function was used to resolve the light scattering information within the hyperspectral image and consequently Lorentzian parameters, which represented different hyperspectral scattering characteristics were extracted. In this study, not only the individual Lorentzian parameters but also the parameter combinations were used to establish the multivariate statistical models for predicting beef TVC, based on the modeling methods of principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and back propagation neural network (BPNN), respectively. The models established using individual Lorentzian parameters did not perform well in predicting low levels of TVC contamination in beef, and the best prediction result could only achieved with the correlation coefficient of prediction set (RP) and root mean squared error of prediction set (RMSEP) of 0.81 and 1.27 log CFU/g, respectively. Based on the parameter combinations, the best modeling results were achieved with RP and RMSEP of 0.86 and 0.93 log CFU/g, 0.87 and 0.79 log CFU/g, 0.90 and 0.88 log CFU/g by PCR, PLSR, and BPNN methods, respectively, which confirmed the superiority of the parameter combination method. The results of this study demonstrated for the first time that hyperspectral scattering imaging combined with Lorentzian function and the proposed parameter combination method could be used to detect low levels of bacterial contamination in beef nondestructively.",

By using an optimal machine learning approach, all three kinds of spectra yielded promising results for quality measurements. The obtained results were better than that in most previous studies. The equatorial surface spectra performed slightly but consistently better than the distal end spectra. The juice spectra performed best in predicting most internal quality parameters.

The present study considers a more realistic case when the last-effect vessel is subjected to fouling. The model of multiple-effect evaporator yields a system of nonlinear equations. Specified parameters are pressures and juice concentrations at inlet and outlet of the evaporator. The solution obtained from an iterative procedure is used to compute two objective functions, which are maximized at different optimum surface area distributions. Given a known rate of fouling, it is shown quantitatively how much the area of the last-effect vessel must be increased relative to the areas of the other vessels in order to achieve the maximum overall steam economy or the maximum amount of input to the evaporator.",

This model consists of classical heat and mass transfer equations, which are solved by assuming a quasi-steady-state energy balance at the sublimation interface. The radiative heat coefficient and mass transfer coefficient between the chamber and the condenser are included in the model, and were experimentally obtained by carrying out the ice sublimation tests with the freeze-dryer employed. The mass transfer property is a specification of a given freeze-dryer. This work suggested that it strongly influenced the drying kinetics and it would be an important parameter to meet scaling-up issue. When the sublimation progresses multi-dimensionally, the surface areas of the product exterior, the product bottom and the sublimation interface varied as a function of the extent of drying. These relationships were obtained from experiments with freeze-drying of peeled apple cubes and employed for estimating the mean thickness of the dried and frozen layers with a hollow spherical model proposed in the study. The model equations were solved using commercial spreadsheet software, and the weight loss during drying was predicted as a function of time. The calculation results were in good agreement with the experimental data. This approach allows to set a heating program and/or localized variances of microstructural parameters by manual input, and easily simulate drying kinetics and temperature history.

These contractions are categorised as a longitudinal contraction in the oral direction, a single and two adjacent segmental contractions of the wall, and the combined activity of a pendular displacement and a single segmental contraction. The fluid rheology in the lumen of the organ was Newtonian with viscosity \u03bc = 0.001 Pa s and \u03bc = 1 Pa s . The mixing properties of the flow were characterised by tracking the level of stretching experienced by differential material elements throughout the intestinal domain. The ability of the flow motions to advect (transport) a neutrally buoyant species, initially located at the wall, was also investigated. It was found that the longitudinal contraction, and in particular, its combination with a segmental contraction produced the greatest levels of mixing and transport in the case of low viscous fluids. In agreement with expectations, longitudinal contractions promote mixing and species transport in the vicinity of the wall, whereas its combined activity with a segmental contraction enhance these flow properties throughout the intestinal domain. For a fluid of high viscosity, the segmental contractions were found to enhance mixing above the level of longitudinal and even combined contractions, although it is noted that the advection of the tracer was greatest locally in the location of the segmental contractions.",

The gas sensor array was tested in two separate experiments with two treatments (control and sour skin). The multivariate data analysis revealed that the \u201crelative response\u201d feature combined with relative baseline correction method provided the best discrimination of infected onions among healthy ones. The best performance (85%) was achieved by using the support vector machine model when the data collected from an independent experiment were used for validation.

The Rayleigh waves at frequencies ranging from 800 to 2400\u00a0Hz propagate on the flesh and are detected by a piezo-bimorph sensor in contact with the flesh. We determined the shear elasticity from the velocity for two types of Japanese watermelons, Matsuribayashi777 and Wasenissho, to be 1.18 and 0.74\u00a0MPa, respectively. These correlated well with a sensory firmness evaluation. The values of Young modulus obtained by the surface-wave measurements were nine times larger than those by the compression tests performed, which can be explained by the differences in measurement displacement and frequency. We also investigated the effect of storage on the surface-wave velocity for Matsuribayashi777. The velocity decreased by about 10% after ten days of storage. The present results suggest that this technique can be applied to estimating the elastic properties of various fruits.",

To get a wide range of texture and different freshness in pears, the experiment was conducted every other day during 7\u00a0days storage. Each pear was excited by a half-sine impulse signal, and an LDV was used to measure the response signal from the top of the pear. A fast Fourier transform algorithm was used to transform time domain signals to frequency domain signals. A total of 15 and 8 features were extracted from the time and frequency domain signals, respectively. Pear texture was measured by the puncture test. Maximum force (MF), flesh firmness (FF) and stiffness (Stif) were extracted from the force\u2013deformation curve as texture indices. Different modeling methods, including the stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and principal component analysis-back propagation neural network (PCA-BPNN) methods, were used for quantitative analysis of pear texture. Best prediction results were obtained by the PCA-BPNN method, especially for predicting FF with correlation coefficient (rp) of 0.840 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.959\u00a0N. The Fisher\u2019s discriminant analysis (FDA), BPNN, and PCA-BPNN methods were applied to qualitative analysis of pear freshness. Pears were categorized into 4 groups with different freshness according to the 4 test days. The best results were also obtained by the PCA-BPNN method, resulting in accuracy of 89.0% and 83.3% for calibration and validation, respectively. Experimental results showed that the impulse response method using an LDV is capable for evaluating pear texture and freshness. The proposed approach provides a way for rapid detection of pear quality to meet the requirement of on-line detection.",

     "abstract": "Density of foods is an important physical property, which depends on structural properties of food. For porous foods such as baked foods, accurate measurement of density is challenging since traditional density measurement techniques are tedious, operator-dependent and incapable of precise volume measurement of foods. To overcome such limitations, a methodology was developed using both digital radiography (DR) and computed tomography (CT) X-ray imaging to directly determine density of foods. Apparent density was determined directly from X-ray linear attenuation coefficients by scanning at 40, 60, 80\u00a0kVp on DR and 45, 55, 70\u00a0kVp on CT. The apparent density can be directly determined using CT however sample thickness is needed to determine density using DR. No significant difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was observed between density obtained from traditional methods, with density determined from X-ray linear attenuation coefficients. Density determined on CT for all foods with mean 0.579\u00a0g/cm3 had a standard deviation, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.0367\u00a0g/cm3. Density determination using X-ray linear attenuation was found to be a more efficient technique giving results comparable with conventional techniques.",

It consists of creep-recovery-creep tests for shear stresses in the range 2\u20136\u00a0Pa, avoiding the effect of shear history. Results obtained at the lower stresses applied showed a response dominated by viscoelasticity. At a given higher stress the variability of results obtained allowed the yield stress to be determined, which is associated to the occurrence of shear banding. Above this practical yield stress the results showed a clear thixotropic response. A flow curve free of shear history effects could be derived from series of creep experiments and showed very shear thinning behaviour. The shear rate dependence of viscosity within the fully developed shear flow region fitted the power law equation with a flow index of 0.2 and the comparison of viscosities calculated at different shear times illustrated the thixotropic behaviour of gellan fluid gels.",

This study presents the results of the comparison of seven packing methods with the aim to potentially improve them.

As an important result, a new efficient, time and energy saving method of packing the fish with the combination of dry non-hydrated gel pads and wet ice instead of the use of frozen gel pads alone is proposed. This method ensures recommended storage temperatures between 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 4\u00a0\u00b0C and stable conditions inside the box at room temperatures (or higher) for a longer period of time under the same time-ambient conditions after delivery to the consumer.

The model was capable of predicting the evolutions of the salt concentration and volume as well as the quality changes, in terms of the total nitrogen concentration, total amino nitrogen concentration, total aroma concentration and total change of color, of fish sauce undergoing ED desalination at both laboratory and pilot scales. The model was validated against the experimental results and noted to satisfactorily predict the evolutions of the salt concentration as well as volume of the diluate (fish sauce) and concentrate solutions at both scales; quality changes were also well predicted. The effect of neglecting the water transport during ED on the various predicted values was also illustrated.

The hydrogel particles were assembled using a biopolymer phase separation approach that involved both segregation (thermodynamic incompatibility) and aggregation (complex coacervation) mechanisms. The addition of NaCl increased hydrogel particle size and altered the shape from spherical to rod-like, which was attributed to the influence of salt on the electrostatic attraction between biopolymers. There was a reduction in the lightness and increase in the shear viscosity of the hydrogel particle suspensions with NaCl addition, which was attributed to changes in particle dimensions and morphology. Solution pH also altered particle size and shape, and therefore the lightness and viscosity of the suspensions. In particular, the lightness of the suspensions was greater at pH 3\u20135, than at higher pH values.

After two hours processing on a custom, benchtop scale heat exchanger, the Ni\u2013PTFE modified 316 stainless steel coupons accumulated 2.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48, 5.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.27, and 6.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u00a0mg/cm2 of fouling material for the thermal processing of raw whole milk, chocolate milk without carrageenan, and chocolate milk with carrageenan, respectively.

Raw whole milk exhibited weaker adhesion strength on both native and modified surface when compared to the chocolate milk. The greatest water jet pressure required to remove the foulant from chocolate milk with carrageenan might be influenced by its carrageenan content, which led to the greatest adhesion strength to the stainless steel surface.

The 50\u00a0kDa stage produces a protein concentrate (>17\u00a0kDa). NF produces a retentate containing sugars, amino acids and smaller peptides and a NF permeate containing salt and acetic acid ready for reuse. 42% of the spent marinade is recovered to substitute fresh water and chemicals.

In this work, seven commercial dairy products with different fat content were selected. The effect of initial composition on drying time during single drop experiments was studied. The morphology of powder particles and the influence of morphology changes on the drying rate were investigated in order to assess the effect of fat content on the effective diffusivity of water in dairy products. Results show that fat content influences drying time and morphology of powder particles. The higher the fat content the longer the drying time and particles appear to be less shrivelled. Changes in morphology and the drying rate seem to be related. Two falling drying periods were observed for most of the products. During the first period the drops shrink spherically, while during the second period shrivelling occurs. The effective diffusivity of water shows that high fat contents lead to a lower diffusivity of water in the products.",

The present study therefore aimed to seek a means to improve the mechanical properties of biopolymer films; chitosan was chosen as the biopolymer of interest. The effects of selected physical methods that can be incorporated into the film-forming solution preparation process were investigated. Heat treatment by heating the film-forming solution at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h to induce thermal cross-linkage of chitosan polymer chains was evaluated. In addition, the effects of some processes that led to the homogenization of the chitosan solution and plasticizer (glycerol) were tested. These included rotor\u2013stator homogenization at 9600\u00a0rpm at atmospheric pressure and two-stage high-pressure homogenization at a gauge pressure of either 10/5, 20/5 or 30/5\u00a0MPa. The prepared film-forming solutions were then dried by hot air drying at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and the obtained films were tested for their properties and characteristics in terms of the tensile strength, percent elongation, X-ray diffraction as well as dynamic mechanical analysis patterns. Chitosan film exhibiting the best mechanical properties was the one prepared from the film solution that did not pass through the heat treatment but passed through the high-pressure homogenization at 10/5\u00a0MPa, with the tensile strength and percent elongation of about 46\u00a0MPa and 36%, respectively.

     "abstract": "In the sausage industry, ripening is considered to be the most important phase of the production process. Numerical models were successfully used to study the mass transport in many food during baking, freezing, ripening and drying process. The aim of this research was to develop two finite element models of water diffusion inside a salami, taking account of the vapour exchange phenomena at the surface. One model was based on the real fat and meat distribution, as acquired by image analysis, while a second one, more simple, considering the salami material as homogeneous and imposing an equivalent value of diffusion coefficient, based on compositional equations (parallel, series, Maxwell and Krisher) or literature data. The vapour exchange phenomenon at the surface was described using a surface mass transfer coefficient (hm) calculated on the basis of the well-known Chilton\u2013Colburn analogy. The two models were compared and validated with experimental mean moisture concentration. The agreement between mean simulated and experimental values was reported in terms of determination coefficients (R2). For all models, the R2 value is higher than 0.95, supporting that the experimental and all calculated data are in good agreement. The less good data were obtained with the simplest model, based on equivalent diffusion coefficient coming from literature (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.955, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a01665\u00a0mol/m3). Very small difference was observed between results related to structural models. The finite element model based on the real fat and meat distribution underestimated experimental results, giving results not far from structural models, but giving the best result at the end of ripening time. The deviation from experimental results probably is due to geometrical reconstruction uncertainties and particularly on binarisation triggering on a grey scale.Considering the real fat distribution, a more complex model, but not more precise results than those calculated considering an equivalent homogeneous material, were observed.",

The optimization method is based on the aggregation of three design objectives in a single objective function, which aims at being maximized. The observation variables are interpreted through a desirability scale. Then, the multiple objectives are aggregated into a single global index with a minimization rule.

Nanofibrous membranes have been widely used as affinity membranes to selectively capture molecules onto the membrane surface. However, their capacity to remove microbial cells in food beverages was not yet reported. Here, dead-end filtration experiments working under constant flow-rate were tested with beer samples fortified with yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacteria (Flavobacterium johnsoniae and Iodobacter fluviatilis) ranging from 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 to 5.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0CFU/mL. The filtration experiments resulted in resistance to flow proportional to the cells dimensions. Yeasts formed soft cakes with the lowest resistance. Conversely, it could be assumed that bacteria formed a close-pack arrangements resulting in cakes with higher density, smaller interstitial space and, thus, higher resistance to flow. Microcalorimetric experiments and plate counts demonstrated that NFM were able to completely remove S. cerevisiae from water slurries. Instead, NFM reduced the concentration of F. johnsoniae and I. fluviatilis of only 5 and 3-log cycles, respectively. However, when the two bacteria strains were mixed together, the filtration resulted in the complete removal of the cells. These results were confirmed during the filtration of beer samples inoculated with S. cerevisiae, I. fluviatilis and F. johnsoniae.",

Results showed that the time required to reach equilibrium moisture content was mainly dependent on temperature, water activity level and processing method.

The differences in sorption were also proven by the selected isotherm models. The modified Halsey equation described the sorption behaviour of the pretreated and dried papayas, whereas the untreated, fresh samples were better predicted by the modified Oswin equation.

After normalisation, these signatures were described with 2D Fourier descriptors. Statistical analysis of these descriptors for all scanned fruits allowed automatic generation of new geometric fruit models, representative of the measured dataset. The accuracy of the generator was validated by means of the distributions of volumes and surface area to volume ratios of fruit scans and the newly generated shapes. This 3D shape description and generation method allows to process the entire 3D contour of the observed objects and can be applied to all star-shaped objects (shapes that do not curve back on themselves with respect to the centre of mass). This way, more accurate geometrical models can be produced compared to similar model generators based on shape description using 2D cross-sections. This generator enables fast generation of geometrical models to be used in numerical simulations of heat or mass transport phenomena within horticultural products or their exchange processes with the surrounding environment.",

Multivariate analysis of the obtained signals allowed establishing mathematical models able to predict the European Brewery Convention (EBC) color index and the alcoholic strength with an accuracy of 76% and 86% respectively. Moreover, a discriminant model was established, able to classify beer by styles with 100% degree of accuracy.",

Nowadays the use of optical sensors in cheese making justify developing prediction algorithms for coagulation and syneresis parameters in milk gels with inulin with the goal of improve cheese yield, quality and homogeneity. A randomized factorial design was used to test the effect of inulin concentration (0%, 3%, and 6% w/w), temperature (27, 32, and 37\u00a0\u00b0C), and fat (<0.2%, and 1.5% w/w) on light backscatter parameters typically used for predicting significant coagulation and syneresis indexes. The coagulation process was monitored using near infrared spectrometry, small amplitude oscillatory rheometry and visual coagulation indexes. The extent and kinetics of syneresis was evaluated by volumetric methods. Prediction models with one, two and three-parameter were determined for the whey drainage kinetic rate constant (k), curd yield (cy), clotting time (tclot), visual cutting time (tcut), as well as the rheologically-determined gelation (tG\u20321) and cutting times (tG\u203230). The results demonstrated that it is possible to obtain models for the prediction of coagulation and syneresis parameters in milk gels when inulin is added as a fat substitute using a fiber optic light backscatter sensor.",

Drops of ECF were generated from a syringe pump system-controlled, for images a high speed camera was used and the maximum spread diameter was determined with ImageJ program. The models reported in the literature do not predict experimental data of maximum spread factor, because the EFC behave as non-Newtonian fluid, so it was necessary to modify these models by introducing an apparent viscosity at average shear rate (effective viscosity).

Different types of screw elements, element lengths and positions were designed and configured, while the other parameters were kept unchanged. The screw fill degree and specific mechanical energy output were detected. The results demonstrate that when the helix angle of conveying elements turns from forward (45\u00b0) to reverse (\u221237.5\u00b0), the disc width of the kneading elements decreases from 7.5\u00a0mm to 5\u00a0mm, and when the disc stagger angle turns from forward (45\u00b0) and forward (90\u00b0) to reverse (\u221245\u00b0), the screw fill degree and specific mechanical energy increase. When the length of the reverse kneading element increases, the screw fill degree and specific mechanical energy increase. When the distance between the reversing knead element and the die increases or the element space between the reversing knead element increases, the specific mechanical energy appears to decrease. Thus, the elements with reverse helix or stagger angles, narrow kneading disc, long length and flow-restricting ability increase the screw fill degree and induce high special mechanical energy. The special mechanical energy increases when the reverse kneading element is located at the screw position where the material viscosity is relatively high during extrusion.",

     "publication date": "07-2015",
     "abstract": "Olive oil is a turbid colloidal dispersion. The most common technique used to clear the oil is filtration. Among filter systems, plate filter-presses are used by small companies because the filters are cheap, and the technique does not impair the sensory and chemical traits of the olive oil. However, plate filter-presses have some disadvantages: their operating capacity is low, they require a lot of man power, and filter sheets trap part of the processed oil. It has been argued in the literature that they can retain minor compounds. Furthermore, there is a cost associated with their disposal. The impact of all of these issues could be reduced by the optimization of filtration cycles. Hence, a new processing arrangement was proposed and tested. This consisted of the insertion of a steel pre-filter into the system, which retained part of the suspension. Consequently, the plate filter-press only retained residual solids and water. The plate filter press with the added pre-filter was able to process about 1.8 times the amount of oil normally processed in a batch. Operative capacity was improved and the amount of oil trapped in the sheets was reduced. Furthermore, the number of the filter sheets required was almost halved, which also halves their purchase and disposal costs. A surface fouling mechanism is seen in the traditional filter press configuration, while in the new configuration particle retention is due to depth fouling. This change in the fouling mechanism demonstrates that the addition of a pre-filtration step leads to the more effective use of filter sheets.",

Flow properties of the aqueous phases were dominated by XG rheology, where a zero shear viscosity was detected before the classic shear-thinning behavior (Carreau model). In general, an increase of either XG or WPC in the mixtures resulted in an increase in zero shear viscosity, characteristic time and foaming capacity. The foam stability, evaluated by the kinetics of drainage and Ostwald ripening, also increased with WPC or XG concentration, reaching very stable milk foams. The functionality of WPC was improved by the presence of XG, likely as a consequence of biopolymer segregative interactions (thermodynamic incompatibility).

Interfacial double-layer emulsions were obtained by performing electrostatic deposition of sodium alginate (SA) onto whey protein isolate (WPI) coated oil droplets at pH 5 (10\u00a0wt% oil, 1\u00a0wt% WPI 0.25\u00a0wt% SA). MDX was also added to emulsions formulation in different concentrations (0\u201320\u00a0wt%), and the systems were then stored at two freezing temperatures (\u221218 and \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C). Stability of emulsions was studied using droplet size, \u03b6-potential, as well as microstructure determinations and monitoring backscattering profiles versus time. Non-frozen emulsions showed smaller droplet sizes at higher MDX concentrations thus reducing creaming mechanisms and improving emulsion stability. In the absence of MDX, emulsions were highly unstable after freeze\u2013thawing and destabilized faster at \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C than at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C, which was attributed to the formation of larger ice crystals at slower freezing rates that promoted interfacial membrane disruption leading to extensive droplet coalescence and oiling off. Both systems showed macroscopic phase separation within the first hour of analysis. The addition of MDX greatly improved emulsion stability after freezing, as emulsions showed no phase separation after thawing during one week storage. This behavior was attributed to MDX cryoprotectant effect, that could have considerably reduce the amount of ice formed during freezing, thereby maintaining the integrity of the interfacial WPI\u2013SA bilayer surrounding oil droplets. Our results suggest that 20\u00a0wt% MDX emulsions were the most stable systems both to creaming destabilization and to freeze\u2013thawing processes.",

The highest thawing rate was 1.78 times greater than that obtained for the control samples. However, color, texture, and protein solubility of fish samples declined as a result of thawing under HVEF. Increasing the applied voltage decreased protein solubility and affected the hardness, gumminess, cohesiveness, and chewiness of the fish samples as compared to the control.

     "abstract": "Electrostatic separation has been recently proposed as a novel method to fractionate wheat bran into valuable ingredient fractions. However, systematic study into the influence of parameters on electrostatic separation was lacking. Therefore, this study aimed at a more detailed evaluation of electrostatic separation for enriching arabinoxylans (AX) from wheat bran. The influence of wheat bran particle size, carrier gas velocity and charging tube length were investigated with a lab-scale electrostatic separator. A combination of larger particle size (D[4,3] of 210\u00a0\u03bcm compared to 110\u00a0\u03bcm), higher gas velocity (>28\u00a0m/s) and shorter charging tube (125\u00a0mm compared to 225\u00a0mm) can sufficiently charge the particles, and at the mean time avoid agglomeration by oppositely charged particles. With the optimal settings, single step electrostatic separation of wheat bran could increase the AX content from 23% dm to 30% dm, which is similar as can be obtained by sieving. However, in comparison to sieving, the yield of the enriched fraction from electrostatic separation is lower due to the horizontal design of the setup. Improvement of the yield is expected when adjusting the system design from horizontal to vertical. A sieving step added after the electrostatic separation could effectively remove starch and protein and resulted in a fraction with an AX content of 43% dm, which is around the theoretical maximum value that can be reached by dry fractionation.",

Results showed that the decrease in impedance of albumen and yolk resulted in the increase in the secondary terminal voltage during the eggs\u2019 storage.

The highest linear coefficient of determination (0.9955) between moisture content of yolk and terminal voltage at 50\u00a0Hz was observed. Exponential correlations emerged between the eggs\u2019 conductivity and terminal voltage, with highest coefficient of determination (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.8311 for albumen, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9772 for yolk) at 200\u00a0Hz and 400\u00a0Hz, respectively. The correlations obtained in frequencies ranging from 50 to 400\u00a0Hz at 10\u00a0V laid the foundation for a method of evaluating moisture content and conductivity in albumen and yolks.

The protein content of air-classified fractions is generally lower than obtained with wet methods, therefore we applied pre- and post-treatments to increase the protein purity. A starch-rich legume, pea, and an oil-rich legume, lupine, were pre-treated by varying the moisture content, defatting, soaking or freezing cycles. Higher moisture contents and defatting of lupine increased the protein purity, but lower moisture contents increased the protein yield. Soaking and freezing cycles lowered the particle density, which impaired the separation. Electrostatic separation is based on electrostatic charging behaviour and was successfully applied to enrich air-classified fractions by separating protein and fibre into oppositely charged fractions. The results showed that pre- and post-treatments yielded protein fractions that are significantly purer than those obtained in single-step milling and air classification.",

In the oil extraction process, solvent recovery is one point of major concern, due to its high energy consumption and oil quality losses. Those drawbacks can be partially overcome by integration of membrane technology to the usual solvent distillation step. The present work tested four ultrafiltration (UF) and one nanofiltration (NF) membrane (Microdyn-Nadir) on the solvent recovery of synthetic mixtures of macauba oil and n-hexane. Membranes were pre-treated before use with different solvents in specific time lengths, according to preliminary studies. The membrane performance was evaluated by permeate flux and oil retention. Macauba (pulp and kernel) oil was evaluated by determinations of acidity, peroxide value and fatty acid profile. Membranes showed usual flux behaviour, compatible with other studies concerning oil/solvent mixtures permeation, although its values were quite above the expected. Best results for retention (>30%) are related to the membranes with lower molar mass cut-off (MMCO), and the best balance between permeate flux and oil retention was found for the NF membrane (12.4\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121, 34.7%).",

The microparticles were characterized based on their mean size, size distribution, moisture content, calcium content, adsorbed protein content, encapsulation efficiency and morphology. The films were characterized with respect to their thickness, moisture content, calcium content, adsorbed protein content, mechanical properties, water vapor permeability and morphology. High encapsulation efficiency (87.6% at pH 3.5 and 90.8% at pH 3.75) was obtained for the microparticles produced by ionic gelation. The calcium content after ionic gelation was significantly higher in the films (on average, 3.0\u00a0\u03bcmol/mg\u00a0db) than in the microparticles (on average, 1.62\u00a0\u03bcmol/mg\u00a0db). For the microparticles, an increase in the protein content in solution yielded an increase in the protein content adsorbed, independent of the type of protein used. When 4% protein in solution was used, protein adsorption onto the microparticles (59.2% for whey protein and 45.5% for egg white protein) was significantly higher than that onto the films (25.3% for whey protein and 24.1% for egg white protein) likely due to the smaller amount of calcium present on the microparticles and the larger surface area of the particles relative to that of the films. Although the process of producing films by ionic gelation and later coating them with proteins was straightforward, homogeneous drying of the films was difficult.",

     "abstract": "In the mechanical olive oil extraction process, heating is a common practice to promote the extraction of extra virgin olive oil, especially in a malaxer machine. Nevertheless, the process of heat transfer in the malaxer machine has not been fully explored. Temperature is a dominant factor in various physiochemical changes and in enzymatic reactions that occur during the malaxation process and a bad management of this parameter may affect the quality of the oil irreversibly. To establish a model of the temperature distribution of the whole malaxer machine, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) may be the most effective method. In this study, a mathematical model that analyses the fluid flow and heat transfer of an olive paste malaxing process was developed and solved using a finite element-based software (COMSOL Multiphysics). The objective is to study the olive paste behaviour in order to improve the design of a malaxer machine increasing the effect of the fluid flow on the heat transfer performance. The results of this paper show that particular design parameters influence the flow and temperature fields inside the malaxer machine. The validity of our mathematical model is corroborated by our experimental work on the olive paste heating in an experimental industrial malaxer prototype equipped with specifically designed kneading tools in an industrial continuous olive oil plant. Good agreement exists between the simulated and experimental results. The 3D CFD simulation model has been developed for two different geometry configurations of the machine. The temperature field and the trajectories of single particles determine an intermediate cold area that is wider in traditional malaxer machines (with a single set of blades) compared to the examined malaxer prototype (with a double set of blades). Additionally, a warm area close to the horizontal axis is shown to be smaller and characterised by higher temperatures. The presence of two sets of blades reduces the unevenness of the temperature field during olive paste kneading.",

In addition, model samples with preset water and salt contents were formulated and the US velocity was measured. In the model samples, the salt content (XS) had a more marked effect on the US velocity (13.0\u00a0m/s per \u0394XS\u00a0=\u00a01% wet basis) than the water content (5.0\u00a0m/s per \u0394XW\u00a0=\u00a01% wet basis). The salt gain and the water loss during brining caused the US velocity to increase (61.5 and 49.3\u00a0m/s for 168\u00a0h in LD and BF, respectively). Significant linear relationships between the US velocity and both factors (XS and XW) were established (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.771).

The model comprises of the mass balance, population balance, nucleation kinetics, growth kinetics and lactose solubility and mutarotation rate expressions. The steady state operation of the crystallizer was analysed from the classical mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) model perspective. It was found that the crystallizer behaviour deviated from ideal MSMPR behaviour with a steep upward curvature in the population density curve for crystal sizes below 40\u00a0\u03bcm. A size dependent growth (SDG) rate model was used to model the deviation from ideal behaviour. The parameters of the SDG model were estimated by fitting it to the measured population density curve from the crystallizer. The crystallization kinetic parameters like growth and nucleation rate constants were then estimated by fitting the simulated trends to the measured date. The model showed that the average crystal size follows a transient decaying dynamics before settling down to a constant value. This was reflected in the actual data collected from the crystallizer. The transient dynamics disappeared from the model results when a simple size independent growth model was used.",

First, a MSI system with 3 characteristic wavebands (i.e. 1280\u00a0nm, 1440\u00a0nm and 1660\u00a0nm) was developed for data acquisition. Then, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used for characteristic extraction from multispectral image data. Next, we proposed a novel algorithm for modeling-back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm, namely BP-AdaBoost, and we compared it with two commonly used algorithms. Experimental results showed that the BP-AdaBoost algorithm is superior to others with the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP)\u00a0=\u00a06.9439\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g and the correlation coefficient (R)\u00a0=\u00a00.8325 in the prediction set.

This work reports new progress in the automatic detection of early symptoms of decay in citrus fruit after infection with the pathogen Penicillium digitatum using laser-light backscattering imaging. Backscattering images of sound and decaying parts of the surface of oranges cv. \u2018Valencia late\u2019 were obtained using laser diode modules emitting at five wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared regions. The images of backscattered light captured by a camera had radial symmetry with respect to the incident point of the laser beam, these being reduced to a one-dimensional profile through radial averaging. Two models were used to characterise backscattering profiles: a statistical model using the Gaussian\u2013Lorentzian cross product (GL) distribution function with five parameters and a physical approach calculating the absorption, \u03bc a , and reduced scattering, \u03bc s \u2032 , coefficients from Farrell\u2019s diffusion theory. Models described radial profiles accurately, with slightly better curve-fitting results (R2\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a00.996) for the GL model compared to Farrell\u2019s model (R2\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a00.982), both indicating significant differences in the parameters between sound and decaying orange skin at the five wavelengths. For dimensionality reduction purposes, feature selection methods were employed to select the most relevant backscattering profile parameters for the detection of early decay lesions. The feature vectors obtained were used to discriminate between sound and decaying skin using a supervised classifier based on linear discriminant analysis. The best classification results were achieved using a reduced set of GL parameters, yielding a maximum overall classification accuracy of 93.4%, with a percentage of well-classified sound and decaying samples of 92.5% and 94.3%, respectively. Results also pointed out application limits of Farrell\u2019s diffusion theory at 532\u00a0nm laser wavelength, for which high absorption of pigments occurred.",

The highlight and interesting point of that work is the introduction of sugar as a binder which dramatically improved both the tensile strength and dispersal behavior of produced tablets. In this work, the investigation on the effect of sugar alcohols (i.e., isomalt and xylitol) was carried out in order to find the mechanism on how the binders (sugar alcohols) change the properties of the tablets. The effects of sugar, isomalt and xylitol on the key properties of the tablets (i.e., the tensile strength, the dispersal/dissolution behavior), the morphology of pores and tablets, especial the thermodynamic properties of aqueous suspensions were investigated. It was found that sugar alcohols depress the freezing points of aqueous suspensions, reduce the ice growth rate and induce to form a new pore morphology, a sphere-like porous solid body. Isomalt as binder improves the properties of the produced tablets to a higher degree than sugar and xylitol. A fast dispersal cocoa tablet (16\u00a0mm \u2205, 10\u00a0mm height) with a fast dispersal time of lower than 1\u00a0min and a better crushing force of 45\u00a0N (i.e. 0.18\u00a0N/mm2 diametral tensile strength) was obtained.",

Evaluation of each treatment efficiency was performed through the analysis of the disintegration index of the seeds, oil yield, deformation curves and oil quality among others. The disintegration index increased with the energy input and it was higher for seeds treated by HVED. PEF treatment increased the oil yield by 4.9% and HVED, if accounted oil losses in water, resulted in the extraction of 22.4% more oil when samples are compared to control. The grinded sample presented higher oil yield than PEF and lower than HVED. The deformation curves were very similar for all samples, except for the grinded seed, which reached higher deformation values during pressing. Results of the HPLC analysis show that the oil lignan profile was the same for all analyzed treatments. Moreover, there were low protein and polyphenols losses during treatment and, therefore, a cake rich in these compounds is obtained as a by-product of the proposed process.",

     "abstract": "Caramel is a dairy-based confection with a continuous phase consisting of amorphous sugars and dissolved dairy solids with proteins and fat globules dispersed throughout. In some caramels, sugar crystals are desirable for their contribution to texture. The crystals disrupt the continuous phase, providing what is known as a \u201cshort\u201d texture. At the extreme, fudge is known as a well-crystallized caramel. However, little is known about how crystal content influences the textural and physical properties of caramel.By changing sucrose to corn syrup ratio, type of corn syrup and water content in caramel formulations, the effects of sucrose crystal content on textural properties such as hardness, tensile strength, strain at break, and cold flow were studied. However, since crystallization is a separation process, changes in crystal content also resulted in variations in the viscosity of the continuous phase, which also influenced caramel textural properties. Thus, the results were interpreted as a combination of two, sometimes competing, effects. Increased crystal content decreased cold flow, with cold flow approaching zero as crystal content increased above 25\u201330%. Tensile strength and strain at break also decreased as crystal content increased, again reaching a minimum value at crystal content of about 25%. Hardness, on the other hand, was significantly influenced by the viscosity of the continuous phase and less so by crystal content. Knowing the effects of sucrose crystallization on textural properties allows caramel manufacturers to more precisely select the ideal formulation for their final product.",

     "abstract": "In the last years the utilization of novel mild technologies to induce structural modifications of food allergens and, consequently, to inhibit the allergic reaction was extensively investigated. Among these technologies High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) was proved to be very promising being able to induce significant modification of protein secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure, causing reversible or irreversible denaturation, aggregation and gelation.In this work the rheological characterization of a selected allergenic protein after HHP processing was carried out and the effect of the processing parameters was described through the modelling of the rheological behavior of processed samples. The Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), a globular protein, solubilized in sodium phosphate buffers (50\u00a0mM) was selected and the effect of different protein concentrations (12, 25, 50 and 100\u00a0mg/mL), pressure levels (600, 700 and 800\u00a0MPa) and treatment times (15, 25\u00a0min) was studied during the experimental trials.The experimental results demonstrate that the protein solution processed at pressure levels above 600\u00a0MPa show the characteristic behavior of a pseudoplastic fluid and that the processing variables, namely pressure level and treatment time, as well as protein concentration, play an important role on the rheological properties of the system. The values of the viscosity and the shape of the curves of the viscosity as a function of the shear stress change with increasing the pressure level, prolonging the treatment time and/or increasing the protein concentration. Indeed, HHP treatments at pressure levels below 600\u00a0MPa are able to induce changes of the protein structure at the microscopic scale, as demonstrated by the reduction of the denaturation temperature. HHP processes may be successfully applied to modify and/or control the rheological behavior of the allergenic proteins.",

Fouling was monitored by observing the variation in overall heat transfer coefficient (OHTC) with time and consisted of an induction phase (non-fouling) and a decline phase (fouling). A significantly shorter run-time was obtained with pre-heating at 65\u00a0\u00b0C than with pre-heating at 75, 85 and 95\u00a0\u00b0C. A longer holding time (25\u00a0s) in the pre-heating section significantly increased the run-time of the plant compared with 5\u00a0s holding. The high-heat temperature also affected the OHTC and run-time; similar run-times were observed at 135, 140, 142 and 145\u00a0\u00b0C but at 150\u00a0\u00b0C there was no induction phase and fouling rapidly occurred.

Sorption isotherms of whole seeds, hulls and embryos were established and highlight the uniform behaviour of seed fractions towards water. Seed expression is highly influenced by seed moisture content and water activity in unidirectional and screw presses. Transposability of discontinuous pressing to continuous screw presses has been assessed. Seed mechanical properties are affected by water activity and moisture content. Moreover, fracturability evolution according to moisture content gives indication about oil yield dependency from water content and minimal elasticity corresponds to maximal oil yield for flaxseed. The relations established between sorption isotherms, drying behaviour, mechanical properties and pressing (unidirectional and continuous) leads to global view of water impact on seed processing.",

The results revealed that the gelling property of pomelo pectin could be advantageously promoted through divalent ion addition (Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+) or acidification. With addition of divalent ions, the gel modulus increased with increasing size of the ions, i.e. Ba2+\u00a0>\u00a0Ca2+\u00a0>\u00a0Mg2+. In addition, the acid-induced gelation of the studied pomelo pectin had superior gel strength and higher elastic modulus compared to commercial citrus pectin with similar degrees of esterification and molecular weight. It is considered that the distribution pattern of methyl ester groups of pomelo pectin, which are different from commercial citrus pectin, was likely responsible for these favourable dual gelation characteristics. Overall, this finding suggests that pomelo pectin is a promising food ingredient and would be potentially useful for a range of food applications that require gelling or thickening through divalent ion addition or acidification.",

Pulsed UV radiation, a non-thermal process, is a promising alternative for inactivating food pathogens and preventing its degradation by microorganisms. This study aimed to investigate pulsed UV light\u2019s efficacy for inactivating Escherichia coli in goat milk and its effect on milk\u2019s organoleptic attributes. The goat milk samples were first inoculated with E. coli and then irradiated with different doses of pulsed UV light generated using an exciplex laser unit. The results showed that a 6-log reduction of the initial microbial population was achieved using 10,000\u00a0mJ\u00a0cm\u22122 of pulsed UV. Samples irradiated with 5000 and 10,000\u00a0mJ\u00a0cm\u22122 doses exhibited aromatic changes compared with the non-irradiated control sample. No significant differences in the physical or compositional parameters of the irradiated and control samples were found.",

The objective of this study was to study the influence of batter formulations on surface irregularities of fried batters. Variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VP-SEM) was used to study the surface microstructure of batters prepared using different combinations of wheat and rice flours. Images of batter surfaces were captured, and characterized using parameters such as the total number, mean area, the biggest area, ratio and roundness of the generated ruptures on the coating surface after frying. The total number of generated ruptures on the surface of fried batters was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) influenced by the batter coating formulation. Batters formulated only with wheat flour showed the highest number whereas batters formulated only with rice flour showed the least number of holes and cracks. Roundness of the ruptures ranged from 0.19 to 0.35. The higher amount of rice flour used in the formulation of batter, the higher the area of generated holes and cracks on surface was observed. Fat content was directly correlated with the ratio of the observed holes and cracks generated on the surface (|r|\u00a0=\u00a00.72), whereas moisture loss was correlated with ratio (|r|\u00a0=\u00a00.67) and mean area (|r|\u00a0=\u00a00.77).",

The CtO emulsions stabilized by S1670 and P1670 were very stable, the CtO emulsions stabilized by L1695 partly destabilized, and the CtO emulsions stabilized by TW20, TW60, and TW80 mostly destabilized into oil layers separated on top. The excellent stability of CtO emulsions stabilized by S1670 and P1670 was also confirmed from similar thermograms obtained from differential scanning calorimeter after three cooling\u2013heating cycles (40\u00a0\u00b0C to \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to 40\u00a0\u00b0C at 5\u00a0\u00b0C/min). It was proposed here that S1670 and P1670 affected the interfacial fat crystallization and their interfacial layers protected CtO emulsions against partial coalescence. Differently for the case of CnO emulsions, the CnO droplets remained liquid during freezing. All CnO emulsions stabilized by any emulsifiers destabilized by coalescence since these small surfactants could not provide enough interfacial barriers.",

The degree of gelatinization of four native starches, wheat, potato, cassava and corn, was determined by the enthalpic transitions and simultaneous events between loss of birefringence and swelling to quantify the process in situ and in real time. In all cases, the following three stages were identified: low granular swelling, with little water absorption and 100% birefringence; gradual leading to complete loss of birefringence with the absorption of a large amount of water (approximately 50%); and complete granular swelling to equilibrium. A clear gap between the beginning and end of the loss of birefringence and swelling was observed. When the birefringence reached zero value, 50% swelling was reached at 55.7, 62.0, 68.7 and 70.6\u00a0\u00b0C for wheat, potato, cassava and corn, respectively.

Lower molecular weight of the OSA starch preparation and lower viscosity of the water phase resulted in a higher efficiency of microencapsulation (EM) and higher oxidative stability (OS) of oil during storage of powders. The addition of trehalose was the factor that had a greater influence on the properties of powders than the factor of the type of OSA starch preparation. Modification of powders composition involving substitution of 2/3 of OSA starch with trehalose resulted in: changes in the structure and shape of particles and a decreased volume of air occluded in their interior; a significant decrease in particles size and deterioration of their flowability; as well as in significant improvement of powders reconstitutability in water; increased hygroscopicity of powders and their susceptibility to caking.",

The supersaturation dependent induction period estimated from the experiment were used to derive the nucleation kinetics based on the classical nucleation theory. Size and morphology of the nucleated crystals were analyzed with different initial concentrations. The lower concentration (S\u00a0=\u00a04.51\u20136.99) yields individual crystals with needle and pyramidal morphologies and the higher concentration (S\u00a0=\u00a06.99\u20138.14) yields aggregated crystals with fan-like morphology. The nucleation kinetics study reveals that, the transition in interfacial energy leads to the nucleation of aggregated crystals and the rate of aggregation increases with increase in concentration. Characterization analysis of the individual and aggregated crystals infers their crystalline phase purity and the form of crystallization. This method enables to produce \u03b1-LM crystals with a shorter induction period and the interfacial energy play an important role in producing good quality crystals suitable for dairy and dry powder inhaler applications at lower concentration levels (i.e., S\u00a0=\u00a04.51\u20136.99).",

     "abstract": "Before pineapples are canned, the ones with high nitrate level must be sorted out first because nitrate causes black stains on the surface of the can; therefore, a nondestructive technique for sorting out pineapples is clearly needed. The use of visible and near infrared (Vis\u2013NIR) spectroscopy for such purpose was investigated in this study. A batch of 75 pineapple fruits that would have been delivered to a canning factory was tested. Spectra were acquired using a spectrophotometer in interactance mode with wavelengths in the region of 400\u20132500\u00a0nm. Twelve scans of different parts of each pineapple were made. The actual amount of nitrate in the pineapple flesh was determined by HPLC. Original spectra and pretreated spectra were both used to construct calibration models with partial least squares regression (PLSR). The best model was obtained from an average spectrum pretreated with first derivative treatment at the wavelength range of 600\u20131200\u00a0nm. Predictions based on this model matched closely with the actual nitrate contents, with a high correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95 and a low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.77\u00a0ppm. These results demonstrate that Vis\u2013NIR spectroscopy can be used for rough screening of intact pineapple.",

     "abstract": "During heating the structure of cheese changes which impacts on the functional properties. This research compares the rheological and structural changes during heating of three types of cheese: Mozzarella, medium Cheddar, and aged Cheddar. We use small amplitude oscillation rheology and a variety of magnetic resonance techniques to study these changes. The complex viscosity of Mozzarella and the two Cheddar samples varied with temperature. A number of structural changes were identified as being responsible for variations in the rate of change in viscosity. Magnetic resonance indicated that as cheese is heated there is a progressive increase in the quantity of free water present in the cheese structure. The diffusion properties of water within the structure allowed information relating to the tortuosity and the surface to volume ratio of pores to be calculated, and subsequent analysis indicated that these properties are temperature dependent. These results indicate that significant information regarding the structural dynamics of various constituents of cheese can be monitored during heating using rheology and magnetic resonance. In particular the MR data include the first application of time dependent diffusion measurements to characterize the molecular dynamics associated with structural changes in cheese.",

     "abstract": "Partly replacing malt with unmalted barley is a trend in brewing. The use of unmalted barley, however, leads to issues such as haze and high mash viscosity, due to its higher content of undesired components. Pearling, an abrasive method to remove the outer layers of the barley kernels has been shown to reduce the content of insoluble fibre, ash, protein and polyphenols; the \u03b2-amylase activity and starch content of the remaining kernel were hardly affected. Removing the outer 5% of the kernel, for example, results in a 15% reduction of insoluble arabinoxylans, 23% of the insoluble fibre content and 25% of the water holding capacity of the non-starch components. It also reduces the ash content by 19% and the polyphenol content by 11%, but only 0.20% of the starch is pearled off. A relation was found between the insoluble fibre content and the water holding capacity of a fraction. Lower fibre content reduces the water holding capacity and thus the volume of the spent grains, which implies that less wort and sugar are lost during filtration. In addition, that the bran fraction remains dry, implies a reduction in energy required to dry the spent grains.",

The objective of the paper was to develop and validate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for predicting the temperature profiles during the thermal processing of this sample. Samples of a commercial fruit salad, composed of five different fruits with different shapes, sizes and thermal properties, submerged in water/sugar syrup, were submitted to thermal treatments in a pilot plant and temperature profiles at different locations were experimentally recorded. Results showed that the slowest heating point (SHP) was positioned at 19\u201320% of the can height: fruit closest to the SHP such as pear presented the lowest F value. Moreover, F values resulted to be influenced by the distance from the jar bottom as function of natural convection motion of the syrup. CFD model simulations data were then successfully validated against the experimental ones: results, expressed as RMSE, showed a good fitting between calculated and experimental data, both for syrup (mean RMSE 1.47\u00a0\u00b0C) and fruit pieces (mean RMSE 1.63\u00a0\u00b0C). In addition, F values calculated from both experimental and simulated temperatures resulted very similar with only little differences. In conclusion, the proposed approach and mathematical model can thus be usefully applied for the simulation and prediction of thermal processes of canned fruit salad for process design and optimization.",

The isothermal adsorption studies were carried out over a range of concentrations (100\u20131000\u00a0mg/L) and temperatures (25\u00a0\u00b0C, 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 55\u00a0\u00b0C). Freeze drying or extrusion of apple pomace enhanced its capacity to adsorb EGCG. Analyses of thermodynamic parameters showed that adsorption of EGCG to freeze dried pomace powder was an exothermic process whereas that to extruded pomace powder was endothermic. This is due to the altered character of the binding sites for EGCG as a result of process-induced changes, which contributed to different underlying mechanisms of binding of EGCG to the processed apple pomace. This suggests that the adsorption mechanism was dependent on the processing treatment used. Our study highlights that by choosing the appropriate processing treatments, the adsorption of EGCG to apple pomace could be improved.",

     "abstract": "The total counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. (EPC) appeared on edible salmon flesh were determined by using near-infrared (NIR) (900\u20131700\u00a0nm) hyperspectral imaging. Three-dimensional hyperspectral images (x,\u00a0y,\u00a0\u03bb) of salmon samples were acquired at different storage time. Spectra (\u03bb) extracted in reflectance (R) unit and two other transformed spectra units, absorbance (A) and Kubelka\u2013Munck (KM), were prepared to relate to the measured EPC data by using partial least square (PLS) regression. Based on the three spectra parameters, three full wavelength PLS models defined as FR-PLS, FA-PLS and FKM-PLS were developed with all correlation coefficients of prediction (RP) over 0.900. To simplify these models, wavelengths holding the most important information were selected by executing competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm. Better performance was found in the resulting simplified R-PLS model (defined as FRS-PLS model) which was established with only nine important wavelengths (931, 1138, 1175, 1242, 1359, 1628, 1641, 1652 and 1655\u00a0nm) selected from R spectra. The absolute difference between root mean square errors of calibration (RMSEC) and prediction (RMSEP) in the FRS-PLS model was 0.063, less than half (44%) of that of the original FR-PLS model. By applying the FRS-PLS model to the 2-D images (x,\u00a0y), EPC distribution maps were generated to visualize the spatial variation of EPC and the adaptability of the FRS-PLS model for EPC evaluation was further demonstrated with these distribution maps in which different colors indicated different degrees of EPC contamination. To sum up, NIR hyperspectral imaging technology shows a great potential to predict the EPC contamination in salmon flesh. In view of the results obtained from this study, a multi-spectral imaging system could be developed and further refined for online detection applications in fish industry.",

     "abstract": "This study was the first attempt to understand if thermal stability of any food product during storage could be determined. In this respect, a novel method, namely, the thermal loop test was used to determine structural changes and thermal stability of creamed honey in this study. The novelty of this method was that thermal stability of a product is tested within a number of thermal cycles over a determined range of temperature. Creamed honey was characterized in terms of physicochemical, thermomechanical and rheological properties. It showed non-Newtonian thixotropic behavior at all temperature levels (10, 25 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C). Time-dependent flow behavior was successfully defined by Weltman and second order structural models. Hysteresis loop area depended on temperature and decreased with increase in temperature. Creamed honey had liquid-like structure, showing that it had more pronounced viscous nature than elastic nature (G\u2033\u00a0>\u00a0G\u2032). Temperature sweep tests were conducted to determine temperature dependency of \u03b750, G\u2032 and G\u2033 values using Arrhenius equation. These test results confirmed the thermal stability test results, revealing that thermal loop test can be an accurate method to determine thermal stability of similar food products, as a new information. Relative structural index value (\u0394) increased with number of thermal loop, suggesting that creamed honey had low thermal stability and showed a great structural change by the thermal stress applied between 5\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. These results suggest that crystallized honey be abstained from large temperature fluctuations to avoid from irreversible changes in rheological characters; thus, to maintain spreadability.",

The frequencies of the four generators powering the MATS system at Washington State University were measured at different power levels over one year. The effect of frequency shifts in the generators on heating patterns within a model food (whey protein gel, WPG) was studied through computer simulation. The simulated heating patterns were experimentally validated using a chemical marker. Our measurement results showed that a 0.5\u00a0kW increase in the microwave power caused the operating frequencies of the generators to increase by 0.25\u20130.75\u00a0MHz. The simulation results suggested that the heating pattern of WPG processed by the MATS system was not affected by the varying frequencies of generators within the operating frequency bandwidth (900\u2013920\u00a0MHz). In addition, the simulation results revealed that using deionized water as the circulation medium in the MATS system resulted in a 23\u201337% increase in the temperature of WPG as compared with that when using normal tap water, but did not alter the heating pattern.",

Permeability is a key parameter affecting extraction as it determines the flow rate through the bed and hence brewing and residence time.

Dry fractionation yields functional protein-enriched flours without using water, consumes the least energy and exergy losses are low. Purer protein fractions are obtained via conventional wet or aqueous fractionation, but these processes require large amounts of water and an energy-intensive drying step. With the use of exergy analysis, we demonstrate that water and energy consumption can be reduced by replacing drying steps with concentration steps and by combining dry and aqueous fractionation processes.

The objective was to investigate the effect of the shear-to-compressive force ratio in puncture tests on watermelon, then design new probes that would improve the test\u2019s sensitivity. A new hollow probe design of increased shear force (compactness\u00a0=\u00a011.6\u00a0mm2/mm2) was more sensitive at quantifying watermelon tissue mechanical properties when compared to the industry standard Magness\u2013Taylor probe (compactness\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm2/mm2). Compressive force applied is constant between the two. The hollow probe was more sensitive to differences between tissue types, though was not able to discriminate between cultivars, using the maximum force value. Based upon the improved performance of the hollow probe with tissue types, a high-shear \u2018snowflake\u2019 probe was designed and compared to the hollow and Magness\u2013Taylor probes. The Magness\u2013Taylor probe misclassified tissue types in 42% of samples tested, while the hollow and snowflake probes performed better, misclassifying 32% and 34% of samples, respectively.

The analytical solution to the model was obtained and compared with both the numerical solution and the analytical solution to an elementary case of KS (constant) and validated against experimental data on moisture as a function of time for soybeans in cultivar CD 202 at different temperatures. This process confirmed that the analytical solution is correct and able to be applied in the simulation, analysis, optimization and projects of hydration units as well as any processes involving kinetics in accordance with the model studied.

A new evaporation\u2013condensation\u2013diffusion formulation that idealizes the distribution of bubbles in dough as periodic cubes is presented here. The effects it elicited on water flux, total water loss and variations in local water content were investigated. Additionally, a continuous approach involving four components (dough, CO2, air and water), mass, energy transport and dough deformation was developed. Experimental validation was performed both on usual variables such as temperature, total height and water loss, and on CO2 release, and profiles of local gas fraction and water content. The mechanisms of expansion and compression in the expanding dough during baking are discussed for the first time, with the help of both a non-invasive technique (MRI) and numerical simulations. Only two parameters related to the mechanical properties of dough (viscosity and rupture leading to the opening of pores) were tuned; both CO2 release (onset), and local gas fractions (position of the squeezed region) were revealed to be highly sensitive to these parameters. A single set of physically-consistent values was found to reproduce satisfactorily the experimental findings related to the transport and expansion of the gaseous phase.",

     "abstract": "We aimed to optimise a new smoking\u2013salting method using water-vapour permeable bags to obtain smoke-flavoured salmon. This involved a smoking\u2013salting process with three salt doses (4, 6, 8\u00a0g\u00a0salt/100\u00a0g fresh salmon) and two packaging types: high barrier (HB) bags and water vapour permeable bags (WP) with different humidity levels (50%, 60% and 70% RH). The salting and vacuum packaging combination increased the salt concentration in the final product versus WP bag packaging. The lower the RH for WP-packed samples in the drying chamber, the lower the moisture and aw values. The 8% salt dose/60% RH samples came closer to the aw, salt content and moisture levels determined in commercial samples. In WP samples, 50% and 60% RH completely evaporated the water released by muscle. Sensory attributes of the new product obtained similar scores to the commercial product. The new methodology is suitable to obtain smoke-flavoured salmon with similar physico-chemical characteristics and consumer acceptance to a commercial smoked salmon reducing processing steps and brine wastes.",

AL are composed mainly by low-weight carbohydrates which are highly hygroscopic, so AL become sticky when stored at ambient relative humidity (RH). Stickiness in food could be considered as a negative or positive aspect. In this work, four factors affecting stickiness of AL were studied (ingredients, RH, surface rugosity and compression time), both to decrease and to increase it. Surface rugosity of AL had the greatest impact on stickiness, being the smoothest side stickier than the roughest side. The RH at which AL were conditioned and the ingredients used in this work also had a great influence on the adhesion force. In this manner, stickiness can be modified (increasing or decreasing) according to the specific requirements for using AL in different applications.",

The effect of mucilage concentration, temperature, pH, ionic strength and presence of sucrose on the rheological properties of the aqueous dispersions with the addition of NaCl or CaCl2 was also evaluated. All the dispersion samples presented a shear-thinning behavior and a weak elastic gel-like structure because the storage modulus (G\u2032) was larger than the loss modulus (G\u2033) in the studied frequency range. The concentration of mucilage was the variable with the most significant effect on k (consistency index), whereas the presence of sucrose had the highest effect on n (flow behavior index) and tan \u03b4. The type of salt and extraction method significantly affected k, not affecting n. Tan \u03b4 was affected mainly by the type of salt, and some interaction was observed between both factors. Method II and NaCl provided a higher consistency to the dispersions of chia mucilage. These results suggest that chia mucilage could be applied in the production of foods that require additives with thickening capacity, taking advantage of the zero calorific value of this hydrocolloid.",

     "abstract": "High product and air temperatures and moistures are often observed in certain positions of a cold room leading to deterioration of food quality and safety. To reduce food losses, it is necessary to understand heat and mass transfers. However, these transfers are complex phenomena because of the presence of the product (airflow obstacle, heat of respiration\u2026) and the coupling between the transfers and airflow. Temperature and velocity measurements were carried out in a ventilated cold room filled with four apple pallets. Because of the room small dimensions (3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5\u00a0m), the cold supply air headed directly to the rear part of the room. Therefore, the rear pallets were submitted to lower air temperatures compared to the front ones. This leads to more rapid product cooling rate and lower product final temperature at the rear. A simplified model was developed. It describes the evolution of product and air temperatures at different zones in the cold room. Good agreement between the predicted and experimental results was found for both product cooling rate and final product temperature.",

NIR spectra were collected from a series of dilutions of bacterial suspensions in phosphate buffered saline. Different spectral pre-processing methods were applied to the raw spectra during model calibration. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to develop calibration models while the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) technique was employed to improve difficult classifications. Besides calibration models based on all wavelengths, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) was implemented for the first time to select some important wavelengths for establishing simplified models in order to classify bacterial strains. Results indicated that, when LS-SVM and CARS were used, the overall correct classification rates (OCCRs) and model simplicity were generally greatly improved over results obtained by PLS-DA. For classification of E. coli and L. innocua at species level, 100% of samples were correctly classified using only three wavelengths (1884, 1886 and 1890\u00a0nm). For E. coli strain identification, use of CARS and LS-SVM produced an OCCR of as high as 85.2% for prediction while PLS-DA using all wavelengths could only attain an OCCR of 48.2% for the same task. Classification of L. innocua strains was also substantially improved using the same strategy and the highest OCCR achieved was 66.7%.

Casein micelles comprised only\u00a0<2% of the particle population by volume in MPC70, MPC80, MPC85 or MPC90 after 90\u00a0min of rehydration at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, as primary particles which had not dispersed fully remained in suspension.

No sediment formation was observed in any of the MPCs after 24\u00a0h of rehydration at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, despite the predominance of primary particles in suspensions of high-protein MPCs. Increasing the temperature of reconstitution from 25 to 50\u00a0\u00b0C during 90\u00a0min of rehydration caused a 41.4% decrease in sediment height for MPC90 in water; however, reductions in sediment height of 89.9% and 99.5% were achieved when MPC90 was rehydrated in milk permeate or 80\u00a0mM KCl, respectively.

The simulation results revealed that a higher temperature zone was created near the probe tip. This temperature alteration was caused by the distortion of electric field at the probe tip area. Increasing the microwave power setting of MATS system amplified the temperature alteration. Proper sensor designs could help to reduce the temperature alterations. The flat probe tip was most sensitive to high power setting. Changing the probe tip to a spherical geometry and decreasing diameter of the probe significantly reduced the temperature alterations.",

However, its poor solubility in water, and thus its low bioavailability, make its use problematic. The formulation of this compound in nanosized suspensions is particularly appealing, since it is known that nanoparticles increase the dissolution rate, thus increasing bioavailability. For these reasons, in this work, SAILA has been applied to the production of \u03b1-tocopherol nanoparticles suspensions. The effect of process parameters such as kind of solvent\u2013antisolvent, concentration of surfactant, concentration of solute, expanded liquid temperature, pressure and composition have been studied. The SAILA process was successful for the production of \u03b1-tocopherol nanoparticles directly stabilized in water suspensions. Changing the operative parameters dimensions have been tuned from micrometric to nanometric scale. In particular, regarding the nanometric scale, stable \u03b1-tocopherol particles suspensions with mean diameters down to 150\u00a0nm have been produced and characterized in terms of morphology, particles size distribution and zeta potentials.

     "abstract": "Mango is a popular tropical fruit, comprising approximately half of all tropical fruits produced worldwide. Phytosanitary irradiation is a promising treatment as an alternative to fumigation. Most of the irradiation, however, is done in pallet loads, resulting in non-uniform dose distribution in fruits. Therefore, accurate dose calculation is needed to ensure proper process control to minimize quality changes. Our objective was to evaluate phytosanitary irradiation treatment for mangoes in pallet loads. Mango\u2019s 3D geometry, ellipsoid shape, based on Computed Tomography data, was used to simulate dose distributions in mangoes using radiation transport code (MCNP5). To calculate average doses at different depths, mango flesh was divided into 20 segments from the surface to the seed. Mango was divided into 0.05-cm vertical sections to calculate doses along the major axis. Radiation energy was 1.25\u00a0MeV from a Cobalt-60 source. For one-directional irradiation, doses from the surface to the mango seed had a build-up region at the outermost region (up to 0.13\u00a0cm) with only 78% of the average dose. An average dose at the outermost segment up to the center of the fruit (0.37\u00a0kGy) was significantly less than 0.56\u00a0kGy at the middle shell and 0.54\u00a0kGy at the innermost shell. Adding 0.1-cm of plastic wrap (PVC) and edible coating to improve dose distribution, the doses at the outermost segment were 0.52 and 0.51\u00a0kGy, respectively. These results are crucial since most insects lay eggs just under the produce\u2019s skin. For multiple product arrangement, as the number of mangoes increased, the average doses decreased. However, at both-directional irradiation, even nine mangoes were acceptably irradiated; the dose uniformity ratio was 2.26. Proper control of phytosanitary irradiation treatment is critical to ensure insect elimination while maintaining product quality.",

However, the ratio of amounts of soluble to total divalent cations in the retentate decreased as concentration factor increased.

In contrast, for whey and for UF permeate, changes in Ca2+ were reversible, when they were subject to similar pH changes.

The present research is addressed to explore the possibility of estimating the percentage of moisture, proteins, added rind, and the ripening time of this kind of cheese by a capacitive technique supported by basic statistical analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN). An instrumental chain composed by a parallel plate capacitor probe, for housing the cheese in a suitable container, and a LCR meter, were used to measure the capacitance of different product mixtures, in the frequency range from 100\u00a0Hz to 10\u00a0kHz. Samples were prepared by mixing cheeses ripened from 8\u00a0months to 36\u00a0months and rind percentage from 0% to 50%. The results show that moisture and protein percentages can be estimated in a quite good manner with a linear correlation (R2 up to 0.81) and ANN (R2 up to 0.83). The ripening time is well linearly assessed in the cheese without the addition of rind (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.994) or if the rind percentage is known (R2 from 0.872 to 0.963). The rind percentage is very well linearly estimated if the ripening time is known (R2 from 0.914 to 0.987). Estimation of the rind percentage if the ripening time is unknown appears more difficult (max R2\u00a0=\u00a00.658) because both ripening and addition of rind involve a decrease in capacitance. The frequency at which the capacitance is measured shows only a weak influence in the goodness of the parameters determination. On the whole and as a trend, the correlations improve increasing the frequency.The obtained results, the conformation of the probe and the minimal data treatments mean that this technique can be considered to be applied in the chains of the grated cheese packaging.",

These physical properties included the dielectric properties, gel strength and water holding capacities. In order to adjust the dielectric constant and loss factor, various amounts of sucrose (0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5\u00a0g/mL (solution)) and salt (0, 100, 200, and 300\u00a0mM) were added to 1% gellan gel (with 6\u00a0mM Ca2+ addition). Results showed that sucrose and salt addition were effective for the adjustment of the dielectric constants and loss factor of gellan gels, respectively. Regression equations were developed to predict the relationship between the dielectric properties of gellan gel with sucrose content, salt content, and temperature (22\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C) at 915\u00a0MHz, and thus can be used to determine the formulation of a gellan gel model food to match the dielectric properties of a certain food that will be processed. The gellan gels with sucrose content of 0, 0.1 and 0.3\u00a0g/mL (solution) showed relatively high gel strength for post microwave process handling. However, the addition of 0.5\u00a0g/mL (solution) sucrose significantly decreased the gel strength, resulting in highly deformable gels. The water holding capacities of all the gels increased with increasing sucrose content, while the effect of salt was not consistent.",

Experimental data for heat, mass transfers and reactions modeling were from previous studies. The options of the frying were oil type, micronutrient-enrichment or not, thickness of final product, frying temperature and number of baths. Frying turned plantain from neutral food to positive or negative categories as a function of process variables. The most impacting parameters were the oil type (SAIN and LIM scores of crisps varied by 6.5 and 7.5-fold respectively) and product thickness assimilated with the final oil content (LIM scores increased by 5-fold from 6% to 33% final fat content). Acrylamide increased LIM scores by 2 to 11-fold in crisps while the use of oils enriched with \u03b2-carotene impacted the SAIN scores by 10\u201320%. The best trade off process time/nutritional score was obtained for thick products (fat content <25%) fried in sunflower oil in non-isothermal conditions. The use of geometrical mean to calculate SAIN scores enabled a more sensitive evaluation of the effect of number of bath.",

The present work aims at investigating defects analysis of cork stoppers from two classes by comparing images recorded by digital photography and neutron imaging. Surface analysis of defects obtained from photography leads to more surface defects in class 4 (6.7%) than in class 0 (4.1%). Neutron radiography and tomography are powerful methods that really show the defects inside the material. From neutron radiography and tomography, class 4 contains 7.5% of volume defects and class 0 5.9%. Moreover, tomography also allows observing defects distribution along the whole stopper and possible interconnectivity.",

The aim of this work was to study the effect of emerging technologies such as high voltage electrical discharges (HVED) and pulsed electric fields (PEF) and ultrasounds (US) on the intensification of the extraction of valuable compounds from Stevia leaves. The proposed processes combined pretreatment (HVED, PEF and US) and extraction of intracellular compounds using water as solvent at ambient temperature. The energy inputs of the treatments varied from 24 to 141\u00a0kJ/kg and the results were compared to control diffusion experiments. Chlorophyll a, and b, total carotenoid, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity (DPPH) were determined. A significant increase in soluble matter and antioxidant compounds was found after HVED, PEF and US-assisted extraction as compared to control samples. Results showed that HVED, PEF and US treatments improved both kinetics and extraction yield of soluble matter. These results show the ability of HVED to be used as a potential technology to enhance protein recovery using water and avoiding the use of other solvents and grinding. Chlorophyll content was significantly higher (3-fold increase) after HVED assisted extraction at 141\u00a0kJ/kg in comparison to control sample (0.352 and 0.355\u00a0mg/L for chlorophyll a and b, respectively). The same energy input for HVED permitted attain highest extraction diffusivities of total soluble matter (D\u00a0=\u00a03.06\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221209\u00a0m2/s), followed by total phenolic compounds (D\u00a0=\u00a02.60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0m2/s) and then proteins (D\u00a0=\u00a06.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211\u00a0m2/s).",

Water content did have an effect on mixing behaviour. When paprika with high water activity (aw) was mixed with salt, the time required to reach good MQ was longer because of the increased cohesiveness and when oregano with high aw was mixed with salt it displayed improved MQ because salt particles were able to stick onto the larger oregano particles and reduced segregation.",

Experimental results confirmed the atomisation mechanism described in the literature, by underlining that the spraying operation is controlled by the coupling of liquid physicochemical properties (viscosity, surface tension, density) and operating conditions (air pressure and liquid flow rate). It was also highlighted that droplet coalescence occurs from a certain distance to the nozzle, counteracting the atomisation mechanism and leading to a reincrease in the droplet size when moving away from the nozzle. Consequently, the modelling of droplet size by DA was improved by adapting the model coefficients of the dimensionless process relationship to the involved mechanisms: either atomisation only close to the nozzle outlet or atomisation followed by droplet coalescence at longer distance to the nozzle.",

Alpha-glycosyl hesperidin (Hsp-G), alpha-glycosyl stevia (Stevia-G) and alpha-glycosyl rutin (Rutin-G) were used as candidate materials. The incubation of quercetin together with transglycosylated materials dramatically increased the dissolved amount of quercetin. The solubilizing effect was ranked as follows: Rutin-G\u00a0>\u00a0Hsp-G\u00a0>\u00a0Stevia-G. The apparent solubility of quercetin from the spray-dried sample with Rutin-G was determined to be 43-fold higher than that of the quercetin crystal. This increased solubility was likely due to the formation of molecular-level quercetin/Rutin-G composites via spray-drying. We reported that different types of aggregated-nanostructures may form from transglycosylated materials in aqueous media. The difference in the affinity among quercetin and aggregated nanostructures may relate to the solubility enhancement, indicating that the structural similarity of quercetin and Rutin-G helped the solubilizing effect.",

Although traceability systems ensure that stakeholders in the supply chain record lot-specific trace-back and trace-forward data, there are few databases available that describe in detail the flow of product in the complex web of supply chains. This paper presents the methodological approach used to design and assemble a relational database of nation-wide trade data for packaged ready-to-eat lettuce and leafy greens. The database was used in the development of an integrated simulation tool (Canadian GIS-based Risk Assessment, Simulation and Planning for food safety tool, i.e. CanGRASP) that can predict the spatial distribution and public health risk associated with contaminated food. The database includes the geographical coordinates of 5 domestic processors, 28 produce distribution centres and 2946 retail outlets from five of the top ten retail chains in Canada. It also includes other critical information to predict the fate of pathogens during distribution of contaminated product through the supply chain including: (a) product volumes handled by each stakeholder, (b) flow of product between stakeholders, (c) temperatures of product each season, and (d) times products spend in each step or during transit between steps, for each season. The database is used by both the simulation and mapping components of the integrated simulation tool during risk assessment exercises associated with emergency preparedness planning and training. Using the database, CanGRASP was able to assess the spread of the population at risk during a simulation of a hypothetical outbreak caused by fresh-cut leafy vegetables contaminated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the Canadian food distribution systems during both summer and winter seasons.",

NMR is used to determine the temperature dependence and parameter estimation is used to estimate the water concentration dependence of the effective diffusivity of water in skim milk (0.90 on total weight basis) during drying by comparing the experimental data obtained using a suspended-drop method, which allows the recording of weight and temperature changes during drying, with the results of a distributed heat and mass transport model.

In the present study, continuous benchtop (3.6\u20137.2\u00a0L/h) PEF processing systems with co-field treatment chambers and bipolar square waveform pulses were used and simulated production conditions were tested for pomegranate juice. Microbial reductions of Escherichia coli, as affected by PEF process conditions (field strength, pulse width, pulse frequency, total treatment time, input energy), production conditions (flow rate, juice holding time and temperature), and juice properties (pH, conductivity, particulate), were investigated. Flow rate, PEF process parameters, production conditions, type of target microorganism, and properties of juice significantly affected microbial reductions by PEF treatments. E. coli ATCC 35218, a non pathogenic surrogate bacterium, exhibited higher resistance to PEF treatments than E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli K12 in pomegranate juice. Increase of a single PEF parameter (field strength, pulse width, pulse frequency, total treatment time, or energy input) is insufficient to achieve maximum microbial reduction. Optimal PEF treatment conditions for maximum microbial reduction depend on multiple factors including PEF processing parameters, production conditions and product properties.

The model-predicted outlet air temperatures at different conditions were found to be overestimated, approximately 3\u20135\u00a0\u00b0C higher, while good agreement was found between measured and predicted expanded bed heights. In addition, the model showed good qualitative agreement in the existence of different thermal zones in the fluidised bed with those observed in experiments. In conclusion, the CFD model could be employed to determine the expanded bed height and to characterise the thermal zones in the fluidised bed, while model development, specifically regarding implementation of droplet/particle interactions in the model is still needed to increase the consistency with the experimental air temperatures.",

     "abstract": "The reduction of oil uptake during deep-frying is a subject with societal relevance, given the trend towards lower-fat foods. Since research into oil absorption during frying is limited, we here report on developing better mechanistic understanding of this process. The oil uptake for different frying temperatures and fry dimensions was measured as a function of the water evaporation rate and water loss. A pore inactivation model was developed based on the hypothesis that the crust is a porous layer through which the exuding moisture vapour flow inhibits oil migration. Decreases in water evaporation rates will cause pores to inactivate, allowing oil to penetrate into the crust. The model provides good predictions to the experimental data. Since the model has two parameters, a purely statistical comparison with a simple linear fit having one parameter, does not show a significant benefit; however, the model better describes the overall trend of oil uptake.",

A contact heating device was specially designed to reproduce the operating conditions encountered during domestic pan frying. Two different solid food models were used for the experiments: (i) a non porous solid gel containing an oil-in-water emulsion without crust formation at its lower surface during heating, and (ii) a cereal batter (water with flour) which exhibited crust formation and the development of an internal porous structure during heating. Under similar heating conditions, these products displayed very different drying and thermal behaviours. The temperature of the gel emulsion never exceeded 100\u00a0\u00b0C and was independent of the heating surface temperature in the experimental range from 160\u00a0\u00b0C to 260\u00a0\u00b0C. This limitation in product temperature rise was explained by the evaporation of liquid water exuding from the product in the interstitial space between the heating surface and the product\u2019s lower surface. By contrast, a crust was formed at the lower surface of the cereal batter, reducing the drying rate of the product at this location and allowing the product to reach temperatures higher than 100\u00a0\u00b0C.",

In this study, we examined the effect of system composition and preparation conditions on the production of edible nanoemulsions using spontaneous emulsification (SE). SE is a low-energy method that simply involves addition of an organic phase (oil\u00a0+\u00a0surfactant) into an aqueous phase. The influence of surfactant-to-oil ratio (SOR), surfactant type, surfactant location, and oil type were tested. The droplet size produced decreased with increasing SOR, and was smallest when the non-ionic surfactant Tween 80 was used. Smaller droplets were formed when the surfactant was initially dispersed in the oil phase rather than the aqueous phase. Ten food-grade oils were tested and we found that droplet size followed the order: medium chain triglycerides\u00a0<\u00a0flavor oils\u00a0<\u00a0long chain triglycerides. No correlation was found between droplet size and the physicochemical characteristics of the oil phase (refractive index, density, interfacial tension, and viscosity).

The rheological response of the fluids was largely independent of bubble size but strongly dependent on \u03d5. The viscous and elastic moduli increased with increasing bubble volume fraction, with elastic dominance prevalent at the higher gum concentration. Extensional rheometry, investigated using filament stretching, revealed that the thinning dynamics of the liquid thread were affected by bubble size, but the filament rupture time was primarily dependent on \u03d5. The rheological behaviour in both shear and extension could be modelled as a single mode Giesekus fluid, with a single set of parameters able to describe both the shear and extensional behaviour in the semi-dilute regime. In the entanglement regime the single mode Giesekus fluid could fit the shear data or the extensional data individually, but not both. The fitted Giesekus fluid model parameters exhibited a strong dependency on \u03d5, offering a way to predict the flow behaviour of these complex food fluids.",

     "abstract": "Automatic detection of defective apples by computer vision system is still not available due to the uneven lightness distribution on the surface of apples and the similarity between the true defects, stems and calyxes. This paper presents a novel automatic defective apple detection method by using computer vision system combining with automatic lightness correction, number of the defect candidate (including true defect, stem and calyx) region counting, and weighted relevance vector machine (RVM) classifier. Automatic lightness correction was used to solve the problem of the uneven lightness distribution, especially in the edge area of the apples. According to the fact that the calyx and stem cannot appear at the same view of image, some apples could be classified as sound (N\u00a0=\u00a00, N is the number of defect candidate region) or defective (N\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a02) apples based on the number of defect candidate region in the preliminary step without any other complex processing. For the rest uncertain apples (N\u00a0=\u00a01), further discrimination was conducted. Average color, statistical, and average textural features were extracted from each candidate region, the relevant features and their weights were also analyzed by using I-RELIEF algorithm. Finally, the defect candidate regions are classified as true defect or stem/calyx by the weighted RVM classifier, and the apples would be finally classified as sound or defective class according to the category of the candidate regions. The result with 95.63% overall detection accuracy for the 160 samples indicated that the proposed algorithm was effective and suitable for the defective apples detection. The limitation of our research is the one single limited inspection view of the apples. Future work will be focused on whole surface and fast on-line inspection.",

Microwave (MW) and radio frequency (RF) applications have potential for their use in industrial thawing. Higher penetration depths of RF contribute to a better distribution of energy generated by the interaction between food and electromagnetic field, and thus help to improve the heating uniformity and to minimize runaway heating. Modeling is one way to design and to optimize such process where complexities due to coupling the heat transfer with phase change and the solution of electric field are faced. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to develop a computational model to determine temperature distribution in frozen lean beef during thawing and experimentally validate the model. For this purpose, a commercial software, based on finite element method, was used to solve coupled heat conduction and electric field in a 3D domain with temperature dependent thermo-physical and dielectric properties. Experimental data used to validate the model referred to a 50\u00a0\u03a9 and a free-running oscillator RF systems with various sized samples.

A novel set of analytical techniques was used and by combining migration results with surface topology results clear differences could be observed between the samples. At 23\u00a0\u00b0C storage the samples with a particle size of 15\u00a0\u03bcm showed higher rate of oil migration and further, the earliest development of fat bloom at the surface. This could be observed both macroscopically and microscopically. Thus, it appears as a larger specific surface area of the non-fat particles facilitates migration of filling oil, possibly due to a more heterogeneous and coarser crystal network with higher permeability. Molecular diffusion cannot explain the level of oil migration observed and, thus, convective flow is assumed to be an important contribution in addition to the molecular diffusion.",

The main steps are: introduction and tamping of ground coffee in a sealed chamber, introduction of pressurized air into the chamber, the introduction of hot water and a pre-infusion phase. It is substantially different to the usual brewing method used in bars: the driving force for the flow is the pressure difference between the interior and the exterior of the chamber (rather than pressurized hot water provided by a motor-driven pump); the extraction process is partially static; the pressure is higher than the traditional method; and the temperature of the extraction chamber can be controlled (in addition to the water temperature control found in the traditional method). The method has been tested with three chamber temperatures and two pressures. At all settings, espressos produced using this method have particularly high and persistent foam. Furthermore, changes in pressure cause changes in some physical parameters and the amount of key odorants in the headspace above the coffee. A benchmark comparison with the capsule method gives differences in several aromatic compounds and in almost all the physical parameters. In conclusion, the beverage produced by the CF method is clearly recognizable by a thick and very persistent foam layer, while the method appears more flexible than the traditional one as the characteristics of the EC can be adjusted as a function of brewing conditions.",

     "abstract": "Plant food materials have a very high demand in the consumer market and therefore, improved food products and efficient processing techniques are concurrently being researched in food engineering. In this context, numerical modelling and simulation techniques have a very high potential to reveal fundamentals of the underlying mechanisms involved. However, numerical modelling of plant food materials during drying becomes quite challenging, mainly due to the complexity of the multiphase microstructure of the material, which undergoes excessive deformations during drying. In this regard, conventional grid-based modelling techniques have limited applicability due to their inflexible grid-based fundamental limitations. As a result, meshfree methods have recently been developed which offer a more adaptable approach to problem domains of this nature, due to their fundamental grid-free advantages. In this work, a recently developed meshfree based two-dimensional plant tissue model is used for a comparative study of microscale morphological changes of several food materials during drying. The model involves Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) to represent fluid and solid phases of the cellular structure. Simulation are conducted on apple, potato, carrot and grape tissues and the results are qualitatively and quantitatively compared and related with experimental findings obtained from the literature. The study revealed that cellular deformations are highly sensitive to cell dimensions, cell wall physical and mechanical properties, middle lamella properties and turgor pressure. In particular, the meshfree model is well capable of simulating critically dried tissues at lower moisture content and turgor pressure, which lead to cell wall wrinkling. The findings further highlighted the potential applicability of the meshfree approach to model large deformations of the plant tissue microstructure during drying, providing a distinct advantage over the state of the art grid-based approaches.",

The average permeation flux increased from (86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08) to (252\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021) L\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121, provided that the rough beer was fed as such or pre-centrifuged to minimize the fouling contribution of yeast cells and aggregates, respectively.

A preliminary stabilization of pre-centrifuged beer using 0.5\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121 of regenerable polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) at 0\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h allowed the permeate chill haze to be reduced to (0.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22) EBC unit; but the average permeation flux fell to (161\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021)\u00a0L\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121.

     "abstract": "Four types of powder were prepared from freeze-dried fruiting bodies of the edible mushroom Hericium erinaceum by 2 different methods-conventional roll milling and the superfine grinding method of jet milling-at 3 different speeds, to compare their physicochemical properties and extraction of proteins and polysaccharides. Jet-milled powders prepared at 16,000\u00a0rpm (JMP1), 9000\u00a0rpm (JMP2), and 5000\u00a0rpm (JMP3), and roll-milled powder (RMP) had an average particle size of 5.5, 12.9, 25.2, and 243.6\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. The reduction of particle size resulted in increased specific surface area, porosity, and bulk density. Among the 4 powders, JMP1 showed the highest bulk density (0.17\u00a0g/ml). The water solubility index of H. erinaceum powder increased from 35.2% in RMP to 53.1% in JMP1. Similarly, the swelling capacity of JMP1, JMP2, JMP3, and RMP was 11.28\u00a0ml/g, 7.36\u00a0ml/g, 6.26\u00a0ml/g, and 5.9\u00a0ml/g, respectively. The extractions of proteins and polysaccharides from H. erinaceum powders were also improved by the application of jet milling. These results suggest that the superfine grinding method of jet milling could provide more opportunities for mushroom powders to be incorporated in a wider variety of functional food applications.",

Pneumatic and mechanical agglomeration technologies were selected to generate different hydro\u2013thermo\u2013mechanical stresses during process. The agglomerates were characterized by their structures (electron microscopy, compactness, X-ray micro-tomography, starch gelatinization) and functional properties (colors, flowability, swelling, water solubility index). The results demonstrate specific effects of shear rate, process duration, and temperature on the physicochemical mechanisms occurring during processing. A functional mechanistic model was proposed to improve the description of the agglomeration mechanisms by considering the reversible and irreversible changes. This offers innovative potential to design new agglomeration processes by considering the physicochemical reactivity of the food powders.",

The swelling of the legume seed is modelled as a moving boundary with an explicit transient equation. The model exhibits a good agreement with the experimental observations and is capable of explaining the stages of hydration. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the degree of hydration is dependent on the bean size and is also sensitive to the selection of the intrinsic permeability of the bean.",

Each process step affects the microstructural characteristics of milk chocolate, involving modifications on its macroscopic properties, such as rheological attributes. Milk chocolate samples were obtained at each phase of the manufacture process: mixing, pre-refining, refining, conching and tempering. Microstructural properties (network structure and particle size) and rheological parameters (yield stress, apparent viscosity, thixotropy, G\u2032 and G\u2033) were evaluated by using respectively an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), and a controlled strain\u2013stress rheometer. Colorimetric analyses (L\u2217, h\u00b0 and C\u2217) were also performed. ESEM analysis revealed important changes in the network structure during process, with a reduction in particle size and an increase in the voids between aggregates, from the mixing to the refining step. Moreover, an increase of all rheological analyzed parameters from mixed sample to the refined one was found. Samples obtained from the conching and tempering steps were characterized by the lowest statistically significantly values of all rheological parameters. This could be related to the changes in the structure aggregation evidenced by ESEM analysis. From colour results, the samples with the finest particles appeared lighter and more saturated than those with coarse particles.",

Fruit leathers are mainly composed of low weight carbohydrates, which have low glass transition temperature (Tg) and are highly hygroscopic, so the product becomes sticky when stored at ambient relative humidity. In this work, apple leather strips (ALS) were prepared. Some formulations contained maltodextrin in order to decrease hygroscopicity. ALS hygroscopicity was evaluated by sorption studies, and crispness by mechanical and acoustic properties. Maltodextrin addition decreased the hygroscopicity of ALS. The addition of 15% maltodextrin reduced the moisture uptake by 45% to samples conditioned at 44%RH. At low moisture contents, the ALS become crispy. The crispness was lost as the moisture content of samples increase, following the modified Fermi equation behavior. The transition from crispy to soft material occurred at a water activity between 0.22 and 0.44. Addition of 15% maltodextrin increased the puncture force, puncture deformation and maximum amplitude up to 143%, 35% and 140% respectively.

The results of the internal friction angle at different particle sizes were not exactly consistent with the results of the flow function, which could be a result of the different particle shapes in addition to the different sizes. Image processing of particles with different particle sizes revealed a difference of HSC (high sensitivity circularity), and particles with more circular shapes showed a lower internal friction angle.

It is considered for use in an increasing number of fresh food applications over a wide range of temperature and pH conditions due to its sanitizing capability. During the disinfectant treatment in a closed chamber or packaging system, ClO2 gas is typically exposed to environmental factors such as light, temperature, and humidity which influence its disinfectant efficiency. Determining ClO2 gas reaction rates and mass transfer properties are extremely important for the design of proper sanitization treatments. The aim of this work was to determine the diffusion coefficient for ClO2 gas in air and reaction rates under dark, UV-A and fluorescent lamp exposure. The effect of temperature on the diffusion of ClO2 was also assessed. A system was designed to measure these properties. The diffusion coefficient was found to be 0.129, 0.145, 0.173\u00a0cm2\u00a0s\u22121 at 5, 23, and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.

Degradation using a 40\u00a0W UV-A lamp was approximately four orders of magnitude larger than with a 34\u00a0W fluorescent lamp. A methodology is proposed for quantifying the amount of ClO2 gas needed in a package and/or treatment chamber.",

Coupled models used updated heat source term based on temperature-dependent dielectric properties for every rotation; while decoupled models used a constant heat source term based on dielectric properties at room temperature. The simulation and validation results showed that the simplification of using the decoupled approach did not affect the predicted temperatures considerably, while reducing the computation time by 93%. When compared to the experiment, the averaged RMSE values of six transient point temperatures of room-temperature and frozen decoupled-models were 5.2 and 6.6\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, which were close to those of the coupled models.

     "abstract": "Fruits and vegetables are porous in nature and undergo pronounced shrinkage during convective drying process. Therefore, shrinkage and porosity should be taken into consideration while predicting heat and mass transfer. This work was conducted to study shrinkage and porosity changes along with simultaneous heat and mass transport during the process. Potato slices were subjected to drying for 7\u00a0h at 62\u00a0\u00b0C. It was observed that shrinkage varies linearly with respect to moisture content and reduction in radial dimension of potato slices was around 35%. Porosity undergoes rapid increase after attaining certain moisture content in final stages of drying. The work was extended to study the influence of shrinkage and porosity on heat and mass transfer. Simulated results were validated with experimental values. This model can be employed to predict temperature, moisture, density profiles and to study shrinkage and porosity of various fruits and vegetables.",

First, essential physicochemical properties of the starting solutions, i.e. density, surface tension and hydrophobicity, were analyzed, and electrophoretic analysis of the solutions was carried out. Density and content of the gaseous phase in the continuous phase were determined. The image analysis allowed assessment of the size distributions of gas bubbles and, subsequently, cross compliance of the population of obtained bubbles was performed using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Next, using the maximum likelihood method, three distributions, i.e. Weibull, log-normal and gamma distributions, were matched to one another. The results showed that the log-normal distribution provided the best description of the bubble distribution.",

Developed protocol was used to analyze the shrinkage-deformation behavior occurring in minor product dimensions, considered the dominant directions in mass transfer. To this purpose, 2D perpendicular slices were obtained from original 3D product and their digital images were processed to evaluate the changes in contour shape, perimeter, and cross-sectional and specific areas of samples. Product contours were averaged to extract relevant deformation characteristics of dried samples. Drying and shrinkage data were further used to estimate variable water diffusivities in product with a previously reported analytical solution for shrinking solids, which was extended to allow for 2D or 3D mass transfer. Studied responses were successfully described as a function of free moisture fraction (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.84). It was demonstrated that shrinkage-deformation behavior was not affected by drying temperature under the tested conditions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The analysis of averaged contour shapes showed that, although shrinkage occurs from the beginning of drying, deformation appears at the final stages, when the free moisture fraction is below 0.2.

A flow simulation software, ANSYS-Fluent has been used to predict the profile of air distribution in drying chamber. A spatial homogeneity of air distribution was found. To validate the designed geometry of dryer and its performance evaluation, experiments were conducted using potatoes (slices, 4\u00a0mm thickness) as drying material. The result, expressed as drying curves for all food buckets, showed high R2 value. The simulated results of airflow were compared with experimental measured data.

In addition, the color and texture values were similar in both cases. These results suggest that the reduction of the acrylamide content during processing of tortilla chips and other tortilla based foods thermally processed might be modified by factors such as moisture content, aw, and the physical state of water in the tortilla.

The dynamic characteristics of the spout fluidized bed and the effect of spout elevation on the particle movement were revealed, which could be used to improve the uniformity of particle mixing and microwave heating. The mathematical model demonstrated that the spout fluidization process includes isolated, merged and transitional jets and the fluidization at a specific spout gas velocity has a start-up stage and a quasi-steady fluidization stage. The spout velocity was an important factor controlling particle status in the spout fluidized bed and a critical velocity was identified for effect transition of the flow pattern. There was an approximately linear correlation between the jet penetration depth and the spout velocity. When the spout gas velocity increased up to the critical velocity region, the pressure drop tended to convert from negative pressure to positive pressure.",

This process also increased the molecular weight of the SPC and improved the soluble aggregate protein yield.

Furthermore, the total isoflavones in the soy protein product were decreased to 70.0\u00a0mg/kg.

Instead of selecting different sets of optimum wavelengths for these chemical constituents, only a set of optimum wavelengths were selected with the proposed technique for fat, protein and water. At first, sensitive wavelengths were identified using combinations of UVE and SPA for fat (910, 961, 988, 1011, 1064, 1084, 1192 and 1212\u00a0nm), protein (921, 944, 947, 971, 1021, 1091, 1269 and 1396\u00a0nm) and water (910, 961, 994, 1058, 1131, 1195, 1198 and 1312\u00a0nm), and merged into instrumental optimal wavelengths (IOW). Then, on the basis of the built optimization formulations and CSA, only seven wavelengths (1021, 1084, 1091, 1192, 1212, 1269 and 1396\u00a0nm) were selected as the prediction optimum wavelengths (POW) for predicting fat, protein and water contents in lamb meats. The multiple linear regression (MLR) models were developed to relate absorbance spectra of lamb samples and their chemical constituents (i.e. fat, protein and water contents) using POW. The fat, protein and water contents were predicted with correlation coefficient of calibration (Rc) of 0.95, 0.80 and 0.91, and residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 4.13, 1.31 and 2.53, respectively.

     "abstract": "A mechanistic model for baking of leavened aerated food is proposed. The model accounts for heat conduction, moisture diffusion, diffusion of CO2 that is produced by fermentation, and the resistance to bubble expansion by the viscoelasticity of the dough which is described by Oldroyd B constitutive equation. Unsteady state heat conduction and moisture diffusion equations are solved accounting for bubble expansion due to heating, evaporation of moisture as well as diffusion of CO2 that is produced by fermentation to obtain the evolution of temperature, moisture and air volume fraction profiles as well as dough rise. The bubble expansion due to CO2 diffusion is coupled to temperature and moisture profiles. The model predicts that the growth of bubble exhibits a lag time followed by an exponential growth phase consistent with experimental observations. Eventhough the surface region is more expanded initially, at longer times, it is found to be more dense. The calculated air volume fraction profiles at longer times indicated an expanded inner region of more or less uniform density and a denser surface crust region of decreasing air volume fraction (or increasing density). The thickness of the crust region is found to increase with baking time. The average air volume fraction is found to increase with time because of the combined effects of air expansion as well as CO2 diffusion. The model predictions of dough rise as well as force exerted by the rising dough compare well with the experimental data (Singh and Bhattacharya, 2005; Romano et al., 2007).",

     "abstract": "The sterilization process in the oil palm mill is a crucial step in extracting and yielding good quality oil. However, this process requires a vast amount of steam to be released to the atmosphere and with that, several attempts in replacing the current steaming sterilization process by means of dry(oven) heating, microwave heating and the invention of a continuous sterilizer were carried out by researchers to provide a greener technology for this purpose. This paper reviewed among the methods and past invention proposed and it can be concluded that the oil yield and the quality depend very much on two major factors, that is the pre-processing conditions and the sterilization and extraction methods used. Bunch strippability is enhanced through the use of continuous sterilizers of low temperature subjected to the fruits. Thorough comparison studies should be done on the current sterilization method and the new techniques introduced since both the current and new methods gave equally good benefits.",

In this study, three hyperspectral imaging (HSI) configurations coupled with two multivariate image analysis techniques are compared for detection of fecal contamination on spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea). Fluorescence imaging in the visible region with ultra violet (UV) and violet excitation sources, and reflectance imaging in the visible to near-infrared regions were investigated. Partial least squares discriminant analysis and two band ratio analysis techniques were used to compare these HSI configurations. High detection accuracy was found for the two fluorescence HSI configurations compared to the visible/near infrared HSI. Both fluorescence HSI configurations had 100% detection rates for fecal contamination up to 1:10 dilution level and violet HSI had 99% and 87% detection rates for 1:20 and 1:30 levels, respectively. Results indicated that fluorescence imaging with the violet excitation performed superior to HSI with UV excitation for detection of a range of diluted fecal contamination on leafy greens. 5% or less false positives were observed for the fluorescence HSI configurations and were associated with yellow hue on the leaves. On-line detection of fecal contamination on leaves has the potential to reduce the cases of food borne illnesses and their associated costs.",

Images were obtained using a dryer equipped with perpendicular dual-view computer vision system (CVS) at hot air drying (HAD) temperatures of 50\u221290\u00a0\u00b0C and superheated steam drying (SSD) temperatures of 110\u2212120\u00a0\u00b0C. Three drying medium velocities in the range of 1\u22122\u00a0m/s were adjusted for each drying temperature. Unlike the drying medium velocity, the drying medium temperature had a significant effect on the visual texture parameters of the shrimp batch. The zero-order and fractional conversion models along with a modified Arrhenius model were found as the best models for explaining the kinetics of the visual texture features and the temperature dependency of their constants, respectively. Eventually, the linear and cubic regression models satisfactorily correlated the image texture features with the moisture ratio and geometrical attributes of the samples, respectively.",

     "abstract": "Fruit classification is a difficult challenge due to the numerous types of fruits. In order to recognize fruits more accurately, we proposed a hybrid classification method based on fitness-scaled chaotic artificial bee colony (FSCABC) algorithm and feedforward neural network (FNN). First, fruits images were acquired by a digital camera, and then the background of each image were removed by split-and-merge algorithm. We used a square window to capture the fruits, and download the square images to 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256. Second, the color histogram, texture and shape features of each fruit image were extracted to compose a feature space. Third, principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensions of the feature space. Finally, the reduced features were sent to the FNN, the weights/biases of which were trained by the FSCABC algorithm. We also used a stratified K-fold cross validation technique to enhance the generation ability of FNN. The experimental results of the 1653 color fruit images from the 18 categories demonstrated that the FSCABC\u2013FNN achieved a classification accuracy of 89.1%. The classification accuracy was higher than Genetic Algorithm\u2013FNN (GA\u2013FNN) with 84.8%, Particle Swarm Optimization\u2013FNN (PSO\u2013FNN) with 87.9%, ABC\u2013FNN with 85.4%, and kernel support vector machine with 88.2%.

Partition coefficients (K) followed the same trend but were below 1, except for HPMC at 40\u00a0\u00b0C, which implies that, at equilibrium, a lower amount of nisin was liberated in water\u2013ethanol solution. A higher antibacterial effect against Listeria monocytogenes CIP 82110 and Staphylococcus aureus CIP 4.83 was observed with HPMC and SC films containing nisin due to strong interactions (hydratation) between the medium and the film.

We utilised the glass-filament single droplet drying technique to monitor the thermal-moisture drying histories of MPC droplets and used the Reaction Engineering Approach (REA) to model their drying kinetics. Across the range of solids content tested, the rate of moisture removal and final moisture content of dried MPC particles achieved were relatively similar. However, increase in solids content of MPC droplets led to reduced shrinkage and increased rate of temperature rise during drying. The in situ rehydration study indicated slower rehydration with the increase of concentration. Surface composition of dried MPC particles was analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the findings indicated the importance of bulk and surface compositions in determining droplet drying behaviour and particle formation during drying.",

Generally, mechanical properties were improved by the addition of hydrophilic nanoclay (i.e., Cloisite Na+) in the range of 0.5\u20135% (w/w). The lowest water vapour permeability was observed for films incorporated with Cloisite Na+ and Cloisite 20A at a level of 1% (w/w) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The lowest L* and the highest \u0394E* values were observed (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) when the film was incorporated with Cloisite 15A at 10% (w/w). Generally, b* value (yellowness) of resulting films increased with increasing amount of all nanoclays (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). All films became less transparent with increasing levels of nanoclay incorporated (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Wide angle X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic analyses revealed the intercalated/exfoliated structure of nanocomposite gelatin-based films incorporated with hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanoclays. Homogeneity and smoothness of film surface decreased with the addition of both nanoclays as revealed by SEM micrographs. Thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analyses indicated that the incorporation of nanoclays enhanced the rigidity and heat stability of the gelatin-based films differently, depending on the types of MMT-nanoclay used. Thus, the types and levels of nanoclay incorporated directly affected the properties of tilapia skin gelatin films.",

Identification of the key parameters affecting the airflow distribution has been done either experimentally (using intrusive point-wise or bulk measurement techniques) or numerically. The detailed information provided by the use of computational fluid dynamic models has facilitated unique opportunities to investigate alternative system designs, without the need for expensive and time consuming experiments. This study provides a review of the techniques available to measure airflow (thermal and rotatory vane anemometry, pressure differential devices, tracer gases, LDA and PIV). Their advantages and disadvantages (accuracy, resolution, application range, cost, and ease of use) as well as their application in the validation of numerical models are reviewed.

Almond surface area is often estimated from an equivalent sphere, but the sphere-based estimate only predicted 60% of the variation in measured surface area. An empirical model was created to predict surface area (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.74), based on the almond variety, as well as length, width, and mass after rehydration.

The method was a powerful tool to reconstruct bread microstructure; a perfect match between lineal-path function of reference and reconstructed images were obtained. The reconstructed images progressively improve, compared to the reference, increasing the number of LPFs used during reconstruction. The use of LPFs in different direction did not allowed to obtain a perfect match between the bread and the reconstructed images because, LPF did not contain sufficient microstructure information however, the essential features of bread were captured proving the possibility to reconstruct food microstructure.",

The fine insoluble fibres also produced breads with higher specific volumes and lower hardness than controls; however, coarser insoluble fibres gave rise to breads with lower specific volumes and greater hardness than controls.

The mean particle diameter had a minimum value at an intermediate vitamin E-to-orange oil ratio in the oil phase: d32\u00a0=\u00a00.13\u00a0\u03bcm for lecithin and 0.12\u00a0\u03bcm for quillaja saponin at 50% vitamin E. The mean particle diameter decreased with increasing surfactant concentration for both surfactants, with lower levels of quillaja saponin being required to form small droplets. The effect of pH, ionic strength, and temperature on the physical stability of the nanoemulsions was also investigated. Both surfactants formed unstable nanoemulsions at pH 2, which was attributed to loss of electrostatic repulsion due to a reduction in droplet charge. Emulsion instability was also observed at >100\u00a0mM NaCl for lecithin and \u2a7e400\u00a0mM NaCl for quillaja saponin, which was attributed to electrostatic screening. Both systems were stable at temperatures from 30 to 90\u00a0\u00b0C (pH 7), i.e., no particle growth or creaming was observed. These results provide useful information about the emulsifying and stabilizing capacities of natural surfactants intended for use in the food and other industries.",

Ice cubes from 10\u00a0wt% sucrose were partially melted in this apparatus at 4 temperature and 4 stirring speeds. At the lower temperature with relatively faster stirring speed, the initially-melted fractions effectively contained the higher concentration of solute than the later-melted fractions. The partial ice-melting technique was combined with progressive freeze-concentration (PFC) to improve the yield in PFC. Apple juice with 13.7\u00a0\u00b0Brix was concentrated up to 25.5\u00a0\u00b0Brix by PFC using a tubular ice system. Then, the partial ice-melting was applied for the ice formed by PFC to improve the yield from 63.8% to 85% by recovering the initial 30% melted fraction. The partial ice-melting was also applied to pear (La France) juice flavor condensate. After 2.36 times concentration of flavor component (butyl acetate) by PFC, the yield was improved from 86.7% to 95% by recovering the initial 35% melted fraction in the partial ice-melting process. Partial ice-melting technique will overcome the major drawback of PFC, in which the yield decreases with an increase in solute concentration because of the solute inclusion in the ice.",

Spherical geometry was assumed with radial diffusion, and a local mass balance coupled with an overall heat balance in the soybeans was solved by finite difference and the Euler method, respectively. The heat transfer coefficient was estimated from the energy balance using experimental drying rates. Values varied from 176 to 312\u00a0W/(m2\u00a0\u00b0C). The effective diffusion coefficient was proposed to be a function of temperature and moisture content. The temperature dependence was described by an Arrhenius relationship, while the moisture content dependence, found by extending the shrinkage behavior to a local level. The Arrhenius parameters were estimated by solving an inverse problem for the whole dataset. The activation energy was 51.9\u00a0kJ/(mol\u00a0K), with a pre-exponential factor of 0.0237\u00a0m2/s.

The dual purpose of the proposed modelling scheme is not only to classify meat samples in the respective quality class (i.e. fresh, semi-fresh and spoiled), but also to predict their associated microbiological population directly from FTIR spectra.

The results of the hemagglutinating activity and the intrinsic fluorescence assays indicated that the thermal inactivation is associated with the unfolding of the protein. Based on the two-way analysis of variance, the heating temperature and treatment time significantly affected the stability of the lectin during thermal treatments. Analysis of kinetic data suggested that the thermal stability of the lectin followed first-order reaction kinetics. The activation energy for the lectin was 78.80\u00a0kJ/mol. This higher activation energy suggested hydrophobic stability and thermal sensitivity of the lectin during thermal processing. Additionally, a high temperature and short treatment time might eliminate the anti-nutritional functions of the lectin.

With increasing time and mixing speed most of the textural properties of starch gels obtained from texture profile analysis and residual modulus of Maxwell model obtained from stress relaxation data decreased.

The images of starch gels taken by scanning electron microscopy indicated that with increasing the time and speed of mixing, honeycomb-like structure of the gels formed larger cells with thicker cell walls. Intrinsic viscosity of the samples decreased with increasing heating time and mixing speed indicating depolymerisation of starch biopolymers. Rapid Visco Analyzer data showed reduction in cold-water viscosity of starch gels with increasing time and mixing speed.

In our previous work, an initial dynamic in vitro rat stomach (DIVRS) system was created to investigate its digestion capacity of casein powder (water suspension) using an angled plate driven by a motor and an eccentric shaft to create pulsing compression on a polymeric rat stomach model. This indicated that the system was effective in showing the correct trends of the digestion and emptying of solid or semi-solid food matter with small particle size. In this paper, raw rice particles (larger size) were used as model food to study their digestive behaviours with the aid of the same DIVRS and a simple stirred tank reactor (STR). These results were then compared with the in vivo experiments of the living rats. Moreover, the effect of rotating speeds of the impeller in the STR on the digestive behaviours of raw rice particles was also investigated. Better repeatability and similar digestive behaviours were achieved in both the STR and the DIVRS than that could be obtained in the living rats. Both of the STR and DIVRS were effective in reducing the large raw rice particles into small ones. However, the digestive efficiency and buffering ability in vitro were lower than that in vivo due to less sufficient mixing of ingested materials. The stirring speed had a significant influence on the particle digestion in the STR; so, stirring speed must be considered in terms of using STR as an in vitro digestion system for studying digestive behaviours in the GI tract. The mixing behaviour needs to be quantified and understood. Further improvement has to be made by setting up more powerful contractions within the walls on the DIVRS to make it more attractive for practical applications.",

Systems were formulated following a factorial design including three concentrations of starch, three of caramel and three of protein. Both, the formula and storage time, influenced at different degree the analyzed physicochemical properties and flow behavior. Moisture was stable, while a decreasing in pH and brightness, an increasing in acidity, redness and yellowness, were observed. The non-Newtonian response was adjusted to the Herschel\u2013Bulkley and Bingham plastic equations at the upward and downward flow curves, respectively. The custards consistency increased with the addition of formula components and decreased with storage, while the shear thinning nature of the fresh systems declined with storage as a result of changes in gel structure. Quantification of the thixotropic area completed the rheological analysis of the custards as non-Newtonian time dependent food materials.",

     "abstract": "The thermal conductivity probe is widely used to determine the thermal conductivity of foods; however, its accuracy is limited by a number of factors. In this paper the influence of particle size (relative to probe diameter) on measurement accuracy was examined by measuring the thermal conductivity of sucrose of varying grades, and coffee (both whole beans and ground) using two different methods; the thermal conductivity probe and a transient comparative method. Results showed that the measurement methods were in agreement for the small particulates; however, for the larger particulates the probe method appeared to under-predict thermal conductivity. A possible explanation for this observation is that the probe causes a local variation in the porosity of the sample due to the alteration of the packing density. A suggested rule-of-thumb is that thermal conductivity probes may not be suitable for particulate materials where the particle diameter is greater than the probe diameter.",

To study the reliability of the pilot plant, different malaxation conditions were tested in an industrial environment: the free acidity, common quality indicators of olive oil (e.g., peroxide value, total phenols), volatile compounds and sensory evaluation of the olive oil extracted were investigated. The results were correlated with the detected oxygen concentration during the malaxation process. The pilot plant proved to be a highly robust device capable of performing fast in-line measurements of oxygen concentration, controlling in real-time the oxygenation of the olive paste, and allowing the identification of a correlation between the oxygen concentration and the olive oil quality. The experimental tests also demonstrated that a controlled oxygen supply promotes the production of volatile compounds responsible for a balanced oil, avoiding the excessive oxidation of the oil. This work is aimed at contributing to the development of monitoring and controlling systems for olive oil extraction equipment, and providing design parameters to define a new malaxer machine model.",

The coffee mass fraction had the greatest effect on average distribution coefficient. The Chen model parameters to predict the average distribution coefficient and the concentration index were found. A logistical model was proposed to predict the concentration reached in successive stages, which tended to 35% at the studied intervals. The model showed an adjusted regression coefficient of 0.98 and the experimental values were within the 95% confidence intervals.

The properties of the film forming dispersions (particle size distribution, \u03b6-potential and rheological behaviour) were also analysed. As the BM increased in the blend, both the average particle size and the apparent viscosity of the film forming dispersions were reduced. The low degree of compatibility between both materials resulted in heterogeneous structures, where an interpenetrated protein phase in the starch matrix was observed as a result of the protein gelation when BM was heated. This affected the mechanical and barrier properties giving rise to more resistant and extensible, and less permeable films than in non-heated BM. Only films formulated with heated BM exhibited antioxidant activity, probably due to the release of the antioxidant peptides during thermal treatment of proteins.

Although the value of the minimum inhibitory concentration depended on microorganism and temperature, L. innocua was always more carvacrol-resistant than E. coli K12. The lag time and the maximum specific growth rate achieved at different carvacrol concentrations and temperatures were calculated at non-inhibitory doses. The lower the temperature or the higher the carvacrol concentration, the greater the lag time and the smaller the growth rate. These results indicate that carvacrol can inhibit or slow E. coli K12 and L. innocua growth, especially at low temperatures, because synergism was observed between the two factors. Consequently, carvacrol could be an effective hurdle when temperature or other factors compromise the microbial safety of minimally processed ready-to-eat foods.",

Sodium alginate in contrast showed only a small influence on RI. The shape of ice crystals in the \u03ba-carrageenan solution were similar to the shapes found in AFP solutions which suggests that \u03ba-carrageenan may act in a way comparable to AFPs.

Addition of an endoxylanase with a higher selectivity for water-unextractable arabinoxylans and an endoxylanase with a higher selectivity for water-extractable arabinoxylans both resulted in a significant reduction in torque.

On the whole, pre-clarification treatments that included PVPP exhibited a higher overall adsorption capacity, especially of low molecular weight phenolics. The best results with regard to both the fouling behavior of the UF membrane and the juice clarity were achieved by sequential application of PVPP and bentonite.

This approach, based on short-wave infrared imaging, provides excellent image contrast between the fruit surface and delaminated skin, which allows significant simplification of image processing algorithm and reduction of computational power requirements. The proposed method employs a very efficient training procedure to produce a normalized gray scale histogram and its corresponding skin threshold for each quality class. By histogram comparison, the test fruit is assigned to one of the four quality classes and an adaptive threshold is calculated for segmenting skin delamination areas from the fruit surface. The final quality grade is determined according to the fruit size and the percentage of delaminated skin. Experiment was performed in a packing facility in Arizona, USA.

Using a custom-built ultrasound device, the technique was applied to navel oranges to relate ultrasonic measurements with physical measurements taken via destructive methods. For a sample of randomly selected navel oranges, a high level of correlation was found between ultrasonic measurements and the density of the fruit, allowing the relative water content of oranges to be non-destructively determined regardless of individual physical characteristics such as size and maturity. When applied to a sample of navel oranges over a period of nine days, the ultrasonic measurements were found to be highly correlated to the firmness of the oranges, providing a non-destructive method to replace traditional destructive methods currently used to monitor orange maturation.",

No significant changes to the surface composition (fat, protein and lactose) of the sonicated and non-sonicated powder samples occurred during storage. The microstructure of non-sonicated powder samples showed the appearance of particle agglomerates upon storage, whereas this was not observed with sonicated samples. Importantly, it is shown that sonication prior to drying can increase powder stability during storage and delay the loss of powder solubility. When powders are reconstituted, the increase in solution viscosity that is normally associated with long term storage is also slowed. This is beneficial to industry where powder stability is important for reconstitution and use in the manufacture of secondary dairy products.",

Radio frequency (RF) heating could be applied to eliminate pathogens and reduce the damage to food quality. However, non-uniform heating in RF treatment is still a major problem for developing a food pasteurization process. In this study, commercial peanut butter in a cylindrical jar was used as a model of low moisture food for studying the RF heating uniformity. Polyetherimide (PEI) was placed around peanut butter samples to provide better heating uniformity. A computer simulation model was established with COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae, and experiments with a RF machine (27.12\u00a0MHz, 6\u00a0kW) were performed to validate the effectiveness of the PEI assisting method. Top surface and vertical cross-sectional temperature distributions of peanut butter in a cylindrical container were obtained with an infrared camera, and temperatures at 18 locations inside the container were measured with T type thermocouples. The results showed that PEI assistance reduced the difference between maximum and minimum temperature of top surface from 13 to 7\u00a0\u00b0C and cross-sectional surface temperatures from 28 to 18\u00a0\u00b0C. The same strategy was used on wheat flour and heating uniformity was also improved. The computer model was then used with a group of 9 jars of peanut butter to RF processing, and PEI assistance was also found to be effective in improving heating uniformity. Thus, PEI assisted RF heating has potential as a pasteurization intervention for low moisture foods after optimization of this process by the food industry.",

Experimental data for purslane stored at 0 and 5\u00a0\u00b0C, apples and broccoli stored at 5\u00a0\u00b0C, as well as literature data for \u2018Lisbon\u2019 lemon and \u2018Palazzelli\u2019 mandarin samples were used to validate the model, which is consistent with the phenol changes under all of the studied conditions. By estimating model parameters, individually or as group, the storage temperature did not affect the de novo synthesis of phenols but did affect the oxidative degradation for purslane samples. For apples and broccoli samples, biological variability was very important and affected the initial phenolic content and synthesis. Moreover the model also explained the phenolic variation on mandarin segments and on cut lemons. The type of cut for lemon samples had a significant effect on the rate of synthesis of phenols, with an increase of 1.8-fold being observed for the \u00bd slice compared to the slices. The model may be a useful tool for obtaining a better understanding of the effects of processing and storage conditions on the changes in the phenolic content and improving the shelf life prediction of fresh-cut produce.",

We proposed an easier way to simulate the temperatures of the liquid inside which free convection occurred during heating. The appropriate value of the thermal conductivity of the liquid material for microwave cooking was validated by the experiment. On the basis of simulated temperature profiles and the parameters deduced from Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experimental data, the time-dependent degrees of protein denaturation during cooking were also estimated.The temperature and denaturation information were finally formatted in Femap and animated so that they could be investigated easily.",

     "abstract": "Different studies have emphasized the importance of cooling in oil absorption after frying, suggesting that the largest proportion of oil is sucked into the crust after the product is removed from the oil. Microscopy has been a powerful tool to support these determinations, but, direct observation of fluxes has not yet been possible. The aim of this research was to develop an experimental procedure based on the use of glass micromodels to get direct evidence of transport phenomena during oil immersion for the first time. To do so, micromodels were saturated with water and immersed in oil at 190\u00a0\u00b0C. Fluids displacements were monitored using video-microscopy as well as fluorescence microscopy. Results showed that only a small fraction of oil penetrated during the immersion period, due to the vigorous escape of bubbles. Once the release of steam stopped, after some initial cooling, oil-uptake began abruptly and oil movement into the pores could be clearly identified. Oil absorption ended as soon as the oil film lost continuity, due to air penetration. Overall, the developed technique illustrates how glass micromodels may be used to visualize and provide valuable information to understand key transport phenomena during processing.",

The mechanisms that direct water vapor adsorption by the theoretical study of enthalpy\u2013entropy compensation were also evaluated. The product reached the equilibrium phases from 144\u00a0h of storage and the temperature increase from 15\u00a0\u00b0C to 45\u00a0\u00b0C reduced the adsorptive capacity. The Gibbs free energy was negative under all conditions, indicating that the adsorption phenomenon is a spontaneous process.

In this paper, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and area change rate (ACR) of the spectra of reference standard were used to evaluate the Vis/NIR spectral system. Two different systems with different light sources (LS1 and LS2) were considered. The results showed that the SNR recorded at each selected wavelength in the condition of LS1 was higher than that recorded in the condition of LS2, and the ACR between 550\u00a0nm and 920\u00a0nm in the condition of LS1 was smaller than that of LS2. Meanwhile, in the verification experiment by calibration and cross-validation analysis using fruits, the results obtained in the condition of LS1 were all better than that of LS2, and the best results were correlation coefficient of calibration (rc)\u00a0=\u00a00.948, root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC)\u00a0=\u00a00.299\u00b0Brix, correlation coefficient of cross-validation (rcv)\u00a0=\u00a00.924, and root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV)\u00a0=\u00a00.359\u00b0Brix.

All the emulsions considered here exhibit the same trends in terms of lubrication behaviour, where little boundary lubrication is observed at the entrainment speed considered. The volume of dispersed aqueous phase affects overall tribology of oil continuous emulsions via an increase in their dynamic viscosity. Increasing the phase volume leads to an increase in friction in the elastohydrodynamic regime whereas the lubrication in the boundary regime is improved. Elastohydrodynamic lubrication is independent of the aqueous phase composition and the type of emulsifier present at the water\u2013oil interface. These parameters affect boundary lubrication of emulsion systems exhibiting droplet size bigger than the elastohydrodynamic oil film thickness.

The drying kinetics were modeled by considering the diffusion theory, negligible shrinkage and cubic geometry. In the dried apple, total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacity were measured.The application of power ultrasound sped up the drying kinetics at every temperature tested, achieving drying time reductions of up to 77%, which was linked to the improvement in diffusion and convective mass transport. In overall terms, ultrasound application involved a greater degradation of polyphenol and flavonoid contents and a reduction of the antioxidant capacity, which was related to the cell disruption caused by the mechanical stress of acoustic waves.",

     "abstract": "The inactivation performance of a coiled tube reactor was investigated in respect to hydraulic parameters and the impact of flow conditions and absorption on the UV-C energy delivery. Data of the residence time distributions using tracer step response indicate full use of the reactor volume and flow behavior close to ideal plug flow with increasing Reynolds number. Based on the hydraulic characteristics of the coiled tube, the used reactor appears to have an effective design for inactivation. Even though the hydraulic characteristics were similar to plug flow conditions, the attenuation of the UV-C energy delivery due to the presence of absorptive compounds in the liquid remains an influencing parameter on the inactivation performance. In addition, the UV-C dose was evaluated by calculation of the theoretical maximum UV-C energy input and actinometric measurements using iodide/iodate actinometry. Both dose specifications were evaluated for their suitability to describe inactivation kinetics of Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 in clear and absorptive liquid. Since the flow influences the inactivation performance in absorptive liquids, actinometric dose is suitable to describe inactivation kinetics in absorptive liquids.",

The resulting microcapsules measured 48.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter, had 5% moisture content, and contained 1.32\u00a0mg cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), 2.83\u00a0mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 48.52\u00a0nmol Fe (II) equivalents per gram powder. Sorption data obeyed Guggenheim\u2013Anderson\u2013De Boer isotherm. Storage tests revealed first-order degradation kinetics for monomeric anthocyanins, a two-fold increase in total phenolics and slight increase in antioxidant capacity. Exposure to light was comparable to storage at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, but slightly more severe in decomposing monomeric anthocyanins.

The potato was selected as a model tissue. Computer model, based on electroporation theory, was developed to simulate different strategies of E value changes. In the experimental part of this work, the PEF treatment was applied to disk-shaped and sliced samples using a laboratory compression chamber, equipped with a PEF-treatment system. The experiments were done using PEF generator that provided pulses of near-rectangular shape, the pulse duration was ti\u00a0=\u00a01000\u00a0\u03bcs, the value of E was varied within 200 and 800\u00a0V/cm, and the total time of PEF treatment, tPEF, was varied within 0 and 0.1\u00a0s. The electrical conductivity disintegration index, Z, was used for characterization of the PEF-induced damage of potato tissue. Both theory and experiment predicted the minimum power consumption Wo at the optimal value of Eo\u00a0\u2248\u00a0400\u00a0V/cm. The computer simulation predicted that application of protocols with time-variable electric fields would allow optimization of PEF treatment with initial electric field Ei deviating from the optimal value Eo. PEF experiments revealed that exponential increase of E values can be useful at small initial electric field strengths, E\u00a0<\u00a0Eo, as far as it allows significant improvement of PEF-treatment efficiency. The PEF experiments with pressing of potato slices have shown that PEF treatment before pressing was more efficient than treatment during the pressing, and the specific energy consumption for the both samples was approximately the same (W\u00a0\u2248\u00a07.5\u00a0kJ/kg).",

Such approach consists in identifying and defining the critical and quality times of the process, and to find a technological solution to make equal those times. Then, an optimum process presents the same critical and quality times. As case of study, the conventional bread baking process is analysed, where the critical time is the time necessary to complete the dough/crumb transformation, while the quality time is given by the target value of browning development. The use of infrared heating as additional energy source, besides convection and radiation, is proposed here to obtain optimum processes. The proposed solution gives good results in comparison with conventional baking, improving process outputs such as baking time, weight loss, thermal input, and energy input. Finally, the generalisation of the approach is discussed.",

Therefore, this study examined the effect of different tribometer measurement parameters on the magnitude and fluctuation of normal force, gap height, and friction coefficient. The instantaneous values of normal force and gap height, and the extent of fluctuation of those measurements, were affected by multiple instrument parameters. Friction coefficient values were not significantly affected by instrumental parameters; however, fluctuations in normal force and gap height can contribute to data variation, reducing measurement precision and adding confounding factors to data.",

Impact of electroporation on membrane permeability is theoretically estimated and elucidated via the extraction\u2013consolidation model; results are compared with experimental kinetics for validation and evaluation of model performance.

Gravimetric moisture sorption tests were performed on the spray-dried powders processed under these conditions and compared with X-ray powder diffraction and modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) analyses to measure the degree of crystallinity.

The drying characteristics and the qualities of the dried chopped garlic in terms of the allicin content, volatile oil content and colour were investigated. HA and heat pump (HP) drying were carried out at a temperature of 50\u00a0\u00b0C. The far-infrared radiation (FIR) power levels used in combination with HP drying were 250, 350 and 450\u00a0W. A coupled heat and mass transfer model was developed to estimate the effective moisture diffusivity (Deff) and to predict the evolution of the moisture content and internal temperature of chopped garlic. The experimental results showed that an increase in the FIR power resulted in a faster decrease in the moisture content and a shorter drying time. The amounts of allicin in samples dried by HP-FIR at different FIR powers were not significantly different; their percentage losses were about 20% higher than those obtained from HA or HP drying. However, the volatile oil contents in all dried samples were similar to those of fresh samples. HP drying provided garlic powder with the brightest colour as manifested by the highest values of L and the hue angle. The values of L and the hue angle had a decreasing trend when the FIR power increased. In addition to quality issues, the developed model could estimate the Deff of chopped garlic rather well.

Binding stability of dye on the film and its redox activity were confirmed by UV\u2013vis spectrophotometry. Reduction kinetics of MB shows a response fast enough to work as a spoilage indicator against samples of liquid milk in different preservation states. This performance also describes these devices as suitable sensors to be used in the development of smart packagings.",

The deposition mechanism onto the heat transfer surface involves the denaturation and aggregation of \u03b2-lactoglobulin. In this work, a 2-D CFD analysis was conducted to simulate locally the heat-induced protein denaturation mechanisms. Firstly, we present various intermediate validations of the ability of the numerical model to capture the hydrodynamics, by showing the similarity of CFD results and experimental data. Finally, the close agreement between the denaturation level obtained by CFD and that obtained experimentally indicates the ability of the numerical model adopted to simulate the chemical reaction. The analysis of the species present in the plate heat exchanger is related to the deposit mass distribution along the heat exchanger using CFD data. It has been shown that the unfolded species are deposit precursors and that the distribution of the deposit is correlated to this source.",

Hyperspectral cubes were acquired at the second and fourth segments of prawn and their mean spectral data were extracted. The quantitative relationship between the spectral data and their corresponding reference mechanical properties (measured by Instron universal testing machine) were established by partial least square regression (PLSR) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) algorithms, respectively. Successive projections algorithm (SPA) was carried out to select the most important and effective wavelengths, which was an optimization process for improving the performance of established models. Then the optimized models were built using PLSR and LS-SVM based on the selected wavelengths and their performances were compared to find the best model for predicting mechanical properties of prawn. As a result, the SPA-LS-SVM model was considered as the best predictive model to determine the hardness, gumminess and chewiness values of prawn with correlation coefficient of prediction (RP) of 0.8489, 0.8096, and 0.8596 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.1465, 0.1445, and 0.1258, respectively.

The technique uses ultrasound to generate and measure shear waves. These waves do not propagate in liquids and their velocity of propagation depends on the viscoelastic characteristics of the medium. Hence, they can be used to identify the beginning of coagulation and subsequently to monitor the evolution of the coagulum firmness. Our results showed this technique is sensitive to changes of the medium structure during coagulation. It also proved reproducible and sensitive to different coagulation conditions.

The objective was to compare the behavior of free ions in solution with those trapped within the alginate matrix while being submitted to electromagnetic radiation. The beads were characterized before and after heating by texture profiles, differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). During microwave heating, the presence of zinc and iron increased the inner temperature of the system; however calcium did not show the same behavior.

Increased mass losses were observed as a function of time and temperature, but approximately 50% smaller mass losses were always measured for PLA stereocomplex as compared to the corresponding regular PLLA material. The stability of the stereocomplex material was, thus, significantly higher. Microwave heating increased the mass loss as compared to the conventional heating at the same time and temperature. This effect was especially significant when 10% ethanol was used as food simulant instead of water. The amount of water-soluble migrants was in most cases under the detection limits, but when heating temperature was increased to 95\u00a0\u00b0C, ESI-MS revealed the formation of homologous series of linear lactic acid oligomers.

Critical wavelengths were selected using correlation analysis based on the spectral profiles of pork samples. The visual IMF flecks on both sides of pork chops were extracted using the wide line detector at the selected critical wavelengths. The proportion of IMF fleck areas (PFA) at critical wavelengths was used for modeling to predict the IMF content of pork.

Three different multilinear models were obtained using the stepwise procedure with different first entry variable of the initial model. A 3-component PLS model was developed for prediction of the IMF content. The PLS model outperformed the three multilinear models. The coefficients of determination (R2) of the PLS model on the calibration set and validation set were 0.94 and 0.97, respectively, and the adjusted R2 were 0.92 and 0.93, respectively.

Because the majority of these studies use empirical measurements, it is difficult to quantitatively compare their results. Although the effects of surface hydrophobicity, roughness, and modulus on friction coefficient measurements have been examined, there has been little study of variability due to differences in measurement parameters. Therefore, this study examined the effect of different measurement parameters on friction coefficient magnitude and variation. Tribological data were affected by multiple measurement parameters.

The rheological behaviour of suspensions of pimento pur\u00e9e with added dietary fibers was studied before and after sterilisation to prevent the separation for sedimentation. The experimental data were fitted to power law being the behaviour index similar to before sterilisation. The texture of pimento pure with fibers was determined at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. Sterilisation influenced the texture.",

Sensory analysis confirmed that this was accomplished.Through the pervaporation process, three flavor constituents of beer (isobutyl alcohol, ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate) were analyzed in detail. Selectivities were roughly predicted by an easy model based on the Hildebrand solubility parameters for the polymer and the species in the solution. According to the model, a polymer will transmit a species almost perfectly if their solubility parameters coincide.This model helps to calculate the relative selectivities from solubility parameters and can provide guidance when choosing the membrane for specific separation requirements in food processing or other separation problems where pervaporation can be of great help.",

Kinetic extractions were done at 15\u00a0MPa and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, varying solvent flow rate, particle diameter and extraction bed volume. The highest extraction rates were obtained for high solvent flow rates, low particle diameters and low extraction bed volume. These results can be explained by the high importance of the convective phenomenon under these conditions. A classical model based on the concept of intact and broken cells was applied to experimental SFE curves, and model parameters were obtained. Two modeling strategies were used: (1) simultaneous fitting creating a set of parameters for pairs of duplicates, (2) multiple fitting that adjusts a single value for the solute concentration in unbroken cell for curves with equal particle diameter. These fits allowed estimating the convective mass transfer coefficient for each condition, and the respective values of the experimental Sherwood number. Experimental data was used to calculate dimensionless numbers of Reynolds and Schmidt for each condition. A second series of mathematical modeling was performed using these dimensionless numbers, which allowed proposing new mass transfer correlations. These new equations were based on the existence of forced and free convection, although the importance of the latter was small. The convective coefficients calculated with the correlations were compared to those obtained from the model, and a good coherence was found between both.",

At relatively high sugar concentration, significant decrease in ions removal is observed. The increase of current density and applied voltage had little impact on ions removal and lead to current efficiency and pH reduction.

Cleaning is by a pulsed flow generated by a fast switching solenoid valve, which is connected to a nozzle in front of the filter medium. In the study, parameters like frequency, velocity of the pulse, pulse duration and distance between nozzle and filter medium are varied and it will be discussed which operating conditions achieve the best cleaning results. The aim of the cleaning method is to increase the cleaning grades of the filter media, to reduce the consumption of the cleaning solution and, hence, to minimize the process costs. In this paper, also a dimensionless operation number is developed, by means of which the cleaning behavior of different filter media can be predicted. The investigations showed that the cleaning grade increases with decreasing intervals between two pulses and that the pulse duration has no significant influence on the cleaning grade. In summary it can be stated, that cleaning by pulsed flow is a promising cleaning method for filter media.",

However, the high viscosity of EW that is caused by the fibrillar protein ovomucin is a limiting factor concerning processability. The common procedure to reduce this viscosity is the precipitation of ovomucin, which, however, results in undesirable dilution effects and loss of proteins. So, the objective of this work was to develop a method to decrease the viscosity of EW without the described disadvantages. Therefore, a high-pressure homogenization process was used. It was demonstrated that it is possible to destroy the EWs\u2019 fibrillar network by homogenization treatment, and thereby, to decrease the viscosity significantly. Additionally, filtration was enabled, which allows the use of EW for e.g. chromatographic fractionation. Simultaneously, it was shown that lysozyme that was entrapped in the fibrillar network was released, and therefore, it is available for fractionation processes in higher amounts.",

Either the meat processing industry or consumers usually evaluate meat quality with some common quality characteristics, which generally encompass microbiological attributes (freshness, spoilage), chemical attributes (fat, protein, moisture), sensory attributes (color, tenderness, flavor) as well as technological attributes (pH, water-holding capability). Manual inspection and chemical detection methods are tedious, time-consuming, and destructive. Consequently, fast and nondestructive methods are required for detecting these attributes in the modern meat industry. Hyperspectral imaging is one of the promising methods, which integrates the merits of imaging and spectroscopy techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the recent development of hyperspectral imaging systems and their applications in detecting some important quality attributes of pork (color, drip loss, pH, marbling, tenderness, chemical compositions), beef (color, pH, tenderness, water-holding capacity, microbial spoilage), as well as lamb (color, drip loss, pH, tenderness, chemical composition).

Two cultivars, namely Nam Dokmai and Irwin, having different fruit properties and grown in intensively managed orchards in Thailand and Japan, respectively, were used in this study. Postharvest changes in peel colour and fruit quality were observed under three storage conditions with respect to temperature. RF models were applied to establish a relationship between peel colour and fruit quality, and then tested the applicability based on model accuracy and variable importance computed by the RF. Specifically, this work demonstrates how the variable importance can be used to interpret the model results. The high accuracy and the information retrieved by the RF models suggest the applicability and practicality as a non-destructive assessment method for the quality of fresh mango fruit.",

These results were interpreted in terms of lysozyme/LM pectin complexes formation followed by a change in the apparent particle size distribution and the electrophoretic mobility (\u03b6-potential). This complex formation was shown to considerably decrease the lysozyme antimicrobial activity probably due to lysozyme substrate diffusional limitation and/or a decrease of the enzyme mobility. The formed complexes were then used to manufacture an edible antimicrobial film able to control the lysozyme release. The presence of pectinases in the release medium enhanced the lysozyme release confirming that the developed edible antimicrobial film can be used to protect foods against lysozyme sensitive microorganisms and particularly those producing pectinolytic enzymes.",

The intensity of permeabilization induced by PEF was analyzed in terms of the changes of fluorescence intensity of the suspension solution and the average diameter of vesicles, due to the leakage of self-quench calcein encapsulated in vesicles. Results indicated that the permeability of LUV was increased with increasing intensity of electric field (>10\u00a0kV/cm) and treatment time, and the release percentage of calcein (R value) was increased by 57.98% (from 0.46% to 58.44%) with the increase of the electric field strength (from 10 to 50\u00a0kV/cm) at 4.8\u00a0ms.

This spatial variability was examined by measuring fundamental material parameters at different locations in Gouda-type cheese blocks. The verification and quantification of this variability is needed for future research on improving the processing of cheese.Uniaxial compression tests were used to determine Young\u2019s moduli and fracture stresses and strains. Prony series expansions were deduced from stress-relaxation tests. Also the dry matter, protein and fat content and pH of the cheese were determined. Young\u2019s modulus and the residual Prony coefficients were significantly higher near the crust compared to the center. The fracture stress and strain were inversely proportional to young\u2019s modulus and thus lower near the crust. The spatial variability of the fundamental parameters could mainly be explained by the dry matter variability.",

The information generated allows for understanding how critical variables such as quantity of absorbed ClO2 gas and rate of ClO2 gas consumption relate to other performance metrics without requiring post-processing of the produce. Therefore, a new in situ approach to measure the total absorption of ClO2 gas by fresh produce requiring minimal sample preparation was developed using a system equipped with a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer. The system can simulate ClO2 gas treatment at constant and varying concentrations within a package and/or chamber. Strawberries were selected as model fresh produce to assess the system and to evaluate the impact of concentration and time of exposure on total ClO2 gas consumption. It was found that strawberries consume ClO2 gas rapidly and that longer exposure times (17 and 84\u00a0min) for continuous exposure resulted in around 45% ClO2 absorption whereas shorter exposure times (7\u00a0min) consumed less than 20% of the injected ClO2 because the latter did not reach steady state ClO2 consumption prior to completion.",

Firmness and cohesiveness values were used to quantify the extent of staling. Avrami equation was fitted to staling data with R2 coefficients above 0.9 in all cases. Bread characteristics and staling kinetics were significantly affected by fermentation time and fiber, particularly inulin.

Therefore, this study was aimed to test and compare the amounts of bacteria adhered to superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic nanocomposite surfaces under different fluid flow conditions. The superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic layers were separately fabricated by annealing stainless steel plates with carbon nanotubes-polytetrafluoroethylene (CNT\u2013PTFE) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), respectively. The phosphate buffer saline (PBS) suspension of Escherichia coli K-12 at 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0cells/ml was pumped through the chamber at two different flow rates of 0 (stagnant surface) and 200\u00a0ml/min (sheared surface). Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to access the morphologies of the developed nanocomposite surfaces.

A computational model based on the finite element method was also successfully established for predicting the temperature distributions in food by coupling an analysis of the electromagnetic field and heat transfer with a consideration of the rotation of the antenna during heating. Methods for optimizing the simulations to minimize the computational time using a geometric model and the food\u2019s dielectric properties were proposed.

     "abstract": "A prior high pressure processing (HPP) treatment has previously been shown to enhance subsequent (at atmospheric pressure) low temperature \u2018setting\u2019 (glutamyl-lysine, non-disulfide protein crosslinking) induced by transglutaminase (TGase; endogenous or added microbial enzyme). This enhanced setting induces greater gel strength and deformability of subsequently cooked surimi gels. We sought to determine if 25\u00a0\u00b0C incubation carried out simultaneous with, rather than following, HPP might similarly induce a setting effect on subsequently cooked gels. Pollock surimi pastes (\u00b1 added microbial TGase) were subjected to HPP 200, 300, or 400\u00a0MPa; at 5\u00a0\u00b0C (little or no setting effect expected during HPP at this temperature) for 30\u00a0min or at 25\u00a0\u00b0C (optimal setting temperature for pollock pastes) for 30, 60, or 120\u00a0min. Pastes were then directly cooked (90\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min) (pressureP\u00b0C/time\u00a0>\u00a0C), or first allowed to undergo setting at atmospheric pressure (25\u00a0\u00b0C for 30, 60, or 120\u00a0min), followed by cooking (90\u00a0\u00b0C 20\u00a0min) (pressureP\u00b0C/time\u00a0>\u00a0Stime\u00a0>\u00a0C). With no microbial TGase added to the raw paste (e.g., endogenous TGase only), 300MPaP5\u00b0C/30min\u00a0>\u00a0S25\u00b0C/120min\u00a0>\u00a0C induced highest gel fracture stress and strain. The same treatment but with HPP at 200 or 400\u00a0MPa gave only slightly lower fracture stress (gel strength). Increasing the temperature of the HPP treatment to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (300MPaP25\u00b0C/30min\u00a0>\u00a0S25\u00b0C/120min\u00a0>\u00a0C), even with longer HPP time (300MPaP25\u00b0C/60 or 120min\u00a0>\u00a0C), gave weaker gels, similar to those obtained by setting and cooking without a prior HPP treatment (S25\u00b0C/60min\u00a0>\u00a0C). Thus, attempting to induce TGase crosslinking by setting at 25\u00a0\u00b0C during HPP treatment actually seemed detrimental to gel strength development. However, when HPP was carried out at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and microbial TGase was added, gel strength and deformability (fracture stress, strain) were enhanced above that of all other treatments tested. All treatments containing microbial TGase evidenced enhanced protein polymerization. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a more dense and fibrous structure in such gels, and reduction of free thiol (SH) groups was noted as a result of microbial TGase addition.",

Different from other existing methods that rely on complicated machine learning or artificial intelligent algorithms, this method uses 2D histograms of colors in each grading category to determine the co-occurrence frequency. Based on this color analysis result, a mapping matrix is generated for back projecting the input colors of the fruit to their designated color indexes. The date color, which strongly correlates to maturity and quality, can then be graded by analyzing the resulting back projected color indexes. With the proposed method, the operator is allowed to set or adjust the cutoff points of different maturity or quality groups of date for automatic inspection. This paper uses Medjool date grading as an example to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. It is suitable and can be easily adapted for other fruit or vegetable grading applications.

In this work, a 3D vision system based on Structured Light (SL) was used to monitor the fermentation phase. The evolution of the dough was studied employing 10 wheat flours with non-physicochemical and rheological differences. However, differences in dough behaviors during fermentation were found based on SL method parameters. When the variation of the total transversal area was related to the maximum height at each fermentation time a set of peaks and valleys appeared. These sets were directly related to the fermentation capacity. Specifically, a lower number of peaks during the main fermentation time (100\u00a0min) is related to wheat flours with high fermentation capacity. Consequently, the proposed SL Technique could be used as a method to check the fermentation capacity of wheat flours according to their fermentation behavior.",

Rheological measurements showed that the addition of 10\u201320\u00a0mM calcium chloride caused thickening or gelation of milk on heating at 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Thickening was observed with 10\u00a0mM addition, while gelation was evident with \u2a7e12.5\u00a0mM additions, as indicated by an increase in the storage modulus (G\u2032) of the calcium-added milk. The final G\u2032 and breaking stress of milk gels made from \u2a7e12.5\u00a0mM added calcium increased with calcium addition. Pre-heat treatment significantly affected the strength of calcium-induced milk gels. Strong milk gels were obtained by the addition of 20\u00a0mM calcium chloride to pre-heated milk and holding at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min followed by cooling to 20\u00a0\u00b0C.

     "abstract": "Fermented milk is commonly eaten during breakfast or as a snack between meals either in one-portion cups or from a bowl with a spoon. Approximately 5\u201310% of the fermented milk remains in the packages upon pouring, which during the last years, has received attention in public media as newspapers and television. This is a problem, not only from an economical point of view, but also from an ecological and unethical perspective. In this study, we have investigated the influence of rheology, surface characteristics, and storage time; on product adhesion, and this study is a continuation of an earlier study published in this journal.The physical properties of the surface as roughness and morphology were determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Interferometry, contact angle measurements, and Fourier Transform Infrared/Attenuated Total Reflectance Spectroscopy. After incubation, the adhered amount was determined by gravimetrical studies.The results have shown that there are two mechanisms over different time scales that predominate. Initially (seconds\u2013minutes) the excess product is drained of the surfaces until the gravity is opposed by the rheological strength such as the yield stress and the apparent viscosity. The second mechanism occurs on a longer time scale (minutes\u2013hours) and it includes dewatering of the product residue at the surface. Concluded in this work is that the rheological properties of fermented milk is of major importance and that the problem with fermented milk remaining in the packages could be regarded as a flow and dewatering problem rather than an adsorption problem.",

The osmotic properties of the starting aqueous mixtures of WPC and selected hydrocolloids were examined. The results of the research provided insights into the nature of the interactions between water-soluble whey proteins and structure-forming hydrocolloids. The time constants of the rheological exponential equation of the state of shear-thinned liquids (De Kee equation) were determined and the influence of the temperature on the apparent viscosity of the foams was analyzed. Supplementation with structure-forming hydrocolloids such as xanthan gum, gum arabic or carrageenan contributes to the generation of stable foams, with rheological properties typical for viscoelastic solids in the linear range of viscoelasticity. The presence of hydrocolloids stimulates time-dependent nature of foams and manifests in hysteresis of flow curves.",

Two peaks, which were regarded as denaturation of myosin and actin, were observed.

The flow and strength properties of the bulk materials which include the consolidation, shear and unconfined yield stresses were determined at different bulk densities and glycerol concentrations in the range of 1.5\u20133.0\u00a0g/cm3 and 15\u201325\u00a0ml glycerol per 100\u00a0g starch using a uniaxial compression test. The flowability of the bulk solids were classified using Jenike\u2019s flow specifications. The angles of internal and wall frictions of the bulk solids were determined from their yield loci. The hopper half angles were determined from the conical hopper design chart; and the friction factors, which account for the vibration in the arch thickness and the geometric configuration of the composites, were computed empirically. The results show that the compressive strength of the cassava and yam starch\u2013glycerol composites increased significantly with an increase in bulk density and a decrease in the glycerol concentration (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The cohesiveness of the composites increase with increasing glycerol concentration, up to 25\u00a0ml per 100\u00a0g starch, because of their increasing flow function (1\u00a0<\u00a0ff\u00a0<\u00a02). The hopper half angle, friction factor and angles of internal and wall frictions of the cassava starch\u2013glycerol composite at 3.0\u00a0g/cm3 were 18.0\u00b0, 2.48, 43.0\u00b0 and 26.0\u00b0, respectively. The higher angle of wall friction at 3\u00a0g/cm3 implies that a steeper hopper wall is required for a consistent flow of the granular solids through a hopper.",

Color and moisture content are two critical parameters used to evaluate dried soybean quality. This study thus aimed to develop regression models for predicting the color and moisture content of soybeans simultaneously during the drying process using a hyperspectral imaging technique. Hyperspectral reflectance images were acquired from fresh and dried soybeans over the spectral region between 400 and 1000\u00a0nm for 270 samples. After the automatic segmentation of soybean images at each wavelength based on an active contour model, mean reflectance and image entropy parameters were extracted and tested separately and in combination for predicting the color and moisture content of the processed soybeans. Predicting models were built using the partial least squares regression method. Better prediction results for both color and moisture content were achieved using the mean reflectance data (with correlation coefficients or RP\u00a0=\u00a00.862 and root-mean-square errors of prediction or RMSEP\u00a0=\u00a01.04 for color, as well as RP\u00a0=\u00a00.971 and RMSEP\u00a0=\u00a04.7% for moisture content) than when using entropy data (RP\u00a0=\u00a00.839 and RMSEP\u00a0=\u00a01.14 for color, as well as RP\u00a0=\u00a00.901 and RMSEP\u00a0=\u00a09.2% for moisture content). However, the integration of mean reflectance and entropy data did not show significant improvements in predicting the color or moisture content. Overall, a simple hyperspectral imaging technique involving rapid image preprocessing and single spectral features showed significant potential in measuring the color and moisture content of soybeans simultaneously during the drying process.",

Predicted spatial surface temperature profile was in good agreement with the corresponding experimental profiles in terms of hot and cold spot patterns. The root mean square error values ranged from 5.8\u00a0\u00b0C to 26.2\u00a0\u00b0C in chicken nuggets as compared 4.3\u20134.7\u00a0\u00b0C in mashed potatoes. The predicted and experimental temperature profiles were provided as inputs to a microbial inactivation kinetics model for Salmonella Heidelberg to assess food safety risks in chicken nuggets. For 90\u00a0s of cooking in a 1200\u00a0W microwave oven, at least 7-log reductions of Salmonella Heidelberg was not achieved completely at all locations in the chicken nuggets due to non-uniform heating. The validated model can be used to optimize the layout and food system/package modification to achieve more uniform heating.",

     "abstract": "Critical behaviors of peeling tomatoes using infrared radiation heating are thermally induced peel loosening and subsequent cracking. Fundamental understanding of the two critical behaviors, peel loosening and cracking, remains unclear. This study aimed at investigating the mechanisms of peel separation for tomatoes subjected to a newly developed infrared dry-peeling process. Microstructural changes in tomato epidermal tissues under infrared heating were compared with those of fresh, hot lye and steam treated samples. Theoretical stress analyses coupled with the experimentally measured failure stress of tomato skin were combined to interpret the occurrence of peel cracking within a framework of elastic thin shell theory. With the use of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, it was observed that peel loosening due to infrared heating appeared to result from reorganization of extracellular cuticles, thermal expansion of cell walls, and collapse of several cellular layers, differing from samples heated by hot lye and steam. Crack behaviors of tomato skin were attributed to the rapid rate of infrared surface heating which caused the pressure build-up under the skin and strength decrease of the skin. In order to achieve a sufficient skin separation for effective peeling using infrared, promoting rapid and uniform heating on the tomato surface is essential. The findings gained from this study provide new insights for developing the sustainable infrared dry-peeling technology.",

Drying process involves a lot of mechanisms coupled together, and traditional kinetic theory of drying explains part of them, covering up the most important behaviors in the falling drying period. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the critical points of each transformation throughout the drying, and to analyse and quantify all of them. In this sense, an irreversible thermodynamic model has been developed, focusing on the falling drying period. In this work, infrared thermography has been used in order to obtain the evolution of meat surface temperature during drying operation. Infrared measurements were made with an Optris PI\u00ae 160 thermal imager (Optris GmbH, Berlin, Germany), with a spectral infrared range of wavelength from 7.5 to 13\u00a0\u03bcm. Surface water activity, volume, mass and moisture were obtained at different drying times. Drying analysis shows five stages, the traditional induction and the constant kinetic drying period (wet temperature of 22\u00a0\u00b0C) and three more stages in the falling drying period, shared out by the evolution of the surface internal energy and the vitreous transition.",

In the present study the response of the e-tongue to the standard bitter agent caffeine and a range of both casein and whey based hydrolysates was compared to that of a trained sensory panel.Partial least square regression (PLS) was employed to compare the response of the e-tongue and the sensory panel. There was strong correlation shown between the two methods in the analysis of caffeine (R2 of 0.98) and DPH samples with R2 values ranging from 0.94 to 0.99.

The off-line measurements consisted in the acquisition of temporal sequences of thermograms collected at the exit of the oven during the cooling process of biscuits. The processing is focused on the comparative analysis of the thermal emissivity of both foreign bodies and of biscuits decay curves. Benchmark defects were inserted in the on-line products.

Discharge coefficient profiles are reported for a range of flow rates and show very good agreement with computational fluid dynamics simulations, indicating that the shear stress imposed on the surface can be estimated with confidence. The use of ZFDG to study the thickness and removal of soft layers was demonstrated with layers of a commercial petroleum jelly (Vaseline\u00ae) layer. The Vaseline\u00ae layers exhibited cohesive breakdown on 316 stainless steel, indium tin oxide coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and glass under suction mode testing. The cohesive strength agreed with the yield stress measured in separate rheological tests. When exposed to ejecting liquid on glass, however, the layers switched from cohesive breakdown to an adhesive rupture mechanism which is attributed to an instability in the layer and the observed tendency to slip on smooth substrates.",

Reducing salt and sugar levels increased torque, die pressure and specific mechanical energy. The increased die pressure resulted in higher expansion of the extrudate with more porous structure. This was particularly evident when both salt and sugar were eliminated in the formulation. Reducing salt and sugar did not appear to influence the shear viscosity of the melt except when eliminated from the formulation. Similarly the maximum force to fracture the extrudates was also not significantly affected, except when salt and sugar were removed completely. Salt and sugar has synergistic effect on processing energy, extrudate expansion and mechanical strength. This provided a potential to decrease the sugar and salt in extruded products but still maintain textural quality.",

Three commercial pea protein isolates were compared in order to investigate which protein properties affect extruder responses and product texture properties. The comparison revealed that although their basic chemical compositions were similar their functional properties affected the viscosity of the protein mass during the initial heating phase of the extrusion process. The product texture properties depended on the cooking temperature and were basically similar among the proteins, although considerably different energy input was observed during texturization. Our findings show that pea protein isolates are valuable raw materials for the development of fibrous whole-muscle meat alternatives, opening up a wide range of products for different consumer requirements.",

The model was considered based on red, white, and green tissues and included individual properties such as density and elasticity modulus. Modal analysis of the finite element model showed acceptable agreement between experimental results and finite element simulation. According to the mode shapes of watermelon, optimum locations for applying input vibrations and detecting output vibrations were suggested. Then watermelons were excited and their responses were recorded by LDV at the determined locations. The phase shift between input and output signals were extracted over a wide frequency range. The firmness of cut fruits was measured with penetrometer as a ripeness indicator. A regression model was developed to predict the internal texture firmness using phase shifts at statistically selected frequencies.

The application of high-intensity ultrasound could constitute a way of improving traditional convective drying systems. Therefore, the main aim of this work was to assess the influence of high-intensity ultrasound on transfer phenomena during the convective drying in a high-void bed of non-porous materials, like thyme leaves. For this purpose, drying kinetics of thyme leaves were carried out at 1, 2 and 3\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 air velocity at different air temperatures (40, 50, 60, 70, and 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0\u00b0C), and different levels of acoustic power density (0, 6.2, 12.3, 18.5\u00a0kW\u00a0m\u22123). To address the effect of US on the drying kinetics, a mathematical model was developed considering time varying boundary conditions for heat and mass transfer between the air and the product. Due to the physical characteristic of the material, the influence of the ultrasound power density applied on the internal resistance to the mass transfer was significantly lower than its influence of the external resistance; therefore process intensification is mainly linked to external resistance. Nevertheless, the influence of the application of ultrasound on transport phenomena was only observed at air temperatures and air velocities below 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 3\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 respectively.",

In this paper standard solutions to the contact mechanics problem of a spherical elastic particle with an adhesive surface impacting a rigid plate at normal and oblique angles form the basis of a derivation of a semi-empirical criterion that describes whether a particle sticks after impacting a wall. To validate the criterion, the determining factors of skim milk powder deposition, which are air temperature, water activity (i.e. relative humidity), plate (or wall) temperature, and particle size, velocity and impact angle, are isolated and experimentally tested using the Particle Gun technique.",

The obtained membranes were characterized on basis of molecular weight cut off (MWCO), hydraulic permeability, hydrophilicity, pore density, porosity, surface morphology and mechanical strength. It was found that a set of membranes of various MWCO was obtained ranging from 7\u00a0kDa to 104\u00a0kDa for various compositions of the blend.

It is therefore worthwhile to search for an appropriate means to extract these carotenoids from, and hence increase the value of, the residues. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) has noted to be a promising alternative for such a purpose; however, extraction yields achievable through MAE are in many cases lower than those achievable through conventional solvent extraction. Extending the MAE time further would nevertheless result in thermal degradation of carotenoids. In this study, the use of intermittent microwave radiation at various values of the intermittency ratio, which refers to the fraction of the microwave radiation time to the total processing time in one cycle (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a01/2, 1/3 and 1/4), to allow extended MAE without causing excessive thermal degradation of \u03b2-carotene and carotenoids from carrot peels was investigated; the antioxidant activity of the extracts was also assessed.

In this paper, we report on the development of a nondestructive detection algorithm for visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy that can be used to detect internal defects in Japanese radishes. Using the first derivative, selected Vis/NIR wavelengths were calculated by a stepwise forward selection method and then used as classifying parameters in a LDA, PLS-DA, and a neural network. The LDA and neural network were then used to build the detection algorithm based on leave-one-out cross validation. The PLS-DA was then used to build the detection algorithm based on double loop leave-one-out cross validation. When the LDA and PLS-DA were used for the prediction set (removed samples), both of the overall discriminant rate were 90.1%. When the error goal was 0.05 and the number of hidden neurons was 13, the discriminant rates for normal radishes, radishes with internal defects, and the total for all samples were 97.0%, 82.9% and 92.4%, respectively.

     "abstract": "Effects of ultrasound and/or heating on the yield of pectin, swelling behavior of material, and kinetics of pectin extraction from grapefruit peel were investigated. Several extraction parameters significantly affected the yield of pectin and swelling index (SI) of vegetal tissue. The optimal extraction conditions for ultrasound-assisted heating extraction (UAHE) selected through single-factor experiments were as follows: ultrasound power density 0.40\u00a0W/mL, duty cycle 50%, temperature 60\u00a0\u00b0C, solid\u2013liquid ratio 1/50\u00a0g/mL. Image studies showed that UAHE disrupted the vegetal tissue and significantly improved its swelling behavior. There existed significantly high correlations between tissue SI and pectin yield, indicating that the improvement of pectin extractability via disrupting vegetal tissue was the main mechanism for ultrasonic enhancement of extraction. A theoretical model, which could simultaneously describe the extractability, dissolution and degradation rates of pectin, and predict the maximal yield and the optimal time, was used to study the extraction kinetics when ultrasound and/or heating were applied. Yields of pectin extracted using UAHE (0.40\u00a0W/mL and 60\u00a0\u00b0C), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE, 0.40\u00a0W/mL and 30\u00a0\u00b0C), heating extraction (HE, 60\u00a0\u00b0C), room temperature extraction (RE, 30\u00a0\u00b0C) and conventional heating extraction (CHE, 80\u00a0\u00b0C) within 60\u00a0min were monitored and analyzed by the model respectively. The kinetics study showed that both heating and ultrasound could significantly facilitate the extractability, dissolution and degradation of pectin, and there existed a synergistic effect between them. Compared with CHE, UAHE significantly improved the extractability and extraction rate of pectin, leading to higher yield (26.74%) with shorter extraction time (51.79\u00a0min) and reduced temperature (60\u00a0\u00b0C).

     "abstract": "Rapid and nondestructive methods for predicting meat quality and safety attributes are of great concerns at present. A Hyperspectral imaging technique was investigated for evaluating pork meat tenderness and Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination in this study. Totally 31 samples were used for hyperspectral imaging in the spectral range of 400\u20131100\u00a0nm. A novel method by Modified Gompertz function was exploited to extract the scattering characteristics of pork meat from the spatially-resolved hyperspectral images. Gompertz parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b5 and \u03b4 which can represent different optical meanings were derived by curve-fitting to the original scattering profiles. The fitting coefficients were all around 0.99 between 470 and 960\u00a0nm, which indicating the effective interpretation by Gompertz function. Multi-linear regression models were established using both individual parameters and integrated parameters, and the results showed that Gompertz parameter \u03b4 was superior to other individual parameters for both pork meat tenderness and E. coli contamination, and the integrated parameter can perform better than individual parameters. The validation results (RCV) by the integrated parameter method were 0.949 and 0.939 for pork meat tenderness and E. coli contamination respectively. The study demonstrated that hyperspectral imaging technique combined with Gompertz function was potential for rapid determination of pork meat tenderness and E. coli contamination, and so hopefully to provide a promising tool for monitoring the multiple attributes concerning meat quality and safety.",

Formulations consisting of lactose or a 70:30 mixture of lactose: sucrose (23.9%), sodium caseinate (5.1%) and sunflower oil (11.5%) in water were heat treated (100\u00a0\u00b0C, 30\u00a0s), homogenized (17\u00a0MPa) or microfluidized (100\u00a0MPa) and spray dried at two different outlet temperatures (80 or 90\u00a0\u00b0C). Nanoemulsions produced by microfluidization were more stable and less viscous than control emulsions and had lower solvent extractable free fat. Increasing dryer outlet temperature reduced water content, water activity, particle size, tapped bulk density, with a consequent increase of onset temperature of glass transition (Tg) and crystallization (Tcr) of lactose in powders. Reduction of fat globule size by microfluidization lowered Tcr of lactose, an effect attributed to the lower level of protein in the continuous phase. Partial replacement of lactose with sucrose decreased Tg and delayed crystallisation. The study demonstrated that the physical properties of powders can be altered by reducing the fat globule size of emulsions pre spray drying.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ultrasound on the dissolution properties of milk protein concentrate (MPC) powders. A high intensity ultrasound (20\u00a0kHz; power 70.2\u00a0W) was used to dissolve MPC powder and the dissolution rate was compared to conventional methods of dispersion (e.g., stirring). Rehydration of MPC by stirring at 50\u00a0\u00b0C complied with the 2-step dissolution model whereby the disappearance of larger particles coincided with the formation of smaller ones over time. MPC dispersal by sonication dramatically accelerated this process, achieving >90% levels of powder solubilisation. Temperature rise (>70\u00a0\u00b0C) during sonication causes protein denaturation and aggregation, but this can be alleviated using thermal dissipation. Overall, the use of a combination rehydration process for MPC powders involving (i) conventional dissolution (stirring) for 10\u00a0min at 50\u00a0\u00b0C followed by (ii) ultrasonication (<50\u00a0\u00b0C) for 1\u00a0min (energy density 21.1\u00a0J/mL) can achieve rapid powder dissolution.",

     "abstract": "Tenderness is a critical quality characteristic of salmon fillets and Warner\u2013Bratzler shear force (WBSF) is a widely used objective indicator for tenderness evaluation of salmon fillets. This research studied rapid and non-destructive prediction of tenderness in fresh farmed salmon fillets using visible and near-infrared (Vis\u2013NIR) hyperspectral imaging. Hyperspectral images of tested fillets with different tenderness levels were acquired and their spectral features were extracted in 400\u20131720\u00a0nm. Two calibration algorithms, namely partial least squares regression (PLSR) and least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) analysis, were used to correlate the extracted spectra of salmon samples with the reference tenderness values estimated by WBSF method. Optimal wavelength selection was carried out based on full range spectra with two methods, regression coefficients (RC) from PLSR analysis and successful projections algorithm (SPA). The best set of optimum wavelengths was determined as the one containing four wavelengths (555, 605, 705 and 930\u00a0nm) selected by SPA. These four optimum wavelengths were then used to build an optimised SPA-LS-SVM prediction model, reaching the best result with a correlation coefficient (rP) of 0.905 and root mean square error estimated by prediction (RMSEP) of 1.089. At last, an image processing algorithm was developed to transfer the SPA-LS-SVM model to each pixel in salmon fillets for visualising their WBSF distribution. The overall results of this study reveal the capability of hyperspectral imaging as a fast and non-invasive technique to quantitatively predict tenderness of salmon fillets with a good performance.",

LAOS is shown to be much more sensitive than small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) to the influence of NaCl concentration. This is illustrated by a complete rheological characterisation of the system by means of both full-cycle (average elastic modulus and dynamic viscosity) and local methods (strain-hardening and shear-thickening ratios). The different rheological behaviours observed were related to the microstructures of the xanthan gum molecules as a function of the NaCl content.",

The effects were studied using a shear cell device and an extruder with emphasis on the added moisture content. Six diets were formulated: an SPC-based diet with 300\u00a0g SPC kg\u22121, diets containing 100 and 200\u00a0g LPC kg\u22121 or 100 and 200\u00a0g RPC kg\u22121 and an FM-based diet with 450\u00a0g FM kg\u22121. Each diet was extruded with an added moisture content of 29%, 25% and 22% of the mash feed rate. It was found that the technological properties of LPC closely resemble FM, being high solubility, low water-holding capacity (WHC) and low paste viscosity. The LPC 100 and 200\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121 diets could be extruded at 22% moisture, which gives an extrudate with reduced drying requirements. In addition, less specific mechanical energy was needed for extrusion. In contrast, both SPC and RPC have high WHC and paste viscosity. This explains the higher feed moisture required during extrusion. The properties of the feeds containing RPC could be well within the ranges acceptable for commercial fish feed use at even higher moisture content compared with SPC. The results of the extrusion trials confirmed the observations made from the shear cell device. Thus, the shear cell device can be used to study processing conditions that are close to extrusion conditions.",

Also, chemical interesterification (the exchange of fatty acids within and between triacylglycerols) has been used to enhance the melting profile of vegetable oils blends used in food industry. The present work uses a computational approach using Solid\u2013Liquid Equilibrium (SLE) to predict SFC and simulate the chemical interesterification reaction (CI) for different formulations using palm oil (PO), sunflower oil (SFO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). More than 3696 SLE problems are solved, allowing the evaluation of how the fraction of each oil, the temperature and the CI reaction impacts the SFC. The calculated SFC values are compared with experimental data taken from literature. For systems composed of two or one single vegetable oil, the average absolute error (AAE) is 5.2% before CI and 4.2% after CI. For systems composed of three vegetable oils, the AAE is 6.3% before CI and 4.2% after CI. The predictions of SFC before and after CI reaction can aid the food makers to face the combinatorial problem imposed by the choice of the vegetable oil and its fraction in the blend. Future improvements in the pure component properties, thermodynamic model and distribution model of fatty acids in the triacylglycerols can increase the use of computational approaches allowing the experiments to be focused on the most promising formulations in terms of melting profile.",

     "abstract": "In this study, a method to estimate water diffusivity in axial, radial and angular directions during drying of anisotropic cylindrical solids is proposed. The method is based on the analytical solution for non-steady state mass transfer equation in products shaped as longitudinal sections of finite anisotropic cylinders. A sequential approach is applied where radial and axial diffusion coefficients are first estimated from drying curves of whole cylinders with increasing height, while angular diffusivity is obtained thereafter from drying experiments carried out with longitudinal sections of fixed-height cylinders varying cut angle. Developed theory was applied to the analysis of two sets of convective drying data of carrot obtained at 80\u00a0\u00b0C with an air velocity of 2\u00a0m/s. The first experiment set was conducted with carrot cylinders of 2.2\u00a0cm diameter and heights of 1, 2,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a010\u00a0cm, while cylinders in the second set were longitudinally cut as halves, quarters, sixths and eighths with a constant height of 10\u00a0cm.

Differences in water diffusivity for studied mass transfer directions were significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), with SEM images revealing structural differences between longitudinal and transversal product cuts, thus further supporting numerical results. Present findings suggest that, depending on product, anisotropic diffusion should be included in drying modeling in order to obtain an accurate process description.",

The lower level of oil oxidation was observed for the agglomerate preparations, especially the agglomerate obtained with the use of the trehalose solution as a wetting liquid. The impact of agglomeration was reflected in a significant decrease of the level of adsorbed water, being sufficient to initiate the transition of amorphous trehalose to the crystalline state.",

However, the dynamic properties of water play an important role in complementing the information provided by water sorption isotherms. One of the most successful techniques used to prove the dynamic behavior of water in foods systems is pulsed NMR. The aim of this study was to apply the concept of proton mobility in order to better define the water-related dynamic aspects of freeze-dried fruits. Different water mobility populations were defined through 1H NMR transversal relaxation times, obtained after the application of several pulses sequences. The water content limits at which proton populations with different mobility appeared, allowed a more complete and precise description of water behavior at the different sorption stages than the parameters obtained by the application of sorption mathematical models.",

A total of 8491 apples for the three varieties harvested from the same orchard in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were used for analysis. First derivative spectra were obtained from the Vis/SWNIR data, while the scattering images were first preprocessed by computing mean reflectance spectra and then performing continuous wavelet transform decompositions. Sorting algorithms were developed using sequential forward selection and linear discriminant analysis, and the classification models were compared in terms of their overall performance and local confusion matrices. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the effect of using different quality threshold criteria on the sorting performance. Overall, consistent and relatively good sorting results for firmness (ranging between 77.9% and 98.2%) and moderate results for SSC (ranging between 62.0% and 91.7%) were obtained using scattering technique. Vis/SWNIR technique showed slightly better sorting results for firmness (ranging between 87.3% and 97.6%) and SSC (ranging between 77.1% and 92.3%).

This study evaluated the application of a chemical marker M2 (4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone) in an egg white gel model on the determination of possible heating patterns in prepackaged foods during MAP processing. The gel model samples were prepared by heating a homogeneous liquid egg white mixture (25% egg white, 1% D-ribose, 0.5% L-lysine) at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The chemical marker M2 formation was studied by heating the gel model samples in 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100\u00a0\u00b0C oil bath for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30\u00a0min. The marker yields were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The color values of the heat-treated samples were measured using CIE L\u2217a\u2217b\u2217 and RGB models. The stability of M2 was evaluated at storage temperatures of 4 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C for 1, 3, 5, and 9\u00a0days. In order to validate the application of the new gel model system, the heating patterns of the gel models and marker yields of samples taken from 5 different locations of the MAP-processed gel models at 75 and 100\u00a0\u00b0C were analyzed. Results showed that the M2 formation in egg white increased linearly with heat treatment time at 75\u201395\u00a0\u00b0C, while a slight concavity was observed for samples treated at 100\u00a0\u00b0C. Color parameters L\u2217 and G values were found to be significantly correlated with the heating temperatures. During storage, the M2 retention rate decreased with increasing time and temperature, while samples treated for longer times were more stable. Salt addition had no significant effect on the M2 yield within the studied time-temperature combination. The color change of egg white gel models due to different M2 yield after the MAP process could be clearly recognized using a computer vision method.",

As the starch proportion increased, composite films became more fragile to break, whereas a positive effect on the elasticity of films was realized by a considerable increase in E% values. The composite films presented lower water vapor permeability than films without starch. The temperature for preparation of film-forming solution also had adverse effect on film properties.

The effects of screw speed (180\u2013720\u00a01/min), moisture content (18\u201328%, wet base) and barrel temperature (100\u2013160\u00a0\u00b0C) on the retention of anthocyanins, total phenolics and antioxidant activity in extruded samples were investigated. While total phenolics and antioxidant activity were unaffected by extrusion cooking, anthocyanin retention was depending on barrel temperature, moisture content, screw speed and flow rate. The highest retention was observed at the lowest barrel temperature (100\u00a0\u00b0C, c/c0\u00a0=\u00a00.82), the highest moisture content (28%, c/c0\u00a0=\u00a00.90), the lowest screw speed (180 1/min, c/c0\u00a0=\u00a00.75) and the highest flow rate (30\u00a0kg/h at 360\u00a01/min, c/c0\u00a0=\u00a00.77), respectively. Even at the highest screw speed of 720\u00a01/min investigated, the anthocyanin retention could be enhanced by increasing the flow rate. The addition of a flow channel extended the exposure time and decreased anthocyanin retention. A comparison between offline heating of bilberry extract solutions and extrusion cooking indicated that the rate constant of anthocyanin degradation depends on moisture content and interactions with mechanical energy. Extruded samples showed a high retention of color and anthocyanins up to 82% even after 40\u00a0months of storage. Extrusion cooking offers thus the chance to produce products rich in total phenolics and antioxidants while anthocyanins retention can be adjusted.",

     "abstract": "A parameter estimation approach was applied to characterise the heat transfer of Scraped Surface Heat Exchangers (SSHEs) specifically designed for the food industry. It is difficult to apply the data available in the literature to SSHEs, due to the specificity of each product, thermal treatment and geometrical configuration, making the thermal design of these apparatuses critical. Therefore, it appears to be more useful to assess the methodology used to derive a proper heat transfer correlation than to assess the form of the heat transfer correlation itself, as the correlation often cannot be transferred to other heat exchangers, even those that belong to the same class.This study enabled successful and robust estimation of the heat transfer correlation for the product side Nusselt number and the external side heat transfer coefficient; this approach differs from Wilson plot methods, as no assumption is made regarding the functional dependence of the external side heat transfer coefficient.The procedure was validated through application to both synthetic data and experimental data acquired from a coaxial SSHE pilot plant for the treatment of highly viscous fluid foods.The procedure was optimised with the aid of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, which provided considerable insight into the problem.The application to synthetic data demonstrated that under typical operating conditions, areas of insensitivity to certain parameters are present. The application to the experimental data acquired under both heating and cooling conditions confirmed that the measured values of the overall heat transfer coefficient can be used to estimate the secondary fluid heat transfer coefficient, as well as the power law dependence of the internal fluid Nusselt number on the rotational Reynolds number and the Prandtl number together with the multiplicative constant. The uncertainty analysis provided the confidence intervals associated with each estimated parameter, thereby enabling the quality and robustness of the resulting heat transfer correlations to be determined.",

A randomized factorial design with three factors and three replicates was employed. Cow, goat and sheep milk was mixed in two different proportions. Milk mixtures were coagulated at constant calcium chloride addition level, pH and fat concentrations using two different enzyme concentrations and three coagulation temperatures (N\u00a0=\u00a036 tests). Milk coagulation was monitored using small amplitude oscillatory rheometry and a NIR fiber optic light backscatter sensor. Simultaneously, clotting time was visually evaluated. Optical parameter tmax was highly correlated (0.80\u00a0<\u00a0r\u00a0<\u00a00.99, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with the rheological and visual parameters studied.

Milk mixture proportion was not significant for optical parameters related to clotting time but was significant for the aggregation rate and rheological parameters related to curd firming and syneresis. Models for predicting cutting time were developed successfully with R2\u00a0=\u00a00.93. Results strongly suggest that milk mixture proportion exerts an effect on gel assembly (i.e., on both aggregation and curd firming) and syneresis.

     "abstract": "Controlling the rheological properties of dispersion has been of great interest in the food processing industry. Effects of particle size and temperature on oscillatory rheology of pumpkin flour dispersion were studied. Fresh pumpkin was freeze-dried, grinded and sieved through selected screens to obtain desired particle size fractions (74\u2013841\u00a0\u03bcm). Most of the particles are spherical in shape. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and the melting temperature (Tm) of starch\u2013lipid complex varied with particle size which is believed to be due to compositional variations. Rheological measurement of reconstituted particles as a function of temperature (10\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C) and concentration (4\u201310% w/w) indicated a solid-like behavior (G\u2032\u00a0>\u00a0G\u2033). Sediment volume fraction (\u03d5) of isolated particle dispersions indicated a gradual decrease with decrease in particle size, which directly influences the mechanical strength and visco-elasticity of the dispersion. Particle size influenced the mechanical rigidity of pumpkin dispersion markedly whereas the temperature had the least effect. An unexpected increase in G\u2032 of finest particle containing dispersion with temperature could be associated with gelatinization of starch and flocculation of particles with broken cell walls. Microscopic observation revealed the presence of a continuous network for the finest particle dispersion, as opposed to discontinuous one for other particle sizes.",

It was observed that the partial replacement of starch by pectin and inulin with varying degrees of polymerization (average DP: <10, \u2a7e10, and \u2a7e23) significantly modified thermal and rheological properties of starch gels. In most cases, the increase in pectin concentration resulted in a drop of consistency coefficient and both moduli. Inulin exerted different effects, depending on its average DP and concentration, which could be explained by the presence or formation of low molecular weight sugars. A slight increase of moduli was observed for a DP\u00a0<\u00a010, a drop for a DP\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a010, and for a DP\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a023 the values of G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 initially increased (at low concentration) and then diminished. Statistical analyses proved the significance interactions between inulin and pectin molecules on properties of starch pastes and gels, and their character was controlled by average DP of applied inulin preparation. Addition of inulin and pectin significantly reduced starch transition enthalpy after retrogradation, and consistency indices. The gels prepared with inulins of medium and high DP were characterized by low storage and loss moduli in comparison to standard, while the addition of low DP inulin caused a slight increase in their value.",

     "abstract": "Water loss of fruit typically results in fruit tissue deformation and consequent quality loss. To better understand the mechanism of water loss, a model of water transport between cells and intercellular spaces coupled with cell deformation was developed. Pear (Pyrus communis L. cv. Conference) was chosen as a model system as this fruit suffers from shriveling with excessive water loss. A 2D geometric model of cortex tissue was obtained by a virtual fruit tissue generator that is based on cell growth modeling. The transport of water in the intercellular space, the cell wall network and cytoplasm was predicted using transport laws using the chemical potential as the driving force for water exchange between different microstructural compartments. The different water transport properties of the microstructural components were obtained experimentally or from literature. An equivalent microscale model that incorporates the dynamics of mechanical deformation of the cellular structure was implemented. The model predicted the apparent tissue conductivity of pear cortex tissue to be 9.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221215\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22121\u00a0s\u22121\u00a0Pa\u22121, in the same range as those measured experimentally. The largest gradients in water content were observed across the cell walls and cell membranes. A sensitivity analysis of membrane permeability and elastic modulus of the wall on the water transport properties and deformation showed that the membrane permeability has the largest influence. The model can be improved further by taking into account 3-D connectivity of cells and intercellular pore spaces. It will then become feasible to evaluate measures to reduce water loss of fruit during storage and distribution using the microscale model in a multiscale modeling framework.",

Hyperspectral imaging techniques that combine the advantages of spectroscopy and imaging have been widely applied for a variety of food quality and safety evaluations. In this study, near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging technique was investigated to detect low levels ( \u2a7d 1.0%) of melamine particles in milk powders. Following image preprocessing (normalization and background removal), the spectrum of each pixel in the sample images was compared to the pure melamine spectrum by spectral similarity measures including spectral angle measure (SAM), spectral correlation measure (SCM), and Euclidian distance measure (EDM). The three similarity analysis methods provided comparable results for melamine particle detection where imaging allowed visualization of the distribution of melamine particles within images of milk powder mixture samples that were prepared with various melamine concentrations. The classification results were verified by spectral feature comparison between separated mean spectra of melamine pixels and milk powder pixels. The study demonstrated that a combination of NIR hyperspectral imaging technique and spectral similarity analyses was an effective method for melamine adulteration discrimination in milk powders. The method described in this study can also be applied to other chemicals or multi-chemicals adulterant detection in milk powders.",

For comparison, traditional linear discriminant analyses of 108,351 reflectance profiles from individual pixels in the 72 samples or average reflectance profiles from the 72 samples classified the validation data with 84.0% and 83.3% accuracy, respectively. We are unaware of any reflectance-based classification system, which \u2013 based on reflectance data acquired in only three channels (spectral bands) \u2013 can provide this level of sensitivity and specificity and classification of independent validation data of internal defects in food products. Accurate and reliable classification of food objects based reflectance values in only a few spectral bands would likely imply low computer processing requirements and rapid data analysis. Thus, we believe that the current classification method may be useful for quality control systems of a wide range of food products.",

The impact of drying methods on protein, microstructure and physicochemical qualities of dried fillets were evaluated. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed that water penetrated from periphery to central region during rehydration. Nuclear magnetic signal intensity after 60\u00a0min rehydration was high at the periphery and low in the center for FD samples, but was identical at the surface of AD and HPD samples. AD induced the severest compact structure and myosin degradation while FD resulted in the porous structure in dried fillets. The new band at 37\u00a0kD protein for AD samples was more intense than that for HPD and FD samples. FD resulted in the greatest rehydration ability but the softest texture, followed by HPD and AD. There was a good coordination among moisture distribution, rehydration ability, and hardness with the microstructure and protein damage of dried fillets.",

The effects of food shrinkage on drying performance were ascertained by analyzing the spatial distributions of temperature, moisture content, strain and stress, as a function of operating conditions. The agreement between model predictions and a set of experimental data collected during drying of cylindrical potatoes was good as far as the time evolutions of food average moisture content and of its main dimensions, i.e. length and diameter, were concerned.",

     "abstract": "In the field of agricultural sciences, numerical modelling has proven to be a valuable tool in finding solutions to practical and scientific issues. In the present study a computational model of plant tissue that incorporates micro-scale geometrical features was developed to provide qualitative and quantitative predictions of the mechanical properties of onion (Allium cepa) epidermis. The simulations of cellular structure behaviour under various mechanical load conditions were carried out using the finite element method (FEM). The models were validated against experimental data from a tensile test of the real tissue strips. The models showed capabilities of simulating large strains (up to 25%) with nonlinear behaviour and produced force-strain curves that closely matched the experimental data. Also, a new insight into the relationship between microstructure and mechanical behaviour was provided for this type of material. The incorporation of the real microstructure resulted in a qualitative improvement of the mechanical characteristics obtained from FEM models of plant tissues. The ability to directly simulate the impact of changes in turgor pressure was limited due to the semi-three dimensional representation of tissue. The general behaviour of tissue resulting from the changes in turgor was approximated using the semi-solid protoplast that replaced the cells liquid. On the basis of a sensitivity analysis it was concluded that the validity of the results provided by the model is largely dependent on accurate measurements of cell wall thickness.",

Freestanding bread loaves had a higher loaf volume, a lower structure thickness and a higher porosity than pan baked bread. Remarkably, variations between batches of each type of bread were found to be rather small when judging them by these parameters. In addition, localized morphological analysis was applied to generate spatial maps of the porosity, the structure thickness and the number of closed pores on the cross sections of bread. This provided insight into the heterogeneity of bread, revealing localized microstructural features/defects, molding lines, crust artifacts and effects of baking kinetics.

An ability to modify the microstructure of a food material is therefore highly desirable as this would allow a food processor to either produce a product with the desired characteristics or prepare a product in a way that facilitates further processing. Microstructural modification can be achieved in a number of ways, including the use of appropriate drying techniques and conditions, with or without sample pretreatment. In this review, the use of selected pretreatment methods and drying technologies to create various microstructures is explored and discussed. Selected examples of microstructural modification by creating a more porous structure to produce highly-crisp fat-free snacks as well as a structure that facilitates the release of a compound from the food matrix and hence increased bioaccessibility and/or extractability of the compound are presented. Use of image analysis techniques to monitor the microstructural changes and a structure-quality indicator, which can relate the changes at the microscopic level to those at the macroscopic level, are also briefly reviewed.",

     "abstract": "Knowledge about moisture diffusivity in solid matrices is a key for understanding drying behaviour of for example probiotic or enzymatic formulations. This paper presents an experimental procedure to determine moisture diffusivity on the basis of thin film drying and gravimetric analysis in a Dynamic Vapour Sorption (DVS) system. The extraction of moisture diffusivity is based on the \u201cregular regime approach\u201d. The method was explored and verified for its assumptions. It provided insight in the effect of moisture content and temperature on moisture diffusivity. Moreover, it was found that moisture diffusivity in different carbohydrate systems was similar and decreased with moisture content. The latter was explained by similar molecular interactions in carbohydrate systems and formation of a percolating network at low moisture content that affects water mobility. Subsequently, measured moisture diffusivities were compared to model predictions based on the generalised Darken relation. It was found that predicted moisture diffusivities were in fair agreement with these, including the effect of moisture content and temperature on moisture diffusivity. At low moisture content the model overestimated the sensitivity of moisture diffusivity towards temperature. This was explained by the fact that the different water\u2013solid interactions at lower moisture content (including relaxation behaviour in the glassy state) are not considered in the modelling. Finally, the methodology was successfully evaluated to other solid matrices such as glycerol, skimmed milk and casein, providing different moisture diffusivities as function of moisture content.",

Sulforaphane is of interest as it is claimed to possess chemoprotective effect against an array of cancers. The formation of sulforaphane is via enzymatic reactions and the rates of formation and degradation are strongly dependent on the temperature. Careful regulation of the material temperature during drying to maximize the formation and minimize the degradation of sulforaphane should therefore be possible. In this study, the effect of stepwise change of medium temperature during hot air drying, vacuum drying and hybrid drying, i.e., low-pressure superheated steam drying (LPSSD) followed by vacuum drying, on the evolution of sulforaphane in white cabbage outer leaves was investigated; the results were compared with those in the cases of constant drying medium temperature. Similar evolution patterns of sulforaphane were noted in all cases; sulforaphane first increased before reaching the maximum and then decreased towards the end of drying. Nevertheless, the cabbages undergone LPSSD at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min and then vacuum drying at 45\u00a0\u00b0C until reaching the final moisture content exhibited the highest amount of sulforaphane.",

The diffusion of water into the starch granule will be affected by the type of solvent used, the temperature, and the size and shape of the starch granule. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to assess the effect of steeping corn grits at room temperature in a solution with and without the addition of calcium hydroxide on the hydration and pasting properties. We evaluated the moisture gain, pH change, viscosity profile, and the microstructure of the endosperm relative to the steeping time of corn grits with and without calcium hydroxide. Corn grits steeped in water without calcium hydroxide showed lower water absorption (35\u00a0g/100\u00a0g) than those steeped with 1\u00a0g Ca(OH)2/100\u00a0g (38\u00a0g/100\u00a0g) and 2\u00a0g Ca(OH)2/100\u00a0g (40\u00a0g/100\u00a0g). Electron micrographs show that the starch granule size in corn grits increases due to water absorption. Viscosity increases with steeping time and the calcium hydroxide concentration shows a correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.7) with water absorption. We calculated effective diffusion coefficient of corn grits with and without calcium hydroxide concentration, solving Fick\u2019s equation for a sphere. Water diffusion into the starch granule is an important step that significantly influences the pasting properties of the corn grits.",

Breads with varying texture were prepared under various dough mixing conditions and formats, different baking times (8, 11, 15 and 17\u00a0min), and with various contents of bioprocessed fibres. They were crushed, by the multi-indenter at a constant rate (50\u00a0mm/min), followed by a relaxation step while maintaining stable the final strain at 2/3rd of the initial sample height. Main variables measured from the resulting texture profile were related to crust stiffness and crumb firmness.

This study investigated the impact of pH (5.6\u20137.0) on viscoelastic properties of tuna myofibrillar proteins using dynamic oscillatory rheometer under both small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS). Using small-strain oscillatory tests, the rheological properties during gelling were quantified. Results indicated that protein denaturation and gel formation were pH dependent. LAOS tests indicated that pH strongly affected the structure of the myofibrillar proteins system as shown by deformation of the nonlinear stress response curve. Increasing pH produced an increasingly strong, more stable network.

Furthermore, pH also appeared to influence the water-holding capacity and surface hydrophobicity.",

Moreover, the influence of some pretreatments (centrifugation, enzymatic liquefaction and chitosan coagulation) before passion fruit juice microfiltration was analyzed. Enzymatic treatment reduced the juice viscosity, and centrifugation step was important for colour and turbidity reductions. Chitosan addition was the most promising pretreatment, since it provides the highest reductions of colour and turbidity, enabling the highest permeate flux in the microfiltration process of pretreated passion fruit juice. The microfiltration process with hollow fibre membranes resulted in a clean passion fruit juice, almost free of turbidity. The applied pretreatment did not influence the characteristics of the obtained permeate. According to the obtained results, the predominant fouling mechanism depends on the applied pretreatment. In centrifuged and enzymatic treated samples, cake formation was found to be the major fouling factor, while internal pore blocking occurred during the filtration of the chitosan pretreated sample.",

All films exhibited good performance in terms of optical properties in the CIELab space showing high transparency. Carvacrol was able to reduce CC oxygen permeability and slightly increased the surface hydrophobicity. Dye diffusion experiments were performed to evaluate permeation properties.

The new package designs both showed an improved cooling rate and cooling uniformity, although this improvement is to some extent dependent on the cooling system that is used, which should also be taken into account when evaluating package design. The energy required to maintain airflow through the containers during the precooling process was also less for the new containers due to their lower aerodynamic resistance. These new containers seem a cost-effective way for improving forced-convective precooling of orange fruit with respect to throughput, fruit quality and operational cost of the system.

Following the blanching, the samples were deep-fat par-fried at 174\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min and were then deep-fat finish-fried at 146, 160, and 174\u00a0\u00b0C for 2, 3, 4 and 5\u00a0min.

In this technique, the mixtures are levitated at a specific position in a superconducting magnet, and the separation is realized by controlling the magnitude of magnetic force. Owing to the differences in their magnetic susceptibility, the levitating position of the components in the mixtures is uniquely identifiable. The aggregates of sorbitol were levitated upwards and those of sucrose were levitated downward. As the magnitude of the magnetic force was reduced, the sucrose and then the sorbitol fell in that order, and therefore they could be collected separately. The mechanism of this effect is attributed to the 8.2% difference in the volumetric magnetic susceptibilities of sucrose and sorbitol and the compressed oxygen gas. In the separation process, the falling particulates were distributed in an hourglass shape. This phenomenon was induced by the horizontal component of the magnetic force. The curvilinear surface was in good agreement with a numerical simulation.",

In this study, an original laboratory-scale device was used to study the effect of process and composition variables on \u03b2-lactoglobulin aggregation. Experiments were carried under processing-like conditions: high protein concentration (2\u201310% w/w), high heating (1\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0s\u22121) and cooling (2\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0s\u22121) rates, concentrated ionic environment (2.2\u201311\u00a0mM of CaCl2) and shear (0\u2013400\u00a0s\u22121). Different holding times (0\u2013240\u00a0s) and temperatures (67\u201395\u00a0\u00b0C) have been tested. The use of two distinct granulometric methods (laser granulometry and Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement) enabled monitoring of the kinetics of aggregate formation with information on size and concentration. The process conditions have an important influence on the functional properties of the suspension: the median volume diameter goes from less than 2\u00a0\u03bcm for short time and static heat treatment up to 80\u00a0\u03bcm for long time. Applying shear during heat treatment decreases the concentration of small aggregates (1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) and increases the concentration of large aggregates (20\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm). Using the quantitative characterization of temperature and time impact, it is possible to select the optimal temperature to maximize denaturation and minimize size. With the \u03b2-lg solution used in this study, the optimal temperature is around 88\u00a0\u00b0C.",

The samples were stored at 253 or 258\u00a0K under atmospheric pressure. It was found that preservation of the CO2 hydrate was better for the lower sucrose mass fraction and lower temperature. The effect of particle size was not clearly observed. The mass fractions of CO2 hydrate in the samples at the end of three weeks exceeded 0.02, which is equivalent to carbonated water.

However, principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the size and molecular weight are the most distinctive variables. The rheological investigation indicated that pLBG exhibit Newtonian flow behavior at a concentration less or equal to 0.1% (w/v) and shear-thinning behavior for higher concentrations (0.5\u20132%).

During the analysis, it was observed that the coordinate of chromaticity a* of the CIELAB system was highly influenced by the use of different sources in the illumination system. The differences in color were visually perceived when a single subclass of ripening was observed under different lamps, mistakenly influencing the grading during packing, thus making it necessary to standardize the illumination used in the systems of visual inspection for the commercialization of fruits.",

The combination between chitosan and PPR in term of antifungal activity was also examined. The selected 0.5% w/v chitosan concentration and all tested C/PPR ratios (1:1; 2:1; 3:1) led to a satisfactory process efficiency in term of yield (ranging from 69.8% to 73.2%), encapsulation efficiency (ranging from 80.1% to 84.9%) and particle size (ranging from 5.15 to 9.28\u00a0\u03bcm). The formulation produced starting from 1:1 C/PPR ratio (C-PPR/1), showed the highest polyphenol content (APC 6.63%) with respect to the other formulations. Due to the correlation between polyphenol content and functionality of PPR, C-PPR/1 was chosen for the successive studies. The C-PPR/1 powder resulted stable and handling also showing high water dissolution rate with respect to the unprocessed PPR. Interestingly, the combination of chitosan and PPR extract was able to enhance the antifungal activity comparing to raw extract, suggesting a potential synergy in the action or enhancement of bioavailability of the antimicrobial molecules.

Though several strategies have been proposed for fresh fish authentication, their classification ability is strongly affected by the fish species being considered.In this paper, we propose three different strategies based on latent variable modeling techniques in order to develop a multi-species classifier of the fresh/frozen\u2013thawed status of fish samples using near-infrared spectra. Whereas the first two strategies model the information related to the species and to the fish together (either jointly or sequentially), the third strategy aims at explicitly separating them to improve the classification performance.The proposed strategies were validated over a database of more than 1200 samples of several different species, with near-infrared spectra collected with two different instruments. The overall classification accuracies ranged between 80% and 91%, according to the strategy and the instrument used.

For this proposal, the thyme drying process was analyzed at different drying air temperatures (T) (40\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C), drying air velocities (va) (1\u20133\u00a0m/s) and levels of power ultrasound (US) (0, 6.2, 12.3, 18.5\u00a0kW\u00a0m\u22123). The essential oil was extracted by means of a supercritical fluid extraction method, and its AC was measured by FRAP. The drying velocity and the AC of the dried thyme extracts were both influenced by the magnitude of the air velocity and temperature, and also by power ultrasound. Artificial neural networks were developed to formulate and solve the optimization problem. The developed management tool allowed the optimal conditions of the process to be established, thereby maximizing the AC values in function of the raw materials, process characteristics and room air conditions.",

To enable this work, the influence of water content on the onset glass transition temperature was measured along with the sorption isotherm of the powder. The ring shear testing showed that the maltodextrin powder readily formed a very strong cake over time when it was exposed to temperatures that were at or above its onset glass transition temperature.

The utilisation of engineered microgels in foods has so far been limited, despite their great potential to address several needs in the food industry, including: satiety control, encapsulation of phytonutrients and prebiotics, texture control for healthier food formulations (e.g. reduced fat products), and targeting delivery to specific areas in the digestive tract. We review the scientific and patent literature on the utilisation and manufacturing methods for producing microgels with an emphasis on micro-hydrogels for food applications.",

     "abstract": "Sorbet produced without aeration is a dispersion of ice crystals distributed randomly in a freeze-concentrated liquid phase. The rheological properties of this suspension will be affected by the viscosity of the continuous liquid phase and the volume fraction of ice crystals. The knowledge of the viscosity of sorbet is essential for the improvement of product quality, the selection of process equipment, and for the optimal design of piping systems. This work aimed firstly, at studying the influence of the ice volume fraction (determined by the product temperature) on the apparent viscosity of a commercial sorbet, and secondly, to propose a rheological model that describes the evolution of the viscosity of the product as a function of the ice volume fraction. The rheology of sorbet was measured in situ by means of a pipe rheometer connected at the outlet of a continuous scraped surface heat exchanger (SSHE). The pipe rheometer was composed of a series of pipes in PVC of different diameters, making it possible to apply a range of apparent shear rate from 4 to 430\u00a0s\u22121. The flow behaviour index of sorbet decreased as the temperature of the product decreased, the effect of which indicates that the product becomes more shear thinning as the freezing of sorbet occurs. The consistency coefficient and therefore the magnitude of the apparent viscosity of sorbet increased with the decrease in product temperature and with the increase of the ice volume fraction. Results also showed that the rheological model described the experimental data within a 20% error.",

Rather than relying on human experts to build features sets to tune their parameters, our method uses simulated evolution to construct series of transforms that convert the input apple images into high quality features. The use of this method demonstrates the feasibility of using machine vision technology with the off-the-shelf optical and electronics components to detect true bruises and blemishes on apples with higher than 94% accuracy.

At a high concentration of surfactant (S/O\u00a0=\u00a01.5), d-limonene nanoemulsions could be obtained. In addition, the formation of nanoemulsions may be primarily related to the viscosity of oil phase. When the oil phase contained less than 15% (w/w) olive oil, the nanoemulsions could be prepared. The turbidities and the mean particle diameters of d-limonene nanoemulsions with adding the same concentration of different plant oils were similar. Furthermore, it can be found that adding olive oil could enhance the stability of d-limonene nanoemulsion system and decrease Ostwald ripening rate, and the Ostwald ripening rate of d-limonene nanoemulsion at 4\u00a0\u00b0C was higher than that at 28\u00a0\u00b0C.",

During storage, texture of the control became firmer due to amylopectin retrogradation confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. Conversely, gel sheets containing modified starches showed less texture change. Dough viscoelasticity of the formulations substituted by hydroxypropylated starch were much softer and easier to deform than that of the control one. Dough with hydroxypropylated-crosslinked starch was, however, stiffer and more strain-resistant. Moreover, the formulation comprising the mixture of both types of modified starches and xanthan gum gave dough viscoelasticity similar to that of the control, and provided gel sheet the least texture change.

(2012) employed a spinning disc apparatus to study deposition of fats on cooled stainless steel surfaces using model solutions of tripalmitin in non-crystallising paraffin. The apparatus was modified to give more accurate estimation of the test surface temperature, allowing the surface temperature and shear stress to be manipulated independently. The effect of different starting modes, simulating various situations which arise in pipelines, was studied. When fouling is induced by a step change in the test surface temperature, the presence of a subcooled surface promotes the rapid formation, initially, of a gel layer, followed by a period of linear fouling, and eventually falling rate fouling behaviour. When fouling is driven by a change in concentration the initial gel formation step is absent. The linear fouling regime was relatively insensitive to temperature, shear stress and starting mode for the conditions studied here. In the falling rate regime, the rate was determined by the deposit/solution interface temperature, following normal growth kinetics. At low tripalmitin concentrations, of 2.5\u00a0wt.%, sigmoidal growth behaviour was observed, which is attributed to the wall shear stress being initially high enough to disrupt the gel. As time proceeded, the gel increased in strength and was able to grow as before.",

Air-coupled ultrasonic measurements were performed on vacuum packaged sliced dry-cured ham, and compared with contact measurements. The average ultrasonic velocity in dry-cured ham was 1846\u00a0\u00b1\u00a049\u00a0m/s and 1842\u00a0\u00b1\u00a042\u00a0m/s for air-coupled and contact measurements, respectively. The deviation (1% relative error) between both techniques was related to the influence of the heterogeneous structure and composition of dry-cured ham and the transducer focusing. The SAM was used to characterize dry-cured ham and chorizo samples. B-scan images for dry-cured ham and chorizo showed two dominant reflections from the sample, linked to reflections in the lean and fatty tissues. The results indicate that contact ultrasonic measurements could be replaced by the air-coupled technique, reducing the measuring time and the material handling.

The colour trajectory during the food decomposition process under room temperature storage conditions was recorded and compared with the preferred colour obtained from the subjective test. People tended to prefer foods with higher chroma, which indicates more vivid colour than the original food colour, whereas the chroma of most foods decreased during the decomposition process. Therefore, the colour shifts that occurred during the food decomposition process were found to be qualitatively the opposite of the food-colour preference. This result implies that the food-colour preference may have a significant association with the human tendency to select fresher and non-contaminated foods using visual perception, which may be influenced by both inherited traits and empirical learning.

Simulation results indicated that the metallic temperature sensors did not change the overall heating patterns within food samples.

     "abstract": "Olive oil extraction using a horizontal centrifuge with a screw conveyor is an essential operation to reduce production costs. However, proper control of the plant is required to maintain a high level of extraction yield and olive oil quality. Rheological characteristics of the olive paste, which change in relation to water content, fruit variety, maturity level and seasonal temperature variations, greatly affect the efficiency of centrifugal extraction. If olive paste is fed to a decanter without automatic control, then non-optimal extraction is performed.After successfully testing a suitable flow mass sensor in order to set up an automatic system to control the olive paste mass flow rate fed to a decanter centrifuge during olive oil extraction, a feedback control system was tested in the laboratory and built in-line in an industrial processing plant. This allowed trials to be carried out at constant mass flow rate for both the paste and the added water, on a decanter centrifuge with variable differential speed between bowl and screw conveyor (i.e. variable DN) and with regulation capability of oil\u2013water ring levels. Constant quality olives (cv. Coratina) were used for the trials; the correlation was evaluated between oil/water ring levels and DN with respect to the extraction yield, husk fat content and vegetable water fat content.The \u201coil recovery efficiency\u201d (\u03b7o) and \u201cseparation coefficient\u201d S peaked with maximum residence time, using DN\u00a0=\u00a013.3 and RING\u00a0=\u00a0284.8, while \u03b7o minimum was achieved at higher DN. More specifically, for DN values higher than about 18 or lesser than 12, \u03b7o becomes independent of RING. Furthermore, \u03b7o and S values are strictly related to the geometry of the decanter centrifuge, whereas the paste dilution ratio determines the preservation quality of the oil extracted, and the maximum oil recovery efficiency represents the remaining objective related to the quantity of extracted oil.From experimental data some interesting relations were found linking decanter centrifuge parameters; their relationship depends on a complete quadratic interaction model constituted by the input variables that leads to highly correlated polynomials between DN vs. Uopdb (\u201cmass fraction of oil in the fed olive paste\u201d (dry basis)) and \u03b7o optimal vs. Uopdb. These relations allow optimization of DN and RING values such that maximum oil recovery efficiency is achieved. Indeed, knowledge of Uopdb by an on-line method allows the decanter DN and RING operating parameters, to be calculated and modified at once, obtaining optimal maximum oil recovery efficiency.",

     "abstract": "The usefulness of amaranth protein isolates, native and thermally treated, in edible films preparation was studied. Protein films were prepared by casting using glycerol as plasticizer. Films from amaranth native protein isolates showed low water vapor permeability (WVP) but poor mechanical properties. In order to improve this functionality, proteins were treated at 70 and 90\u00a0\u00b0C which corresponds to the denaturation temperature of the protein fractions present in the isolates. The unfolded conformation of these thermally treated proteins, when partially or totally denatured, favors the interactions between polypeptide chains during the film formation. These interactions lead to a greater cross-linking degree, which was reflected in the lower amount of water-soluble free peptides that were linked to the matrix. In these thermally treated protein films, a greatest contribution of disulfide and hydrogen bonds to the films stabilization was observed. These changes in the films structural properties would confer them a greater tensile strength and lower water solubility but higher thickness and WVP.",

The fine tuning of the sol concentration and viscosity as well as the dip-coating extraction rate, allowed to deposit on the external surface of the PET support uniform coatings with controllable thickness at the sub-micron scale. FTIR microspectroscopic and tapping mode-Atomic Force Microscopy (TM-AFM) measurements were used to characterize the prepared coatings.The antimicrobial activity of the obtained surface modified films was tested on agar plates against Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Furthermore, the stability of the coating was evaluated in order to verify a possible migration of lysozyme to a liquid media (buffered solution at pH 6.2), due to a possible release from the plastic substrate. The quantitative determination of the released lysozyme in the buffered solution was performed by HPLC UV-DAD.

This CA-based model is shown to be able to describe the oil migration in an adequate manner and can therefore be used to calculate an effective diffusion coefficient. Further, the potential of a CA-based approach for the further investigation of the fat bloom mechanisms is demonstrated by means of a case study where capillary rise is incorporated in the CA-based model.",

A simulated storage modulus (G\u2032) model agreed satisfactorily with experimental observations. The gelation of 3% CW solutions was done using static conditions during the whole process (90\u20135\u00a0\u00b0C), or by applying a shear rate (180, 300 and 600\u00a0s\u22121) during cooling from 90\u00a0\u00b0C to 52\u00a0\u00b0C and then continuing the cooling under static conditions up to the final temperature (i.e. 5\u00a0\u00b0C). The proposed model predicts G\u2032 evolution as a function of temperature, and considers the final torque (\u0393f) of the sheared stage as an inductor of molecular flow alignment. Predictions revealed that the final solid-like component (i.e. G\u2032) increases as the shear rate increases up to a maximum for a shear rate of about 400\u00a0s\u22121. Then, final G\u2032 value diminishes gradually, probably due to the destruction of microstructures that generate the gelation. The model was validated by graphical methods and variance measures. The results demonstrate the potential of CFD to allow the development of a model linking process variables (i.e. cooling and shearing) and rheological properties. This model can be successfully applied for process control purposes and for the design of organogels with predefined properties.",

This mechanical treatment induced the separation of parenchyma irregular cell clusters into regular single cells, modifying both the morphology and the particle size distribution of purees. A separation\u2013reconstitution step made it possible to obtain samples with a wide range of insoluble solids (8\u201324\u00a0g/kg). Pectin was added to some of the samples in order to increase the viscosity of the continuous phase. The rheological behaviour and structural properties of the modified apple purees were investigated using flow and oscillatory rheological measurements, particle size measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Rheological properties such as apparent viscosity, yield stress and elastic modulus decreased as particle size decreased and they increased as insoluble solids content increased. Modelling of rheological properties with master curves made it possible to take into account the apparent relative volume occupied by the particles of different sizes.",

A wide range of methods have been used to evaluate instrumental results, which provide time-series data of product deformation, thereby allowing a wide range of texture attributes to be calculated from force\u2013time or force\u2013displacement data. Several indices of texture such as the firmness index, crunchiness index and texture index based on \u201cvibration energy density\u201d have been reported, but these are not widely used to quantify food texture. Some modeling and statistical approaches have been adopted to analyze food texture data, including chemical reaction kinetics and the Michaelis\u2013Menton type decay function, mechanistic autocatalytic models based on logistic equation, and the finite element method. However, increasing demand for comprehensive approaches to texture profile analysis, generalized texture indices and fundamental texture models still remain challenges in the food research and industry.",

Each ANN was optimized using a genetic algorithm. The root-mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination B allowed to choose the best ANN. The results showed that it was possible to distinguish five classes where the composition of each class Ci could be described accurately and connected with the mechanical behavior of the films.

The HA starch:glycerol (G) ratio was maintained at 80:20 (on dry solid basis) and the concentration of wax was varied from 5% and 10% (w/w). The melted wax samples were homogenized with HAG dispersion with or without Tween-80 and the films were prepared by solution casting. The hydrophobicity and water-barrier properties in these films were determined by using contact angle (CA), water vapour permeability (Kw) tests, and water sorption isotherm at 0.529 RH and 20\u00a0\u00b0C. The Kw values of the HAG films decreased significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with the addition of 5% concentration of these waxes. Then the addition of Tween-80 to the HAG\u00a0+\u00a0wax films increased the Kw values significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The presence of these waxes in the presence and absence of Tween-80 resulted into different sorption isotherms and the water adsorptivity and moisture diffusion coefficient values were also affected. The presence of Tween-80 increased the CA in HAG\u00a0+\u00a0carnauba wax films while the CA was found to decrease in the case of other two waxes.

Starting from the histograms of the channels of the Red\u2013Green\u2013Blue (RGB), CIELAB and Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color spaces, we construct an initial input parameter vector and perform a feature extraction previous to the classification. Several linear and non-linear feature extraction techniques were evaluated, and the classifiers used were Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The best classification rate achieved was 87.66%, obtained using Kernel Principal Components Analysis (KPCA) and a grade-3-polynomial kernel SVM.

In this study, we evaluated the influence of freezing rates on the microstructure, stability and physicochemical properties of model emulsion-based sauces. Slow freezing (\u22120.015\u00a0\u00b0C/min) resulted in a larger mean particle size than fast freezing (\u22120.11\u00a0\u00b0C/min), which was attributed to increased fat droplet flocculation and coalescence. The influence of various additives (salt, sugar, gums) on the properties of the sauces was also investigated. The addition of 200\u00a0mmol/L NaCl promoted droplet flocculation and phase separation whereas 150\u00a0mmol/L sucrose inhibited droplet flocculation and phase separation, and inhibited ice crystal growth. The addition of 0.2% xanthan gum promoted flocculation, but inhibited phase separation and ice crystal growth. Our results are interpreted in terms of the influence of the additives on the phase behavior of water, and the colloidal interactions between the fat droplets.

To achieve this goal, wicking patterns (oil penetration rate and oil front shape versus time) of both fresh and prolonged fried extra virgin olive oil are optically registered at six different paper stripes. Four of them are double-ply towel papers whereas the other two are single-ply chromatographic papers. Wicking tests are performed at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 30\u00a0\u00b0C. It is shown that the type of paper affects seriously the wicking patterns. Double-ply papers present high oil penetration rates but very irregular oil front shapes whereas single-ply papers yield lower oil penetration rates but pretty flat oil fronts. Furthermore, it is found that only under certain conditions the penetration rates obey the well known Lucas\u2013Washburn equation. A discussion is made on the phenomena that take place during wicking of oil into paper which may cause deviations from the Lucas\u2013Washburn equation. A semi-empirical model is proposed to describe the above deviations by incorporating the effect of time evolving pore sizes.",

A digital color imaging system, calibrated to provide accurate CIELAB color measurements, was employed to record the visual characteristics of eyes and gills.

Fifteen spinach leaves were put inside Petri dishes covered with three different plastic films and stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 21\u00a0days. Hyperspectral images were taken during this storage. A radiometric correction is proposed in order to avoid the variation in transmittance of the plastic films during time in the hyperspectral images. Afterwards, three spectral pre-processing procedures (no pre-process, Savitsky\u2013Golay and Standard Normal Variate, combined with Principal Component Analysis) were applied to obtain different models. The corresponding artificial images of scores were studied by means of Analysis of Variance to compare their ability to sense the aging of the leaves. All models were able to monitor the aging through storage. Radiometric correction seemed to work properly and could allow the supervision of shelf-life in leafy vegetables through commercial transparent films.",

     "abstract": "Gas transfer properties of wheat gluten (WG) coated paper and their ability to fulfil the requirements in eMAP of fresh parsley were studied. Permeation of gases through WG-paper was demonstrated to be RH-dependent and closely related to structural modification in the WG layer. Formation of micro-cracks was evidenced in dry conditions; but when increasing RH, plasticisation occurs within the protein layer and micro-fractures were reduced until disappearance. This reversible phenomenon allowed the WG-layer to recover its integrity at RH higher than 70%, and the WG character to be expressed in such conditions. When used at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 80% RH as part of the packaging of parsley, modified atmosphere was created and a steady state of 11\u00a0kPa O2 and 4.5\u00a0kPa CO2 was reached after 45\u00a0h. In such conditions, the overall quality of parsley leaves remained acceptable during 8\u00a0days, with only 28% loss of chlorophyll.",

     "abstract": "Integrative mathematical modelling for Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) has been used to determine the gas composition inside a package, but can also be used to determine the packaging needs of fresh produce in terms of permeability to gases and water vapour. Transpiration rate (TR) is an important physiological process that influences relative humidity (RH) and condensation inside the package, and ultimately quality and shelf life. Strawberries are an extremely valuable crop, but they are susceptible to grey mould rot, fungal decay, moisture loss and condensation. Quantification of strawberry transpiration rate TR would be required to estimate the packaging material water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) and therefore optimise engineering packaging design. This study investigated (i) the impact of temperature and RH on strawberry TR, (ii) developed a predictive model for quantifying TR, (iii) integrated transpiration rate model into the engineering packaging design and quantified the target WVTR for packaging of strawberry and (iv) validated packaging design by comparison to commercial packaging. Experiments were conducted following an experimental design, considering two factors at three levels (32), i.e. temperature (5, 10 and 15\u00a0\u00b0C) and RH (76%, 86% and 96%); TR was recorded during 5\u00a0days of storage. The results showed that both RH and temperature had a significant effect on TR. In a given temperature and RH range of study, it varied from 0.24 to 1.16\u00a0g/kg\u00a0h. Mathematical model developed considering the effect of temperature and RH, was further validated at 12\u00a0\u00b0C and 76% RH, showing very good predictability (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.997). The TR model was found to be useful for describing the strawberry packaging requisites and for optimal engineering packaging design for strawberry. The target WVTR for achieving optimal RH of 90% at 5\u00a0\u00b0C was found to be 162\u00a0g/m2\u00a0day. Packaging design validation showed that the package designed considering both gas and water vapour requisites of strawberry yielded favourable results for maintaining quality and shelf life of product.",

     "abstract": "Food engineering (FE) was identified as a promising field in the mid-20th century. In the succeeding years, demand for food engineers in industry has continued unabated, but the field, in an academic sense, has not quite lived up to its potential. Yet, the coming challenges of the 21st century offer many opportunities for persons with FE training. This article is based on a plenary session held during the Conference of Food Engineering 2012, in Leesburg, Virginia, USA, and consists of a compilation of opinions of the authors. In order to develop further, FE needs to shed its historical mindset, and embrace a broader vision of its scope to include product, internal human and industrial processes, equipment, package and sensor/automation engineering. Training in FE could be vital to helping address issues such as water availability and quality, health and wellness, food safety, energy and sustainability. A number of 21st century developments will drive this change, including world population growth and aging; the digital universe, \u201cbig data\u201d and informatics; personalization, food, health and wellness; food security, environment, sustainability and social responsibility; and the innovation ecosystem (open innovation and partnerships). Food engineering education will also have to change to keep pace with the extraordinary expansion of knowledge, the availability of virtual tools, diminishing funding and laboratory resources, and the possibility of creating partnerships between industry and academia. Studying inner transport phenomena, utilization of new techniques, such as micro processing for modeling and simulation of the digestion system, bioavailability, satiety, DNA predisposition, and nutrigenomics offer unique opportunities. The case of FE in UK and Europe are addressed, where consortia involving different industries have been able to partner to focus on problems with a common scientific theme to leverage their efforts. Finally, the experience of one food company in hiring food engineers as well as chemical engineers is highlighted, together with their interview processes and criteria. While this represents a collection of the opinions of the individual authors, it is hoped that the discussion stimulates a more wide-ranging conversation about FE to enable it to develop further into the 21st century.",

Separating cuticle from flesh of the cherry tomatoes after HPT and examining the pesticide residues in each part the following was found: the detectable pesticide amount in the flesh part showed little change from the non-treated samples. Ethanol was applied as the surrounding solution during pressurization so as to prevent the reattachment of pesticide and decrease water solubility, and removal efficiency declined little. The effect of HPT on removal rate time indicated no significant difference at 0.1\u00a0MPa, the optimum level to be at 75\u00a0MPa for a comparatively short time, and at 400\u00a0MPa removal rate increased with time.",

Moreover, the development of alternating technologies like direct Joule effect (ohmic) heating to pasteurise and sterilise liquid food products in a continuous process is of great scientific and industrial interest. Heat treatment by direct Joule effect exhibits numerous advantages because rapid heating kinetics or homogeneous heat treatment is required.

This work used HPLC to investigate the retention behaviors of the disaccharides (lactulose and lactose) and the by-products of lactulose production (glucose, galactose and fructose) under varying experimental conditions such as electric potential difference, central cell compartment electrolyte concentration and electro-activation time. The results were then correlated with the electric current density, the electrical global resistance of the system, the pH, the temperature and the Joule heating effect. The highest lactulose yield that was obtained during the isomerization of lactose was \u224830% at a voltage of U\u00a0=\u00a028\u00a0V, an electrolyte concentration CNa2SO4\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0M, a temperature T\u00a0=\u00a026\u00a0\u00b0C, an alkaline medium pH\u00a0=\u00a010.79, and a running time \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0min.",

     "abstract": "Increasing oil temperature and heating duration in deep-fat frying of potato chips can improve textural quality but worsen the chemical safety of acrylamide formation. Optimal design of this complex process is formulated as a non-linear constrained optimization problem where the objective is to compute the oil temperature profile that guarantees the desired final moisture content while minimizing final acrylamide content subject to operating constraints and the process dynamics. The process dynamics uses a multicomponent and multiphase transport model in the potato as a porous medium taken from literature. Results show that five different heating zones offer a good compromise between process duration (shorter the better) and safety in terms of lower acrylamide formation. A short, high temperature zone at the beginning with a progressive decrease in zone temperatures was found to be the optimal design. The multi-zone optimal operating conditions show significant advantages over nominal constant temperature processes, opening new avenues for optimization.",

Thus, an effective technology to predict meat quality is highly desirable for the meat industry. Among many emerging technologies, optical methods have the greatest potential since they are fast, nondestructive, and generally low cost. This study evaluated the potential application of laser biospeckle technique and its methods of image processing in order to assess and quantify biological phenomena related to beef aging. Samples of muscle Longissimus thoracis were aged for 21\u00a0days and underwent biospeckle analysis, objective color and Warner\u2013Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF). According to the results, biospeckle laser parameters may, possibly, assess biological activity resulting from action of endogenous enzymes (calpains and cathepsins) responsible for the aging process through its correlation (R\u00a0=\u00a00.6146) with analysis of WBSF and of the correlation (\u22120.7973) with aging time. High correlation of biospeckle analysis, related to traditional out puts and to new proposals, were obtained to color parameters, especially hue angle (h*) whose R value was 0.7953, redness intensity (R\u00a0=\u00a00.8120) and percentage of metmyoglobin (MMb) showed that R value of 0.9119, demonstrates the potential of this technique for evaluating quality of meat color.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well as dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were also performed and their results used to explain the observed combined effects. The combined effects were noted to have a statistically insignificant influence on the moisture content, thickness and water vapor permeability of the films. On the other hand, the combined effects had a statistically significant influence on the color, degree of crystallinity, degree of swelling, tensile strength, percent elongation and oxygen permeability of the films. Only the galangal extract concentration had a statistically significant influence on the film opacity.

     "abstract": "1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) is a synthetic plant growth regulator used commercially to delay ripening of fruits. The substance is applied in gas form (as a fumigant) in the storage room. In long term postharvest cold storage, fruit are placed in boxes (usually plastic or wooden bins) and stacked in a specific pattern. The top of the boxes are frequently covered with a thin plastic sheet for the purpose of reducing fruit moisture loss. Wooden boxes, card linings and other plant based porous materials used in bins have 1-MCP adsorption capacity. Plastic covers affect the airflow and with that the 1-MCP transport. In this paper, the influence of box materials and plastic cover on the distribution of 1-MCP in cold storage was studied using validated CFD models. Reynolds Average Navier\u2013Stokes equations with the SST k\u2013\u03c9 turbulence model were used to calculate the airflow. Diffusion, convection and adsorption of 1MCP were modeled to obtain 3D spatial and temporal distributions of 1-MCP inside a storage container, boxes and fruit. Time dependent profiles of calculated 1-MCP concentrations in the air in the container agreed well with measurement data. The plastic cover imposed no effect on the adsorption of 1-MCP. Wooden boxes notably adsorbed 1-MCP from the treatment atmosphere and may reduce the efficacy and uniformity of the treatment.",

Bleaching earth was added to palm oil in a range of 0.5\u20133.0\u00a0wt%. Results presented in this work suggest that adsorption of \u03b2-carotene increases with temperature, while phosphorus adsorption was less affected. Both the pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model describe efficiently the \u03b2-carotene experimental data. Intra-particle diffusion is involved in \u03b2-carotene adsorption mechanism, although it is not the sole rate limiting step in the adsorption onto acid activated bleaching earth. Phosphorus adsorption was too fast resulting in a lack of kinetic data. The equilibrium data were described better by Langmuir and Freundlich models, for \u03b2-carotene and phosphorus, respectively. A multi-component Freundlich type isotherm was tested. Its competition coefficients were too low, and it assumed the same form as the monocomponent Freundlich. A thermodynamic study demonstrated that \u03b2-carotene and phosphorus adsorption is spontaneous, endothermic and an entropy-driven process. Isosteric heat values suggest that the interactions between adsorbate and adsorbent are heterogeneous.",

When soaking temperature was increased the hydration rate increased and both the lag phase and the moisture at the equilibrium decreased. These behaviour were, then, modelled as function of the soaking temperature (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.99). The obtained results are potentially useful for future studies on product development, food properties and process design.",

However, due to electrostatic repulsion between similarly charged particles, shells composed of single-type nanoparticles tend to be monolayer-thick and relatively permeable. We investigated a self-assembly method for controlling the permeability of colloidal shells using aggregates composed of oppositely charged silica nanoparticles. Using a combination of rapid fluorescence based method and theoretical diffusion models, we found that colloidosomes whose shells contained colloidal silica aggregates displayed lower permeability to peroxyl radicals than ones stabilized by single type of silica nanoparticles. Furthermore, the permeability varied as a function of the ratio of oppositely charged silica nanoparticles in the shell. The ability to control the permeability of colloidosomes, while using a simple self-assembly synthesis method, will enable enhanced control over release kinetics and oxidative stability of encapsulants.",

When compared to the original work, one additional parameter, k needs to be estimated but still only one isotherm and one value of net isosteric heat of sorption is required to build the whole set of sorption isotherms.

Data gathered included velocity vectors, shear rate, and mixing index. Increasing mixer speed increased velocity magnitudes in the horizontal and vertical directions. Fluid inflow rate had little impact on velocity in the horizontal and vertical directions, but increased velocity in the axial direction and elongational contribution to the mixing index. All configurations showed areas of simple shear flow where the fluid experienced high shear rates. Staggering paddles increased the maximum axial velocity and shear rate.

Specifically, the effects of mixing and fermentation times on the extensional properties of dough were characterized under small extensional strains of short duration. From the stress and strain responses measured, the tensile storage and loss moduli of dough were obtained as a function of mixing and fermentation times. There were significant changes in the tensile moduli of the dough samples over mixing times and in general high extensional properties were measured for the optimally-mixed dough. Fermentation caused the reduction of both tensile storage/loss moduli with a greater decrease in the storage moduli, clearly showing the loss of elasticity of the fermenting dough. The results showed that the short duration of the applied strain allows the impulse viscoelastic technique to be appropriately used in characterizing the rheology of foods which can vary during processing.",

Four active ingredients (antioxidants) were added, namely basil essential oil, thyme essential oil, citric acid and \u03b1-tocopherol. The starch:antioxidant mass ratio was 1:0.1. Prior to characterisation, the films were conditioned at 25\u00a0\u00b0C\u201353%RH as to their structural, mechanical, optical and barrier properties. The antioxidant capacity of the active ingredients was determined by means of a spectrophotometric method. The incorporation of antioxidants led to a heterogeneous film microstructure, mainly in those containing \u03b1-tocopherol, which affected the surface roughness. Yellowness was induced in films when \u03b1-tocopherol was added and no notable colour changes were observed in the other cases, although all the antioxidants increased the transparency of the films. Despite of the fact that the mechanical properties were barely affected by the incorporation of antioxidants, citric acid promoted an increase in the elastic modulus but a decrease in film stretchability. The water vapour barrier properties of the films were only slightly improved when citric acid and \u03b1-tocopherol were added, whereas the oxygen barrier properties were significantly improved in all cases. The greatest antioxidant capacity of the films was reported for films containing \u03b1-tocopherol, which exhibited the highest antioxidant power.",

An increase in both moduli of the samples with XG addition indicates network structure being strengthened. All gel samples exhibited distinct fracture.

Decreasing moisture content may lead to phase separation between sugar-rich and polymer-rich phases to form stronger connection within the network structure.

The fastest moving particle velocity was identified using over 299 particles and a radio-frequency identification technique, and used as an input to the model for the worst-case heating scenario.

The influence of the nature of the continuous phase on bubbly liquid rheology was investigated using bubbly liquids prepared in the same planetary mixer using a viscous liquid, honey (almost constant shear viscosity with a small elastic contribution) and a shear-thinning liquid (1\u00a0wt% aqueous solution of guar gum). The viscosity of the honey was similar to the low-shear-rate limit viscosity of the guar gum solution. Although similar bubble volume fractions (up to 25%) were entrained in each liquid under identical mixing conditions, the bubble diameters in the shear-thinning liquid were about two to three times larger than those in the honey. Introduction of a surfactant into the shear-thinning liquid increased the volume fraction of bubbles to approx. 40% and further increased the size of the bubbles. The presence of the bubbles in the honey caused it to become shear-thinning, to exhibit noticeable elastic effects and exert significant normal stress differences. The honey-based bubbly liquids exhibited many of the features in the simulations of Loewenberg and Hinch (1996) and fitted the model of Llewellin et al. (2002) well. In the guar gum solution, these characteristics, already present, were accentuated strongly by the presence of the bubbles. Subjecting both types of bubbly liquids to high shear rates caused the volume fraction of bubbles to decrease and made the bubbly liquids less shear-thinning. Noticeable thixotropy was observed. Shear-thinning, associated with bubble deformation, was observed at lower values of the relative shear stress in the shear-thinning liquid.",

The model equations were solved on the pear cortex tissue geometry (referred here after as geometry) using the finite element method. The different water transport properties of the microstructural components were obtained experimentally or from literature. The effective water conductivity of pear cortex tissue was calculated based on the microscale simulations. The values corresponded well with measured values of tissue water transport parameters.

     "abstract": "Optimisation of package design for citrus fruit is required to increase the throughput, by reducing the precooling time, and to enhance fruit quality by providing fast and uniform cooling without inducing chilling injury. The cooling performance of an existing container and of two new containers (Supervent and Ecopack), as stacked on a pallet, was evaluated experimentally and numerically with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The accuracy of the CFD simulations was confirmed by a good agreement with experiments. The best cooling performance was found for Ecopack, but removing airflow short circuits in this container may enhance the cooling performance even more. Also with respect to uniformity of cooling of the fruit and the magnitude of the convective heat transfer coefficients, in a specific container and between different containers on the pallet, the Ecopack container performed best, followed by the Supervent and the standard container. The new container designs thus clearly showed significant improvements in cooling performance.",

The degree of surface enrichment of both oil and sodium caseinate was found to increase with decreasing bulk levels of the respective components. Surface enrichment of oil was also affected by processing conditions (emulsion drop size and drying temperature), but surface enrichment of sodium caseinate was relatively insensitive to these.

     "abstract": "Vacuum frying (1.33\u00a0kPa), with the aid of a de-oiling mechanism, was used to produce low-fat sweet potato chips. The kinetics of oil absorption and oil distribution in the chips (total, internal, and surface oil content) was studied so that effectiveness of the de-oiling system could be established. Product quality attributes (PQAs) such as moisture content, oil content, diameter shrinkage, and thickness expansion, as well as, color, texture, bulk density, true density, and porosity of chips fried at different temperatures (120, 130, and 140\u00a0\u00b0C) was performed to evaluate the effect of process temperature on the product.The final oil content of the vacuum fried chips was 60% lower than those found in traditionally fried sweet potato chip, which indicates that the de-oiling mechanism is crucial in vacuum frying processing. The rate of change in PQAs is greatly affected by temperature; however, the final values of bulk density, true density, porosity, diameter shrinkage, and thickness expansion were not affected by temperature. The structured of the chips settled faster when fried at 130\u2013140\u00a0\u00b0C. Color b\u2217 values was not affected by temperature by the range of temperature used in this study.The product fried in a two-stage (TS) frying process (1\u00a0min fried at atmospheric pressure and 2\u00a0min under vacuum) had better appearance and texture compared to the ones that were only fried under vacuum or single-stage (SS) conditions. The samples were lighter and more yellow (less compact) than the chips fried under the SS process. The atmospheric frying prior to vacuum frying helped the starch to gelatinize thus producing a better product in terms of texture, oil content, and flavor. The final oil content of the TS fried chips was 15% lower than those fried by the SS process showing that the structure of the chips formed during the process affected the oil absorption during frying.",

In this study, the suitability of using egg whites (EWs) and whole eggs (WEs) as model foods to evaluate the heating uniformity and to determine the cold and hot spots during microwave pasteurization was investigated. The samples were prepared from mixtures of water with commercial EW or WE powders at different solid concentrations (20%, 25%, 27.5%, and 30%) and salt contents (0, 50, 100, and 200\u00a0mM). Critical physical properties for desirable model food systems include appropriate dielectric properties, gelation temperatures, gel strengths, and water holding capacities (WHCs). The gelation temperature of liquid EW and WE were 70 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C; both fell in the pasteurization temperature range. At 915\u00a0MHz, the dielectric constants of liquid EW and WE samples and their heat induced gels decreased with solid concentration while the loss factor was not affected. Loss factors of liquid EW and WE samples increased linearly with salt addition, which could be explained by the linear increase of electrical conductivities by adding salt. The strength and WHC of heat induced EW and WE gels increased linearly with solid concentration, while salt addition had no significant effect. The results demonstrated the suitability of using EW and WE as model foods to determine the heating uniformity during microwave pasteurization process.",

The predicted required drying time was influenced predominantly by the effective moisture diffusion coefficient. A correlation to estimate the effective moisture diffusion coefficient was developed from published values and was used to predict the required drying time with an uncertainty of \u00b13.5\u00a0h at a 90% confidence interval. Since this magnitude of uncertainty is unreasonable for most industrial uses, accurate data collection of effective moisture diffusivity should be viewed as a major objective in pasta drying research.",

However, inefficient extraction techniques that are practiced at cottage level restrict its industrial applications. This work reports on the optimization of the technique of three phase partitioning (TPP) for efficient extraction of kokum kernel fat. The parameters of TPP were optimized with respect to ammonium sulphate concentration, ratio of slurry to t-butanol and pH of slurry. The optimized protocol resulted in maximum recovery of 95% (w/w) fat recovery within 2\u00a0h. The technique is economical and eco-friendly, and is promising for utilization of agro-processing waste in India to a product of commercial significance.",

Productions of natural cocoa butter fats are decreasing day by day due to the decrease of cocoa cultivation worldwide; moreover, cocoa fruit contains only a little amount of cocoa butter. Therefore, the food industries are keen to find the alternatives to cocoa butter fat and this issue has been contemplated among food manufacturers. This review offers an update of scientific research conducted in relation to the alternative fats of cocoa butter from natural sources. The findings highlights how these cocoa butter alternatives are being produced either by blending, modifying the natural oils or fats from palm oil, palm kernel oil, mango seed kernel fats, kokum butter fat, sal fat, shea butter, and illip\u00e9 fat.",

     "abstract": "Changes in the thermal and rheological properties of tapioca starch (TS) with and without xanthan gum (Xan) (total polysaccharide concentration\u00a0=\u00a025%\u00a0w/w) were investigated using a differential scanning calorimeter, Rheolograph Gel and Texture Analyser. The gelatinization temperatures of TS shifted to higher values with the Xan concentration. Xan enhanced the retrogradation of TS during the initial stage of storage but retarded the process for a further storage time at 5\u00a0\u00b0C. The onset temperature of all reheated TS/Xan gels decreased with increasing storage time indicating thermally unstable structure formation after a longer storage time. Storage Young\u2019s moduli (E\u2032) of the TS and TS/Xan gels stored at 5\u00a0\u00b0C increased with increasing storage time. The E\u2032 values became more temperature dependent with storage time due to the weak cross-linkage of amylopectin molecules in the gels but became less dependent in the system containing Xan. TS/Xan gels kept for 14\u00a0days showed lower Young\u2019s moduli than TS gels from the compression test confirming retardation of the retrogradation process by Xan. The results suggested that Xan could retard the retrogradation of TS gels for longer storage times.",

     "abstract": "Consumers want fresh food with a long shelf-life, which in 2010, resulted in an important increase in packaged and processed food. This is especially important for fishery products due to their highly perishable nature. One problem is that it is not possible to measure freshness in packaged food only using the visible spectrum. Moreover, the detection of freshness is a complex problem as fish has different tissues with different biodegradation processes. Therefore, it would be especially interesting to have a non-destructive method to evaluate the shelf-life of packed processed fish. This paper proposes a method for detecting expired packaged salmon. Firstly, this method uses hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy (HIS) using visible and SW-NIR wavelengths. Secondly, a classification of different salmon tissues is carried out by image segmentation. Finally, classifications of expired or non expired salmon are performed with the PLS-DA statistical multivariate method due to the large amount of captured data. In a similar way, spectral data and the physicochemical, biochemical and microbiological properties of salmon are correlated using partial least squares (PLSs). The result obtained has a classification success rate of 82.7% in cross-validation from real commercial samples of salmon. Therefore, this is a promising technique for the non-destructive detection of expired packaged smoked salmon.",

Water vapor permeability (WVP) of films containing essential oils decreased as the amount of essential oils increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Decreases in L*-value and increases in b*-, \u0394E*- and transparency value were observed with increasing amount of essential oils incorporated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). FTIR spectra indicated that films added with essential oils, especially from plai root, exhibited higher hydrophobicity than the control film, as evidenced by higher amplitude at wavenunber of 2877\u20132922\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1732\u00a0cm\u22121. Lower degradation temperature was obtained in films containing essential oils.

Using a meat sample with a clear denaturation distribution, we performed stress-relaxation measurements to obtain the elastic modulus and identified the state of water in the meat by using proton magnetic resonance imaging (1H MRI) for quantification of a transverse relaxation time (T2). Even after the complete denaturation of myosin, the elastic modulus did not exceed 14\u00a0kPa, which is not large compared with 6\u00a0kPa for unheated meat. However, when actin denaturation was initiated, the elastic modulus dramatically increased while the T2 value at the meat surface remarkably decreased. The difference in the state of water between the surface and the core reflected the uneven denaturation distribution in the meat caused by heating. When actin denaturation was complete, the elastic modulus reached 60\u00a0kPa, which was the equilibrium value, and T2 decreased and its distribution became more flat.",

Homogenization after heat treatment resulted in increased solubilization of the pectin, especially after \u03b2-elimination reactions.

From the oil yield results obtained for the two hybrids studied, black-hull (P20) and striped-hull hybrids (ACA 884), it could be observed that oil was extracted at different rates in both hybrids. Analyzing the performance data versus time in the control samples, ACA 884 oil was released more easily and remained invariant with time, whereas for P20 the extraction was slower and the maximum value was reached at 60\u00a0min. The fiber wall structure collapsed by the enzymatic action, improving oil release and allowing a faster extraction. The efficiency of the treatment was measured in terms of the percentage of increase in oil yield compared with the control samples. It was observed that in hybrid ACA 884 the mean increases were not significantly different (p\u00a0=\u00a00.9295) over time (4.12%\u00a0d.b.). Hybrid P20 showed a significant increase in the percentage of oil yield (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) at 10\u00a0min (10.85%\u00a0d.b.), and then it remained virtually constant over time (4.89%\u00a0d.b.).

The first detector, which relies on all the hyperspectral information, achieved a perfect detection accuracy in identifying parasite-infected clams. The second detector, which is based on a reduced number of hyperspectral bands, achieved an 85% detection accuracy.

     "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important cereals in the world. Before it is consumed, it is common to remove the hull, bran and germ from the rough rice kernel which is either parboiled or not. During such processing, rice kernels are subjected to mechanical stresses which cause some rice grains to break. A main challenge of the rice industry is to minimize the quantities of broken rice. We here review the factors impacting the breakage susceptibility of rice kernels. Their tendency to break is primarily determined by fissures, chalkiness, immaturity and rice kernel dimensions, properties which are both cultivar and rice grain history dependent. The intensity of processing of any given rice feedstock determines the actual level of broken rice kernels. If performed properly, parboiling, a three-step hydrothermal treatment consisting of soaking, heating and drying of rough rice, substantially reduces the level of broken kernels.",

An increase in ACP content from 0% to 12% significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased the specific mechanical energy input and reduced the lightness, redness, yellowness, water absorption index, and water solubility index of extrudates.

In this pursuit, an electronic tongue based on cyclic voltammetry is developed to discriminate honey samples based on their floral types and is described in this paper. The technique has been investigated using platinum as the working electrode and the resultant current from the potentiostat has been considered for data analysis. The use of principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminate analysis (LDA) proves to be useful in clustering honey samples.

The extracted spectral data and the measured quality parameters were modeled by partial least squares regression (PLSR) for predicting water, fat and protein contents yielding a reasonable accuracy with determination coefficients ( R P 2 ) of 0.89, 0.84 and 0.86 concomitant with standard error of prediction (SEP) of 0.46%, 0.65% and 0.29%, respectively. Some image processing algorithms were developed and the most relevant wavelengths were selected to visualize the predicted chemical constituents in each pixel of the hyperspectral image yielding the spatially distributed visualizations of the sample contents. The results were promising and implied that hyperspectral imaging technique associated with appropriate chemometric multivariate analyses has a great potential for simultaneous assessment of various chemical constituents without using hazardous chemical reagents.",

The effect of biocide addition on the material rheological response, its antimicrobial activity and biocide release behaviour have been assessed. Rheological tests demonstrated that formulation and processing may exert a notable effect on the material linear viscoelasticity. Kirby\u2013Bauer tests carried out on four selected types of microorganisms revealed that oregano essential oil into a wheat gluten-based matrix may be suitable for applications where the active agent must be progressively delivered (for up to 7\u00a0days).

Results from the study indicated that microwave technique had a significant stabilization effect on wheat germ. When the on-line processing capacity of wheat germ was 20\u00a0kg/h, the optimal conditions for wheat germ stabilization were microwave power of 4\u00a0kW, the processing time of 8\u00a0min and ventilation rate of 60\u00a0N\u00a0m3/h.

After 60\u00a0days\u2019 accelerated storage, the acid value increased only 6.56% of that of the stabilized wheat germ before storage. In addition, microwave could cause the death of harmful microorganisms. It was clear that the continuous microwave stabilization process was practicable for wheat germ stabilization.",

     "abstract": "An ultrasonic bleaching process for rapeseed oil was studied by monitoring the removal of oil-containing pigments spectrophotometrically at 446\u00a0nm in varied bleaching conditions. When low-power ultrasound was used, bleaching was resulted from pigment adsorption by adsorbents, among which bentonite decreased the A446 the most from 1.82 to 0.65. Ultrasound enhanced the absorption rate rather than the total absorption capacity. When high-power ultrasound was used, bleaching took place even in the absence of adsorbent as evidenced by the decease of A446 to 0.74, possibly due to the effects of combining heat and sonochemical degradation of pigments. The overall bleaching effects were enhanced with the increase of ultrasound power, sonication time and treatment temperature. The content of primary oxidation products in oils increased after sonication, whereas the content of secondary oxidation products remained constant. Due to its multiple mechanisms, ultrasonic bleaching may be a good alternative to the adsorption-based bleaching method.",

     "abstract": "Scraped surface heat exchangers (SSHEs) are widely used for crystallization applications in several food processes (i.e. crystallization of margarine, tempering of chocolate, freezing of ice cream and sorbet). The final quality of these food products is highly related to crystal size distribution and apparent viscosity, both of which are determined by the operating conditions of the process. During the freezing of sorbet, the increase in the ice volume fraction leads to an increase in the apparent viscosity of the product. This effect modifies the fluid flow behavior, the residence time distribution (RTD) and the temperature profile inside the equipment. This work aimed at studying the influence of the operating conditions on the RTD and the axial temperature profile of the product in a SSHE, so as to characterize the product flow behavior. RTD experiments were carried out in a continuous laboratory pilot-scale SSHE by means of a colorimetric method. Experiments showed that high product flow rates led to a narrowing of the RTD and thus to less axial dispersion, due to the enhancement of the radial mixing with the decrease in the apparent viscosity of the product. Spreading of the RTD was obtained for lower refrigerant fluid temperatures, due to a higher radial temperature gradient between the wall and the center of the exchanger, leading to a higher gradient of the apparent viscosity. This effect increased the difference in axial flow velocities and thus the axial dispersion. These results can be useful for the optimization and modelling of crystallization processes in SSHEs.",

Hyperspectral images were acquired by scanning the ham slices (900\u20131700\u00a0nm) originated from different quality grade of turkey hams. Spectral data were then extracted and analyzed using partial least-squares (PLSs) regression, as a multivariate calibration method, to reduce the high dimensionality of the data and to correlate the NIR reflectance spectra with quality attributes of the samples considered. Instead of using a wide range of spectra, the number of wavebands was reduced for more stable, comprehensive and faster model in the subsequent multispectral imaging system. From this point of view, important wavelengths were selected to improve the predictive power of the calibration models as well as to simplify the model by avoiding repetition of information or redundancies.

The aim of this study is to submit and discuss the results of mechanical and rheological characterization of wet agglomerates obtained by wetting cereal powder in low shear mixer. For various conditions of wetting, these properties are obtained thanks to shearing and compression tests led on a powder rheometer (FT4 \u2013 Freeman Technology, UK). The analysis of the mechanical and rheological properties of agglomerates obtained after wet agglomeration process has been carried out thanks to an approach based on soil science and granular media. This approach makes it possible to highlight the great influence of water content on the rheological behavior of the agglomerates bed bulk: its increase results in variations of the friction between grains together with variations in their cohesion. These variations are analyzed regarding the modifications in the population balance induced by the increase in water content. Uniaxial compression tests make it possible to calculate, through three compression models (Kawakita, Hackel and Adams), the agglomerates strength. It is shown that it evolves according to a decreasing power law when water content increases. These results are in accordance with the fractal description of the agglomeration process that support a decrease of the agglomerates solid volume fraction, and thus of their resistance, with water content.",

The inhomogeneity leads to a subfraction depending sedimentation behaviour of the whole granule-fraction in egg yolk which could be clearly classified.

     "abstract": "Whey protein isolate (WPI) films embedded with TiO2@@SiO2 (porous silica (SiO2) coated titania (TiO2)) nanoparticles for improved mechanical properties were prepared by solution casting. A WPI solution of 1.5\u00a0wt% TiO2@@SiO2 nanoparticles was subjected to sonication at amplitudes of 0, 16, 80 and 160\u00a0\u03bcm prior to casting in order to improve the film forming properties of protein and to obtain a uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the WPI films. The physical and mechanical properties of the films were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile testing. Water vapor permeability (WVP) measurements revealed that the water vapor transmission rates are slightly influenced by sonication conditions and nanoparticle loading. The DMA results showed that, at high sonication levels, addition of nanoparticles prevented protein agglomeration. The thermal stability of the materials revealed the presence of 3\u20134 degradation stages in oxidizing the protein films. The addition of nanoparticles strengthens the WPI film, as evidenced by tensile stress analysis. Sonication improved nanoparticle distribution in film matrix; such films can potentially become effective packaging materials to enhance food quality and safety.",

This study was designed to compare the changes of water and salt in salted egg under five pressures and five pulsation frequencies in saturated brine solution (\u2a7e25% NaCl (w/w)). Results showed that moisture content of both egg white and yolk significantly decreased with concomitant increase in salt content compared to traditional pickling. PPOD caused increases in water loss and salt gain of eggs and the optimal pressure and pulsation frequency were 160\u00a0kPa and 7.5\u00a0min/15\u00a0min. Moreover, hardening ratio of egg yolk increased as pickling time and storage time increasing. About 2.92\u201315.63 fold diffusivity was found for the egg under PPOD compared to traditional pickling over the same time period. Environmental Scanning electron microscopic study revealed that yolk granule was aligned closely and became increasingly smaller after pickling.",

     "abstract": "Sulforaphane is one of the most potent food-derived anticarcinogens and is abundantly found in Brassica vegetables, including cabbages. Due to its importance an ability to effectively extract sulforaphane from its source is desirable. This work investigated the feasibility of using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) to extract sulforaphane from cabbages. The effects of various parameters, which are the type of solvent (dichloromethane and water), set microwave power (130, 260 and 390\u00a0W) and extraction time, on the extraction yield of sulforaphane were investigated. In addition, since it was previously shown that partially dried cabbages contain higher sulforaphane content than fresh cabbages, the effect of partial drying prior to MAE on the extractable amount of sulforaphane was investigated. A comparison between MAE and conventional extraction was also made. The results showed that MAE was more effective than the conventional extraction as the former led to higher yield of sulforaphane in a much shorter extraction time. There were no significant differences in the highest extractable sulforaphane contents from the fresh and semi-dried samples. Use of different solvents also did not lead to any significant effect on the MAE of sulforaphane, either from the fresh or semi-dried sample.",

The VE-tongue self-developed in this study comprised six working electrodes (gold, silver, platinum, palladium, tungsten, and titanium electrode), an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a platinum auxiliary electrode. The multi-frequency large amplitude pulse voltammetry (MLAPV) was applied to the working electrodes as the scanning potential waveform,and it consisted of four frequency segments of 1\u00a0Hz, 10\u00a0Hz, 100\u00a0Hz, and 1000\u00a0Hz. In this study, five cultivars of pear from different geographical origins were tested by VE-tongue, and the firmness and sugar content of pears were tested by the traditional methods. The characteristic data (the maximum and minimum values) obtained by VE-tongue were compressed by principal component analysis (PCA), and the principal components (PCs) were taken as the input variables of principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and least squared-support vector machines (LS-SVMs) to predict sugar content and firmness.

Separate experiments confirmed that the probiotic strain metabolizes only d-glucose. Encapsulated LGG formulations (2\u00a0wt.% LGG, dry basis) were prepared by freeze drying a mixture of the freshly cultured bacteria within various whey protein\u2013carbohydrate matrices. The encapsulant matrices used were (i) a 1:2 mixture of protein:maltodextrin, (ii) a 1:1:1 mixture of protein:maltodextrin:d-glucose and (iii) a 1:1:1 mixture of protein:maltodextrin:l-glucose. The partial substitution of maltodextrin with either d-glucose or l-glucose in the encapsulant matrix significantly enhanced the survival of LGG powders stored at a relative humidity of 33% RH and 25\u00a0\u00b0C over 35\u00a0days. In comparison, there was a protective effect afforded by partial substitution of maltodextrin with either stereoisomer of glucose during storage of LGG powders at relative humidity of 70% RH and 25\u00a0\u00b0C over 7\u00a0days only. However, on longer term storage at relative humidity of 70% RH and 25\u00a0\u00b0C over 14\u201335\u00a0days, the viability of LGG was similar for all formulations. The results suggest that the protection afforded to LGG by the incorporation of d-glucose or l-glucose in the encapsulant matrix was primarily due to the physico-chemical effect of the glucose molecules rather than d-glucose being a metabolizable sugar. These experiments allowed discrimination between the physico-chemical and nutritional roles of glucose on LGG viability.",

The effects of the two antioxidants on the optical (color), thermal and mechanical properties of PLLA/starch blends with antioxidants were assessed. PLLA/starch blend films with \u03b1-TOC and resveratrol showed a yellowish color influenced by the combined effect of white starch and the brown color of the antioxidants. The glass transition and melting temperatures were significantly reduced with the addition of antioxidants while enhanced thermal stability was observed, which could be a benefit and important for processing and production. The enhanced mechanical properties could be attributed to not only a compatibilization effect based on the chemical linkage between PLLA and starch chains, but also restriction of the chain mobility by antioxidants. The release of resveratrol from PLLA and PLLA/starch blend films into ethanol followed Fickian behavior.

Digital bread crumbs have been compared against real world samples via visual texture and small strain compression experiments. Digital bread crumbs exhibited similarities to real products in terms of cell wall thicknesses as seen from surface appearance.

A control sample (MS) was prepared by ball-milling without pretreatment. Particle size and shape of micronized starch were investigated, and its application in low fat cream was studied. The Maltase cross of HMS granules almost disappeared and the particle size clearly decreased. It was evident that acid-lintnerised starch granules were more susceptible to break down upon milling. However, the granules would aggregate with an increase in milling time. Compared with full-fat cream, the apparent viscosity of low-fat cream increased, while fat globules partial coalescence rate, overrun and textural properties decreased with the increasing of the fat replacement rate. The average particle size of whipped cream increased with the increase of whipping time. Results indicate that a 15% fat replacement rate would produce cream with good foaming and storage stability.",

In all cases, films were flexible and transparent, regardless of chitosan molecular weight, glycerol content, and temperature. Regarding antimicrobial activity, chitosan film forming solutions showed antimicrobial behaviour against Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum. It was also observed that the bacteriostatic property of chitosan-based films against bacteria employed in this study was notably affected by temperature. Moreover, temperature produced significant variation in the functional properties of chitosan-based films, such as colour, wettability, resistance against UV light and mechanical properties. In good agreement with this behaviour, total soluble matter (TSM), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggested a change in the chemical structure of chitosan films, possibly due to Maillard reaction when heat treatment was used.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate high pressure (HP) treatment for rapid and uniform pH reduction of low acid foods using carrot. Three organic acids (citric, malic and glucono-delta-lactone) were used in the study. Conventional acidification tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure at different temperatures (36\u201348\u00a0\u00b0C) and different treatment times (0\u201336\u00a0min). HP treatments were given at room temperature (maximum process temperature <32\u00a0\u00b0C) with different pressures (200\u2013300\u00a0MPa) and treatment times (0\u201314\u00a0min). Time dependent acid infusion and the resulting pH reduction were used to evaluate the acidification kinetics. Results showed that the pH reduction rates were described by a first order kinetic model. No significant differences (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) in acidification rates were observed between the acidifying agents either in conventional or HP acidification process. Pressure (HP acidification) and temperature (conventional acidification) significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduced decimal reduction time (D) for pH drop. The associated D values were 2.4\u20134.4 times higher in conventional (slower) as compared with HP acidification. For conventional acidification, the z values (temperature sensitivity) were 34\u201344.8\u00a0\u00b0C and for HP acidification, the z values (pressure sensitivity) were 206\u2013222\u00a0MPa.

Results show that skin ground color becomes uncorrelated with flesh color for skin ground color hue angles below 70\u00b0. Cultivar-specific models using nondestructive, log-transformed, interactance measurements at two wavebands in the visible region produced good predictive performance of flesh hue (r\u00a0=\u00a00.92), while a global model required information at five wavebands to achieve this same level of performance (r\u00a0=\u00a00.92 and RMSECV\u00a0=\u00a01.35\u00b0 hue).

This hydration process is approximately ten-fold faster than the traditional soaking procedure, and the microbial load developed by the end of this process is much lower compared to that obtained using the traditional process. This bean hydration process was achieved with a new extraction technique using the Naviglio extractor, which subjected the water containing the beans to cycles of pressurisation in which the pressure values ranged between 0 (atmospheric pressure) and 10\u00a0bar. This innovative hydration process (I) reduced the time required for the complete hydration of the beans to approximately 60\u00a0min and produced a product saturated with the same final amount of moisture as the product obtained from the conventional soaking process (T) that lasts 12\u201320\u00a0h. The numerical simulation of the hydration process (I) has provided useful indications on how the diffusion of humidity inside the beans occurred during the pressurised soaking process. The treated beans were packaged, and organoleptic tests, including taster panel tests, were conducted. Finally, the aromatisation of the legumes was conducted in conjunction with the hydration process to introduce flavouring elements used in some famous traditional recipes for Italian cuisine.",

Starch-based trays in which additives were used showed improved water resistance. The water absorption capacities of the trays were 13%, 14% and 9% when combinations of kaolin/beeswax, fibre/beeswax and fibre/kaolin/beeswax were added, respectively.We found that baked foams formulated with only cross-linked starch had higher tensile and flexural strength than composite foams of either cross-linked starch/kaolin or cross-linked starch/beeswax. However, using combinations of additives further increased the tensile and flexural strength of baked foams, with the exception of cross-linked starch/beeswax/kaolin composite foams.

Two-hundred forty samples (80 for each variety) were selected as sample set. Two-hundred ten pear samples (70 for each variety) were selected randomly for the calibration set, and the remaining 30 samples (10 for each variety) for the validation set. Partial least squares (PLS) and least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) with different spectral preprocessing techniques were implemented for calibration models. Different wavelength regions including Vis, NIR and Vis/NIR were compared. It indicated that Vis/NIR (400\u20131800\u00a0nm) was optimal for PLS and LS-SVM models. Then, LS-SVM models were developed with a grid search technique and RBF kernel function. All LS-SVM models outperformed PLS models. Next, effective wavelengths (EWs) were selected according to regression coefficients. The EW-LS-SVM models were developed and a good prediction precision and stability was achieved compared with PLS and LV-LS-SVM models. The correlation coefficient of prediction (rp), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and bias for the best prediction by EW-LS-SVM were 0.9164, 0.2506 and \u22120.0476 for SSC, 0.8809, 0.0579 and \u22120.0025 for pH, whereas 0.8912, 0.6247 and \u22120.2713 for firmness, respectively. The overall results indicated that the regression coefficient was an effective way for the selection of effective wavelengths. LS-SVM was superior to the conventional linear PLS method in predicting SSC, pH and firmness in pears. Therefore, non-linear models may be a better alternative to monitor internal quality of fruits. And the EW-LS-SVM could be very helpful for development of portable instrument or real-time monitoring of the quality of pears.",

This work develops an active package designed for the preservation of fresh farmed salmon in cubes or slices, made up of a rigid polypropylene (PP)/ethylene\u2013vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH)/PP tray heat-sealed with an active PP/EVOH/PP film lid in which 6.5% carvacrol is incorporated in the EVOH kernel as an antimicrobial active agent.

The results obtained from the determination of parameters showed a rapid migration of the active compound through the fish muscle, and a low affinity of the agent molecules for the food matrix.

The objective of the study is to develop simple tools to help industrials understand, and then optimise their fabrication process. Residence Time Distribution (RTD) has been characterised in an industrial pilot system during real ice cream production, after the method had been validated in an experimental set-up with a simple mixture of water and sucrose. It has been shown that in its dimensionless form, RTD depend slightly on flow rate and scraper rotational speed. A simple model of flow pattern applicable to SSHE during crystallisation was developed to reproduce the observed RTD. It distinguishes two zones: the volume of fluid near the cooling wall where ice is generated and which is swept by the blades and the volume of fluid near to the rotor. Therefore, the model considers two parallel plug flow reactors with axial dispersion, and which exchange fluid by radial mixing. After adjustment of the model parameters, a good agreement was obtained with experimental results. The flow rate is lower in the zone near the cooling wall; this can be due to a higher ice concentration leading to higher viscosity. This approach can contribute to better understand, optimise and control SSHE used for ice cream production.",

The heat transfer model considered conduction as the governing equation, subject to convection, radiation and moisture evaporation boundary conditions. A 3D finite element algorithm developed in Java\u2122 was used to solve the model. The algorithm generated solutions for meshes containing 4-node tetrahedral volume elements and 3-node triangular boundary elements. Product geometries were generated from CT-scan images of the meat products. The model was adapted to receive input parameters that can be easily provided by a meat processors including air relative humidity, air temperature, air velocity, type of casing, duration of water shower, product weight, and estimated core temperature of product prior to entering the cooling chamber. Model validation was conducted in four commercial facilities, under normal processing conditions. Temperatures predicted by the model were in agreement with observed values. Average root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 1.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54\u00a0\u00b0C for core temperatures, 1.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48\u00a0\u00b0C for temperatures 0.05\u00a0m from core to surface, and 2.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.01\u00a0\u00b0C for surface temperatures.

     "abstract": "The teratogenic and carcinogenic effects of phthalate esters on living beings are proven in toxicology studies. These ubiquitous food and environmental pollutants pose a great danger to the human race due to their extraordinary use as a plasticizer in the consumer product industry. Contemporary detection techniques used for phthalates require a high level of skills, expensive equipment and longer analysis time than the presented technique. Presented research work introduces a real time non-invasive detection technique using a new type of silicon substrate based planar interdigital (ID) sensor fabricated on basis of thin film micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) semiconductor device fabrication technology. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used in conjunction with the fabricated sensor to detect phthalates in deionized water. Various concentrations of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) as low as 2\u00a0ppb to a higher level of 2\u00a0ppm in deionized water were detected distinctively using new planar ID sensor based EIS sensing system. Dip testing method was used to obtain the conductance and dielectric properties of the bulk samples. Parylene C polymer coating was used as a passivation layer on the surface of the fabricated sensor to reduce the influence of Faradaic currents. In addition, inherent dielectric properties of the coating enhanced the sensitivity of the capacitive type sensor. Electrochemical spectrum analysis algorithm was used to model experimentally observed impedance spectrum to deduce constant phase element (CPE) equivalent circuit to analyse the kinetic processes taking place inside the electrochemical cell. Curve fitting technique was used to extract the values of the circuit components and explain experimental results on theoretical grounds. The sensor performance was tested by adding DEHP to an energy drink at concentrations above and below the minimal risk level (MRL) limit set by the ATSDR (Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry), USA. Results showed that the new sensor was able to detect different concentrations of phthalates in energy drinks. The experimental outcomes provided sufficient indication to favour the development of a low cost detection system for rapid quantification of phthalates in beverages for industrial use.",

Thermal contact resistance was incorporated in the models to account for the thermal resistance due to the micro-gaps existed on film surfaces and the heat sink effect of the contaminant liquid. The heat transfer models were validated by using experimental film\u2013film interface temperature data when upper jaw temperatures of 155 and 165\u00a0\u00b0C were applied. The models predicted the film\u2013film interface temperatures well with root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranging from 1.6 to 2.1\u00a0\u00b0C for clean seals, and from 1.6 to 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C for water-contaminated seals.

The 6%\u00a0w/w of composite film based on shellac and gelatin was prepared by the incorporation of different concentrations of gelatin and was prepared by film casting method. The stability of the composite films was then studied at 40\u00a0\u00b0C, 75% RH for 180\u00a0days in a stability chamber and the physicochemical properties were investigated. The results demonstrated that the higher concentrations of gelatin (30%, 40% and 50%) contributed to slight change in the acid value and the percentage of insoluble solids upon 180\u00a0days of storage. These results were due to the protection at the active sites of the shellac, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, by the electrostatic interaction between the negative charge of shellac and the positive charge of gelatin, resulting in the stabilized shellac. However, the mechanical properties could not withstand the storage time; further investigation was required to improve the stability in terms of mechanical properties of the composite film by the addition of a plasticizer. Two types of plasticizers were used: polyethylene glycol (PEG) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) represented hydrophilic and hydrophobic plasticizers at the concentrations of 5% and 10%, respectively. The addition of both types and concentrations of plasticizers could improve the poor mechanical properties and brittleness of the composite film for a longer storage time. However, only PEG 400 at 5% and 10%\u00a0w/w acted as a good plasticizer capable of improving the stability of the composite film under the longer periods of storage. Therefore, the attempt to improve the stability in terms of polymerization and mechanical properties of shellac by the formation of the composite film and the addition of the plasticizer could be achieved. The result could be used to develop a new material for the various applications of edible films for coating in food and pharmaceutical industries.",

The resultant edible film prepared with 6\u00a0g/100\u00a0g sodium caseinate and 2\u00a0g/100\u00a0g stearic acid showed the lowest WVP of 1.368\u00a0(g\u00a0mm/m2\u00a0h\u00a0kPa).",

The bleached oils were evaluated for free fatty acids, peroxide value, p-anisidine value, totox, oxidation stability (Rancimat) and color (CIELAB coordinates).

This versatile technology has been used to encapsulate a wide array of products such as pharmaceuticals, flavors, volatile oils, plant extracts, enzymes and others. In the recent decades, this technology has also been applied to the area of microbial cell immobilization owing to its numerous advantages over other cell immobilization techniques such as higher cell loading capacity, enhanced cell survival and increased production rate of the desired microbial products. The confinement of microbial cells within a semipermeable polymeric matrix enables the physical isolation of cells from the external environment while maintaining a hospitable internal micro-environment. It has found application in various biotechnological processes such as probiotic encapsulation in food industries, in biotransformation and fermentation processes producing antibiotics, organic acids, enzymes, and alcohols as well as environmental decontamination such as waste water treatment. The judicious selection of materials and methods for the production of microspheres is critical for ensuring minimum damage to the viability of the encapsulated microbial cells. The conventional methods used for microencapsulation of microbial cells are reviewed along with the recent advances in the respective methods. The effect of microencapsulation on the microbial cells, the stability of the microspheres as well as the techniques for enumeration of the encapsulated cells are also discussed, followed by a summary of recent applications of microencapsulation in different biotechnological processes.",

     "abstract": "During processing of a food, its temperature, moisture and other compositions, structure, etc., can change, continuously changing its physical properties. Realistic simulation of food processes require dynamic estimation of the food physical properties as they continue to change during the process. Having a few data points for a few states of the material, as is true for the majority of food properties data, is not sufficient for realistic process simulations. The goal of this article is a practical one: it is to develop a concise resource for the equations that can estimate food properties as they change during processing. Such a resource should make computer-aided food product, process and equipment design one step closer to reality by making the necessary input parameters available in one location and in a format that can be readily used in a simulation software. Several equilibrium, transport and electrical properties are included. The estimation equations for any property are chosen from among the most successful and accurate, staying away from property estimators that have theoretical basis but have not been as successful for food materials. For each property, implementation of its prediction equations in a computer model has also been discussed. Accuracy of each property estimation process have been included from the literature, showing most properties can be estimated to within 10% accuracy, sufficient for modeling purposes. Having such reasonable prediction models has the important implication that unavailability of sufficient data, that is expected to be always true due to the variety and complexity of food materials and processes, is not a bottleneck for computer-aided food process engineering.",

Classification of control and chill-injured samples in ripe fruits measured at 660\u00a0nm and 785\u00a0nm resulted in misclassification error as low as 6% and 8% for early detection, and 0.67% and 1.33% for detection after storage, respectively.

Temperature effects on both shrinkage kinetics and total diameter reduction were found to be different from low solids milk drying. A high drying temperature at 110\u00a0\u00b0C led to negligible droplet shrinkage at X range between 1 and 0.3\u00a0kg/kg. An increase in temperature resulted in larger particles after drying. The high initial solids could sustain the droplet shape and hinder solute diffusion; as such droplet shrinkage behaviour deviates from the description of ideal shrinkage kinetics.

The velocity of the cork popping out of the bottleneck was also measured, and found to logically increase with the champagne temperature. By considering that gases under pressure in the bottleneck experience adiabatic expansion while cork popping, a thermodynamic model was built that accounts for the major physical parameters that influence the volume of gaseous CO2 gushing out of the bottleneck, its drop of temperature, and its total energy released while cork popping.

Having accurate and multidimensional knowledge of the milk solution at different stages of the process is crucial in order to maintain satisfactory control of the process. Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) is a novel, robust and high speed method of process imaging. It has the potential to overcome the lack of online concentration sensors and provide multidimensional concentration information at various stages of the milk powder production process. In order to achieve this goal an accurate model is required to correlate the ERT\u2019s multidimensional conductivity measurements to milk concentration/total solids content.This work focuses on obtaining a correlation of milk conductivity, temperature and composition (including powder protein, lactose and fat content on a dry basis) to the total solids content for whole and skim milk in the process to produce milk powder.

The resulting Response Surface, correlating the factors to whole and skim milk concentration, provided an accuracy of over 93%.

Multiple linear regression models presented better accuracy for lower concentrations while the CCD model presented better accuracy for higher concentrations.",

     "abstract": "The effect of different cocoa composition of dark chocolate samples and their ingredients on their thermal, structural and rheological characteristics was investigated. Thermal behavior was evaluated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while the crystal morphology was observed by polarized light optical microscopy. The rheological measurements were carried out using both continuous and oscillatory experiments. The formation of more stable polymorphic structures was time and temperature dependent; and it was not affected by either cocoa composition or particle sizes. The kinetics of crystallization was determined by a step crystallization method and modeled by the Avrami equation, it was accelerated by solid particles concentration, lower particle size and lower crystallization temperatures. Negative spherulites with featherlike microstructures defined the time dependent crystal growth and were consistent with Avrami indexes of 3\u20134. Under continuous shear, cocoa butter was well described by the Bingham rheological model, while Casson and Carreau equations modeled the flow of cocoa liquor and chocolate samples. However the Carreau model was preferred for presenting better fittings and for predicting apparent viscosities at low and at high shear rates. From both, continuous and oscillatory experiments, it was found that composition of chocolate samples in terms of fat and nonfat cocoa solids, and sugar content, affected their rheological behavior. The solid liquid transition of chocolate samples and cocoa liquor was obtained at a yield stress of around 1\u00a0Pa from both continuous and oscillatory shear experiments.",

     "abstract": "Formation of oil droplets during twin screw extrusion processing of maize starch was investigated by analyzing the droplet breakup and coalescence mechanisms separately. For this purpose, the flow was characterized by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using material data derived from online rheological measurements. The simulated results on local flow conditions were coupled to experimental data on the dispersed phase morphology, which was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This was used to elucidate the influence of process characteristics relevant for droplet breakup and coalescence. The results showed that increasing screw speed does not necessarily result in smaller droplet sizes. This could be related to the contradictory effects: increasing screw speed improves droplet breakup but also increases the rate of coalescence. Smaller droplet sizes were obtained at higher blend viscosities, which could be achieved either by increasing the feed rate or by using screw configuration that applies less mechanical stress. The results suggest that an increase in blend viscosity reduced the rate of coalescence. Moreover, increasing oil content led to an increased rate of coalescence, and therefore to remarkably bigger droplets. Selection of process parameters (e.g. screw configuration, feed rate, screw speed) based on the findings of this study allowed enhancing the dispersive mixing efficiency of triglyceride droplets during extrusion processing of maize starch.",

The degradation of trans-iso-\u03b1-acids in elaborated pale lager beers followed first order reaction and this degradation conforms to the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy (Ea) and frequency factor (A) for trans-iso-\u03b1-acids in elaborated pale lager beer ranged from 69.2\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 and 1.88\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010\u00a0days\u22121 for trans-isocohumulone to 74.4\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 and 1.3642\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01011\u00a0days\u22121 for trans-isoadhumulone. The higher value of Ea demonstrated greater temperature sensitivity of trans-iso-\u03b1-acids during accelerated storage.

Even at low temperature fluctuations of ambient air, condensation on relevant surfaces can be observed due to comparatively high air humidity inside the film packaging. The objective of the present study was to determine condensation dynamics and intensity within plastic film packaging for fruit under changing environmental conditions. Using packages of plums as a test case, it could be shown that water condensation processes occur time-delayed and superimposed with varying intensities on the surface of the fruit, on the inner film surface, and on the inner tray walls. Retention time and intensity of condensation were identified as the substantial components of condensation. In addition to the external temperature cycle the external mass transfer and the air volume within the packaging were taken into consideration. The condensation on the inner film surface was especially influenced by the flow conditions, the external temperature amplitude and the inner air volume. In contrast, condensation processes on fruit surfaces were caused primarily by temperature amplitude and cycle time.",

Each of the powders was compacted at a punch speed of 5\u00a0mm/min to final compaction pressures in the range of 26\u2013230\u00a0MPa, in a 13\u00a0mm diameter cylindrical die.

The force relaxation data was fit to linear Maxwell model for a viscoelastic solid (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.99) and the viscoelastic properties of the pure solid material were estimated by extrapolating to zero compact porosity. Although density of compacts from either powder was found to be comparable, SPC produced much stronger compacts compared to SF due to higher bonding. The estimated compact density under pressure was found to be much higher than the pycnometer measured true densities. The contact area between two particles was estimated using Lum and Duncan-Hewitt (1999) using median particle size, pressure\u2013time during compaction and material viscoelastic properties. Power law and logarithmic models that express the compact density and tensile strength respectively as a function of total viscoelastic contact area in a compact were successfully developed (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.95\u20130.99).

Seventeen samples of different EVOO with a moisture content ranging from 178 to 1321\u00a0mg/kg oil were selected for study.

Subsequently, the capacitance of all 17 EVOO samples was measured at selected frequencies.Water content and capacitance for filtered oil were linearly correlated, showing R2 values up to 0.959 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 48\u00a0mg/kg oil at 2\u00a0kHz. When the main oil composition together with the moisture changed, the trend was always linear, but the correlation (R2) decreased to 0.818 with an RMSE value of 123\u00a0mg/kg oil (at 8\u00a0kHz), so that the system remains suitable for screening of water content.

Maltodextrin (MD) was mixed with gum Arabic (GA), whey protein concentrate (WPC) or two types of modified starch (Hi-Cap 100TM and Capsul TA\u00ae) at a 25:75 ratio. The feed emulsions used for particle production were characterized for stability, viscosity and droplet size. The best encapsulation efficiency was obtained for MD:Hi-Cap followed by the MD:Capsul combination, while the lowest encapsulation efficiency was obtained for MD:WPC, which also showed poorer emulsion stability. Particles were hollow, with the active material embedded in the wall material matrix, and had no apparent cracks or fissures. During the oxidative stability study, MD:WPC combination was the wall material that best protected the active material against lipid oxidation.",

Maltodextrin DE 12 leading to more viscous aqueous phases was found to be more efficient for the production of finer emulsions. Whatever the composition, no oil oxidation was observed after processing and after 2\u00a0weeks storage. After 3\u00a0weeks, coarse emulsions presented two phases whilst the submicron ones were stable after more than 2\u00a0months.",

The present study reports the rheological characteristics of native Aloe gel and juice under dynamic and steady shear. The damping of the elastic moduli and viscous moduli at various temperatures for the Aloe gel under oscillatory shear tests have been reported, for the first time, which were observed due to the presence of weak, fibrous and random structure of polysaccharides in it. The moduli for gel increased with increasing temperature and that for juice decreased with temperature. Prior to attaining the plateau region after certain shear rate, Aloe vera gel and juice exhibited shear thinning behavior. The flow behavior index for Aloe gel samples was found to be 0.1 in the shear thinning region.",

     "abstract": "A CO2 hydrate dessert is a carbonated frozen dessert in which CO2 hydrates replace some or all of the ice. When a CO2 hydrate dessert is eaten, CO2 perception is very strong due to formation and bursting of bubbles in the mouth as well as dissolution of CO2 leading to nociceptor stimulation. A preliminary sensory panel indicated that a CO2 hydrate dessert could be perceived as more carbonated than a freshly opened soda. However, it was also found that a CO2 hydrate dessert must have a significantly higher CO2 concentration than is typical in carbonated beverages (including champagne), just to have moderate perception of carbonation. In this work, heat transfer limited and mass transfer limited models for CO2 hydrate dissociation are compared and the implications for CO2 perception are discussed. It is suggested that the mass transfer limited model is most applicable to the case of eating CO2 hydrate desserts. According to this model, a thin ice shell limits the rate of CO2 hydrate dissociation. After dissociation, CO2 gas is dissolved in the available aqueous phase. In a CO2 hydrate there is much more CO2 present than could be dissolved in the water that is present, so a large fraction of the CO2 in the dessert may be lost with the breath of the consumer.",

     "abstract": "The removal of acrylamide from coffee through supercritical CO2 extraction has been investigated for the first time. Two steps were performed: a pre-roasting treatment and a supercritical extraction process. The main aim of this first work was to investigate the feasibility of the process more than the impact of the treatment on the organoleptic properties of coffee. The efficiency of acrylamide removal was checked by measuring its content in the coffee beans before and after the supercritical treatment. The role of temperature, pressure, extraction time and the addition of a modifier (ethanol) was examined.The supercritical treatment did not affect the caffeine content of coffee and a maximum extraction efficiency of 79% was found for acrylamide. While a pressure variation did not significantly affect the results, temperature affected the extraction process at the highest extent. The addition of ethanol resulted in a significant increase in the extraction performance due to the change in polarity of the supercritical solvent mixture. The best working conditions in the experimental range here investigated were 100\u00a0\u00b0C, 200\u00a0bar and 9.5% w/w ethanol.",

The present research was aimed at developing a new sodium-carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) matrix by spray-drying to microencapsulate soy extracts obtaining enhanced technological and permeation properties. Microparticles (NaCMC-Iso) loaded with marketed soybeans extract (Iso), enriched in daidzein and genistein (about 90% w/w), were produced. Different liquid feeds, based on H2O/EtOH/acetone co-solvent systems, and various process parameters were tested to obtain a free-flowing and manageable powder with satisfying yield. The engineered NaCMC-Iso powders showed satisfying loading efficiency, high flow properties, good stability and enhanced technological properties. Interestingly, the in vitro dissolution and permeation rates were dramatically improved suggesting a higher bioavailability after the oral administration. The made-up powder appears a newsworthy ingredient of easier manipulation for enclosing in dietary supplements and nutraceutical products.",

     "abstract": "A system for on-line sorting of meat trimmings into categories with different fat levels was developed and tested by simulations and pilot-plant trials. The system consists of a conveyor belt, a NIR imaging scanner (QV500, Tomra Sorting Solutions, Asker, Norway), a flow weigher and grader (both Marel hf, Iceland) and a host computer containing synchronising software and a sorting algorithm. The sorting algorithm is based on desirability functions, which makes it flexible when it comes to selecting number of categories, target values, limits for deviations and other restrictions. The results showed that the sorting algorithm works when the fat measurements are accurate, giving deviations from target lower than the selected \u00b11 percentage point limits. In reality there are some inaccuracies in the on-line fat measurements due to inhomogeneous meat trimmings. This leads to a systematic under-estimation of the fat percentage in low-fat categories and over-estimation in the high-fat categories. These biases can be reduced by e.g. improving the on-line fat measurement technology. However, simulations showed that the bias for either category was generally low (below 2 percentage points) and the current system therefore has potential for on-line implementation.",

     "abstract": "The effect of heteroaggregation of oppositely charged protein microspheres dispersed within a liquid oil phase on the microstructure and rheological properties of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions was evaluated. The aqueous phase of the initial W/O emulsions contained either 10% \u03b2-lactoglobulin or 10% lactoferrin (pH 7, 100\u00a0mM NaCl). At this pH, \u03b2-lactoglobulin (BLG) is negatively charged while lactoferrin (LF) is positively charged. The oil phase consisted of a lipophilic non-ionic surfactant (8% polyglycerol polyricinoleate, PGPR) dispersed within soybean oil. Three 40% W/O emulsions were formed containing different types of protein microspheres: (i) BLG: 100% BLG droplets; (ii) LF: 100% LF droplets; and (iii) Mixed: 50% BLG droplets and 50% LF droplets. Prior to heating, the mixed emulsions had a higher shear viscosity, yield stress, and shear modulus than the BLG or LF emulsions, which suggested that electrostatic attraction led to the formation of a three-dimensional network of aggregated droplets. All three W/O emulsions underwent an irreversible fluid-to-solid transition when they were heated above \u224870\u00a0\u00b0C. This phenomenon was attributed to thermal denaturation of the globular BLG and LF molecules within the aqueous phase promoting aggregation and network formation of the protein microspheres. After heating, the mixed emulsions had a higher shear viscosity, yield stress and shear modulus than the BLG or LF emulsions, suggesting that a stronger droplet network was formed due to electrostatic attraction. Shear rheology measurements of the W/O emulsions showed that the lipid phases formed after heating were non-ideal plastics characterized by a yield stress and shear thinning behavior. These results may facilitate the design of semi-solid or solid foods with reduced saturated- or trans-fat contents suitable for use in commercial products.",

     "abstract": "Current practices in testing flours call for measuring dough strength, not elasticity. Sheeting is a common method for processing developed doughs, the elasticity of which governs dough\u2019s sheetability as dough springs back exiting rollers. To characterise dough sheetability, a study was conducted testing 18 different doughs made from six different flours. Each dough was sheeted using an instrumented sheeter and data for exit sheet thickness and roll forces were captured under a range of sheeting conditions. The true rheological properties of doughs were measured and used to calibrate the ABBM constitutive model for dough (1). Numerical simulations of sheeting operations were conducted; the R2 coefficients between measured and predicted sheet thicknesses and roll forces (vertical and horizontal) were nearly all >0.9. Relaxation times were derived from dough model parameters and revealed that flour quality for dough elasticity should be assessed by examining moisture effects on dough relaxation time.",

     "abstract": "The effect of ultrasound irradiation, as a novel method, on the enhancement of convective heat transfer between a stationary copper sphere and cooling medium was experimentally studied at different Re and Pr numbers. The high thermal conductivity of copper allowed the application of lumped system analysis which led to more accurate results on convective heat transfer. The ultrasonic cooling system included a refrigerated circulator, a flow meter, an ultrasound generator (25\u00a0kHz) and an ultrasonic bath. The studied parameters were sphere diameter (0.01 or 0.02\u00a0m), flow rate (1.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125, 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0m3\u00a0s\u22121), fluid temperature (0, \u22125, \u221210, \u221215 and \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C) and ultrasound intensity (0, 190, 890 and 2800\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122), leading to Re range of 0.98\u20133.4 and Pr range of 68.3\u2013188.9. The Nu number varied from 6.8 to 19 for non-irradiated samples. When ultrasound was irradiated (890\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122) the range of Nu number increased to 11\u201331. Enhancement factors from 30% to 119% were observed for the irradiated samples. The largest values of the enhancement factor were observed for low values of Re and Pr which demonstrated a better efficiency of ultrasound irradiation at higher viscosities and lower flow rates as a result of its mixing and cavitation effects. The results obtained in this study confirmed that ultrasound irradiation is able to enhance the convective heat transfer rate between the cooling medium and the submerged object. Irradiation effect was independent of sphere diameter and a linear relationship was detected between the ultrasound intensity and the Nu number. A correlation was suggested to predict the values of Nu at the presence or absence of ultrasound for different Re and Pr values with good agreement with the experimental data (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.90). The obtained data for copper can be generalized for food products with similar geometries and can be used for process design, as the convective heat transfer is mostly controlled by the cooling medium.",

     "abstract": "A significant number of models allowing the calculation of water activity (aw) in aqueous solutions of electrolytes or of organic substances was proposed and verified experimentally in the last few decades. In case of a mixture of organic and inorganic solutes the lowering of water activity with respect to corresponding single solutes was often observed but, to the best of our knowledge, did not find sound physical explanation yet. Present work proposes a thermodynamic model covering wide range of solution concentrations and applicable to multiple solutes, in particular to the mixtures of high total solid contents, situation relevant to powder caking. Deliquescence lowering is evidenced by means of qualitative visual observation and quantitative measurements of water uptake. Excellent agreement between the measured values of aw for different compositions of NaCl\u2013sucrose\u2013water mixtures and the model calculation of the water activity at any composition is obtained. A diagram relating water activity to the composition of a ternary system is proposed. It facilitates foreseeing the conditions of ambient relative humidity where partial or total dissolution of mixtures of NaCl and sucrose will take place. In addition, it furnishes a better understanding of deliquescence lowering reported in the earlier works.",

Microbiological considerations require the cheese to be cooled to 4\u00a0\u00b0C or less prior to packaging. Knowledge of the temperature evolution of the product is desirable from a manufacturing perspective, and we propose a model to describe the temperature time-history of a single cheese cylinder during cooling. The combination of unusual product geometry and the discontinuity in surface temperatures motivate the use of the finite element method (FEM). The FEM solution is used to describe the cooling process, and to ascertain the minimum time necessary for the cheese to attain the required packaging temperature. The FEM solution exhibits excellent agreement with the corresponding experimental findings. The discontinuity in surface temperatures has a significant influence on the cooling regime. Future process optimisation should focus on developing methods to increase the cheese surface area in contact with the brine.",

     "abstract": "Unbiased internal quality classification of Chestnuts (Castanea spp.) is extremely important to the fresh and processed industries. It can also be used as a tool for applied scientific studies, such as the training of non-invasive techniques to determine chestnut internal quality, and the effect of pre- and post-harvest treatments. At the moment, humans visually perform the invasive quality assessment of chestnuts. This procedure is prone to errors and high variability due to individuals\u2019 fatigue, lack of training, and subjectivity. Thus, there is a need to develop a technique that is able to objectively classify internal quality of chestnuts. In this paper, a computer vision methodology is proposed to sort chestnuts into five classes, as established by an expert human rater. 1790 color images from slices with different quality classes were acquired, using a flat panel scanner, from the hybrid cultivar \u2018Colossal\u2019 and \u2018Chinese seedlings\u2019. After preprocessing, a total of 1931 color, textural, and geometric features were extracted from each color image. Furthermore, the most relevant features were selected using a sequential forward selection algorithm. Thirty-six features were found to be effective in designing a quadratic discriminant classifier with a cross-validated overall performance accuracy of 89.6%. These results showed that this method is an accurate, reliable, and objective tool to determine chestnut slice quality, and might be applicable to in-line sorting systems.",

A comparison between helium pycnometry and X-ray microtomography was carried out and confirmed the quality of analysis in 3-D. Porosity profiles were determined in the interface crust/crumb and showed higher porosity and lower density of the upper crust when increasing heating rate and baking with steaming. The porosity profile of the whole slice bread showed differences between breads baked at 220\u00a0\u00b0C and 240\u00a0\u00b0C; that can be explained by the non uniformity in local expansion during baking resulting in different areas of variable density. Higher density was found in the bottom of the slice due to compression forces during baking. However, the upper zone of the slice was more porous, in relation with the expansion. These differences influence the texture and led to different kinetics of staling. Results of tortuosity confirm that the relative path length is shorter along the height related to the expansion of the bread during baking. Additionally, the relative path length through the pores is shorter when baking at 240\u00a0\u00b0C than when baking at 220\u00a0\u00b0C, in relation with porosity.",

Isolated cells previously dehydrated in 35% and 25% sucrose solutions were rehydrated in 5% sucrose under the microscope with the aim of analyzing the phenomena that take place during rehydration. Cells response to rehydration was found to be more heterogeneous than their response to hypertonic treatments. Cells showed different degrees of delay in their response, which was related to differences in the formation and preservation of membrane-to-wall connections. Results confirmed that rehydration success is based on the preservation of the structures along both, dehydration and rehydration treatments. During swelling, Hechtian strands are reincorporated to the protoplast as far as they are formed and preserved during dehydration and rehydration; their absence or shortage leading to a loss of rehydration capacity or even membrane lysis. Different stages have been identified during rehydration, mass transfer being coupled with deformation\u2013relaxation phenomena once the protoplast reaches the cell wall. Phenomenological coefficients for water transfer indicated that rehydration kinetics is faster than water transfer during dehydration.",

In order to explain the dependence of the mass transfer rate on these variables two novel mathematical models were proposed. It was determined that both, salt gain and water loss rate constants depend on initial lipid content, whereas temperature only affects constants for salt transfer. In addition, salt gain constants depend linearly with initial lipid content and inversely with brining temperature. On the other hand, water loss rate constant was a function of the initial lipid content, fitting to a quadratic equation.",

The heat transfer coefficient results slightly higher during cooling than during heating and increases much more with blades rotational speed than with mass flow rate. Dimensional analysis provides a correlation among heat transfer coefficient, fluid properties and easily measurable flow parameters.

The transglutaminase treatment increased the pasting viscosities of wheat flour whereas viscozyme distinctly reduced these properties. The batters treated with transglutaminase exhibited the highest steady-shear viscosity, followed by the control and viscozyme-treated samples. Dynamic viscoelastic results showed that transglutaminase improved the elastic properties of frying batters, while their viscous characteristics became more dominant when viscozyme was used. These rheological features were favorably correlated with the adhesive properties of batters. During frying, the moisture loss of frying batters was retarded by transglutaminase.

The PEF experiments were done under non-isothermal conditions with temperature increase owing to the effect of ohmic heating. The linear temperature dependencies of electrical conductivity of potato tissue with different values of the electrical conductivity disintegration index, Z, were observed. However, the values of the conductivity temperature coefficient, \u03b1, at the reference temperature Tr\u00a0=\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C were noticeably different for the intact (\u03b1i\u00a0=\u00a00.0255\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0003\u00a0\u00b0C\u22121) and completely damaged (\u03b1d\u00a0=\u00a00.031\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009\u00a0\u00b0C\u22121) potato tissues. This difference was explained by the impact of temperature on the structure of the damaged tissue. The non-isothermal PEF treatment was shown to be an effective tool for electroporation at low temperatures (below ambient). For initial temperature Ti\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C, the most power saving was the PEF treatment at E\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0V/cm (W\u00a0\u2248\u00a020\u201330\u00a0kJ/kg), and the PEF treatment at E\u00a0=\u00a0400\u2013800\u00a0V/cm required more power consumption (W\u00a0\u2248\u00a050\u201380\u00a0kJ/kg). The PEF treatment at the fixed value of E (=400\u00a0V/cm) showed that the total power consumptions (accounting for PEF treatment and thermal heating), required for high level of tissue disintegration, Z\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.9, were comparable for initial temperatures Ti\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C (W\u00a0\u2248\u00a050\u201380\u00a0kJ/kg) and Ti\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C (W\u00a0\u2248\u00a080\u00a0kJ/kg) and were noticeably higher for initial temperature Ti\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C (W\u00a0\u2248\u00a0150\u00a0kJ/kg).",

     "abstract": "Clarification is the first step of inulin production from chicory juice, and membrane filtration as an alternative can greatly simplify this process, increase juice yield, improve product quality, and reduce the cost and waste volume. In this study, a rotating disk module (RDM) was used to investigate the clarification of chicory juice by four micro- and ultrafiltration membranes. Compared with dead end filtration, the RDM had a much higher permeate flux and product quality. High rotating speeds produced high permeate fluxes and reduced flux decline, because of the strong back transport of foulant from fouling layer to feed solution. At high rotating speeds of 1500\u20132000\u00a0rpm, the permeate flux increased with membrane pore size and transmembrane pressure (TMP), while at low rotating speeds (<1000\u00a0rpm), permeate flux was independent of membrane type and TMP due to a thick deposited fouling layer as a dominant filtration resistance, while carbohydrate transmission decreased at higher TMP because of denser cake layer as an additional selective membrane. The highest carbohydrate transmission (\u223c98%) and desirable permeate turbidity (2.4\u00a0NTU) was obtained at a TMP of 75\u00a0kPa and a rotating speed of 2000\u00a0rpm for FSM0.45PP membrane. With the RDM, the Volume Reduction Ratio (VRR) could reach 10 with a high permeate flux (106\u00a0L\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121) in the concentration test, and permeate was still rich in carbohydrate and well clarified. Chemical cleaning with 0.5% P3-ultrasil 10 detergent solution was able to recover 90% water flux of fouled membrane.",

     "abstract": "Two important factors affecting the oil uptake in foods during deep fat frying are water content and pressure development. In the past frying studies, the physical pressure has not been measured experimentally but was calculated using computer models, which has resulted in disagreements about its magnitude. The present study tries to explain the complex mass transfer mechanisms taking place during deep fat frying with respect to real time pressure variations inside potato discs and chicken nuggets. Frying experiments were performed at two temperatures of 175\u00a0\u00b0C and 190\u00a0\u00b0C for 200 and 240\u00a0s for potato discs and chicken nuggets, respectively. The gage pressure increased rapidly above the atmospheric pressure immediately after the samples were introduced into the hot oil. The rise in pressure was greater in potato discs with greater initial moisture content. This was expected due to sudden moisture flash-off. As frying progressed, the temperature inside the samples increased whereas the gage pressure started decreasing and became negative. The onset of negative pressure was observed during initial stages of frying for chicken nuggets, but in the middle of frying for potato discs. The negative pressure values before the product is taken outside the fryer may cause increased oil uptake during frying itself. During the post frying cooling, the pressure further decreased and reached negative values. The negative pressure is expected to have caused rapid absorption of surface oil during both frying and cooling stages.",

This method also enables to take (1) uncertainties pertaining to the system; (2) the confidence level on the different sources of information into account. The aim is to be able to enrich the model each time a new piece of information is available whatever its source and format in order to improve the representation and thus provide a better understanding of systems.

Sequential heating (70\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C) then oxidation (0.1\u00a0mM FeCl3/1\u00a0mM ascorbate/0\u201320\u00a0mM H2O2) (H\u00a0\u2192\u00a0O) or vice versa (O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0H) were conducted to oxidize/unfold WPI at pH 6.8 and 8.0 before casting. The resulting films were characterized through mechanical, microstructural, and protein electrophoretic analyses. Oxidation promoted protein cross-linking mainly through disulfide bonds. Tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) of films decreased for WPI oxidized by higher concentrations of H2O2. Film solubility (protein leachability) at pH 3\u20137, ranging from 20 to 40%, was unaffected by H2O2 up to 5\u00a0mM but reached almost 100% at above 5\u00a0mM H2O2 except at pH 4\u20135. \u03b2-Lactoglobulin dimers and its complex with \u03b1-lactalbumin were abundant in O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0H WPI films and polymers of WPI dominated in H\u00a0\u2192\u00a0O films.

     "abstract": "A piezoelectric element has been used in an acoustic vibration method for measuring food texture. While it is inserted into a food sample, the piezoelectric element detects the vibration of a probe. The frequency response of the piezoelectric sensor used for the acoustic vibration method was evaluated with a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The output voltage from the piezoelectric sensor, which was driven to vibrate at 23 different frequencies, was monitored and compared with the velocity signal obtained by the LDV. The output signal was substantially affected by the vibration frequencies. The output signals corresponded to displacement of the probe below 3\u00a0Hz, to velocity from 10 to 70\u00a0Hz, and to the acceleration force from 680 to 1500\u00a0Hz. These results clearly indicate that a piezoelectric sensor is impractical to use for the texture measurement and should be replaced with an accelerometer that always generates an acceleration signal irrespective of the applied vibration frequencies. The results also demonstrated that the previously defined texture index (TI) was misleading and overestimated the texture of food at probe vibration frequencies above 10\u00a0Hz. Our replacement of the sensor led us to define a new energy texture index (ETI). ETI measurement of several foods, including biscuit, Japanese cracker and vegetables were presented and the effects of water activity of cracker on the index were examined.",

     "abstract": "Requirements related to food safety and associated legislation and certification have increased a lot in recent years. Among these are the requirements for systematic recordings to be made throughout the supply chain so that in case of a food crisis it is possible to trace back to source of contamination, and to perform a targeted recall of potentially affected food items. These systematic recordings must be connected to the food items through unique identifiers, and the recordings, the identifiers and the documentation of how ingredients and food items join or split up as they move through the supply chain is what constitutes a traceability system. For the food industry, the traceability system is also an important tool for controlling and optimizing production, for getting better industrial statistics and better decisions, and for profiling desirable product characteristics. Current status is that many food producers have good, often electronic traceability systems internally, but exchange (especially electronic exchange) of information between the links in the supply chain is very time-consuming or difficult due to the diversity and proprietary nature of the respective internal systems. To facilitate electronic interchange of this type of data, an international, non-proprietary standard is needed; one that describes how messages can be constructed, sent and received and also how the data elements in the messages should be identified, measured and interpreted. The TraceFood Framework was designed for this purpose, and it contains recommendations for \u201cGood Traceability Practice\u201d, common principles for unique identification of food items, a common generic standard for electronic exchange of traceability information (TraceCore XML), and sector-specific ontologies where the meaning and the inter-relationship of the data elements is defined.

Better firmness predictions (R\u00a0=\u00a00.87) were obtained, compared to SSC predictions (R\u00a0=\u00a00.79). Fruit orientation had no or insignificant effect on the firmness and SSC predictions.

Drying experiments were carried out on dryer equipped with computer vision systems using hot air drying (HAD) temperatures of 50\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C and superheated steam drying (SSD) temperatures of 110\u2013120\u00a0\u00b0C at drying medium velocities of 1\u20132\u00a0m/s. Zero-, first-order, and fractional conversion models were utilized to describe the color changes of shrimps and the fractional conversion model successfully tracked the experimental data. The results showed that the color parameters were significantly influenced by the studied parameters. Lightness of the samples decreased, while other color parameters increased as drying proceeded. Generally, increasing drying medium temperature decreased L\u2217 and H\u00b0, whereas increased other color parameters. The color characteristic of the SSD finished products were acceptable than the HAD processed samples. Finally, dimensionless moisture content of shrimps during drying was accurately correlated to the color parameters and drying time using a quadratic regression model. Moisture ratio had strong relationship with the lightness change compared with the redness and yellowness variations.",

     "abstract": "The flow of plasticized maize starch in a co-rotating twin screw extruder was simulated by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Sensitivity of the simulation to the selected viscosity model was analyzed. The results suggest that about 16 times increase in zero shear viscosity has no influence on the flow, whereas a slight change in viscosity at the shear thinning region leads to significant increase in pressure drop along the mixing zone of extruder. Simulation results were validated quantitatively by experimental data. Furthermore, the flow type and profile in the extruder were discussed by using the influence of screw speed and screw configuration as exemplary process parameters. To evaluate the dispersive mixing efficiency, material specific critical capillary number was implemented into particle tracking simulations. Maximum shear stress generated at the tip of the screws was used to calculate the maximum capillary ratio, and therefore to determine the dispersive mixing efficiency. The results show that increase in screw speed led to better dispersive mixing, although the generated shear stresses decreased. To investigate the influence of screw geometry, two different screw configurations were simulated. The results show that the dispersive mixing efficiency can be improved by using reverse kneading blocks at which more particles are exposed to high shear stresses.",

Hence, recycling such solutions appears as an attractive alternative to reduce these costs. Recycling requires that a suitable green process is set which take into account the extreme physicochemical conditions prevailing during the cleaning of equipments of food or textile industries. Unfortunately, most of the processes used so far for water treatment are not efficient at high temperature (80\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C) or extreme pH (pH 1 and 14) which are commonly encountered in CIP. Purposely, Na-bentonite, in its crude or activated forms, was used to evaluate its potential for organic and mineral matter removal from such solutions. The resulting adsorption isotherms acquired at two temperatures, various pH values and salt concentrations were analyzed through the Langmuir, Freundlich and BET models. It is concluded that Na-bentonite action is based on a combination of adsorption and carrying capacity, the latter being related to its ability to coagulate at extremes pH. The efficiency of this innovative regeneration process combining adsorption/coagulation and flocculation was successfully tested by using synthetic industrial solutions mimicking those found in the dairy industry.",

The influence of the addition of three different plasticizer concentrations was studied by determining tensile properties, while Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to evaluate the structural and thermal behavior of such films. The addition of glycerol resulted in a reduction in the elastic modulus and tensile strength, while some increase in the elongation at break was observed. In general terms, SC films showed flexibility higher than the corresponding CC counterparts. In addition, the presence of carvacrol caused further improvements in ductile properties suggesting the presence of stronger interactions between the protein matrix and glycerol, as it was also observed in thermal degradation studies. FTIR spectra of all films showed the characteristic bands and peaks corresponding to proteins as well as to primary and secondary alcohols.

A sphere serves here as a representative model for many spherical food products. The shear stress transport (SST) k\u2013\u03c9 turbulence model performs exceptionally well when combined with low-Reynolds number modelling (LRNM) of the boundary layer, which confirms that the turbulence model characteristics are particularly suitable to deal with this specific flow problem. Especially the k\u2013\u03b5 turbulence models are less accurate at higher Reynolds numbers (>102). Boundary-layer modelling with wall functions (WFs) leads to inaccurate flow-field and scalar transfer predictions, compared to LRNM. However, LRNM grids and their inherently higher computational cost are often not practically feasible, leaving WFs as the only option.

     "abstract": "A SPG rotating membrane device was used to produce food grade O/W emulsions. The emulsion droplet size: (i) decreases with increasing rotational velocity (RV), due to higher detaching drag force acting on the droplets, and (ii) increases with increasing trans-membrane pressure (TMP), due to higher interface formation rate.The droplet size is also affected by the type and concentration of an emulsifier. Reducing the concentration of Tween 20, leads to an increase in the droplets size due to a concentration-dependent surfactant adsorption process. At Tween 20 concentrations\u00a0>\u00a0CMC, a rapid decrease in the interfacial tension results in production of relatively small droplets, independent of the applied RV. At concentrations\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0CMC, the advective mass transport accelerates adsorption, thus the droplet size reduces as the RV increases. When 1% WPI is used, it stabilises O/W emulsions produced with the membrane and showed no effect of the RV on the droplet size. The WPI-stabilised emulsions had similar droplet size to those stabilised with 1% Tween 20.The emulsion droplet size increased as the viscosity of the continuous phase was higher. When the RV increases, the viscosity of the shear-thinning solutions reduces and the role of advective transport increases, aiding interfacial tension decrease and the production of small droplets.",

     "abstract": "Since many years food engineers have attempted to describe physical phenomena such as heat and mass transfer that occur in food during unit operations by means of mathematical models. Foods are hierarchically structured and have features that extend from the molecular scale to the food plant scale. In order to reduce computational complexity, food features at the fine scale are usually not modeled explicitly but incorporated through averaging procedures into models that operate at the coarse scale. As a consequence, detailed insight into the processes at the microscale is lost, and the coarse scale model parameters are apparent rather than physical parameters. As it is impractical to measure these parameters for the large number of foods that exist, the use of advanced mathematical models in the food industry is still limited. A new modeling paradigm \u2013 multiscale modeling \u2013 has appeared that may alleviate these problems. Multiscale models are essentially a hierarchy of sub-models which describe the material behavior at different spatial scales in such a way that the sub-models are interconnected. In this article we will introduce the underlying physical and computational concepts. We will give an overview of applications of multiscale modeling in food engineering, and discuss future prospects.",

     "abstract": "In order to evaluate the impact of chitosan on the physical properties of wheat starch\u2013glycerol films, part of the wheat starch was replaced by chitosan, and the effect of composition on the properties of both the films and the film-forming dispersions was studied. The latter became more stable and viscous as the chitosan proportion was increased in the mixture. Both polymers appeared to integrate homogeneously in the film matrix. The combined effect of the glycerol and chitosan proportions affected the mechanical and barrier properties of the films. The tensile strength and elastic modulus of the films were improved as chitosan ratio increased. The oxygen and water vapor permeability slightly increased in line with the amount of chitosan in the blend although the induced differences were very small. Chitosan ratio directly affected the antimicrobial properties of the films, which showed a significant bactericide activity when the chitosan\u2013starch ratio in the film was 50%. Nevertheless, at a starch:chitosan ratio of 80:20, counts of coliforms did not exceed the initial value in the meat after 7 storage days.",

Two major food-borne pathogens, Escherichia coli and Salmonella are examples of Gram-negative bacteria which cause a large number of outbreaks of food poisoning. New types of planar interdigital sensors have been fabricated with different coating materials to assess their response to endotoxins. A carboxyl-functional polymer, APTES (3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane) and Thionine were chosen to be coated onto FR4 interdigital sensors. The chosen coating materials have carboxylic or amine functional groups, which were optimized to be stable in water. All coated sensors were immobilized with PmB (Polymyxin B) which has specific binding properties to LPS. The sensors were tested with different concentrations of LPS O111:B4, ranging from 0.1 to 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Analyses of sensors\u2019 performance were based on the impedance spectroscopy method. The impedance spectra were modeled using a constant phase-element (CPE) equivalent circuit, and a principal component analysis (PCA) was used for data classification.

The experiments were repeated by coating APTES and immobilizing PmB to a new improve designed of novel interdigital sensors (thin film silicon based sensors). These sensors were observed to have better sensitivity and selectivity to the target biomolecules of LPS. Further experiments were conducted to study the effect of different coating thickness on sensor sensitivity, selectivity and stability.

Internal structure of coffee bean was analyzed by optical microscopy for endosperm and parchment. From the expression of the dissipation in the grain due to the water transport, we show that a relationship formally analogous to an equation of diffusion governs the water transport. Three structures with mass transfer resistance potential are studied: parchment, silver skin and endosperm. An experimental technique to study the water transfer into the parchment was proposed. In the endosperm, for moisture contents above 65%, a constant transport coefficient controls the drying kinetics of the whole bean. Below this moisture content, water transport coefficient (with and without silver skin) were significantly lesser than those for the whole bean. This is firstly due to the reduction of the pore space occupied by water and second to the increasing bonding energy between solid structure and water as moisture content decreases. The contribution of parchment to the protection of the endosperm is highlighted.",

However lubrication properties of the material cannot be completely predicted by comparison to rheology data in these cases. Investigating viscosity across a range of samples after production in both pieces of equipment, where no differences were found it is assumed similar particles were produced, in the case of small differences for low concentration samples the high shears associated with the narrow gap sizes in tribology are suggested to have created very small particles leading to a viscosity reduction.",

It has been shown that for the same pressure drop across the two chambers, similar droplet sizes are produced (after 5 passes). Differences in droplet size were observed after a single pass, with the HPH producing larger droplets with a wider distribution of sizes. This difference can be attributed to the design of the homogenisation chambers with the HPH producing a wide distribution of shearing forces, so all of the starting emulsion does not experience the maximum stresses at each pass. Droplet size has been shown to be independent of viscosity ratio (0.1\u201380) for both homogenisers indicating that breakup is occurring in turbulent flow. No effect of emulsifier was observed in the Microfluidizer with SDS, Tween 20 and sodium caseinate. However, with the HPH, the droplet size reached a limiting value after 2 passes with SDS while with Tween 20 and sodium caseinate 5 passes were required indicating that coalescence occurs in the HPH but this is more effectively eliminated by SDS.",

The activation energy of swelling calculated for isothermal treatment varied between 41 and 318\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121, depending on the mathematical model considered. Therefore, without a consensus on the mechanism and order of reaction followed during gelatinization, the meaningful of kinetic parameters calculated using mathematical models seems highly questionable.

The extraction of soy proteins was conducted by using a 23 factorial experimental design, pH (7.5 or 9), solvent (0.06\u00a0M KCl or water), and temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C or 50\u00a0\u00b0C).

Shear flow behaviour, water retention capacity (WRC), pick-up as well as cooked yield of the prepared batters were also examined. Flow curves showed that all studied batters were pseudoplastic, i.e. having shear thinning characteristics. In addition, it was found that the substitution of 20% (w/w) cross-linked starches for wheat flour in the batter formulation significantly reduced the consistency index and WRC of the batters. However, batter pick-up and cooked yield values were insignificantly affected. Oil uptake of fried chicken crusts was determined using differential scanning calorimetry due to its specific advantages over the conventional solvent extraction method. In comparison to the control (wheat) formulation, crusts of fried chicken samples obtained from the formulations containing 20% (w/w) cross-linked starch showed significantly lower oil content by at least 17% relative oil reduction. The highest relative oil reduction was found in the batter containing the highly cross-linked tapioca starch. Furthermore, an increase in water content in the batter formulations resulted in a reduction in the batter pick-up, cooked yield and oil absorption. The degree of cross-linking which in turn resulted in the limited starch granule disintegration is the predominant factor in the reduction of oil content for deep-fried battered food.",

In this research, we studied the influence of chitosan addition on the properties of oil-in-water emulsions containing whey protein-coated lipid droplets. Experiments were carried out under conditions where the protein and polysaccharide had similar charges (pH 3.0) or opposite charges (pH 6.5). At pH 3.0, chitosan addition (0\u20130.025%) had little influence on droplet charge, aggregation, creaming stability or shear viscosity of whey protein emulsions, which was attributed to the fact that the cationic chitosan molecules did not adsorb to the cationic droplet surfaces due to electrostatic repulsion. At pH 6.5, chitosan addition caused a decrease in particle negative charge, an increase in particle size, a decrease in creaming stability, and an increase in viscosity. These effects were attributed to droplet aggregation caused by charge neutralization and bridging resulting from attraction of cationic chitosan molecules to anionic patches on the protein-coated droplet surfaces. Addition of cationic polyelectrolytes to protein-stabilized emulsions may be utilized to control their physicochemical properties, stability and biological fate, which may be useful for developing commercial products with novel or improved functional properties.",

The present work evaluated the effect of HPH (up to 150\u00a0MPa) on the viscoelastic properties of tomato juice. HPH increased the tomato juice storage (G\u2032) and loss (G\u2033) moduli. The parameters G\u2032 and G\u2033 were modelled as a power function of the oscillatory frequency (\u03c9), and then evaluated as a function of homogenization pressure. It was observed that HPH processing improved tomato juice consistency more than it modified its nature/behaviour. The changes observed in the viscoelastic properties were attributed to disruption of the suspended particles during processing. Moreover, two modified Cox\u2013Merz rules were used to correlate the products steady-state shear properties with viscoelasticity. The results obtained indicated that this process could be used to improve both product elastic and viscous behaviour, highlighting possible applications of the HPH process as a valuable tool to promote physical property changes in food products.",

The parameters were estimated at different amylose content using both ordinary least squares nonlinear regression and the sequential method.

The model was validated by using the parameters to predict viscosity for the same starch in a different measuring system, i.e., the RVA.

The following parameters were significantly affected by amylose content: kg and Eg both decreased with amylose content by an power-law relationship.

Ultrafiltration/nanofiltration technology can be used to fractionate protein hydrolysates in order to obtain permeate products with increased functionality and free from intact proteins and enzymes. The influence of the pH in the fractionation of the hydrolysate through a polyethersulfone membrane (MWCO 5\u00a0kDa) was investigated in this work. In this case peptide transmission was mainly governed by charge mechanisms and reached its maximum value when the pH value is close to the peptide isoelectric point. Almost complete rejection of acidic peptides was achieved at basic pH values due to electrostatic repulsive forces with the negatively charged membrane and, in agreement with Donnan theory, positively charged peptides shown lower transmission than the neutral species. The highest peptide recovery and the best separation factor between bioactive and non-bioactive peptides were obtained following nanofiltration at pH 8.0.",

The structure characterization was conducted by measuring the strength of the cocoa butter crystal network with traction tests combined with DSC melting curves. Subsequent storage stability was evaluated with DigiEye technique for fat bloom development and gravimetrical techniques for fat/moisture migration. The two pre-crystallization processes generated significantly different structures and storage stability. Well-tempered \u03b2VI-seeding resulted in a dense and homogenous chocolate structure directly after solidification, which was optimal in order to retard fat bloom and fat migration. However, a too high structure density generated heterogeneous structures with reduced ability to withstand fat bloom. A lower structure density exhibited optimal resistance against moisture migration.",

     "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the addition of methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose on the thermal, mechanical and water adsorption properties of starch-based films plasticized with glycerol or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Mechanical tests showed that as the methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose proportion increased, starch films became more resistant to break, resulting in higher TS values. Besides there has been a positive effect on the elasticity of starch films realized by a considerable increase in E% values. Depending on the plasticizer type, either single or dual glass transitions were seen in DSC thermograms. One glass transition temperature was observed for films plasticized with glycerol, on the contrary, dual glass transitions were detected for PEG plasticized films. This behavior was attributed to the phase separation of the PEG. In addition, the presence of an endothermic peak in the thermograms of PEG plasticized films was taken as another indicator of the phase separation. As a result, it was suggested that PEG was not as compatible as glycerol with the composite polysaccharide matrix and plasticizer type was the main factor that shaped the thermal profiles of the film samples. Water adsorption isotherm data showed that samples displayed nonlinear sorption profile which is typical for hydrophilic films. In all films tested, equilibrium moisture contents, increased almost linearly up to a aw of 0.65\u20130.85, beyond where a sharp increase was noted. Adsorption data was adequately fitted by BET and GAB models. Eventually, it can be concluded that film forming properties of starch can be improved by incorporation of methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose to the polymer matrix.",

     "abstract": "Oil palm is Malaysia\u2019s major agriculture product and it covers approximately 5 million hectares of Malaysia\u2019s land. Limited land resources have been an important factor that motivated the need to increase oil extraction rate (OER). OER of oil palm fresh fruit bunches (FFB) depends highly on their maturity stage. The ripe oil palm FFB will produce high OER while the under ripe and over ripe oil palm FFB will produce less oil. Thus, this paper presents a method of classification between oil palm FFB into ripe, under-ripe and over-ripe categories. This research was done at an oil palm plantation in peninsular Malaysia. A total of two-hundred and ten oil palm FFB that consist of seventy bunches for each category of under-ripe, ripe and over-ripe had been used. Each bunch was scanned ten times randomly with a hand-held multi-parameter fluorescence sensor called Multiplex\u00ae3. The parameter measured was the Blue-to-Red Fluorescence Ratio (BRR_FRF) obtained from blue-green (447\u00a0nm) and far-red (685\u00a0nm) emission signal by using ultraviolet (UV) light emitting diode as excitation light source. The novel contribution of this research is to prove that the oil palm FFB maturity can be determined using the Blue-to-Red Fluorescence ratio index. This is based to our finding of a significant difference among the three categories of ripeness based on the parameter. Classification and Regression Tree (C&RT) method was proposed in this paper. Hundred-fifty samples were used to develop the model by trained it using C&RT method and the remaining sixty samples for the test component. By using the C&RT method, the results show the best accuracy of overall testing classification is 90%. This research will be useful for future development of non-destructive, automatic and real time oil palm FFB grading system.",

A treatment of 13.55\u00a0J/mL reached 0.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04, 0.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13, 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32, 0.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, 2.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05, 5.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23, and more than 6\u00a0Log10 cycles of inactivation of E. coli STCC 4201 suspended in commercial sterilized orange juice at 25.0, 40.0, 50.0, 52.5, 55.0, 57.5, and 60.0\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The comparison of UV resistance at 25\u00a0\u00b0C with heat resistance at mild temperatures demonstrated a synergistic effect of both technologies applied simultaneously. The maximum synergistic lethal effect was reached at 55\u00a0\u00b0C (68.03%).A UV light treatment (23.72\u00a0J/mL) at 55\u00a0\u00b0C (3.6\u00a0min) of freshly squeezed orange juice allowed reaching more than 5\u00a0Log10 cycles of inactivation of a E. coli cocktail (STCC 4201, STCC 471, ATCC 27325, ATCC 25922, and O157:H7 Chapman strain). The selected treatment did not affect the pH, acidity, Brix, and color, and decreased 16.45% ascorbic acid content and 63.96% the Pectinmethylesterase activity.",

However, the WVP of various gelatin film types was reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) when a screw speed of 400\u00a0rpm was employed. Increasing the speed of extrusion promoted (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased solubility of films in water.

Images were acquired and analysed using the Grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method. Food boluses were successfully discriminated: 60\u201373% of the images were correctly classified into their respective chewing cycles. Incorrect classifications arose from overlapping between subsequent cycles. Among the texture features the contrast was identified as being the best marker of food degradation. Different kinetics of bolus formation were observed between breads. This method revealed specific patterns of food degradation between subjects, which could be explained by their mastication behaviour and chewing efficiency.",

Thermal treatment of crabs is necessary to denature muscle proteins, facilitating meat detachment from the crab shell (picking procedure). The proximal composition, protein patterns of crab muscle, thermophysical properties and heat transfer coefficients were determined. Heat transfer during thermal processing of body (i.e., cephalothorax) and claws of both crab species was simulated using a finite element computational code; the simulations were experimentally validated. Color changes in crab muscle during the heating process were measured. Thermal denaturation kinetics of myofibrillar proteins was determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) in small samples previously heated in water under controlled conditions. DSC thermograms of raw crab muscle showed two peaks at 49.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 and 77.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0\u00b0C corresponding to myosin and actin respectively. Activation energies for the denaturation of myosin (145.70\u00a0kJ/mol) and actin (156.42\u00a0kJ/mol) were calculated from Arrhenius equation. The degree of denaturation achieved by the myofibrillar proteins at the coldest point of the muscle in body and claws during the heating process was established by considering the protein denaturation kinetics determined by DSC, the activation energies and the heat penetration curves. Adequate conditions for the detachment of meat from the crab exoskeleton were established. The obtained results may help in determining the optimal heating times during the industrialization of these crustaceans.",

Specifically, \u2018Goha\u2019 strawberry samples were treated with 50\u00a0ppm aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and 5\u00a0kJ/m2 ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation and packed with rice bran protein (RBP) film containing 1% grapefruit seed extract (GSE). The initial population of total aerobic bacteria in the strawberries was 3.15 log CFU/g, while that of samples treated with ClO2/UV-C and packed with RBP film containing GSE was 1.64 log CFU/g. In terms of yeast and mold populations, the control had 2.98 log CFU/g, while the samples treated with the combined non-thermal processing and packed with the RBP film had 1.09 log CFU/g. In addition, after 11\u00a0days of storage, combined non-thermal treatment with RBP film packaging reduced the initial populations of total aerobic bacteria and of yeast and molds in the strawberries by 2.63 and 2.84 log CFU/g, respectively. Titratable acidity (TA) in the strawberries decreased during storage, but there was no significant difference among treatments. Postharvest treatments employed in this study produced a negligible change in the color of the strawberries, and sensory evaluation results indicated that the combined postharvest treatments provided better sensory scores compared with the control group. Therefore, these results suggest that a postharvest treatment consisting of 50\u00a0ppm ClO2/5\u00a0kJ/m2 UV-C with RBP film packaging containing GSE may be useful for maintaining the quality of \u2018Goha\u2019 strawberries.",

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy combined with image analysis were used to investigate the effect of core particle size and its distribution on the thickness and quality of the coating. Particle size significantly affected the thickness and quality of the coating, due to differences in the corresponding fluidization patterns, as corroborated by PEPT observations.

Heat treated flour allows high ratio recipes to be developed which generate products with longer shelf life, finer texture, moist crumb and sweeter taste. The mechanism by which heat treatment improves the flour is not fully understood, but it is known that during the heat treatment process, protein denaturation and partial gelatinisation of the starch granules occurs, as well as an increase in batter viscosity. Therefore, it is important to optimize the flour heat treatment process, in order to enhance baking quality. Laboratory preparation of heat treated base wheat flour (culinary, soft, low protein) was carried out in a fluidised bed drier using a range of temperatures and times. The gluten was extracted from the final product and its quality was tested, to obtain objective and comparative information on the extent of protein denaturation. The results indicated that heat treatment of flour decreases gluten extensibility and partial gelatinisation of the starch granules occurred. After heat treatment the gluten appeared to retain moisture.

     "abstract": "A mathematical model describing simultaneous solvent diffusion and gelatinization of starch was used to explain the water and calcium absorption in threshed corn grains during the thermo-alkaline treatment. A computer-aided nonlinear optimization technique was used to find the effective diffusion coefficients and the reaction rate constants of water and calcium in threshed corn grains at boiling temperature (92.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00b0C). The mathematical model shows good correlation between measured and predicted values of water and calcium intake. It is concluded that the cooking process is limited by the reaction of starch components with water and calcium. The effective diffusion coefficient for water varied between 1.18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210 and 1.45\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0m2/s and for calcium between 8.55\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210and 16.77\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0m2/s.

According to these effective diffusion coefficient values the diffusive process seems to be slower for water than for calcium. However, the reaction rate constant values are approximately 10 times higher for water than for calcium which may indicate that a higher amount of solvent was linked in the water diffusion process due to the gelatinization. Low concentration of Ca(OH)2 such as 0.10% did not significantly affect the water diffusion of threshed corn during the cooking process.",

Cake filtration was the dominant mechanism in the early stages of most of the CFMF processes. After approximately 20\u00a0min, however, intermediate pore blocking and complete pore blocking contributed to the overall fouling mechanisms.The reduction of the antioxidant capacity of the permeates obtained after microfiltration of the enzyme-treated pulp was higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) than that obtained using untreated pulp. For total polyphenols, on the contrary, the permeates obtained after microfiltration of the enzyme-treated pulp showed a lower mean reduction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) than those from the untreated pulp. The results show that the enzymatic treatment had a positive effect on the CFMF process of a\u00e7a\u00ed pulp.",

At pH 7, the most remarkable result was the higher stabilizing foam capacity of glycoconjugates as compared to native and heat treated SC, as a result of the higher elastic character and cohesion of the interfacial film formed by glycated SC. At pH 5, native and control heated SC underwent a significant loss of solubility, resulting in a worse dynamic of adsorption at the interface of such systems and the formation of fluid and poorly resistant films. However, solubility of glycated SC remained relatively high, so that, at this pH, only SC glycoconjugates showed interfacial characteristics suitable to stabilize the foam during its formation as well as against mechanisms of foam destabilization at long term. This behavior was attributed to the higher adsorption efficiency and degree of interfacial interaction exhibited by the SC glycoconjugates. These findings highlight the beneficial effect of glycation on the foaming properties of SC which could contribute to broadening the applicability of SC as a foaming agent, mainly in acid foods.",

     "abstract": "The structural aspects of proteins prepared from tomato seeds were studied by dynamic rheology, modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The critical gel point was determined from storage (G\u2019) and loss (G\u201d) moduli as functions of time and frequency. The findings indicate that tomato-seed proteins can create gels during heat treatment at 90\u201395\u00a0\u00b0C. Mechanical spectra of the tomato-seed protein gels were classified as weak gels based on the frequency sweep, complex viscosity (\u03b7\u2217) and tan \u03b4 results. Moreover, G\u2019 and G\u201d changes were found to be dependent on both concentration and frequency. MDSC showed two peaks, with gelation temperatures (Td) of 70 and 87\u00a0\u00b0C, which we attribute to starch and globular protein fractions, respectively. The FTIR spectra show an increase in the absorbance of amides I and II after increasing the solid content from 1 to 10% w/w, indicating mostly \u03b2-sheet and \u03b1-helical conformations.",

     "abstract": "The objective of this study is to analyze the influence of temperature and reduced pressure on the convective heat transfer coefficient, h, during frying of products with different area/volume ratio. h was determined from surface temperature and moisture loss experimental data during frying of potato cylinders and \u201cchurros\u201d, at different oil temperatures (100, 120 and 140\u00a0\u00b0C) and moderate vacuum (19.5\u201325.9\u00a0kPa). The results obtained during vacuum frying were compared with those obtained at atmospheric pressure, both for the same oil temperature (140\u00a0\u00b0C) and for the same thermal gradient (40\u00a0\u00b0C). During frying, h changes considerably, reaching a maximum between 700\u20131600\u00a0Wm\u22122\u00a0K\u22121 in vacuum frying and 800\u20132000\u00a0Wm\u22122\u00a0K\u22121 in atmospheric frying. To quantify the effect of oil temperature, pressure and size of the product on h, a parameter called \u201cbubbling efficiency\u201d, BE, was defined. BE relates the bubble departure radius and the area/volume ratio of the product. An equation (the derivative of the Gompertz function) was proposed to estimate the mean heat convective coefficients for each frying condition as a function of BE (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.957). The relation between h and BE shows a maximum corresponding to an optimal bubbling pattern. Most of the vacuum frying settings are outside this optimum, being affected by the insulation effect of bubbles covering the surface.",

The atomization was carried out using a two-fluid nozzle in the laboratory study and a two-fluid nozzle or rotary atomizer in the pilot scale study. The extent of oxygen-induced death was determined using ascorbic acid in the feed and atomizing the feed with gaseous nitrogen. The lowest levels of bacterial death were observed at lowest characteristic shear rate and in the presence of nitrogen and ascorbic acid. Quantitative analysis showed that lower shear rate, creating an oxygen-limiting environment during atomization and drying, and using oxygen scavengers in the feed were successful in enhancing bacterial survival in spray drying. We also report for the first time that, at least for L. lactis, the extent of death during the atomization stage far outweighs death during the drying stage, and that the majority of bacterial death (up to 93%) occurs during the atomization stage. The death of bacteria was found to be less when using a rotary atomizer or when using a two-fluid nozzle atomizer at lower flow rate. This work shows that bacterial death during spray drying can be minimized by using oxygen scavengers such as ascorbic acid and/or an anaerobic atomizing medium (such as nitrogen), and by altering the spraying conditions.",

The rind percentage (from 12% to 50%), the ripening (from 13 to 31\u00a0months), the moisture content and the differences between true P\u2013R and competitors were determined by means waveguide spectroscopy. Preliminary tests were carried out in the 2\u201320\u00a0GHz frequency range (with a span of 1\u00a0GHz) to investigate which 1\u00a0GHz frequency range contains most information on the rind percentage and on the months of ripening.Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used to predict rind percentage, months of ripening and moisture in the previously selected frequency ranges (2\u20133, 5\u20136 and 17\u201318\u00a0GHz for the rind percentage; 2\u20133, 5\u20136 and 16\u201317\u00a0GHz for the months of ripening). Moreover, Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) analysis was used to discriminate the samples according to the rind percentage. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to discriminate true P\u2013R cheese from competitors. PLS models (test set validation) showed R2 values up to 0.944 (root mean square error of prediction in test set validation, RMSEp\u00a0=\u00a03.4%), 0.966 (RMSEp\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u00a0months) and 0.786 (RMSEp\u00a0=\u00a00.99%) for the prediction of rind percentage, months of ripening and moisture percentage, respectively. As a result only a part of the prediction of rind percentage and ripening can easily be attributed to the moisture.For each considered frequency range, all samples belonging to the classes characterized by 12% and 50% of rind were correctly classified. Competitors were clearly separated from P\u2013R cheese by the PCA analysis of the spectral signals and their moisture was predicted with a R2 values up to 0.942 (test set validation). In this case, the discrimination power can be mainly attributed to moisture content.",

In general, no significant differences in moisture, total volatile basic nitrogen, pH, texture parameters, K1 value, or microbial counts between the different samples were observed. This revealed that the freezing process, storage time or number of freezing cycles did not affect the physico-chemical parameters of fish samples, except for water holding capacity, which was significantly lower in all frozen samples compared with fresh salmon.

Viscosity is measured in small temperature increments over a broad temperature range. A non-linear model is proposed which gives more statistically significant results than other known models in describing the temperature dependence of viscosity. Multiple quasi-linear regression analysis is applied to derive an expression that predicts oil viscosity from important frying conditions such as oil type, frying load, average oil temperature and frying time. For applications where only the initial oil temperature is known, a correlation is proposed for the prediction of the average oil temperature from the initial oil temperature and other frying conditions. The overall accuracy of the model in predicting the temperature dependence of viscosity on the examined frying conditions is better than 95.0%.",

A numerical approach is proposed for evaluating the thermal denaturation-aggregation of whey proteins, combining computational fluid dynamics and the population balance equation. The approach is illustrated by the evolution of a suspension of beta-lactoglobulin. Fluid flow and heat transfer are solved through the finite element method in the Eulerian frame, while product transformation is evaluated along representative Lagrangian trajectories.

In this study they are presented as possible foodstuffs, thickeners or films to cover food products. A precipitating agent and a bleaching agent were used to obtain decolorized globin from hemoglobin. To characterize these films, it was necessary to study their rheology and their resistance to external temperature. Rheological measurements were taken to characterize the gels in combination with the analysis of their microstructure, particle size, thermal behavior and water holding capacity. Results showed that G\u2032 (the elastic modulus) was higher than G\u2033 (the viscous modulus) and that the gelation point decreased with increasing pH for all the samples. Decolorized globin gels behaved dilatantly and presented a viscoelastic response, which was very suitable to form films to cover foodstuffs. DSC analysis corroborated the results obtained from rheological determinations and size distribution measurements presented unimodal curves for all the films. At basic pH, the globin gels were composed of tiny protein aggregates, forming a compact network without spaces between the particles in gels produced at pH 2. Gels produced at neutral pH were composed of a few large protein aggregates embedded in a matrix of smaller diameter particles. Furthermore, these gels presented an elevated moisture content and a very high WHC, which are desirable properties due to their potential applications.",

     "abstract": "The effect of adding corn oil (CO) and corn germ (CG) on the thermal and mechanical properties of corn semolina (CS) was investigated. The lipids concentration employed were 2% and 3% of CO or CG. The thermal transitions were studied in a moisture content range of 3\u201327% (d.b.), by means of dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experiments showed that type-V amylose\u2013lipid complexes were formed with the native lipids within the corn semolina during thermo-moulding and that re-crystallization to a type-A structure, favored by the added lipids, occurred upon storage in high relative humidity (RH) environments. Two thermal events were observed during the first DSC scan and tan\u00a0\u03b4 DMTA curves. The first one appearing at around 55\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C was attributed to a possible phase separation or ageing phenomenon taking place during storage of the samples, while the second was ascribed to the glass transition temperature of CS. It was found that addition of both, CO and CG, reduced the moisture content required for these transitions to appear. The expected decrease in the glass transition temperatures with moisture content was well described by the Gordon\u2013Taylor equation. The addition of CO and CG also causes plasticization of CS. Hence, corn germ meal can be used as a lipid source that is more convenient to handle than liquid fats. However, the CS Tg values were independent of the lipids content. Tensile properties of CS and CS-lipid systems were found to be influenced by the moisture content, the physical state of the samples, and their composition.",

Since four fluid components (liquid water phase, liquid fat phase, water vapor and air) are present in the pore space, a mass balance equation is written for each component.

A comparison between the air velocities measured by these two methods shows a good agreement at the internal side of the air curtain. However, these two methods give quite different result at the external side of the air curtain which can be explained by the complex air flow in this region. The temporal variation of the air temperature inside the air curtain is due partly to the \u201con/off\u201d compressor cycle and partly to the introduction of ambient air via vortices. The latter phenomena contribute to the rapid velocity fluctuations which are greatest in the mixing layer of the air curtain. The product position in the cabinet is a determining factor of its temperature.The convective and radiative heat flux between the products located at the front of the display cabinet and the air was also measured. Near the air supply and return ducts, the convective heat transfer coefficient was higher than between these two positions because of the high instability of air flow near the inlet and return ducts. The radiative exchange is more significant at the top of the display cabinet than at the bottom.",

The work was divided into three subsequent experimental trials: the first two were aimed to select the optimal packaging film mass transport properties, being micro-perforated and no-perforated films been tested. In the third experimental step, the best film (i.e., no-perforated oriented polypropylene, OPP40) was used to package sliced butternut squash under passive and active MAP. Each slice of product was dipped in aqueous solution of potassium sorbate, while no dipped samples were stored as the controls. During storage at refrigerated temperature (4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C) headspace gas concentrations, mass loss, microbiological and sensory quality were monitored. Results obtained from the preliminary pre-screening showed that micro-perforated films did not match fresh-cut butternut squash respiratory requirements. In these films a high proliferation of moulds occurred, probably due to elevated oxygen levels. Among the no-perforated films with different thickness, the OPP40 showed better performances. In the third trial samples dipped in potassium sorbate and packaged in OPP40 under active MAP recorded a shelf-life of about 22\u00a0days respect to the no-dipped samples packaged under both passive and active MAP that reached a shelf life of about 2\u00a0weeks.",

This process allowed small droplets to be formed (3\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm). Tempering could also be mimicked, with the temperature of the units affecting the polymorphic form of cocoa butter produced.

VI consists of removing the air present in a food by applying vacuum and replacing it with a given solution by recovering the atmospheric pressure. In this work, the goal was to study important parameters in the dynamics of VI and to propose a three-dimensional mathematical model (based on the Volume-of-Fluid model) for predicting the impregnation step in apple samples. An experimental device was built for determining the dynamics of VI. It was verified that the capillary radius that allowed for the best representation of the dynamics of vacuum impregnation were in the order of magnitude of micrometers, values that are in the range reported in the literature. The proposed mathematical model showed excellent predictive ability for three-dimensional simulation. However, for more accurate values, one should determine the parameters with improved accuracy.",

This research studied the influence of the operating conditions on the ice crystal size and the draw temperature of the sorbet during the freezing process. The evolution of ice crystal size was tracked with the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) technique, which uses an in situ sensor that makes it possible to monitor online the chord length distribution (CLD) of ice crystals in sorbets containing up to 40% of ice. The refrigerant fluid temperature had the most significant influence on the mean ice crystal chord length, followed by the dasher speed, whereas the mix flow rate had no significant influence. A decrease in the refrigerant fluid temperature led to a reduction in ice crystal size, due to the growth of more small ice crystals left behind on the scraped wall from previous scrapings. Increasing the dasher speed slightly reduced the mean ice crystal chord length, due to the production of new small ice nuclei by secondary nucleation. For a given refrigerant fluid temperature and dasher speed, low mix flow rates resulted in lower draw temperatures, due to the fact that the product remains in contact with the freezer wall longer. High dasher speeds warmed the product slightly, due to the dissipation of frictional energy in the product, the effect of which was in part moderated by the improvement in the heat transfer coefficient between the product and the freezer wall.",

ICP-MS results showed that tin and iron release increased with the storage time while EIS and EN results showed that coating resistance, charge transfer resistance and noise resistance decreased with the storage time, which indicated that the corrosion beneath the organic coating induced metal release. Consequently, a clear and direct relationship was obtained between the ICP-MS and the electrochemical results.

Empirical correlations based on food composition remain the only way to estimate the thermophysical properties of fresh-cut lettuce. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the thermophysical properties of several baby-leaf lettuce and brassica greens and (ii) to verify the measured thermophysical properties by using them in a heat transfer model and comparing the predicted product temperatures with measured product temperatures in a simulated interruption of a cold chain. Density, leaf thickness, thermal conductivity, specific heat and water activity from nine varieties of baby-leaf lettuce and brassica greens were measured. A broken cold chain was simulated in a low temperature incubator set at 10\u00a0\u00b0C for a length of time before readjustment at 2\u00a0\u00b0C. Results showed that density (1078\u20131112\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123), leaf thickness (0.18\u20130.54\u00a0mm), thermal conductivity (0.55\u20130.70\u00a0W (m\u00a0\u00b0C)\u22121) and specific heat (3.1\u20134.3\u00a0kJ (kg\u00a0\u00b0C)\u22121) varied significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) between varieties.

Two different models have been proposed in this work: a theoretical model derived assuming that holes permeability is constant, and an empirical model. The gas and water vapor permeability data were used to calculate the values of parameters for both models. The obtained values were used to predict the gas and water vapor permeability of tested films. The mean relative deviation modulus ( E \u00af % ) was used as a quantitative measure of the predictive ability of the models. Results suggest that the predictive goodness of the empirical model is much better than that of the theoretical one.

     "abstract": "Oscillatory shear rheology plays a valuable role in assessing rheological properties of viscoelastic materials. In the linear viscoelastic region (LVR), the stress response to a strain input comprises only the first harmonic. Beyond the LVR, higher-order harmonics have significant contributions, which are not accounted for in the traditional calculation of viscoelastic moduli. Previous study has developed a mathematical framework that accounted for higher-order harmonics during large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS), yielding a physical interpretation to nonlinear data. However, this protocol was not formally validated with model elastic and viscous systems. To that end, a model elastic solid and viscous liquid were tested using LAOS to compare the protocol to standard oscillatory data and the known nonlinear properties of both systems. Good agreement (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05) was shown between first-order harmonic viscoelastic moduli data for both systems in the linear region. The protocol correctly indicated linear-to-nonlinear transitions of the elastic system, strain-independent linear behavior of the viscous system, and strain-hardening behavior of the elastic system in the nonlinear region. These results indicate the validity of the protocol, which may be applied to food systems to give valuable insights into nonlinear behavior and elucidate structural keys to texture design.",

The absolute value of the slopes of log\u2013log plots between loss factor and frequency increased with increasing temperature at low frequencies, especially at high temperatures and moisture contents.

     "abstract": "A pouch that can be used to ohmically reheat and sterilize food and later reused to stabilize waste will significantly reduce the Equivalent System Mass during a long term space mission. Reheating of food and stabilization of waste have been successfully done in the past using a V-shaped electrode pouch using pulsed ohmic heating, however improvement of field distribution was needed. The main goals of this work were to develop an improved pouch design to facilitate uniform ohmic heating of food; to model ohmic sterilization within the pouch; and to verify the model through an inoculated pack study.The pouch was redesigned to improve the electric potential distribution and hence heating uniformity. A temperature distribution study on a pouch with 227\u00a0g of tomato soup showed the presence of cold regions at the non-electrode sides due to channeling of current through a hotter and more conductive centre. A much more uniform temperature distribution was obtained the use of two external strip heaters installed along these sides. The ohmic heating process inside the pouch was simulated in 3D to predict possible cold and hot spots. The simulated heating profile was in good agreement with the measured values confirming the efficacy of the model. An inoculated pack study using Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores (ATCC 5973) confirmed the mathematical model. This technology provides a new method of sterilization inside sealed pouches/packets using ohmic heating.",

The bowl cutter is described as a continuous stirred tank reactor, combined with a plug flow reactor in a repetitive series-model. The theoretical model shows that 30 rounds are sufficient to get a salt concentration in the whole bulk of meat with a deviation between maximum and minimum values of about 5%. The comparison of the theoretically predicted salt gradient and the experimental results showed that the mathematical equation developed is appropriate to describe the process.",

However, limited work has been published about the on-line implementation of NIR spectroscopy in this sector. NIRS application at factory level (olive mills) is desirable. However, prior its implementation, many parameters related to the on-line spectrum acquisition, must be studied and optimised. In this paper, the influence of parameters such as focal distance and integration time has been studied. On-line spectral measurements were performed on intact olives in the spectral range of 380\u20131690\u00a0nm using a diode array spectrometer located on the top of a conveyor belt. The statistical criteria used to evaluate the spectral repeatability for each level of parameters considered were the standard deviation (SD) of the log (1/R) values and the root mean square statistics (RMS). Results demonstrated that for on-line control of olives in movement, spectra acquisition process was more affected by the focal distance chosen than by the integration time used. A focal distance of 13\u00a0mm and an integration time of 5\u00a0s have been defined as the optimal operational conditions.",

The experimental system is the tubular heat exchanger and the helical holding section of a laboratory scale thermal process. RTD was measured in isothermal conditions at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, a temperature involving no WP aggregation, and at 87\u00a0\u00b0C, temperature at which WP aggregates. Two flow rates (20\u00a0L/h and 49\u00a0L/h) were tested with two different lengths of holding tube in order to maintain the same order of magnitude of the holding time. Methylene blue was used as tracer and spectrophotometer analysis were performed to determine the outlet concentration. These investigations yielded to great differences between the RTD in aggregation and no aggregation conditions. The minimum residence time is shorter when WP aggregation occurs due to the modification of the velocity field inside the tubular devices with the local enhancement of the viscosity. Fitting the experimental results with a new compartment model based on the generalized convection model give very good agreement contrary to the more classical RTD models. This RTD model could be used in combination with a population balance model in order to predict the WP aggregates size dispersion.",

The addition of 20% v/v dried broccoli powder causes a significant increase in the shear modulus. For pure starch, the modulus increased with increasing pre-gelatinized starch concentration, whereas the shear modulus of starch containing broccoli particles decreased with increasing pre-gelatinized starch concentration. From viscosity measurements in the dilute regime, the swelling of the broccoli particles was determined. When dispersed in water the dried broccoli particles can swell to up to 7.6 times, and this swelling capacity has a significant effect in the rheological behavior of starch dough systems. When volume fractions up to 20% (v/v) are incorporated, the system acts as a cellular material, instead of a gelled matrix with dispersed particles. This observation was confirmed with confocal scanning laser microscopy.",

     "abstract": "Fluid gels offer a wide range of highly tuneable material properties, and as such, have potential use in numerous applications including reduced-fat food formulation. The formation and properties of fluid gels, produced here with kappa-carrageenan by applying shear during the gelation process, are discussed. A comparison is made between the thermal transitions of melting fluid gels and quiescently cooled gels. This has determined the former to have fewer and shorter helices as a result of shear interfering with the molecular ordering process during production. Fluid gel formation was investigated by controlling the shear profile while cooling so that shearing was stopped partway through gelation. This allowed control over the ratio of sheared to quiescent molecular ordering and therefore manipulation of the structures and properties of the gels. More than 98% of the molecular ordering is required to take place under shear to produce fluid gels without large particulates. The remaining disordered chains can then be used to control rheological properties whereby bridges may form between particles when ordered quiescently. Such bridges can be broken with shear, thereby eliminating the influence of the ratio of quiescent to sheared cooling.",

Two alternative imaging technologies are investigated; laser scatter imaging and polarised light stress images. After segmenting the seal area from the rest of the respective image, a classifier is trained to detect faults in different regions of the seal area using features extracted from the pixels in the respective region. A very large set of candidate features, based on statistical information relating to the colour and texture of each region, is first extracted. Then an adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) is used to automatically select the best features for discriminating faults from non-faults. With this approach, different features can be selected and optimised for the different imaging methods. In experiments we compare the performance of classifiers trained using features extracted from laser scatter images only, polarised light stress images only, and a combination of both image types. The results show that the polarised light and laser scatter classifiers achieved accuracies of 96% and 90%, respectively, while the combination of both sensors achieved an accuracy of 95%. These figures suggest that both systems have potential for commercial development.",

Below those critical values, the glassy state of the amorphous matrix is guaranteed, thus avoiding an increase in the rate of the deteriorative reactions related to the loss of the bioactive compounds in the fruit (organic acids, vitamin C, main flavonoids, and total phenols) which contribute to the antioxidant capacity (AAO) of grapefruit. In the rubbery state, a certain time is needed for these degradative reactions to start. This time depends on the water content of the sample, the greater the water content the lower the time needed. In this study, the powder was stable for a relatively long storage time (3\u00a0months) regardless the relative humidity, due to the limited mobility of the molecular system. Between 3 and 6\u00a0months had to pass before a significant loss of bioactive compounds was observed; the higher the relative humidity, the greater the loss.",

An in-house developed shearing device was used that enabled the application of controlled shear flow and rheological characterization of the native maize starch\u2013triglyceride blends at shear stresses of up to 37\u00a0kPa. Due to the high viscosity of starch matrix, the viscosity ratio of the continuous starch phase and the dispersed triglyceride phase varied between 10\u22127 and 10\u22125. It was possible to create small droplets with a droplet diameter of 2.1\u00a0\u03bcm using simple shear flow only. An increase in shear rate had no influence on droplet diameter. However, an increase in oil content led to a vast increase in droplet diameter indicating the occurrence of coalescence. The results further show that the maximum stable droplet size in plasticized starch is significantly smaller (up to 100 times) than the predicted values for a Newtonian matrix. The differences of plasticized starch to Newtonian matrices are discussed in detail.",

Principal component analysis (PCA) and Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) were used to distinguish among different maturities (mature green, pink and red). Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to estimate textural properties, alcohol insoluble solids and soluble solids content of the tomatoes. The PCA calibration model with mean normalization pretreatment spectra of mature green tomatoes, gave the highest distinguishability (96.85%). It could classify 100.00% of red and pink tomatoes. The SIMCA model could not give better accuracy in maturity classification than individual PCA models. Among the textural parameters measured, the bioyield force from the puncture test with the near infrared (NIR) spectra (between 1100 and 1800\u00a0nm) pretreated by multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) had the highest correlation coefficient between NIR predicted and reference values (r\u00a0=\u00a00.95) and lowest standard error of prediction (SEP\u00a0=\u00a00.35\u00a0N) and bias of 0.19\u00a0N.

Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT), a novel, simple, and robust method of process imaging when conducted on two adjacent planes on a pipeline, provides the ability to extract multi-dimensional qualitative and quantitative flow information. The application of an ERT system to flow monitoring and control in the dairy industry has not been researched comprehensively before.

Water, a different milk concentration and cream were used as the secondary solutions for the required conductivity variance for flow measurement. These results were studied and compared in order to provide a selection criterion for the secondary solution.

Supported algorithms were specifically developed and programmed for image acquisition and processing, controlling the whole process, saving the classification results and monitoring the progress of all operations. A database of images was first formulated from potatoes with different shapes and sizes, and then some essential geometrical features such as perimeter, centroid, area, moment of inertia, length and width were extracted from each image. Also, eight shape parameters originated from size features and Fourier transform were calculated for each image in the database. All extracted shape parameters were entered in a stepwise linear discriminant analysis to extract the most important parameters that most characterized the regularity of potatoes. Based on stepwise linear discriminant analysis, two shape features (roundness and extent) and four Fourier-shape descriptors were found to be effective in sorting regular and irregular potatoes. The average correct classification was 96.5% for a training set composed of 228 potatoes and then the algorithm was validated in another testing set composed of 182 potatoes in a real-time operation. The experiments showed that the success of in-line classification of moving potatoes was 96.2%.

The particle size distribution of the mist was determined at 95% RH and 20\u00a0\u00b0C in a small-scale storage chamber and its influence on respiration rate, and qualities of spinach were investigated over six days of storage by comparing it with the control (without the nano-mist application). The nano-mist was found to alter the particle size distribution of the mist in a spinach-storage chamber by decreasing the total concentration and increasing the geometric mean diameter. The results suggested that the geometric mean diameter of nano-mist was larger than the water vapor appeared in air and that evaporated from the surface of spinach leaves through transpiration; and the transpiration could minimize the influence of nano-mist in modification of particle size distribution. The respiration rate was slightly lower in the first three days, but thereafter non-significant differences on respiration rate and leaves color were observed over the storage period, mainly because the spinach was stored at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. However, based on the obtained results, it could be expected that the use of nano-mist has an advantage over the conventional mist humidification that always contribute to the deterioration from the microbial growth because of the large particle size deposition onto the produce surface.",

The findings from this study show that granularity plays a key role in the implementation of seafood traceability. Implementation of a coarse granularity level is easier and cheaper than a fine granularity level, but the benefits are also lower. Fine granularity level will increase the complexity of the traceability system, and will give higher costs. A complex traceability system can affect the practical solutions and specification of the information technology systems when implementing traceability. The key is to find the preferable granularity level where the benefits exceed the costs. Consequently, the costs and potential benefits associated with implementing traceability at different granularity levels should be identified.",

Commercial breakfast cereals and partially dehydrated pineapples prepared by osmotic dehydration and vacuum impregnation were used for the experiments. Four coating application techniques, working at atmospheric pressure or applying vacuum impregnation, were used for coating the pineapple samples. Coated and uncoated samples were stored, at 20\u00a0\u00b0C with breakfast cereals and were subsequently analyzed weekly during 6\u00a0months. Critical water activity and critical water content for the glass transition of the cereals at 20\u00a0\u00b0C were estimated as 0.60 and 9.1\u00a0g water/100\u00a0g of product, respectively. Results show that the application of coatings by vacuum impregnation and sample air drying after coating, considerably extends the shelf-life of the pineapple\u2013cereal system when caseinate based coatings are used. Chitosan based coatings are less effective to limit water vapor transfer and the critical moisture content of cereals are reached during the storage period.",

     "abstract": "Microwave ovens are used extensively for heating a variety of not-ready-to-eat food products. Non-uniform heating of foods in microwave ovens is a major concern in assuring microbiological safety of such products. The non-uniform heating of foods is attributed by complex interaction of microwaves with foods. To understand this complex interaction, a comprehensive model was developed to solve coupled electromagnetic and heat transfer equations using finite-difference time-domain based commercial software. The simulation parameters, cell size, heating time step, and number of iterations for steady state electromagnetic field were optimized. The model was validated by 30\u00a0s heating profile of a cylindrical model food (1% gellan gel) in a 700\u00a0W microwave oven. The model was validated qualitatively by comparing the simulated temperature profiles on three planes in the gel and compared them to the corresponding thermal images. Quantitative validation was performed by comparing simulated temperature of the gel at 12 locations with experimental temperature acquired at those points using fiber optic sensors. Simulated spatial temperature profiles agreed well with the thermal image profiles. The root mean square error values ranged from 0.53 to 4.52\u00a0\u00b0C, with an average value of 2.02\u00a0\u00b0C. This study laid a framework for selecting the required model parameters which are critical for better temperature prediction. The developed model can be effectively used to identify hot and cold spots in food products, thereby helping in microwaveable food product development to achieve better cooking performance in terms of heating uniformity, food quality and safety. The model can also be used to identify the best product, package and cavity parameters to achieve better heating uniformity and electromagnetic distribution inside the cavity.",

Hierarchical temporal clustering of the samples was made using normalized RGB image data, spectral image data and reconstructed spectral image data. Clustering results for spectral data were perfect. Reconstructed spectral data managed moderately, outperforming RGB data clearly. Finally, two critical wavelengths for temporal classification were determined.

In terms of total biofilm mass, removal decreases with increasing biofilm age. The largest reduction post-treatment (between 57% and 62%) was observed, to all Reynolds numbers, on 24 and 48\u00a0h-old biofilms.

The present work evaluated the effect of HPH (up to 150\u00a0MPa) on the time-dependent and steady-state shear rheological properties of tomato juice. HPH reduced the mean particle diameter and particle size distribution (PSD), and increased its consistency and thixotropy. The rheological results were in accordance with the PSD observed.

Breads were based on rice flour, cassava starch and full-fat active soy flour, with 65% or 75% (flour-starch basis) of water incorporation. Additives used were emulsifiers (diacetyl tartaric acid ester of monoglycerides \u2013 DATEM and sodium stearoyl lactylate \u2013 SSL), enzymes (glucose oxidase and \u03b1-amylase) and hydrocolloids (xanthan gum, carboxymethylcellulose, alginate and carrageenan). Results showed that additive incorporation modified dough behavior, evidenced by different calorimetric and rheological properties. Besides, the electrophoretic pattern of dough extracted proteins changed with glucose oxidase addition. These modifications resulted in breads with different characteristics, such as specific volume, firmness and firming rate, and crumb structure. Nonetheless, they did not necessarily show better quality parameters than the control bread. The control dough displayed good performance for obtaining gluten-free breads of acceptable volume, crumb structure and, principally, with lower hardening rate during storage. Contrary to widespread opinion, this work shows that the presence of additives is not essential for gluten-free bread production. This fact provides new perspectives to the gluten free market at the moment of selecting raw materials and technological parameters, reducing production costs and facilitating gluten free products development.",

From a puncture test, initial firmness, average firmness, apparent modulus of elasticity, rupture force, toughness, and deformation at the rupture point were sensitive to the maturity stages. The mature unripe tomato deformed linearly as a function of force; hence, the firmness was constant. However, the fully ripe tomato firmness increased as a function of applied force. The fruit strain increased during ripening, and it was independent of fruit size. The unripe tomato was more elastic than the ripe one. The peel at the mature green stage contributed approximately 70% of the firmness of the fruit and approximately 90% at the pink stage and red stage. The rupture force by the puncture test (traditionally, peak force) was correlated well with other textural parameters, which indicated that it could be used as a firmness representative parameter, as has been used by many researchers.

The simulated aqueous fruit juices containing four common aroma compounds were concentrated using osmotic distillation where the feed solution was in contact with a brine solution of CaCl2, through a hydrophobic macroporous membrane contactor. Aroma compounds absorbed in the extraction brine were extracted using a membrane evaporator under vacuum and collected into a cold trap. This way, both concentration and aroma recovery of fruit juices were achieved simultaneously using two hollow fiber membrane modules. The transfer of the aroma compounds was evaluated by using different operating variables such as hydrodynamic conditions, brine concentration and vacuum pressure. The experiments show that the loss of aroma compounds during the concentration processes can be avoided by means of extraction of the aroma compounds from the brine separately, resulting in an average of 75% recovery in aroma compounds. In general, the process of aroma removal and recovery is faster than the concentration process of the fruit juices by osmotic distillation at a technical and commercial level (higher than 45\u00b0Brix). Thus, the simultaneous operation of these two membrane processes can be used to decrease the energy requirements for a given production capacity.",

Then, the design strategy was applied in industrial scale crystallizer. The 13\u00a0h cooling profile created for operation in the medium MSZ region successfully produced crystals with 28% less fines than the typical process.

From such analysis a simplified model, capable of describing freeze\u2013drying at the time scales relevant to quality, has been proposed. The model has been solved by the Finite Element method, showing good agreement with the results in literature. Likewise, the efforts associated with the computation of optimal operation policies have been reduced.In this regard, different operational scenarios that take into account shelf temperature ( T L ) and chamber pressure ( P c ) have been considered on a simulation basis. In all cases the resulting optimal control profiles obtained led to significant reductions of cycle time while ensuring product quality.",

The optical properties of the surrounding tissue will influence the spectral characteristics of the light interacting with the object, and the spectral signature observed from the object will be directly affected. A method for calibrating the spectral signature of small objects, embedded in translucent material, by the estimated local background spectrum is presented. The method is evaluated under industrial conditions in a new hyperspectral imaging system for automatic detection of nematodes in cod fillets. The system operates at a conveyor belt speed of 400\u00a0mm/s which meets the industrial required speed of assessing one fillet per second. The local calibration method reduces the number of spectra needed to be classified by 89.6%. For one or more false alarms in 60% of the fillets sampled after the trimming station, the Gaussian maximum likelihood classifier detects 70.8% and 60.3% of the dark and pale nematodes, respectively. This is better than what is previously reported using a higher resolution instrument on a slow moving conveyor belt, and comparable or better to what is reported for manual inspection under industrial conditions.",

The only driving force of the process is the osmotic pressure difference between the two solutions that flow in counter-current mode on opposite sides of a permeable membrane. Thus, the main advantages of FO, compared to both thermal and conventional membrane processing, include low hydraulic pressure, low treatment temperature, low fouling tendency, high solids content processing capability and easy scale-up. A detailed, up-to-date summary of potential FO applications for concentrating liquid foods is presented in this review article.

The models were fitted to experimental measurements of moisture content of soybean grains over time by the least squares method. The results showed that the volume of soybean grains increased 30% from the beginning to the end of hydration and the effective diffusivity values of the variable volume model were about ten times larger than those obtained from the Hsu model, indicating that the hypothesis of constant volume adopted by Hsu is unrealistic and leads to considerable errors in the estimation of effective diffusivity of water in soybean grains.

Ultimately, to understand the crack formation in response to the existence of tensile and compressive stresses caused by moisture gradient in the grain during soaking. An empirical equation was developed to establish dependency of the diffusion coefficient of rice to both moisture content and temperature. Using a 3D replica of short grain japonica rice, the modeling was carried out using existing laws of diffusion and was validated using experimental data. Results showed that the rate of moisture diffusion and hygroscopic swelling were found to increase with increase in soaking temperature. The internal stress, however, was found to decrease with increase in soaking temperature. The simulated moisture content and increase in volume of rice grain were favorably in agreement with experimental results.

Full dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) matrix was completed using ultrasonication and high temperature annealing techniques. Nanomorphology and surface structure of PTFE and CNT-PTFE films on stainless steel surface were interpreted by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). To validate the hydrophobicity of the developed CNT-PTFE nanocomposite coated surface, a water contact angle (WCA) using a simplified sessile drop method, correspondent surface energy, foulant mass, and energy efficiency after milk pasteurization were estimated and compared with stainless steel 316 and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated surfaces. Static contact angles for the control, PTFE-coated and CNT-PTFE surfaces increased from 71.2 to 119.6 and 141.1\u00b0, respectively. By application of CNT-PTFE nanocomposite coating, the estimated surface energy of heat exchanger surface decreased by 97.0% of its original value. After continuous milk pasteurization for 5\u00a0h, the mass of foulant on CNT-PTFE coated heat exchanger surface was 70.3% less than that of the uncoated surface; thus, total energy consumption of test PHE unit also dropped down by 10.2%.

The results depict that oil drops are broken up according to emulsification mechanisms during atomization. A maximum breakup was found for a viscosity ratio between 0.5 and 1. The expected stress dependency of the drop size change was observed for high viscosity ratios only.

Starch pastes with GG or XG show very complex rheological behavior resulting from synergistic effects. This is reflected in the form of distributions of time constants, which have two peaks. One of them is specific to the non-starch hydrocolloid and corresponds to the characteristic time of approximately 1\u00a0s. Global maximum is located at the time of 0.001\u00a0s and is associated with the presence of starch and its gel structure. The differences in rheological characteristic times for various structure forming agents reflect their technological functions.",

     "abstract": "A mathematical model was developed to describe the coupled heat, mass and momentum transfer processes occurring in convective drying of prunes. In this model, the fruit is represented as a composite ellipsoidal body comprising of two materials (flesh and stone) having different properties. The model accounts for the variation of both air and food properties expressed as a function of temperature and moisture content. The resulting systems of transient non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in the space\u2013time domain together with the set of initial and boundary conditions were numerically solved by utilising the finite element method (FEM) coupled to the Arbitrary Lagrange\u2013Eulerian (ALE) procedure to account for the shrinkage phenomenon using a commercial package (COMSOL Multi-physics\u2122, Comsol AB, Stockholm, Sweden).A series of laboratory drying experiments were undertaken using a computer-controlled dehydration system developed to obtain drying kinetics data under varying operating conditions for validation of the predicted results from the proposed model. Comparison of the model predictions against the experimental results has shown a very good agreement, implying that the proposed numerical model can be used with confidence as a tool in optimising the design and operation of the prune drying system. A parametric study performed using the modelling tool has demonstrated the impact of key operational parameters on the drying kinetics. It is expected that the model can be applied for other food products and processes involving similar phenomena.",

Analysis of cohesiveness and adhesiveness showed that kefir with inulin had higher firmness. Rheological analysis revealed that all manufactured kefirs had higher storage than loss modulus, and exhibited thixotropic and shear thinning behaviour. There were no significant differences in odour and consistency between kefirs with and without inulin. Only in case of whole milk powder (WMP) kefir, panellists noticed the difference in flavour, although kefirs based on SMP had the same scores. Substitution of SMP by inulin allowed for reducing 15% and 37% of caloric value in comparison with SMP and WMP kefir, respectively.",

The viscosity of the product seems to have a major effect on how much product that will be adhered to the surface. The initial adhesion (the first 24\u00a0h) of product to material surface shows significant discrepancies whereas on longer time scales (days) it seems to be rather constant and independent of the fat content in the fermented milk or the material polarity.

To obtain optimal results, an automated monitoring system is required, but not yet available. Such a system must be able to identify the baking goods and the current state of the baking process represented by color and size of the baking goods.To develop such a system, digital image processing was used. An optical system was implemented, which was able to make digital images of the baking goods from inside the oven in a continuous form. The goal was the development of algorithms for distinction of baking goods and characterization of color saturation and shape, altogether resulting in an optical online process monitoring system. By using a modified Viola\u2013Jones algorithm the kind of baking good in the oven is identified with an error of 5.6%. The error of automated determination of the width and height change of bread rolls with respect to manual evaluation is less than 4%. Based on a neural network, the baking good is identified pixel by pixel. The training error of the neuronal net was 7.0%. This allows the calculation of the evolution of lightness and color saturation. Using this information, the state of the baking process is identified reliably.

A central composite design (CCD) was used considering three independent variables: supersaturation level, dimensionless vibration number, and crystallization time, while the seed population (100,000\u00a0U) and operation temperature (55\u00a0\u00b0C) were fixed. Optimization of the experimental data obtained in the CCD was done finding the condition of maximum yield, 164.7%, which was experimentally tested and resulted in yield of 187.7%. An experimental simulation of serial crystallizers was studied, obtaining 166.9% yield, which was effective for obtaining crystals of greater final dimension.",

The aims of this work were to evaluate the effect of temperature and number of film perforations on quality and develop shelf-life kinetic model for a modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for sliced button mushrooms. Sliced mushrooms were packed in a tray, covered with cellophane film, and stored for 7\u00a0days at four levels of temperature (0, 5, 10, and 15\u00a0\u00b0C) and three levels of perforations at each temperature ranging the number of perforations from 1 (58 perforations per m2) to 6 (349 perforations per m2). Headspace gas composition and quality parameters (weight loss, pH, firmness and colour) were measured throughout the storage period. Increasing the storage temperature required an increase of the number of perforations in order to obtain the optimum MAP conditions. Temperature had a significant effect (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) on quality of sliced mushrooms. Firmness was identified as a critical quality parameter; therefore, a kinetic model was developed to describe the influence of temperature on firmness and predict shelf-life of sliced mushrooms. Fresh sliced mushrooms had a shelf-life of 1, 2, 4, and 7.5\u00a0days at 15, 10, 5, and 0\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, under optimum MAP conditions.",

The serum model processed at 200\u00a0MPa showed a viscosity decrease of 20% when compared to the original.

Tomato paste filled cans were used to demonstrate the improvements in heating rates. In convection heating, recirculation in both side walls was observed computationally to lead to increased heat transfer rate while the cold point shifted from center towards to outer wall in conduction heating due to the effect of heat transfer from inside surface.

It is known that drying starch till 0% moisture is a physical treatment that modifies starch properties. However, depending upon the heat and mass transfer mechanisms prevalent in the drying system, starch properties are modified in a unique manner. Therefore, the drying operation itself needs to be thoroughly understood. Potato starch was treated in an oven at three high-temperature levels (110, 130 and 140\u00a0\u00b0C) and for three sample thicknesses (2.8, 5.6 and 11.2\u00a0mm). It was observed that drying of starch with moisture content in the hygroscopic range occurred only in the 2nd falling rate period. Two existing theoretical, drying models, one based upon the Krischer Theory and the other based upon the Percolation Approach, were considered apt for modelling the oven drying. Both models describe the experimentally measured moisture profiles well. During drying, transition from one water sub-population to another was smooth. The effective diffusion coefficient decreased with moisture content and increased with temperature, but did not follow Arrhenius\u2019 Law above 130\u00a0\u00b0C.",

It has been found that HP pasteurization does not affect to a significant extent any structural and functional property of the treated material relevant for food packaging applications. Conversely, HP sterilization promotes the hydrolysis of the material accompanied by an increase of crystallinity of the film and a decrease of density of the amorphous phase related to the temperature/pressure history. These effects determine an unacceptable embrittlement and opacification of the material that makes it unsuitable for HP sterilization applications.",

For impedance spectroscopy the equipment permits the generation of sinusoidal signals with a frequency in the range of 1\u00a0Hz to 1\u00a0MHz and programmable amplitude up to 1 Vpp. For voltammetry the IDM-1 equipment generates a sequence of up to 32 pulses with an amplitude that can be configured for each of the pulses in the range [\u22120.5; +0.5\u00a0V]. Voltammetric studies were performed using a total of eight working electrodes (i.e. Au, Pt, Ir, Rh, Ag, Cu, Ni, and Co) which were housed in a stainless steel cylinder used at the same time as both the body of the electronic tongue system and the counter/reference electrode. The width of the pulses can also be configured with a maximum value of 40\u00a0ms. The system consists of a software application that runs on a PC and electronic equipment. In order to test the capabilities of the designed system, impedometric and voltammetric measurements were carried out on five different commercial cola drinks (brands I\u2013V). Three different waveforms were used in the voltammetric study (i.e. staircase, ascendant SAPV and descendant SAPV). The voltammetric response and the impedance phase and module values obtained were processed using PCA. A remarkable discrimination between all cola drinks was seen using the descendant waveform and a group of metal electrodes (Ni, Co, Cu, Ag). In contrast, impedance spectroscopy technique discriminated one brand (brand I) from the others.",

The spray-dried powder was produced with the aid of maltodextrin (DE\u00a0=\u00a010). The chosen drying methods provided wide variations in residence time, from seconds (in SD) to over 30\u00a0h (in FD), and in product temperatures, from 20\u00a0\u00b0C (in FD) to 105\u00a0\u00b0C (in DD). The colors of RW-dried mango powder and reconstituted mango puree were comparable to the freeze-dried products, but were significantly different from drum-dried (darker), and spray-dried (lighter) counterparts. The bulk densities of drum and RW-dried mango powders were higher than freeze-dried and spray-dried powders. There were no significant differences (P\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a00.05) between RW and freeze-dried powders in terms of solubility and hygroscopicity. The glass transition temperature of RW-, freeze-, drum- and spray-dried mango powders were not significantly different (P\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a00.05). The dried powders exhibited amorphous structures as evidenced by the X-ray diffractograms. The microstructure of RW-dried mango powder was smooth and flaky with uniform thickness. Particles of freeze-dried mango powder were more porous compared to the other three products. Drum-dried material exhibited irregular morphology with sharp edges, while spray-dried mango powder had a spherical shape. The study concludes that RW drying can produce mango powder with quality comparable to that obtained via freeze drying, and better than the drum and spray-dried mango powders.",

The spatial and temporal experimental data of the liquid oil signal of the almond product and chocolate were modeled using a Fickian diffusion model. Solutions to the diffusion model were derived using both Laplace transform analytical solution and a finite difference numerical solution. For both methods, the boundary condition between the two layers incorporated a partition coefficient.

Using 1.5\u00a0bar atomizing air pressure, 37\u00a0\u00b0C processing temperature, and 15\u00a0min processing time provided optimal dehydration condition. Changing these values resulted in excessive stress on the cells and affected the cell viability. Next, we compared the impact on cell viability of fluidized-bed drying with that of freeze-drying. Fluidized-bed drying caused more substantial losses of cell viability. However, viability of cells pre-treated with membrane protective agents such as sucrose or skim milk was less affected by fluidized-bed drying than by freeze-drying, resulted in a minor degree of membrane damage after 2\u00a0months storage. Comparison of the flow characteristics of freeze-dried cells and fluidized-bed dried cells layered on spherical pellets showed the superior flowability of the latter.Thus, fluidized-bed technology might represent a feasible alternative for the dehydration of probiotics maintaining adequate viability and providing improved flowability for their processing into solid formulations.",

     "abstract": "Gluten plays a key role in determining the unique baking quality of wheat by conferring water absorption capacity, cohesivity, viscosity and elasticity of the dough. In spite of being relatively minor constituents, water-soluble pentosans (WSP) have the capacity to significantly affect the properties of dough and the final baked product. An understanding of their rheological properties in relation to their interaction would be therefore highly desirable in order to understand the physical and chemical mechanisms responsible for variations in bread making quality.Gluten and WSP were extracted from defatted whole wheat flour. Rheological behavior of the hydrated gluten\u2013WSP samples was studied using creep-recovery test and dynamic measurements. For gluten samples, the dynamic moduli increased with the increase in NaCl concentration. The WSP had significant impact on this behavior, hence strengthening the network at any ionic strength, as shown by the increase of storage (G\u2032) and loss (G\u2033) moduli. The gluten\u2013WSP samples were most strengthened when water level was 50%, which was determined by creep tests and oscillating measurement. The gluten\u2013WSP mixture was also less sensitive to the thermal treatment than the glutens alone, as shown by the lower magnitude of variation of G\u2032 and G\u2033 with temperature.",

However, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of phage\u2013bacteria interactions within a food matrix. To address this unmet need, the interactions of lytic bacteriophages with target model bacteria on the surface and interior (infiltrated) of a fresh produce were characterized using bioluminescence spectroscopy and imaging approaches. The results showed that the phages applied to the surface of lettuce leaves effectively reduced the level of bacterial targets that were present both on the surface and inside of lettuce leaves. However, there were significant differences in the initial rate of decrease of bacteria in the three model systems examined in this study: (a) homogenous well-mixed solution, (b) inoculated on the surface, and (c) infiltrated into the interior of lettuce leaves. The results also demonstrate the application of bioluminescence imaging for non-invasive measurement of interactions between bactericidal agents and target pathogens over an extended period of time in lettuce samples. The number of bacterial cells in lettuce samples before and after phage treatment predicted based on bioluminescence measurements was in agreement with the number calculated by conventional plate counting methods. In summary, the results highlight a non-invasive real-time imaging approach to quantitatively measure interactions of bacteriophages with both the surface inoculated and the infiltrated model bacterial cells in leafy greens.",

     "abstract": "A molecular dynamics (MD) modeling and simulations approach has been rationally built and developed to study porous food systems constructed with amylose and dextran chains. The findings from our MD studies indicate that the presence of food macromolecules decreases the energetics of the water\u2013water interactions for the nearby water molecules in the pore space, but provides additional water\u2013macromolecule interactions that can significantly outweigh the partial loss of water\u2013water interactions to make the adjacent water molecules strongly bound to the food macromolecules so that the water activity and water removal rate are decreased as dehydration proceeds and, thus, the dehydration energy requirement would be increased. The effects of pore structures are greater in systems with higher densities of food macromolecules, smaller in size pores, and stronger water\u2013macromolecule interactions. Dehydration of food materials can thus be reasonably expected to start from the largest pores and from the middle of the pores, and to have non-uniform water removal rates and non-planar water\u2013vapor interfaces inside individual pores as well as across sections of the food materials. The food porous structures are found to have good pore connectivity for water molecules. As dehydration proceeds, water content and the support from water\u2013water and water\u2013macromolecule interactions both decrease, causing the food porous structures to adopt more compact conformations and their main body to decrease in size. Dehydration in general also reduces pore sizes and the number of pore openings, increases the water\u2013macromolecule interactions, and leads to the reduction of the overall thermal conductivity of the system, so that more energy (heat), longer times, and/or greater temperature gradients are needed in order to further dehydrate the porous materials. Our thermodynamic analysis also shows that the average minimum entropy requirement for food dehydration is greater when the water\u2013macromolecule interactions are stronger and the food macromolecular density is higher. The importance of the physicochemical affinity of food molecules for water and of the compatibility of the resultant porous structures with water configurational structures in determining food properties and food processing through the water\u2013macromolecule interactions, is clearly and fundamentally verified by the results and discussion presented in this work.",

The results showed with increasing extrusion cooking temperature increasing number of force and number of sound peaks but decreasing maximum forces. Moreover the thickness of the cell wall decreased with increasing extrusion cooking temperature. All these trends were reversed with increasing feed moisture content.

A faster pretreatment method is needed.Previous studies have shown mass transfer enhancement during electrical treatment. We determined the effective diffusion coefficients, Dseff, of salt into vegetable (celery, mushroom, and water chestnut) tissue under electric field at three temperatures (25, 50, and 80\u00a0\u00b0C) and four electric field strengths (0, 658, 1316, and 1842\u00a0V/m).The value of Dseff was significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased with temperature and electric field strength for all materials (celery, mushroom, and water chestnut). Activation energies for diffusivity decreased with increasing electric field strength for celery and mushroom, suggesting a diminished role for temperature when field strength was high. No trend was found for water chestnut, implying that it was temperature insensitive. Although in an alternating field the electrophoretic driving force either aligns with or opposes diffusion during each half cycle, the net result is an increase in ion transport over time. This is consistent with the rectification theory as expressed by the Nernst\u2013Planck equation.",

Drying kinetics accomplished in a convective drying tunnel show that the overall mass transfer is controlled by internal migration of moisture within the starch particles. For a given inlet air temperature from 100 to 180\u00a0\u00b0C, the apparent diffusion coefficient derived from the drying curves increases exponentially with the instantaneous moisture content, with values ranging from 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211 to 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m2/s. Due to low diffusivity and the thin coat formed on the surface of solid carriers, the resistance to internal diffusion is negligible as compared to the overall mass transfer resistance when drying of starch dispersions takes place on inert solid carriers. Drying of yellow pea starch dispersion on Teflon particles as inert carriers was studied in laboratory and pilot fast spouted bed dryer for inlet air temperatures from 140 to 240\u00a0\u00b0C, and initial solid content of 38%, mass (d.b.).

     "abstract": "Tofu whey is a liquid by-product from tofu production. Although it contains oligosaccharides, proteins and isoflavones, which could be isolated and used as ingredients for functional products, it is currently not utilized but disposed as a waste stream. However, when disposed directly to the environment tofu whey can cause bad odours and pollution of the surface and ground water, so that treatment is necessary. The wastewater treatment of industrial tofu production by current technologies is problematic, because of the high expenses and the lack of knowledge about their efficient operation. Hence the need to use alternative technologies such as freeze concentrations. Falling-film freeze concentration tests of tofu whey were carried out on pilot-scale equipment in three stages. The increase in soluble solids content of the tofu whey and the amount and purity of the ice formed were analysed. It was observed that the concentration could be increased by a factor of 8 (from an initial concentration of 1.9\u00b0Brix to a final concentration of 15.5\u00b0Brix). The electrical conductivity of the tofu whey at the last stage was 6.48\u00a0mS/cm and the pH was 5.22. The process efficiency was 82.9% at the first stage but dropped to lower values at later stages. Falling film freeze concentration is a promising alternative to recover the solutes retained in the effluent from the tofu industry, reducing its volume and improving environmental management.",

The effect of protective agents (10% w/w) of lactose, sodium caseinate and lactose:sodium caseinate (3:1) was also evaluated. The thermal inactivation kinetics parameters in convective air drying and isothermal water bath heating were determined and compared. The results showed that the final temperature attained by the droplet affected the survival of the bacteria significantly, however, most of the bacterial death occurred in early stage of drying while evaporative cooling kept the drop temperature relatively low. At higher droplet temperatures (\u2a7e65\u00a0\u00b0C) the bacterial cultures were inactivated by both dehydration and thermal stresses. At lower droplet temperatures (\u2a7d55\u00a0\u00b0C) the rate of change in droplet moisture content had much stronger effect on the bacterial survival. Lactose and sodium caseinate, as protective agents, enhanced the survival of bacterial cells significantly at all the test conditions. The lactose:sodium caseinate (3:1) mixture synergistically enhanced the survival of the bacterial cultures. The death of these bacteria followed first-order kinetics during convective single droplet drying as well as during isothermal water-bath heating.

The region of interest (ROI) of the marbling standards and the pork samples was automatically determined for marbling extraction. Marblings were regarded as kind of line patterns and thereby extracted by the wide line detector. Proportion of marblings (PM) was used for determinating the marbling score. The stepwise procedure was employed to select prediction models. A multiple linear regression equation was used as the initial model of the procedure and the PM of marbling standards at all three channels as potential variables. Three models were developed by the stepwise procedure with different first entry variable of the initial model. The multiple linear model obtained by the PM of marbling standards at all three RGB channels outperformed the two simple linear models respectively developed at the green and blue channels. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) of the multiple linear model was 0.9992 and the root mean square error of leave-one-out cross-validation (RMSECV) was 0.0938. Forty pork loin samples were used to predict marbling scores.

     "abstract": "The agglomeration phenomenon of amorphous particulate material is a major problem in the food industry. Currently, the glass transition temperature (Tg) is used as a fundamental parameter to describe and control agglomeration. Models are available that describe the kinetics of the agglomeration process as a function of the distance of the material from Tg (i.e. T\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Tg). In practice these models are often not applied because they assume that the powder material is instantly in equilibrium with the humidity conditions of the environment and that solid mobility only occurs at T\u00a0>\u00a0Tg. Insights in the kinetics and mechanisms of water transport in powder material can help to better understand and control powder agglomeration. For this purpose, gravimetric step-change water sorption experiments were performed on maltodextrins as a function of the water activity aw. The maltodextrins vary in dextrose equivalents (DE), particle size and morphology. The experimental results were compared with a Fickian diffusion model in order to understand the dependency of the transport mechanism on water concentration gradient and material relaxation. The water transport kinetics in the maltodextrins with low DE (i.e. 6) were well described by Fickian diffusion for low aw, independently of particle size and morphology, until relaxation phenomena started to occur at an aw corresponding to T\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Tg\u00a0=\u00a0\u221220\u00a0\u00b0C. The importance of the matrix relaxation phenomena on the water transport mechanism increased with increasing DE (i.e. 29 and 32), not showing any relationship with the Tg. The results of this study indicate that the water migration mechanism is controlled by relaxation phenomena when the amorphous material is still far from the glass\u2013rubber transition. The T\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Tg at which the relaxation phenomena occur depends on the material. On the contrary, the T\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Tg parameter could well describe the onset of agglomeration, independently from the material properties. Therefore, it can be concluded that within the conditions of this study, matrix relaxation occurring far below Tg did not affect the onset of agglomeration.",

The analysis was carried out by means of manual laboratory operations reproducing the three processes. The primary objective of this study was the evaluation of the minimum amount of ascorbic acid that must be added to the three fruit purees in order to contain oxidization and color change in the products. Afterwards, the residual enzymatic activity was checked and characteristics of the products were compared (i.e. fraction of dried solids and consistency of the puree). All of the processes achieved complete enzyme deactivation and an imperceptible color change, and the results of this paper support interest in vacuum puree extraction technology.",

The gelation process was monitored in situ through dynamic oscillatory measurements, under different thermal profile conditions. Increasing temperature (70\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C, 5\u00a0min) resulted in more structured gels, while the effect of time (5\u201330\u00a0min, at 90\u00a0\u00b0C) was less pronounced. The effect of heating and cooling rates on gel setting was also studied. Haematococcus gels were highly structured and less dependent on gel setting conditions. Spirulina gels presented lower values of viscoelastic functions than the control (gel matrix without microalgae), but this was overcome when using lower heating/cooling rates.",

Afterwards, the unit costs of the frozen product chain were calculated, from the purchase of raw materials to the distribution and in shop storage of the end product. These unit costs were then assumed for the ohmic product, so as to achieve a maximum PTC of its treatment and packaging equal to 1.42306\u00a0\u20ac/kg.

An appropriate description of the microstructure of the raw material and its evolution during processing has been evidenced as critical in order to better understand and describe osmotic dehydration processes; as a direct consequence, it is stated that predictive models should incorporate this microstructural information so as to be more reliable. Microstructural changes observed by examining the isolated cells under the microscope along the treatments have been used to identify critical points that separate the stages that a cell undergoes, and which depend also on its particular response to the osmotic treatment (lysis, shrinkage or complete plasmolysis). Irreversible thermodynamics has been used to mathematically describe the process by distinguishing two main stages: one at which significant deformation\u2013relaxation phenomena are coupled with mass transfer, and another one at which the former may be neglected.",

The shelf-life of strawberries treated with VI\u2013OH at 13\u00a0V/cm and stored at 5\u00a0\u00b0C was extended from 12 d (control samples) to 25 d.

Meanwhile to achieve adequate inactivation of thermo-resistant strains, spores or biofilms the higher Na-Chl concentration and longer illumination times had to be used. Comparison of different surface decontamination treatments reveal that photosensitization is much more effective against B. cereus and L. monocytogenes attached on the surface than washing with water or 200\u00a0ppm Na-hypochlorite.Our data support the idea that photosensitization may serve in the future for the development of human and environment friendly, non-thermal surface decontamination technique.",

     "publication date": "05-2012",
     "abstract": "Antimicrobial active packaging is a novel technology in which a chemical compound (or mixture) is purposely incorporated into a packaging material to be released into the food to protect it from deterioration. The effectiveness of an antimicrobial package is strongly related to the balance between the controlled release of the active compound and microbial growth kinetics. This work characterizes and models the release of carvacrol from an EVOH coating on a PP film which can be employed as an active packaging system. The kinetics and extent of carvacrol mass transport within the packaging components were fully characterized as a function of relative humidity. As expected, water uptake by the EVOH coating acts as a triggering mechanism for activity. The partition equilibrium for carvacrol in the complex film largely favors (10,000-fold) the EVOH layer in dry conditions, although in humid conditions the solubility in both polymers is very close (4-fold). Kinetically, the presence of humidity increases the value of D for carvacrol in EVOH from 3\u00a0\u00b7\u00a010\u221219\u00a0m2/s in dry conditions to 3\u00a0\u00b7\u00a010\u221215\u00a0m2/s in a wet environment.After the experimental characterization of carvacrol transport, the efficiency of the release of carvacrol was estimated with a novel mathematical model based on the finite element method and successfully compared with the evolution of carvacrol concentration in a real packaging system. The model developed can be employed in the optimization of package design in order to ensure the maintenance of a specific concentration of the active agent in the headspace, high enough to prevent potential growth of a particular foodborne spoiling or pathogenic microorganism on the preserved foodstuffs. This model could easily be extended to similar packaging systems as long as an inventory of experimental data for all the parameters and coefficients involved is available, sufficiently complete to fulfill all the mathematical requirements demanded by the model.",

For this experimental data more than 50% of the Campylobacter are inactivated on surfaces of the chickens.

In this work we have evaluated the capacity of ozone, a strong oxidant declared as a GRAS additive, to remove greasy stains from hard surfaces. Firstly we studied the effect of ozone on a model alimentary fat, pork lard, and several detergent components: three surfactants, and a lipase. Finally washing experiments where conducted in a continuous flow device which simulates an industrial clean-in-place system, in order to establish a suitable strategy for cleaning processes involving ozone. Ozonation of pork lard in aqueous medium led to the formation of surface active molecules, presumably fatty acids, which resulted in a slight but significant improvement of washing performance compared to that of water. The three surfactants tested retained all or part of their surface activity for short ozonation times, and the inclusion of ozone did not affect their washing efficiency significantly, even under alkaline conditions. Conversely enzyme residues were readily deactivated by rinsing with ozonated water, which helps to prevent food contamination.",

The effect of composition on the extrusion parameters was investigated and specific mechanical energy (SME) was measured as an indication of extrusion processability, thus providing good characterization of the extrusion process in order to make it highly energy efficient and cost effective. Water content was the most important factor on the extrusion parameters and product properties. The incorporation of gelatin increased SME and the product obtained at the extruder die was not continuous. However, when lactose was added, SME decreased and the color of the product changed due to Maillard reaction. This reaction could be analyzed by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) where the changes of the amide I and amide II bands reflected that hydroxyl groups in sugars and amino groups in soy protein isolate (SPI) were consumed during extrusion. These results are in good agreement with total soluble matter (TSM) values, which were lower for mixtures with lactose than sucrose due to a higher degree of Maillard reaction. Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results also showed the influence of Maillard reaction, which lead to more ordered and compact structures, respectively.",

A novel analytical solution to the heat transfer problem in a hemispherical shell has been developed using the shifted Legendre functions.

To minimize errors the natural shape of the food was taken into account. Neither the values nor the solution have been reported to-date.The values of heat transfer coefficients (h) and thermal conductivities (k) were found to be 17\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0h2\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a036, 4.0\u00a0\u2a7d h 2 \u2217 \u2a7d11 and 7.0\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0h1\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a015, 1.2\u00a0\u2a7d h 1 \u2217 \u2a7d3.0\u00a0W/m2\u00a0\u00b0C for the outer and inner surfaces, and 0.125\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0k\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a00.127 and 0.030\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0k\u2217\u2a7d0.020\u00a0W/m\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The maximum temperature occurred at the outer equatorial surface and the minimum at the middle near to the pole.In the future these thermal parameters can be used to develop coconut dryers with improved energy efficiency and the method can be used to determine parameters for foods of similar shape.",

The relationship of entanglement concentration (Ce) of zein solution and its electrospinnability was inspected to determine the correlation of fiber morphology with the rheology of solutions. Bead-free and uniform zein electrospun fibers were successfully constructed. Response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized to facilitate a more systematic understanding of the electrospinning parameters of zein solutions. The electrospinning parameters studied were concentration of zein solution, solution feed rate, applied voltage and distance between needle tip and collector. The individual and interaction effects between the parameters on average diameter of the electrospun fibers were determined using Box and Behnken factorial design. The interaction effect between feed rate and voltage, the quadratic coefficients of the applied voltage as well as linear coefficients of the solution concentration, voltage and feed rate were found statistically significant in the fabrication of sub-micron fibers. Hence, this work provides an overview on the impact of solution and processing parameters to the fabrication of zein electrospun fibers which may find uses as nanostructured materials in food industry.",

The main objective of this paper is to study the influence of different HPH treatments on the structure of a sauce (an egg/dairy emulsion), in order to obtain the higher physicochemical stability. The oil-in-water emulsion was stable up to 100\u00a0MPa with the oil droplets surrounded by several layers of natural emulsifiers. Critical pressures, between 150 and 250\u00a0MPa, produced a destabilization of the emulsion thus causing a separation of phases. A coalescence phenomenon progressively occurred when pressure increased. This phenomenon was due to the loss of the natural emulsifier barrier. Changes on the electrophoretic pattern were also observed at high pressure levels, showing an insolubilization of proteins. Lipid fraction was observed to be chemically stable after the HPH treatment.",

The study found that the model based on the spectra de-noised by Daubechies 6 wavelet (db6) at decomposition level 6, soft thresholding strategy and minimaxi threshold estimator gave reasonable performance (r\u00a0>\u00a00.900, root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC)\u00a0=\u00a00.100, cross validation (RMSECV)\u00a0=\u00a00.139 and prediction (RMSEP)\u00a0=\u00a00.125).

POX was the more heat resistant enzyme. The 90% destruction (D value) of the activity of both enzymes could be achieved only at 200\u00a0W within the 5\u00a0min frame employed for the tests.When the samples were immersed in water and both the food sample and the water were submitted to MW exposure at 250\u2013450\u00a0W or variable power with a maximum at 935\u00a0W, shrinking was avoided. The D value at 90\u00a0\u00b0C (reference; D T ref ) and z could be determined after time\u2013temperature corrections, and it was observed that, in general, D T ref values for POX were smaller than for PPO. The microwave treatment (maximum power: 935\u00a0W) designed to provide a similar temperature profile to the one observed for traditional blanching (immersion in water at 90\u00a0\u00b0C), showed the smallest D T ref value for POX inactivation.

     "publication date": "04-2012",
     "abstract": "Molecular-level understanding of solid-phase crystallization growth kinetics has the potential to improve the fundamental basis for understanding this process. This understanding has been developed here as part of an activated-state model, which accounts for the effects of the moisture content and the temperature on the crystallization rate. Water-induced crystallization (WIC) at different temperatures (15\u00a0\u00b0C, 25\u00a0\u00b0C, 40\u00a0\u00b0C) and a constant relative humidity (75%) environment has been used to analyze the changes in enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy of activation for the solid-phase crystallization of lactose. WIC showed that, at higher temperatures, crystallization commences at lower moisture contents. The enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of activation increased during the crystallization process, which suggested that the binding energy needed for the formation of an activated complex increased as the moisture content decreased, making the formation of the activated complex more difficult. The entropy of activation, on the other hand, decreased with the decrease in the moisture content. From the activated rate equation, the energy of activation has been estimated to be 39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121, which is similar to the literature value (40\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121) for the solid-phase crystallization of lactose. The reaction rate constant at 25\u00a0\u00b0C is 1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0s\u22121, which is similar to the literature value of 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0s\u22121.

Activation energy curves obtained here were compared with previous data from lower initial concentrations, as well as the plot obtained using a preliminary desorption method.

The effect that lipid addition had on the gas and water vapor permeability was dependent both on the composition of oleic acid\u2013beeswax mixtures and the film\u2019s moisture content. The addition of lipid mixtures reduced water vapor transfer as compared to the control films (without lipid), whereas pure oleic acid or beeswax were less effective. Both control films and films prepared with pure beeswax showed the lowest O2 and CO2 permeability, whereas the incorporation of oleic acid exponentially increased these values. A linear increase in water vapor and gas permeability was observed when the water content of the film rose, due to its plasticizing effect, which led to an increase in the molecular mobility. Predictive equations for water vapor permeability (WVP) and gas permeability were established as a function of water content and lipid composition.",

     "abstract": "The study aim was to investigate the vacuum impregnation (VI) technique for apple enrichment with quercetin glycosides from apple peel. Beside the determination of the quercetin content, structural effects on the apple parenchyma were analyzed by computerized microtomography (\u03bcCT). VI was an efficient method to enrich apples with quercetin derivatives which was affected by the apple cultivar, the vacuum pressure, the soluble solid concentration (SSC) and the viscosity of VI solution. After VI of 13 apple cultivars the quercetin content varied between 368 and 604\u00a0\u03bcg/g dry mass and correlated with the firmness of the native apple and the increased apple weight. The use of low SSC solution resulted in increased quercetin enrichment in contrast to apple pectin solutions with elevated viscosity. The \u03bcCT analyses demonstrate that VI was more effective in the inner apple sections than in the outer parts. The study indicates that differences of pore size and microstructure within the apple cortex substantially affected the enrichment process.",

This study aimed to evaluate an alternative to the venting process with a reduction in steam energy expenditure. A system was adapted and instrumented, which allowed for the study of the phenomenon of venting using water for the air displacement. The alternative methodology proposed was shown to be promising and efficient for an empty retort with no load.

     "abstract": "Addition of wheat bran reduces the expansion volumes of extruded cereals. This may be explained by the influence wheat bran has on the elastic properties of the melt. The elastic properties of extruded refined wheat flour supplemented with wheat bran were investigated using a complementary on-line and an off-line rheological technique. The Bagley pressure (end pressure), reflecting extensional properties of the melt, was measured on-line using the orifice die method (dies with different lengths). The storage modulus of the extruded samples was measured using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Increasing the bran concentration to an intermediate level significantly increased the Bagley pressure likely due to a reduced mobility of starch molecules. Further increasing the bran concentration significantly decreased the Bagley pressure. This might be caused by physical rupture of the melt at the die exit due to the low adhesion properties between starch and bran particles. This change in Bagley pressure indicates that the elastic properties of the composite melt may be reduced by bran particles. The storage modulus measured by DMTA was decreased when increasing the bran concentration, further supporting a potential decrease of the elastic properties of the melt with bran.",

The results show that murta leaves extract did not affect the contact angle and wettability measured on the fruits surface. However, differences were obtained between apple and quince skin which can be explained because the dispersive component of surface tension of quince skin was lower than apple skin. The WVP was not affected by murta leaves extract incorporation. This allows concluding that the film properties assayed were not modified by the incorporation of murta leaves extract ecotype 14-4.",

     "abstract": "Optical devices are being increasingly used for more accurate and faster ways to investigate quality parameters of agricultural products. The main task of this research is to evaluate the use of a CCD camera in combination with laser diodes emitting at 532\u00a0nm and 635\u00a0nm to monitor changes in moisture content of red, yellow and green bell pepper during drying. Moreover, the feasibility of using the CCD camera alone to analyze color changes during drying, in alternative to the colorimeter, is assessed. Results showed that scattering area and light intensity were able to predict moisture content changes of bell pepper during drying. While excellent correlations were obtained for yellow colored samples (R\u00a0=\u00a00.93 and RMSEP\u00a0=\u00a07.28), the behavior of green and red wavelengths in peppers with red and green color, respectively, may raise some doubt on the ability to predict moisture content (R\u00a0=\u00a00.33 and RMSEP\u00a0>\u00a022). Additionally, light scattering varied according to the different depths on the surface where the images were taken. Furthermore, it was concluded that a change in tissue structure during drying may have caused dispersion of photons through the surface resulting in varying degrees of scattering. The presented technique based on a digital camera and laser diodes shows the potential to be applied in the future as a fast and modern method for in-line measurements of monitoring moisture content during drying. Digital images in terms of RGB values have been demonstrated to be a promising alternative to monitor changes of L\u2217 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.87 and R\u00a0=\u00a00.90), and a\u2217 values (R\u00a0=\u00a00.93 and R\u00a0=\u00a00.97), during drying of yellow and green pepper.

Samples showed different viscoelastic properties, ranging from fluid-like to weak gel behaviour.

The sample with only whey protein obeyed the Cox\u2013Merz rule, while in the rest of the samples complex viscosity was higher than apparent viscosity.

     "abstract": "A new approach for the non-invasive classification of raisins is presented based on the hybrid image features, namely morphological, color and texture features. A total of 74 features (8 morphological, 30 color, and 36 textural) were extracted from RBG images. Seven kinds of models were established based on different feature sets. They were three kinds of models established based on single feature set, three kinds of models established based on the combination of two feature sets, and one kind of model established based on the combination of all feature sets. Five kinds of classifiers, namely partial least squares (PLS), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels were used for the model establishment based on different feature sets. The best correct answer rates (CAR) of 99% was obtained when LDA was used to establish the classification model based on the combination of all feature sets, which was higher than those of the models established based on single feature set or the combination of two feature sets. The results show that the feature combination is helpful to improve the accuracy of raisin classification. It was concluded that the varieties of raisin could be accurately classified based on RGB image features and the combination of morphological, color and texture features was an accurate way to improve the accuracy of classification.",

Two types of dough were studied (to estimate dough shelf life): simple yeasted dough (SY) and double yeasted dough (DY). Fermentative activity (yeast viability, gassing power, and dough volume), rheological and textural parameters were assessed for frozen sweet doughs.These effects were explored by different and complementary methods: Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), dynamic rheology, texture profile analysis (TPA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).The data showed that the longer the frozen storage time at \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C, the higher the decreased of frozen sweet dough quality. The rheological attributes such as hardness, \u0394S, springiness, tan\u00a0\u03b4 and yeast activity declined significantly during frozen storage. This modification led to lower specific volume of frozen sweet dough during proofing.The observed changes of the frozen sweet doughs rheological properties after thawing may be attributed to the damage on the gluten cross-linking, mainly produced by the ice crystallization during frozen storage. The storage effect was particularly concentrated in the first 27\u00a0days of storage.",

STDs of different concentrations were prepared by mixing corn starch powder with distilled water at 90\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Each of the partially gelatinized STDs thus prepared was filled in retort pouches and processed in a retort under various combinations of holding temperature, holding time, and rotational speed. Thermocouples were inserted into selected pouches one by one to monitor the cold spot temperature at regular intervals. The profiles of cold spot temperature together with retort temperature thus obtained were served to ANN modeling as training or validation data. Back-propagation network was chosen as the network model. Input variables for the model were current and past temperatures of the cold spot (Tn, Tn\u22121, and Tn\u22122) and current retort temperature \u03b8n and current time tn. Output was the temperature of the cold spot at the next time step Tn+1. A model with 2 hidden layers, which contained 11 and 15 nodes, respectively, was the best among the models tested. Using the model developed, prediction of a whole profile of the cold spot temperature was tested, starting from temperature data of the first three time steps with a whole profile of retort temperature monitored. The results showed very good performance of the model, relative errors for F0 value prediction being less than 2%.",

During drying, the evolution of the grain moisture content is fitted using the analytical solution of Fick equation developed by Crank (1979) for spherical material. The decrease of extractible salt-soluble protein during heating is forecasted using a first and a second order ordinary differential equation. It was found that temperature; moisture content and time of processing greatly influence the kinetic denaturation of SSP of corn kernels. The evolution of extractible SSP content of corn kernels during drying at high temperature is more correctly described with second order kinetic than with the first order kinetic reaction. The Hunterlab color parameters of corn also vary during drying. Lightness and color intensity decrease while yellowness, redness, chroma and hue angle increase through drying time. Most of these Hunterlab color parameters are highly correlated with the salt-soluble proteins content and therefore could be used as indicators of excessive heat treatment and denaturation of salt-soluble proteins in corn kernels.",

It was found that the gelatinized crosslinked tapioca starch at 1\u20138%\u00a0w/w in aqueous solutions behaved as swollen granules with the low-shear viscosity described by Krieger & Dougherty equation. To achieve thickening performance, 3.5%\u00a0w/w starch was cooked with a range of 0.5%\u00a0w/w polysaccharides, i.e. konjac glucomannan, guar gum, xanthan gum, and their 50:50 mixtures. It was shown that additions of polysaccharides greatly affected the rheological behavior of the suspensions, predominantly in the linear viscoelastic regime. The studied mixtures of starch and polysaccharides exhibited strong synergistic effects as evidenced from the increase in their consistency coefficients and the excess storage moduli calculated from the Palierne equation. Moreover, the mixtures containing xanthan gum showed weak-gel characteristics while the others demonstrated liquid-like behavior. In the non-linear viscoelastic analysis, arrangement of starch granules and specific interfacial interactions evidently affected the deformation behavior of the mixtures of crosslinked tapioca starch and polysaccharide. The mixture of konjac glucomannan and xanthan also largely improved stress susceptibility of the suspension and gave the unique shear stiffening under large amplitude oscillatory shear experiment.",

     "abstract": "In the manufacturing process of pasta or couscous, durum wheat semolina agglomeration comprises successive steps, in particular a wetting and hydration stage. In this step, interactions between water molecules and semolina grains contribute to the agglomeration properties. Hydration properties of semolina have been recognised to play an important role in agglomeration.The hydration properties of semolina have been characterised using various methods which can be divided into 2 groups according to the water addition: liquid or vapour. Several parameters can be used to describe hydration properties and hydration mechanisms, such as: water sorption capacity, hydration kinetics, diffusion of water within the solid (swelling, dissolution, solid\u2013water affinity and thermodynamic properties).In this study, sorption isotherms and diffusion coefficients have been determined by gravimetric method in specific conditions. The immersion enthalpy of the semolina and its main sub-components, starch and gluten have been measured by mixing micro-calorimetry. Hydration thermodynamic properties, Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy, were calculated from these experimental data. It was found that hydration by vapour or liquid water is an exothermic reaction.The determined diffusion coefficient was used to estimate the stabilisation time of water within the solid. Being high at low relative humidity, the diffusion coefficient decreases during progressive saturation of solid sites. Sorption energy and solid\u2013water affinity yield information about the type of interaction between water molecules and solid sites. The drop in the sorption energy during the increase in water content can be attributed to a decrease in solid\u2013water interactions. The hydration energy of durum wheat semolina in vapour or liquid water was found to be low. This corresponds to the energy input needed to generate contact between water and grain surface and for mixture homogenisation.",

The test results revealed that rehydrated sea cucumber has much lower relative dielectric loss factor (9.73\u20135.62) than muscle foods, including salmon fillets and sliced beef, which were reported in the literature. The whey protein gel formulations that had been developed in our laboratory as a tool in heating pattern studies for those products are, therefore, not appropriate for sea cucumber. Adding 1.0% gellan powder sharply reduced the amount of whey protein concentrates needed to form firm gels and significantly lowered the dielectric loss factor.

     "abstract": "The retail of food produces a large amount of carbon, both directly through embodied energy in the food and its packaging, and indirectly through energy use. Supermarkets are large consumers of energy in the UK, accounting for up to 5% of the UK\u2019s total consumption. A large proportion of this energy, up to 50%, is used in refrigeration of food and much of this is used to cool open type display cabinets. However, work at Unilever Research Laboratory in the 1970s indicated that the input energy required for cooling open display refrigerated cabinets could be substantially reduced by applying low emissivity (i.e. high reflectance) materials in food packaging, causing the cabinet heat load and the temperatures of stored foods to be reduced. One drawback was that it was difficult to print on the surface of these materials without reducing their reflective properties. However, subsequent developments in packaging technology and the use of modern manufacturing processes have overcome the earlier disadvantages of these materials, permitting printing onto the external surfaces of low emissivity packaging, while still retaining its reflective properties. This paper presents an update of the Unilever study, in terms of the potential of modern, low emissivity food packaging materials for improving refrigeration system efficiency. The results of the new study indicate that some types of packaging will allow an increase in refrigerator operating temperature of up to 10\u00a0K, with no loss of refrigeration performance with respect to the food. This is expected to result in improved refrigeration system efficiency, with reductions of up to 30% in both energy consumption and carbon emissions and a likely significant increase in shelf life for stored foods. In addition, the embodied carbon for the packaging and the life cycle impact of its use, have been evaluated. Packaging having low embodied energy content has been identified, and it has been predicted that significant net savings in both carbon and energy are possible over the life cycle.",

     "abstract": "The current research has produced an accurate model of the non-nucleating seeded batch crystallization of glucose monohydrate which includes complex phenomena including crystal growth rate dispersion and the effect of the mutarotation reaction. The model is able to predict the population density of crystals in the batch as a function of particle size and batch time, n = n ( L , t ) as well as total glucose concentration in the mother liquor and the fraction of glucose in the \u03b1-d-glucopyranose form. A previous model of similar systems was limited by considering only systems with monosize seed crystals, and where growth rate dispersion had a negligible effect on the particle size distribution. Because of the nature of the \u2018common history\u2019 crystals that are produced by the growth of glucose monohydrate, the modifications required to the model to account for these additions to the model are remarkably simple. By predicting the full population density the model produces an accurate mass balance for the crystallization process, since the second moment of the crystal size distribution (CSD) may be calculated analytically at every point in the simulation. This enables the competitive kinetics between the rate of crystal mass deposition of \u03b1-glucose and the rate of production of \u03b1-glucose via the mutarotation reaction to be more accurately accounted for, and hence the significance of the mutarotation reaction on the crystal growth to be more accurately predicted.",

     "abstract": "This work examined the effect of the solid matrix on supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2) extraction of essentials oils from boldo leaves (Peumus boldus M.) subjected to rapid decompression of a CO2-impregnated sample, conventional milling, and low-temperature milling. Low-temperature conditioning prior to milling decreased heat-driven losses of volatile compounds during milling, as attested by a higher extract yield for low-temperature (10.8\u00a0g extract/kg extract-free substrate) than conventionally (9.63\u00a0g/kg) milled sample. Extract yield was even larger for the rapidly decompressed sample (11.4\u00a0g/kg). Results of SC CO2 extraction experiments carried out at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u00a0MPa were adjusted to a diffusional model using the effective diffusivity of the extract in the solid matrix (De) and a single partition of essential oils between solid substrate and SC CO2 as best-fitting parameters. A microstructural factor (FM), which was estimated as the ratio between the binary diffusion coefficient of the essential oil in SC-CO2 under extraction conditions and De, was used to characterize the effect of sample pretreatment on extraction rates. Values of FM for rapidly decompressed (202) and low-temperature milled (1740) samples were smaller than value for conventionally milled samples (2200), which revealed that the two first treatments disrupted secretory cavities in boldo leaves more effectively than the third. This was confirmed by light microscopy observations. The work included also measurements using oregano bracts (Origanum vulgare L.) as the substrate to confirm literature reports on the SC CO2 extraction of pretreated bracts and to serve as a reference to our main results with boldo leaves. Trends with oregano coincided with those of boldo.",

Comparing to conventional fish oil extraction processes such as cold extraction, wet reduction or enzymatic extraction, supercritical fluid extraction with carbon dioxide under moderate conditions (25\u00a0MPa and 313\u00a0K) may be useful for reducing fish oil oxidation, especially when fish oil is rich in omega-3 such as salmon oil, and the amount of certain impurities, such as some species of arsenic. Furthermore, taking profit of the advantages of supercritical carbon dioxide as extractive solvent, a coupled extraction-fractionation process is proposed as a way to remove free fatty acids and improve fish oil quality, alternatively to physical and chemical refining procedures.",

The aim of the current paper is to address this uncertainty challenge in the modelling of food production processes using a combination of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, where the uncertainty analysis and global sensitivity analysis were applied to a heat and mass transfer model of a contact baking process. The Monte Carlo procedure was applied for propagating uncertainty in the input parameters to uncertainty in the model predictions. Monte Carlo simulations and the least squares method were used in the sensitivity analysis: for each model output, a linear regression model was constructed and the standardized regression coefficients (SRCs) and R2 were computed. The effect of input parameters on model predictions was calculated, and the relative impact of the parameters on each of the outputs was ranked. Results of the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can be used to prioritize future experimental efforts, as discussed for the contact baking process.",

In this article, the effect of processing on the spoilage inactivation was evaluated after processing and during the storage trial.

The morphological characteristics of the sample, including the characteristics of each cellular void and the open pore connections between them are determined from X-ray micro-tomography (XRT) data by means of 3D image analysis techniques. The 3D network allows to simulate the water vapor transport between the air cells through the open pores and the local sorption kinetics in the lamellae that separate them. In this way realistic moisture ingress profiles can be simulated in complex morphologies without need of unknown effective parameters. It is shown that the fine structure related transport characteristics embedded in the cell discretized network can be volume averaged to obtain a steady state relative vapor conductivity and a quasi-steady-state sorption time constant. These essential morphology related parameters can be used for an equivalent continuous two-equation description for a homogeneous product.",

     "abstract": "Experimental dynamical moisture profiles of crackers with a fine and coarse morphology are successfully predicted using a pore scale network model. Experimental profiles are obtained using a single point imaging (SPI) NMR technique that enables 3D mapping of the moisture content of relatively immobile water at low water activity.The relative vapor conductivity trough the structure is 33% and 64% for the fine and coarse structured crackers, respectively. It can be argued that this is due to their difference in cell connectivity and not directly related to their difference in average cell diameter (0.33 and 0.75\u00a0mm, respectively). It was found that the retarded local sorption dynamics of the solid matrix has a noticeable influence on the moisture profiles that arise in the first hours. This is crucial for the moisture sorption dynamics of sub centimeter size samples, for which there is a distinct non-equilibrium between the vapor and the sorbed water phase. The local sorption at low water activity is a factor 3 faster for the fine structure cracker compared to the coarse one. This is due to their differences in average lamellae thickness (54 and 93\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively).However, for the description of the overall moisture sorption dynamics of the few cm thick samples, on a time scale of days, it valid to assume local equilibrium and to use an effective diffusivity model. The relative vapor conductivity together with the porosity and the derivative of the sorption isotherm determines the effective moisture diffusivity for these open structures, which is a factor 3 lower for the fine structured cracker compared to the coarse one. The single sided moisture sorption in the 2.5 thick cracker samples is not even completed after 5\u00a0days, mainly because at higher water content (near 20%) there is very little gradient in relative humidity to drive the vapor transport. This is reflected in the predicted effective moisture diffusivities which for the coarse cracker decrease from 16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m/s2 (at 1% MC, 16% aw) to 7.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0m/s2 (at 20% MC, 86% aw).",

The resulting PDAEs were converted to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations using the centered finite difference approximation (CFDM) and were implemented into the optimization environment GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System). Thus, the temperature profiles in the center and surface of the candy, air cooling temperature and velocity are simultaneously optimized. Three objectives functions based on the product quality are proposed. A sensitive analysis on the main model parameters was also made. The obtained results are discussed in detail.

Principal component analysis conducted on the spectra of the healthy and sour skin-infected onions suggested that the neck area of the onion at two wavelengths (1070 and 1400\u00a0nm) was most indicative of the sour skin. Log-ratio images utilizing the two optimal wavelengths were used for two different image analysis approaches.

The SDA features a cooled, removable heat transfer surface with well defined heat and mass transfer characteristics. Measurements of heat flux were combined with computational fluid dynamics simulations to yield reliable estimates of the surface temperature and shear stress. Fouling studies were performed with model solutions of 5\u00a0wt.% tripalmitin in a paraffin oil operating in the \u2018cold start\u2019 mode, wherein the experiment starts with the surface colder than the steady state, simulating one mode of operating a standard \u2018cold finger\u2019 experiment. Local heat flux measurements allowed the thermal fouling resistance to be monitored: deposit mass coverage and composition were also measured. The cold surface promotes the rapid formation of an initial gel layer, followed by a period of linear fouling, and finally falling rate fouling behaviour. The linear fouling rate was relatively insensitive to temperature and shear rate, while the fouling rate in the falling rate regime was found to depend on the temperature driving force for crystallisation kinetics. The solids fraction within the deposit layer increased over the duration of a 12\u00a0h fouling test, indicating rapid ageing. The rheological properties of the deposits were highly sensitive to solids fraction.",

With the wide availability of cell phones and other camera-ready mobile devices, food pictures can be taken, stored or transmitted easily to form an image based dietary record. Although this record enables a more accurate dietary recall, a digital image of food usually cannot be used to estimate portion size directly due to the lack of information about the scale and orientation of the food within the image. The objective of this study is to investigate two novel approaches to provide the missing information, enabling food volume estimation from a single image. Both approaches are based on an elliptical reference pattern, such as the image of a circular pattern (e.g., circular plate) or a projected elliptical spotlight. Using this reference pattern and image processing techniques, the location and orientation of food objects and their volumes are calculated. Experiments were performed to validate our methods using a variety of objects, including regularly shaped objects and food samples.",

However, mangosteens are judged as translucent when the translucent flesh is visible on the pulp surface regardless of the quantity of the internal translucent flesh which may result in some mangosteen assessed as normal having the same amount of translucent flesh content as a mangosteen judged as translucent. The critical amount of translucent flesh to be visible on the pulp surface needs to be determined for assessment purposes. A non-destructive technique to measure the translucent content is a practical tool as the first step towards the establishment of the critical value.A non-destructive model was developed to estimate the translucent content in mangosteens using near infrared transmittance. The translucent area of the flesh section on the fruit surface was used to indicate the translucent content. The effects of the orientation of the fruit and also of the light source to the relative position of the detector as well as the effect of the measurement position of the fruit on the predictive performance were examined. The results showed that the best partial least squares model was achieved with spectra acquired from the fruit position which revealed the largest flesh segment (prediction correlation coefficient was 0.86 and root mean square error of prediction was 7.58%).

The aim of this work was to determine if it would be possible to develop a generalized indicator that could be used to monitor microstructural changes of a model food product (carrot cubes) undergoing three different drying methods, i.e., hot air drying, vacuum drying and low-pressure superheated steam drying. Two types of indicators, i.e., normalized change of the fractal dimension (\u0394FD/FD0) of the sample microstructure and normalized change of the average sample cell diameter ( \u0394 D \u00af / D 0 \u00af ), were tested. Further investigation was made to determine if the tested indicators could be used to correlate the microstructural changes to apparent physical characteristic changes (shrinkage and hardness). It was found that both \u0394FD/FD0 and \u0394 D \u00af / D 0 \u00af increased with a decrease in the product moisture content, corresponding to an increase in the irregularity of the sample microstructure and a decrease in the sample cell volume; the relationships between the changes of these indicators and product moisture content were similar among all the tested drying methods and conditions.

A microscopic analysis confirmed also the differences in the surface morphology showing the most rough surface of E 1422 starch. Despite broad variations in the diameter of individual starch granules, it was found that differently sized ridges and valleys on granule surface reflect porosity and water sorption values of the examined starches.",

Banana processed by CMFD had a moisture content of 0.293\u00a0g/g (dry basis) and aw\u00a0=\u00a00.272 after 3\u00a0h of processing. Mango had a moisture content of 0.09\u00a0g/g and aw\u00a0=\u00a00.359 after 4\u00a0h of processing. Puncture tests on fruits dehydrated by CMFD and on commercial freeze-dried fruits showed strain\u2013force curves with many peaks (jagged curves). For CMFD much smaller global shrinkage was observed.

     "publication date": "02-2012",
     "abstract": "In the present study, dimensional analysis has been developed in order to identify the ratios governing the foam development network, with mixers combining dual whip revolution speeds. It is first suggested that, for a given planetary whip mixer and foaming solution, the set of dimensionless ratios characterizing the course of gas hold-up can be reduced to modified Froude and revolution numbers, as in the case of a classical mixing system. This requires the introduction of a characteristic velocity, instead of the two individual rotational speeds of the whip, in the corresponding list of governing parameters. An analytical expression for this characteristic velocity is then proposed, and gas hold-up measurements are made at various whip speed ratios, using a given food model-recipe, containing whole eggs and sugar. Our experimental results were evaluated, in order to validate the proposed dimensional analysis. It is shown that the aeration process requires a very low, modified revolution number to reach steady state values. It is also shown that the asymptotic values of gas hold-up are influenced by the modified Froude number. Depending on the values of the modified Froude number, it is noted that coalescence can occur, which then contributes to a reduction in gas hold-up. It has also been established that the modified Froude number can account for the eccentricity of planetary mixers, and consequently, that this number is a robust indicator for the determination of the optimum gas hold-up value, when air incorporation is produced by various planetary whipping devices. The results described in this paper enable foaming processes using planetary whipping mixers to be optimized, by proposing a framework in which the impeller speed ratio and aeration time can be set in such a way as to control the simultaneous entrainment and disentrainment of gas. Finally, this work can be further extended to other gas/liquid applications in which planetary mixers are used, such as surface aeration in wastewater treatment plants.",

Solutions with different ratios of lactose and chitosan have been spray dried at an inlet temperature of 160\u00a0\u00b0C using a laboratory-scale spray dryer. Water-induced crystallization, X-ray diffraction analysis and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to study the crystallinity of the spray-dried lactose/chitosan powders. Results show that, despite the ability of chitosan to retain moisture for a longer time during spray drying, the spray-dried powders were in the amorphous form. Moisture-induced crystallization and differential scanning calorimetry results suggest that the presence of chitosan delays lactose crystallization. This finding may be due to the high glass-transition temperature of chitosan, despite its ability to hydrogen bond with water, which was suggested previously by other researchers to be a reason for crystallizing lactose during spray drying in the presence of polyethylene glycol.",

     "abstract": "An objective measurement technique is needed to simplify the determination of total milk-clotting activity (at) of rennets and other milk coagulating enzymes. IDF Standard 157: 2007/ISO 11815 is the current standard method for bovine rennets and measures milk-clotting activity by visually determining the Berridge clotting time (i.e., time of appearance of flocks of renneted standard milk substrate on the wall of a rotating test tube). The IDF Standard 157: 2007 method is somewhat subjective because it depends on an operator\u2019s skill to consistently identify milk flocculation. An optical method based on changes in infrared light backscatter at 880\u00a0nm during milk coagulation is proposed as an alternative, objective method to Berridge clotting time to eliminate the operator\u2019s subjectivity from the IDF Standard 157: 2007. The Berridge clotting time method and a proposed optical method were compared using 29 replications to determine the precision of at measurements. The light backscatter profiles collected during the coagulation process were analyzed with five optical time parameters determined for each profile. The at, expressed in International Milk-Clotting Units (IMCU\u00a0mL\u22121), was calculated using Berridge clotting time and each of the five optical time parameters. The calculated milk-clotting activities were compared statistically to determine differences between measurement methods. No significant differences were found between the at determined using the Berridge clotting time and the optical time parameters, t2min and t2min2. Preferred optical time parameters tmax and t2min were recommended. The results show that the proposed optical method based on measurement of changes in infrared light backscatter is a potential objective method for at measurement.",

The approach was to work on an actual product and equipment representative of that used in the industry. Surimi seafood paste was characterized in different mixing durations by measurements of particle size, protein solubility and water absorption, temperature and viscoelastic properties, in order to follow the structural modifications and the interactions generated by the mixing process.Two major periods are highlighted during the process: in the first step, the frozen surimi melts; therefore, the shredding of fibers causes a huge reduction in particle size and protein solubilization. Then, temperature increases due to viscous heating. Temperature augmentation leads to denaturation and aggregation of proteins. This then render to the formation of a gel network that will be broken by the ongoing mixing operation. This clearly shows that, during this second step, overmixing affects the functionality of proteins. This functionality is countered by the gelling due to the increase in temperature and subsequent degradation in the mixing process during the gel formation.",

FaDOH was observed to be the most susceptible to degradation during frozen storage of unblanched carrot disks, followed by FaOH and FaDOAc.

Product change due to mass transfer is at stake and, with it, its consumer value and consideration.Carbonation loss takes place at the product/package interface, and to the environment through the package itself. In this paper a joint experimental/computational approach has been exploited: the CO 2 loss through the polyethylene terephthalate barrier has been computed by means of a multidimensional finite element code, while actual measurements have been carried out to validate the computations.Residual carbonation histories are validated and presented for a variety of thermal regimes and for two different bottles carrying the same capacity. The paper highlights on the combination of bottle weight, initial carbonation and storage temperature, indicating the operational set for the longest shelf life within the explored cases. Lighter bottles can be used with no inference on shelf life, while the carbonic loss depends non-linearly on initial carbonation and temperature increment. The associated concentration maps help infer on the importance of polyethylene terephthalate thickness uniformity.It is then demonstrated that the model carries the flexibility of a general tool, applicable to any carbonated beverage at any storage condition.",

Local velocities and regions of backflow were compared for three configurations of the paddle elements in the mixing region consisting of nine pairs of paddle elements with the central three being in a neutral (FLAT), staggered 45\u00b0 forward (45F) or staggered 45\u00b0 reverse (45R) configuration. The total material flow rate through the mixer was independent of the paddle element stagger but increased with screw speed when the mixer was operated with the barrel fully filled. The stagger angle variation caused only local disturbances in axial flow. The overall magnitudes of velocity were highest for the FLAT configuration followed by 45F and 45R. The local X and Y velocity components in the region of stagger showed no significant variation with paddle element stagger while the Z velocity component varied significantly in this region. Increased forward flow was seen for the 45F configuration while significant local backflow was seen for the 45R configuration at all positions of the paddle element rotation. The FLAT configuration had greater levels of pressure in the intermeshing region, suggesting a squeeze flow while there were not significant variations in pressure for the 45F and 45R configurations, suggesting a predominantly conveying/leakage flow in the axial direction. Variation in local flows is critical to good mixing.",

When the solute concentration was low with low osmotic pressure as in the case of the model pear flavor solution, the apparent partition coefficient (Kapp) between the ice and the concentrated liquid phase was low to give a high yield. For samples with high solute concentrations, however, Kapp increased with an increase in solute concentration to reduce the yield in PFC operation. In this case, the partial melting of ice was effective. In this method, the ice crystal formed after PFC was melted gradually with time to collect the melted fractions with intervals. Then the initial fractions were found to contain the higher amount of solute. Therefore, the yield could be improved to a necessary level (>90%) by recovering these fractions with the higher solute concentration. The recovered melted ice fraction may be mixed with the feed in the succeeding batch of PFC operation to avoid dilution of the concentrate. The partial ice melting will extend the practical applicability of PFC substantially.",

It is also an important barrier for water exchange between the intercellular space and the cytoplasm and as such affects moisture loss of fruit during commercial storage. In this manuscript the nanostructure and water exchange properties of different artificially produced cell walls were investigated. Three artificial cell walls, bacterial cellulose (BC), bacterial cellulose with pectin (BCP) and bacterial cellulose with pectin and xyloglucan (BCPX), were prepared using a culture of Gluconoacetobacter xylinus in Hestrin and Schramm medium. The microscopic structure of three artificial cell walls was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface images showed clear differences in the diameter of the microfibrils and the density of the fibril network. The degree of compactness was highest for BCPX, than BCP and BC. Desorption isotherms of the three artificial cell walls were measured. It was found that the water retention capacity at the same water activity was higher for BC than for the other two artificial cell walls; BCP had higher water retention capacity than BCPX. Cellulose has a high water retention capacity that increases with increasing void space ratio in cellulose containing membrane. The resulting water conductivity values of the different artificial cell walls at 3\u00a0\u00b0C/95% RH and 25\u00a0\u00b0C/85% RH were measured. The lowest value of water conductivity was found for BCPX while the highest value was found for the pure BC.

Electrospraying is known to yield fine droplets of size down to 20\u00a0\u03bcm, giving the potential of very thin and even coatings. A single electrospraying nozzle was used to characterise droplet formation and investigate the formation of thin films on well-defined surfaces. The experimental droplet size was successfully described as a function of operational parameters and liquid properties using scaling relations. The influence of operating parameters as nozzle height and electrostatic potential were evaluated as well.Thin film deposition was experimentally investigated for sunflower oil electro-sprayed on a highly conductive (aluminium) and insulating target surface (Parafilm). For both aluminium foil and Parafilm the droplet deposition was found to be random. For aluminium foil, being a conductive target, this was expected as repellence between droplets on the surface and new droplets is low, due to charge leakage to the ground. For Parafilm, droplet repellence appeared so large that droplets deposited on larger empty spots or were even pushed away from the surface. To evaluate the film formation performance, Monte Carlo simulations were carried out, and it was found that the method is a useful tool to characterise droplet deposition and film formation characteristics.",

The attributes compared were yield, content of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds and economic feasibility. Similar extraction yields were obtained by LPSE and PLE under optimized conditions; however 2.15 and 1.66-fold more anthocyanins and total phenolic compounds, respectively, were extracted using PLE, while the cost of manufacturing (COM) obtained for the PLE extract was 40-fold lower.",

     "abstract": "Meringues are characterized by a predominant air phase and their overall quality is intimately related with microstructure. The formation of meringues microstructure relies on the capacity of egg white (EW) proteins to form voluminous and stable foams and it is ultimately related with the chemical properties of proteins and with the addition of ingredients such as sugars, salts, acids and surfactants.The study aimed at assessing the influence of sugar/EW ratio, citric acid and EW type on the microstructural and mechanical properties of meringues. Meringues prepared with different sugar/EW, citric acid level and different EW type were subjected to microstructural analysis by X-ray microtomography and to mechanical assessment by compression tests.Results demonstrate the ability of X-ray microtomography to reconstruct the 3D microstructure of meringues allowing the measurement of porosity, size, shape and distribution of pores. Citric acid, sugar concentration and EW type play a fundamental role on meringues microstructural parameters and mechanical properties. Low sugar/EW ratios as well as increasing citric acid levels increase the air phase and result in a softer texture of meringues. Moreover, low sugar/EW ratios and increasing citric acid in the meringue result in a reduction of pore size and also influence the shape of pores. Meringues microstructural and mechanical properties are affected by the EW quality: fresh and pasteurized EWs and EWs stored at refrigerated temperatures scored the highest structural and mechanical performances, while powdered and frozen EWs and albumens from old eggs showed the worst results. Not only the balance among ingredients but also the choice of raw materials can strongly affect the final quality of meringues.",

The operating conditions were: 20\u00a0kHz, 4.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71\u00a0W and 20% of amplitude.Before and after the HIUS treatment, the size of protein particles was measured by static light scattering. The amount of sulfhydryl groups was determined with Ellman\u2019s reagent and the surface hydrophobicity by a fluorescence technique.The effects of HIUS on samples viscosity were determined. The evolution of the elastic (G\u2032) and viscous (G\u2033) moduli as well as tan \u03b4 were registered upon time and temperature in a controlled stress rheometer.In general, HIUS promoted a decrease in the consistency index of all protein solutions, mainly of soybean isolate. The gelation performance of EW was not modified by HIUS. However, WPC presented a higher elastic character, but 500E did not show changes upon heating, as it was already denatured before HIUS treatment. The size of aggregates suffered an overall reduction for WPC and 500E, but a slight increase for EW. Sulfhydryl content was unchanged for all proteins after HIUS application but surface hydrophobicity was greatly increased after treatment for all proteins. HIUS affected the studied functional properties differently depending on the size and nature of the protein. This technology could be used to obtain improved functional properties in some protein samples.",

The cocoa beans were dried in thin layer using dehumidified air at 28.2\u00a0\u00b0C, 40.4\u00a0\u00b0C and 56\u00a0\u00b0C. Moisture contents of the bean, testa and cotyledon were recorded during drying. Reduction in moisture content was relatively fast at the testa as compared to the cotyledon in the initial two hours of drying. Subsequent drying showed a crossover region where the moisture content of the testa was higher than the cotyledon. The final moisture content of the testa was found to be higher than the inner cotyledon at the end of drying. This showed that moisture migrated from the cotyledon (lower moisture content) to the testa (higher moisture content) during drying. Although such transfer mechanism seems contradict but this can be further explained by the mass transfer potential concept as postulated by Luikov where the transfer of moisture is due to moisture potential difference instead of moisture content difference. Product quality analyses showed percent retention of cocoa polyphenols ranged from 44% to 73% as compared to freeze dried sample. Bean hardness was found reasonably comparable to the commercial sample and increased with decreasing moisture content.",

     "abstract": "Variable power programmes for microwave assisted air drying of pineapple were studied. The pineapple pieces were pre-treated by osmotic dehydration in a 55\u00b0 Brix sucrose solution at 40\u00a0\u00b0C for 90\u00a0min. Variable power output programmes were designed and ran with different inlet air temperatures between 30 and 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Results indicated that the use of variable microwave power combined with low air temperatures can result in a fast drying process without significant charring of pineapple pieces. High microwave powers need to be reduced quickly, faster than the decrease in water content would suggest, to minimize charring. In this study an inlet air temperatures of 70\u00a0\u00b0C was found to be excessive when combined with microwave energy (5\u00a0W/g \u2013 after compensating for the moisture loss), resulting in fast temperature increase. Microwave power was found to be most effective in the first hour to 1.5\u00a0h of processing. It should then be reduced to 0.1\u00a0W/g (initial product weight) in the final stages of drying to avoid charring of the fruit pieces. The best microwave programme tested lead to 20% water content with just 1% losses due to charring, but the results allow to conclude that charring could be completely reduced by switching off microwave energy altogether after 1.5\u00a0h and then finish off drying with higher air temperatures. The use of low air temperatures (30\u201350\u00a0\u00b0C) is advantageous with microwave energy in the first stages of drying as it limits the peaks of specific energy absorption, but it slows down drying towards the end probably because of a too low point of equilibrium (saturation humidity of air). Microwave energy did not significantly influence the drying process towards the end, although drying rates showed a \u201cmemory effect\u201d, that is, drying rates in processes with the same conditions after a given time depended on the conditions up to that point.",

     "abstract": "The product temperature in refrigerated display cabinets is very variable and directly influences the safety and quality of food products. This variability is due to the type of display cabinet (vertical, horizontal), the position of the product inside the cabinet, fluctuations in the ambient temperature in supermarkets (day/night, opening hours, seasons, air conditioning, etc.) and the surrounding conditions of the display cabinet (in front of another refrigerated display cabinet or in front of grocery products, etc.).This study proposes a heat transfer model to predict the load temperature in an open vertical display cabinet. Heat transfer by conduction, convection and radiation was taken into account in the model. Four load positions were considered: top/front, top/rear, bottom/front and bottom/rear where the product temperatures are significantly different. The model was validated by comparing predicted values with experimental ones.

Through integration of quality and microbiological predictive models, this approach can be used as a numerical tool for quality and sanitary evaluation of products displayed in display cabinets. The developed model will be further used in the modelling of the cold chain, which comprises several types of refrigeration equipment.",

     "abstract": "A novel method was developed for concentrating proteins from sorghum flour utilizing a combination of extrusion and \u03b1-amylase treatment for starch liquefaction. A central composite design was used to optimize in-barrel moisture content (MC), enzyme concentration during extrusion (E1) and post-extrusion enzyme concentration (E2) in order to produce sorghum protein concentrates with high protein content (PC) and in vitro protein digestibility (D). Extrusion-enzyme liquefaction yielded concentrates with higher protein yield (82\u00a0db%) and digestibility (66%) than batch liquefaction alone because extrusion promoted starch and protein degradation. The optimum conditions for developing a sorghum protein concentrate with both high yield and digestibility were 32% MC, no E1, and 2.5% E2. The sorghum protein concentrate developed in this study can augment the nutritional value of gluten-free foods for individuals suffering from celiac disease and other forms of gluten and wheat intolerance.",

The applied additions of carob fibre (1\u20135%) and oat wholemeal (5\u201325%) increased the water absorption of the dough within nearly identical ranges (56\u201359%). Enrichment with carob fibre made the dough more rheologically stable during mixing compared to dough with oat wholemeal. In the extension test, dough with an admixture of carob fibre was more resistant, but it was less extensible than dough with oat wholemeal.Analysis of relationships of the extensograph traits to the farinograph ones revealed that longer periods of development of dough enriched with the additions under examination involved the formation of a looser dough structure, as a result of which its resistance to extension, ratio number and energy decreased and the dough extensibility increased. Opposite effects were caused by increasing farinograph elasticity and its loss. The degree of softening, negatively correlating with resistance, ratio number and energy, coupled with water absorption or with loss of elasticity, permitted their more accurate prediction. In turn, combining in a regression model of water absorption with development time or with elasticity was the most suitable for predicting dough extensibility.",

Addition of sucrose, cellulose, and lecithin into the fat films decreased the diffusivity of moisture, but increased the permeability of moisture due to the high moisture sorption capacity of these hydrophilic components.The effect of sucrose concentration and the presence of sugar ester in the aqueous phase on the diffusivity and permeability of moisture through the fat-based film were also studied. For pure PKO films, sucrose concentration of the aqueous phase and presence of sugar ester in the aqueous phase had no effect on the diffusivity and permeability. For fat-based films containing sucrose, with increasing sucrose concentration of the aqueous phase, the diffusivity increased but the permeability decreased. Presence of sugar ester at 0.3% in the aqueous phase significantly increased permeability of the fat-based films containing sucrose.The mass transfer coefficient for sucrose leaching from the fat based films into the aqueous phase increased with sucrose content in the film. The rate of sucrose leaching out from the fat film into 0.3% sugar ester solution was higher than that into pure water. The diffusivity of sucrose in the fat film leaching out into the aqueous phase increased with sucrose content in the fat films.",

Furthermore, t-RVT nanoparticles showed significantly enhanced saturation solubility and dissolution rate by the decrease in particle size and degree of crystallinity when compared to the raw t-RVT.

The first, which presented lower value, is due to the matrix formed by sugar and water. The second one, less visible and less plasticized by water, probably corresponds to macromolecules. The data of Tg were satisfactory correlated by the Gordon\u2013Taylor model. A convective tray dryer was used for the drying experiments, which were carried out at air temperatures of 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 70\u00a0\u00b0C and air velocity of 1.0\u00a0m/s. The shrinkage behavior was accomplished by total area and apparent volume alterations along drying. Samples were photographed during process, and their length and lateral areas were measured using the ImageJ\u00ae software. As result, the effect of air temperature on shrinkage was significant and the highest temperature (70\u00a0\u00b0C) induced higher extent of shrinkage values. At this condition, papaya sample was in a rubbery state, characterized by great matrix mobility, and remained so until the end of process, since product temperature (Tp) was above the Tg along the process. At lower temperature (40\u00a0\u00b0C), shrinkage stopped at a critical value of moisture content (0.21\u00a0g/g, wet basis), which coincided with the point in which the Tg was close to Tp.",

At low normal loads, all the materials are found to change their strength characteristics regularly, with increasing moisture content resulting in higher values for shear stresses. However, under high normal loads, an opposite trend was observed for some materials, for which there is the potential of a lubricating effect to develop, resulting in unpredictable bed behavior in a silo. Low moisture contents reduced shear-stress oscillations occurring in the bed of dry material considerably. At higher moisture contents, an unacceptably long horizontal shear displacement was needed to establish steady-state shearing conditions. This may render the Jenike shear-tester inappropriate in the examination of powders of higher moisture content, especially those composed of easily deformable particles. NMR analysis proved that chemical composition of water surrounding the moistened seeds was changing during the time and that may affect the granular bed flow characteristics.",

     "abstract": "Postharvest treatments of fruits in storage rooms using a fogging system is a recent development that offer a promising means to reduce the use of fungicides in the orchards, where ecological and environmental risks are higher than in the closed environment of the storage room. To investigate the effectiveness of postharvest storage fungicide fogging systems, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and validated. A discrete element (DE) method was applied to generate a random stacking of spherical fruits in a typical bin. The CFD model was then employed to study explicitly the air and fungicide particle flow through the bin vent holes and through the voids of the stack, and to predict the deposition behaviour of the fungicide particle on the products. For model validation purposes, a standardized set-up was used with a single fruit bin positioned in a cold store that was operated at different air flow rates. Good agreement was found between measured and predicted results of deposition profiles of fungicide particles. The deposition on the top layer of the fruit stack was higher than the bottom one, and higher deposition was observed on the top sides than on the bottom sides of the fruit.The effect of air flow rates and different bin handling parameters on fungicide particles flow and deposition were investigated. Air circulation rates of 0\u00a0m3\u00a0h\u22121 (no air circulation), 4080\u00a0m3\u00a0h\u22121 and 6800\u00a0m3\u00a0h\u22121 and 9520\u00a0m3\u00a0h\u22121 were used. The highest fungicide deposition on the fruit was observed during fogging without air circulation while the lowest deposition corresponded to fogging with the highest air circulation rate. Covering the top of the bin with foil and removing the bottom plastic foam that is usually placed on the bottom floor of the bin improves the uniformity of fungicide deposition throughout the bin. Removing the bottom plastic liner increased the average deposition of the fungicide particles, while covering the top of the bin decreased the average deposition.",

This research was aimed to develop a prototype for real-time citrus canker detection. An inspection module was developed on a one-line commercial fruit sorting machine. Twenty tungsten halogen spotlights coupled with an aluminum dome painted with white diffuse paint provided reflectance illumination to the fruits in the detection chamber. The camera unit was a two-band spectral imaging system, which mainly consisted of a beamsplitter, two bandpass filters with central wavelengths at 730 and 830\u00a0nm, and two identical monochrome cameras. Using an exposure time of 10\u00a0ms, the imaging system can capture narrowband images without blurring from samples moving at a speed of 5 fruits/s. Spatial resolution of the acquired images was 2.3\u00a0pixels/mm. Real-time image processing and classification algorithms were developed based on a two-band ratio approach (i.e., R830/R730). The system was tested using 360 grapefruits with normal surface, canker lesions, and other peel diseases and defects. The overall classification accuracy was 95.3%, demonstrating that the methodology as well as the hardware and the software are effective and suitable for real-time citrus canker detection. Greasy spot, melanose, and sooty mold could generate false positive errors for the fruits without canker. The current system setup was limited to a single perspective view of the fruits.

Experimental and numerical tests were carried out on an industrial scale A-SSHE used to heat hazelnut paste, an intermediate product widely used in Italian confectionery industry. Experimental tests include physical, chemical and rheological characterization of the hazelnut paste and the evaluation of the overall heat transfer coefficient as a function of rotational speeds and mass flow rates. Three-dimensional axial-symmetric CFD simulations of the A-SSHE were performed by using the software Fluent 6.2. For comparison, the same numerical tests were carried out for an equivalent SSHE with a conventional blades design (C-SSHE). Our studies show that the A-SSHE gives heat transfer coefficient values almost twice that of an equivalent C-SSHE, and that the numerical results are consistent with the experimental observations. The analysis of the fluid dynamics and of the thermal profiles suggests that the higher heat transfer efficiency of A-SSHE may be attributed to the occurrence of backmixing phenomena.",

Their relationship with maturity, as well as the potential of their combination was studied. As a result, two rather independent (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.3) groups of non-destructive measurements, chlorophyll related optical indexes and low mass impact (LMI) measurements, were identified. Optical measurements showed the best behaviour for assessing maturity at harvest, while LMI measurements reflected handling incidences, showing a promising potential to be used to control transport and postharvest handling.",

The initial retention of anthocyanins depended significantly on the waterbinding ability of spray dried microcapsules. The higher the waterbinding capacity of spray dried powders the lower was the anthocyanin release. Highest waterbinding capacity and lowest anthocyanin release was gained by citrus pectin with a high degree of esterification (DE) and sugar beet pectin. In general high DE pectins inhibited the release stronger than low DE pectins.",

Blends containing 0%, 17%, 22%, and 28% pomace were hydrated to 17.2% by adding water either into the preconditioner (P), the extruder (E) or dividing half in each (PE). Increasing the opportunity for hydration (P\u00a0>\u00a0PE\u00a0>\u00a0E) promoted more complete starch gelatinization at all pomace levels. Apple pomace promoted milder extrusion conditions, resulting in less starch gelatinization and solubilization, poor expansion and reduced starch digestibility. Digestible starch was inversely correlated to cell wall thickness/cell size ratio (r\u00a0=\u00a00.91), which increased with pomace addition. Thus, pomace decreased digestibility by promoting changes in structure and gelatinization. Delayed water addition (E) promoted broader cell size and cell wall thickness distributions, attributed to poor mixing and hydration. Therefore, water incorporation (not just total content) is a key factor in defining extrudate microstructure, texture and digestibility patterns.",

The measurements indicated small temperature differences in beef meatballs, mozzarella cheese and sauce when they were properly distributed between layers of noodles. Simulation results suggested that in spite of large differences in electric field intensities in different food components, adequate heat transfer reduced differential heating.

Simulations show that a simple profile, i.e., a constant phase followed by a linear temperature change and a second constant phase, is the most informative taking into account computational requirements and practical implementations.Second, experiments in which the temperature crosses the growth/inactivation interface are evaluated. The simulation study illustrates that the accuracy of T max largely depends on the selected temperature profile. A reliable T max is obtained when the initial temperature is slightly lower than the true T max . Starting above T max result in larger uncertainties. Generally, information at temperatures close to T max is required for an accurate T max estimate.",

Raman chemical imaging is a new technique that shows promise for mapping constituents of interest in complex food matrices. In this study, a benchtop point-scan Raman chemical imaging system was developed to detect and visualize internal lycopene distribution during postharvest ripening of tomatoes. Tomato samples at different ripeness stages (i.e., green, breaker, turning, pink, light red, and red) were selected and cut open for imaging. Hyperspectral Raman images were acquired from fruit cross-sections in the wavenumber range of 200\u20132500\u00a0cm\u22121 with a spatial resolution of 1\u00a0mm. A polynomial curve-fitting method was used to correct for the underlying fluorescence background in the original spectra. A hyperspectral image classification method was developed based on spectral information divergence to identify lycopene in the tomato cross-sections. Raman chemical images were created to visualize the spatial distribution of the lycopene for different ripeness stages. The system was also configured to test the feasibility of utilizing spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) technique for subsurface detection of a Teflon slab placed under samples of outer pericarp cut in 5-mm and 10-mm thick slices from green and breaker tomatoes. The results showed that the Raman spectrum of Teflon can be extracted from the SORS measurements of the pericarps placed over the Teflon, demonstrating the potential of the future development of a Raman-based nondestructive approach for subsurface detection of lycopene as an indicator of tomato maturity.",

In the case of water-in-oil emulsions, an oil phase structuration is achieved by the creation of a saturated fat crystalline network inside which water droplets are entrapped. Traditional technology based on the hydrogenation of vegetable oils, leads to the formation of saturated trans-fatty acids, considered unhealthy owing to their potential contribution to cardio-vascular diseases. As a consequence, nowadays the use of hydrogenated fatty acids has been reduced and the consumption of healthy oils has increased. However oils need to be properly structured to be used as solid fat replacers.The present work deals with the rheological study of W/O emulsions, structured through the oil phase crystallisation by organogelator agents (mono- and di-glycerides of fatty acids). The oil phase was prepared by blending a high-oleic-acid-containing oil (olive oil) with a natural saturated fatty acids source (cocoa butter). A highly structured network is obtained by rapidly cooling the molten oil phase at low shear rates. The emulsions prepared were compared with commercial margarines and they showed rheological properties suitable to a potential application as \u201csolid fats\u201d.",

In dynamic frequency sweeps, the critical frequency for strain thickening decreased with the increasing of the strain amplitude (\u03b3o).

Superchilling as used for preserving foods, has been defined as a process by which the temperature of a food product is lowered to 1\u20132\u00a0\u00b0C below the initial freezing point. Fresh and high quality food products are in great demand worldwide. Temperature is a major factor determining the shelf life and quality of food products. Fish and meat are perishable food commodities, where better and more advanced preservation technology is needed. Deterioration of these foods mainly occurs as a result of chemical, enzymatic and bacteriological activities leading to loss of quality and subsequent spoilage. Storing food at superchilling temperature has three distinct advantages: maintaining food freshness, retaining high food quality and suppressing growth of harmful microbes. It can reduce the use of freezing/thawing for production and thereby increase yield, reduce energy, labour and transport costs. The study on the growth mechanism of ice crystals, modelling and computer simulation of foods during superchilling and superchilling storage is needed.",

It was shown that these multivalent anions can influence the membrane charge through interactions with calcium, even though they are unlikely to adsorb to the membrane surface. Specifically, both phosphate and citrate can form soluble charged species with the calcium ions, reducing the net Ca2+ concentration and hence the overall effect of calcium on the membrane. This ion interaction effect becomes more dominant at higher pH values, due to the greater tendency of calcium to interact with either phosphate or citrate at higher pH.",

Tocopherols and triacylglycerols are extracted more quickly at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Numerical simulations of the extraction process reveal that it would be possible to obtain oil with smaller concentrations of phospholipids and waxes, working at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and using fewer stages.

An excellent linear correlation between the average signal intensity and the water content was obtained (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.984). The T1 values of cheese brined at 4.8% were almost constant but T1 values decreased for both 13.0% and 23.0% salt brined cheeses. Analysis of the CPMG decays gave relaxation spectra containing two components which decreased during brining. The short component T2a was highly correlated with salt content (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.974). Results showed that NMR and MRI can be used to follow salt uptake and changes in water content in cheese during brining.",

     "abstract": "Heat treatment of milk results in the development of a large range of Maillard products, especially in infant formulas due to their high content in Maillard reaction substrates. The Maillard reaction should be minimized because some of those products, called neo-formed contaminants (NFC), are currently suspected of promoting deleterious health effects. The objective of this work was to study the impact of microwave heating on the formation of Maillard compounds, degradation of nutrients and destruction of spores of an infant formula model. An infant formula model based on pure-whey proteins was used as experimental model. A spore suspension of Geobacillus stearothermophilus was prepared and inoculated in the formulated milk before microwave treatment. The treatment was performed on a laboratory device running at 2450\u00a0MHz and equipped with a magnetron (power range 0\u20131860\u00a0W) and the temperature was controlled by three optical fibers. Heating kinetics were established at several microwave specific powers (5, 7, 10, 12\u00a0W/mL). The impact of the treatment on NFC formation was evaluated by 3 indicators: the FAST index (indicator of global advancement of Maillard reaction), carboxymethyllysine (CML) and furosine. All these NFC indicators seemed to follow an exponential model as a function of time. The thermal sensitive nutrient vitamin C was chosen as indicator of the nutritional quality. Like in conventional heating, an exponential model was observed for spore inactivation and vitamin C degradation. Furthermore, laws similar to those used for conventional heating could be used to express heat resistance regarding germ viability, vitamin C concentration and Maillard products. As a result, D and z-values relative to specific microwave powers were determined for each indicator. Finally, it was found that the best way to minimize NFC formation and nutrient degradation was to use high specific power for a short time, similar to what is obtained with the UHT process for conventional heating.",

All samples showed a viscoelastic solid behavior with the storage modulus (G\u2032) dominating the viscoelastic response. Overall, both dynamic moduli decreased, and instantaneous compliance (J0), decay compliances (J1 and J2) and fluidity significantly increased after treatments and storage at 5\u00a0\u00b0C, while retardation times were in general constant. Fracture properties proved to be the most highly correlated with sensory texture. The test panel only significantly differentiated stored untreated apple from the other samples regarding fracturability and juiciness.

However, negative correlations for these parameters were observed at higher MTG concentrations. When MTG level was greater than 15\u00a0U, gel stiffness or peak force tended to decrease. The improvement in gel strength or gel peak force for the MPI with inclusion of MTG suggested that some \u03b5 (\u03b3-glutamyl) lysine (G-L) crosslinking occurred among myofibrillar molecules. Thus, MTG is useful in improving gelation properties of heat-induced MPI gel and provides new opportunities to expand the utilization of low value meat in muscle foods.",

A log 5 and log 6 reduction could be achieved by inactivating Lactobacillus plantarum BFE 5092 and Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 in naturally cloudy apple juice at 1.9 and 7.7\u00a0kJ/L, respectively. A treatment with 9.6\u00a0kJ/L led to an approximately log 4 inactivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DSM 70478 and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris DSM 2498. The effects of possible influencing parameters such as optical density, turbidity and viscosity were analyzed with regard to the efficiency of the UV-C treatment. The optical density based on dissolved compounds appeared to be the most important factor which influenced the bacterial inactivation efficiency. Cell counts of L. plantarum BFE 5092 could be reduced in quarter-strength Ringer\u2019s solution adjusted with dye from an initial level of approximately 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u20131\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101\u00a0cfu/mL at an optical density (254\u00a0nm) of 20 at 9.6\u00a0kJ/L. Only a log 1.5 reduction, however, could be achieved at an optical density (254\u00a0nm) of 140 using the same UV-C treatment. Furthermore, no noticeable effect on inactivation could be determined by varying the turbidity or the viscosity of the juices investigated. An increasing flow rate and the consequently higher Dean number clearly improved the efficacy of the UV-C treatment. Thus, the inactivation of L. plantarum BFE 5092 in blood orange juice could be enhanced by an approximately 2.5-log reduction by increasing the Dean number from 32 to 256 at 7.7\u00a0kJ/L. The UV-C treatment using Dean vortex technology was shown in this study to effectively inactivate microorganisms even in cloudy juices. The optical density value seemed to be the exclusive determining factor on the efficiency of the UV-C inactivation of microorganisms based on Dean vortex technology, while the effect of suspended solids was negligible as a result of the efficient mixing by Dean vortices.",

Acids were concentrated most effectively at pH 3.5 or below, when they were in their undissociated forms; their enrichment factors were reduced by up to 84% when the pH was increased to 7. Milk fat reduced the pervaporation enrichment of flavour compounds by up to 95%, as the flavour compounds partitioned into the fat phase and hence did not pass through the membrane as easily.

     "abstract": "Addition of bran reduces the expansion of extruded starchy foams. This may be attributed to changes in parameters driving expansion. Wheat flour was supplemented with wheat bran to achieve two levels of fibers (12.6% and 22.4%) and extruded under different conditions of barrel temperature (120 or 180\u00a0\u00b0C), water content in the feed (18% or 22%) or screw speed (400 or 800\u00a0rpm). Increasing the bran concentration decreased sectional and volumetric expansions and increased longitudinal expansion. Finer cellular structures consisting of an increased number of small cells with more spherical shapes were generated. This may be linked to an increased nucleation at the die. The reduction in volumetric expansion was associated with an increase in shear viscosity only at the highest bran concentration. At same extrusion conditions the glass transition temperature of starch was reduced by down to 15\u00a0\u00b0C by supplementation with bran. This may induce a decrease in the viscosity of the starch phase and counteract the matrix viscosity increase linked to the properties of bran. A higher surface porosity was observed in the bran containing recipe due to earlier burst of the bubbles during growth.",

     "abstract": "Soybeans contribute to healthy nutrition because of the high proportion and quality of proteins. Its oil content is considerably lower than in peanuts, restricting energy intake. Precooked samples prepared at increasing drying\u2013toasting times (lower moisture contents) experienced shrinkage and deformation.With the aim of determining design parameters for this process, fluid-dynamic studies of samples extracted at several times during drying\u2013toasting allowed us to determine laminar and turbulent coefficients of the Ergun equation and the minimum fluidisation velocity (Vmf), at ambient temperatures. The turbulent coefficient increased for decreasing moistures and Vmf varied from 2.6 and 1.2\u00a0m/s over a 60\u00a0min process. As drying\u2013toasting must be conducted at 140\u00a0\u00b0C, an increase by 20% in Vmf is required. Operating velocities were 50% above Vmf to produce uniform treatment. As the system requires a decreasing fluidisation velocity with time, an automatic control with time-varying target value should be devised to limit energy consumption and prevent solid losses.",

Density was similar for all conditions. Increasing sodium alginate concentration resulted in a significant decrease in the heat capacity and thermal conductivity values.

As the liquid film became thinner, the temperature could be heated to nearly 80\u00a0\u00b0C. The pasteurization effect was verified using lactic acid bacteria as the target microorganism; the heat resistance of the bacteria was measured, the death of bacteria was confirmed, and the effectiveness of the equipment was verified. Furthermore, a mathematical model for FIR pasteurization was developed using a heat transfer equation and thermal death equation. The simulation could make predictions about temperature and the viable count of bacteria that compared very well with the experimental results. Moreover, the model simulated the change of temperature and viable count of bacteria at different flow rates, and showed that it is possible to sterilize at low temperatures with this equipment.",

This approach allows the derivation of the tT-profile of any portion of the food product with a limited computational effort.Together with the analytic description of the modelling structure and of its elements, the paper presents a case study concerning a stage of a peach juice production plant to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

     "abstract": "In the presented research three measurement strategies of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry (horizontal- and micro-attenuated total reflection (HATR and \u03bcATR, respectively) and a novel high throughput transmission (HTT)) in combination with extensive chemometric approach have been applied for analysis of beer. Fifty Belgian beer samples were analyzed: lager and white beers, dark and blonde ales, lambic and Trappist beers. Partial least square (PLS) regression was used for prediction of different physicochemical parameters of beer based on mid-IR data, modified with different spectral preprocessing and variable selection algorithms for higher prediction performance. It was found that HATR and \u03bcATR have the same prediction capability with a slight advantage of \u03bcATR and excellent correlations between spectra and reference values were demonstrated for original (R2 0.95), apparent (R2 0.89) and real (R2 0.95) extracts, real and apparent degrees of fermentation (R2 0.91 and 0.89), alcohol content (R2 0.94) and energetic value (R2 0.95). Good results (R2 0.83) were obtained from the HTT experiments for prediction of real extract and allow measurement of large sample numbers in short time (1 sample/minute) with further potential increase in a sample throughput and has the possibility for automation. The obtained results indicate that mid-IR spectrometry in combination with advanced pre-processing and variable selection methods is a valuable analytical tool for high throughput measurement of beer quality attributes and thus has potential for use in product development and quality control.",

An alternative for these wastes is their pressing with lime to obtain a press liquor stream and a dried solid for cattle feeding. The press liquor (around 10\u00a0\u00b0Brix) is traditionally concentrated up to 70\u00a0\u00b0Brix (citrus molasses) by multiple effect evaporation. In this investigation, reverse osmosis is evaluated as an alternative for press liquor preconcentration. Two synthetic feed solutions were studied, one included pectin in its composition (WP) and the other lacked pectin (WOP) to simulate a previous depectinization of WP. The concentration process was evaluated in terms of some selected parameters (chemical oxygen demand, total soluble solids, total dissolved solids and osmotic pressure). The fouling mechanism as well as the membrane resistance to the permeate pass were assessed. It was found that for later stages of concentration cake filtration was the dominant fouling mechanism while for earlier stages, the mechanism found was the complete pore blocking. The presence of pectin not only maximized the membrane fouling but also led to worse permeate quality.",

The averaged spectra and individual spectra of hardening pericarp mangosteen from a calibration set (N\u00a0=\u00a0560) were used to develop classification models, using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).

The quality of the coating process in a fluidised bed is largely determined by the spray characteristics and the particle motion.

The quantitative structure analysis showed that freezing/thawing and compression pre-treatments caused more damage on the apple structure, yielding larger cell cavities in comparison to vacuum impregnation and immersion in boiling water and control. Apple slices that were frozen/thawed, compressed and immersed in boiling water displayed the higher drying rates and diffusivity coefficients than the vacuum impregnated and control samples. These results allow concluding that disruption of the cell walls can be considered as a factor that affects the drying rate.",

Nevertheless, there was no difference in retrogradation rate for waxy rice starch gelatinized by the two treatments (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The DSC data were further analyzed using the Avrami equation. The result indicated that the pressure-gelatinized normal rice starch had a lower recrystallization rate (k) and a higher Avrami exponent (n) than the heat-gelatinized one, but the two treatments did not affect the k and n for waxy rice starch. Furthermore, the intact starch granules and lower amylose leaching were observed only in the pressure-gelatinized normal rice starch. These findings suggest that the retardation mechanism of HHP on starch retrogradation is probably attributed to less broken granules and lower leached amylose.",

The storage temperatures were in the range of \u22128 to \u221225\u00a0\u00b0C with fluctuations of \u00b10.1\u00a0\u00b0C (isothermal), \u00b11, \u00b13 or \u00b15\u00a0\u00b0C about the mean.

The rate of weight loss at constant temperature was nearly proportional to water vapour pressure consistent with standard theories for evaporative weight loss from packaged foods but was also accurately fitted by Arrhenius kinetics. Weight loss increased with amplitude of temperature fluctuations. The increase could not be fully explained by either the physic model based on water vapour pressure differences or the kinetic model alone. An ANN model with six neurons in the input layer, six neurons in hidden layers and one neuron in the output layer, achieved a good fit between experimental and predicted data for all trials.

Indeed, at VRR 1 the optimal transmembrane pressure was 2.5\u00a0bar with a permeate flux of 185\u00a0L\u00a0h\u22121\u00a0m\u22122, while at VRR 20 optimal pressure was 3.7\u00a0bar with a permeate flux of 95\u00a0L\u00a0h\u22121\u00a0m\u22122. A simple model that allowed to represent the effect of VRR and transmembrane pressure on the permeate flux was adjusted with the experiments done at laboratory scale. This model used to predict the permeate flux using a semi-industrial pilot scale equipment gave a good match between the experimental and calculated performances. Permeate was collected aseptically and stored at 4, 20 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 90\u00a0days. A roselle extract storage at 4 and 20\u00a0\u00b0C was appropriate for consumption after a 3\u00a0month shelf life.",

Greater reduction in particle size was achieved with mixer grinder (180\u00a0\u03bcm) with 5\u00a0min of grinding while reduction was not significant beyond 18\u00a0min (233\u00a0\u03bcm) in stone grinder. Specific energy consumption in colloid mill was only one-fourth of the mixer grinder while stone grinder required twice the energy. Although Kick\u2019s, Rittinger\u2019s and Bond\u2019s laws could not be applied for total grinding duration, all the three classical laws were found suitable after the initial grain break-up period (2\u00a0min).

As a proof of concept, magnetically emulsified highly viscous mayonnaise was produced in a batch process and in a continuous process. The viscosity of the mayonnaise was significantly enhanced by applying the magnetic field. The oil droplet size distribution of mayonnaise produced using the magnetic emulsification method was similar to mayonnaise produced with conventional high shear mixers.

     "abstract": "Gels prepared from whey proteins can be used for controlled release of nutrients or active ingredients in food systems. The objective of this study was to characterize the water uptake by these hydrophilic gels to aid in the design of release systems. Whey protein isolate (WPI) gels (17% w/w protein) of different aspect ratios were submersed in aqueous solution at pH 7.0. Modeling of mass uptake is presented in terms of Case I (Fickian diffusion) and Case II (kinetic) models. Due to the extent of swelling, the Fickian diffusion with moving boundaries provided the most realistic reflection of the physics. An optimization routine provided the best fit values for the diffusivity. The average diffusivity for the smaller gels (with an initial radius of 6.7\u00a0mm) was 1.40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0m2/s.

The average diffusivities differed due to the slight variation in the composition of the gels. The model also yielded instantaneous values of the radius and sample length. The functionality of moisture uptake and total surface area was linear. The Fickian diffusion with moving boundary model can be extended to evaluate different geometries for controlled release systems.",

From the first derivate of the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation the rate of the corn grain hydration can be obtained. This mathematical model predicts the hydration and hydration rate of the corn grains during the cooking time of the nixtamalization process. Furthermore, with this proposed model, we can predict that for short times the rate reaches its maximum, and tends to zero for long times as the saturation of the grain is reached. It is concluded that hydration and hydration rate of white corn grains depends significantly on the temperature and cooking water lime concentration (P\u00a0<\u00a00.005).",

For model evaluation and testing, 2500 apples of 19 cultivars were harvested over two seasons. Apples were stored at normal atmosphere (NA), controlled atmosphere (CA) for different periods or were treated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) in order to obtain a high variability of texture and fruit maturity. Apples were tested simultaneously in two distinct laboratories. The models were created and validated on averaged values from 10 fruits using simple linear regression, multiple linear regression (MLR) and principal component regression (PCR). Performance statistics of the models were expressed in terms of determination coefficient (R2), root mean square errors of cross validation (RMSECV) or prediction (RMSEP) and ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD). Firmness and total acoustic emission counts were predictors of sensory texture in the models. MLR and PCR models show better performance for prediction of sensory data than simple linear regression models however PCR models show the best results among models tested in this study. Common PCR models for several cultivars allow for successful prediction of hardness (RPD\u00a0>\u00a02.0), crispness and overall texture (1.5\u00a0<\u00a0RPD\u00a0<\u00a02.0).

The effects of various extrusion processing conditions, such as temperature, screw speed, feeding rate, and water content were systematically investigated. It was found that, while a higher amylose content increased the difficulty of extrusion processing, this could be overcome by increasing the processing temperature, moisture content, and equilibration time. On the other hand, mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, and microscopy showed that films based on higher amylose starch had better mechanical and thermal properties. The reasons include not only the easy entanglement of long linear amylose chains, but also the retained granular structure in high-amylose films, which may act as self-reinforcement.",

The sugar crystallization and storage stability of \u03b2-carotene in freeze-dried mango powder was investigated following storage under various relative vapor pressures (11.3\u201380.9%). Sugar crystallization was revealed by the loss of sorbed water in the water sorption experiment.

X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to confirm the crystallization. The results showed that increased aw resulted in higher sugar crystallization. The loss of \u03b2-carotene was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode-array detector and fitted to a first-order reaction. The rate constant decreased as aw increased up to 0.43, due to the collapse of the mango powder.

The first part of this study consisted in studying the effects of the operating conditions (T, P, CO2 density, flow rate and particle size distribution of ground seeds) on the yield of extraction.

It was observed that the supercritical extraction had no major effect on the fatty acid composition of the vegetal oil compared to classical extraction techniques, while essential oil is enriched in components such as linalool and that a previous drying of the seeds is deleterious.

     "abstract": "In order to extend shelf life of rice and coffee, drying can be conducted to minimize water content so that chemical and biological changes can be retarded. Several models have been proposed to model drying of coffee and rice. For design of dryer and evaluation of dryer performance, the effective and physically meaningful drying model should be implemented. The reaction engineering approach (REA) is applied in this study to model convective drying of coffee as well as convective and intermittent drying of rice. The REA is a unique approach to model drying; the physics of drying is captured by the relative activation energy which can be generated only from one accurate drying experiment. The relative activation energy can be applied to other conditions of drying provided the same material and similar initial moisture content. Results indicate that the REA describes the convective and intermittent drying of rice and coffee very well.",

     "abstract": "The object of this research was to study the real time percent humidity of the air and consequently to analyze this humidity influences on bread rolls. An industrial baking process was visualised by the use of a high-temperature humidity sensor to measure the level of percent humidity of the air (V% H2O) in relation to the different H2O-steam amounts (SA). In this study H2O-SA from 0 to 3.256\u00a0L(H2O)\u00a0m\u22123 of the oven volume were used. After steaming the results of gas moisture without product (GMWoP) showed a higher maximum (approx. 5%) of the percent humidity of the air than the gas moisture with product (GMWP). The trials reveal that the presence of products (bread rolls) is a factor in attaining an increase in the percent humidity of the air which influences product quality. Baking with adequate percent humidity of the air bread roll volume increased by 20% compared to trials without steam. New methods were used to quantify product parameters like crust thickness, compression-force and crispness and to find out correlations with the area under the GMWP curve (auc). Strongest correlations with auc GMWP were found for mean and maximum compression-force. Furthermore, it was shown that the increase in crust thickness, lightness and colour change is mutually dependent on an increase change in the total GMWP.",

Effervescent atomization proved to be largely invariant to variations of liquid viscosity in this range. Relative gas injection pressure proved to be of highest influence on the resulting drop size distribution when varying only atomizer geometry. Applying Abel inversion to drop size measurement results depicted the opposite trend of drop sizes depending on radial position in the spray than observed by other researchers working with aqueous glass bead suspensions. Compared to conventional external mixing pneumatic atomization a reduction of atomization gas quantity of up to four times could be achieved.",

     "abstract": "In first part, a solution scheme for the multiscale fluid transport equation of Singh et al. (2003a) was developed, which could be easily implemented in a commercial finite elements package for solving swelling/shrinking problems. The solution scheme was applied to drying of corn kernels. Laplace transformation was used to convert the integral part of the fluid transport equation to a set of differential equations. In materials undergoing volume change during drying, a moving mesh is needed in Eulerian coordinates, which is tedious to implement. An alternate method was used that involved transforming the equation to stationary Lagrangian coordinates. Once the equations were solved, the data was transformed back to the moving Eulerian coordinates during post-processing. Corn heterogeneity was taken into account by using different coefficient of diffusivity values for various corn components. To predict stresses, it was assumed that the shape of a kernel remains geometrically similar to its initial shape during drying. Using this assumption a relation between the strain tensor and volume fraction of water was developed. The viscoelastic stress\u2013strain constitutive equation was used to calculate the magnitude of stresses at different spatial locations inside a corn kernel. In the companion paper (part 2), the experimental validation of the solution, simulation results for various drying conditions and the practical implications are discussed.",

Ventilation system hygiene must be regularly cleaning to prevent the build up of dust, product or condensate that may provide a focus for microbial growth. In the present study we predict the particle deposition velocity in ventilation ducts of three different food factories. At these locations, during several days, aerosol particle number and mass size distribution were measured using optical particle counter and cascade impactor, respectively. The concentration of particulate matter of aerodynamic diameters in the size range 0.3\u201320\u00a0\u03bcm varied from 0.2 to 1.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m\u22123. The measured mass concentration and the predicted particle deposition velocity were used to calculate the deposited particle mass flux (DMF) in the ventilation ducts of each site.The results indicate that the DMF at the floor is about 2\u201320 times larger than that at vertical walls. Thus, the deposited particle mass on the floor is sufficient to check whether a ventilation duct should be cleaned. According to the chosen cleaning initiation criteria for ducts, ventilation systems would take approximately 1\u20139\u00a0years to meet the cleaning time. So, cleaning procedures and maintenance intervals are strongly influenced by several parameters, such as flow conditions, particle concentration, characteristics of the ventilation duct and the filter efficiency.

To circumvent these difficulties, an alternative indirect method for determining the characteristic curve over the entire water-content range is proposed. It is based on the hypothesis that the end-parts of this curve, the air-entry value and saturated water content for the wet-end and water sorption isotherm for the dry-end, are relatively easily determined. The predicted characteristic curve was successfully verified for a model food material by comparing it with an independently measured values.

In search of statistical differences between the Ea\u2013kref- and Va\u2013kref-parameters estimated simultaneously, 90% joint confidence regions were constructed. A combined Arrhenius\u2013Eyring model was found suitable to describe the combined temperature\u2013pressure dependence of the degradation rate constants. Cyanidin-3-glucorutinoside showed the slowest degradation in comparison to the other cyanidins. Cyanidin-3-rutinoside experienced the smallest effect of temperature and the strongest effect of pressure compared to the others.",

In this design saturated steam was used as a heating medium. The treatment unit is a double pipe heat exchanger in which the food is pumped in its inner tube, while steam is passed in the annular region to heat the sample. This technology comprises a unique approach of generating a mild pressure (80\u2013100\u00a0MPa) utilizing thermal expansion of the liquid being treated. The results show that this unique application decreased the D-values of Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 spores suspended in soup samples in comparison to thermal treatment alone. The improvement was more significant at lower treatment temperatures. The D-values obtained were in a good agreement with that of the small unit built earlier in which oil was used as a heating medium. The effect of treatment on l-ascorbic acid was similar to that of thermal treatment. The treated samples were subjected to shelf life study by storing them at two different temperatures. No evidence of spore recovery was noted during the post-treatment storage period.",

A metal disc with a known radius creates a small indent in the coating, stopping exactly when the coating thickness is cut through. The indent length is employed to calculate the coating thickness. Accurate measurement of thin films is achieved as the indent is much larger than the respective film thickness. The thickness of epoxy phenolic coatings on tinplate were measured and the results were validated by micrographic cross section analysis and by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The coating thicknesses measured using the indentation method coincide with the film thicknesses measured by CLSM, whereas discrepancies were observed using the micrographic cross section analysis. The new technique, presented in this paper, uses simple equipment, is inexpensive, fast and easy to use, and is suitable for film thickness measurements in laboratories and production plants.",

The performance of different frying surfaces (stainless steel, aluminium, PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) and three ceramic coatings with two different levels of smoothness) were tested at different frying temperatures and rated by a standardised rating procedure. The subjective rating assessment was validated by measuring the force of adhesion. The performances of the surfaces were reproducible and significantly different to be used for screening of new surface coatings for contact frying tested in frying experiments at the same temperature. In contrast, conventional testing in a convection oven could not distinguish between these surfaces. Comparative tests of the ceramic coatings showed that surface roughness had a distinct effect on their non-stick properties, so that the smoother surfaces gave a higher force of adhesion between pancake and surface.",

A systematic study of more than 150 dimensions and various insulator geometries of pilot-scale PEF treatment chambers with co-linear electrode configuration was performed. A reduction of the inner diameter of the insulator and its shape changes the distribution and (average) intensity of the electric field. Both, the average electric field strength of the PEF treatment zone and the actual specific energy input, were significantly lower than the expected values derived from dividing the applied voltage by the electrode gap. The difference between theoretical and actual values generally increased with increasing electrode radius and decreasing electrode gap. The relative ratios of theoretical electric field strength or specific energy input to actual (average) electric field strength or specific energy input showed a linear dependency on the ratio of electrode radius and gap. The determined relationships of specific energy input and treatment chamber dimensions and geometry were experimentally validated in four different PEF treatment chambers.",

Replacement of wheat flour by CMG significantly elevated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) the peak viscosity (128\u2013669\u00a0RVU), hot paste viscosity (77\u2013363\u00a0RVU), breakdown (51\u2013306\u00a0RVU) and final viscosity (157\u2013557\u00a0RVU) of wheat flour pastes.

The textural parameters including hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess and chewiness of the mix gels decreased with higher level of CMG. Freeze\u2013thaw stability measurement revealed that wheat gel mixtures containing higher level (7.5% and 10%) of CMG decreased syneresis more than 80% after 3 freeze\u2013thaw cycles, when compared to non-CMG sample.

     "publication date": "08-2011",
     "abstract": "Pulsed light (PL) technology is able to effectively destroy a wide variety of food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. However, the effectiveness of PL treatment depends on direct exposure of the target microorganisms to the short, high energy pulses of light. The complex physical and chemical properties of foods affect the way light propagates through a given food substrate, and thus there is a real potential for insufficiently or non-uniformly treated products. The objective of this work was to develop a method for predicting levels and spatial distribution of microbial inactivation in PL treatment of liquid substrates, and to validate the predictions with experimental data. Three liquids with different composition and optical properties (BPB, TSB, apple juice) were inoculated with either Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 or Listeria innocua FSL C2-008 and treated with PL, in two different geometries. The Weibull model was used to describe the microbial inactivation kinetics for each organism. The kinetic equations were coupled with previously determined equations describing either the total fluence (Ftotal) or UV fluence (FUV) distribution in each of the liquids, for either cylindrical or rectangular prismatic geometries. COMSOL simulation software was used to generate maps of spatial distribution of microbial inactivation and to predict the average volumetric inactivation for each substrate. The model that used Ftotal provided gross over-estimations for microbial inactivation, while using FUV as the treatment dose yielded reasonably good predictions of microbial inactivation, especially for the more opaque and turbid substrates. This approach can help processors determine which substrates would be suitable for PL treatment, and to design highly effective and uniform PL treatments.",

The strongest gel stiffness was achieved at 0.3\u00a0M NaCl; higher or lower salt concentrations lead to weakening of the gel. The gelation temperature was also influenced by ionic strength; salt had a stabilization effect which inhibited pea protein denaturation at higher salt concentrations resulting in higher gelling points (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). At a NaCl concentration 2.0\u00a0M, pea protein gelation was completely suppressed at temperatures \u2a7d100\u00a0\u00b0C. The pH also played an important role in gel formation by pea protein isolates since acid and base cause partial or even total protein denaturation. In this paper the maximum gel stiffness occurred at pH 4.0 in 0.3\u00a0M NaCl; higher or lower pH values resulted in reduced gel stiffness (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). pH also altered the denaturation temperature of the pea protein; higher pH values resulted in higher denaturation temperatures and higher enthalpies of denaturation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). At pH 3 pea proteins seem like completely denatured by acid as the DSC curve showed a straight line. The gelation temperature (gelling point) peaked at pH \u223c6.0 (89.1\u00a0\u00b0C). Careful adjustment of pH and NaCl concentration would enable the food industry to effectively utilize the salt-extracted pea protein isolate as a gelling agent.",

The 20% addition of CASF produced cookies with greater spread ratio and lower breaking force. Xylanase allowed the amount of CASF to be increased from 20% to 23%, which improved protein and dietary fiber (DF) contents, particularly water-soluble DF, while the spread ratio and breaking force remained unaffected.

The rheological measurements showed that all sauces had a weak gel-like characteristic with strong shear thinning behaviour. In particular, the sauce with the weakest network contained only starch. Flow experimental data, fitted with the Herschel\u2013Bulkley model, also revealed that the sauce with the lowest total solid content had undetectable yield stress, the lowest consistency coefficient, and the highest flow behaviour index, hence the weakest network structure amongst the studied sauces.

Samples of these films were then evaluated for the amount of linalool or methylchavicol retained and for their antimicrobial (AM) activity by the agar disc diffusion assay. In addition, film rolls of LDPE-EVA (LDPE-ethylene vinyl acetate) containing linalool or methylchavicol were stored at 25 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C. Samples of these films were periodically collected to quantify the amount of linalool or methylchavicol retained as a function of time.

For the AM LDPE-EVA films, the amount of additive in the film decreased with time and the additive retention in all films tended to deviate from the theoretical first-order decay. These findings suggest that an amount of linalool or methylchavicol that is sufficient to maintain AM activity remained in the polymeric matrix after the storage period.

Unlike heat or UV processing, where temperature or radiation gradients are established, pressure treatment offers a very rapid establishment of homogeneous conditions as they act instantaneously and uniformly around each single produce or throughout an entire mass of food, independently of its size, shape or composition.A hyperbaric respirometer was designed, built and tested to explore the possibility of using hyperbaric treatment on postharvest commodity. It consisted of an air tight vessel that could be pressurized from 1 to 7\u00a0atm and instrumented to automatically monitor gas concentration along time using computer controlled valves, flow meter and CO2 gas analyzer. Calibration of the system and hyperbaric treatments were performed on tomato fruit to evaluate the performance of the respirometer. Results showed that respiration rate was inversely proportional to pressure application.",

The model proposed relates the freezing point of a juice with the concentrations of main sugars present in the juice: sucrose, glucose and fructose.

Films plasticized with sorbitol exhibited significantly lower WVP, lower MC and higher solubility, in comparison with glycerol-plasticized films. Increasing glycerol content of the films led to increases in WVP and MC but did not affect film solubility. In contrast, increase in sorbitol content had no effect on permeability and MC but resulted in increased film solubility. Moisture sorption isotherms of PPI films suggested that the difference in WVP observed among films plasticized with glycerol and sorbitol might be due to the different hygroscopicity of these plasticizers. The pH of FFS did not have a significant effect on WVP and MC. Solubility of PPI films formed from non-heated FFS was not affected by pH, whereas solubility of films formed from heat-treated FFS generally increased when pH was increased from 7.0 to 11.0. Heating of FFS resulted in improved film transparency. All tested films were characterized by excellent ability to absorb UV radiation. Microstructural observation by scanning electron microscopy did not show differences between sorbitol- and glycerol-plasticized films.",

It was then combined with the relative activation energy (\u0394Ev/\u0394Ev,b) to produce a unique relationship. Results of the modeling indicate that the L-REA can describe the profiles of moisture content and temperature very well. While the results are accurate, the model itself remains simple.

These wet foams (air volume fraction 0.39\u20130.45) showed shear-thinning behaviour at low shear rates (0.1\u201310\u00a0s\u22121), with apparent viscosity dependent on air volume fraction. Simple shear thinning behaviour ceased, for foams, above 10\u201320\u00a0s\u22121: for slurries (air volume fraction, 0.11\u20130.15) the limit approached 100\u00a0s\u22121. Elastic effects, predominantly arising from the bubble phase, therefore dominate cake batter behaviour at the shear rates experienced in commercial mixers. Filament thinning extensional rheometry confirmed the VE behaviour of batters.

Extracts obtained by VMHG, MHG and also conventional solvent extraction method (CSE) were analyzed for quantification of flavonoids by HPLC, along with studying the distribution of flavonoids in different intervals of time at optimised conditions. Two different methods were selected for evaluating the antioxidant capacity of these extracts along with determination of their phenolic content by the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu method: the reduction of the stable DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical and the inhibition of the AAPH-induced peroxidation of linoleic acid in SDS micelles. Reduction of pressure up to 0.7\u00a0bar at microwave power of 500\u00a0W helped to increase the antioxidant activity of onion extracts with 57% increase in total quercetin contents against those obtained at atmospheric pressure. VMHG proved itself an efficient and environment-friendly technique allowing the extraction of flavonols at lower reactor temperature (81\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01), with improved alterations of tissues observed by microscopic studies, from onion by-products just in 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0min, in the absence of any solvent.",

Lean dough pieces (70\u00a0g) were exposed to pre-fermentation at 30\u00a0\u00b0C during selected time to reach expansion ratios of 2, 3 and 4. The pre-fermented dough were exposed to cooling at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Dough pieces were then frozen, thawed and baked.

Results showed that increasing the degree of pre-fermentation results in a reduction in the final dough and bread volume. Freezing applied to pre-fermented dough resulted in a baked bread with larger and less numerous gas cells.

The fish oil with ratio of 33/22, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA):docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is emulsified with four combinations of matrices, and emulsions are dried by spray granulation (SG), spray drying (SD), and freeze drying (FD) to produce 25% oil powders. The objective is to identify the most critical factors to determine powder stability and to further examine the superiority of the SG process compared to other drying processes. The stability is examined by measurement of peroxide values (PV) and GC-headspace propanal after 8-week\u2019s storage at room temperature (\u00b121\u00a0\u00b0C)The best matrices are a combination of 10% soybean soluble polysaccharide (SSPS) and 65% octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA-starch). Microencapsulation of 620\u00a0mg/g omega\u22123 fish oil with these matrices then dried by SG is able to produce powder having a very low propanal content and with a shelf life of 5\u00a0weeks at \u00b121\u00a0\u00b0C. The results indicate that microcapsules produced by SG are actually formed firstly by agglomeration of seed particles. These agglomerated particles are then covered by successive layers. The particle enlargement is determined by mechanism of the layer growth. Therefore, the SG process produces \u201cmultiple encapsulations\u201d granules which provide maximum protection to the oil droplets.Comparison of the SG, SD, and FD processes confirms that combination of matrices, drying temperature, microcapsule morphology, and processing time are among the most critical factors governing stability.

Baking was done at 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min with steaming of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500\u00a0ml. The temperature at center of the bread and the CO2 concentration in the oven have been measured during baking. Specific volume, moisture loss and crust crumb ratio were measured after baking.The heating rate between 35 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C was considered to compare the steaming conditions. For low steaming (100 and 200\u00a0ml), the heating rate was significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than those at higher steaming (400\u2013500\u00a0ml). The heating rate at 300\u00a0ml was between the 100\u2013200 and 400\u2013500\u00a0ml groups. This difference was attributed to the condensation of steam on the loaf for higher steaming, which in turns slows down the heating rate. The largest bread volume was obtained either for low or high steaming. However, tearing of the crust was observed for low steaming. The crust\u2013crumb ratio was increasing with decreasing amount of steaming. The amount of CO2 released during baking was higher for the highest amount of steaming; however, this result was not statistically different except between 100 and 500\u00a0ml. This could be attributed to a slower heating rate which in turns favors the secondary production of CO2 during baking until thermal inactivation of CO2.",

Simulated and experimented temperature profiles (\u00b0C) of wheat flour were compared in four different horizontal layers after 3\u00a0min of RF heating, with a fixed electrode gap of 155\u00a0mm. Both, simulated and experimental results showed that temperature values were higher at the mid layers followed by top and bottom layers. Corners were more heated than centers in each layer. Sensitivity analysis showed that temperature uniformity in the sample was most affected by top electrode voltage and sample dielectric properties.

     "abstract": "The effects of both the electric and flow parameters on the lethality and energy efficiency of a pulsed electric fields (PEF) treatment were studied. An experimental plan was designed in order to study the microbial inactivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli cells inoculated in a buffer solution. The following process parameters were taken into consideration: electric field strength (13\u201330\u00a0kV/cm), total specific energy input (20\u2013110\u00a0J/mL), flow rate of the processed stream (1\u20134 L/h) and number of passes through the chamber (up to 5).The results showed that, at a fixed flow rate (2\u00a0L/h), microbial inactivation of both microbial strains increased with increasing field strength and applied energy input. The maximum inactivation level (5.9 Log-cycles for S. cerevisiae and 7.0 Log-cycles for E. coli) corresponded to the more intensive PEF treatment (30\u00a0kV/cm and 110\u00a0J/mL). However, for any given field strength applied, the inactivation rate decreased by increasing the energy input. This behavior was attributed to the presence of heterogeneous treatment conditions due, for example, to a different morphology (size and shape) or cell membrane (composition, structure), a local variation of the electric field strength in the treatment chamber, the tendency of microbial cells to form clusters, or a non-uniform distribution of the residence time of the product in the PEF chamber.A more effective stirring of the microbial suspensions which was achieved, at a fixed field strength (18\u00a0kV/cm), either by increasing the flow rate with a single pass operation through the PEF chamber, or by operating in re-circulating mode at a constant flow rate, provided a significant increase in the effectiveness and energy efficiency of the pulse treatment.A mathematical model based on the Weibull distribution adequately described the inactivation kinetics of both microbial strains under different flow dynamic conditions.",

Re-moistened waxy rice at an initial moisture content of 28% dry basis (d.b.) was dried at 90\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C. Semi-dried waxy rice was tempered and dried again by ambient air until the moisture content reached 16% (d.b). It was found that the degree of gelatinization increased with an increase in the drying temperature. At 130 and 150\u00a0\u00b0C the appearance of some waxy rice kernels changed from opaque to translucent, indicating complete gelatinization. Thermal degradation of amylopectin granules during high-temperature drying caused the starch to be more rapidly digested; this led to lower peak viscosity and setback viscosity. In addition, waxy rice processed at higher drying temperatures (90\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C) could adsorb more water and exhibited larger loss of solids during soaking. Such effects subsequently led to samples with lower hardness and higher stickiness. Based on the sensory analysis results, however, waxy rice dried at the above temperatures, when cooked, did not significantly differ in overall acceptability from the reference waxy rice.",

Safety issues in these plants are due to the presence of residual volatile flammable solvents deriving from the extraction processes, which may accumulate in the storage tanks and generate flammable vapour mixtures. The methodology, based on the application of a thermodynamic model for the estimation of vapour phase composition in oil storage tanks as a function of operating conditions (i.e. temperature and residual solvent content), allows the identification of potential hazards due to formation of flammable mixtures inside the tanks. The model was first validated using available experimental data and then extended to case-studies representative of state-of-the-art industrial storage applications. The results of the case-studies were then used to calculate specific hazard indexes, providing a quick tool for preliminary assessment of hazards due to the formation of flammable mixtures in edible oil storage plants.",

The kernels were divided into two categories sizes namely: small size kernel (SSK) and large size kernel (LSK) and the properties investigated were: rupture force, deformation at rupture and energy consumed at rupture. The tests were carried out at a deformation rate of 50\u00a0mm/min and four moisture content levels of 25.9%, 11.60%, 6.88%, 4.98% (db) for SSK and 11.19%, 6.21%, 5.78% and 2.77% (db) for LSK. The variations in these properties were observed considering the effects of moisture content and compression axes on them as the kernels were air-dried. Sample kernels were compressed along the orthogonal axes corresponding to major axes (length), intermediate axes (width) and minor axes (thickness) of Shea kernel. Some physical characteristics of Shea kernel such as dimensions, geometric mean diameter and mass were also evaluated. Results showed that generally, rupture force, deformation and energy at rupture decreased as moisture content decreased. The regression models that best fitted the relationships were polynomial functions of the second order. The highest and lowest forces for Shea kernel to rupture were those through the minor axis (thickness) and major axis (length) respectively. These properties are often required for the design of transportation, storage and grading/sorting machines and other post harvest machines for Shea kernel.",

Cups of sweetpotato, red bell pepper, and broccoli acidified to pH 3.8 with citric acid solution containing 0\u20131% NaCl were placed on a conveyor belt and passed through a microwave tunnel operating at 915\u00a0MHz and 4\u00a0kW with a 4\u00a0min residence time. The time\u2013temperature profiles of vegetable pieces at 5 locations in the package were measured using fiber optic temperature sensors. Addition of 1% NaCl to the cover solution lowered microwave penetration into vegetable pieces and decreased the mean temperature in cups of acidified vegetables from 84 to 73\u00a0\u00b0C. Soaking blanched vegetables for 24\u00a0h in a solution with NaCl and citric acid prior to processing improved microwave heating. Heating was non-uniform in all packages with a cold spot of approximately 60\u00a0\u00b0C at a point in the container farthest from the incident microwaves. More uniform heating was achieved by implementation of a two-stage rotation apparatus to rotate vegetable cups 180\u00b0 during processing. Rotating the cups resulted in more uniform heating and a temperature of 77\u00a0\u00b0C at the cold spot. This is above the industrial standard of 74\u00a0\u00b0C for in-pack pasteurization of acidified vegetables. The effective treatment involved blanching, soaking for 24\u00a0h in a NaCl and citric acid solution, and 180\u00b0 rotation. This work has contributed to a better understanding of the influence of salt addition and distribution during dielectric heating of acidified vegetables using a 915\u00a0MHz continuous microwave system.",

In fact, as the OD proceeds, the dielectric characteristics of the solution, associated to the reflectometry measurements, can be directly related to the variation of the water activity (aw), which is the parameter that is typically considered to assess the dewatering capacity of the solution. As a result, through the method presented herein, a continuous monitoring of the dewatering capacity of the osmotic solution, associated to its qualitative status, is possible, which, in turn, is useful also for optimizing the OD industrial process.

     "abstract": "Superheated steam has received much attention as an effective technique for drying purposes because it produces dried products with high quality attributes. Although currently there are a number of works reporting the development of a mathematical model of superheated steam drying, they do not use a numerical method to estimate the effective moisture diffusivity value (Deff value) of the product. The purposes of this work, therefore, were to develop a semi-empirical model for estimating the Deff value of pork, and for predicting the evolution of the moisture content and the center temperature of sliced pork during superheated steam drying. The model was based on mass and energy-balance equations and was divided into three periods: heating up, constant drying rate and falling drying rate period. It was solved using an explicit finite difference method and used a grid search method to estimate the Deff value of pork.

The comparison results showed that the developed model could estimate the ranges of the Deff value of pork fairly well (Deff\u00a0=\u00a03.311\u201312.471\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0m2/s for seasoned pork, and 4.200\u201315.056\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0m2/s for unseasoned pork) and could reasonably predict the evolution of the moisture content of the sliced pork. The predicted center temperature of the sliced pork was higher than the experimental data in the heating up period and in the first 5\u00a0min of the falling drying rate period, but it agreed well in the constant drying rate period and after the drying time of 10\u00a0min. Moreover, it was found that the slice thickness and the seasoning had an influence on the drying curves only in the constant drying rate and falling drying rate period.",

A central composite (CC) design was applied as a tool to obtain a stable and low viscosity emulsion.

The factors investigated were sample size, shape, relative position between the RF electrodes, and dielectric properties (DPs) of the sample and the surrounding medium. Effects of electrode gap and top electrode configuration on the RF power distribution behavior of the sample were also studied. The RF power uniformity in the samples was compared using RF power density uniformity index (PUI). Simulated results showed that the RF power uniformity in cuboid shaped samples, placed on the bottom electrode, first decreased and then increased with the increase in sample size. The sample shape and its vertical position between the fixed gap parallel plate electrodes also affected the RF power distribution and uniformity. A cuboid sample had higher RF power densities at the edges, while an ellipsoid had higher power densities in the center parts. Simulated results showed that the smaller values of DPs resulted in better RF power uniformities in the samples. Reducing the electrode gap improved the RF power uniformity of the sample. While studying the influence of the top electrode configuration on the RF power distribution and uniformity, the results showed that optimum RF power uniformity in a particular sample size could be achieved with a particular top electrode bending position and angle.

Foams and aerated emulsions showed significant elastic behaviour with G\u2032\u223cG\u2033. The temperature dependency of aerated emulsions was studied by oscillatory shear testing from 20 to 100\u00a0\u00b0C and indicated three regimes in temperature dependence: below 40\u00a0\u00b0C G\u2032and G\u2033 were insensitive to temperature; between 40 and 70\u00a0\u00b0C the complex viscosity exhibited Arrhenius-type behaviour, while above 70\u00a0\u00b0C G\u2032 and G\u2033 increased as expected for gelatinisation and foam setting.

The concentration of Tween 20 was shown to be a key parameter affecting the droplet size of the emulsion at the early stages of processing (within the first 3\u00a0min). However, during the later stages of processing, hydrodynamic conditions have a more pronounced effect on determining the final droplet size.

The freeze grinding process involved soaking the rice samples in liquid nitrogen before grinding in a dry grinding machine. Three different types of grinders (hammer mill, roller mill, and pin mill) were used in both the freeze and the dry grinding processes. Wet grinding resulted in significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) smaller average particle size and a lower percentage of damaged starch than the alternative methods of grinding. Freeze grinding, especially using the hammer mill significantly reduced both the average particle size and the damaged starch content. Moreover, freeze grinding produced a higher yield after sieving in comparison with dry grinding using an identical grinder. In particular, freeze grinding with the hammer mill gave a significantly higher yield after sieving than dry grinding with the hammer mill. The wet grinding process had the significantly highest specific energy consumption (13,868\u00a0kJ/kg) due to the large consumption of electrical energy by the many machines in the process. The energy consumption of freeze grinding was similar to dry grinding. Consequently, the freeze grinding process was a viable alternative to the traditional wet grinding process.",

     "abstract": "Continuous monitoring of food properties during drying is of stark relevance for the food processing industry. The main task of this research is to apply laser backscattering technology to simultaneously predict variations in hardness, moisture content and soluble solids content (SSC) of apples during drying. A laser diode with a wavelength of 635\u00a0nm was used to non-destructively analyze photon migration in the apple tissue. The backscattering area in pixel numbers, representing the illuminated area after laser light injection, and light luminescence measured by grey values were used for estimating changes in internal quality parameters during drying. A decrease in moisture content caused a reduction in photon scattering determined by diminished light propagation in the fruit tissue. Additionally, scattering images showed less photon migration as the SSC increased due to the light absorption of light at 635\u00a0nm by fruit compounds. To estimate moisture content, calibration models gave the highest coefficients of determination (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.8 and 0.89) with standard errors of cross validation (SECV) of 11.6 and 9.8 for backscattering area and light luminescence, respectively. However, predictions obtained for SSC were slightly lower. Laser light measurement at 635\u00a0nm was found to be adequate for predicting changes in moisture content and SSC of apple during drying over different stages. On the contrary, photon scattering at 635\u00a0nm is not recommended as estimator of change in hardness during apple drying, based on the results.",

In this study, a laboratory produced heat induced whey protein gels (HIWPG) and a pilot plant heat exchanger fouling/cleaning were used to investigate the effect of protein concentration on formation and cleaning of dairy fouling. Here, HIWPGs made from different protein concentrations were formed in capsules and then dissolved in aqueous sodium hydroxide (0.5\u00a0wt%). The dissolution rate calculation based on the UV spectrophotometer analysis. In the pilot-scale plant study, whey protein fouling deposits were formed by recirculating whey protein solutions with different concentrations through the heat exchange section in different runs, respectively. The deposit layers were then removed by recirculating aqueous sodium hydroxide (0.5\u00a0wt%) and the cleaning efficiency was monitored in the form of the recovery of heat transfer coefficient while both fluid electric conductivity and turbidity were monitored as indications of cleaning completion. It was found that increasing the protein concentration of the HIWPG significantly increased the gel hardness and the dissolution time. In addition, increasing the protein concentration significantly increased both, the amount of the fouling on the pilot-scale plant and the time required to clean the fouling deposit.",

The compacted masses are examined for density and different textural parameters (linear limit of deformation and modulus of deformability, and failure properties like failure stress/energy/strain) employing uniaxial compression.An increase in sugar and PGS markedly increases the failure stress, energy for failure and modulus of deformability while showing a reverse trend for oil added samples.

The pressure level ranged from 50 to 250\u00a0MPa, the number of passes from 1 to 5 and the inlet temperature from 2 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C.Preliminary tests in distilled water showed that the efficiency of the multiple-pass treatment significantly depends on both the homogenizing pressure as well as the microbial species. The subsequent extension of the multiple-pass treatment to the inactivation of S. cerevisiae inoculated into three different fruit juices (orange, red-orange and pineapple juice) highlighted that the inactivation induced by the high pressure treatment did not depend on the properties of the tested juices and was not statistically different from inactivation in water (p value\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These findings were supported by the comparison of two different mathematical models used to fit the inactivation kinetics, whose fitting parameters were not significantly different for water and the fruit juices for any pressure level applied.Three homogenization passes at 150\u00a0MPa and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, which resulted to be optimal for yeast inactivation in fruit juices, were effective for the stabilization of the endogenous microbial load of fresh Annurca apple juice.

The CFD code \u201cFluent\u00ae\u201d was used to predict the temperature distribution and the velocity profile in the can. Experiments were run using a metal can containing 1 and 8 asparaguses filled with 4% NaCl brine and immersed in boiling water. Results obtained by CFD for temperature profiles were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. After validation of the model, further simulations were carried out for cans containing 0, 1, 8 and 19 asparaguses and for glass jars containing 19 asparaguses. It was shown that the brine flow depends on the number and spacing of the asparaguses in the can. By increasing the number of asparaguses in the can, the brine velocity increased being higher at the beginning of the heating and cooling phases. The slowest heating zone and the slowest cooling zone are located at a height of about 13.5% of the can height from the bottom and about 13.5% of the can height from the top, respectively, and they are not affected by the number of asparaguses. The final temperature during the heating phase was slightly affected by the number of asparaguses, while the heating rate was affected by the type of the container. Brine velocity did not affect the temperature inside the asparaguses indicating that the main resistance to heat transfer lies inside the asparaguses. The results clearly show that heating of the asparaguses is not uniform but the top of the asparaguses receives higher heat treatment than the bottom since the top of the can is heated faster and is cooled at a slower rate. These results could contribute to the optimization of thermal processing of asparaguses in order to minimize quality losses, such as texture, flavor and nutritional value, while keeping the product safe.",

In this work, the effects of variations in inputs for compression fluid properties and process conditions (i.e., the applied pressure profiles) on the prediction accuracy of a CFD model for a Stansted 3.6 L Isolab HPTS system were studied. Good agreement was found between simulated and measured temperature distributions when accurate compression heating coefficients for the compressed materials and actual pressure profiles were used as inputs of the model. Inaccurate approximations of these values and conditions resulted in much less useful models, highlighting the importance of attention to detail in input data for CFD models of HPT processing, in these still early stages of development of the technology.",

All laboratory baked breads with barley additives, except normal barley flour, were less firm after 7\u00a0days of storage as compared to the control although amylopectin retrogradation tended to increase. Improved water absorption, and consequently, increased water content and/or different water binding capacities of the flour/starch could explain these results.

     "abstract": "Computer-aided engineering tools can help speed up food product, process and equipment design by making it easier to check \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios, much as such tools have improved productivity in other industries. In particular, food safety is a critical area where such predictive tools can have great impact. A realistic, integrated and comprehensive software has been developed that can simulate a food process and its safety by combining a fundamental, physics-based model of the process with the kinetics of microbiological and chemical changes during processing to provide needed information at any time and at any location in the food during processing. Compositions for a large number of foods are integrated into the software, and therefore, composition-based prediction of thermophysical properties, needed for the model, can be obtained. Microbiological and chemical kinetic databases that are also built-in can cover many practical situations, based on the grouping of foods. An intuitive graphical user interface has been built with those in the food sector in mind.",

Oil migration kinetics was monitored using a novel pipette technique while diffusion and counter-diffusion were measured using gas chromatography. Tempering significantly lowered (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) the peanut oil diffusion in the samples but did not influence the counter-diffusion of cocoa butter in peanut oil. Addition of cocoa powder at a volume fraction of 0.45 significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) peanut oil diffusion and decreased counter-diffusion. Due to the ingress of peanut oil, the solid fat content of tempered and untempered cocoa butter samples dropped from 75% to 59% after 7\u00a0weeks and resulted in corresponding dimensional changes in the samples which were also measured using image analysis. Diffusion, counter-diffusion and lipid phase changes were combined to develop a mass balance model to predict the volume changes occurring during oil migration.",

Oil was extracted from soy flour and rice bran at various time\u2013temperature combinations with an ethanol: feedstock ratio of 3:1. Both processes were optimized to minimize extraction time while maximizing the quantity of oil extracted. Extraction yields were compared to conventional (CE) and Soxhlet extraction. Yields in the laboratory-scale system for soybean oil were highest at the highest temperature (73\u00a0\u00b0C) and longest exposure time (21\u00a0min), while for rice bran oil, the highest yields were obtained at 73\u00a0\u00b0C and 17\u00a0min. Using the pilot-scale extraction system, greater than 93.0% of total recoverable oil was extracted from both feedstock at all tested flow rates and extraction times, more than the oil recovered by the laboratory-scale unit. Time of extraction and flow rate did not have a significant influence on extraction yield at tested temperatures for the pilot-scale process for soybeans. For rice bran, extraction yield decreased slightly with increasing flow rate (from 0.6 to 1.0\u00a0l/min) and extraction time also influenced oil yields. Analysis of oil quality indices (IV, AV, FFA content, wax and phospholipids) extracted by both CMAE processes indicate that the oil meets prescribed biodiesel feedstock quality standards, further justifying use of microwaves as a rapid tool for oil extraction.",

It has been demonstrated that the dielectric properties are a good tool to control the surface water activity by using the loss factor at relaxation frequency. This relation of dielectric properties with the water activity allows controlling the shrinkage level and determines the moment when the driving forces change from diffusional to mechanical behaviors. This value corresponds to 12.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 and represents a practical control value to decide if the final dehydrated samples shrink or swell.

The middle stage of the drying process shows a faster drying rate and accelerated moisture evaporation. Meanwhile, more flavors are lost, surface color is degraded, and charring often occurs in this stage. To improve the drying effects, drying curves were controlled and changed in this study. The drying curve was linearized by automatically varying drying temperatures in the middle stages. The controlled drying process therefore led to an optimized temperature profile. To simplify the drying methods, apples were further dried with the obtained temperature profile, while drying curves were online monitored but not controlled. It was proved that slowing down the drying rate in the middle stage could improve the product quality in terms of color, flavor, and overall appearance, while the drying time and energy consumption were still acceptable (within 200\u00a0min and 22\u00a0kJ/g, respectively).",

     "abstract": "The feasibility of utilizing infrared spectroscopy for the prediction of haze formation in white wines resulting from heat and colloidal stability tests was investigated. One-hundred eleven white wines, representing multiple regions and varieties from the 2008 California vintage, were collected and analyzed. The near and mid-infrared spectra were measured and heat and colloidal (ethanol addition) stability tests were performed on the same wines. Partial-least squares regression analysis was then used to construct models predictive of the resulting nepholometric turbidity to the acquired spectra. Preliminary models obtained following application of spectral pretreatments today considered as \u201cclassical\u201d (e.g., derivatives, standard normal variate, vector normalization, constant offset elimination) lacked robustness; two alternative algorithms designed to remove spectral information unrelated to the turbidity were then employed (orthogonal signal correction; direct orthogonal signal correction). While OSC pretreatment did not result in more robust models, DOSC considerably enhanced the goodness of the PLS model constructed to predict the ethanol test turbidity. Predictive modeling of the short-NIR spectra, following DOSC preprocessing, allowed the prediction of colloidal stability on an unknown test set with an R2\u00a0=\u00a00.80 and a RMSEP\u00a0=\u00a010.12 using three latent variables.

The effect of heat-moisture treatment (HMT) on morphology, structure, and physicochemical properties of those starches was investigated. The HMT did not change the size, shape, and surface characteristics of corn and potato starch granules, while surface change/partial gelatinization was found on the granules of rice starches. The X-ray diffraction pattern of normal and waxy potato starches was shifted from B- to C-type by HMT. The crystallinity of the starch samples, except waxy potato starch decreased on HMT. The viscosity profiles changed significantly with HMT. The treated starches, except the waxy potato starch, had higher pasting temperature and lower viscosity. The differences in viscosity values before and after HMT were more pronounced in normal starches than in waxy starches, whereas changes in the pasting temperature showed the reverse (waxy\u00a0>\u00a0normal). Shifts of the gelatinization temperature to higher values and gelatinization enthalpy to lower values as well as biphasic endotherms were found in treated starches. HMT increased enzyme digestibility of treated starches (except waxy corn starch); i.e., rapidly and slowly digestible starches increased, but resistant starch decreased. Although there was no absolute consistency on the data obtained from the three pairs of waxy and normal starches, in most cases the effects of HMT on normal starches were more pronounced than the corresponding waxy starches.",

     "abstract": "The effects of proteins and low molecular weight surfactants (LMS) on spray drying and powder characteristics of model sugar-rich foods have been studied. Fructose and sucrose were selected as model sugar-rich foods and sodium caseinate (NaCas) was selected as a model protein. Sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) and Polysorbate 80 (Tween-80) were chosen as model ionic and non-ionic low molecular weight surfactants. The feed solutions for spray drying had 25% solid concentration in all. To achieve identical powder recoveries of the order of 80% much higher NaCas:fructose ratio (30:70) was required compared to NaCas:sucrose ratio (0.5:99.5) which corresponded to 7.89% and 0.13% of sodium caseinate (initial bulk concentration), respectively. There was no change in powder recovery when the SSL concentration was increased from 0.01% to 0.05% in fructose\u2013NaCas\u2013SSL solution and also addition of 0.01% Tween-80 into fructose\u2013NaCas solution did not affect the powder recovery (76.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3%), however, it was slightly affected with the increase of Tween-80 to 0.05% (69.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9%). At NaCas concentration above critical micelle concentration of NaCas (>3% w/w), the presence of up to 0.05% low molecular weight surfactants had either no effect or minimal effect on the surface coverage of the droplets/particles and also on the powder recovery depending on the nature of the low molecular weight surfactants. The surface protein coverage and the recovery of the powder in sucrose\u2013protein systems were very sensitive in the presence of low molecular weight surfactants due to being below the critical micelle concentration of NaCas. SSL displaced 2.0% and 29.3% of proteins from the droplet surface of sucrose\u2013NaCas\u2013SSL, respectively, when its concentration was varied from 0.01% to 0.05% thereby reducing the powder recovery from 75.5% to 30%. The addition of 0.01% Tween-80 in sucrose\u2013NaCas solution resulted in a 48.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5% reduction in powder recovery and at 0.05% concentration, it displaced a substantial amount of NaCas from the droplet surface and no powder was recovered. These phenomena are explained on the basis of surface-glass transition temperature, dynamic surface tension, nature of surfactants and glass transition temperature of sugars used. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy results showed that the powders of sucrose\u2013NaCas, sucrose\u2013NaCas with 0.01% SSL and all powders of fructose were amorphous.",

Non-linear regression was used to fit the experimental data to the models used to describe oil absorption in potato chips with time.Moisture content, oil content, microstructure, diameter and thickness expansion, bulk density, true density, and porosity of chips fried at different temperatures (120, 130, and 140\u00a0\u00b0C) was performed to evaluate the effect of process temperature on the product.

The frozen hams were simultaneously thawed and salted with saturated brine for periods of 3, 5, and 7\u00a0days with and without the application of a vacuum pulse in order to reach the same salt concentration as the traditional procedure. The post-salting behaviour of the brine/thawed hams was also studied. The results obtained indicated that simultaneous thawing and salting would considerably reduce the time needed to reach the same salt concentration as with the traditional procedure (77% and 63% reduction with and without vacuum pulse, respectively). This also implied lower dehydration, so an increase in the post-salting time or in the weight lost during this stage is required.",

     "abstract": "Commercialization of UV-C treatment of horticultural produce in order to induce beneficial responses in the produce following treatment requires both accurate dose delivery and a method of treating large quantities of produce efficiently. Furthermore, it has long been assumed that such effects require the entire surface of the horticultural commodities \u2013 typically fruit \u2013 to be exposed to UV-C. This has invariably been achieved by manually rotating the fruit in a UV-C field whilst reducing the dose delivered at each rotation in direct proportion to the number of rotations. However, the resulting UV-C dose distributions achieved under these circumstances are generally not reported in the literature. In the work described here a polystyrene sphere (dia. 70\u00a0mm) was used to simulate fruits such as tomatoes, apples, peaches, etc., that have an approximately spherical form in order to provide a means of measuring the total doses of UV-C accumulated during treatment and comparing such estimates to theoretically-derived ones. This was achieved using dosimetry based on spores of Bacillus subtilis in which spore-impregnated membranes were attached to the surface of the sphere. The fraction of spores surviving exposure was used to estimate dose from a dose\u2013response curve for the spores. Under irradiation conditions leading to a theoretically calculated dose of 10.6\u00a0J, spore dosimetry yielded estimates of 9.1, 10.7 and 6.1\u00a0J for UV-C delivered in, respectively, one, two or four exposures. In the case of exposure of the sphere during continuous mechanical rotation for the same length of time (80\u00a0s) a value of only 3.5\u00a0J was obtained. Irradiation conditions resulting in the spores being subject to intermittent exposure to UV-C led to dose estimates below the theoretically derived ones. The circumstances under which spore dosimetry can be used to obtain surface dose distributions are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Near-infrared radiation was combined with fluidized-bed drying to reduce the cracking and breakage of soybean grains because of its advantages such as a decrease in the moisture gradient and the stresses development within the grain kernel, leading to high quality of product. Physical qualities, i.e. cracking, breakage and colour, were investigated together with microstructure of soybean grains. Protein solubility and urease activity were also determined. The parameters studied were near-infrared radiation powers of 4, 6 and 8\u00a0kW, air velocity of 4.5\u00a0m/s, air temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C and grain bed depth of 6\u00a0cm. Results showed that the drying rate was increased with the increase of near-infrared radiation power. The moisture content was reduced from an initial moisture content of 20% d.b. to the final moisture contents of 13.5% d.b. (4\u00a0kW), 12.8% d.b. (6\u00a0kW) and 12.5% d.b. (8\u00a0kW). The cracking and breakage of soybean grains occurred negligible, which was lower than 4.4% and 5.3% for cracking and breakage, respectively. At near-infrared radiation powers of 4 and 6\u00a0kW was accepted for both soybean grains trade and animal feed industries in Thailand. The total colour difference changes (\u0394E) were varied in the range of to 2.9\u20134.2. The protein solubility of final product was in an acceptable range (77\u201382%) for feed meal. The reduction of residual urease was varied in the range of to 39\u201370%.

Significant correlations were observed between the NMR relaxation parameters and all physicochemical quality properties measured, except the cooking yield, when samples from all processing stages were analyzed together. The longitudinal relaxation time T1, and the faster relaxing transverse relaxation time T21 were shown to be especially sensitive to protein denaturation in the fillets. The water distribution indicated that the salting and rehydration processes changed the cells irreversibly.

Regression analysis of the peaks of the time response starting at 50\u00a0ms following the trigger yielded an exponential tendency line that indicates the decay rate of vibration theory. Distinct vibration analysis revealed that a decay below 80 represents complete gelling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis reveals an area under curve of 0.963, a cut-off point at 0.000 (x axis) and 0.882 (y axis), and a decay rate of 84.7995. The accuracy was 96.7%.

The most appropriate theoretical models were obtained and applied for combined processes in order to minimize the overall drying time and avoid final product damage. For parsley at the highest temperature (45\u00a0\u00b0C), reductions of 63% and 16% in drying time were observed with the combined drying process compared to the sole convective and sole vacuum drying, respectively. This reduction in process time was obtained when dryer change was done at the intermediate moisture condition that determines the highest drying rate during the whole combined process of convective and vacuum drying. For mushrooms, convective drying throughout the process, at the highest temperature (55\u00a0\u00b0C) compatible with product visual quality, minimized drying time.",

All ingredients and pre-crystallisation techniques considered proved to have a large impact on fat crystallisation kinetics and the resulting microstructure. Seeded samples tended to form multiple nucleation sites, inducing rapid growth of a crystal network. The non-seeded samples showed an altering structure, with some domains developing large spherical crystals while in other domains a more heterogeneous microstructure resulted. Lecithin showed a remarkable impact on crystallisation kinetics in both the seeded and non-seeded samples.

In addition, the performance of the SVM model in terms of iteration time and the number of support vectors was better than the PC-SVM model.

An experimental design was drawn up, associated with an estimate of the velocities of each component by means of kinetic monitoring. High mass yields (mass gain >0.3\u00a0kg\u00a0kg\u22121), obtained for the marinades most dilute in acid, were found only in the absence of NaCl. The presence of NaCl had a negative effect on mass yield, counterbalanced by the positive effect of acetic acid. In the case of acidic marinades with low salt concentration, high solute flux densities were observed upon the start of immersion, as well as solute transfer velocities greater than those in water. This phenomenon may be explained by the superimposition of material diffusion and transport phenomena caused by a fall in internal filtration pressure due to expansion of the protein matrix. The fall in the buffering capacity of the meat in the course of soaking, related to the leakage of proteins, dipeptides and lactates, may explain the low pH values obtained during immersion in comparison with theoretical data.",

For an energy saving point of view, enhancement of the energy transfer with a passive technique would be precious considering high air velocity being exerted in such system. The objective of this investigation was to demonstrate that a modified slot-jet impingement system with additional horizontal and vertical plates could enhance the overall heat transfer (Nu\u00a0=\u00a0Nusselt number) over the target impinging surface. The demonstration involved published experimental data and computational fluid dynamics simulations in evaluation of various positions of the horizontal (s\u00a0=\u00a0horizontal plate height) and vertical (L\u00a0=\u00a0distance from nozzle edge to vertical plate) plates. It was found that the s value has a stronger effect on the heat (Nu) distribution profiles on the target surface than that of the L value. The presence of the plates introduced more than one peak of Nu values. Only s\u00a0=\u00a0L\u00a0=\u00a00.5W (W\u00a0=\u00a0slot width) offered an excellent enhancement of heat transfer over that of the control (no plates) in the stagnation and wall-jet regions. Moreover, jet streamlines/recirculation and velocity vector on the y-axis at y\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.95W were well related to the surface Nu distribution profiles. It was demonstrated that a proper design of the plate position significantly enhanced the overall energy transfer on the target surface and improved the cooling rate of food model.",

The scheduling algorithms are each illustrated without undue technical detail. Reversal in the priority order of sample pipetting and the, related, plate labelling process, results in a 22% efficiency gain. Similarly, co-ordination of the production schedule of the agar in which the samples are grown, with the test sample sequence, substantially reduces agar requirement and wastage. The overall effect on the entire process is to allow continuous testing throughout the day and an increase in the capacity of the laboratory of over 20%, with no additional staff or capital investment.",

The X-ray analysis showed that high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment converted starch that displayed the C-type X-ray pattern to the B-type-like pattern. The HHP treatments altered the shape of starch granules and changed their surface appearance according to SEM analysis.

The results show that ultrasonic excitation significantly reduces cutting force, that the magnitude of cutting force reduction largely depends on the product, and that cutting force and cutting work increase with increasing cutting velocity.

This paper deals with the effect of process conditions on both the dehydration kinetics and the final quality of banana osmotically dehydrated. Banana slices (5\u00a0mm thick, 23\u00a0mm diameter) were osmotically dehydrated for 4\u00a0h, following a 32 full factorial design (temperature (30, 40, and 50\u00a0\u00b0C), sucrose concentration (45, 55 and 65% w/w)) with experiments in triplicate. The kinetics of dehydration efficiency (DE) and mass loss (DM) and the quality of osmotic dehydrated banana, was analysed through the measurement of colour, final volume (V/V0) and shape changes (SF).Both temperature and sucrose concentration in the osmotic solution had a significant effect on DE but had no significant effect on DM. Peleg\u2019s equation fitted well the data for DM and DE during OD. Sucrose concentration and temperature, had no significant effect on DM after 4\u00a0h OD or at the equilibrium mass loss (DMe) (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), however, temperature had a significant effect on the initial rate of DM (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Sucrose concentration and temperature, had no significant effect on the colour parameters (L, Chroma and Hue), but showed a significant effect on V/V0 and SF, with temperature having a more extensive negative impact on V/V0 and SF than sucrose concentration. Process temperature (low temperature, e.g., 30\u00a0\u00b0C) has to be carefully selected in order to reach a compromise between OD rate and an appropriate final product quality. The reduction in the kinetics caused by low temperature could be compensated by using highly concentrated sucrose solutions (as much as 65%), which would favour the compositional changes with a lesser impact on the product quality.",

     "abstract": "This paper introduces a new methodology for modeling traceability information using the EPCIS framework and UML statecharts. The method follows the approach of defining states and transitions in food production. A generic model is presented and evaluated based on its practical application by providing illustrations from two supply chains; frozen mackerel production and corn wet milling processes. All states and transitions for these processes as well as the information that needs to be captured for each state are indentified. This includes the product, process and quality information. The model presented in this paper is not just another process modeling tool but is used for mapping of food production processes to provide improved description and integration of traceability information. Information exchange technologies such as EPCIS are used for monitoring events based on logistic processes. Application of current EPCIS framework for managing food traceability information is presented by mapping the transitions identified in two product chains to the EPCIS events. The corresponding quality parameters to be linked to these EPCIS events are also identified. It was practical to map food production transitions for frozen mackerel to two EPCIS events; ObjectEvent and AggregationEvent. Because, EPCIS is based on discrete recording of events and event locations and corn wet milling is a continuous process, it was not possible to map transitions to AggregationEvent. Thus, quality parameters for transformation events for corn wet milling were linked to the subsequent ObjectEvent to provide certain extent of discretization.",

A sterilised medium was initially used as a model system for assessing the potential of these microorganisms in batch and fed-batch cultures with re-neutralisation. In all cases, batch cultivations without re-neutralisation led to the highest production and yields of the main metabolites of LAB fermentation (lactic and acetic acids). The dynamics of these metabolites followed a conversion pattern from lactic to acetic acid with a final joint concentration over 16\u00a0g/L and final pH lower than 4.5. Both productions were modelled by means of logistic modified equations. In addition, the capability of LAB to ferment the fish visceral wastes was always high and easily reproducible. Finally, the results obtained for non-sterilised fermentations with Lactobacillus casei CECT 4043 were similar to those obtained for sterilised media, and a stable material was obtained after 72\u00a0h of culture.",

     "abstract": "Instant rice produced from a conventional process consisting of the cooking, washing and drying steps possesses poorer eating quality compared with that of freshly cooked rice. The objective of this work was therefore to study the effects of cooking, pretreatment and drying methods on microstructure, textural properties and starch digestability of instant rice after rehydration; jasmine white rice was chosen as a test material. Conventional boiling method and electric rice cooking were selected as the methods to prepare cooked rice. In the case of boiling, cooked rice was frozen at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C or cooled at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h prior to drying, while the cooked rice from an electric rice cooker was washed with ambient or cool water for 30\u00a0s prior to drying. After pretreatment the cooked rice was dried either by freeze drying or hot air drying at 80\u00a0\u00b0C. Based on the scanning electron microscopic results it was found that the cooking, pretreatment and drying methods all affected the rice morphology. The hardness and stickiness of instant rice after rehydration were lower for samples prepared from the rice cooker than those of freshly cooked rice, while both textural properties appeared to be improved significantly for the samples from boiling. The texture of the freeze-dried products was not different from that of the air-dried one. The freezing pretreatment provided the texture and glycemic index of instant rice after rehydration similar to those of the freshly cooked rice. On the other hand, the cooling pretreatment resulted in the harder texture and higher glycemic index of the samples.",

The contact between cell and compression probe was modelled using a soft contact boundary condition. The cytoplast was represented as an internal pressure acting on the plasma lemma and cell wall. Assuming linear elastic constitutive behaviour for the cell wall, and using previously determined cell wall material parameters, the model was found to be remarkably capable of reproducing the force\u2013deformation behaviour of a single cell in compression, as well as its deformed shape, even for large strains.

By submitting each fruit to different engineering strains (\u03b5z) along the z-axis in the range of 3\u201321% of the initial fruit height, the momentary contact area of each fruit under testing was precisely determined by approximating its outline to a polygon and reconstructing it via the Elliptic Fourier Analysis, or an ellipse inscribed in a bounding box. Both estimates yielded no statistically significant difference and varied linearly with \u03b5z. Their prediction using the ASABE Standard Method (2008), or assuming no variation in the volume of the fruit undergoing compression, resulted be under- or over-estimated by 45% or 19%, respectively. Use of image analysis allowed the apparent Poisson\u2019s ratio and modulus of deformability (EO) of the whole orange fruit to be estimated as equal to 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 and 353\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0kPa, respectively.By assimilating the orange fruit to a deformable membrane (flavedo) filled with an internal incompressible juice, it was possible to estimate the compressive stress acting on the equatorial horizontal cross-section of the epicarp only and thus estimate the apparent modulus of elasticity of the orange peel (=375\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033\u00a0kPa), and a burst pressure of 533\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0103\u00a0kPa at a rupture strain \u03b5zR of 0.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 for rind thicknesses ranging from 0.8 to 4.0\u00a0mm.",

The inclusion of guar gum did not decrease starch digestibility; rather, at 10% guar gum rapidly digestible starch increased by 24%, 15%, 25% and 43%, in maize, potato, rice and wheat flour-based products, respectively. In general, increases in starch digestibility appear to be related to the weaker microstructure (i.e., lower textural hardness), larger matrix surface area, and lower viscosity (pasting properties) of extrudates containing guar gum. These results suggest that microstructural changes affect the starch digestibility of extrudates; nevertheless, probably other factors such as particle size during digestion may also play an important role.",

Analyses provided quantitative and qualitative evidence that the initial manufacturing stage (peak-1) was concerned with water uptake and the formation of a hydrated casein matrix, as \u223c75% of the added water was absorbed. This was followed by a fat emulsification phase (trough) and, once sufficiently emulsified, by the incorporation of the fat to form a homogeneous cheese mass, at peak-2.

In vitro dissolution tests, using a pH-change method, were carried out to investigate the influence of formulative parameters on flavonoid release from the microparticles. Presence of a combination of CAP and surfactants or swelling agents in the formulations produced microparticles with good resistance at low pH of the gastric fluid and complete flavonoid release in the intestinal environment. The spray-drying technique and the process conditions selected have given satisfying encapsulation efficiency and product yield.

Firstly, the adulterant agent concentration is determined using the density and/or refractive indices (RIs) of adulterated samples of EVOO with sunflower (SO) or corn (CO) oils by suitable linear correlations between density and/or RI. Finally, models based on the combination of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) equipment and a chaotic parameter (lag-k autocorrelation coefficients, LCCs) is defined here to quantify adulterations of EVOO with refined olive (ROO), refined olive pomace (ROPO), SO or CO oils. This quantification was carried out using successful linear correlation of LCCs and ROO, ROPO, SO or CO concentrations in 462 adulterated samples of EVOO. The LCCs are calculated from DSC scans of adulterated EVOO samples. In both models studied, the adulterant agent concentrations are less than 14% w/w. The former is adequate to calculate the concentration of the adulterant agents (CO and SO) with a correlation coefficient (R2) higher than 0.927 and mean square error (MSE) lower than 8.9%. By the external validation process, the LCC/DSC approach estimates the adulterant agent concentrations with a R2 (estimated vs. real adulterant agent concentration) greater than 0.921 and a MSE less than 4.9%.",

     "abstract": "A method for real-time, in situ measurement of oxygen transport across oil-in-water emulsion interface was developed. This method is based on reversible fluorescence quenching of tris ruthenium (II) bis (hexafluorophosphate) complex dye encapsulated in the oil phase of an emulsion upon interaction with oxygen. Oxygen transport across the oil\u2013water interface for four different emulsions (whey protein isolate (WPI), sodium-dodecyl sulphate (SDS), cross-linked WPI and SDS\u2013chitosan emulsions) was measured and effective diffusion coefficients were calculated. Results show that cross-linking of WPI did not alter the oxygen transport rate (p\u00a0>\u00a00.01), while addition of a chitosan layer to the SDS emulsion significantly reduced the oxygen transport rate (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). An increase in temperature from 25 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C reduced the oxygen transport rate in WPI and cross-linked WPI emulsions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Effective diffusion coefficient values for transport of oxygen based on fluorescence data were 0.14\u20131.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212\u00a0cm2/s for the tested emulsions. Regardless of relatively low effective diffusion coefficients, the selected emulsions exhibited poor barrier properties in limiting oxygen transport across an emulsion interface. In summary, this rapid method is sensitive to detect changes in rate of oxygen transport due to changes in temperature and chemical composition of emulsion interface. This method can be used to screen and evaluate the barrier properties of encapsulation matrices leading to rational design of encapsulated structures.",

In this study a plastic scale model of a HPH was made, allowing the visualization of drop deformation and break-up. Great care was taken to keep the relevant dimensionless numbers constant during the scaling-up. The experimental data were interpreted in terms of theoretical drop break-up theory. It was found that both viscous and inviscid mechanisms can deform the drop. When a drop is exposed to a high-energy eddy, the deformation process proceeds rapidly. The deformed drop offers very little resistance to the eddies surrounding it, and it is drawn out, coiled and finally broken up into smaller droplets of various sizes.",

Their performance was compared based on a thermal sterilisation problem and a food freezing problem. The vertex method proved to be by far the fastest method but is only effective if the solution is a monotonic function of the uncertain parameters. The RSM was also fast albeit much less than the vertex method. Both SQP and SSm were considerably slower than the former methods; SQP did not converge to the real solution in the food freezing test problem. The interval finite element method was used as a building block for a fuzzy finite element analysis based on the \u03b1-cuts method. The RSM fuzzy finite element method was identified as the fastest algorithm among all the tested methods. It was shown that uncertain parameters may cause large uncertainties in the process variables. The algorithms can be used to obtain more realistic modelling of food processes that often have significant uncertainty in the model parameters.",

The pressing was used as a standard method for juice extraction. Experiments were carried out at a constant pressure (P\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0bar) using a laboratory press cell. Two different methods for PEF application at 400\u00a0V/cm were investigated (PEF treatment of whole samples before cutting and PEF treatment of apple slices after cutting). PEF treatment resulted in increase of the juice yield from 44\u00a0g/100\u00a0g apple (untreated samples) to 58\u00a0g/100\u00a0g apple (treatment of whole apples) and 64\u00a0g/100\u00a0g apple (treatment of slices) after 30\u00a0min of pressing. The analysis of pH and conductivity showed no significant difference between untreated and PEF-treated samples. However, the total soluble matter content of juice increased after PEF treatment. The obtained turbidity and transmittance data evidence a noticeable improvement of juice clarity for PEF-treated samples. The PEF pre-treatment was accompanied by an increase of the content of polyphenols and intensification of the antioxidant capacities of juice. Most of these effects (juice clarity and content of antioxidants) were more pronounced for the whole treated apples as compared to untreated apples and PEF-treated apple slices. The evolution of apple browning before and after PEF treatment was more pronounced for whole samples. PEF treatment accelerates browning. The obtained data can contribute to the determination of an optimum time for PEF application. The results evidence that PEF-enhanced expression is promising for production of higher quality juices. PEF treatment of whole apples reduces the energy consumption and is advantageous for industrial applications as compared to the treatment of apple slices. PEF combined with pressing can become a good alternative to traditional process.",

Non-destructive spectroscopy has been introduced in practice and may be utilized as a tool to assess the fruit pigments in the supply chain processes. From the fruit spectrum in the visible (Vis) wavelength range, the pigment contents are analyzed separately at their specific absorbance wavelengths.A drawback of the method is the need for re-calibration due to varying optical properties of the fruit tissue. In order to correct for the scattering differences, most often the spectral intensity in the visible spectrum is normalized by wavelengths in the near infrared (NIR) range, or pre-processing methods are applied in multivariate calibrations.In the present study, the influence of the fruit scattering properties on the Vis/NIR fruit spectrum were corrected by the effective pathlength in the fruit tissue obtained from time-resolved readings of the distribution of time-of-flight (DTOF). Pigment analysis was carried out according to Lambert\u2013Beer law, considering fruit spectral intensities, effective pathlength, and refractive index. Results were compared to commonly applied linear color and multivariate partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis. The approaches were validated on fruits at different ripeness stages, providing variation in the scattering coefficient and refractive index exceeding the calibration sample set.In the validation, the measuring uncertainty of non-destructively analyzing fruits with Vis/NIR spectra by means of PLS or Lambert\u2013Beer in comparison with combined application of Vis/NIR spectroscopy and DTOF measurements showed a dramatic bias reduction as well as enhanced coefficients of determination when using both, the spectral intensities and apparent information on the scattering influence by means of DTOF readings.

Addition of nanocellulose to the neat sodium caseinate films produced an initial increase in the barrier properties to water vapor, and then, it decreases as filler content increased. This was explained in terms of additional detrimental changes (cracks and bubble formation) induced in the morphological structure of the film by the reinforcement.The tensile modulus and strength of composite films increased significantly with increasing cellulose concentrations, while the values of elongation decreased. In the same way it was found that the storage modulus increases considerably with filler addition in the low temperature range (<60\u00a0\u00b0C), though the effect of temperature on the films performance is even more dramatic, as expected in protein-based materials.",

     "abstract": "Pulsed light (PL) is a technology that uses short, high-energy pulses of UV-rich broad spectrum light to inactivate a range of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in foods and on food contact surfaces. Microbial inactivation is directly related to the energy dose (fluence) received by the target microbes. Since fluence decays away from the lamp source due to light absorption and scattering phenomena, it is necessary to accurately quantify the fluence received locally within a substrate in order to design uniform antimicrobial PL treatments. The main objective of this work was to quantify and map the spatial distribution of both total and UV fluence both in air and in liquid substrates with different optical properties. Butterfield\u2019s phosphate buffer (BPB), trypticase soy broth (TSB), and apple juice (clarified apple cider) were used as substrates and Listeria innocua was used as the challenge microorganism. A pyroelectric head, and a UV\u2013VIS\u2013NIR spectrophotometer connected to a 1000\u00a0\u03bcm optical fiber, were used to measure the fluence in air and the three liquid substrates. Fluence was measured at incremental distances from the lamp, along the x-, y- and z-axes. As expected, fluence decreased with increasing distance from the lamp, in all three directions. A 3-parameter Gaussian model described well the spatial distribution of fluence, both in air and in the liquid substrates. Overall, this study emphasizes the fact that substrate\u2013light interactions affect the spatial distribution of fluence within a substrate, and these non-uniformities need to be taken into account when developing commercial applications of PL.",

     "abstract": "Moisture content in foods affects many aspects of processing and storage, as well as quality and pathological activity. Understanding its behavior is very important in the food industry for designing effective long-term food management strategies, in particular transportation and storage. Most approaches found in the literature dealing with moisture in foods consist of measuring it as a function of relative humidity and temperature and then fitting the data to empirical or semi-empirical models for interpolation or correlation purposes. Most semi-empirical models are modifications of early gas adsorption models on hard surfaces, which fundamentally are not well suited to describe water in softer materials such as foods. In this work, we propose and use a more general framework based on equilibrium molecular thermodynamics to model and correlate equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in foods that takes into account other non-adsorption phenomena such as mixing and swelling of the biopolymers in foods. The framework is general, and the current model shows very good results correlating and modeling EMC. The model parameters provide insight into the nature of the water activity in food products, providing potentially useful information for food processing and modeling.",

The method relies on a dispersion system designed to scatter particles on a transparent glass slide. A digital image acquisition system based on specialized software was then used to analyze the acquired images. Particles (1000) were analyzed with respect to four shape factors (circularity, elongation, convexity, and compactness). Dispersion of experimental values characterizes the large heterogeneity in wheat flour particles\u2019 shapes. The results demonstrate that small particles of wheat powders have more regular shape than big ones, due to possible erosion mechanisms occurred during milling.",

Mango fruit dehydration can be easily simulated with implementation of the present advanced analytical technique at different operating conditions. Moreover, the temperature and moisture history of mango slice are presented for varying values of the drying air factors counting temperature, velocity, relative humidity and initial food temperature. This work confirms that notable time can be saved without sacrificing accuracy by applying proposed model. This method is expected to be useful for fast and accurate drying simulation.

The total time of PEF treatment was tPEF\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0ms. The effects of the main extraction parameters (temperature of extracting water and draft) on the extraction kinetics, as well as on the juice and cossette (pulp) characteristics, were investigated. The temperature of extraction from PEF-treated cossettes was varied from 30 to 70\u00a0\u00b0C; the draft was varied from 120 to 90%. The principal possibility of cold (at 30\u00a0\u00b0C) and moderate thermal (50\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C) extraction of sucrose from sugar beet cossettes treated by PEF was confirmed on the pilot countercurrent extractor. The purity of the juice obtained by cold and moderate thermal extraction was not lower than the purity of juice obtained by conventional hot water diffusion at 70\u00a0\u00b0C. The sugar beet pulp can be well exhausted by cold or mild thermal extraction of cossettes treated by PEF. Decrease of draft to 100\u201390% permitted increasing of the extracted juice concentration, but the cossettes were worse exhausted.

     "abstract": "The cashew crop is an important agro-economic activity in many equatorial areas, although less than 10% of the cashew apple production is exploited industrially. This work focuses on two aspects: obtaining food-grade syrups from cashew apple juice and studying fixed bed adsorption dynamics to separate fructose from glucose. Syrups obtained by concentrating clarified cashew apple juice under vacuum showed similar characteristics to a reference food-grade syrup, with a higher content in fructose, which may contribute to a higher sweetening power with less caloric intake. Adsorption equilibrium studies were performed with synthetic solutions of fructose and glucose by frontal analysis under the concentration range found in the syrups (10\u2013120\u00a0g/L) at 30, 40 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C, using the cation exchange resin Dowex MTO 99Ca. Fructose was more strongly adsorbed than glucose, with measured selectivities ranging from 1.50 to 2.25. Resistance to mass transfer was significant and thought to be due to resin crosslinkage. Glucose and fructose breakthrough curves using cashew apple syrup as feed were practically identical to those measured with synthetic solutions, which leads us to believe that high-fructose syrups may be readily obtained by using current continuous chromatographic units, such as SMB.",

     "abstract": "The instantaneous controlled pressure drop (DIC) treatment is used for creation of a porous structure during drying of fruits and vegetables. DIC is based on high temperature, short time heating followed by an abrupt pressure drop into a vacuum. This abrupt pressure drop provokes auto-vaporization of the superheated liquid, expansion and breaking of the cell walls and instantaneous cooling. This process step is inserted between two drying stages at a moisture content of about 20% wet basis. The use of microwave radiation would provide more rapid and homogeneous heating than using steam in the DIC treatment and hot air during the final stage of drying. For that purpose the dielectric properties of the raw and DIC treated products were measured. The measurements were carried out with an open-ended coaxial probe at a frequency of 915\u00a0MHz in the range of temperatures 20\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C and moisture content 5\u201380% w.b. Three regions were revealed for the dependences of the dielectric constant and loss factor on moisture content. At low moisture content, these properties increased linearly with moisture content. At the middle moisture content, the increase was also linear but much steeper. At high moisture content, the dielectric properties were constant. The limits of these regions were different for \u03b5\u2032 and \u03b5\u2033 as well as for the products. The dielectric properties were slightly temperature dependent. The penetration depth increased with decreasing moisture content. The DIC treated products exhibited slightly lower dielectric properties than the raw products.",

Interpretation of changes in the values of the storage modulus (G\u2032) and loss modulus (G\u2033) and the tangent of the phase angle (tan \u03b4) in the function of oscillation frequency (f) was performed on the basis of proposed 3-parameter non-linear regression models.

Increase in the share of the fibre-rich additions caused the G\u2032(f) and G\u2033(f) curves to shift towards higher values, and steeper slope and stronger bending of the shapes of the curves, while the tan \u03b4(f) curve tended to shift towards lower values. The application of carob fibre and oat wholemeal at rates of 2% and 10%, respectively, caused that the ratio of viscous to elastic properties of wheat flour dough was the least dependent on the shear rate (f).

     "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to model the kinetics of adsorption of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) in apple fruit and non-target solid materials found in apple storage rooms. The process was described by Fick\u2019s second law of diffusion of the gas through the pores of the material coupled with adsorption kinetics of the gas on the material\u2019s binding sites. A finite element formulation of the model, describing the diffusion and adsorption mechanisms separately, was first developed. The values of the relevant parameters were estimated based on headspace measurements of the decrease of 1-MCP in jars containing the different materials. The headspace concentration of 1-MCP was measured using gas chromatography. Apple fruit (Golden Delicious and Jonagold) and the following bin construction materials were investigated: high density polyethylene (HDPE), oak, poplar wood and card lining. The range in the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient, adsorption coefficient, and concentration of active sites in the various solids was 10,000-, 8-, and 30-fold, respectively.",

In this study we examined the effect of shear, created by the tangential liquid flow in a rotating disk system (RDS) on adhesion and biofilm formation of Candida krusei.C. krusei biofilms were formed on stainless steel (AISI 304 2B food grade) while being exposed to different shear stresses (from 0 to 91\u00a0N\u00a0m\u22122) generated by two rotational speeds (350 and 800\u00a0rpm). The coupons were examined by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) at 24-h interval for 4\u00a0days.The morphology of the biofilms and the disposition of C. krusei cells in laminar and transitional flow were markedly different. The morphology of biofilm features in the transitional flow revealed the influence of hydrodynamic drag.The early stage of biofilm development resulted practically unaffected by shear stress. However, in a mature biofilm, shear stress determined the disposition of biofilm cells onto the surface. Microcolonies began to appear approximately at 48\u00a0h, at all tested shear stresses, and biofilm formation continued throughout the entire experimental period. Moreover, shape of biofilms was probably governed by the continuous applied shear stress. Finally, biofilms formed under higher shear stress differs significantly in their arrangement, as compared with those formed under lower shear conditions.",

Experimental data demonstrate that higher overrun can be achieved at lower rotation speed, residence time and energy consumption with RS for Newtonian media, but at the expense of larger bubble sizes than with CF. Conversely, CF is more efficient for achieving high overrun and smaller bubbles when highly shear-thinning media are involved, although energy consumption remains higher. However, for both designs, the average bubble size has been related to an invariant dimensionless parameter, the laminar Weber number. Finally, the key role of the local distribution of shear has been highlighted, even at identical average shear rate in both devices.",

As controls, grape samples were also stored without packaging. During a prolonged storage period at refrigerated temperature (5\u00a0\u00b0C) the headspace gas concentrations, the mass loss, the microbiological stability and the sensory acceptability were monitored. Results obtained highlight that all selected packaging films significantly prevent product decay, thus promoting a substantial shelf life prolongation, if compared to the unpackaged product. In particular, the best results were recorded with the thickest polymeric matrix sealed in air, that assured a shelf life more than 70\u00a0days. The active MAPs were not found significant for a shelf life prolongation, due to the fast equilibrium of gas reached in the bags and due to a more pronounced product dehydration.",

The estimated parameters were then employed to simulate three-layered food products (consisting of two different materials) in two kinds of compressive operations.

Fresh beef rump steaks were purchased from a commercial plant, and left to spoil in refrigerator at 8\u00a0\u00b0C. Every 12\u00a0h, hyperspectral scattering profiles over the spectral region between 400 and 1100\u00a0nm were collected directly from the sample surface in reflection pattern in order to develop an optimal model for prediction of the beef spoilage, in parallel the total viable count (TVC) per gram of beef were obtained by classical microbiological plating methods. The spectral scattering profiles at individual wavelengths were fitted accurately by a two-parameter Lorentzian distribution function. TVC prediction models were developed, using multi-linear regression, on relating individual Lorentzian parameters and their combinations at different wavelengths to log10(TVC) value. The best predictions were obtained with r2\u00a0=\u00a00.95 and SEP\u00a0=\u00a00.30 for log10(TVC).

The obtained dried product was rehydrated, and the dispersibility of the nanocapsules was investigated. It was found that the prepared freeze-dried food had different dispersion characteristics at different positions in the dried bulk sample, and this heterogeneity was dependent on the cooling program used during the processing. A model mathematical calculation was carried out in order to obtain the thermal profiles of the sample during freezing. The freezing front velocity and the viscosity of the solution at/around the freezing front were estimated by using the simulated thermal profiles. The dispersibility of the prepared dry food was found to correlate with these values. This suggested that the gel network formation of NC\u2013gelatin would be advantageous for producing excellent NC dispersion characteristics after drying. A slow cooling condition is favourable for promoting sol\u2013gel transition in the solution. However, the large scale of ices formed during slow freezing would damage the gel networks, leading to poor dispersibility.

By linking Lean Attributes (LAs) and Lean Enablers (LEs), this study used Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to identify viable LEs to be practically implemented in order to increase the leanness of the food chain. Furthermore, fuzzy logic is used to deal with linguistic judgments expressing relationships and correlations required in QFD. To illustrate the practical implications of the methodology, the approach is exemplified with the help of a case study in the canning industry.",

Some physical\u2013chemical parameters were measured in fresh, treated and reposed (24\u00a0h at 30\u00a0\u00b0C) samples. The results allow identifying three differentiated steps in the osmotic operation process. At the beginning of the treatment, the cells were turgid and the wall-membrane system stored high level of mechanical energy. In this step, the highest velocity of shrinkage occurred. In the second step, the main driving force was diffusional, with important concentration profiles in the tissue; in this step, the deformation of the tissue reached the maximum shrinkage level of approximately 60%. It produces an important structural change in the tissue removing the concentration profiles and changing the mechanism driving forces. Last step shows internal relaxation of the tissue, increasing the mechanical transport behaviours.",

The properties were evaluated at seven levels of moisture from 2.0% to 20.1% (dry basis) for three selected sunflower hybrids. For both black-hull oilseed hybrid and confectionary hybrid, the variation in moisture content showed a statistically significant effect on dehulling ability, percentage of fines (broken grains with a diameter smaller than 2\u00a0mm) and all the physical properties studied (size, true density, bulk density, porosity, volume and weight, volumetric expansion coefficient, equivalent diameter and sphericity), except seed length in the confectionary hybrid and seed length and thickness in the black-hull oilseed hybrid. For the striped-hull oilseed hybrid, moisture content showed a significant effect only on dehulling ability, percentage of fines, seed width and thickness, bulk density and porosity. Of the oilseed hybrids, the striped hull genotype (higher hull content and both lower oil content and seed size) presented a higher dehulling ability. Nevertheless, the black hull hybrid resulted more sensitive to seed moisture changes. Although the confectionary hybrid showed a higher seed size, hull thickness and hull content, and lower oil content than the oilseed hybrids, the dehulling ability resulted fairly similar in the striped hull sunflower hybrids. The results suggest that sunflower seeds with different structural characteristics need to be conditioned with different moisture content before being subjected to the dehulling process.",

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed using the Statgraphics Plus to evaluate experimental data.

The shrimp waste (freeze-dried heads, shells and tails) was found to have high protein (49% d.w.) and ash (27% d.w.) contents, but a low lipid content (4.9% d.w.) although the latter was higher than those found in other kinds of shrimp captured in Brazil. The fatty acid compositions showed that the lipids had a high content of unsaturated fatty acids, mainly EPA (C20:5; n-3) and DHA (C22:6; n-3). In order to establish an efficient and environmentally friendly recovery process for the astaxanthin (principal carotenoid and antioxidant present in the waste), the following processes were examined: traditional solvent extraction (TSE), super-critical fluid extraction (SC-CO2) and super-critical fluid extraction with co-solvent (SC-CO2\u00a0+\u00a0ethanol). The temperature and pressure conditions for all the SC-CO2 extractions were 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 30.0\u00a0MPa. The results showed that the mixture of 60% (v/v) n-hexane:isopropyl alcohol gave the highest (53\u00a0mg/kg waste) carotenoid extraction yield as compared to acetone, SC-CO2 and SC-CO2\u00a0+\u00a0ethanol. The SC-CO2 showed the lowest extraction yield of astaxanthin, but the addition of the entrainer (10% w/w) produced an important effect, increasing the astaxanthin extraction to values of 57.9%, similar to extraction with acetone (63.3%).",

     "abstract": "Corn flour was produced using the traditional nixtamalization process and different steeping times of 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 13, and 24\u00a0h. The flour particle size distribution was then evaluated in terms of the particles retained by using a 40 US mesh screen. The lime content, the Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) profiles, maximum peak viscosity, breakdown and final viscosity (V) were measured as a function of the steeping time. It was found that the initial rate of increase in viscosity (dV/dt), maximum peak viscosity, breakdown and final viscosity of fractions depended on the amount of calcium incorporated in the corn kernels during the steeping time (Ts) of the nixtamalization process. The particles retained using a 40 mesh that were steeped for 0\u20135\u00a0h, do not have the characteristic points of an RVA profile, i.e., maximum peak viscosity and breakdown. However, the particles retained using a 40 mesh and steeped for 6\u201324\u00a0h developed peak viscosity, breakdown and final viscosity. The corn flours that are recommended for making tortillas are precisely the flours whose particle size distributions develop these three characteristic points in the RVA profile. Differences in RVA measurements of the size fractions can be explained on the basis of the calcium content of the course fractions of corn flours. It was concluded that RVA characteristics may be changed by the calcium content in the starch polymer structures created during the nixtamalization process. Consequently, the increased calcium content in starch particles should be reflected in RVA measurements as an increase in the peak viscosity, in the gelatinization rate and in the development of a noticeable breakdown.",

However, quality control in tortilla production is still performed by human operators which may lead to misclassification due to their subjectivity and fatigue. In order to reduce the need for human operators and therefore misclassification, we developed a computer vision framework to automatically classify the quality of corn tortillas according to five hedonic sub-classes given by a sensorial panel. The proposed framework analyzed 750 corn tortillas obtained from 15 different Mexican commercial stores which were either small, medium or large in size. More than 2300 geometric and color features were extracted from 1500 images capturing both sides of the 750 tortillas. After implementing a feature selection algorithm, in which the most relevant features were selected for the classification of the five sub-classes, only 64 features were required to design a classifier based on support vector machines. Cross-validation yielded a performance of 95% in the classification of the five hedonic sub-classes. Additionally, using only 10 of the selected features and a simple statistical classifier, it was possible to determine the origin of the tortillas with a performance of 96%. We believe that the proposed framework opens up new possibilities in the field of automated visual inspection of tortillas.",

Microscopy and light scattering show that simple shear flow of a phase-separating gelatin\u2013dextran mixture gave smaller particles with a narrower size distribution. Upon gelation due to a temperature decrease, the viscosity of the gelatin increased, which altered the coalescence and break-up behaviour of the particles formed. The small particles obtained by a high shear during processing aggregated into larger particle clusters, once particle solidified upon gelation. The particle size can be predicted using correlation with droplet break-up and coalescence considering the properties before gelation. The sizes of the clusters can be predicted with the coalescence behaviour using the properties after gelation. Clusters originating from small particles resist more deformation, resulting in pronounced rheological effects (e.g. increase viscosity, increased strain softening point).",

     "abstract": "The desalination of fish meat extract was performed via electrodialysis based on different membrane stack configurations (i.e., conventional electrodialysis or packed-bed electrodialysis) at a constant current. The salt removal and brix change showed that the diluted fish meat extract could be effectively desalted using electrodialysis, while the mostly nutritional ingredients remained in the dilution. Compared with the conventional electrodialysis (ED), a lower membrane stack potential meant lower energy consumption and higher current efficiency for the same salt removal in the packed-bed electrodialysis (PBED). The results indicated that the PBED might be more suitable for use in the fish meat extract desalination due to the effects of ion exchange resins in enhancing ion electromigration and mitigating membrane fouling.",

The SYC yogurt exhibited a more compact casein micelle aggregates network than that of the SYYSF yogurt which was more open, relaxed and covered with fibrous structures attributed to the YSF components. The rheological analysis showed that the SYYSF yogurt had lower storage modulus (G\u2032) and loss modulus (G\u2033) values in the linear viscoelastic region than the SYC yogurt, but its flow behavior was characterized by a lower flow index (n), higher consistency index (k), and higher yield stress (\u03c40) than the SYC yogurt.

The Herschel\u2013Bulkley model was employed to characterize flow behavior of BSG solutions at 0.1\u20131000\u00a0s\u22121 shear rate. The pseudoplasticity of BSG increased markedly with concentration. Flow behavior of 1% BSG indicated a higher viscosity of this gum at low shear rates compared to xanthan, konjac and guar gum at similar concentration. The activation energy of BSG quantified using an Arrhenius equation increased from 4.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 to 8.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0J\u00a0mol\u22121 as concentration changed from 0.5% to 2%\u00a0wt/wt.

Next, absorbance images of areas containing foreign materials and blueberries were acquired by NIR spectral imaging at these two wavelengths. Nine thousand eight hundred and fifty pixels of a blueberry area and 10,107 pixels of a foreign material area were picked randomly from the absorbance images. Discriminant analysis was applied to the absorbance of pixels within the area of interest to determine the discriminant function and threshold value for image binarization. Finally, binary images were obtained by applying the discriminant function and threshold value to each pixel of the absorbance images taken at 1268 and 1317\u00a0nm.

The mapping of thermal conditions indicated satisfactory thermal homogeneity, with average temperature variations of 5\u00a0\u00b0C and maximum relative variations of the convective heat transfer coefficient of 15% on the thermal domain investigated. Internal heat and mass transfers, the extent of thermal reactions within the sponge cake and repeatability of the baking operation were all characterized by experimental measurements. Some of the main operating variables were monitored in the cake (core and surface temperatures, moisture content, levels of chemical reactants and products) and others in the baking atmosphere (temperature, humidity and concentrations of volatile compounds). Specific non-disruptive sampling devices were designed to extract data from cakes and the oven atmosphere in order to follow the kinetics of thermal reactions during the baking operation. Three phases could be identified during baking, corresponding to the relative importance of conductive and evaporative internal heat transfer regimes and to macroscopic changes in the cake structure with formation of a crust. The progress of thermal reactions was monitored with satisfactory precision in both the cake and the baking vapors: relative standard deviations of 2% and 8.7% were obtained respectively for the water content and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content of three replicates during a baking operation.",

Almonds were roasted at 130, 140 and 150\u00a0\u00b0C with three different methods: IR roasting, sequential infrared and hot air (SIRHA) roasting, and traditional hot air (HA) roasting. The heating rate and pasteurization efficacy of almonds under different roasting methods and temperatures were evaluated. Pediococcus sp. NRRL B-2354 was used as a surrogate for Salmonella enterica Enteriditis PT 30 for evaluating the pasteurization efficacy of different processing methods and conditions. When SIRHA roasting at 130, 140 and 150\u00a0\u00b0C roasting temperatures was used to produce medium roasted almonds, 4.10-, 5.82- and 6.96-log, bacterial reductions were achieved with 38%, 39% and 62% time saving compared to HA roasting at each temperatures, respectively. The decimal reduction time of the bacteria at all roasting temperatures were calculated for SIRHA roasting as 8.68, 3.72 and 1.42\u00a0min, respectively, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.92 and the thermal resistance constant was found as 25.4\u00a0\u00b0C. The total color change followed zero-order reaction kinetics and the activation energies were 73.58, 52.15 and 67.60\u00a0kJ/mol for HA, IR and SIRHA roasting, respectively.

An increase in elastic (G\u2032) and viscous (G\u2033) moduli at T\u00a0<\u00a050\u00a0\u00b0C, reflecting protein aggregation, and a strong decrease at T\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0\u00b0C, reflecting structural damage, were observed in thermal gelation profiles of low-quality squid surimi. The contribution of 1% KAD (10%) to enhancement of gelation ability was assessed by evaluating the viscoelastic properties of the gels, with and without KAD, at increasing alkalinity levels. Gels with KAD at high-pH had the best rheological properties. Small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) tests showed a significant decrease in rigidity, an increase in strain amplitude and a decrease in the frequency-dependence of G\u2032 and G\u2033. These results were in agreement with instrumental texture analyses, meaning that KAD may be used to overcome the negative effect of the poor protein functionality of low-quality squid surimi and achieve better gels from them.",

For this purpose, the water activity of the solutions was modulated using both a ionic (sodium chloride) and a non-ionic (sorbitol) ligand and viscosity changed upon the addition of maltodextrin.In viscous solutions characterized by different compositions, the effectiveness of a solute in the inhibition of the HRP activity was dependent both on the chemical properties of the solution, as described by aw, and on the mobility of the system, as described by the inverse of viscosity and T\u00a0\u2212 T g \u2032 . Viscosity was the most important factor in the inhibition of HRP activity in solutions characterized by the same T g \u2032 value, but when T g \u2032 was changed, due to changes in the solutes composition, the latter became a key factor in the regulation of the enzyme activity.In salt\u2013maltodextrin systems the water activity reduction limited HRP activity with higher efficiency at low viscosities whilst in sorbitol\u2013maltodextrin systems, characterised by different T g \u2032 values, the aw lowering by sorbitol addition resulted in the increase of HRP activity depending on its effect on T g \u2032 .",

     "abstract": "The influence of ripening degree of drupes during the harvesting period is well established in olive oil sector. A range of methods for expressing the stage of maturity of olives have been proposed in scientific literature. One of the most commonly adopted methods provides the evaluation of a Ripening Index (RI) on the basis of olive skin and pulp colour. Unfortunately, the RI evaluation technique is time-consuming, subjective (depending on expert skill) and depends on environmental conditions that may affect colour appearance of olives. This work describes a novel method for rapid, automatic and objective prediction of the Ripening Index of an olive lot. The method integrates a Machine Vision system, capable of performing a colour-based raw prediction of RI, with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based algorithm to refine it. Such a refinement is based on a set of chemical parameters (oil content, sugar content and phenol content) which are provided as input to the ANN and which can be obtained by historical curves for the region where the RI needs to be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

     "abstract": "NIR spectroscopy was used as a non-destructive technique for the assessment of changes in certain internal quality properties of wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) during on-vine ripening and at harvest. A total of 108 different wine grape samples were used to construct calibration models based on reference data and NIR spectral data, obtained using a commercially-available diode-array spectrophotometer (380\u20131700\u00a0nm). The feasibility of testing bunches of intact grapes was investigated and compared with more traditional methods of presentation, such as berries or must. Predictive models were constructed to quantify changes in soluble solid content (SSC, \u00b0Brix), reducing-sugar content (g/l), pH-value, titrable acidity (g/l tartaric acid), tartaric acid (g/l) and malic acid (g/l), these being the major parameters used to chart ripening. NIRS technology provided good precision for the bunch analysis mode assayed for SSC (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.89; SECV\u00a0=\u00a01.41\u00a0\u00b0Brix), for reducing-sugar content (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.87; SECV\u00a0=\u00a017.13\u00a0g/l) and for pH-value (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.69; SECV\u00a0=\u00a00.19). Models developed for testing other fruit acidity parameters yielded results sufficient to provide a screening tool to distinguish between low and high acidity values in intact grapes. Significantly, the results obtained with bunch presentation were similar to those obtained with berries and must, thus justifying further implementation of NIRS technology for the non-destructive analysis of quality properties both during on-vine ripening and on arrival at the winery. This method allows musts to be processed separately depending on initial grape quality, assessed with a single spectrum measurement and in a matter of seconds.",

Two product categories were studied, using formulations based either on potato flakes or wheat gluten. Products were deep-fat fried at 170\u00a0\u00b0C and two oil fractions, penetrated oil and surface oil, were determined at the beginning and at the end of cooling period. The surface of fried products was measured using a scanning laser microscope and characterized by an area-scale fractal analysis. Within each product category, products with higher surface roughness retained more oil. However, this relationship could not be extended when comparing products of different categories. Potato-flake-based products were rougher than gluten-based products, but retained less oil. Further, gluten-based products absorbed most of the oil during frying, whereas potato-flake-based mostly absorbed oil during cooling. Certainly, surface roughness is a key factor in oil absorption, but other food-related properties, such as the micro-structure of the crust, may explain differences among product categories and should be examined in future studies.",

However, since the accuracy of predictive models has been affected by the dry level of the sample, in this study, prediction models for salt and water contents and also for aw to be applied during drying process were developed. Results showed that the number of independent variables needed to obtain regression models with a similar accuracy to the models previously developed is higher in drier samples. Furthermore, an important effect of fat content is also observed since prediction of aw, salt content and water content were significantly improved when the fattiest samples were removed from the calibration or when fat content was included in the predictive models. Because of the different physicochemical characteristics of muscles, models developed specifically for Semimembranosus (SM), Biceps femoris (BF) or Semitendinosus (ST) muscles were more accurate. It can be concluded that models for prediction during the drying process were accurate enough to consider CT as a useful tool applicable for controlling and optimizing the dry-cured ham elaboration processes.",

WT proved more effective than PCA, as a means for variables selection. Best classification models were achieved with LS-SVM. A total accuracy of 95.1% and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.952 for test set were obtained by LS-SVM. The results showed that WT-LS-SVM can be as a rapid screening technique for detection of this type of honey adulteration with good accuracy and better generalization.",

However, only salt incorporation augmented water holding capacity (WHC).A synergistic effect was detected between MTGase and salt for several important textural properties, particularly, gel strength, which reached 64.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1\u00a0N\u00a0mm, a value comparable to those of best quality surimi. Moreover, MTGase required addition of salt to the product for its effect to be felt, however only a minimal amount (0.25%, w/w wp) sufficed. In fact, the addition of MTGase enabled reduction in salt content to 1.0% (w/w wp), without significant loss of textural and overall quality.",

First of all, the value degeneration process is described, using several mathematical models for handing different ways of perishing. Based on the mathematical models, and data from RFID and the sensor network, the quality of the goods can be predicted by the forecast module. When something abnormal occurs, the warning function will send an alarm signal to the users, then, the rule-based decision module will provide the user with suggestions as how to cope with the abnormality.

This work was designed to compare the difference in mass transfer of water and salt in water-boiled salted duck among different concentration brines during wet-curing. Duck breasts were wet-cured for 72\u00a0h in four brine solutions having concentrations, i.e. 5%, 15%, and 25% NaCl (w/w), and repeatedly reused supersaturated brine (\u2a7e25% NaCl (w/w)) which is often used in commercial production in China. Results showed that as brine concentration increased, the weight gain and water content decreased and the NaCl content of meat samples increased. Moreover, hardness and springiness increased with increasing brine concentration coupled with a drop in water holding capacity (WHC). Higher salt concentration brines showed a higher proteolysis than lower salt concentration brines. Therefore, 15% NaCl (w/w) brine, the solution having moderate salt concentration, was the most suitable for wet-curing just because of its higher process yields, effective diffusivity value, De, and lower health risks.",

A numerical method of finite differences allowed for the calculation of the effective diffusion coefficients as a function of concentration, using the material coordinates to consider tissue shrinkage. The coefficients were obtained by simultaneously integrating the three differential equations (for water, sucrose and salt). The behavior of the apple cellular tissue was also studied using light microscopy techniques to obtain images of the osmotically treated pieces.",

Due to well known limitations of hot air (HA) drying, a new technique of using far-infrared radiation (FIR) in combination with hot air and heat pump (HP) dryers for longan is proposed in this study. Longan with initial moisture content of approximately 84\u201386% w.b. was dried to about 18% w.b. at the drying temperature of 55\u00a0\u00b0C in the case of combined FIR-heat pump drying and 65\u00a0\u00b0C in the case of combined FIR-hot air drying with 80% recycled air. In both cases, the electric power supplied to FIR rods was set at 250, 350 and 450\u00a0W. The experimental results are presented in terms of the drying kinetics, dried product qualities (color, shrinkage, percentage of rehydration, water activity, texture, and microstructure) and sensory characteristics of the dried product. The results show that FIR in combination with hot air and heat pump drying increases the drying rate of longan by reducing the drying time. FIR also helps to create more porous structure in dried longan, with porosity increasing with the power supplied to the FIR heaters. The formation of porous structure results in a product with lower shrinkage, improved rehydration, lower hardness and lower toughness than samples dried in the absence of FIR. In addition, the FIR dried longan had a stronger red color and appeared darker. Dried longans obtained by HP, HA, combined techniques and the product from the local market, were all rated similarly by a sensory panel for color, shape, flavor and taste. It is worth noting that the overall energy used for FIR-assisted drying processes decreased with the increase in the power supplied to the FIR heaters.",

To ensure CO2 hydrate formation it is important to avoid ice formation because ice to CO2 hydrate conversion proceeds too slowly to occur during flash freezing.

These systems mimic the human sense to provide a decision on final food quality and safety. Nanotechnology techniques and biosensors are the recent advances in these systems. Odor and taste sensors are interestingly under consideration to food engineers and scientist for application in food processing tasks such as drying, packaging, sorting and so on. Soft computing together with computer development is the promising outlook to enhance the performance of these sensing systems to food quality and safety characterization.

Similar behavior was also found for sensory evaluated structural and textural characteristics. The examination of macrostructure confirmed the effects of extrusion conditions and feed composition on structural and textural properties.

Considerable emulsion droplet flocculation occurred around iso-electric point of both proteins: FPC (pH 4.2) and SPC (pH 4.5). FPC and SPC-stabilized emulsions remained relatively stable against droplet aggregation and creaming at NaCl concentration below 100 and 50\u00a0mM, respectively. The emulsions stabilized by both proteins were fairly stable within these thermal processing regimes. FPC appears to be less effective as an emulsifier compared to SPC due to its lower emulsion viscosity. Hence, FPC could be more effective in emulsions that are fairly viscous.",

The difficulty in controlling and monitoring the temperature history of food products makes it difficult to precisely predict shelf life. Time\u2013temperature indicators (TTIs) provide a visual summary of a product\u2019s accumulated chill-chain history, recording the effects of both time and temperature. Attempts have been made to develop a prototype of a time\u2013temperature indicator based on the diffusion of lactic acid, which is temperature-dependent. Four lactic acid-based TTIs were made in different substrate concentrations. Color changes associated with the diffusion of lactic acid were monitored. In the vapor diffusion of lactic acid, an irreversible color change of a chemical chromatic indicator (from green to red) clearly and progressively occurred due to the pH reduction. The temperature dependence of these TTIs kinetics was characterized isothermally in the range of 4\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C, yielding activation energy (Ea) of, approximately, 50\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121.

The differences between the Ea values of the TTIs and the Ea associated with food quality losses \u2013 including enzymatic loss, hydrolysis, lipid oxidation, nutrient loss and microbial growth \u2013 were less than 40\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121, and therefore these TTIs could be considered as good candidates to monitor food quality losses. Although these TTIs do not cover the whole range of food quality losses, they could be applied to show the time\u2013temperature history of some foods, especially fruits and vegetables, and to indicate food quality associated with time\u2013temperature exposure.",

Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were chosen as the challenge microorganisms. The ILP system was a laboratory-scale four-lamp batch system generating 3\u00a0J/cm2 with an input voltage of 3000\u00a0V. The results obtained demonstrate successful application of ILP treatment for reduction of L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 on a surface of stainless steel slicing knife. The inactivation effectiveness depended on the type of meat product that was in the contact with the treated surface and on the time between the contamination and the ILP treatment. Statistical analysis showed the significant interaction between the time and type of meat product on the effectiveness of ILP treatment. The highest effectiveness of the ILP (the complete inactivation of 6.5 log CFU/side of knife) was obtained when the knife surface was in contact with the products containing lower fat and protein content and when it was treated with pulsed light as fast as possible after the contamination (within 60\u00a0s). The decontamination efficacy of ILP treatment could not be improved by multiple light pulses if lost due to the extended time between the moment of contamination and ILP treatment. Results showed that the suggested approach can be very effective as an intervention strategy along meat processing lines preventing cross-contamination between the equipment and the final product.",

Finally, the product was packaged in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or oriented polypropylene (OPP) pouches, and stored at 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% RH to simulate actual storage conditions and to determine shelf life. This actual shelf life was compared to the predicted shelf life by using empirical models and Ep for WVP. Moisture sorption kinetics was more rapid during the initial stage, while a lesser amount of moisture was adsorbed as adsorption time increased. The higher the relative humidity used, the more pronounced the effect. The sigmoidal moisture sorption isotherms of this product can be classified as type II. The GAB model was found to be the best-fit model for this product. Once the product hardness or work reached the maximum and began to reduce at moisture content (MC) \u22486%, the product texture began to be detected as becoming slightly soft. This implies that hardness and work at the maximum level could be used to identify the critical MC which causes a loss of crispness to an unacceptable degree. The predicted shelf lives \u2013 estimated by employing Ep for WVP of LDPE and OPP, and the GAB model \u2013 were close to the actual shelf lives. Therefore, the estimation by empirical models and activation energy was found to be applicable for rapid and accurate shelf life prediction.",

The use of the non equilibrium approach, allowed the implementation of the model in commercial software. Numerical Finite Element Method (FEM) scheme was used to solve the equations. The model was compared with experimental results reported in literature. Results show a good agreement between experimental and numerical results. Sensitivity analysis of the effect of the evaporation rate constant and process operating conditions on the temperature and moisture content were conducted and showed that the baking process was affected mainly by the convective heat transfer and the product initial moisture characteristics.",

Temperature, moisture content, feed flow rate, atomizing air-flow rate, main air-flow rate and particle size have been varied to estimate the range of crystallinity of lactose obtainable in a pilot-scale spray dryer. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and sorption tests (water-induced crystallization) have been used to assess the degree of crystallinity for freshly spray-dried samples. The degree of crystallinity could be varied from 18% to 72% by varying the operating conditions while allowing reasonable drying of the material. The study suggested that the use of a lower inlet temperature increased the crystallinity of the product from 25% (at 230\u00a0\u00b0C) to 60% (at 170\u00a0\u00b0C). A decrease in product crystallinity was also noted when using a lower atomizing air-flow rate. Statistical analysis with t-tests confirmed these differences to be significant with 95% confidence. The results suggest differences between small and pilot-scale spray dryers due to differences in particle sizes and drying rates.",

Although the origin of the endotherm is still debatable, it has been attributed to the water\u2013hydroxyl group interactions and/or enthalpic associations between water and carbohydrates. In the present study, physical aging of the starch components of corn flakes prepared with two different levels of starch fragmentation was studied using thermal and rheological methods. A sub-Tg endotherm was observed at temperatures around 50\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C by both DSC and Oscillatory Squeezing Flow measurements. An increase of 1.5% of moisture content was observed for both fragmented flakes during aging. The temperatures at which the sub-Tg endotherms occurred were independent of aging and moisture content increase during storage, whilst enthalpy increased with both aging time and moisture content. Although the moisture content of the two types of flakes were different the aging time at which the first endotherm appeared and the rate at which the enthalpy increased were dependent only on the level of starch fragmentation. Corn flakes with a high level of starch fragmentation required a longer period of aging time before the presence of the endotherm could be detected and had a greater rate of increase in enthalpy. Overall, flakes having higher starch fragmentation absorbed more water, and the percent of water uptake decreased with aging time. Flakes with low starch fragmentation exhibited little to no change in water uptake during aging.",

In this study, the aqueous solubilities of 3,3\u2032,4\u2032,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone (quercetin) and its dihydrate were measured at temperatures between 25 and 140\u00a0\u00b0C using a continuous flow type apparatus.

Shorter cooling times were obtained using processes (i) and (ii), where the cooling is performed in non-immersed samples, while smaller weight losses are obtained using process (iii).

Effects of screw speed (230 and 330\u00a0rpm) and SPC level (10%, 20%, 30% and 50%) on expansion and mechanical properties were determined. Compared with 230\u00a0rpm, screw speed at 330\u00a0rpm resulted in increased specific mechanical energy, expansion ratio, water absorption and water solubility indices and decreased bulk density and piece density. Varying screw speeds did not significantly affect the mechanical strength of extrudates or starch molecular weight distribution. Bulk and piece densities, and water absorption index (WAI) only slightly increased or exhibited no significant trends as SPC level increased to 20%. A substantial increase in bulk and piece densities and decrease in expansion ratio and WAI were observed as SPC level increased from 20% to 30%. The trends were either reversed or moderated as SPC increased to 50%. These results in combination with average crushing force and water solubility index data provided a significant insight into the interactions between HACS and SPC during extrusion processing. As compared to an earlier baseline study by our research group on normal corn starch \u2013 SPC extrudates, results from the current study indicated that the expansion of extrudate containing HACS alone was lower than that of extrudates containing normal corn starch. However, expansion of the HACS\u2013SPC blends was not significantly impacted at 10\u201320% SPC levels, whereas the expansion of normal corn starch was significantly reduced.",

Final resin compounding and pelletization was achieved by a twin screw extruder and a pelletizator to permit the homogenization of all resin components prior to film casting.

The experiments clearly demonstrate that the high pressure treatment at room temperature improves the quality of pomegranate juice, increasing the intensity of red color of the fresh juice and preserving the content of natural anthocyanins. The residual activity of some enzymes at the end of high pressure processing, independently on the processing conditions, such as the polyphenoloxidase (PPO), causes the degradation of the nutraceutical compounds as observed in particular processing conditions, thus suggesting that the optimal combination of the processing parameters should take into account the degradation of the anthocyanins as well as the enzymatic activity.",

To develop a rheological model, true rheological properties of dough were measured in compression and extension. A filament stretching device was constructed to obtain consistent data for dough extension. Results showed dough to be a non-linear, rate-dependent material that was capable of undergoing large deformations with only moderate elastic recovery. Freshly mixed dough had additional complexities of anisotropy and Mullins softening. The Bergstrom\u2013Boyce model, which has been known to capture large deformation behaviors of lightly cross-linked elastomers, was modified to include anisotropy and Mullins softening and applied to dough. The sheeting process was modeled in finite element simulations as a plane-strain rolling operation using the commercially available software, Abaqus. The simulation predictions were in good agreement with experimental data for both roll forces and dough thickness. Techniques for controlling dough flow rates utilizing on-line, roll force measurements have been projected. Future studies for delineating sheeting effects on dough structure have been identified.",

The volume flux (Jv), trans-membrane pressure (\u0394P), solute concentrations in feed solution (Cb) and permeate solution (Cp) were collected and the experimental Robs was obtained. On the basis of the extended Nernst\u2013Planck equation and film theory, a theoretical Robs model was established. The model parameters including solute permeability (Ps) and reflection coefficient (\u03c3) for arabinose, xylose and xylobiose were estimated by curving fitting using genetic algorithm (GA) method. It was found that the reflection coefficient (\u03c3) for arabinose (0.895) was higher than that for xylose (0.776), which indicated that the membrane retention to arabinose was stronger. Membrane structural parameters, such as ratio of solute radius to pore radius (\u03bb) and ratio of effective membrane porosity to membrane thickness (Ak/\u0394x), were also estimated using steric-hindrance pore (SHP) model.",

     "abstract": "It is well accepted that high undercooling or supercooling usually produces numerous small ice crystals. This paper shows that if heat transfer is not rapid enough, high undercooling causes non-homogenous sized ice crystals. Three freezing regimes (i.e. fast, slow and slow with undercooling) were used in this study. Fast freezing produced numerous homogeneously small ice crystals embedded in a thin rice starch gel matrix. This microstructure caused low % syneresis and hardness versus slow freezing\u2019s rather homogenous distribution of fewer large ice crystals embedded in a thicker gel matrix resulting in high % syneresis and hardness. However, slow freezing with undercooling produced non-homogenous clusters involving small and large ice crystals embedded in a very thick gel matrix. Starch retrogradation before ice formation played an important role in this frozen structure. The information gained from this study enhances understanding of the behavior of starch-based food during freezing and storage.",

     "abstract": "An image processing based technique was developed to measure volume and mass of citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges, and tangerines. The technique uses two cameras to give perpendicular views of the fruit. An efficient algorithm was designed and implemented in Visual Basic (VB) language. The product volume was calculated by dividing the fruit image into a number of elementary elliptical frustums. The volume is calculated as the sum of the volumes of individual frustums using VB. The volumes computed showed good agreement with the actual volumes determined by water displacement method. The coefficient of determination (R2) for lemon, lime, orange, and tangerine were 0.962, 0.970, 0.985, and 0.959, respectively. The Bland\u2013Altman 95% limits of agreement for comparison of volumes with the two methods were (\u22121.62; 1.74), (\u22127.20; 7.57), (\u22126.54; 6.84), and (\u22124.83; 6.15), respectively. The results indicated citrus fruit\u2019s size has no effect on the accuracy of computed volume. The characterization results for various citrus fruits showed that the volume and mass are highly correlated. Hence, a simple procedure based on computed volume of assumed ellipsoidal shape was also proposed for estimating mass of citrus fruits. This information can be used to design and develop sizing systems.",

The re-extrusion number affected the extensional and shears viscosity of amaranth, oat and quinoa dough samples. The breaking strength of dry non-conventional spaghetti increased with the increase of the re-extrusion number for amaranth and oat. The dough gelatinization degree of the quinoa and oat significantly increased with the re-extrusion, whereas no influence of re-extrusion was found for the amaranth dough.

Specifically, the whole spaghetti sample is envisaged as composite material made of co-axial cylinders each of which with a specific elastic modulus, which is strongly dependent on local water concentration. The Weibull cumulative distribution function is used to describe the changes in the mechanical properties of each co-axial cylinder as related to the corresponding local water concentration. The proposed model has been tested on three semolina pasta samples and three non-conventional pasta samples, which included one whole meal semolina sample and two maize-based samples. The model satisfactorily describes the experimental data in terms of elastic modulus and tensile strength.

Distribution of the electric field strength and temperature within the treatment zone was estimated by a finite element method. A good agreement was observed between the temperatures estimated by numerical simulation and temperatures measured by a thermocouple in the treatment zone before and after the PEF treatments (values of RMSE below 3%). Influence of the treatment temperature on PEF inactivation (30\u00a0kV/cm) of Salmonella typhimurium was investigated at temperatures between 4 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C in media of pH 3.5 and 7.0. Treatment temperature had an important effect on microbial inactivation for both values of pH. At pH 3.5 the inactivation of S. typhimurium was irrelevant at 4\u00a0\u00b0C but about 1.5, 2.9, 4.0 and 5.0 Log10 reductions were obtained after 30 pulses (90\u00a0\u03bcs) at 15, 27, 38 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. At pH 7.0, around two Log10 cycles of inactivation were observed after 50 pulses (150\u00a0\u03bcs) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. At temperatures in the range between 15 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C the treatment temperature practically did not influence PEF resistance of S. typhimurium. A model based on the Weibull distribution adequately described kinetics of inactivation of S. typhimurium at different temperatures.

In particle-tracking, the viscosity is measured on a sub-micron scale, providing contributions of different regions in the sample. Honey viscosity was Newtonian, even in reduced-calorie varieties, and adhered to the Arrhenius equation, viscosity exponentially decreasing with temperature. The Arrhenius activation energy and viscosity were moisture-dependent. Our data are comparable to previously reported honey rheology from different regions in the world. In conclusion, we show that rheology agrees with microrheology, as expected for a Newtonian liquid.

Boomer had the highest amount of water uptake capacity (74.60\u00a0g water/100\u00a0g of seeds) at room temperature (20\u00a0\u00b0C) which can be linked with its pore properties. French-green lentils imbibed the largest amount of water at elevated soaking temperatures (50\u00a0\u00b0C and 85\u00a0\u00b0C) and can be attributed to its higher seed surface area to volume ratio, high protein content and relatively thinner seed coat. Water uptake at elevated temperatures (50\u00a0\u00b0C and 85\u00a0\u00b0C) were predicted by a two parameter Mitscherlich model (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.99, \u03c72\u00a0<\u00a00.5) within 1.36\u20133.07% average absolute error.

     "abstract": "Automated image analysis has emerged as a useful tool for quality evaluation and inspection of food processes and products. Image analysis techniques are aimed to the extraction of features for quantifying texture, shapes and distributions of irregular geometries recasted on a microscopy image. The monitoring of crystal growth evolution in traditional industrial processes commonly relies on the visual expertise of long-term trained operators, which limits seriously the automated operation of the process. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential usefulness of fractal metrics; namely Fourier analysis fractal dimension and lacunarity using images, as quantitative descriptors of crystallization evolution. To our knowledge this is the first reported use of lacunarity for the characterization of images of crystallization images from direct samples of crystallization slurries. Fractal dimension and lacunarity increase with the crystallization time. Increased fractal dimension was related to the formation of large clusters in the image, and was taken as an indicative of the amount of formed crystals. On the other hand, lacunarity is an index of non-uniformity of particles on the image, such that lacunarity can be considered as an indicator of the crystal shape and size diversity. In an overall sense, the results showed that fractal analysis can be incorporated as a complementary tool for monitoring the evolution of cane sugar crystallization process.",

Both tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) of films increased with increasing PVA content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). When PVA was incorporated up to 40%, films prepared at pH 11 had the higher TS than did those prepared at pH 3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, as PVA content was greater than 40%, films prepared at pH 3 exhibited the higher TS than did those prepared at pH 11 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Water vapor permeability (WVP) of the films prepared at pH 3 increased when PVA content increased up to 40% and decreased with further increases in PVA content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). PVA films had the higher TS, EAB and WVP than did FMP films and FMP/PVA blend films prepared at both pHs.

Finite volume method (FVM) was used to calculate the heat transfer phenomena within the heating and cooling devices. The temperature increase during PEF treatment due to ohmic heating was calculated using the total specific energy input. A temperature\u2013time profile of the PEF process depending on different treatment conditions was obtained.Heat inactivation kinetics of native ALP and LPO in raw milk and E. coli in apple juice were determined by glass capillary method. A model for the calculation of inactivation levels based on a first order inactivation kinetic was obtained. A MathCad tool was programmed to perform the mathematical comparison of the thermal exposure of ALP, LPO and E. coli during the PEF process and their thermal stability. The impact of different temperature\u2013time profiles resulting from the variation of the PEF treatment parameters on inactivation and residual activity were investigated. The quantification of thermal and electric field effects and their contribution to the overall inactivation revealed that thermal effects were the major reason for the enzyme inactivation and had large impact on the inactivation of E. coli at elevated temperatures.The model may be used for the optimization of a PEF process to achieve the minimization of thermal inactivation of heat-sensitive components but also for the beneficial use of thermal effects to improve the microbial inactivation.",

To carry out this study it have been employed SPI-based films containing two SPI:LIPID ratios (1:0.25 and 1:0.5), and two types of lipids, oleic acid (OA) and beeswax (BW), in OA:BW ratios 100:0, 70:30, 50:50, 30:70 and 0:100. The measurements were performed by a gas chromatography technique. The films that showed more retention were SPI:LIPID 1:0.5 100% BW and control film. Concerning release rate, films containing BW as unique lipid material gave the lowest aroma release rate. Apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) of all films are in the same order of magnitude (10\u221215\u00a0m2\u00a0s\u22121). Dapp decreases when BW increases in the film matrix and when oleic acid amount decreases.

The proposed algorithm is currently programmed to perform shape analysis to grade oysters into good quality, banana, and irregular grades and can be extended to accommodate other grades acceptable for market. Other shape categories can be added with a simple configuration procedure. The contour of the oyster is extracted and its data points are reduced to 50 points using either curve evolution and fixed interval sub-sampling data reduction methods.

     "abstract": "In the 1950s the concept of water activity was proposed for determining food stability. This concept is now being used although it has some limitations. Indeed, these limitations mean that the concept is not universally applicable and in fact is invalid under certain conditions. In order to address the limitations of the water activity concept, the glass transition concept was proposed in the 1960s, although significant application of the concept only started in the 1980s. Recently, it has become evident that the glass transition concept is also not universally valid for stability determination in all types of foods when stored under different conditions. Currently in the literature the need is emphasized to combine the water activity and glass transition concepts since both concepts could complement each other. The glass transition concept was used to develop the state diagram by drawing another stability map using freezing curve and glass transition line. In this paper an attempt is made to review the published methods used to combine both concepts. These approaches are graphical plot of glass transition conditions and water content as a function of water activity, and macro\u2013micro region concept in the state diagram. In addition, a new approach is proposed in this paper by defining a critical temperature for stability and then relating it with water content, and other hurdles affecting food stability. The water mobility concept is also reviewed to provide another dimension of food stability in order to determine a more complete picture.",

The purpose of this work was to analyse the progress of cell microstructural changes by direct observation and further study of the digital images captured during the treatments. Cell features were identified and measured. Protoplast shrinkage increased as did sucrose concentration; however, the cell wall underwent more deformation at the lowest concentration assayed. High sucrose concentration led to an almost instantaneous protoplast separation since the membrane-to-wall linkers did not resist the stretching of the contracting protoplast; this response frequently resulted in membrane lysis and loss of cellular compartmentation. Cells structure was characterized and was proved to be related to the phenomenon undergone by the cell (shrinkage, complete plasmolysis, or membrane lysis). The response of the cell was found to be a function not only of the osmotic solution concentration but also of initial cell microstructural features. Results also suggested that a better preservation of membrane integrity and membrane-to-wall connections might be achieved if cells are dehydrated in increasingly concentrated OS solutions.",

This work evaluates influence of material (stainless steel, TiN and graphite electrodes), flow rate, electric current density (at constant frequency 50\u00a0Hz) and temperature (in a limited temperature range 65\u201375\u00a0\u00b0C), upon the fouling of skimmed milk. Results prove that the stainless steel electrodes are the worst while the graphite electrodes, where no fouling was observed, are the best, thus confirming the significant role of corrosion and electrochemical phenomena. The paper analyzes also another phenomenon typical for direct ohmic heating and it is an inner overheating of the formed fouling layer, representing a risk of overburning. Theoretical results show that the most intensive overheating occurs at relatively very thin deposit layers, depending upon the specific electrical conductivity of deposits.",

The results showed for all starches, except for WTS, a reduction of the consistency coefficient and the yield stress (\u03c40) with increased intensity of the hydrothermal treatment conditions. Furthermore, \u03c40 vanished for severe treatment conditions. The DIC treatment yielded an increased fluidity and a loss of the conservative modulus of the pastes, as a result of partial gelatinization of starch granules. The extent of the observed effect depended on the botanical origin. Wheat starch exhibited a different behaviour: the consistency coefficient and the conservative modulus being higher for DIC treated starch except for the most severe conditions.",

During baking, the formation of colour is due to the Maillard reaction, and caramelization of sugars. Besides the major influence of this phenomenon on the initial acceptance of products by consumers, it is the responsible for other relevant changes occurring in food during baking, i.e. production of flavour and aroma compounds, formation of toxic products (e.g. acrylamide), and decrease of nutritional value of proteins. As well as baking, the development of browning in bakery products is a simultaneous heat and mass transfer process that occurs mostly in a non-ideal system under non-ideal conditions. In addition, the mechanisms of chemical reactions involved are still not elucidated completely, so the process is difficult to control and represents a major challenge for food engineers. Effects of browning on properties of products and experimental, modelling and technological aspects of colour formation during baking are reviewed.",

     "abstract": "Objective assessment of pork quality is important for meat industry application. Previous studies using spectral approaches focused on using color and exudation features for the determination of pork quality levels without considering the image texture feature. In this study, a Gabor filter-based hyperspectral imaging technique was presented to develop an accurate system for pork quality level classification. Texture features were obtained by filtering hyperspectral images with two-dimensional Gabor functions. Different spectral features were extracted from Gabor-filtered images and hyperspectral images. The principal component analysis (PCA) was used to compress spectral features over the entire wavelengths (400\u20131000\u00a0nm) into principal components (PCs). \u2018Hybrid\u2019 PCs were created by combining PCs from hyperspectral images with PC(s) from Gabor-filtered images. Both K-means clustering and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied to classify pork samples. Results showed that, the accuracy of K-mean clustering analysis reached 78% by 5 hybrid PCs and 83% by 10 hybrid PCs, which were 15% and 28% higher than the results without using texture features. The highest classification accuracy using LDA reached 100% by 5 hybrid PCs. Furthermore, the cross-validation technique was applied for evaluating how the classification results would generalize to independent pork sample sets. A total of 210 partitions (different training and testing sets) were used to obtain the unbiased statistical classification results. The overall classification accuracy reached 84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a095% confidence interval) by 5 hybrid PCs and was 72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% when no Gabor filter-based spectral features were used. Thus, a statistically significant improvement was achieved using image texture features. Moreover, the classification results strongly suggested that the texture features along the direction of \u03c0/4 offered more useful information for the differentiation of the four main levels of pork quality.",

A total of 264 plums (Prunus salicina L.) cv. \u2018Black Diamond\u2019, \u2018Golden Globe\u2019, \u2018Golden Japan\u2019, \u2018Fortune\u2019, \u2018Friar\u2019 and \u2018Santa Rosa\u2019, received and stored at 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 95% RH for 9\u00a0days, were used to build calibration models using different spectral signal pre-treatments and the modified partial least squares regression method. The two NIR instruments evaluated provided good precision, although the diode-array instrument yielded slightly greater precision for soluble solid content; statistic values were r2\u00a0=\u00a00.73 and the standard error of cross validation (SECV)\u00a0=\u00a01.11% for calibration, and r2\u00a0=\u00a00.68 and the standard error of prediction (SEP)\u00a0=\u00a01.22% for validation. Firmness measurements were less precise in both instruments, though again slightly better in the diode-array instrument: r2\u00a0=\u00a00.64 and SECV\u00a0=\u00a01.77\u00a0N for calibration; and r2\u00a0=\u00a00.61 and SEP\u00a0=\u00a02.30\u00a0N for validation, respectively. The performance of the two instruments for classifying plums by variety and by refrigerated post-harvest storage duration (0, 6 and 9\u00a0days) was evaluated using partial least square-discriminant analysis. A total of 96.5 % of samples were correctly assigned to their variety, while 94.5 % of plums were correctly assigned to their refrigerated storage day. In general, promising results were obtained with both instruments, with similar levels of accuracy for the measurements for soluble solid content, variety and refrigerated storage duration; the prediction model developed using the diode-array spectrophotometer provided better results for firmness.",

A study case of modeling and validating the heat transfer to a single stationary copper sphere of 20-mm diameter impinged by a single round jet of liquid was carried out using computational fluid dynamics. The simulations were performed using parameters such as: velocity of the liquid at the orifice exit (2.36\u20137.07\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121), temperature of the liquid refrigerant (\u22125 to \u221215\u00a0\u00b0C) and distance between the orifice and the stagnation point of the sphere (1 and 5\u00a0cm).

The main objective of this study was to determine a minimal number of spectral fluorescence bands suitable for detecting microbial biofilms on surfaces commonly used to process and handle food. Spots of biofilm growth were produced on sample surfaces by spot-inoculations of pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella followed by room temperature storage for 3\u00a0days. Subsequently, hyperspectral fluorescence images were acquired from 421 to 700\u00a0nm using ultraviolet-A excitation. Both E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella biofilms emitted fluorescence predominantly in the blue to green wavelengths with emission maxima at approximately 480\u00a0nm. A single-band image at 559\u00a0nm was able to detect the biofilm spots on stainless steel. On HDPE and granite, algorithms using different two-band ratios provided better separation of the biofilm spots from background areas than any single-band images did. The biofilm spots on stainless steel, HDPE, and granite could be detected with overall detection rate of 95%. On Formica, too many false positives were present to accurately determine an effective biofilm detection rate. This may have been due to the lower cell population density that was observed for the biofilm spots grown on Formica (approximately 4.3\u20136.4\u00a0log\u00a0cfu\u00a0cm\u22122) as compared to the other surfaces. These findings can be incorporated into developing portable hand-held imaging devices for sanitation inspection of food processing surfaces.",

In addition, microstructure analyses were performed, separately staining RCN and WPI, by Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy (CSLM). Both small and large deformation tests indicated that increasing addition of WPI prior to the cooking process of RCN resulted in gels exhibiting higher storage and deformability moduli than WPI-free samples. Increasing shear rates during cooking also affected the rheological properties of RCN\u2013WPI gels, and stronger gels were formed as the shear rate during cooking was increased. Despite the data dispersion among replicates, the effect of shear rate on gel strength were evident for RCN gels with 6.3% WPI and relatively clear for gels with 2.3% WPI; however, the trend was uncertain for WPI-free RCN gels. Possible explanations for this observation are that when increasing WPI levels in the presence of RCN and heat, disulfide-thiol exchange reactions between denatured WPI and \u03ba-casein (\u03ba-CN) are increased and possibly promoted by shear rate, resulting in stronger and more cross-linked gel structure. CSLM results were not conclusive to support this hypothesis.",

The results can aid in decision making for catching and processing cod, provided that strong relationship exist between different links in the value chain of cod.",

     "abstract": "A cylindrical cheese product with an irregular cross sectional geometry is cooled by partial immersion in brine. It is essential to calculate the temperature\u2013time history of the product during this cooling phase to ensure its microbiological safety. The heat transfer analysis is complicated by both the non-standard product geometry and the non-uniform surface heat transfer coefficients that prevail. The flotation behaviour of the cheese at the air/brine interface is analysed to determine the heat transfer areas exposed to each cooling fluid. A finite element model is developed to predict temperature histories at various points in the product and to determine the slowest cooling region in the product. The cooling performance of the cheese is also studied experimentally. Comparison of the theoretical and experimental temperature histories is complicated by uncertainty in the location of the thermocouples in the product. By statistically quantifying the imprecision in thermocouple position, the expected temperatures in each region of interest can be found from the thermal model by Monte Carlo sampling. With the model, the top region of the cheese stick has been shown to determine cooling time because the existence of the non-uniform boundary condition is significant in determining the evolution of temperature.",

     "abstract": "Successful modelling of the thermal behaviour of food products requires accurate knowledge of both the thermal properties of the product and the cooling media to which it is exposed to and a correct approach to validation of the model output against experimental temperature histories. This procedure is complicated where there is uncertainty in the location at which temperature is measured in the product. The cooling of a soft cylindrical cheese product that is partially immersed in brine and air is examined. As the cheese is very deformable, it is not possible to exactly identify the measurement location of the temperature-recording thermocouples. The Uniform and Exponential probability distributions were found to best represent the variability in thermocouple location at the centre and surface of the product, respectively. Expressions for the mean measured temperature at the centre and surface that result from the distributed nature of thermocouple location were obtained. These expressions were used to derive equivalent locations in the cheese which should be used when comparing model and experimental temperature predictions. The theoretical approach was also checked against Monte Carlo simulations and there was excellent agreement between them. It was shown that when validating model temperature histories against experimental readings that this phenomenon must be taken into account.",

The survey covered the unit operations performed, level and pattern of energy consumption and technologies in use for cashew nut processing. The energy consumption and production of mills was analyzed to compute the disparities in energy consumption to produce the same quantity of similar product in term of installed capacity (P), Production (Pr), percent production capacity utilization (PPCU), energy (En) and energy intensity (EI).The study revealed that, the small scale cashew nut mills in Konkan region of Maharashtra (India) widely followed steam roasting process due to better control over the process which retain the valuable CNSL in the shell as well as generate the huge quantity of shell for further utilization as a fuel. The average working days of the mills were about 227\u00a0days in the year depending on the rainy season and availability of raw cashew nut seeds. The average installed production capacity of the surveyed mills was about 9800\u00a0kg of raw cashew nut seeds per annum. The actual raw material processed by these mills was in the tune of 5833\u00a0kg per annum, which revealed the average percent plant capacity utilization of 55% only. The women workers were prominent in the small scale cashew nut processing mills.The regression analysis of relationship between energy and production revealed the best fit of the form of power law i.e. En\u00a0=\u00a0A\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(Pr)B where \u201cA\u201d is the constant and the coefficient \u201cB\u201d is commonly known as the Energy Elasticity. It was observed that, the energy intensity in the cashew nut processing mills producing the similar product varied from 2.15\u00a0MJ/kg to 3.80\u00a0MJ/kg. The regression analysis of relationship between energy intensity and production revealed the best fit of the form of power law i.e. En\u00a0=\u00a0A\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(Pr)\u2212B. The negative exponent \u2018B\u2019 shows a decline in the value of energy intensity with increase in production. It was observed that the frequency of the number of firms in each PPCU range is a bell-shaped curve, which clearly shows about 91 (75%) of the total samples were in PPCU range less than 65% with average energy intensity of 2.9\u00a0MJ/kg. This gives considerable scope for saving of energy with better utilization of installed production capacity in the tune of 25.84%.",

The membranes of 25 and 100\u00a0kDa showed very satisfying results with regard to the concentration of pectin solutions as they were able to separate it from cations and phenols. The membrane of 25\u00a0kDa was also able to partially remove the heavier fragments of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavonols, and simultaneously to sustain the antioxidant properties of the phenol containing beverage in the permeate stream. Finally, nanofiltration clarified the beverage from cations that passed in the permeate stream, but this process resulted in loss of antioxidant compounds, too.",

It defines the apple tissue microstructure that is correlated to many other apple properties. In this article multifractal analysis (MFA) has been used to study the multiscale structure of the PSD using generalized dimensions in three varieties of apples (Jonagold, Greenstar, and Kanzi) based on X-ray imaging technology (8.5\u00a0\u03bcm resolution). Tomographic images of apple samples were taken at two positions within the parenchyma tissue: close to the peel and near to the core. The images showed suitable scaling properties. The generalized dimensions were determined with an R2 greater than 0.98 in the range of moment orders between \u22121 and +10. The variation of Dq with respect to q and the shape of the multifractal generalized spectrum revealed that the PSD structure of apple tissue has properties close to multifractal self-similarity measures. Comparisons among cultivars showed that, in spite of the complexity and variability of the pore space of these apple samples, the extracted generalized dimensions from PSD were significantly different (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The generalized dimensions D0, D1, D2, and the quantity D0\u2013D2 could be used to discriminate tissue samples from different positions or cultivars. Also, high correlations were found between these parameters and the porosity (R2\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a00.935). These results demonstrate that MFA is an appropriate tool for characterizing the internal pore-size distribution of apple tissue and thus may be used as a quantitative measure to understand how tissue microstructure affects important physical properties of apple.",

Physical (thickness and color) and mechanical (tensile strength and percent elongation) properties of edible chitosan films plasticized at four glycerol concentrations (0%, 25%, 75% and 125% w/w chitosan) and prepared by three drying methods, namely, hot air drying (\u224840\u00a0\u00b0C), vacuum drying and low-pressure superheated steam drying (LPSSD) (90\u00a0\u00b0C, 10\u00a0kPa) were investigated. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was used to determine the glass transition temperature to verify the compactness of edible chitosan films. It was found that the drying methods and plasticizer concentration significantly affected the drying time, tensile strength, percent elongation and glass transition temperature of the films. On the other hand, the drying methods and plasticizer concentration did not affect the thickness and final moisture content of the film samples at lower glycerol concentrations. In the cases of vacuum drying and LPSSD, there was a limiting value of plasticizer concentration (25% w/w) beyond which the effect of the plasticizer concentration on the mechanical properties was negligible. In all cases, the color of all tested films was not significantly different.",

The study was devised to test the effectiveness of the encapsulation system in the prevention of interaction between ferrous fumarate and iodine, and preservation of the iodine in iodized salt. The results confirmed that direct iodine\u2013iron interaction occurred in the DFS samples when the iron compound was added without proper coating.

Results showed that vacuum impregnation (VI) with lactic acid solution increased the acidification degree to a greater extent than processing carried out at atmospheric pressure.

Otherwise, samples submitted to conventional dipping at atmospheric pressure showed a RpH of 0.968. Vacuum level was found to be the most important variable influencing the variations in total mass and pH. Vacuum impregnation led to an increase in diffusion rate of hydrogen ions into the vegetable tissue due to the increase in contact area between acid solution and cells. Moreover, a direct correlation between pH reduction on the one hand, and vacuum application period and relaxation time on the other, was observed.

In this study the effect of electrodialysis pretreatment prior to spray drying to produce low-salt fish sauce powder, which is a more shelf-stable and convenient product compared with liquid fish sauce, was investigated. Product recovery, morphology and selected physicochemical properties, i.e., moisture content, water activity, hygroscopicity, as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fish sauce powder were determined.

The new experimental setup allowed the particle temperature to reach higher values by using an insulated drying chamber and also allowed the particle glass-transition temperature to reach lower values by maintaining a higher gas humidity with the aid of a condenser unit attached to the dryer. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and moisture-induced sorption analysis were used to verify the crystallinity of the spray-dried lactose powders. These analyses showed a higher degree of crystallinity for the particles than have previously been reported in the literature. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic analyses were further used to identify different lactose anomers.

The approach involves constant rate heating of powder under compression and measurement of changes in either gap distance (Method 1) or normal force (Method 2). Significant increases in the rate of change of these parameters was shown to correspond with Tgr. The techniques were applied to skim milk, micellar casein and whey permeate powders and a range of fat-enriched micellar casein powders. Tgr temperatures, so obtained, were compared with glass transition temperatures (Tg) determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Methods 1 and 2 gave predictions for non-fat dairy powders of Tg endset (Tge) with SEP of 8.8 and 4.4\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. These novel techniques provide an accurate means of determining glass transitions in dairy powders, including high protein and fat-containing powders, whose relaxation properties can be difficult to measure by DSC.",

Freezing points were fitted to the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation adjusted with un-freezable water, and glass transition was fitted to the Gordon\u2013Taylor model. Glass transition decreased with a decrease in solids content, confirming the plasticizing effect of water on date solids.

Inulin particles in water environment absorbed water which caused an increase in viscosity of the inulin suspensions. Different temperatures of preparation, cooling rates and viscosity increase which appeared during the stirring of inulin suspensions did not significantly change the rheological parameters of the final gels in contrast to heating rates (p\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a00.05). In spite of rigid laboratory conditions high standard deviation for hardness and apparent viscosity showed how difficult the process of an inulin crystallization is to control. Rheological properties of inulin model spread exhibited thixotropic and shear thinning behaviour which made it similar to commercial spread.

Heat treatments at similar temperatures and times were compared to the use of HPCD, wherein it was observed that HPCD was more effective. The total inactivation (5 log10 cycles) of the yeast took place at 55\u00a0\u00b0C with HPCD while it was necessary to reach 70\u00a0\u00b0C when only heat was applied. Required pressures and exposure times were relatively low (\u2a7d6\u00a0MPa and on the order of minutes) because of the direct contact between the CO2 and the pear. The pH and \u00b0Brix were not affected by the HPCD treatment; however, the pears lost their texture and became darker due to a decrease in vitamin C and enzymatic browning. Peroxidase activity was only partially reduced. The addition of an antioxidant did not help to prevent darkening. Therefore, HPCD could be a low temperature conservation method that is superior to conventional thermal treatments for the preparation of fruit preserves where a firm texture is not essential.",

The biggest firmness losses relative to initial textures found after cooking were: FHIA 20 (20-fold) and FHIA 18 genotypes (40-fold) after 2\u00a0h, and Guineo (100-fold) after 98\u00a0min. The extent of starch gelatinization was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and correlated to the amylographic maximum slope using rapid visco analyzer.

     "abstract": "Food processes are systems featuring a large number of interacting microbiological and/or physicochemical components, whose aggregate activities are nonlinear and are responsible for the changes in food properties. As a result of time limits, financial constraints and scientific and technological obstacles, knowledge regarding food processes may be obtained from various sources of know-how such as expert operators, scientific theory, experimental trials etc. Faced with this fragmented and heterogeneous knowledge, it is difficult to implement mathematical models in the form of equations capable of representing and simulating all different phenomena that occur during the process. It is necessary to develop practical mathematical tools capable of integrating and unifying the knowledge puzzle in order to have a better understanding of the whole food process. With this aim in mind, the concept of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) provides a practical mathematical formalism that makes it possible to describe complex dynamical systems tainted with uncertainty. It relies on probabilistic graphical models where the graphical structure of network defines highly-interacting sets between variables and probabilities take uncertainty pertaining to the system into account. To illustrate our approach, we focused on cheese ripening that still remains an ill-known and complicated process to control where capitalised knowledge is fragmented and incomplete. Based on the available knowledge, we propose a global representation/modelling and an explicit overview of the whole ripening process by means of dynamic Bayesian networks. That means we define a model allowing to describe a network of interactions taking place between variables at different scales (i.e. microbial behaviour as well as sensory development) during the ripening. Model has been tested with new experimental trials not available in the learning database. Simulated results are close to experimental data presenting an average adequacy rate of about 85% according to the admitted errors provided by experts highlighting its predictive character.

     "abstract": "A major research gap is the lack of packaging materials that can provide the release of active compounds at rates suitable for a wide range of food packaging applications. For this reason an anti-microbial/antioxidant release system for food packaging applications was realized by incorporation of propolis into Polylactic acid (PLA) film. The composition of the films was modified by adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) and calcium bentonite (CB) to the initial PLA casting solution; dispersed structures in fact open the molecular network and increase migration rates. The presence of the anti-microbial compound is required essentially at the food surface where the microorganisms are numerous and where they are intended to grow. The diffusivity of four polyphenols was measured in water and ethanol as food simulating liquids (FSL) and the concentration of additives at the interface PLA/Food Simulant was calculated using Fickian models. The external mass transfer coefficient at the interface polymer/FSL could be neglected (with Bi number higher than 200). This is due to the low diffusivity values of propolis polyphenols in the PLA matrix (0.03\u20130.83\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u201313\u00a0m2/s) which lead to a predominant internal mass transfer phenomenon compared to the external one in the system PLA/water. The concentration at interface at equilibrium was different for each substance and depended of the thermodynamical parameter K. Such a delivery system for direct contact with liquid aqueous medium would be a very efficient delivery system because some active agents (polyphenols acids) would be released in relevant quantity in the food whereas others (flavonoids) would remain in the polymer to act at the polymer/food interface.",

Here, we describe an efficient and robust multi-criteria optimization method which can be successfully applied to large dynamic systems, like those arising from the modelling of thermal processing of foods.

Then an adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) is used to automatically select the best features for discriminating between blemishes and non-blemishes. With this approach, different features can be selected for different potato varieties, while also handling the natural variation in fresh produce due to different seasons, lighting conditions, etc. The results show that the method is able to build \u201cminimalist\u201d classifiers that optimise detection performance at low computational cost.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of bran moisture content, and the influence of sub-zero temperatures on the mechanical properties of whole bran layers and hand isolated bran tissues (outer pericarp, intermediate layer, aleurone layer), to get information on their potential breakage behavior during fractionation processes and determine the most suitable working conditions to develop efficient processes. The mechanical properties of bran strips were assessed by stress\u2013strain tests using a dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer, with temperature control and relative humidity control. This work showed that it is possible to modulate the mechanical properties of bran samples by modifying their moisture content and the temperature. The extensibility (ultimate strain) of bran tissues was positively correlated to their moisture content (from 9% to 21%, w.b.) and to the temperature (from \u2212100 to 25\u00a0\u00b0C), whereas their stiffness (Young modulus) was negatively correlated to these parameters. In certain conditions, the constitutive layers of whole bran strips broke at different locations, showing that these layers could be dissociated. At temperatures of \u221250\u00a0\u00b0C and below, whole bran and intermediate layers seemed to lose their plasticity. This phenomenon could be linked to a small glass transition detected between \u221240 and \u221250\u00a0\u00b0C in the intermediate layer. These results may allow adapting fractionation processes for a better use of bran.",

Effects of the blend ratios on the solution properties and morphology of the resulting electrospun products were studied. The results showed that EA lacked sufficient entanglement and also possessed very high surface tension, thereby being unable to form nanofibers. The addition of CA and surfactant (Tween40\u00ae) decreased both the electrical conductivity and the surface tension of the blends (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which facilitated the formation of CA\u2013EA blend nanofibers. Scanning electron microscopic images showed that the continuity of the blend fibers was improved with an increase in the EA ratio. Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and thermo-gravimetric analysis results indicated that the obtained fibers were composed of both CA and EA constituents. This study demonstrated a potential to fabricate edible nanofibers from natural food biopolymers using the electrospinning technique. Due to the properties of EA, these nanofibers could provide new functionalities with respect to in vivo-controlled release of nutraceuticals and drugs.",

As acrylamide is classified as a probable human carcinogen, the knowledge of critical processing variables leading to its formation is needed to ensure safety requirements.In this work, acrylamide formation during deep-frying of potato samples is analyzed in space and time through a joint HPLC-MS/MS measurement and a computational fluid dynamics simulation. Such an approach allowed to describe the thermal and physico-chemical history of processed potatoes to bring forth their complete and validated multidimensional distributions of acrylamide concentrations during deep-frying.

The identification of the mechanical parameters is handled using an optimisation technique based on a error-gradient method. The purpose of the optimisation is to compute the set of mechanical parameters that makes the best match between the FE and the experimental results. In the first linear part of the force\u2013deflection curve, a unique Young\u2019s modulus value is predicted assuming isotropic behaviour for all studied samples. In the plasticity part, two quantities namely tangent modulus and yield stress are suggested to describe the plasticity behaviour of the starchy composites. Failure possibility is assessed using maximum strain criterion, where failure probability distribution within the sample is computed. The predicted results show that the simple elastoplastic model is a realistic model to describe the mechanical behaviour of the starchy composite up to failure. Different distributions of failure probability are predicted depending on which strain component is used to assess the failure possibility.",

Cell wall modifications were also studied through sequential extractions of polysaccharides from the alcohol-insoluble residues (AIR) obtained from each tissue. Irradiation seemed to contribute to higher cell\u2013cell adhesion through increasing of calcium-cross linking at the middle lamellae regions, in addition to an increment of cross-links of polymers into the cell wall. Chemical modifications produced in the cell walls as a response to higher levels of H2O2 and subsequent POX mediated effects, were visualized structurally as a more elastic behaviour of irradiated tissues and rigidification of cell walls of treated roots, though puncture test did not reveal significant differences. Microscopy showed a continuum of thick cell walls in beet root tissue, which suffered slight modifications after irradiation, coherent with the bio-chemical results obtained.It can be concluded that irradiation doses of 1 or 2\u00a0kGy produced bio-chemical changes in cellular contents as well as in the cell wall constitutive networks which not necessarily could be sensed by consumers as it was objectively evaluated through a puncture test. At the same time, the mentioned changes involved an increase in the antioxidant capacity of red beet root tissue, showing that studied doses could be interesting to be used in the frame of a combined technique for red beet processing.",

In the study different thicknesses, air drying temperature, maturity degree and non-isotropic mass diffusion were considerate. The 2D temperature and moisture distributions inside the slice were predicted by using a theoretical model. The water effective diffusion coefficient, the convective heat and mass transfer coefficients, the drying curves and the center temperature were getting by the experimental model. A parametric study was carried out in the ranging of air drying temperatures from 50 to 70\u00a0\u00b0C, slices with thickness of 2\u20135\u00a0mm and maturity degree from 13.2 to 22\u00b0Brix. It was found from the experimental results that slices of Ataulfo mango present an isotropic behavior with an uncertainty of 2.47%. The drying rate reduces in 4.5% as 1\u00a0mm thickness increase, and decreases in 8.0% for each 1\u00b0Brix increased.",

The efficacy of cellulose-based coating on fresh egg quality during 28-day storage at ambient temperature was investigated in terms of weight loss, pH, and albumen quality. The selected formulation obtained by a response surface analysis was 1.00% w/v PEG-400 and 4.00% w/v SPB. An edible cellulose-based solution was prepared for eggshell coating. A batch of fresh, grade AA 1-day eggs was coated with cellulose-based coating solution. The other batch consisted of uncoated eggs, which served as the control. Lower weight loss (4.28%) was observed in the cellulose-based coated eggs, compared to 8.83% for the uncoated eggs. The pH in albumen of coated and uncoated eggs increased from 8.71 and 8.72 to 9.44 and 9.76, respectively, after 4\u00a0weeks of storage. For albumen quality, Haugh units indicated that after 7\u00a0days, cellulose-based coated eggs changed from grade AA to grade A, and remained in grade A throughout the storage period; whereas after 5\u00a0days, uncoated eggs started to change from grade AA to grade A, and continually degraded to grade B during the 4\u00a0weeks of storage. This study highlights the promising use of cellulose-based coating to enhance the shelf life of fresh eggs.",

The results showed that increasing solute concentration and process temperature resulted in a higher reduction in moisture contents of kaffir lime peel and increase in water loss and solid gain rates. Analysis of variance showed significant effects (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of all processing factors except process temperatures for water loss. Multilayer feedforward neural network (MFNN) was proposed to predict percentages of water loss and solid gain of kaffir lime peel during osmotic dehydration based on three processing factors as inputs. The best network with the lowest average mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0066 and the highest average regression coefficient (r2) of 0.9725 from normalized training and validating data sets was composed of one hidden layer with five hidden neurons and used Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm as a training algorithm. A simulation test showed good generalization of the successfully trained MFNN model with the average MSE of 6.5813 and 5.9340, and average r2 of 0.9745 and 0.9632, respectively, for water loss and solid gain.

An adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was therefore used to model the process descriptively. Initially, two primary networks were obtained either by grid partition or subtractive clustering. Although grid partitioning led to an ANFIS with higher recognition capability, we continued to improve the ANFIS obtained by subtractive clustering because it described the process with so fewer rules. Increased number of epochs resulted in a model with higher recognition capability while maintaining its simple structure. When the squash factor increased from 1.25 to 1.45, recognition capability of model was further increased and its rule base became simpler (16 fuzzy rules). Finally an ANFIS was generated by applying a lower range of influence. It possessed the highest recognition capability amongst the models but with a comparatively more complex rule base (41 fuzzy rules).",

The data reveal that both saccharides and amino acids influence polyphenol recovery positively and negatively, depending on the experimental conditions and the resin type; possible explanations for these findings are discussed.

The drying methods tested were convective (CD) at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and vacuum-microwave (VMD), as well as a combination of convective pre-drying and VM finish-drying (CPD\u2013VMFD). The volatile compounds of fresh and dried oregano were extracted by steam-hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC\u2013MS. Oregano drying kinetics was described by a simple exponential model for CD and CPD\u2013VMFD, while VMD kinetics consisted of two periods: linear until a critical point and exponential beyond that point. Thirty-four compounds were tentatively identified, with carvacrol, thymol, and \u03b3-terpinene, being the major components. The total volatiles concentration of fresh oregano (33.0\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121) decreased significantly during drying, independently of the method used (CD: 10.2\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121, CPD\u2013VMFD: 13.1\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121, and VMD: 27.9\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121).

Four RTD models, namely axial dispersion, extended tanks in series, generalized convection and PFR\u00a0+\u00a0CSTR association, were adjusted after convolution with the E-curve of the detection system. The generalized convection model provided the best fit because it could better represent the tail on the tracer concentration curve that is caused by the laminar velocity profile and the recirculation regions.

The major processing variables investigated included electrical conductivities of carrier fluid and particles, particle thermal diffusivity, surface heat transfer coefficient, particle size, particle concentration, flow rate, and initial product temperature. The response variables as the indicators of effects from processing variable deviations were the process temperatures and accumulated lethality values for both carrier fluid and particles at the end of holding tube. The results demonstrated that under giving base processing conditions with a control target process temperature of 133\u00a0\u00b0C (the carrier fluid temperature at the entrance of the holding tube or the end of heating tube), increasing carrier fluid electrical conductivity from 1.42 to 2.13\u00a0S/m at a reference temperature of 70\u00a0\u00b0C, particle size from 16 to 24\u00a0mm, and flow rate from 1600 to 2400\u00a0L/h could result in lower particle center temperature at the end of holding tube, while increasing particle electrical conductivity from 0.96 to 1.44\u00a0S/m at a reference temperature of 70\u00a0\u00b0C, thermal diffusivity from 1.16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 to 1.74\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0m2/s, surface heat transfer coefficient from 112 to 168\u00a0W/\u00b0C/m2, particle concentration from 52% to78%, and initial product temperature from 56 to 84\u00a0\u00b0C could generate higher particle center temperature.

The acceptable deviation ranges were built up for six major processing variables under meeting the required target Fo (at the particle center) values.

Conventional drying of fruits and vegetables is often accompanied by changes in color, texture, and taste. Suitable pretreatments can improve the drying process by reducing the drying time, yielding higher-quality products, and energy savings. In this study, two varieties of apples, Amasya and red delicious, green beans and carrots were pretreated with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) at different pressure\u2013time\u2013temperature combinations (100\u2013300\u00a0MPa for 5\u201345\u00a0min at 20 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C) prior to drying.

Improving the drying conditions by increasing the drying temperature generally masked the effect of HHP pretreatment on drying rate. Generally, pressures of more than 100\u00a0MPa caused cell permeabilization resulting in higher drying rates. Among 14 models, the modified Page model was found to best explain the drying behaviors and model constants were evaluated accordingly. The Tukey multiple comparison test was applied on characteristic drying times to evaluate the relative effects of different pretreatments and drying conditions.",

Fiber-containing formulations affected bread specific volume and crumb hardness, and those characteristics were also dependent on both the breadmaking process (conventional or BOT) and the storage conditions of the par-baked bread (low or sub-zero temperatures). The inclusion of resistant starch (RS) and fiber blend in the bread formulation induced a reduction in the specific volume of the bread and an increase of hardness. Crumb image analysis indicated that breadmaking process affected significantly the number of alveoli. The storage of par-baked breads at low temperatures accelerates crumb hardening during staling, and that effect was greatly dependent on the duration of the storage, being that effect magnified in the case of breads containing fiber blend. Therefore, formulations should be carefully checked with the specific breadmaking process to be followed. Special attention should be paid to the storage conditions of the partially baked bread, since they significantly affect the technological quality of fresh breads and their behaviour during staling.",

During steeping, water and calcium absorption kinetics were determined in grains and apparent diffusion coefficients were calculated using Fick\u2019s second law. Changes in thermal properties were determined. Cooking temperature and agitation had significant effects on the chemical and physical properties of grains and nejayote. Soluble and suspended solids and total sugar in nejayote showed a linear trend over time for different temperatures, while pericarp removal during both cooking and steeping reached over 90%. Cooking temperature had a significant effect on water and calcium absorption in grains. Calcium and water diffusion were described adequately using Fick\u2019s model.

In a first theoretical approach, numerical integration of pressure, temperature-profiles and kinetic data of inactivation of the pTTIs, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens \u03b1-amylase and Bacillus subtilis \u03b1-amylase, was applied to translate hypothetical temperature profiles under pressure into indicator read-outs. This resulted in the definition of the application window with regard to initial temperature of the pressure medium (equal to the high pressure wall), the pressure level, build-up rate and holding time. Both indicators showed great potential for use in HP pasteurization processing. Secondly, in an experimental part, the temperature uniformity in a horizontally oriented, industrial scale HP equipment was mapped for the first time, using these indicators. Differences in indicator read-outs were obtained in the radial plane of the HP vessel, and based on the kinetic data of the pTTIs, attributed to temperature differences. Of course, this temperature non-uniformity will only result in process non-uniformity if the temperature dependency of the kinetics of the target attribute (safety, quality) is sufficiently temperature sensitive in the studied pressure, temperature-range.",

For the design of the insulating carrier in high-pressure thermal (HPT) processing, it is imperative to know the extent of compression heating of the materials used, to achieve the best combination of insulation, compression heating and other design features to give the most uniform temperature treatment to the product. In this study, the compression heating properties of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) during high-pressure processing were investigated under near-adiabatic conditions. The plastic polymers were pressurised at varying initial temperatures (5\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C) up to 750\u00a0MPa. Pressure/temperature profiles were recorded and numerically analysed with a purpose-developed software algorithm to obtain pressure- and temperature-dependent compression heating properties.Pronounced differences in compression heating behaviour of the plastics were found, which may be explained by their thermophysical properties, including density and thermal expansion, and the polymers\u2019 base structure and apparent structural changes during treatment.We propose an approach for the screening and selection of suitable insulating plastics for high-pressure processing (HPP) that takes account of the food material to be processed and the process conditions, i.e., initial and target temperature, and pressure level.",

The influence of field strength (2, 5 and 7\u00a0kV/cm) and grape variety (Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot) in the extraction kinetics was studied. Extraction curves were described by an exponential equation that permits to estimate the extraction rate (k) and the maximum extraction yield (Ymax). An increment of the electric field from 2 to 7\u00a0kV/cm increased the extraction rate of anthocyanins and total phenols for the three varieties investigated. The increment of Ymax due to the application of PEF was more remarkable in Cabernet Sauvignon than in Merlot and Syrah.

     "abstract": "In the present work the results of the mechanism of calcium uptake in nixtamalized corn kernel were studied. The results showed that at a critical time, the calcium uptake in the pericarp suffers a drastic change; this fact cannot be associated only to the diffusive mechanism. The SEM analysis of processed corn kernels, taken at 1\u00a0h of steeping time illustrates a calcium cluster formation. It means that for short steeping times the calcium uptake in the total kernel is governed by an accumulation process in the most external layers of the pericarp and the diffusion process is not relevant. The apparition of micro-holes for critical time in dependence on the temperature indicates that another mechanism is contributing to the calcium uptake. These holes can pass thought the whole pericarp or form an interconnected lattice to develop a percolation path. The holes formations allow the entrance of water and calcium directly to the outermost layers of the endosperm and now the accumulation of calcium is not the predominant mechanism. It could be implied that, at this critical time the percolation of water and calcium thought these holes is the main mechanism to calcium uptake in the corn kernel and the diffusion process is not relevant.",

Adhesion of chocolate to the polycarbonate mould surface was used as a measure for the demoulding properties, and was determined as the force required to separate a flat mould surface from the solidified chocolate sample.

For this purpose, emulsions were characterized by visual analysis, microstructure and rheological measurements. Most of the systems were not stable, showing phase separation a few minutes after emulsion preparation. However, creaming behavior was largely affected by the pH, homogenization pressure or locust bean gum (LBG) concentration. The most stable systems were obtained for emulsions homogenized at high pressure, containing an increased amount of LBG or with pH values close to the isoelectric point (pI) of sodium caseinate, which was attributed to the size reduction of the droplets, the higher viscosity of continuous phase and the emulsion gelation (elastic network formation), respectively. All the studied mechanisms were efficient to decrease the molecular mobility, which slowed down the phase separation of the emulsions. In addition, the use of sodium caseinate was also essential to stabilize the emulsions, since it promoted the electrostatic repulsive interactions between droplets.",

Glucose rejection is slightly affected by salt concentration which may due to pore swelling of CK membranes at high concentration of NaCl. Meanwhile, rejection of NaCl is reduced by the increment of glucose and NaCl concentration which causes concentration polarization. The addition of multivalent salts even induces negative rejection of NaCl in DK membranes. However, both membranes show high rejection of multivalent salts with or without the presence of glucose.

This work is aimed to study the effect of malaxation conditions on process oil yield for unripe \u2018Picual\u2019 olives. Experiments were carried out using Picual fruits harvested at early dates for three consecutive crops seasons. The malaxation conditions assayed using a factorial design were: time (60, 90\u00a0min), temperature (18, 30, 40\u00a0\u00b0C) and micronised talc addition (0, 1%). Olive paste from unripe Picual fruit are classified as difficult pastes. The main factor affecting oil yield was the crop year, while for each crop year the effect of each factor varied considerably. Results indicated as increasing time and temperature gave lower pomace oil losses although its effect varied on crop year. Micronised Natural Talc addition lowered pomace oil content on dry weight. Therefore for early harvesting dates knowing olive characteristics \u2018on line\u2019 is essential to adapt the kneading conditions.",

     "abstract": "Stress relaxation characteristics of moth bean (raw and roasted) flour doughs having different moisture contents were determined at two different strain levels (0.05 and 0.50). The decaying relaxation curves for raw flour showed an initial stress between 2 and 22\u00a0kPa when the moisture content varied from 28% to 34% at a strain of 0.05. Roasted flour doughs exhibited initial stresses between 0.06 and 2\u00a0kPa at moisture contents between 40% and 46%. Dough formation was not possible below 40% moisture content for roasted samples. An increase in moisture content markedly decreased initial and residual stresses. It is desirable that dough should possess a low value of residual stress when used for developing flattened/sheeted products. Models containing two or three parameters were found suitable for large-strain stress relaxation characteristics while low-strain data can be modelled by a 4-element Maxwell model with residual stress.",

The proposed methodology consists in colour segmentation of food images using a distance criterion, obtaining a reduced set of pixels representing univocally all boundaries of food sub-regions, and finally construction of the geometric model through linear interpolation. The procedure was applied to samples of different nature and complexity. The geometric models were assessed in two different ways, i.e. evaluating the performance of the image segmentation step and simulating a chilling process. The former provided an objective assessment while the later verified the usefulness of the geometric models. An optimized scenario was found between the approximation degree of the food boundaries and the computational resources involved in process simulation. Furthermore, the presented procedure can be used to perform food quality evaluation.",

Adsorption kinetics showed the polymers preferred to adsorb the catechins rather than caffeine, and adsorption of catechins and caffeine onto the polymers could be described by the pseudo-second-order model. Isothermal equilibrium curves of catechins and caffeine showed a good fit with Langmuir model. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (Qm) of total catechins (192.85\u2013171.11\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121) was 3.9\u20135.2-folds of caffeine. Adsorption of catechins and caffeine was spontaneous and exothermic process as the change in free energy and enthalpy were negative. Lower temperature was favorable for the adsorption process. Caffeine and catechins were well separated and recovered by eluting polymers-packed column with gradient ethanol, i.e., 30% ethanol elution for separating caffeine, and 80% ethanol elution for recovering catechins. Thus, the synthetic poly(acrylamide-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) could be used as a new adsorbent candidate for producing the decaffeined catechins.",

Solvent engineering was successfully used to reach two objectives: (i) to shift the pressure,temperature-stability of BAA in the HP pasteurization range; (ii) to differentiate the pressure,temperature-range of BAA inactivation from the pressure,temperature-range of inactivation of a previously developed Bacillus subtilis \u03b1-amylase (BSA)-based indicator system (1\u00a0g/L \u2013 0.05\u00a0M MES pH 5.0), towards milder processing conditions.

As these model parameters were inadequate to predict the residual \u03b1-amylase activity of BAA under dynamic conditions correctly, parameters were determined under dynamic conditions and subsequently successfully validated on an independent dynamic data set. Based on the kinetic model and parameters valid under dynamic conditions, isorate contour plots for different inactivation levels were constructed, demonstrating clearly the different application windows of the BAA- and BSA-systems.",

The instrument is a heat flux measuring device that can be used in the industrial baking process. All three heat transfer mechanisms are considered and coupled with turbulent flow. Turbulence is taken into account via the k\u2013\u03b5 realizable model whereas the surface-to-surface model simulates the radiation. Additionally, buoyancy forces are introduced by means of a weakly compressible formulation. The model predictions show a good qualitative agreement with the experimental measurements. A quantitative agreement was obtained to some extent. Limitations came from the difficulty to measure the temperature of the radiant surfaces of the oven. Operating conditions used are typical of bakery products and, as expected, radiation was the dominant mode of heat transfer. The integration of the instrument was useful for assessing the model.

The glass nature of the product during the drying process tended to reduce its shrinkage and to facilitate formation of pores and cracks. The product had a final porosity approaching 80% and most of its evaporated water during drying was replaced by gas. The apparent density strongly varied during drying. Its value decreased from 850\u00a0kg/m3 at the beginning of the drying to about 300\u00a0kg/m3 at the end of the drying. The effective water diffusivity was influenced by shrinkage.

The Deff of figs (peeled and unpeeled) was estimated by the method of slopes. The Deff of the peeled figs was higher than this of the unpeeled figs presenting smaller differences as drying temperature was increased.

Electron beam irradiation at the required dose can effectively inhibit pathogens while maintaining produce quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate pathogen inactivation in cantaloupes for optimization of electron beam treatment using dose distributions from Monte Carlo simulation and computed tomography (CT) scan data. 3D geometry and component densities of whole cantaloupes and fresh-cut cantaloupes packed in plastic trays, extracted from CT-scan data, were entered into a radiation transport code (MCNP5) to simulate dose distributions. Lucite (4.2\u00a0cm) was used as an electron absorber when simulating high energy (10\u00a0MeV) irradiation to make the penetration depth similar to the lower energy (1.35\u00a0MeV) electron simulations.For surface irradiation of the whole cantaloupe with a 1.35\u00a0MeV e-beam source, the penetration depth was \u223c0.7\u00a0cm, well beyond the cantaloupe rind. For an entrance dose of 1\u00a0kGy, the log-reductions for Salmonella (D10-value of 0.359) were 3.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43 and 3.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58 at the depths of 0.2 and 0.4\u00a0cm, respectively.

The aim of this study was to determine the salting time needed to reach the same chloride content as commercial dry-cured loins and, to characterise the first step in dry-cured loin production (salting), in loins salted with sodium partial replaced salts. The results indicated a reduction in the salting time when using KCl as NaCl substitute and an increase in the salting time when adding CaCl2 and MgCl2 to the mixture.

Four solid, porous materials (swede, potato, bread, and lightweight concrete) were dried under the same microwave convective drying conditions. Drying behaviour, temperature development, hygroscopicity, dielectric properties, and specific energy consumption were studied. Despite differences in kinetics and product properties, the specific energy consumption (MJ/kg evaporated water) was approximately the same for all materials at intermediate to high moisture contents. When drying was pursued into the hygroscopic region, however, the specific energy consumption increased. The results indicate that a relationship between microwave penetration depth and water activity of the materials may be found. Drying of the food materials was limited by burning either due to temperature runaway in the hygroscopic region or due to development of hot spots, possibly induced by material structure.",

The percentage of fissured kernels increased with increasing drying time and decreasing tempering time. The tempering duration required for long-grain rice was shorter than that for short-grain rice to prevent kernel fissuring. Higher tempering temperatures can effectively eliminate moisture gradients and then lower the rice fissuring generation. Tempering at 50\u00a0\u00b0C reduced fissuring incidence by 32 to 50% compared to tempering at 20\u00a0\u00b0C.

However, CPCs dried by FIR showed significantly lower drying times. Therefore, FIR drying is effective and economical method. CPCs dried by FIR at 80\u00a0\u00b0C showed higher antioxidant activities in several assays, and needed very short drying time. Hence, FIR-80 sample was more potential than other FIR-dried samples.

     "abstract": "Although several empirical models are available in the literature to predict density in solid matrices, only a very limited number of theoretical models have been reported. So far, no model considered the possible variation in the initial air volume existing at the beginning of the drying process. In this contribution, a theoretical model to predict bulk density of dried materials was built by considering two mechanisms that might occur during drying processes. These mechanisms are represented by collapse and shrinkage functions. The predictions obtained by this theoretical model were extensively validated with experimental data published by several independent groups for different food products dried with different technologies. In all these cases, the model gave excellent agreement with the experimental data regardless the topology of the curve bulk density versus moisture content. The model was also compared with other published models. The result of this comparison revealed that the errors resulting from the predictions obtained by the present model are among the smallest. Shrinkage and collapse functions were used to analyze the mechanisms by which bulk density varies during air-drying and freeze-drying. The model showed that both shrinkage and collapse phenomena are dramatically involved during air-drying. However, in the case of freeze-drying, no collapse is observed and only partial shrinkage is taking place. Hence, the present model can be used as a tool to predict the bulk density with excellent accuracy, to understand the dynamic mechanisms involved during drying. Moreover, this model can be incorporated to other models involving the variation of density as a function of moisture.",

     "abstract": "High pressure thermal (HPT) processing is a candidate for commercial scale food sterilisation. During HPT processing, heat is generated volumetrically within the vessel as a result of rapid pressurisation, typically to pressures of 600\u00a0MPa or more. As for traditional retort processes, the temperature profile in the vessel should ideally be uniform at all stages of the process in order to minimise the occurrence of under- and over-processing of individual food containers. Insulating polymeric carriers are employed in (pilot-scale) HPT processing with the aim of maximising heat retention and improving temperature uniformity. However, polymeric carriers can occupy a large portion of the vessel volume, thus compromising load capacity. Load capacity issues are a limiting concern for scale-up of HPT processing to commercial scale. As tool for optimising polymeric carrier design, we have developed an iterative software routine that progressively alters the carrier wall thickness in a previously developed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, and coupled this with an integrated temperature distributor (ITD) routine, which allows us to describe, in a single parameter, overall process performance in terms of heat retention and uniformity. The use of the combined carrier wall thickness/ITD routines was demonstrated for optimising the design of a polymeric carrier in a 35\u00a0L pilot-scale high pressure sterilisation plant, the ITD concept to have applications in HPT processing beyond carrier design, including as a parameter to describe process safety.",

We use this approach to study the four most common disease causing etiologies in the Center for Disease Control (CDC) database of foodborne disease outbreaks in the year 2006, namely Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Norovirus. The analysis reveals numerous patterns of how each of these outbreaks types relates to specific foods and locations. The discovery of such patterns in foodborne disease outbreak data can be very useful is determination and implementation of suitable intervention techniques.

The levels of achieved concentrations meet the standards attained by two commercially available tomato concentrates with concentration ranges 7\u20139 and 10\u201314\u00b0Brix, known as PASSATA and PIZZA SAUCE, respectively.For re-concentration of the post-process diluted osmotic NaCl brines, electrodialysis is proposed as a viable alternative to the commonly used evaporative process. Electrodialysis is an established methodology in the chemical industry for concentrating brines up to the saturation and is far more economical than evaporization.In summary, the use of NaCl brines as osmotic media in a combined direct osmosis\u2013electrodialysis process operated at ambient temperature and low pressure allows concentration of tomato juice to produce tomato concentrates of commercial interest.",

In this work, granules obtained in the laboratory by a simple procedure were used as emulsifying agent in mayonnaise preparation. The aim was to develop a low-cholesterol mayonnaise with properties similar to those of typical mayonnaise. For this purpose, three low-cholesterol formulations prepared in the laboratory were compared with a mayonnaise prepared using yolk and also with a commercial mayonnaise. The rheological characteristics of mayonnaises were evaluated, as well as their microstructure and sensorial properties. In addition, colour and particle size measurements at different times of storage were carried out to assess stability. According to results, the use of granules allows the preparation of a low-cholesterol mayonnaise which shows similar characteristics to those of a typical mayonnaise.",

The drying methods tested were convective (CD) and vacuum-microwave (VMD), as well as a combination of convective pre-drying and VM finish-drying (CPD\u2013VMFD). Rosemary drying kinetics was described by a simple exponential model for CD and VMD, while VMFD kinetics consisted of two periods: linear until a critical point and exponential beyond that point. Volatile compounds of rosemary samples were extracted by steam-hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC\u2013MS. Thirty-four compounds were tentatively identified, with \u03b1-pinene, bornyl acetate, camphene and 1,8-cineole being the major components. The total volatiles concentration of fresh rosemary (135\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121) decreased considerably during both CD (87.2\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121) and VMD (61.9\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121).

     "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of three processing parameters, e.g. product surface temperature, slice thickness and processing time, on blanching and dehydration characteristics of apple slices exposed to simultaneous infrared dry-blanching and dehydration (SIRDBD) with intermittent heating. A three-factor factorial experiment design was conducted to determine the influence of processing parameters on product temperature, moisture reduction, drying rate, residual polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities and surface color change. Slice thickness had a significant effect on product quality and processing characteristics, as faster inactivation of enzymes and quicker moisture reduction took place in thinner slices. A Page model performed well for describing drying behavior during the treatment, and first-order kinetics and a biphasic model fit well for PPO and POD inactivation, respectively. Surface color changes (\u0394E) of apple slices during prolonged heating resulted from non-enzymatic browning with an increase in b value was observed. In order to achieve a 1 log reduction in POD activity, the process resulted in a reduction in moisture from 20% to 59% and in \u0394E from 2.27 to 5.59.

     "abstract": "Maple syrup is a natural sweetener obtained from the transformation of maple sap collected mostly from sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh) in North America. At present, simple physico-chemical tests are used for routine quality control. Inspectors also taste all batches on the market to ensure authenticity. Because of the presence of various aromatic compounds in sap and syrup, intrinsic fluorescence was tested as a means to characterize the physico-chemistry and typicity of maple syrup. Two hundred samples of sap and their corresponding syrup were obtained from various farms in 2003 and 2004. They were analysed by conventional physico-chemical tests and by fluorescence spectroscopy. Two major regions of fluorescence were found, which were mostly the same for sap and syrup. The first one was at 320\u00a0nm, excited at 275\u00a0nm, and the second one at 460\u00a0nm, excited at 360 (syrup) or 370\u00a0nm (sap). The first peak diminishes as harvesting season progresses, while the second peak increases, making it possible to predict the harvesting period of syrup from its spectra (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.88 in 2003 and 0.81 in 2004). Color of syrup (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.91 and 0.88) and bacterial counts in sap (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.75 and 0.78) were also predicted from syrup spectra. Results show that sap spectra are related to syrup spectra and could potentially be used as predictor of quality prior to transformation. Discriminant analysis revealed that between 71% and 95% of syrup samples were correctly classified according to the farm of origin in 2003, and between 78% and 100% in 2004. Proximity was not always a factor of explanation of misclassification, suggesting that precise farm location, rather than the broad region of production is the major factor of typicity.",

The operation of the CBEMR comprises three consecutive stages: (i) proteolysis, (ii) ultrafiltration and (iii) enzyme recycle and re-use. A mechanistic mathematical model comprising zero-order kinetics for the hydrolysis and second-order deactivation for the enzyme was proposed and validated through experiments. Two alternative operation modes were proposed for the CBEMR: isothermal versus non-isothermal operation. The performance of both modes was assessed in terms of enzyme consumption and number of enzyme uses versus the productivity required. Furthermore, the optimisation of both modes was carried out, comparing their optimal operation as enzyme consumption.First, the optimal number of enzyme uses is a function of the productivity required for the CBEMR. The best isothermal operation of the CBEMR yields an optimal number of enzyme uses equal to 4 at 59.7\u00a0\u00b0C for productivity values below 0.59\u00a0h\u22121. That means a maximal saving of enzyme of 18% against a traditional discontinuous batch reactor. Secondly, the non-isothermal optimal operation allows us to improve the yield in comparison to the isothermal operation. As a matter of fact, some additional saving can be achieved (up to 11%).",

The average RMSEP% when forecasting the mass flow rate of the outgoing oil was 4.4% for decanter A and 4.3% for decanter B.When using the empirical model to measure oil recovery efficiency against the mass flow rate of the olive paste, on varying the paste dilution, there is an \u201cindifference point\u201d where the oil recovery efficiency is invariant with respect to the dilution coefficient of the olive paste.

Up to 120,000\u00a0kg olives were processed. Talc and calcium carbonate, with different particle sizes, were assayed at concentrations ranging from 0.3% to 1% by weight. Both coadjuvant types are food grade and are recognized as food additives by EU regulations (E-170 as calcium carbonate and E-553b as talc). Industrial trials were performed at room temperature with no added water, thus avoiding volatile compound loss and hydrosoluble compound content decrease. As a consequence, the obtained oils were more aromatic and their positive attributes more intense, in comparison to other olive oils produced in different operational conditions. In addition, energy requirements were decreased (releasing a lesser amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere) and water uptake was kept to a minimum.Results show that the use of coadjuvants improves the oil extraction yield. The extraction efficacy, defined as the percentage of initial oil that is extracted, increased by 2% by using carbonate in comparison to experiments performed without any coadjuvant, with 91.53% of oil content in the olives being extracted. For the same particle size, calcium carbonate was found to extract a greater oil amount than talc. For a single coadjuvant, the extraction yield decreased as the particle size increased. The best results, in terms of oil extraction yield, were obtained when using 0.3% calcium carbonate. Considering oil quality, no influence by either coadjuvant was detected as oil components remained unaltered during the extraction process. The sensorial evaluation gave the same result for all olive oils, no matter if a coadjuvant was used or not, indicating that these compounds only act physically on the oil extraction process.",

Both coatings caused a reduction of R O 2 and R CO 2 of the cheese (between 0.19- and 1.30-fold for R O 2 and between 0.19- and 1.50-fold for R CO 2 , depending on the temperatures).

The estimated \u201cdifferential\u201d diffusion coefficients were a strongly increasing function of moisture content for all temperatures tested, approaching to the self-diffusion coefficients of water for brown rice moisture contents near to the saturation values. The \u201cintegral\u201d diffusion coefficient corresponding to range of moisture content resulting from soaking conditions were calculated and correlated according to Arrhenius equation with an activation energy of 32.5\u00a0kJ/mol.",

The first part of the work consisted in obtaining coating solutions with the convenient values of wettability for each fruit; such coating solutions were then characterized in terms of their permeability (to CO2, O2 and water vapour), mechanical properties, colour and opacity. Gas transfer rates from mangoes coated with a solution of A. pavonina galactomannan (0.5%), collagen (1.5%) and glycerol (1.5%) were compared with those of mangoes without coating: 28% less O2 consumption and 11% less CO2 production were observed in coated mangoes. The same procedure was performed in apples (in this case using C. pulcherrima galactomannan (0.5%), collagen (1.5%) and no glycerol); the CO2 production and the O2 consumption was approximately 50% lower in apples with coating than in apples without coating. The results suggest that these coatings can reduce gas transfer rates in these fruits, and can be therefore important tools to extend their shelf life.",

Two bruise prediction models were constructed for the damage susceptibility of peach fruit (measured by bruise volume) using multiple linear regression analyses. In the first model, peak contact force and three fruit properties (acoustic stiffness, fruit temperature and radius of curvature) were used as independent variables. In the second model, peak contact force was replaced by the impact energy. Peaches were subjected to dynamic loading by means of a pendulum at three levels of impact. Significant effects of acoustic stiffness, temperature and the radius of curvature and some interactions on bruising were obtained at 5% probability level with the coefficient of determination of 0.97 and 0.98 for models 1 and 2, respectively. It was concluded that lowering the temperature and increasing the radius of curvature and acoustic stiffness will reduce the bruise damage of the peach fruit.",

     "abstract": "This study was carried out to gain a better insight into evaporation and condensation phenomena due to natural convection in a domestic refrigerator. An experiment was undertaken in a refrigerator loaded with 40\u00a0humid plaster cylinders (50\u00a0mm diameter). The weight variation of the cylinders was followed over 12\u00a0days and the rate of water evaporation (or condensation for some cylinders) was calculated. This measured experimental rate was compared with one obtained from a CFD simulation which took into account air flow by free convection, heat transfer (convection, conduction and radiation) and mass transfer (water evaporation and condensation). The position of high evaporation or condensation rate was well predicted despite the fact that the simulation most often underestimated the experimental values. Near the cold wall where condensation was observed (or near the warm wall where evaporation was observed), the cylinder temperature was lower (or higher) than that of air. This demonstrates the importance of the radiative exchanges between the walls and the products inside a refrigerator which in turn can explain condensation or dehydration phenomena.",

Ohmic cooking was faster than the conventional cooking (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Ohmically cooked samples were firmer than those conventionally cooked but yield and fat retention was similar. However, the reduction in volume during cooking was significantly smaller from 5.36% to 6.97% in ohmic cooking than the conventional system which was measured from 26.01 to 31.59. The voltage gradient applied during ohmic cooking was not related to the quality of the cooked meat. These results show that ohmic cooking could be a fast-alternative method for meat products.",

Bread baking is one of the most energy demanding processes (around 4\u00a0MJ/kg), compared with other thermal processes such as canning. However, there is a large variability of data in the literature. For partial baking, bread has to be baked twice. It may also be frozen after part baking, which will increase the total energy demand. Results obtained with equipment used by craft bakeries are presented. Conventional and frozen part baked processes are compared. The effect of occupation ratio on the overall energy demand is also assessed. It was observed that 15\u201320% of the total energy is used for heating up the dough and 10\u201320% for crust drying. Pre-heating of the oven represents another significant energy demand. The energy demand for freezing is comparable to that for baking. An Energy Efficiency Index is used to assess the ratio of energy effectively transferred to the dough during baking. Part baked frozen technology demands about 2.2 times as much energy as conventional bread making process.",

Electric fields above 220\u00a0V\u00a0cm\u22121 promoted death rates of 3\u00a0log10 cycles of E. coli in less than 6\u00a0min, and even higher rates at greater electric fields, while presumably overcoming the thermal degradation caused by conventional high temperature treatments. A non-thermal model was proposed that successfully describes the E. coli death kinetics under this treatment. SEM observations of E. coli cells after the exposure to the MEF treatment, revealed changes at the cell membrane level, indicating a possible cause for the cell death rates. These results show that this treatment holds potential for sterilization of thermolabile products (e.g. serum and other physiological fluids, food products), by itself or as a complement of the traditional heat-dependent techniques.",

At the very beginning of adsorption polyphenol binding is characterized by processes, which may result in the formation of a subsurface surrounding the resin particles and which precede surface reactions, whereas the final phase is dominated by intraparticle diffusion processes. The results presented in this work contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of adsorption mechanisms and of the influence of adsorption conditions.

The results showed that the sprouting of wheat had a significant influence on the grinding process. The average particle size of the pulverized material obtained from the sprouted kernels was almost always significantly lower than those from the sound kernels. The highest changes were observed in the increase of the fraction of particles below a size of 200\u00a0\u03bcm, caused by sprouting. The sprouting caused a decrease in the value of specific grinding energy in all cultivars. Based on the parameters of screen openings and cultivar, the values of specific grinding energy ranged from 35.5 to 141.6\u00a0kJ\u00a0kg\u22121 and from 41.4 to 164.3\u00a0kJ\u00a0kg\u22121 for the sprouted and sound kernels, respectively.

This study treats the pH regulation process of a reactor tank as a grey box with partially known system information. The behaviour of the process is predicted one-step ahead with a first-order grey model. A fuzzy controller takes the prediction together with the current system response to regulate the discharge of base (NaOH) or acid (HCl) solution into the reactor tank to arrive at a desired pH value. The integrated grey prediction fuzzy control (GPFC) strategy is simple in control-law derivation and system implementation and is efficient in computation. The developed GPFC was validated with perform base/acid titration and continuous acidification/deacidification control. The controlled system response error was trivial in the titration and was less than 1% in the continuous control under proper agitation of the reactants. The system was used to control Acetobacter xylinum fermentation for cellulose production. The GPFC scheme exerted smooth control action, achieved a trivial steady-state error in pH control, and yielded more cellulose and acetic acid products but consumed much less material than PID or manual control.",

The Magness-Taylor (MTf) index was used as reference, destructive parameter, to describe the flesh firmness and to set-up predictive models. The digitalized time history of the force was analysed to extract some mechanical indices (peak force, impact duration and impulse) used to predict MTf by simple or multiple regression analyses. Moreover, each point of the entire time history was processed by artificial neural network (ANN) software to predict MTf. The goodness of fit, expressed as R2, was up to 0.823 with the regression models. On the whole, the peak force was the best predictor. The ANNs did not involve a substantial increase in goodness of fit with respect to the best regression models: +8.3%, as mean, 37% as maximum. The speed or position at which the fruit impacts the plate can represent an important parameter influencing the MTf prediction.

A new method for the simultaneous determination of thermophysical properties using a modified version of current probe theory method was proposed. The temperature changes of the probe upon insertion in the sample were fitted to an approximate solution of the heat conduction equation, and the values of two parameters in that solution were determined. Using the values of these parameters, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of each sample were determined. The specific heat of each sample was estimated from the definition of thermal diffusivity. These thermophysical properties were expressed as a function of concentration and temperature.",

The partition coefficients were determined by phase ratio variation method at temperatures between 4 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. AITC showed much stronger partitioning into oil or octanol phase than into air or water phase because of its strong hydrophobic nature. As temperature increased, the oil/air, oil/water, and octanol/water partition equilibria were shifted toward air, oil, and octanol phases, respectively. These partitioning behaviors are attributed that the air-to-oil transfer of AITC is an entropically unfavorable, enthalpy-driven spontaneous process, whereas both water-to-oil and water-to-octanol transfers are energetically unfavorable, entropy-driven spontaneous processes. Canola oil was found to be more effective as a solvent for AITC than olive oil in oil/air system but less effective in oil/water system.",

Although both antioxidants have similar molecular weights, L-tyrosine released into water much more slowly than L-ascorbic acid. The highest antioxidant activity in release test solutions was observed with highly porous L-tyrosine containing films. However, when the porosity of the films reduced, the antioxidant activity of L-ascorbic acid released into solution was found to be higher due to trapping of significant amount of L-tyrosine in dense films. The use of different antioxidants caused different changes in morphological and mechanical properties of the CA films. Varying the structural features of the films with the preparation conditions or using different surfaces of the films allowed the controlled release of each antioxidant.",

     "abstract": "Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) relies on modification of the atmosphere inside a package, achieved by the natural interplay between the respiration of the product and the transfer of gases through the package. Polymeric films are the most usual packaging material but because of the increase in the consumption of fresh-cut products with a higher respiration rate and higher tolerance to CO2, alternative materials are being investigated. The perforation-mediated package is one of those alternatives, where the regulation of the gas exchange is achieved by single or multiple tubes that perforate an otherwise impermeable packaging material. From an engineering point of view, the transport of gases through perforations is a complex phenomenon that involves diffusion gradients together with co-current transport of multiple species, with oxygen entering the package and carbon dioxide leaving it. The influence of one species transport in the other has not been studied so far. The objective of this work was to analyse the effect of initial concentration of CO2 on the effective mass transfer coefficients of O2 ( K O 2 ) and CO2 ( K CO 2 ) in perforation-mediated MAP. K O 2 ranged from (6.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 (m3\u00a0s\u22121) to (28.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 (m3\u00a0s\u22121) and for K CO 2 from (6.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 (m3\u00a0s\u22121) to (28.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 (m3\u00a0s\u22121). On average K O 2 decreased by approximately 15% with an increase of CO2 initial concentration from 25% to 100%. K CO 2 was insensitive to the composition of the gas mix. The permeability ratio (\u03b2) varied from 0.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 to 1.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01. A mathematical model considering the co-current effect of CO2 flux on the gas exchange rate for O2 was developed. These results suggest that there is a significant drag effect in the gas exchange process that should be taken into consideration when designing perforation-mediated MAP.",

Calcium was added by substitution of sodium caseinate by calcium caseinate. Calcium caseinate films have less transparency and more rigidity but they have lower water vapour permeability values than sodium caseinate films. The effect of substitution was different for films with and without lipids. Calcium caseinate increased tensile strength and decreased elongation of films, depending on the level of substitution and lipid presence. Among control films (without lipid), water vapour permeability was reduced when calcium caseinate was present, reaching values of 3.9 (\u00b10.2)\u00a0g\u00a0mm\u00a0kPa\u22121\u00a0h\u22121\u00a0m\u22122. Nevertheless, in the films containing lipids, this reduction was inhibited when the level of sodium caseinate substitution exceeded 50%. Film transparency and gloss was reduced by calcium caseinate and lipid presence, although pure calcium caseinate films were glossier. When taking all the studied variables into account, the films prepared with 2:1 NaCas:CaCas ratio and 70:30 OA:BW ratio showed the most adequate properties.",

Increasing gas sparging rate led to an increase in specific cake resistance. It was observed that increasing gas sparging rate could reduce reversible fouling rather than irreversible fouling.

These models were then reparameterized to enable the aw to be modeled as function of the water phase concentrations of binary and multi-component solutions. This reparameterization enables the modeling of the aw depressing effects of compounds for which sufficient data required to calculate the molecular weight cannot be obtained. Both models were successfully used to predict the aw of some food products including meat and fish products and mayonnaises with average deviations of 0.0052 from the measured aw, and bias and accuracy factors of 0.995 and 1.0057, respectively.",

     "abstract": "The objective of this study was to develop a deterministic modelling approach for non-enzymatic browning (NEB) and ascorbic acid (AA) degradation in orange juice during ultrasound processing. Freshly squeezed orange juice was sonicated using a 1500\u00a0W ultrasonic processor at a constant frequency of 20\u00a0kHz and processing variables of amplitude level (24.4\u201361.0\u00a0\u03bcm), temperature (5\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C) and time (0\u201310\u00a0min). The rate constants of the NEB and AA were estimated by a primary model (zero and first order) while their relationship with respect to the processing factors was tested for a number of models, i.e., second order polynomial, different types of Ratkowsky-type model, and an Arrhenius-type model. The non-monotonic behaviour of NEB has been described more accurately by the use of a polynomial model. The rate constants of AA were described by a similar type of model having a monotonic behaviour. A synergistic effect of temperature for different amplitudes on the rate constant of both NEB and AA was observed, while an antagonistic effect of amplitude on the rate of NEB was evident. The models with the best fit were integrated to produce contour plots for the combined amplitude and temperature. The constructed contour plots illustrate that low temperatures and intermediate amplitudes, i.e., 42.7\u00a0\u03bcm, result in lower NEB and AA deterioration and consequently better quality orange juice. The overall developed modelling approaches exploit quality data in order to identify the optimal processing regions for eliminating quality deterioration of orange juice during ultrasound processing which is of high importance to the food industry.",

To produce partial-parboiled rice using hot-air fluidization technique has been received increasing attention due to simplicity of operation. Thus, the purpose of this work was to investigate the effects of pre-steaming time and drying temperatures on qualities of partial-parboiled rice. The results revealed that head rice yield, pasting temperature and degree of gelatinization increased with an increase in pre-steaming time whereas white belly decreased. The percentage of water uptake of pre-steamed rice decreased with an increase in drying temperature while the percentage of solid loss and stickiness were not affected. The hardness of pre-steamed rice was higher than that of reference rice and it increased with an increase in drying temperature. To obtain the suitable conditions for producing partially-parboiled rice using hot-air fluidization technique, paddy was soaked at temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0h and then it was blown with saturated steam temperature of 102\u00a0\u00b0C for 70\u00a0s (pre-steaming).

Therefore, experiments were carried out to develop a redness index to characterize the dynamics of ripening which was further used to characterize the effect of ozone on storage and ripening. Several gaseous ozone treatments were applied. Color changes from green to red were monitored. Ozone treatment delayed both the development of red color as well as of rotting. Color development and rotting followed a trend like that described by Hill\u2019s equation. Shelf life was enhanced by 12\u00a0days when treated tomatoes were stored at 15\u00a0\u00b0C. The longer shelf like was mainly due to a reduction in surface microbial count.

The dielectric properties of binary mixture of oils were investigated in the frequency range of 101\u00a0Hz\u20131\u00a0MHz. A partial least squares (PLS) model was developed and used to verify the concentrations of the adulterant. Furthermore, the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to classify olive oil sample as distinct from other adulterants based on their dielectric spectra. The results showed that the dielectric spectra of binary mixture of olive oil spiked with other oils increased with increasing concentration of soy, corn, canola, sesame, and perilla oils from 0% to 100% (w/w) over the measured frequency range. PLS calibration model showed a good prediction capability for the concentrations of the adulterant. For olive oil adulterated with soy oil, the results showed that the RMS was 0.053, sd(RMS), 0.017 and Q2 value was 0.967. PCA classification plots for all oil samples showed clear performance in the differentiation for the different concentrations of the adulterant. Each of the oil samples could be easily grouped in different clusters using dielectric spectra.

In addition, M0C was found to be correlated with both the Smith parameters wb and w\u2032, whereas the multilayer water content (MC) was reflected more in w\u2032 than wb. Although the desorption process maintains more water than adsorption, the ratio of M0C to MC was constant irrespective of sorption process. Both M0C and MC showed good correlations with the gelatinization parameters, but the correlations were weaker in the case of adsorption. Therefore, gelatinization may reflect water desorption characteristics, suggesting that hydration is incomplete in the adsorption process and new binding sites of water would be involved to a greater extent in gelatinization.",

Since bacteriostatic emulsifiers often cause the destabilization of emulsions, other type of emulsifiers, such as stability-enhancing ones, are necessary for the long-term stability of emulsions. Four milk-based emulsions were prepared from powdered milk combined with several types of emulsifiers. The long-term stability of emulsions, which was detected by the occurrence of a creaming layer after 3\u00a0months of storage, differed according to the composition of emulsifiers. To understand the reason for the differences in the stability of emulsions, particle size, distribution, \u03b6-potential, and the amount of proteins and phospholipids present in the cream layer (separated oil droplets) in the emulsions were measured. Only the amount of proteins adsorbed onto oil droplets was found to be closely related to the difference in emulsion stability, that is, the more proteins adsorbed, the higher the emulsion stability.

On the contrary, samples treated at 200\u00a0MPa underwent a decrease in elasticity during storage. The water holding capacity of dorsal muscle was also assessed, and it was found to decrease with increasing pressures. Immunoblot studies performed on the main structural proteins revealed that a pronounced time-dependent degradation of desmin, observed in untreated samples, could be prevented by treatment at 400\u00a0MPa.

The results showed that moisture content was a more important factor on system parameters and product properties than cooking temperature. Higher moisture content resulted in lower viscosity of dough in the extruder, shorter residence time and lower conversion ratio of extruder mechanical energy into heat energy, finally reducing significantly the tensile strength, hardness, chewiness and the degree of aggregation.

Also most of the export of litchi is in the form of dried whole litchi fruit. Thermo-physical properties and drying model of litchi fruit is important for optimum design of litchi dryer. This paper presents moisture diffusivity, shrinkage and finite element simulated drying of litchi fruit. The moisture diffusivities of litchi were determined by minimizing the sum of square of deviations between the predicted and experimental values of moisture content of thin layer drying under controlled conditions of air temperature and relative humidity. The components in the form of cylinder for seed and seed stalk and slab for seed coat, shell and flesh were dried in thin layers at the air temperatures of 50, 60, 70 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C and relative humidity in the range of 10\u201325%. The mean diffusivity of flesh, seed and shell of litchi fruit increased with temperature and was expressed by the Arrhenius-type equation, but the diffusivities of seed coat and seed stalk were independent of temperature. The moisture diffusivities of seed coat and seed stalk were much lower than those of the other parts of the litchi. The shrinkage of litchi fruit has also been determined experimentally and it was expressed as a function of moisture reduction. A two-dimensional finite element model has been developed to simulate moisture diffusion in litchi fruit during drying. Shrinkage of the flesh and different component diffusivities of litchi during drying were also taken into account. The finite element model was programmed in Compaq Visual FORTRAN version 6.5. This finite element model satisfactorily predicts the moisture diffusion during drying. Moisture contents in the different components in the litchi fruit during drying were also simulated. This study provides an understanding of the transport processes in the different components of the litchi fruit.",

The maltodextrins, which were used for partial replacement of starch in the recipe for gluten-free dough, were characterised by DE 3.6, 15.3, 18.0 and 21.8. Basing on the obtained results it was concluded, that the addition of applied maltodextrins significantly influences starch gelatinisation, by increasing pasting temperature and reducing viscosity of the obtained pastes. Rheological properties of the obtained dough are also modified by maltodextrins, which weaken its structure and increase deformation sensitivity. The addition of maltodextrins with low DE (3.6) diminishes loaf volume and causes deterioration of bread quality. Maltodextrins with higher DE, especially 18.0 and 21.8, positively influence bread volume and have a beneficial influence on crumb hardening during storage. Maltodextrin with the highest DE is also an effective factor reducing recrystallisation enthalpy of amylopectin.",

The eggs of two brown egg-laying breeds (Bar Plymouth Rock and Rhode Island Red) were stored for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8\u00a0weeks at constant temperatures: 4\u00a0\u00b0C, 8\u00a0\u00b0C, 12\u00a0\u00b0C, and 16\u00a0\u00b0C. The apparent viscosity was measured by a rotational viscometer as a function of shear rate. It was found that yolk samples exhibited shear-thinning (pseudoplastic) behavior. The shear-thinning behavior was fitted well into Herschel\u2013Bulkley model (with a satisfying correlation of R2\u00a0>\u00a00.95). For the selected shearing rate, viscosity was measured in relation to shearing time. The time-dependant viscosity decreased rapidly with time and, at lower share rates, reached an equilibrium state. The time-dependant viscosity was also found to decrease with storage time. The value of pH changed (increased) during storing. No clear dependence between pH value and viscosity was confirmed.",

Defatted soy flakes dispersed in water were sonicated for 15, 30, 60 and 120\u00a0s using a bench-scale ultrasound unit. The ultrasonic amplitudes used were: 0, 21, 42, 63 and 84\u00a0\u03bcmpp (peak-to-peak). The respective power densities were 0.30, 0.87, 1.53 and 2.56\u00a0W/ml. Scanning electron micrographs of sonicated samples showed the structural disruption of soy flakes. The particle size decreased nearly 10-fold following ultrasonic treatment at high amplitudes. Sonication at high amplitude for 120\u00a0s gave the highest increase in total sugar released (50%) and protein yield (46%) when compared with non-sonicated samples (control). Ultrasonic pretreatment was also carried out with and without cooling for temperature moderation. The heat generated during sonication had no significant effect on protein and sugar release from defatted soy flakes. The use of ultrasound can significantly improve protein yield and reduce the overall cost of producing soy protein from flakes.",

The samples exhibited essentially monophasic digestograms, and three digestion models (Duggleby, first-order kinetic and Peleg models) were tested for describing the digestograms. Irrespective of the particle size, starch digestion followed first-order kinetics, and the modified first-order exponential model and Peleg model adequately (mean relative deviation modulus\u00a0<\u00a010%) described the digestograms. With or without an intercept, there was a significant linear relationship (r2\u00a0>\u00a00.61; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) between the reciprocal of the digestion rate constant and the square of the particle size consistent with digestion proceeding by a diffusion-controlled mechanism.

Particle size affected digestion kinetics, water absorption index (WAI), pasting properties, and water solubility index (WSI) of the samples, as did hammer-milling. However, differential scanning calorimetry showed no significant effects of the hammer-milling on starch gelatinisation properties. Although particle size was the primary determinant of digestion properties, small but detectable changes to the grain particle structure due to the hammer-milling affected digestion kinetics, presumably because of additional frictional heat and mechanical effects. Suggestions were made on how to modulate starch digestion, for example to achieve efficient energy delivery to animals from sorghum-based feed.",

The degree of cell membrane damage was evaluated by the tissue electrical conductivity measurement (determination of the cell disintegration index Z). The PEF-treated and freeze\u2013thawed tissues show different structure response on the applied compressive pressure and different filtration\u2013consolidation behaviour. The value of fracture pressure (Pf\u00a0\u2248\u00a058.5\u00a0bar) is the lowest and the value of tissue deformation under fracture (\u03b5f\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.46) is the highest for sugar beet tissue treated by freezing/thawing. PEF treatment leads to more rigid and more fragile tissue structure (Pf\u00a0\u2248\u00a063.8\u00a0bar, \u03b5f\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.28) than freeze\u2013thawed tissue.

Different tissue reactions on the loading pressure evidently reflect the difference between microstructures of treated and untreated tissues. The filtration/consolidation behaviour during liquid expression from a sugar beet tissue also depends on the type and degree of structure denaturation. Tissues treated by PEF and freezing/thawing demonstrate two consolidation stages of expression (primary and secondary). However, the freeze\u2013thawed tissue tends to modify the expression mechanism under the higher loading pressure (60\u00a0bar) with approach to the primary consolidation behaviour. The simplified semi-empirical consolidation model permits a reasonably good prediction of expression behaviour from the denaturated sugar beet tissue and estimation of consolidation coefficient b under different pressures. The extrapolation of curves b(P) shows the value of hypothetical pressure, Pmax\u00a0\u2248\u00a090\u00a0bar at which the consolidation behaviour would be similar to both PEF-treated and freeze\u2013thawed tissues.",

A significant surface contamination occurring during CIP was evidenced, depending on the spore surface properties. Similarly to previously reported observations, when spores were suspended in optimal adhesion conditions (suspension in water at 20\u00a0\u00b0C), the re-adhesion phenomenon was controlled by the flow pattern and contamination levels inside the valve were significantly higher than in tubes. Cleaning strategies should therefore take into account the re-adhesion phenomenon to limit the risk of contamination by the process line.",

The purified salmon oil samples were evaluated for free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide values (PV), minerals, color, tocopherols, moisture content, insoluble impurities, and water activity. Neither chitosan nor the activated earth adsorption process was effective in removing FFA from the salmon oil.

Air injection and water injection coupled with a Venturi ejector significantly increased the heat transfer coefficient between food and cooling water. For the investigated conditions, h \u00af was increased up to eight times, when air injection was used. However, the complex flow of bubbles and water inside the tank created heterogeneous water agitation, creating zones with different heat transfer coefficients.

The oxygen level at which respiration was half its maximum (apparent K m,O 2 ) was similar to or only slightly greater than the fermentation threshold. The narrow range of oxygen between K m,O 2 and the fermentation threshold, suggests that modified atmosphere packaging technology has a limited applicability toward extension of the shelf-life of fresh-cut \u2018Rocha\u2019 pear.",

     "abstract": "Application of computed tomography (CT) in meat science is based on the different X-ray attenuations that tissues of different density produce. Processed data generate images (tomograms) where different biological structures may be distinguished. CT is of special interest for the study of the meat curing processes since a high density of salt ions produce a marked increase of CT attenuation values. Therefore, salt diffusion and distribution can be easily followed throughout the process. In this study, prediction models for salt and water content in dry-cured ham have been developed, obtaining errors of prediction of 0.3% NaCl and 1.5% water. Fat content and drying level significantly affect the precision of salt and water content predictions. A certain underestimation of salt content in fatty samples was observed. CT and the developed predictive models may be useful in the meat industry as a tool for characterizing and optimizing salting processes.",

     "abstract": "Minced beef\u2013fat blends having different fat level (2%, 9% and 15%) and full meat-fat samples were ohmically cooked by different voltage gradients (20, 30 and 40\u00a0V/cm). Main factors affecting the electrical conductivity were the temperature and the composition of the blends. Although the effect of initial fat content on electrical conductivity was statistically significant, voltage gradient did not affect the electrical conductivity changes during cooking treatment (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The electrical conductivity of the samples increased with increasing temperature up to the critical initial cooking temperature (60\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C) depending on the fat level, and then decreased due to structural changes and the increase in the bound water during cooking. The results of the nonlinear mathematical model including the effects of initial fat level and the temperature on the electrical conductivity changes had good agreement (r\u00a0=\u00a00.952; SEM\u00a0=\u00a00.009) with the experimental data. The determination of electrical conductivity changes being affected by process variables is crucial to characterize the ohmic cooking of meat products and design of ohmic systems.",

For the sake of comparison, semolina dough rheological and mechanical properties and the relative size distribution of proteins were also determined.From rheological results it was inferred that the tenacity of amaranth, oat and quinoa dough samples was lower than that of semolina dough. The elastic modulus (Ec) of amaranth, oat and quinoa doughs was higher than that of semolina dough. Amaranth and quinoa G\u2032 was found to be similar and significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with respect to that of oat dough at a moisture of 30%. The G\u2033 of amaranth, quinoa and oat doughs showed different values. The highest G\u2033 value was recorded for the amaranth dough while the lowest one was shown by oat. For semolina dough, the G\u2032 and G\u2033 values were significantly lower than those of all the other dough samples. Moreover, at low and medium frequencies, tan\u00a0\u03b4 values of oat and quinoa doughs were statistically comparable and significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than that of amaranth and semolina doughs. At high frequencies, tan\u00a0\u03b4 values of investigated samples were different among them and the highest value was detected for amaranth, followed by semolina, quinoa and oat. Results of the size distribution of proteins in amaranth, quinoa, oat and semolina doughs were expressed as the proportion of \u201cunextractable polymeric protein\u201d (UPP).

Apparent viscosity decreased during storing time at low shear rates (<10\u00a0s\u22121) and above this value practically remained constant. At low shear rates, apparent viscosity keeps unchanged up to a period of 15\u00a0days for tragacanth gum and in guar gum systems decreased continuously up to 20\u00a0days. It was found that the Cross model described adequately the experimental data for both polymers. Evaluating time dependence of the viscometric parameters of the Cross model, it was possible to propose satisfactory equations which relate the apparent viscosity with the storage time.Oscillatory shear experiments showed a predominant viscous liquid behaviour up to crossover angular frequencies at 38.4 and 5.24\u00a0rad s\u22121 in fresh systems of tragacanth and guar gums, respectively. Storage and loss moduli decreased with time and it was observed in stored samples a shift of the crossover towards lower and higher frequencies for tragacanth and guar systems, respectively.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to determine the diffusion coefficient of moisture in the pores of banana foam mat using stochastic pore network. A 2-D pore network was used to represent the pore voids inside the banana foam sample and the moisture movement inside the individual pore segments was described by Fick\u2019s law. To determine the moisture diffusion coefficient, the adsorption experiments were carried out with standard static method using saturated salt solutions. Two banana foam densities of 0.21 and 0.26\u00a0g/cm3 were used to adsorb the water vapour. The interactions between moisture and pore structure were illustrated using a 3-D pictorial representation of network concentration gradients in spaces with colour representing the moisture content. The network model described the experimental results relatively well. The diffusion coefficient of moisture in pores was in order of 10 - 9 m2/s which was nine times higher than the effective diffusion coefficient calculated from the continuum model. The value of moisture diffusion coefficient was dependent on the temperature and independent of the foam densities and the relative humidity, except for the diffusivity determined from the condition at higher relative humidity of 70%.",

     "abstract": "In this contribution, a mathematical model is built to predict the changes in water concentration in both a solid food matrix and a fluid carrier during supercritical carbon dioxide (SC\u2013CO2) drying. The mass balance equations of the model involve five dimensionless parameters: Peclet number modified Sherwood number, Fourier number, mass ratio and equilibrium constant. The differential equations were discretized using the finite explicit difference method. The resulting model was implemented and solved in Matlab/Simulink using an explicit Runge\u2013Kutta solver. A very good agreement (ARD\u00a0=\u00a07.2%) between experimental data, obtained by an independent group, and the present model was observed. The axial dispersion diffusion coefficient seems not to play a significant role during the drying process. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predictions are relatively more sensitive to the equilibrium constant and the mass ratio than to Peclet and modified Sherwood numbers. Furthermore, in the case of Peclet and modified Sherwood numbers, the sensitivity and the uncertainty of the output are function of the final moisture content. The present model could be used as an optimization tool for kinetic studies to investigate the effects of different operation conditions on the performance and design of the supercritical drying technology.",

In the current study, a novel approach was applied using high magnification imaging to develop surface texture features and an alternative colour space greyscale to express muscle surface texture. An automatic segmentation method was applied to develop colour and marbling features and best regression model subsets were selected automatically with genetic algorithms. Results indicated that accurate modelling of beef acceptability with regression models was possible with r2 up to 0.95. Modelling of acceptability using high magnification images proved more successful than modelling with low magnification images. Linear models performed well compared to non-linear models. Other sensory measurements particularly TPA hardness were more difficult to model, although an accurate model of juiciness was developed. Addition of non-linear terms did not give large improvements except for juiciness.",
