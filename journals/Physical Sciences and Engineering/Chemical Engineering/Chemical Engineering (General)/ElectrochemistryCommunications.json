     "abstract": "Although often overlooked, current collectors play a significant role in the performance, safety, and stability of lithium batteries. Here we present a strategy to modify conventional Al current collectors using a conducting polymer, significantly decreasing contact resistance and improving battery performance. The oxidant Fe (III) p-toluenesulfonate is aerosolized onto an aluminum foil current collector, followed by polymerization of 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). As such, this fabrication technique should scalable using roll-to-roll or similar fabrication methods. The coated foil was used as a cathode current collector in lithium batteries. The improvement of the current collector is determined by electrochemical test in coin cells with C-LiFePO4 (C-LFP) and lithium as active materials. At 15C discharge rate, the new composite C-LFP-PEDOT-Al electrode provides a ~30% increase in discharge capacity compared to the standard C-LFP-Al electrode. The new composite has a perfect stability over 50\u202fcycles at a C/2.5 rate.",

Little is, however, known about the electrochemical behaviour of hydrogen-bearing arylsilanes.

The oxidation potentials are found to depend on both the nature and number of the aryl groups. Based on these findings it was possible to establish some variation trends that match the expected structure\u2013property correlations. Furthermore, we present first insights into the electrochemical reaction kinetics behind and identify several soluble electrochemical oxidation products.",

Despite recent progress, no architecture has been shown to be suitable for practical applications, due to some major problems at the device level. The complicated structure of these prototype devices and their complex electrode materials reduce their practicability and make it difficult to achieve the aim of chameleon-like camouflage capabilities. Here, we use a laterally-configured electrode structure and inexpensive and commercially available ITO film as electrodes to construct an electrochromic (EC) fabric via an all-solution process. This novel EC fabric exhibits camouflage EC performance by changing colour between vegetable-green and soil-brown; it is also practical for camouflage applications due to its excellent flexibility and stability as well as being thin and lightweight. Moreover, this strategy can also be used to fabricate flexible transparent EC devices on plastics and \u201cchameleon camouflage\u201d on human skin. This approach is simple to configure and easy to operate, and has potential for the development of EC device systems that can change colour in camouflage applications.",

In this study we present self-contained gelled thermogalvanic cells (or thermocells) containing the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox couple, which additionally have gold nanoparticles either immobilised at the gel/electrode interface, or distributed throughout the entire gel. Both methods of introducing the gold nanoparticles result in an apparent electrocatalytic improvement, as demonstrated by significant decreases in the electron transfer resistance. However, when used as thermogalvanic cells, only minor improvements were observed in power generation, and relatively rapid dissolution of the gold nanoparticles was observed, to yield passivating gold analogues of Prussian blue. Therefore successful preparation and short-term improvements have been demonstrated, but are offset by long-term stability issues.

The application of local electrochemical techniques such as scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has opened new possibilities for the detection of corrosion products and activity on metallic surfaces. However, due to its stochastic nature, the analysis of pitting corrosion requires being at the right place at the right time. Scanning over large areas at a high resolution not only leads to long scan durations but also leaves many short-lived processes undetected. In this paper we present the combined automated operation of SECM and wire multi-electrodes connected to a multi-electrode analyzer (MMA). The inter-electrode currents between 25 wire electrodes connected via zero resistance ammeters (ZRA) are measured by the MMA at open circuit potential (OCP) and the electrodes reporting anodic currents are detected automatically to be analyzed by means of SECM. The results demonstrate the successful application of this methodology for the detection of unstable and stable pitting processes on 304 stainless steel in a corrosive aqueous environment.",

It was observed that different crystal facets of SS-fcc and SS-bcc disappear at different rates during anodization.

The influence of plastic feedstock and synthesis temperature on the performance of plastic-derived CNTs as electrode materials in electrocatalysis was investigated. The CNTs were evaluated as electrode materials for their heterogeneous electron transfer rate using a redox probe, which showed improved electrochemical behaviour. For oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CNTs produced at 500\u202f\u00b0C demonstrated superior performance compared to those produced at 800\u202f\u00b0C. Influence of feedstock on electrocatalytic ORR activity of the as synthesised CNTs was marginal. Temperature was the governing factor influencing the properties of CNTs due to annealing and oxidation of edge defects generated during synthesis at higher temperatures.",

Calculations of the HOMO-LUMO energy gap for the ECL reaction indicated that isoquinoline is more likely to produce an excited state radical ion than quinoline. The effects of different functional groups on the ECL of isoquinoline were then compared and a possible ECL reaction mechanism was discussed.

Using the PEC-Cl process, the efficiency of decomplexation improved in the presence of a high concentration of Cl\u2212. However, when the concentration of Cl\u2212 exceeded 20\u202fmM, the deposited Cu could be oxidized to copper compounds by free chlorine (Cl2, HOCl, Cl and OCl), resulting in a decline in Cu recovery. The total nitrogen removal increased from 7.9% (PEC without Cl\u2212) to 95.6% for the PEC-Cl process, which can be attributed to the generation of chlorine radicals (OCl and/or Cl). A mechanism for Cu\u2013cyanide decomplexation and Cu recovery during the PEC-Cl process is proposed. Cu\u2013cyanide complexes are destroyed by free chlorine, generating CNO\u2212 and Cu2+.

The effect of ultrasonic vibration on the anodic oxidation rate of a 4H-SiC (0001) surface was studied, and it was confirmed that ultrasonic vibration significantly enhanced the anodic oxidation of SiC. Compared with conventional anodic oxidation, the oxidation rate increased by about 34% with ultrasonic assistance (UA) in the initial oxidation stage, and by about 11% during subsequent anodic oxidation. In addition, the oxidation can be promoted continuously with increasing oxidation time owing to the porous structure of the oxide layer. UAECMP is very promising as an efficient finishing technique for SiC surfaces.",

In the presence of Brij L23, the fractional current efficiency is much improved and approaches 1.0 while maintaining a fractional selectivity of 0.99 at a very high conversion in a single pass. The improvement in current efficiency is ascribed to a decrease in the bubble size of the H2 gas evolved at the counter electrode leading to an enhancement in the mass transport regime in the flow stream through the extended channel with millimetre dimensions.",

     "abstract": "The boundary conditions proposed to discuss the charge exchange taking place in an ionic liquid in contact with non-blocking electrodes are reconsidered in a dynamic situation. Assuming that the variation of the bulk ionic current density depends linearly on the surface value of the ionic current density, the frequency dependence of the phenomenological parameter is determined. The analysis has been performed in the framework where the relaxation times are smaller than a maximum relaxation time \u03c4M, and that the response function is independent on the value of the relaxation time. Using simple physical considerations, an expression for the surface conductivity describing the ionic charge exchange at the electrode is obtained. According to our calculations, its frequency dependence is similar to that predicted for the electric conductivity in disordered materials when the mechanism is of the hopping type. From measurements of impedance spectroscopy, by the best fit of the experimental data, the temperature dependence of the hopping time, of the dc surface conductivity, and of the diffusion coefficient are derived. They are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions obtained with the random distribution of surface energy barrier.",

It was recently reported that the cathodic process in this transformation is controlled by the sluggish diffusion of the generated O2\u2212 ions. The formation of Li2O on the cathode results in partial cathodic passivation of the cathode. To accelerate the reaction kinetics and also eliminate the concentration polarization of the resulting Li2O, the effect of bubbling CO2 through a hollow electrode was examined in this work using a home-made hollow gas bubbling (HGB) electrode. The localised CO2 bubbling not only accelerates the transport of O2\u2212 ions by agitating the electrolyte nearby, but the CO2 also reacts with Li2O to form the more soluble Li2CO3. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and constant current electrolysis were conducted in the melt at 723\u202fK to study the depolarization mechanisms involved in the CO2 bubbling reaction. Using the HGB electrode, the steady-state current density increased from 15.3\u202fmA/cm2 to ~200\u202fmA/cm2 at a potential of \u22122.4\u202fV (vs. Ag/Ag2SO4).

The GACSS cathode supports simultaneous H2O2 electrogeneration via the in situ supplied O2 from Ti/MMO anode and the subsequent H2O2 activation for OH generation, thus enabling the cracking of dye molecules adsorbed on GAC and regenerating the GAC's sorption capacity.

     "abstract": "In this study, a label-free sensing method based on a functionalized nanopipette is proposed for detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. This method is based on the unique charge transport properties of nanopores in which the ionic current can be modulated by variation in the charge on the inner surface of the nanopipette. A phosphorylated peptide, O-phospho-l-tyrosine (p-Tyr), was used as a model substrate and to functionalize the nanopipette. The covalent functionalization procedures were characterized by measuring the current-voltage (IV) curves and extracting the ionic current rectification status. On ALP catalysis, the removal of the p-Tyr phosphate group induces a decrease in the negative surface charge, subsequently leading to a sensitive response in the ionic current change. An ANOVA test confirmed a linear relationship between the normalized ionic current change and ALP activity. The functionalized nanopipettes demonstrated a directly measured detection limit of 0.1\u202fmU/mL, and excellent selectivity against four common interfering proteins. Furthermore, this nanopore-based method has potential for use in characterizing or sensing the activities of other enzymes with a similar biochemical process to ALP.",

Specifically, concurrently with a Co-to-P ratio increase from 1.6 to 1.9, the current density for OER increases from 1.77\u202fmA/cm2 at 1.8\u202fV vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) to 2.89\u202fmA/cm2 at 1.8\u202fV vs. RHE. Moreover the sample with a Co-to-P ratio of 1.9 has superior performance when compared to electrodeposited cobalt phosphate thin films reported in the literature.",

Moreover, it is well known that the oxide forms of platinum and gold are not stable under electrolysis conditions. In this study, an easy and scalable method is introduced to protect the titanium PTL from passivation by sputtering very thin layers of iridium onto commercially-available titanium PTLs. The iridium layer reduces the overall ohmic resistance of the PTL/catalyst layer interface and improves the cell's performance to that achieved with carbon-based PTLs.

Compared with a conventional \u201csubmerged\u201d cathode, the H2O2 concentration obtained using the \u201cfloating\u201d cathode is 4.3 and 1.5 times higher using porous graphite felt (GF) and reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foam electrodes, respectively. This surprising enhancement results from the formation of a three-phase interface inside the porous cathode, where the O2 from ambient air is also utilized for H2O2 production. The contribution of O2 from ambient air varies depending on the cathode material and is calculated to be 76.7% for the GF cathode and 35.6% for the RVC foam cathode.

One route to enhancing radiation resistance is to introduce a high density of defect sinks such as grain boundaries. However, there are still important questions regarding the role of grain boundaries in enhancing radiation tolerance, particularly in ionic materials. Experiments have found large improvements in the amorphization resistance of oxides at temperatures where defect mobilities are too low to easily reach the boundaries. Standard reaction-diffusion models are inadequate in explaining this behavior. Here, we examine the role of electro-migration in the overall transport of irradiation-induced defects in ionic systems. We find that electro-migration can have a large impact on the steady state point defect concentrations as compared to models that do not include the effect of electro-migration. In particular, defect concentrations can change by nearly seven orders of magnitude for certain conditions. We conclude that radiation tolerance in nanocrystalline ionic ceramics will be driven both by enhanced sink density via small grain sizes and, critically, the effects of electro-migration induced by charge segregation to grain boundaries.",

The latter is explained by the formation of aqueous tungsten complexes with the electrolyte that are thermodynamically more stable than WO3. As can be anticipated from these initial results, the novel method will enable the characterization of a wide range of photoelectrochemical materials, and thus eventually lead to the development of long-term stable devices.",

This work evaluates electrochemical biofilm dispersion kinetics from boron-doped diamond (BDD) surfaces in situ using optical coherence tomography microscopy to track the volume of biofilm (biovolume) on the electrode. After starting with a 75\u202f\u03bcm thick biofilm, applying 50\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122 results in near complete biofilm removal after 60\u202fmin, with a pseudo first-order biovolume removal rate of 0.023\u202fmin\u22121; higher applied currents had negligible additional benefits. Thus, it appears plausible to attain biofouling mitigation through electrochemical self-cleaning of BDD electrodes, potentially via the following two-step process: 1) hydroxyl radical production on the electrode surface which oxidizes polysaccharides or other cellular materials that attach bacteria to surface, followed by 2) gas evolution on the electrode surface (beneath the biofilm), which pushes and sloughs off the biofilm. This novel approach to biofouling management can find applications in electrochemical water treatment and other important surfaces (e.g., electrodes, membrane spacers, heat exchange surfaces, interior pipe surfaces, etc.) in water treatment systems where biofilms develop and harbor microbial pathogens.",

Graphene oxide is then added to the surface by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking with the aptamer. The negative charge of the nanochannels is increased by the introduction of the negatively charged graphene oxide and the aptamer, which also cause steric hindrance. On the addition of aflatoxin B1, graphene oxide is detached from the surface of the nanochannels due to the specific binding of aflatoxin B1 to the aptamer. The flux of Fe(CN)63\u2212 through the nanochannels is increased because the charge density and steric hindrance are reduced, resulting in an increased current response. The increase in current is proportional to the concentration of aflatoxin B1. The detection limit of the proposed biosensor is about 0.13\u202fng/mL and the linear range is 1\u201320\u202fng/mL.

     "abstract": "One major challenge associated with proton exchange membrane fuel cells is to preserve higher proton conductivity under low-humidity atmosphere. Elevation of water uptake in the perfluorinated polymeric membrane is crucial for the facilitated transportation of proton, which dominates the fuel cell performance. Development of an intrinsic mechanism that controls water balance through the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), eliminates the need for external water management system and thus makes the system suitable for portable applications, where size is an important criterion to be considered. Herein, we report a nano-sized dense-structure (NSDS) layer coated onto the conventional catalyst layer, forming a dual-layered electrode architecture that is favorable in promoting the self-humidification process. This self-humidifying layer is fabricated by the electrostatic spray deposition with sufficiently low deposition rate, which allows for a creation of more uniformly distributed porous structure with diameters smaller than 80\u202fnm, enabling recirculation of the water generated for proper humidification. When experimentally investigated, the MEA employing the dual-layered electrode reveals a 3.15 times elevated current density at 0.6\u202fV than conventional MEA under 0% relative humidity. Mechanism for the water retention in the proposed electrode is further evaluated by X-ray computed tomography, which reveals dramatically increased tortuosity of 4.43 for the NSDS layer in comparison to 1.9 for the conventional catalyst layer.",

     "abstract": "The in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for water treatment is more practical than the use of liquid H2O2, which is costly to store and transport. Calcium peroxide (CaO2), a solid carrier of H2O2, can release H2O2 on dissolution in water. However, the constant H2O2 release rate of CaO2 has been a bottleneck constraining its wider application. In this study, a practical electrochemical method using a divided cell is developed to control the rate of release of H2O2 from CaO2. The results show that the rate of H2O2 release from CaO2 is enhanced in the anolyte. The increase in H2O2 release is positively correlated with the current. Under a current of 100\u202fmA, the H2O2 concentration was 2.5 times higher after 30\u202fmin of electrolysis than in the control experiment in which no current was applied. Water electrolysis in the anodic compartment generates protons that not only: (i) enhance dissolution of CaO2 and release of H2O2, but also (ii) neutralize the alkaline pH resulting from CaO2 dissolution, thus providing new advantages for the use of CaO2. This effective technique may be suitable for the sophisticated control of H2O2 release in environmental applications.",

The increase of the mass in the protein layer is expected to be the cause. However, we encountered severe inconsistencies for these assumptions. In our experiments during the development of an immunosensor, proteins with diverse charges were immobilised and captured on the electrode surface. The measured values of impedance were predominantly affected by the charge of these proteins - negatively charged proteins caused (an expected) increase of the impedance values. Contrary, immobilization/capture of positively charged proteins and other compounds caused (a surprising) relative decrease of the impedance. The obvious and logical origin of this behaviour \u2013 a repulsive or attractive ionic interactions between protein layers and negatively charged redox probe [Fe(CN)6]4\u2212/3\u2212 (commonly used in electrochemistry) \u2013 is usually neglected throughout the literature although some fragmental information could be traced.

For telomerase activity sensing, a telomerase substrate (TS) primer is anchored on the surface of magnetic beads (MBs). Under telomerase catalysis, the TS primer is extended to generate longer G-rich single strand DNA, which can bind with hemin to form G-quadruplex/hemin complexes. Based on this mechanism, the resulting MBs are used to capture hemin molecules in electrolyte solution and reduce their concentration. Since hemin acts as electron acceptor for a p-CuBi2O4 nanorod-based photocathode, a decrease in hemin concentration will lead to a decreasing photocurrent signal. By recording the decay of the photocurrent, the telomerase activity can be monitored with high sensitivity. Under optimal conditions, the developed sensor allows measurement of telomerase activity in cell extracts over the range 100\u20132000 HeLa cells with the limit of detection (LOD) as low as 53 cells (S/N\u202f=\u202f3).

The investigation is based on a thermodynamic mixture theory which explicitly accounts for the solvation effect.

A subsequent investigation of the electrolytic space charge layer shows that a saturated solution of 1\u202fmol\u202fL\u22121 solvated ions forms near the electrode, and we point out some fundamental similarities of this state to a saturated bulk solution. This finding challenges the assumption of complete dissociation, even for moderate electrolyte concentrations, whereby we introduce an undissociated ion-pair in solution. We re-derive the equilibrium conditions for a two-step dissociation reaction, including solvation effects, which leads to a new relation to determine the dissociation degree. A comparison to Ostwald's dilution law clearly shows the shortcomings when solvation effects are neglected and we emphasize that complete dissociation is questionable beyond 0.5\u202fmol\u202fL\u22121 for aqueous, mono-valent electrolytes.",

Cyt c4 has shown direct electron transfer (DET) with both hemes in electrical communication with two different electrode materials (ITO and Au) and on the basis of cyt c4-multilayer electrodes \u201cself-exchange\u201d properties can also be deduced. Investigation of cyt c4 in combination with PSI within an inverse opal ITO electrode has shown the dihemic protein to be a valuable molecular electron conduit, able to interconnect the photoenzymatic reaction with the 3D electrode. The properties have been compared with those of electrodes based on monohemic cyt c derived from horse heart.",

The fading depolarization phenomenon is a critical reason for the void formation under the high current density plating condition although employing higher current densities to shorten the plating time for copper damascene process is the objective to push forward. Consequently, the polarizing species suppressing the deposition rate at the corner and sidewall of the vias should be strong enough to prevent copper from growing too fast, and the concentration of depolarizing additives may also need to increase to promote the growth rate at the bottom. Careful reconsideration of additives should be done to achieve the void-free filling at high current density electrodeposition.",

The resulting PdNP@N-CNTs nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical experiments show that the nanocomposite has high electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution with a current density of 32\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122 at an overpotential of 100\u202fmV and a low Tafel slope (33\u202fmV/dec) with excellent stability. The high catalytic activity and durability were considered to be due to N atoms incorporated into the carbon skeleton forming numerous active sites for the deposition of small and uniformly distributed Pd nanoparticles.

At potentials negative of about \u22120.8\u202fV vs. Pd/H, reduction of the PIL cations occurs, liberating H2.

In contrast, electrooxidation of water in the PIL occurs at different potentials in the PIL as the electrode composition changes.

Two approaches were taken: delayed sample quenching with methanol, and application of intermittent current supply. For samples electrooxidized in Na2SO4 anolyte for 10\u201315\u202fmin, a delay of 60\u202fmin in sample quenching yielded an additional diatrizoate removal of 53%. This impact of sample quenching delay was observed at both pH\u202f2 and pH\u202f7, indicating that the source of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals was present at both pH values. Intermittent current supply (cycles of 5\u202fmin ON/15\u202fmin OFF) enabled a saving in electrical energy consumption by ~35% compared to constant current, due to continued removal of diatrizoate during the OFF periods. Electrooxidation in NaNO3 anolyte did not show any off-grid oxidation of diatrizoate, confirming the crucial role of electrochemically activated sulfate.

This phenomenon suggests that the specific capacitance is strain-dependent, and tensile strain decreases the specific capacitance of carbon cloth.

Here, phenylenediamine-based Fe/N/C catalysts modified with CeO2 were synthesized by a hydrothermal method to eliminate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thereby improving the durability/stability of the catalyst. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and catalytic durability/stability were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry and accelerated durability tests (ADTs). The results show that the yield of H2O2 evaluated by rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurement decreased obviously when the CeO2 mass ratio in catalyst is optimal. The loss of current density at 0.8\u202fV of catalyst with 6\u202fwt% CeO2 and catalyst without CeO2 were 51.1% and 91.5%, respectively. The addition of CeO2 can improve the durability/stability of Fe/N/C catalysts obviously due to the elimination of H2O2 during ORR.",

Recent studies suggest that electric field-induced anion incorporation in the oxide may generate compressive surface stress that drives oxide flow responsible for formation of self-ordered arrays of pores. This communication reports direct evidence for sulfate ion incorporation-induced compressive stress in native aluminum oxide films from stress measurements during open-circuit Al dissolution in 0.4\u202fM H2SO4, coupled with analysis of the film composition by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The measured force per width (integrated in-plane stress) was compared to the calculated elastic force assuming that all detected sulfate ions are incorporated in the oxide, rather than adsorbed on the oxide surface. Quantitative agreement was demonstrated between the calculated and experimental force, showing that sulfate incorporation dominates over adsorption and induces greater than 1\u202fGPa levels of compressive stress in the oxide. The present work and an earlier study of phosphate incorporation show that anions incorporate at small open-circuit exposure times, when the outer portion of the oxide can support a high electric field because it is not yet completely hydrated. Therefore the electric field in the oxide is the likely driving force for incorporation.",

The reaction always proceeds in a potential window that is almost pH independent, regardless of changes in the presence of adsorbed species. Comparison with other available information for these interphases allows to conclude that this reaction is very sensitive to the free charge on the metal, being inhibited when the latter is negative. This explains the complete current inhibition when the potential is lower than the potential of zero free charge. Most remarkably, the inhibition at high potentials can be related to the existence of a second potential of zero charge, above which the surface becomes again negatively charged. This conclusion agrees with classical results for polycrystalline platinum (which has been reexamined), results from laser induced T-jump experiments and recent theoretical models of the interphase. In this way, this reaction is postulated as a new probe to locate the values of the potential of zero free charge.",

Addition of monoethanolamine (MEA) to [C3OHmim]BF4 significantly increases the H2S absorption capacity through the chemical reaction between MEA and H2S. This chemical absorption enhances the electrochemical response of H2S, in particular generating electroactive HS\u2212 ions that lead to an additional and independent anodic peak at around \u2212\u00a00.4\u00a0V vs Ag/Ag+ which is suitable for H2S sensing.

In this study, we develop a new activation process by which aliphatic NH2-SAMs immobilize Ni particles on low-k (SiOCH) dielectric layers, and which involves a cost-effective basic aqueous solution simply containing Ni2\u00a0+ ions. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy suggests that the activated SAMs work effectively as diffusion barriers, enabling integration of Cu with SiOCH without interposing a conventional barrier layer. Moreover, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy, the sizes of the Ni particles adsorbed are extremely small (2\u20133\u00a0nm), leading to fast nucleation and the formation of void/seam-free Cu interconnects in 60-nm trenches. Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a new model of changes in the surface structure (and the phase transitions of the seeds) leading to effective seeding is proposed.",

MS and IS are usually measured in aqueous solutions.

The experimentally observed dependence of the maximal current density, jmax, on the inverse disc radius, 1/r0, for electrodes of larger sizes approaches a straight line corresponding to the \u201cstrong current limit\u201d, which exceeds the diffusion-limited current density for bromate ion.",

Here, terminated nanotubes with sealed bottoms were discovered while titanium foils were anodized under different conditions. In one terminated nanotube, oxide at the bottom does not grow whereas dissolution from electrolyte still exists. According to the estimated dissolution rate, it only takes approximately 20\u00a0s for the bottom of the terminated nanotube to be penetrated absolutely based on dissolution equilibrium theory. Apparently, most anodizations in this work all last for more than 20\u00a0s after the appearance of terminated nanotubes.

     "abstract": "Utilization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in fabrication of electrodes for electrochemical detection often faces a conflicting goal: achieving both high response current and high mass transfer coefficient. Typically, electrodes made in a form of CNT ensembles offer high response current as a result of the large number of CNTs. However, these electrodes have substantially low mass transfer coefficients due to overlapping of diffusion fields between neighboring CNTs. To resolve this conflict, we design band electrodes made of vertically-aligned CNT (CNBEs), which are macro-sized in length and submicro-sized in width. We show that the distinct dimensions of the CNBEs allow both high response currents and mass transfer coefficients. We also demonstrate that CNBEs offer excellent detection performances including wide linear range, high sensitivity, and low limit of detection in channel flow voltammetry.",

It has been found that the diminution of the activity on Pt(111) occurs at the same potential value in the SHE scale for the different pH values.

On the other hand, recent investigations have revealed that considering the volumetric charge and finite permittivity of the rigid core results in more realistic descriptions of the electrostatics of biological particles. Here, the simultaneous impact of ion partitioning and core volumetric charge on the electrostatics of spherical soft particles is studied using theoretical methods. The equations governing the general case are solved numerically, and analytical expressions are also derived using the Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel linearization, which are found to be accurate even in the presence of large core charges. It is observed that, whenever there is a difference between the permittivities of two neighboring media, there is a noticeable change in the slope of the electrostatic potential profile at the interface, with the result that the electrostatic potential distribution of the system deviates from literature predictions. Based on these findings, it is strongly recommended to take the effect of ion partitioning into account when studying the electrostatics of soft particles, especially in the case of low-shell permittivity and concentrated electrolytes.",

The actively dissolving anodes have been shown experimentally to be the primary source of anomalous evolution of hydrogen. In this model, standard electrochemical laws are used to account for this phenomenon. The fractional coverage of active Mg sites is introduced to localize the cathodic contribution of HE during anodic polarization. A kinetic equation is derived showing that the rate of HE will increase with increasing potential if the charge transfer coefficient associated with the Mg oxidation reaction is greater than the charge transfer coefficient for the HE reaction. Experimental data obtained on high purity Mg galvanodynamically polarized at potentials above and below its Ecorr in 0.1\u00a0M NaCl solution are presented to validate the model.",

     "abstract": "A novel catalyst design for electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC) is proposed which overcomes the main bottlenecks that limit EPOC commercialization, i.e., the low dispersion and small surface area of metal catalysts. We have increased the surface area by using a porous composite electrode backbone made of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-\u03b4/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (LSM/GDC). Highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 6.5\u00a0nm have been deposited on LSM/GDC by atomic layer deposition (ALD). This novel design offers, for the first time, a controllable and reproducible method for the fabrication of EPOC catalysts. The bare electrode backbone shows negligible activity for propane oxidation, while in the presence of Pt nanoparticles a high catalytic activity is obtained above 200\u00a0\u00b0C. The performance of the Pt-loaded LSM/GDC catalyst was significantly improved by application of small currents (I\u00a0<\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bc\u0391), leading to a 27\u201333% increase as a function of the open circuit catalytic rate, with apparent Faradaic efficiency values ranging from 1000 to 3860% at 300\u00a0\u00b0C. Our results demonstrate that EPOC is a valid approach for enhancing the catalytic activity of nano-structured catalysts.",

It performs outstandingly well as a photoanode because it possesses the advantages of both arrays and nanoparticles. This CdS film is prepared simply by a combination of reaction and assembly at the gas/liquid interface (RAG/L) with successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), requiring no templates or expensive equipment. In this approach, the nanopores in the film of loosely aggregated CdS nanoparticles produced by RAG/L are filled by CdS nanoparticles via SILAR, forming a compact CdS film. Network micro-cracks form in the compact CdS film due to calcination caused by differential thermal expansion compared with the substrate, and these cut the CdS film into irregular micro-block arrays. This micro-/nano-structure in the prepared CdS film improves its capacity for visible light absorption, facilitates the generation/separation of excited charges, and enhances mass transfer.

The transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed high dispersion of WPA on GO matrix, while the surface analysis showed thermal activation of structural changes of WPA and desorption of oxygen functional groups from GO and GO/WPA nanocomposite. Initial GO/WPA nanocomposite had approximately two times higher capacitance compared to initial GO. The thermal treatment of initial GO and GO/WPA to 500\u00a0\u00b0C induced twofold increase of capacitance of GO and 40% increase of GO/WPA, accompanied with significant increase of operating voltage compared to GO (for 300\u00a0mV). Above 500\u00a0\u00b0C, a decrease of capacitance of both GO and GO/WPA was observed. The results suggest that understanding of structural changes of components and their interaction is crucial for improvement of electrochemical properties of considered composite.",

This is a direct evidence of migration of the acid anions via the vehicle conducting mechanism, resulting in an accumulation of acid at the anode side and depletion at the cathode side. Both resistances reach a steady state value after a prolonged period of measurement, apparently balanced by the back diffusion of the acid molecules. The phenomenon is magnified at higher current densities and with increased thickness of the overall membrane, which is of significance in quantitative understanding of the proton conductivity mechanism e.g. for determination of the anionic transference number.

In addition, products of irreversible oxidation/reduction of the parent bases are shown to yield analytically useful, base-specific cathodic/anodic signals, making it possible to distinguish between the canonical bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine), uracil (U) and 5-methylcytosine (mC) in DNA. Furthermore, selective electrochemical \u201cswitching off\u201d of the redox signals specific to certain nucleobases is presented as a way to resolve overlapping signals. Similarly, newly reported signals corresponding to electrochemically transformed bases can be \u201cswitched on\u201d under specific conditions. This approach can be utilized for fast and facile simultaneous label-free analysis of bases in DNA, including mC and U, and to uncover overlapping signals. This significantly extends the possible applications of PGE in DNA research and (bio)sensor development.",

The calculated results uncover that, in addition to the traditional NiN catalytic site, the H atoms directly bonded to the N atoms can also act as the active site for ORR, with the activity even higher than that of NiN moiety. The relative energy diagrams show that the favorable ORR pathway on all possible active sites is the two-electron reduction mechanism from O2 to H2O2, which is well consistent with the experimental observations.

     "abstract": "Oxygen permeation in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers is a critical phenomenon. Mainly, because of (i) degradation and (ii) purity of the hydrogen product gas. Additionally, but less important because of (iii) efficiency loss and (iv) safety problems. Despite these issues, oxygen permeation in PEM water electrolysis was paid less attention. This can be explained by the low oxygen crossover compared to the hydrogen crossover. In this contribution the oxygen content within the hydrogen product gas was measured for two different cathodic catalyst materials (Pt and a Pt-free catalyst) during water electrolysis in a current density range of 0.05\u20132 A/cm2. In comparison to the platinum catalyst, the Pt-free catalyst leads to 3\u20134 times higher oxygen contents within the hydrogen product gas. This can be explained with a lower activity concerning oxygen recombination, so that less permeated oxygen is consumed and consequently, the oxygen flux within hydrogen is higher.The results of this work emphasize that the oxygen crossover increases with increasing current density, as like the hydrogen crossover does. Particularly, two effects are possible for this strong increase in oxygen permeation: supersaturation and the electro-osmotic drag. The experimental findings show that the crossover is higher as generally expected, and should receive more attention.",

The strongly acidic nature of Nafion\u00ae is not always desirable; for instance, CO2 electroreduction requires a low proton activity to avoid excess hydrogen evolution. This communication presents a novel measurement technique for determining the acidity of a PEM, using a pH-sensitive electrode half-cell attached to the membrane sample, connected to a reference electrode via a salt bridge. A dynamic hydrogen electrode on platinized\u2011platinum surface (DHE) was found to give repeatable results within 5% uncertainty. Several membranes based on Nafion\u00ae impregnated with various basic species were tested, as well as an anion-exchange membrane and a poly-phosphonic acid membrane. The technique is expected to have wider reaching applications in PEM fuel cell and redox flow battery development, as well as in the electrolysis and electrodialysis industries.",

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a non-destructive, ultrasensitive fingerprint technique that can detect metal\u2013adsorbate and metal oxide vibrations. However, it is hard to study nanocatalysts because of the morphology limitation of SERS. In this paper, core-shell-satellite nanostructures have been fabricated by assembling PtFe nanocatalysts on shell-isolated nanoparticles (SHINs). CO electrooxidation on these nanostructures was studied by in situ electrochemical shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SHINERS). The in situ spectroscopic results correlate well with the results obtained using cyclic voltammetry, and show that PtFe bimetallic nanocatalysts have improved CO electrooxidation activity. The in situ SHINERS studies also show that this improvement is the result of weaker CO adsorption on PtFe compared to Pt, as revealed by the red shift of the Raman band of the PtC stretching vibration on PtFe. This work demonstrates that this method is a powerful tool for in situ investigation of the electrocatalytic processes occurring on nanocatalysts and provides a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms.",

From these experiments, we conclude that the non-conventional mode produces higher peak currents and displacement of the peak potentials, yielding lower overpotentials. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain more selective voltammograms in the non-conventional mode, showing peaks that could not be resolved in the conventional mode.These results are due to a change in the mass transport regime, with thin layer diffusion being the main transport method in the non-conventional mode, compared to semi-infinite diffusion in the conventional mode.The proposed approach is an excellent alternative for performing voltammetric studies on insoluble or slightly soluble organic compounds.",

Taking advantage of the physicochemical properties of graphene nanosheets and gold nanoparticles, the mass transport regime of nitrite at the paper-based electrode was thin layer diffusion rather than planar diffusion. In comparison with the electrochemical responses of commercial gold electrodes and glassy carbon electrodes (GCE), a considerably larger current signal was seen at the paper-based sensing interface, which significantly improved its sensitivity for nitrite detection. In particular, the paper-based electrode was a disposable sensing device, so that it effectively avoided the fouling effect arising from the adsorption of oxidation products.

This can be mitigated by selection of electrode materials with beneficial surface morphologies and/or compositions. We employ cyclic voltammetry to assess the redox current generated by clozapine, and differentiate solely surface-area-based effects from clozapine-specific ones using a standard redox couple. We find that nano- and microstructured platinum greatly amplifies the clozapine signal compared to gold (up to 1490-fold for platinum black). However, the material performs poorly in the presence of chloride ions, and RCS modification provides no further amplification. The RCS combined with atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) TiN, on the other hand, increases the signal by 7.54 times, versus 2.86 times for RCS on gold, with a 9.2-fold lower variability, indicating that the homogenous and chemically inert properties of ALD-TiN may make it an ideal electrode material.",

All of the electrical charge required to change the color of the electrochromic material is supplied by the photoelectrochemical reaction powered by visible light, so no conventional energy source is required. The proposed system consists of hematite modified with nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) as the photoanode, and Prussian blue deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode as the electrochromic cathode. Under illumination, photo-oxidation of glucose at the photoanode is followed by reduction of Prussian blue to Prussian white at the cathode.

In this study we show that a change in the activity of interfering ions can result in a short-term electrode potential transient that should be taken into consideration in parameter setting for SECM measurements. The activity step method was employed, using NH4+-ion-measuring micropipettes. Solutions containing equal concentrations of NH4+ ions with or without K+ ions were rapidly introduced and the short-term change in electrode potential was recorded. Rapid transient potential signals appeared following the K+ activity step in the range where the interfering K+ did not affect the long-term electrode potential.

The total signal from the working electrodes is converted to a three-digit binary number that specifies the presence or absence of the analyte at each position.

These electrolytes could potentially find application in other electrochemical systems. Therefore, it is relevant to investigate the electrochemical behavior of common electrode materials such as platinum, gold and glassy carbon in these electrolytes. Preliminary cyclic voltammetry results revealed that the electrochemical stability window of the electrodes increased by about 0.5\u00a0V for platinum and gold and 1\u00a0V for glassy carbon when the lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) concentration is increased from 1 to 5\u00a0M (mol/L). This increase is mainly due to the shift of the oxygen evolution potential to a more positive value in the more concentrated solution. In the latter, the H2O/Li+ molar ratio of 2.6 is insufficient for full solvation of Li+ cations. The positively charged electrode is therefore compensated mainly by TFSI\u2212 anions because the electrolyte contains a negligible amount of free water molecules, leading to an enhancement of the oxidative stability of the electrolyte.",

     "abstract": "We report on Faradaic reactions producing H+ (anode) and OH\u2013 (cathode) in flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) operated at 1.2\u00a0V. These reactions underline an additional electrodialytical desalination mechanism within capacitive deionization, which proceeds in parallel to the known electrosorption mechanism. Examination of flow-electrodes (100\u00a0ml each, 5% (wt) activated carbon) during FCDI (121\u00a0cm2 effective membrane area) of 150\u00a0ml, 4\u00a0g/l NaCl solution revealed that significant amounts of Na+ and Cl\u2212 ions (up to 50% and 30% of Cl\u2212 and Na+, respectively) were not adsorbed in the activated carbon particles but were rather dissolved in the aqueous phase of the flow-electrodes. Production of acid (resulting in pH\u00a0\u2248\u00a01.5) and base (pH\u00a0\u2248\u00a012.5) in the flow-anode and -cathode solutions was observed during the operation. Reverse pH behaviors were obtained during the regeneration of the flow-electrodes by potential reversal. pH neutralization of the flow-electrode solutions resulted in a sharp increase in both the desalination rate and the electric current of the FCDI cell. Reacting NaOH and HCl in a short-circuited FCDI cell resulted in NaCl production in the water compartment and pH neutralization of both flow-electrodes.Apparently reversible Faradaic reactions that occur on the flow electrodes in the FCDI can be dependent on the properties of the carbon material, electrolyte composition and applied operational parameters (e.g. cell potential) and need to be studied in further detailed investigations.",

Previous attempts at imprinting Si using bulk metal electrodes have been limited by electrolyte blockage. Here, the problem is solved by using, for the first time, a nanoporous metal electrode that allows the electrolyte to access the entire Si/metal interface, irrespective of the electrode dimensions. As a proof of concept, imprinting of well-defined arrays of inverted pyramids has been performed with sub-micrometer spatial resolution over 1\u00a0mm2 using a nanoporous gold electrode of the complementary shape.

For all peptides tested, the oxidation current exhibited a peak (Ip) at the potential maximum (Emax) of about 0.6\u00a0V, a small peak or wave at 0.9\u20131.2\u00a0V and a large wave at 1.2\u20131.5\u00a0V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively corresponding to the electrochemical oxidation of Tyr-10, His (His-6, His-13, and His14), and Met-35 residues. To confirm the oxidation of Met-35 in A\u03b242 peptides, the short peptide A\u03b216 lacking the Met was employed. Each A\u03b242 isoform under study has displayed a specific oxidation voltammogram within the region of 0\u20131.5\u00a0V. The Tyr-10 based electrochemical analysis allowed to discriminate A\u03b242 from some of its isoforms, based on the Ip and the Emax values. It was shown that the oxidation currents of Tyr, His, and Met residues decrease upon the aggregation of A\u03b242 and its isoforms and can therefore be utilized to monitor the peptides' aggregation.",

When the electrode surface was functionalised with a member of the o-diphenol family, 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) was anchored onto the electrode surface via a boronate ester covalent bond. The anchored MPBA captured AgNPs through AgS interaction. The resulting surface-tethered AgNPs could recruit more MPBA molecules and AgNPs through the formation of an AgS bond and the covalent interaction between the \u03b1-hydroxycarboxylate of the citrate and the boronate of the MPBA. This led to in situ formation of a network of AgNPs. The complexes formed between MBPA and citrate acid, as well as dopamine (a member of the o-diphenol family), were characterized by mass spectrometry. The MBPA-induced aggregation of citrate-capped AgNPs in solution was confirmed by UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy.

In the present work, the oxidation of acetic acid by a boron doped diamond (BDD) anode was integrated with the cathodic production of hydrogen peroxide using a carbon felt gas diffusion electrode. A marked synergistic effect (synergy coefficient of 192.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.1%) is observed when the oxidation of acetic acid by hydroxyl radicals is performed together with the cathodic production of hydrogen peroxide. A maximum PAA production efficiency of 19.87% was obtained, a value much higher than previous works based on the oxidation of acetic acid by BDD anodes and approximately double the optimal value reported in studies based on the production of hydrogen peroxide.",

With this, microelectrodes and microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have been found to even further lower background currents without compromising sensitivity. As such, BDD MEAs are excellent electrode materials for a variety of electroanalytical applications, capable of multi-mode detection. We fabricated BDD MEAs adapting traditional semiconductor microfabrication processes; the resulting MEAs were patterned in different geometries to find an optimum electrochemical response, depending on the application. This is demonstrated using 4 different MEA geometries of different size and spacing using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), where the charge transfer resistance (Rct) increases as the electrodes are farther spaced from one another. Excellent sigmoidal voltammogram shape in CV was obtained for each BDD MEA geometry. BDD MEAs spaced farther from one another were found to give better resolution from the background in fast scan cyclic voltammetric measurements of dopamine due to the decrease in the double layer capacitance (Cdl) as verified with EIS. This work furthers the understanding of BDD MEAs and their pertinence to sensitive electroanalytical techniques.",

The exact reason for such pH-dependent activity is not very clear yet. Herein, through the XPS test of the mixture of a Fe/N/C catalyst and a solid acid\u2014Nafion, we found that the pyridinic N that is important for ORR, has been protonated completely. The protonation of pyridinic N in acidic medium may reduce the charge density of adjacent carbon atoms, which further influence the catalytic activity. Through comparison of ORR behaviors of three Fe/N/C catalysts prepared from different nitrogen sources, we observed that although all samples hold the same rule of ORR activity in alkaline medium higher than in acidic medium, the order the catalytic activity depends on the proportion of pyridinic N: the higher percent of pyridinic N, the higher sensitivity to the solution acidity/alkalinity. This study indicates that the pyridinic N has high ORR activity in alkaline medium, but when it is protonated in acidic medium, the catalytic activity is greatly suppressed.",

Instabilities in alkaline solution, particularly in comparison with kinetic properties in a conventional regime, are rarely reported in the literature, despite the fact that the catalytic activity is higher in this medium and the onset potential is shifted to lower values compared to acidic media. Ethanol oxidation on polycrystalline platinum exhibits oscillations under galvanostatic control. As the reaction is structure-sensitive, it is possible to study the contribution of the three platinum basal planes to the complex kinetics. We found that Pt(100) has the major influence in the overall non-linear kinetics of ethanol electro-oxidation on Pt(poly), possibly because it has the highest formation and accumulation rate of COads. Based on the differences observed in the galvanostatic transients on Pt(poly), Pt(110) and\\ Pt(100), and the absence of this behavior on Pt(111), it is possible to infer that surface sites strongly influence the kinetic scenario during the ethanol oxidation reaction.",

In this way, the phosphorylation recognition and signal output can be realized by a one-off solution, which significantly improves the simplicity of the kinase assay. Moreover, owing to the enriched NTA-Fe (III) on each nanoprobe and the continuous catalytic ability of each NTA-Fe (III), this method ensures very high sensitivity by dual signal amplification.

In this work we present a novel method for tailoring the surface of cation-exchange membranes based on the deposition of thin microgel monolayers. The charge of such layers exerts a strong influence on the monovalent-ion-selectivity, and this is reflected in the electrochemical impedance responses. Membranes coated with uncharged microgels show similar behavior to that of unmodified ones, with impedance spectra dominated by low-frequency diffusional arcs. However, membranes modified with positively charged microgels exhibit an increased resistance due to the hindered transport of cations through the modification. An additional high-frequency capacitive arc is obtained with the monovalent-ion-selective membranes, which is attributed to concentration polarization effects at the membrane/modification interface. The characteristic frequency of this arc decreases with the valency of the ion, thus proving that multivalent ions pass through the modification layer at rates much slower than monovalent ones. Accordingly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been used to feature monovalent-ion-selective properties of layered membranes.",

In this work, shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy was combined with an electrochemical method (EC-SHINERS) to study the adsorption and redox transformation of a resonant molecule viologen HS-8V8H at Au(hkl) single-crystal electrodes. Changes in the molecular structure with potential were identified on different single-crystal surfaces, which explained the transformation process of viologen from V2\u00a0+ state to V+ and then V0. Facet-dependent SERS enhancement was also observed, which results from the different imaginary part of the dielectric function on Au(111), Au(100) and Au(110), and is supported by the FEM simulations. Furthermore, a nonlinear resonant Raman process has been directly observed in our experiments, which is consistent with the simulation results.

However, on a commercial interdigitated device, the experiments carried out demonstrate that the contribution of an interfering species at the sensing electrode may be reduced if the potential of the other electrode is set to reduce that species. For the detection of N2H4 in presence of air, this translates to an improvement of >\u00a040% in the oxidation response for hydrazine recorded during Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) in a N2H4 0.5\u00a0mM solution. Further improvement was achieved by increasing the height of the set of microelectrodes dedicated to oxygen removal by Pt galvanostatic electrodeposition. The resulting oxidation response on such modified interdigitated microelectrodes was increased by almost 70%, and as much as 80% of O2 molecules was prevented to reach the sensing electrode.",

Preliminary experiments confirmed that electro-generation of hydrogen peroxide is possible in a system as the one proposed. Comparison with a flow-by cell with a gas diffusion cathode under similar conditions revealed that current efficiency towards hydrogen peroxide accumulation is even higher (72 vs 65% at 1\u00a0h) than in the case of the conventional system.

     "abstract": "Biofouling presents a significant obstacle to the long-term use of electrochemical sensors in complex media. Drinking water biofilms reduce performance of sensors by insulating electrode surfaces by inter alia inhibiting mass transport. Boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes are relatively resistant to biofouling and inert at high potentials. These qualities can be exploited to create a drinking water quality sensor that resists biofouling to meet performance criteria for longer, and to enable electrochemical cleaning of the sensor surface in situ using high potentials without disconnecting or disassembling the sensor.A purpose-built BDD wall-jet sensor was compared with a glassy carbon (GC) sensor in ability to determine free chlorine, detect biofilm and remove biofilm in situ. It was found that the BDD produced accurate and reliable readings with a 4.86% standard error and a LOD of 0.18\u00a0ppm. The BDD could be electrochemically cleaned in situ whereas this was less successful with the GC electrode. The BDD electrode could also detect electroactive pyocyanin, secreted in the biofilm of the drinking water biofilm indicator organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa, potentially enabling biofouling and non-biological fouling such as scaling to be distinguished. Observed changes in flow sensitivity and current-voltage curves that correspond to fouling provide multiple fouling detection methods, resulting in an accurate, sensitive, water quality sensor that can be cleaned without disassembly or replacement of parts and can identify when cleaning is required.",

Specifically, DNAzymes are designed to be activated after recognition between the target protein and its aptamer, pre-hybridized with a DNAzyme sequence. In the meantime, DNAzyme substrates are pre-modified on an electrode surface so as to expose their 5\u2032 phosphate end to conjugate with zirconia nanoparticles (ZrNPs), which have strong phosphoric affinity. The nanoparticles are also decorated with a large amount of signal molecule, peptide GHK. Consequently, a greatly amplified electrochemical signal can be achieved for the assay of the target protein. In addition to high sensitivity and simplicity, this strategy is also versatile, because it can easily be adapted to assay a large spectrum of targets simply by changing the sequence of the aptamer.

Such novel battery delivers an energy density of 183\u00a0Wh/kg based on the total mass of the active electrode materials.

The electrode material used is an electrodeposited thin film of birnessite, a non-toxic material, synthesised in very soft conditions. The original idea is to couple the spontaneous oxidative properties of birnessite to an electrochemical oxidation treatment in the aim to increase its reactivity towards this pollutant. Very good mineralisation rates and capacity (\u2248\u00a00.115\u00a0g AMPA mineralized by gramme of birnessite) were obtained with very low energy supplies (Q\u00a0\u2248\u00a03\u00a0C).

     "abstract": "As a redox couple for flow batteries, the effects of acetyl group substitution on ferrocene (Fc) are examined on the aspect of solubility, oxidation potential, and chemical/electrochemical stability. The solubility of acetyl ferrocene (AcFc) (0.81\u00a0M at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) is 4 times larger than that for ferrocene (0.2\u00a0M) in a propylene carbonate-based electrolyte solution. This is rationalized by a decrease in solute/solute interactions and enhanced solute/solvent interactions resulting from acetyl substitution. The former can be explained by the reduction of molecular symmetry, which leads to a looser molecular packing in the solid state. The melting point, which is another barometer for solute/solute interactions, is also lower for AcFc. The enhanced solute/solvent interactions are due to the addition of a polar acetyl group, which enhances the polar interactions between the acetyl group and propylene carbonate solvent. Meanwhile, the oxidation potential moves to the positive direction (3.65\u00a0V vs. Li/Li+ for AcFc and 3.44\u00a0V for Fc), which must be due to the introduction of an electron-withdrawing acetyl group. The acetyl ferrocene/acetyl ferrocenium couples are chemically/electrochemically stable at 3.3\u20134.1\u00a0V (vs. Li/Li+). Due to this stability, a Li/AcFc coin-type non-flowing cell shows a reasonably good cycleability and Coulombic efficiency of >\u00a098%.",

One of the three types of heme c in FDH is the electron-donating site to the electrodes, and another heme c is presumed to not be involved in the catalytic cycle. In order to confirm the electron transfer pathway, we constructed three mutants in which the sixth axial methionine ligand (M301, M450, or M578) of one of the hemes was replaced with glutamine, which was selected with the expectation that it would shift the formal potential of the hemes in the negative direction. An M450Q mutant successfully reduced the overpotential by approximately 0.2\u00a0V, giving a limiting current close to that of the native FDH. In contrast, an M301Q mutant remained almost unchanged and an M578Q mutant drastically decreased DET-type catalytic activity. The results indicate that the electron transfer in the native FDH occurs in sequence from the flavin, through the heme c with M578, to the heme c with M450 (as the electron-donating site to the electrodes), without going through the heme c with M301. The M450Q mutant will be useful for biofuel cells because of the decreased overpotential.",

The pulse electroplated Au micro-pillar acquired a high compressive strength of 800\u00a0MPa, and it was larger than the constant-current electroplated micro-pillar, which was 600\u00a0MPa.

The functionalization of an ionic liquid with ferrocene led to high concentrations of redox moieties in the electrolyte (2.4\u00a0M) and a large maximum operating voltage (2.5\u00a0V).

Conversely to common Mott\u2013Schottky experiments, the relevance of the multi-frequency Mott\u2013Schottky analysis relies on the determination of the space charge capacitance from a large frequency range impedance diagram. To analyze the Constant-Phase-Element behavior commonly observed for the impedance diagrams which characterize the passive film, the power-law model was used and allowed to determine the space charge capacitance. The consistency of the results showed that it was relevant to combine the power-law model to the predictive point defect model.

Square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) was used to detect As(III) in water with and without Cu(II) based on the following optimised conditions: pH\u00a0=\u00a03, deposition potential\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a0600\u00a0mV, and deposition time\u00a0=\u00a060\u00a0s. Ammonia solution was added to the analyte solution and the effect on mitigating copper interference was studied. The presence of ammonia complexed the Cu(II) ion thereby excluding Cu(II) from interfering with the As(III) signal.",

Due to favorability of host\u2013guest interactions between PS and D-Trp, PS preferably combined with D-Trp compared with L-Trp, resulting in larger amount of L-Trp penetrating through the left-handed double helices of PS to the electrode surface than D-Trp. And therefore, successful recognition of Trp isomers was achieved at the PS-based electrode. The PS-based chiral recognition was temperature dependent, which was attributed to the significant influence of temperature on the H-bonds between PS and the guest molecules. The recognition efficiency was remarkably decreased after hydroxypropyl groups were introduced to PS, and the decreased recognition efficiency at the hydroxypropyl PS (H-PS) might be due to the extra steric hindrance.",

Chronocoulometry was used as the technique to monitor the charging-discharging processes of swollen ACNT fibers in a presence of different electrolytes, i.e. LiCl, NaCl and KCl.

The presence of a gold layer on the nanorod surface slightly modifies the magnetic behaviour of the as-deposited nanorods, maintaining their soft-magnetic behaviour and high magnetization of saturation. The complete covering of the nanorods with the gold shell favours a good functionalization with a layer of (11-Mercaptoundecyl)hexa(ethylene glycol) molecules, in order to create a hydrophilic coating to avoid the aggregation of nanorods, keeping them in suspension and give them stability in biological media.

Once a reproducible and quasi-reversible wave was obtained, the repose of the electrode in the electrolyte solution during a few minutes allowed the recovery of the original voltammogram of the redox probe on the modified electrode. This behaviour is cyclic and can be understood as the result of a reversible reorganization effect of the organic film. This reorganization phenomenon is affected by the water content in the electrochemical cell, which can be explained by hydrogen bonds forming between the ester groups present in the structure film and water.",

Typically, in order to simplify the analysis, the non-rate-determining steps in the reaction mechanism are assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium. Here, Tafel analysis of the oxygen evolution reaction following the electrochemical oxide mechanism is performed using a full kinetic model. It is shown that this model (which uses the steady-state assumption) predicts a larger number of Tafel slopes than if the quasi-equilibrium assumption is used and provides and predicts the surface coverages which underpin these Tafel slopes. Importantly, this model predicts Tafel slopes of 30, 40, 60, and 120\u00a0mV, all of which are experimentally found on IrO2 and RuO2 anodes. Models using the quasi-equilibrium assumption fail to predict some Tafel regions, as these can occur when a non-rate-determining step is not at quasi-equilibrium.",

In order to prevent the degradation of the aromatic monomeric compounds into acids and CO2, a selective product removal strategy from the reaction environment is necessary. We report the use of an electrochemical membrane reactor for the continuous electrochemical cleavage of lignin integrated with an in-situ nanoporous filtration process. The generated cleavage products are removed through the nanofiltration membrane from the oxidative environment and product degradation is prevented.

We find that the HOR activity in the SBE is almost the same as in LBE, and is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than in SAE.

Potential regions of formation of soluble Sn(II) and Sn(IV) are identified by means of a rotating ring disk electrode. An anodic reactivation peak observed for cathodic potential scans for partially passivated electrodes is accompanied by formation of soluble Sn(II) species and a minimum in the imaginary part of the impedance. This confirms that the reactivation peak is due to active dissolution of metallic Sn exposed to the electrolyte during rupture of the oxidised layer.",

An advantageous combination of an enzyme substrate Hydroquinone diphosphate (HQDP) with silver ions (Ag+) in solution is presented in this work as a new enzymatic substrate for AP. This enzyme catalyzes the dephosphorylation of HQDP producing hydroquinone, a reducing agent for silver ions present in solution. Thus by mixing AP, HQDP and Ag+, metallic silver is deposited where the enzymatic reaction takes place. A qualitative assay is presented in nitrocellulose membranes to demonstrate this mechanism. The affinity reaction between streptavidin and biotin (labeled with AP) is also followed by the electrochemical detection of silver deposited on the surface of Screen Printed Carbon Electrodes.

Here, we describe a novel system for the continuous desalination of water based on FCDI using a single flow-electrode and a single module.

The utility of this biosensor is demonstrated for the detection of the C634R mutation through hybridization of the biotin-tagged target oligonucleotide with a surface-confined capture complementary probe and subsequent reaction with streptavidin-conjugated PbS QDs. The electrochemical transduction step involved anodic stripping voltammetric determination of the Pb(II) released after acidic dissolution of the QDs. Simultaneously with the electrolytic accumulation of Pb on the sensor surface, the embedded bismuth citrate was converted in situ to bismuth nanoparticles enabling ultra-trace Pb determination. The biosensor showed a linear relationship of the Pb(II) peak current with respect to the logarithm of the target DNA concentrations from 0.1\u00a0pmol L\u2212\u00a01 to 10\u00a0nmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01, and the limit of detection was 0.03\u00a0pmol L\u2212\u00a01.

Thus, the quantitative formulation of tortuosity factor is urgently needed in this regard.

Under these quite explicit conditions, very sharp reduction steps were observed near \u2212\u00a01.5\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl.

This phenomenon could be attributed to the insertion of CO2 into gold, leading to the formation of a thick iono-metallic multi-strata layer (less conducting than pure metal) that grows with the electrode charge. The formation of this new interface is due to the concur of three elements: transient CO2 anion radical, the metal, and rather small-sized cations (M+\u00a0=\u00a0Na+ or TMA+), the three possibly associated in a form {Au-CO2\u2212,M+} apparently very reactive with oxygen, moisture, and with some organic \u03c0-acceptors.

It is not clear which electrochemical processes could be approximated by such a model and hence, for which processes a poor approximation of the spectrum truly indicates a false measurement, instead of merely a lack of generality of the model. The scope of this paper is to derive from a system theory point of view, which class of systems can be approximated by serially connected RC elements and from that to conclude for which electrochemical systems the mentioned class of validity tests is applicable.

Secondly, the overhang of aptamer on the electrode surface can hybridize with RP DNA and trigger hybridization chain reaction (the second round of recycling). Consequently, large amount of electrochemical species hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride ([Ru(NH3)6]3\u00a0+) can be embedded into double-stranded DNA to produce a remarkable electrochemical signal, thus the target protein can be quantified with ultra-high sensitivity.

Following that, the electrochemical reduction of this molecule in acidic media containing sodium nitrite leads to the in situ formation of the corresponding diazonium, in the vicinity of the electrode, and subsequently the grafting of redox based ionic liquid molecule onto the electrode surface. The surface analysis of the attached layer confirms the formation of organic thin film strongly attached to the electrode surface, and evidences the presence of the components of the imidazolium ring, ferrocenyl unit, and TFSI anion. In addition, the modified electrode was electrochemically characterized by following the electrochemical signal of the attached ferrocenyl unit. Finally, the electrochemical reversible wettability of the modified electrode upon oxidation and reduction process was demonstrated.",

Compounds with phenol/amine groups show a large increase of the current intensity with increasing CNT oxidation, while for carbonyl containing compounds only a negligible effect was perceived.

     "abstract": "Soil washing using surfactant solutions is a very effective and widely used technique for the remediation of polluted soil. However, it is not a finalistic technology and once the pollutant is transferred to the washing-solution, the resulting aqueous waste has to be treated. In this work, the feasibility of Conductive-Diamond Electrochemical-Oxidation (CDEO) to treat the effluent of a surfactant-aided soil washing process was studied and some important mechanistic aspects were pointed out. Atrazine was selected as the model pesticide and sodium dodecyl sulfate (anionic surfactant) was used as washing agent. Besides COD, TOC, and pollutants concentration, the changes of z-potential and particle size were monitored during electrolysis in order to clarify the degradation mechanisms involved in the electrochemical treatment of emulsions. The results show that CDEO enables a complete reduction in the organic load of the waste. However, the process efficiency seems to be influenced by the size of particles present in the reaction media, which decreases continuously during the treatment. Steric hindrance of the large micelles (mean size 1100\u00a0um) seems to prevent direct oxidation of micelles on the anodic surface and hence only mediated processes can explain the results obtained. In this case, it may be assumed that peroxocarbonate (from carbonate salts added as supporting electrolyte) and peroxosulfate ions (formed from the oxidation of sulfate ions released from SDS molecule) are the main species expected according to the washing fluid composition.",

In this technique, the temperature of the interface is suddenly increased by applying short laser pulses. The change of the electrode potential caused by the thermal perturbation is measured under coulostatic conditions during the subsequent temperature relaxation. This change is mainly related to the reorganization of the solvent components near the electrode surface. The sign of the potential transient depends on the potential of the experiment. At high potential values, positive transients indicate a higher density of anions than cations close the surface, contributing negatively to the potential of the electrode. Decreasing the applied potential to sufficiently low values, the transient becomes negative, meaning that the density of cations becomes then higher at the surface of the electrode. The potential dependence of the interfacial response shows a marked hysteresis depending on the direction in which the applied potential is changed.",

Changes in the electrochemical surface area of the platinum cathode as a result of power cycling are measured in situ for the first time using hydrogen underpotential cyclic voltammetry. The results demonstrate that degradation of the platinum cathode plays a more significant role than conventionally assumed by the electrolyser community, which has tended to focus more on the iridium/ruthenium oxide anode because it dominates the performance of the cell.",

     "abstract": "One of the ways of improving electrodialysis (ED) and some microfluidic processes is the optimization of current regime. It is recognised now that the use of pulsed electric fields (PEF) in ED allows enhancement of mass transfer and mitigation of fouling. To explain these effects, Mishchuk et al. [1] suggested that due to inertial forces electroosmotic mixing can remain during the pause. By solving fully coupled Nernst\u2013Planck\u2013Poisson\u2013Navier\u2013Stokes equations, we compute the distribution of velocity, concentration and electric fields in an ED channel. We simulate the situation where electroconvective vortices occur or not in the pause, and show that the total vortex attenuation takes tenths of a second. However, inertial forces are effective only first 0.01 s, then the vortices are fed by the chemical energy of non-uniform concentration field, the relaxation time of which is several seconds. The remnant vortices contribute to earlier onset of electroconvection. However, more important is the formation of new vortices after voltage re-application. For the first time, we show that nonuniformity of concentration field produces an effect similar to the action of electrically or geometrically non-uniform surface. It causes formation of spatially non-uniform electric body force, which hastens electroconvection.",

BaCO3 nanoparticles are formed from thermal decomposition of barium acetate, Ba(Ac)2 infiltrated to porous cathode skeleton and shows good chemical compatibility with cathode materials. BaCO3 nanoparticles can greatly reduce the area specific resistance (ASR) of typical SOFC cathode materials, including La0.8Sr0.2FeO3\u00a0-\u03b4 (LSF), La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3\u00a0-\u03b4 (LSCF) and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3\u00a0-\u03b4 (LSM). For example at 700\u00a0\u00b0C, ASR for LSF on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte decreases from 2.95\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm2 to 0.77\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm2 when 12.9\u00a0wt.% BaCO3 nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of the porous LSF electrode. Impedance spectra analysis shows that the decrease in ASR mainly comes from the reduction of the low frequency resistance. Furthermore, BaCO3 nanoparticles are found to greatly enhance the oxygen chemical exchange coefficient. Most importantly, it has been found that the catalytic activity of BaCO3 nanoparticles is even higher than those of the precious metals such as Pd, Rh, Pt and Ag, infiltrated into LSF, LSCF and LSM electrodes supported on YSZ electrolytes.",

This presumes growing conditions, when the substituent promotes electrophilic substitution in para-position relatively amino-group. Thus electropolymerization of 3-aminophenylboronic acid (3-APBA) requires free fluoride ions to convert boronic acid residue to trifluoroborate serving as electron donor. On the contrary, when in ortho-position to amino-group, boronic acid does not hamper the polyaniline-type growth, but its conversion to trifluoroborate inhibits the polymerization. Accordingly, optimal media for electropolymerization of 2-aminobenzeneboronic acid (2-APBA) are strong acidic solutions similar to unsubstituted aniline. Conducting polyaniline-type polymers synthesized from both isomers generate an increase in their conductivity as a response to polyols (saccharides and hydroxy acids) according to the mechanism of self-doping by freezing negative charges in ring substituents upon complexation. This comprises the novel detection principle for reagentless affinity sensors, allowing to discriminate the specific affinity interactions from non-specific bindings.",

However, almost all of these reports perform experiments in the presence of oxygen (a natural mediator of oxidase) and whether the GOx with DET property retained their catalytic activity in the absence of mediators has not been studied in detail so far. In this paper, we investigated the DET property and enzyme activity of GOx on graphene surface without and with mediators. Experimental results showed that the biosensor had no response to glucose in mediator-free solutions, even though the DET of GOx was observed, indicating that the GOx with DET property lacked enzymatically catalytic activity. However, in the presence of mediators, the biosensor showed sensitive response to glucose, illustrating that the mediated enzymatic oxidation of glucose occurred, which can be attributed to the catalytically active GOx without DET capability. These results suggest that DET property and enzyme catalytic activity cannot occur on the same GOx simultaneously. Therefore, keeping enzyme activity and DET of GOx at the same time is still a major challenge for biosensor and biofuel cell researches.",

     "abstract": "Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) is an important DNA repair enzyme that can excise the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) from damaged DNA and is implicated in the etiology of many kinds of cancers. Here, we report an electrochemical method to assess the activity of hOGG1 by using a carefully designed DNA probe, which contains an internal 8-oxoG site and an electrochemical active tag. In this method, hOGG1 can selectively recognize the 8-oxoG site and cleave the probe DNA, releasing a methylene blue (MB)-labeled signal fragment. The signal fragment can then hybridize with the DNA molecules that have been previously immobilized on a gold electrode surface. Consequently, a sensitive electrochemical technique, square wave voltammetry, can be employed for the signal readout, thus characterizing the activity of hOGG1. This method is simple, sensitive and specific, and it has been used for human serum samples, so it may imply a potential new method for the assay of hOGG1.",

This paper focuses on effects in anode microstructure on performance and durability of microtubular SOFCs. The evaluations were conducted under high steam content and internal methane reforming conditions using Ni\u2013YSZ anodes using acrylic resin and graphite pore formers. The initial cell performance was almost identical to that of SOFCs with anodes using acrylic resin and graphite pore formers in 40% H2\u20133% H2O at 700\u00a0\u00b0C. However, the anode using acrylic resin deteriorated rapidly in 40% H2\u201330% H2O over a period of 28\u00a0h. Furthermore, it generated almost no electric power by internal steam reforming of methane. The local oxidation of nickel particles was observed at the interface between the electrolyte and the deteriorated anodes. The anode using graphite pore former provided stable power generation in 40% H2\u201330% H2O, and was able to generate power in 10% CH4\u201330% H2O.

     "abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO) was applied for construction of an effective biocathode based on bilirubin oxidase (BOD). Separation of small-sized GO sheets together with the BOD immobilisation protocol has detrimental effects on the bioelectrocatalytic reduction of oxygen. When BOD was deposited on electrochemically reduced GO (ErGO) only a negligible current density j\u00a0=\u00a02.6\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02 was observed. Current density dramatically increased to a value of 46\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02 once BOD was in-situ mixed with as-received GO directly on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with subsequent electrochemical reduction of the BOD/GO composite. When this protocol was tested with small-sized GO flakes separated simply using centrifugation, the fabricated biocathode exhibited j\u00a0=\u00a0120\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02. A current density further increased to j\u00a0=\u00a0280\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02 when BOD and purified GO were incubated ex-situ for 4\u00a0h, followed by the BOD/GO composite collection by centrifugation, its deposition on the GCE and electrochemical reduction. Moreover, oxygen reduction current increased steeply with a steady-state current density achieved at high potential (\u2248\u00a0500\u00a0mV), close to the onset potential of oxygen reduction (\u2248\u00a0580\u00a0mV).",

Comparing to the solution with low alcohol concentration and the same CO2 concentration, we observe a significant reduction of mass signal of CO2 in a concentrated methanol or ethanol solution (>\u00a00.1\u00a0M). Possible origins for this are: 1) alcohol molecules evaporate into the vacuum chamber and reduce the ionization probability for CO2 via competition for electrons; and 2) CO2 is trapped in the hydrophobic alcohol cages formed in the aqueous electrolyte. A proper way to eliminate alcohol concentration effect on the detected CO2 mass signal in DEMS studies on fuel cell related electrocatalysis is suggested.",

After the proteolysis process, the substrate can be cleaved coupled with the decline of Rct. The electrical properties of the substrate residues on the electrode may also change, leading to the subsequent adsorption of AuNPs. Due to the excellent electrical conductivity of AuNPs, Rct can be further decreased, which can be used to reveal the proteolysis process.

The IAB architecture with a hairpin structure consisted of an aptamer arm and a ferrocene (Fc)-labeling signal arm, and was inverted on the electrode through a thiol-linker on the middle site of its loop. The inverted immobilization strategy prevented the end-labeling of ferrocene tag from approaching the electrode, thus resulting in a weak electrochemical signal. In the presence of thrombin, binding of target with the aptamer arm displaced the signaling arm, producing a flexible single-stranded element, i.e. internal-displacement which allowed Fc tag to collide with the electrode, thereby producing a relatively strong electrochemical signal. By monitoring the increased signal, thrombin could be readily detected in the signal-on mode with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.21\u00a0nM. Inspiringly, the IAB-based strategy required no auxiliary strands and did not depend on structure-switching of specific aptamer/target couple, thus presenting as a generalized method for fabrication of other electrochemical aptasensors.",

The evidence of chromatographic analysis also indicates that the oxidation carried out by the diamonds with a lower content of sp3-carbon is softer, favoring electrochemical conversion of RhB instead of mineralization. This degradation pathway is followed because higher graphite content on BDD anode leads to a higher direct electrochemical activity. These results are of a paramount significance for the choice of electrodes that could guarantee high efficiencies in wastewater remediation processes; because they clearly indicate that the sp3-sp2 carbon ratio should be kept as higher as possible in order to completely deplete pollutants and intermediates from the waste.",

However, its light-to-electricity conversion in photoelectrochemical devices is still inferior because of the high electron\u2013hole recombination rate. Polyoxometalates (POMs) act as an efficient electron acceptor, which could capture the photogenerated electrons from conduction band of semiconductors and thus retard the electron\u2013hole recombination. Here we study for the first time the effect of polyoxometalate electron acceptor on photoelectrochemical performance of SnO2, and demonstrate that the photocurrent and power conversion efficiency of the SnO2/POMs composite photoanode are markedly enhanced in comparison with that of the pristine SnO2 photoanode. The enhanced photovoltaic performance is attributed to the occurrence of photogenerated electron transfer from SnO2 to POMs; this decreases electron\u2013hole recombination in SnO2. Furthermore, the SnO2/POM photoanode also showed significant photoelectrooxidation activity for methanol, which provides a further support for the functional mechanism of POMs in SnO2.

Amperometric glucose sensing electrodes are fabricated by immobilizing glucose oxidase in a PIC double-layer. The proper double-layer configuration is efficient to improve the glucose response, blocking interferents due to the molecular sieving effect.",

Here we reported the concept of an ion-exchange membrane bioelectrochemical reactor (IEMBER) that integrates the transport of nitrate from a wastewater chamber through an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) with its bioelectrochemical reduction in a separate cathode chamber. Successful removal of nitrate in the biological effluent from a coking wastewater treatment plant was achieved, in good agreement with the obvious cathodic current observed in the IEMBER when its cathode was poised at a potential of \u2212\u00a00.50\u00a0V (vs. SCE).

     "abstract": "In conventional porous cathodes of non-aqueous lithium-air batteries, the higher discharge reaction rate in the oxygen richer region will result in a gradient distribution of the solid product, Li2O2, decreasing from the air side to the separator side. Such a distribution of the solid product means that although the pores toward the separator side remain open, the pores at the air side will be blocked first with an increase in the discharge capacity, terminating the discharge process and resulting in a low discharge capacity. In this work, we design and fabricate a cathode structure with a stepwise gradient pore distribution (pore size reducing from 500 to 300 and 100\u00a0nm) by mixing carbon powder and nanotubes. The gradient porous cathode enables the capacity of a non-aqueous lithium-air battery discharging at 0.1\u00a0mA/cm2 to be 19.2% higher than that by a uniform porous cathode (~\u00a0100\u00a0nm in pore size) and 82.3% higher than that by a uniform porous cathode (~\u00a0500\u00a0nm in pore size). The SEM image analysis suggests that the increased discharge capacity can be mainly attributed to the fact that the gradient cathode can not only increase oxygen transport pathways but also retain a sufficiently large specific surface area.",

Operation with 15\u00a0g\u00a0NaCl/l water solution resulted in extremely high apparent salt adsorption capacity (SAC) value of 260\u00a0mg/gdry carbon. This value is much higher than the highest value of SAC reported until now \u2014 14.3\u00a0mg/g. The reason for this phenomenon is not clear and further research is currently performed. In a new truly continuous process, both slurry streams are continuously recirculated between the desalination module and a regeneration/concentration module operated with the same functionality but with reversed potential.

In this study the hydrodehalogenation of CHCl3 is selected as model reaction in order to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of 2\u201315\u00a0nm silver nanoparticles. For the electrochemical characterization a versatile experimental setup was purportedly in-house designed and assembled that allows both cyclic voltammetry and electrolysis investigations.

Cycling a smooth polycrystalline Pt electrode in alkaline electrolyte within the water stability domain prior to the BOR characterization radically changes the shape of the BOR voltammogram obtained in hydrodynamic conditions using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup, compared to the \u201cclassical\u201d one measured on a smooth polycrystalline Pt electrode just polished before the BOR RDE study. This particular BOR voltammogram is reversibly brought back to the \u201cclassical\u201d one after voltammetric cycling in borohydride alkaline media. These changes in the BOR voltammogram highlight the sensitivity of the BOR mechanism towards the Pt surface morphology. A first comparison of the Pt electrode surface before and after the voltammetric cycling in alkaline media using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows no morphological differences between the two surfaces within the AFM observation range, suggesting a very fine atomic structure disordering of the Pt surface. Such strong dependence of the BOR mechanism on Pt regarding the electrode atomic structuring opens the way to future studies focusing on the BOR on well-defined Pt single crystals.",

Alternatively, the injection of very small amounts of transition metals (not only Pd, but also Au, Ag or Pt) at zero-valent state into the graphene layer may induce catalytic reduction of RIs and RBrs that allows the formation of free radicals R and their concomitant grafting, not only at the GC/graphene interface but also in bulk graphene that plays the role of a three-dimensional radical scavenger. Therefore, by use of this simple process, GC/graphene layers could be converted into a 3D active interface. In order to quantify the global grafting/insertion of R, ferrocene and aryl probes (Fc-n-alkyl-I and pyrene-CH2-Br) were used, attesting to significant modification of the interface. Thus, for the first time, a bulky graphene\u2013ferrocene layer (a redox system fully usable as a 3D modified electrode) was built.

In this paper, we report a new concept to construct photoelectrochemical sensors based on the interaction between photo-excited electrons of quantum dots (QDs) and electron acceptors. It was found that benzoquinone (BQ) could act as an efficient electron acceptor of the photo-excited CdS QDs, thus blocking the electron transfer of CdS to the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, leading to decreased photocurrent. Based on this phenomenon, a novel photoelectrochemical sensor for dopamine (DA) was developed. DA can be oxidized under weakly alkaline (pH\u00a09.0) solution or by electro-deposition in neutral (pH\u00a07.0) solution to form poly-dopamine. Poly-dopamine has abundant benzoquinone (BQ) groups, which acted as electron acceptors of the conduction band electrons of the photo-excited CdS QDs, leading to decreased photocurrent of CdS QDs. The method could detect DA with highly selectivity and sensitivity. This photoelectrochemical strategy based on photo-induced electron transfer between the electron acceptor and QDs opened a new avenue for the design of novel photoelectrochemical sensors.",

Beside a main two-electron step currently observed at potential\u00a0>\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.0\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl, a bell-shaped step appears with all organic iodides within a potential range between \u2212\u00a00.6\u00a0V and \u2212\u00a01.2\u00a0V. This peak does not depend on the organic substrate concentration, its current is proportional to the scan rate in voltammetry; it disappears at the second scan. These features arise from slow adsorption of the RI at gold, followed by an electro-catalytic reduction induced by the metal. It is expected that this (simple) process allows the formation of alkyl radicals readily adsorbed at the metal surface and thus produced layer strongly inhibits the main cathodic step at more negative potentials.

The corresponding extended limits of solubility are characterized by continuous variations in the metrics that mirror the entry of Na occupancy values into thermodynamically forbidden regions. A major consequence of this smoothed phase transformation is a significant decrease in the lattice volume mismatch, which could well compensate for the less efficient Na-based systems with respect to SEI and adverse effect of cation size in comparison to Li batteries. Comparison of the lattice volume mismatch on charge and discharge revealed an explanation for the asymmetry of the electrochemical curve.",

In the proposed method, the potential applied to the catalyst sample is changed stepwise. A micro-electrode serving as SECM tip is positioned in known close proximity to the catalyst surface and is used to detect the onset of the formation of the product of the catalytic reaction, specifically gas generation at the sample surface. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at model RuO2 and perovskite catalyst surfaces is used to evaluate the approach. The suggested method is supposed to provide a clearer and sensitive means for the detection of the onset potentials of electrolytic gas evolution reactions as compared to conventional procedures which mainly use cyclic voltammetry on stationary or rotating (ring) disk electrodes. Moreover, the detection of the reaction product at the SECM tip allows distinguishing between parasitic reactions at the catalyst surface and the true formation of the anticipated reaction product.",

The utility of this technique was subsequently evaluated for PCE-spiked environmental samples containing either Methylobacterium adhaesivum (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0cells/mL) or creek water (10% v/v). In all environmental samples, a linear dynamic range was also observed from approximately 0 to 10\u00a0\u03bcM.

The Cu3Sn phase is inactive for lithiation at ambient temperature, but becomes active to be lithiated at elevated temperatures. Hence, when the Cu3Sn deposit, which makes an intimate contact with the lithiated graphite, is exposed to high-temperature environment, it is lithiated by taking Li+ ions/electrons from the lithiated graphite. As a result, the degree of lithiation in graphite decreases. The formation of local galvanic cell, in which Li+ ions/electrons are transferred from the graphite electrode to the Cu3Sn deposit, is confirmed by electrochemical and X-ray diffraction analysis. The heat generation that is resulted from the exothermic reactions between graphite and electrolyte, which is known to be smaller with a decrease in the degree of lithiation in graphite, is greatly reduced as a result of galvanic cell formation.

Here we report the use of an in-situ scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) to characterise local current density distributions over anodically-polarised Mg surfaces immersed in sodium chloride containing electrolyte. Anodic dissolution is shown to be highly localised in nature and accompanied by significant cathodic activity. The area occupied by local cathodes increases with time and both total anodic and cathodic currents emerging from the exposed Mg surface are shown to rise accordingly. It is also demonstrated that increasing the anodic current supplied to the Mg causes local cathode areas to grow more rapidly, hence accounting for progressively greater hydrogen evolution rates. These observations demonstrate that hydrogen evolution remains a cathodic process, thus invalidating the Mg+ theory of dissolution.",

     "abstract": "In this paper, we have presented the results of our investigation of galvanoluminescence (GL) originating from oxide films obtained by anodization of titanium in alkaline solutions. For the first time we have measured weak GL during the anodization of titanium and found strong influence of sample's surface pretreatment, as well as anodizing conditions (current density and electrolyte temperature). GL is more intense for rougher titanium samples, higher current density, and higher temperature of electrolyte. Spectral characterization of GL showed that there are wide GL bands present mostly in the visible and near infrared spectral region. As the potential of anodization approaches the breakdown voltage, a numerous transient sparks appear superimposed on the GL.",

Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirmed that multilayer graphene was formed on the Ni substrate by the CVD method. Raman spectra of HOPG and CVD graphene revealed that these materials were almost defect-free. In contrast to bare GC, the electron transfer kinetics towards the Fe(CN)63\u00a0\u2212/4\u00a0\u2212 redox couple was significantly slower on HOPG and CVD graphene surfaces. In addition, HOPG and CVD-grown graphene electrodes were rather inactive for oxygen reduction in alkaline medium compared with bare GC. Similar electrochemical behaviour of HOPG and CVD graphene surfaces was in evidence.",

     "abstract": "Polarization tests have become a common technique to study pitting corrosion behavior of stainless steel. Based on these experimental tests, the pitting potential value may be determined at the potential at which current density reaches the value of 100\u00a0\u03bcA/cm2. The potential at this value of current density, associated to the breakdown potential, provides useful information about the likelihood of suffering pitting corrosion in the material under study: a more positive pitting potential means that the material can be expected to be more resistant to pitting corrosion. In this paper, a model based on Bayesian neural networks is presented in order to predict this potential value in different environmental conditions. In this way, it is possible to make comparison of corrosion resistance of the material under study in different environmental conditions. The results based on correlation coefficient and root mean square show the utility of this tool to predict potential values without requiring the use of polarization tests.",

     "abstract": "The most common practice in determining the coulombic efficiency (CE) of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) is to charge and discharge the VRFB to designated cutoff voltages and then use the corresponding charging and discharging times to compute the CE. A major shortcoming of this technique is that it does not account for the change in the system's capacity during cycling due the crossover of vanadium ions. Rather than using cutoff voltages, an alternative approach is to use state-of-charge (SOC) limits since any change in the system's capacity can be captured by tracking the SOC of the device. In this study, these two techniques were investigated to assess their effectiveness in quantifying the CE in a manner that accurately captures the physical processes governing the device operation. A performance model was utilized to simulate the VRFB operation under different currents and the CE of the device was computed using both techniques. Results indicate that CEs computed using SOC limits were consistently lower than those computed using cutoff voltages, and they were consistent with the change in the chemical state of the electrolytes during cyclic operation.",

This study confirms that chemisorption of adenine induces the lifting of the Au(111) surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the 4% excess gold atoms of the reconstructed surface, which are expelled during lifting of the reconstruction, do not diffuse away from the reconstruction rows. We observe, in contrast, the formation of nanometric islands arranged forming chains along the directions previously followed by the reconstruction solitons. Chemisorbed adenine adlayers consist of short chains of adenine molecules roughly aligned along the three main crystallographic directions of the substrate and stabilized by \u03c0 stacking. These chains tend to align parallel to each other, forming very small domains and yielding an adlayer with a very short-range order. The same adlayer structure is observed at all the studied pH values.

To solve this problem, an ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, mediated electrochemical CO2 reduction was coupled with a Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 catalyzed anodic oxidation in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). In the MEC mode, the electrochemical CO2 reduction was triggered at \u2212\u00a00.1\u00a0V. The CO2 reduction rate increased as the external voltage decreased from \u2212\u00a00.1 to \u2212\u00a00.5\u00a0V. From the aspect of CO2 reduction selectivity, \u2212\u00a00.4\u00a0V was the optimized external voltage. The low initiation voltage offered the possibility of powering the MEC with a microbial fuel cell (MFC). Therefore, a MEC-MFC-coupled system was developed to electrochemically reduce CO2. The results indicated that an MFC producing the maximal power density of 18.5\u00a0W/m2 could successfully power the CO2 reduction at a rate of 0.06\u00a0mmol/m2\u00a0h in the MEC.

Though nano-structuring of electrode materials generally improves the kinetics of the charge transport, thereby increasing the power density, the drawback is the low density of these electrodes compromising the energy density.

Here we present a facile and low cost templating method using carbonate salts creating 3D interconnected ionic pathways that improve the ionic charge transport without compromising the electrode density significantly. The method was demonstrated for C/Li4Ti5O12 electrode material resulting in excellent capacity retention reaching ~\u00a090% at 5\u00a0C and ~\u00a050% at 200 C rate combined with high active material electrode densities around 1.45 gm/cm3.",

The thionine-capped DiDNA/AuNP conjugate was acted as a tag. In the absence of the target DNA, the flexible single-stranded PDNA supports an efficient contact between tag and electrode, ensuring high current of the E-DNA sensor. Upon hybridization, a rigid probe-target duplex is formed, which pushes the tag away from the electrode and increases the distance between the tag and the electrode, thereby decreasing the current of the E-DNA sensor. The analytical method based on this concept is highly sensitive because the thionine-capped DiDNA/AuNP conjugate contains a large number of electroactive thionine molecules. Under optimal conditions, the dynamic detection range of the target DNA was from 1.0\u00a0pM to 100\u00a0pM, and the detection limit was 0.5\u00a0pM.

Stainless steel samples (SS304), acting as bipolar electrodes, were immersed in sulphuric and hydrochloric acid and exposed to an electric field to establish a potential gradient along the surface. In this way, the same steel sample was exposed to a wide range of cathodic and anodic conditions, ranging from potentials yielding hydrogen evolution to potentials well into the transpassive region. This wireless approach enables rapid simultaneous comparison of numerous samples, and also provides the opportunity to perform experiments on samples that are of a complex shape, or which otherwise are difficult to employ in standard electrochemical corrosion tests.",

The produced Cu(I) undergoes two competing reactions. One reaction is the electro-oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) on the electrode surface which induces the increase of the anodic peak current of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox couple in the presence of glucose. Another is the oxidation of Cu(I) by dissolved oxygen to produce H2O2 which was subsequently reduced on the electrode surface.",

It is demonstrated that spin polarization may play a catalytic role, parallel with the effect of overlap of reactant orbitals with the d-band of a metal electrode. Our model is based on two main assumptions: (i) some metal surfaces favor the existence of singlet molecular oxygen in adsorbed state; and (ii) short-living singlet O2 molecules may appear as intermediates at some reduction steps. These two reasons are expected to increase the local concentration of active singlet molecular oxygen in reaction layer.",

This effect was explained by the proximity of counterions to the MPC surface, which determines whether the electronic charges on MPCs can be effectively compensated by formation of ion pairs. Only small counterions are permitted to approach the MPC surface by permeating the alkanethiolate layer to achieve a sufficient charge compensation. In contrast, big ions are sterically excluded and thus disfavor the electrochemical charging. This finding helps in further understanding the ion-coupled electrochemical charging mechanism of nanoparticle films.",

Given that organic residues in the fingerprint deposit make the underlying surface electrochemically inert or less active, ECL reaction occurs only on the surface untouched by the fingertip, generating a negative impression with a dark ridge pattern against the illuminated background.

The C\u2013Ag\u2013Pt three-electrode system was also demonstrated. To reduce the electrical resistance, the carbon electrode was made on a silver intermediate layer which was simultaneously fabricated with Ag electrodes. A PMMA/poly(dimethylsiloxane) electrochemical sensing microchip with the Au\u2013Ag\u2013Pt three-electrode systems was constructed. The reproducibility of the three-electrode system from single and different microchips was characterized. The performance of the microchip was evaluated by two kinds of electrochemical probes (Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and dopamine).",

A bipolar membrane (BPM) was placed next to the anode to prevent Cl\u2212 contamination and acidification of the anolyte, and to produce protons for HCl recovery. A 5-cell paired reverse-electrodialysis (RED) stack provided the electrical energy required to overcome the BPM over-potential (0.3\u20130.6\u00a0V), making the overall process spontaneous. The MRCC reactor produced electricity (908\u00a0mW/m2) as well as concentrated acidic and alkaline solutions, and therefore did not require an external power supply.

Addition of 10\u00a0\u03bcM LiClO4 (<\u00a01:800 Li+ to TEA+ ratio) strongly affects the ORR mechanism: Both disk (ID) and ring (IR) currents strongly decrease, with less than 0.5% O2\u2212 produced at the GC disk reaching the ring electrode, but still IR follows the same potential dependence as ID. On the other hand, addition of DMSO to acetonitrile 0.1\u00a0M LiClO4 stabilizes soluble O2\u2212 detected at the ring since DMSO preferentially solvates Li+ preventing disproportionation of LiO2 into O2 and passivating Li2O2.",

When studying electrochemical reactions catalysed by macrocyclic transition metal complexes adsorbed on graphite electrodes, volcano correlations are found when plotting the activity versus the formal potential of the catalyst for several reactions, assuming that the formal potential is somehow related to the free energy of the adsorption of the reacting molecule. In this work we offer an interpretation different from that given in the literature for these correlations for the electrooxidation of hydrazine. The highest catalytic activity is achieved when the formal potential of the catalyst approaches the N2H4/N2 reversible potential. In contrast, if log i (normalized for the actual surface concentrations of Fe(II) active sites at constant potential) is plotted versus the difference between the Fe(II)/(I) formal potential of the catalysts and the standard potential of the N2H4/N2 reaction, the correlation is linear with a slope close to 2RT/F.",

Au microband arrays were formed by closely contacting the micropatterned hydrogel stamp soaked with a solution of water-based etching solution with Au film sputtered on a glassy chip. Scanning electron microscopy results demonstrate that the formed Au microband arrays are uniform and had good resolution. Electrochemical results show that the Au microband arrays exhibit fast mass transport and low charging current, suggesting that the Au microband arrays fabricated with soft lithography behave like a microelectrode array (MEA). These electrochemical properties of the Au band MEA essentially made it very attractive for sensitive electroanalysis, which was illustrated by voltammetric determination of ferricyanide and dopamine down to submicromolar level.",

The in situ generated H2O2 then reacts with the sparged O3 to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH), which are a much stronger oxidant than O3. Thus, by utilizing the sparged O2 that has little value in ozonation processes to produce H2O2 in situ, the E-peroxone process can achieve the synergy of O3 and H2O2 (peroxone) on pollutant degradation. The E-peroxone process therefore mineralized MB much more effectively than ozonation. The total organic carbon removal was 93 and 22% after 2\u00a0h of the E-peroxone and ozonation treatment, respectively.

An increase in the upper potential limit (UPL) during potential cycling or an increase in the holding potential during potential steps leads to an enhancement in the amount of dissolved gold.

The formed hydroxyl radical, as the substantial cause of DNA damage, was validated by Ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy.

Moreover, the humidity performance of the MOA sensor indicated good sensitivity of 8045.55 at 98% RH.

Exposing the MOA sensor to different humidities for longer durations indicated an excellent stability due to the \u03b1-Al2O3 phase in the MOA film. The mechanism in the sensor, to humidity, was explained by using equivalent circuits of (RC) and (C(RZ)). In the low RH range, the process was mainly dominated by the migration of protons through the adsorbed water molecule layer on the surface of the MOA film; while, in the high RH range, the process was due to the faster diffusion of protons in the single or multiple layers that were formed on the materials surface.",

Specifically, calixarene derivative is immobilized on a gold electrode surface. Then, HCCR-1 antibody is further loaded on the electrode surface, which may capture HCCR-1 in serum. Since the recognition of HCCR-1 in serum can be monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the experimental results may show a different EIS response between the patients with HCC and the healthy subjects, HCC can be easily identified by our approach.

The results also show promise that parameters of the constant phase element (which is used in impedance spectroscopy to account for the frequency dispersion) obtained as a function of the electrode potential can be reasonably used to detect 2D phase transitions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

     "abstract": "Carbon-supported Se-modified-Ru catalysts (RuSey/C) were synthesized, and their phosphate adsorption characteristics were evaluated using electrochemical techniques and in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). When phosphoric acid was added, the ORR activity of unmodified Ru/C decreased by 26.8% because the active sites were blocked by electrochemical adsorption, as confirmed by CV. However, for RuSey/C, the ORR activity was enhanced with phosphoric acid (RuSe1.56/C: 63.8%), which indicates that the kinetics at each site increased to compensate for the site blocking effect. The XAS results demonstrated that, for RuSey/C, phosphoric acid molecules or phosphate anions primarily interacted with Se atoms, and the oxidation state of Ru atoms decreased. Therefore, it was concluded that the enhanced ORR kinetics originated from the decreased oxygen binding energy with larger electrostatic repulsion.",

The starting point is a previously published 3D reconstruction from FIB/SEM images with three phases, the active material domain, carbon-binder domain and pore space. Based on this geometrical configuration, we compute effective diffusivities, from which we in turn derive tortuosity values for the pore space ranging between 5 and 11.6 for the three spatial directions. In a next step, we compare our approach to an imaging method that employs back-filling material. These methods do not differentiate between the carbon-binder domain and the pore space. Thus we remove the carbon-binder domain from our 3D reconstruction and add its volume to the pore space. As a result of this procedure, the tortuosity is greatly reduced to values between 1.5 and 1.9. Experiments suggest that both results for tortuosity are inaccurate and that the real values lie somewhere between these parameter sets. Hence, based on experimental data, we propose a nanoporous carbon-binder domain and derive intermediate tortuosity values between 4.2 and 6.1. These values are consistent with experimental values for similar Li-ion cathodes reported previously.",

Films grown from the strong electrolyte solution were largely invariant in composition, whereas the weak solution produced highly potential sensitive alloy compositions.

The electrochemical reduction of Pb2\u00a0+ to Pb, which accumulates on the electrode surface, brings about destruction of the G-quadruplex structure.

Polypyrrole (PPy) film, doped with p-toluenesulfonate, has been coated onto activated carbon (AC) electrode preform. Although the specific capacitance of the electrode is doubled, from 176\u00a0F/g to 352\u00a0F/g, with coating of 17.7\u00a0wt.% PPy, the capacitance lost nearly 60% after 10,000\u00a0cycles at 40\u00a0\u00b0C, in contrast to 20% loss at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. It is demonstrated that the problem of accelerated fading at high temperature is effectively alleviated, in conjunction with significant (up to 50%) improvement in power performance, by embedding conductive TiC nanoparticles within the PPy layer via co-electroplating. With addition of 1.7\u00a0wt.% of TiC in the composite electrode, the capacitance retains 92% of its initial capacitance under the same cycling condition (40\u00a0\u00b0C, 10,000\u00a0cycles).

     "abstract": "In the course of experiments that included Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) on cation exchange at benzoquinone sulfonate chemisorbed on a Pd(111) electrode, it was found that, whereas the AES spectra remained invariant as the counter cation was varied from H+ to K+ to Cs+, profound changes occurred in the HREELS spectra. Specifically, the intensity of the spectral features decreased noticeably when H+ was replaced with K+. And, when the K+ ions were exchanged with Cs+, nothing but a flat-line (dead) spectrum was observed; even the elastic peak was completely attenuated. When the Cs+ ions were displaced by protons, the initial undiminished spectrum was fully restored. This outcome, while unrelated to cation-exchange selectivity, is of exceptional significance in surface electron spectroscopy. It appears that the positive ions on the surface attracted the low-energy incident electrons such that backscattering towards the energy analyzer was hindered; partially by K+ but totally by the larger Cs+ ion. The use of HREELS to examine the molecular integrity of chemisorbed anionic species must thus take cognizance of the possibility that the counter cation chosen to preserve interfacial-layer electroneutrality can have a profound effect. To circumvent such complication, low-valent and small-radii cations will have to be employed. In addition, although subject to instrument limitations, higher incident-electron energies could be adopted. AES, with incident-electron energies in the kV range, is impervious to the presence of counter cations.",

These needles have sufficiently thin tip regions that allow the direct TEM observation of the oxide layers grown on the surface of copper subjected to the electrochemical oxidation in the aqueous solution at nano-scale. The results show that the duplex layers are formed on the copper surface in the alkaline solution during electrochemical polarization and the layer growth follows a sequential order. An impact inner layer consisting of Cu2O is first formed at low anodic potentials, which will be then transformed into CuO when the anodic potentials increase before the occurrence of oxygen evolution. Subsequently, the production of Cu(OH)2 on the top of CuO inner layer leads to the formation of the outer layer. The epitaxial orientation relationship between the inner oxide layer and its adjacent copper matrix is discovered. The outer oxide layer appears porous consisting of nano-crystals. Some nano-crystals are oriented well with the inner layer due to their direct growth from it. The rest randomly-oriented nano-crystals are produced by the dissolution of oxides into the solution forming copper hydroxide particles, which are immediately deposited back to the surface of the copper needle.",

TaqaI is able to specifically cleave only double strand DNA, but not single strand DNA. The hairpin-DNA aptamer probe (Hap), thiolated single strand DNA labeled with biotin group, was immobilized on a gold electrode. In the presence of OTA, Hap bind with OTA to form Hap-OTA G-quadruplex. Meanwhile, the stem of Hap, which contains a TaqaI recognition site, is opened to form single strand and resistant to the cleavage of TaqaI. After reaction with the streptavidin-HRP, the resulting HRP-tagged Hap-OTA can effectively catalyze the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated oxidation of 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine sulfate (TMB), accompanied by a change from colorless to blue in solution color and an increased electrochemical current signal. However, in the absence of OTA, the biotin group of the Hap can be easily cleaved by TaqaI due to the double-stranded stem, which makes the streptavidin-HRP cannot bind with the Hap and increase electrochemical current signal. By employing the above strategy, this DNA biosensor can detect as low as 0.4\u00a0pg/mL OTA with ultrahigh selectivity.",

A thin aluminum layer (d\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0nm) is electrochemically oxidized in one direction in space at remarkable mild conditions (\u0394\u03c6\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0V and aqueous 0.1\u00a0M NaCl). The time-dependency of this process is controlled by very small electrolyte flows inside the layer structure, the velocities of which are on the order of a few femtoliters to several hundred attoliters per second. The observed optical self-writing effect, which results from a sharp opaque-to-clear transition of the oxidized layer, allows arbitrary optical information to be displayed over time. Because the system works in a self-consuming mode without any external power source, it may provide the basis for a new kind of smart labeling system with time-dependent display functions.",

Finite element method (FEM) structural analysis was used to estimate the degree of strain on the surface, and the open circuit potential was measured in order to investigate the surface electrochemical properties. The analysis suggested that the surface of the wafer was under tensile strain, and the open circuit potential shifted toward the negative direction with the strain. This indicates that mechanical stress applied to a Si surface can change its electronic properties by changing the surface crystal structure.",

CuSCN preparation in the form of nanowires depends on the chelating agent in the electrolyte and could be precisely controlled by the applied potential or the applied current density.

It is attributed to the combined effect of the dislocation generation and deformation-induced martensitic decomposition of austenite during the loading in the transient range from elastic to plastic stress. This result indicates clearly that hydrogen atoms trapped initially in austenite matrix become mobile hydrogen atoms which can easily diffuse in transformed-martensite by the additional loading to plastic range.

In this paper, we report a simple but efficient electrochemical method to assay the reversal effect on MDR by using limonin as reversal agent and multi-drug resistant leukemia cells K562/ADM as target cells. The strategy is based on the over-expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in K562/ADM cells that may promote the efflux of the intracellular anticancer drug kaempferol. Consequently, kaempferol molecules accumulate outside the cells. They then adsorb onto the surface of the working electrode, which is modified by \u03b2-cyclodextrin/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (\u03b2-CD/MWCNTs), to give a well-defined electrochemical response. However, after K562/ADM cells have been incubated with the P-gp inhibitor limonin, efflux of the intracellular anticancer drug molecules will be prohibited, so the peak currents can be observed to decrease in a limonin concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, the proposed method in this work can efficiently characterize the reversal effect of limonin on MDR, which might have potential use in screening the reversal agents for cancer treatments in the future.",

While over a wide range of conditions more or less compact Fe3O4/Fe2O3 layers are obtained, at 600\u00a0\u00b0C rapid growth (several micrometer per hour) of highly crystalline hematite nanowires can be observed. Visible light photocurrent measurements in 1\u00a0M NaOH under AM 1.5 100\u00a0mW/cm2 conditions show that photocurrent density and the onset potential for water oxidation strongly shifted in the cathodic direction for the nanowire morphology. The results indicate that a simple air oxidation of iron can provide a rapid path to form hematite nanowires. Obtained layers are considerably active as photoanodes for solar water splitting.",

This happens at lower potentials than oxidation into titanium dioxide. Hence, titanium oxynitride free from TiO2 may be synthesized.

Then, once formed, the oxynitride can be fully oxidized, to give the dioxide. Measurements of charges associated to voltammetric peaks corroborate this mechanism.",

In addition, variations in electrolyte viscosity are observed to have a significant impact on the direction and magnitude of species crossover during VRFB operation.

It thus reveals that the solvent swelling presents negligible effect on the electron hopping dynamics and that the electron transfer is most likely limited by the diffusive redistribution of the counterions in order to keep the local electroneutrality.",

It is shown here that 7 separate oxidation peaks emerged over relatively long periods of time when a larger range of set potentials was used to acclimate electroactive biofilms. The potentials of oxidation peaks obtained with G. sulfurreducens biofilms acclimated at 0.60\u00a0V (vs. Ag/AgCl) were different from those that developed at \u2212\u00a00.46\u00a0V, and both of their peaks were different from those obtained for biofilms incubated at \u2212\u00a00.30\u00a0V, 0\u00a0V, and 0.30\u00a0V.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to investigate its dynamics, as they might exhibit a competitional behaviour with respect to the later adsorption of organic SAM's. In this study, the adsorption of the ethanol solvent on aluminium oxides is monitored. Due to the dynamic behaviour of the investigated system, odd random phase multisine electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been employed (ORP EIS). A model was developed and statistically proven to be correct. The adsorption of ethanol molecules to form ethoxides on the surface was shown. Because of this reaction, hydroxyl groups of the oxide are being consumed, leading to changes in the oxide layer capacitance. This approach enables us to perform well founded studies of the adsorption of organic SAM's on oxides, as the influence of the solvent on the bare material is fully explored and known.",

This behavior suggests that the main electrode reaction is the cathodic charge of GC (allowing the formation of a poly-nucleophilic species) followed by its reaction with electrophilic CO2 species. A dense poly-carboxylation of the material is confirmed by its derivatization with organic electrophiles (formation of redox-marked esters).

The photoelectrochemical platform was fabricated by simply coating the surface-unpassivated CdTe quantum dots (QDs) on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). When QDs were excited by light with the wavelength of 405\u00a0nm, the charge separations were generated, and then some electrons transformed to O2 to produce O2\u2212, leading to the photocurrent. Electron donors, whose energy level lies between the conduction band and valance band of QDs, could inhibit the charge recombination so that the photoelectric conversion efficiency is enhanced. Based on the recombination suppression, a new photoelectrochemical strategy was developed for the selective detection of dopamine.

As a result an increase in voltammetric peak current of ferroceneacetate anion by circa 30% was seen; this was due to an increase in real electrode area. Further increase, to 62%, took place after the application of a relatively low (3.4\u00a0mT or 34\u00a0Gs) magnetic field, and finally, in all following scans, starting from the second one, the voltammetric peaks were higher by 165% compared to those for the bare electrode. The latter effect was caused by the interactions between the paramagnetic molecules and the non-uniform magnetic field. The magnetic effect was found to depend on the concentration of electroactive species.",

The C-MoS2 nanorods are prepared using MoO3 nanorods as the precursor via a sulfidation and subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of an amorphous carbon layer. When evaluated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the C-MoS2 nanorods exhibit improved reversibility and cycling performance compared with the bare MoS2 nanorods. A high capacity of 621\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01 can be retained after 80\u00a0cycles at a current density of 200\u00a0mA\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01. The rate capability of the C-MoS2 nanorods is also improved. The carbon layer is believed to better retain the structure upon prolonged cycling and to improve the conductivity of the material.

Under AM 1.5 illumination of 100\u00a0mW\u00b7cm\u2212\u00a02, up to 3.82% of light-to-electricity conversion efficiency has been achieved, higher than the reported results of PbS/CdS QDSCs so far. The effects of PbS SILAR cycles, CdS deposition time and film thickness on cell performance were investigated. Furthermore, comparison between this photoanode with large spherical voids and conventional photoanode with large size TiO2 scattering layer was carried out. This kind of photoanode can provide good scattering ability and large surface area, which is suitable for QDs efficient deposition and electrolyte penetration, exhibiting potential application in highly efficient QDSCs especially with high photocurrent.",

Microelectrode array cell specifically designed for investigation of inhibition processes on multi-material galvanic couples was applied for the first time utilising scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) as method of galvanic current quantification.

In this temperature range, CO spontaneously reacts with bulk hydroxide anion to generate soluble formate, which electrooxidation is apparently more facile than the CO electrooxidation. A pathway involving the formate intermediate therefore results in accelerated CO electrooxidation. The corresponding voltammetric behaviors are characteristic of: (i) low onset potentials falling within the hydrogen zone, (ii) maximized oxidation currents in the double-layer zone and (iii) the oxidation inhibition in the oxide zone. These observations are quite different from the literature results for the CO electrooxidation in low temperature alkaline media. This fact provides fundamentals for the development of novel fuel cell and hydrogen purification technologies since CO can be oxidized at very low potentials in the intermediate temperature alkaline media.",

Herein, we report a novel approach to increase extracellular electron transfer between bacteria and anodes, thus enormously enhancing the bioelectricity output in MFCs. We find that the abolishment of the lactate synthesis pathway increases intracellular releasable electrons, which are subsequently transferred to the anode via a secreted diffusive electron shuttle. Thereby, such genetically modified strain delivers a much higher and more stable electricity output than its parental strain in MFCs.",

     "abstract": "Utilization of waste heat has attracted increasing attentions due to energy crisis and environmental problems. Efficiency of traditional thermodynamic cycles for waste heat conversion is limited by the temperature of heat sources. We propose here the concept of a novel waste heat conversion system, namely a thermal-driven electrochemical generator (TDEG), which comprises a reverse electrodialysis (RED) stack and a distillation column. By using thermally instable ammonium bicarbonate solutions as working fluids, waste heat can be converted to electricity. The feasibility of NH4HCO3 to generate electricity for TDEG was validated in a RED stack for the first time. Two important operating conditions influencing power output of RED stack, i.e. concentration of low concentration solution and flow rate of feed solutions were optimized to be 0.02\u00a0M and 800\u00a0mL/min, respectively. A maximum power density of 0.33\u00a0W/m2 was obtained for the specific RED stack. Ionic flux efficiency and energy efficiency under the optimal condition were 88% and 31%, respectively. The study lays a foundation for the establishment of the promising TDEG.",

     "abstract": "This communication describes the first demonstration on the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Copper (II) benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (Cu-BTC, BTC\u00a0=\u00a01,3,5-tricarboxylate) was first synthesized and studied with respect to its electrocatalytic activity toward ORR. However, this kind of widely studied Cu(II)-based MOF was structurally unstable in aqueous media. We thus synthesized one kind of water-stable Cu(II)-based MOF, i.e., copper (II)-2,2\u2032-bipyridine-benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (Cu-bipy-BTC, bipy\u00a0=\u00a02,2\u2032-bipyridine) as an alternative to Cu-BTC for the ORR study. In a phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), the synthetic Cu-bipy-BTC shows a couple of well-defined redox peaks at ca. \u2212\u00a00.15\u00a0V. The presence of O2 into the buffer clearly increases the reduction peak current, while decreases the reversed oxidation peak current of the redox wave. This property, along with the positive shift of the potential for ORR at the MOF-modified electrode compared with that at the bare GC electrode, demonstrates the electrocatalytic activity of the Cu-bipy-BTC MOF towards ORR. Rotating ring-disk electrode voltammetry reveals that this kind of MOF can catalyze the ORR through an almost four-electron reduction pathway. This study essentially offers a new approach to development of non-platinum ORR catalysts based on MOF materials.",

The Lewis acidity of oxidized PEDOT allows electrodeposition of PDAAQ within this matrix without adding a protic acid. The negative charge-storage ability is a function of redox-assisted hydrogen bonding within the composite. This is due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the quinone groups of PDAAQ and the oxidized PEDOT. The material obtained displays good stability in oxygen-free acetonitrile.

The voltammetric response of azurin vanishes irreversibly at temperatures close to 60\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas the redox properties of plastocyanin remain unaltered, except for some loss of electroactive protein, after heating the electrode at temperatures as high as 90\u00a0\u00b0C.",

The sensor is fabricated on highly ordered and vertically aligned TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) employing p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene (CA) as recognition element and visible-light sensitizer. It shows excellent selectivity towards PFF, and 100-fold excess of coexistent interferences only causes minor changes of the photocurrent of PFF.

By applying different potentials, different logic operations were achieved from the system, including XOR, AND-OR and OR-AND. The formation of a bacterial biofilm allowed the stability and scalability of this system, which may find applications in monitoring and controlling of wastewater treatment, bioelectricity generation, and bioremediation process.",

The present study shows that an increase in the CaCl2 concentration to up to 100\u00a0mM led to an increase in the maximal catalytic current generated by two different Ascomycete and one Basidiomycete CDH immobilised on a spectroscopic graphite electrode. For the Ascomycete Myriococcum thermophilum CDH the catalytic current was increased 5.1 fold, whereas Ascomycete Humicola insolens CDH showed a four-fold increase and Basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium CDH showed an increase by a factor of 2.4. On the other hand, the addition of a monovalent cation salt, KCl (up to 100\u00a0mM), to the buffers increased the catalytic currents only up to 2-fold for Myriococcum thermophilum CDH. Activity assays in solution with cyt c accepting solely the electrons from the CYTCDH domain also revealed an increased activity in the presence of CaCl2. Experiments with the isolated DHCDH domain from Humicola insolens have shown that the catalytic turnover is totally independent on the addition of KCl or CaCl2 to the solution. The results indicate a positive effect of metal cations, particularly Ca2\u00a0+, on the electron transfer between the DHCDH and the CYTCDH domains or between the CYTCDH domain and the final electron acceptor, whereas the first hypothesis is favoured. These findings are of interest both for the construction of 3\u00a0rd generation biosensors and biofuel cell anodes, and also for a deeper understanding of the electron transfer mechanism in CDH.",

It was already demonstrated in previous works that surfactants have unfavourable effect on the electrochemistry of graphene. Here for the first time we studied the effect of the surfactant using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as detection technique. The impedimetric response of a multi layered graphene structure was studied in the presence and in the absence of bile salt sodium cholate. The study was also extended to other graphenes (various mixtures of single and few layer graphenes) in order to see the influence of the surfactant on the different number of layers. We believe that our findings have important implications for future works using impedimetric detection on graphene surfaces.",

The polyelectrolyte is modeled as a charged porous sphere and the full nonlinear Poisson\u2013Boltzmann equation is used to describe the interaction between the counterions in the electrolyte solution and the backbone macroion of the polyelectrolyte itself. The solution is obtained with a pseudo-spectral method based on Chebyshev polynomials.The fraction of total charges condensed is analyzed in particular, with its dependence on the charged condition of the polyelectrolyte as well as the ionic strength of the solution investigated in detail. Comparison with limited experimental data available in the literature for DNA neutralization fraction is excellent in the asymptotic sense, suggesting the reliability of the analysis in this study, as well as the promising possibility of using the charged porous sphere to model a polyelectrolyte.

     "abstract": "With the goal to improve the capacitance in electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) many studies on pore size/ion size relationship have been undertaken to achieve a better understanding of the charge storage mechanism in the electrochemical double-layer in confinement. A significant capacitance increase was achieved by using carbon electrodes with micropores (<\u00a01\u00a0nm), when the carbon pore size was close to the ion size. In this paper, the accessibility of narrow pores is investigated by selecting a carbon with a small pore size (<\u00a00.7\u00a0nm) and electrolyte mixtures with different ion sizes. It has been shown that the adsorption capacitance limitation observed for large cations and anions could be overcome by adding ions with a smaller effective size. This result demonstrates that the pores are accessible when their size matches the effective ion size and contradicts the surface saturation assumption; effective ion size which exceeds the pore size leads to current limitation. This work confirms that the steric effect is involved when ions are adsorbed into pores and highlights the importance of controlling ion size/pore size relationship for optimisation of the capacitive performance of EDLC devices.",

A special cell is employed, where the two parallel channels of the cathode flow field can be operated at different pressure. For isobaric operation of the channels (\u0394p\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0mbar), the lateral current density distribution shows a distinct minimum in the land area between the channels as diffusive mass transport becomes limiting at a higher cell polarization. Toward higher \u0394p, the local cell performance in the land area improves initially as a result of an improving convective channel-to-channel mass flow. However, as the pressure difference exceeds a value of 10\u00a0mbar, no noteworthy additional benefit is observed with further increasing \u0394p. Under these conditions, the convective mass flow provides an abundant reactant supply in the land area and, since reactant depletion is no longer limiting, the lateral current density distribution is primarily governed by the local ohmic resistance. As a result, the current density exhibits a maximum in the land area, where the local ohmic resistance shows a minimum.",

This Lewis basicity not only negatively shifted the flat band, but also coordinated Li ions in the electrolyte. As a result, by introducing a quasi-solid-state electrolyte, the open circuit voltage increased by 50\u00a0mV and the photon-to-current efficiency was comparable to a conventional liquid electrolyte. Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs exhibited enhanced long-term stability, maintaining 97% of initial efficiency after 7\u00a0d under a mild acceleration condition at 50\u00a0\u00b0C.",

At 700\u00a0\u00b0C, the equimolar NaCl\u2013KCl enabled highly efficient transport of the S2\u2212 ion and high speed electro-reduction of porous WS2 pellets to W nanonodules (50\u2013100\u00a0nm). The graphite anode was experimentally confirmed to be an ideal non-consumable anode, on which the S2\u2212 ion was oxidised to gaseous sulfur. The current efficiency of the electrolysis of WS2 was higher than 90% and the energy consumption could be lower than 1.23\u00a0kWh/kg-W. These findings promise new green methods for the preparation of various transition metals and alloys by electro-desufidation of their solid sulfides.",

The treated TiO2 nanotubes exhibited a 15-fold enhancement in photocurrent and a 6.8-fold increase in the photoelectrochemical degradation of 4-nitrophenol, significant for hydrogen generation and wastewater treatment.",

Through covalent coupling of the amine end groups with carboxyl functionalized CNTs, a dense forest of vertically aligned CNTs was produced. To these a 30\u00a0nm thick insulating polystyrene layer was spin coated, resulting in exposure of the uppermost carbon nanotube ends. The electrochemical performance of each electrode was then determined using the redox probe ruthenium hexaamine. Once surrounded by polymer, the double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs) showed an improved electron transfer rate, compared to the single-walled electrode. This improvement was attributed to the protection of the electronic properties of the inner wall of the DWCNT during the chemical modification and suggests that DWCNTs may offer a useful alternative to SWCNTs in future electrochemical sensors and biosensors.",

As a practical consequence, the structure of the supporting layer and the catalyst loading should be optimized so that the maximum catalyst utilization is obtained.

One commonly used approach for mitigation is the periodic dosing of caustic to the sewer. This creates elevated pH levels that inactivate/kill sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) present in the biofilms on the sewer pipe. In this study, we investigated the in-situ electrochemical generation of caustic from sewage. The average coulombic efficiency for caustic generation was 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08% (n\u00a0=\u00a010) at a current density of 10\u00a0mA/cm2. The average required cell voltage input was 5.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0V. Over time, this voltage increased due to a membrane fouling associated increase of the ohmic resistance of the cell. Switching the polarity of the electrodes every four hours was effective to control this fouling and thus retain a stable voltage requirement. This process constitutes a promising reagent-free method for sulfide abatement in sewers.",

A decrease of particle size from the micrometer to the nanometer domain provides a higher surface area to volume ratio, and opportunity to facilitate charge transfer, and improve the power, voltage and depth of discharge of cathodes made from such salts. However, super-iron salts are fragile, readily reduced to the ferric state, with both heat and contact with water, and little is known of the resultant passivating and non-passivating ferric oxide products. A pathway to decrease the super-iron particle size to the nano-domain is introduced, which overcomes this fragility, and retains the battery capacity advantage of their Fe(VI) valence state. Time and power controlled mechanosynthesis, through less aggressive, dry ball milling, leads to facile charge transfer of super-iron nanoparticles.

     "abstract": "In this communication, a high performance heteronanostructured electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation, Pt decorating PdCo nanoparticles supported on pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Pt1-Pd3Co1/P-MWCNTs), is successfully prepared via a two-step strategy. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements demonstrate that the as-prepared Pt1-Pd3Co1/P-MWCNTs catalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation compared with commercial 20% Pt/C and Pt/P-MWCNTs catalysts. Furthermore, the mass activity of the as-prepared Pt1-Pd3Co1/P-MWCNTs catalyst is about 3 times of that of the Pt/P-MWCNTs catalyst. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability could be attributed to the synergistic effect between Pt and PdCo, resulting in the higher utilization efficiency of Pt. Because of its relatively low-cost and high performance, the as-prepared Pt1-Pd3Co1/P-MWCNTs catalyst might be an economically viable alternative for methanol oxidation.",

In the presence of electrophilic organic species such as organic halides, surface modification(s) may be obtained. These processes are expected to correspond to nucleophilic substitution (SN). While primary alkyl halides were reported to be easily fixed onto carbon in common polar aprotic solvents, secondary (and tertiary) alkyl halides were noticed to be not reactive under such conditions. Contrariwise, aprotic solvents with high dielectric constant (like propylene carbonate) permit to boost the interfacial reactivity of those halides. Thus, secondary bromides and iodides lead to compact deposits possessing tertiary protons identified by a two-electron oxidation step at about +\u00a01.2\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl. Specifically, 2-bromoadamantane yields an organic layer assigned to grafted 2-adamantyl moiety. The chemical versatility of such deposits is presented.",

The method is based on the oxidation of tetrabutylammonium ferroceneacetate in acetonitrile on glassy carbon electrodes. It is shown that covalent modification of glassy carbon surfaces is possible through a self-mediated electron transfer process. The first step of the mechanism consists in the oxidation of the ferrocene moiety to give rise to a transient ferroceniumacetate zwitterion, which, depending on the concentration, decomposes by either an intramolecular or an intermolecular electron transfer reaction where the carboxylate functional group is oxidized while the ferrocenium group is reduced. As a result of this reaction, carbon dioxide and ferrocenylmethyl radical are formed. In the forthcoming step, this radical reacts with the carbon surface, a reaction which is evidenced by the well behaved oxidation wave of adsorbed ferrocene in a solution containing only the solvent and the supporting electrolyte. Another interesting feature of the process is the fact that the ferrocene layer does not inhibit the electrode surface but this one acts as a surface redox catalyst of the oxidation and decarboxylation processes.",

Unlike the negatively-charged hydrolysis probe, the released e-tagged mono- or short-nucleotide, because of the less extent of electrostatic repulsion with a negatively charged substrate surface, would diffuse freely to the negatively charged electrode (e.g. indium tin oxide) contributing to an increase of electrochemical signal. Experimental investigations demonstrate the cycle-by-cycle electrochemical signal enhancement. This new ERT-PCR method provides higher specificity and multiplexing capability and is a significant advancement towards the application of ERT-PCR in portable DNA-analysis.",

     "abstract": "In this report, we investigated and characterized the effect of organic-based supporting matrix, using functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs), toward enhancement of ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) on Pt-based catalysts. We exploited amine and carboxylic groups since they could induce water adsorption via hydrogen bonding, creating -OHads for further oxidation of toxic intermediates. The results showed that the COOH-MWCNTs supported Pt/MWCNTs enhanced the kinetics of EOR approximately three times more than NH2-R-MWCNTs and the bare Pt/MWCNTs, in terms of oxidation current density and stability. Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra at different bias potentials showed that f-MWCNTs decreases the adsorption of intermediates species on Pt active surface by creating an \u201cOH-carpet\u201d, and also enhances the charge-transfer kinetic during the EOR. The carboxylic f-MWCNTs supporting matrix performed best. Following this initial study, further improvement in EOR kinetics such as optimizing the functionalization of NTs could be achieved, towards a viable utilization of a direct ethanol fuel cell.",

The carbon cloth GDLs with the cracked MPL were used and each layer of the PEMFC and the crack on the MPL were clearly visualized. The results clearly showed that the liquid water mainly flows through the crack on the MPL to the substrate layer, and no liquid water was observed in the MPL. Because the MPL is highly hydrophobic, the MPL can limit the liquid water access to the substrate layer. On the other hand, liquid water tends to be stored in the interface between the CL and the MPL. These results suggest that the larger pores (e.g. cracks) on the MPL function as the liquid water pathway to the substrate layer, and the smaller pores on the MPL function as the gas transport path, and the surface morphology of the MPL might affect the liquid water transport in the PEMFC.",

As a demonstration, a solid electrolyte gas sensor is modeled. This simulated gas sensor calculates EMF in response to a changing level of an active gas in the bulk gas phase.",

Dissolved oxygen content was measured, confirming that the photostimulated process was water oxidation to oxygen. The PTTh electrode also showed photoconductivity under illumination, but its contribution was negligible in the photoelectrocatalytic experiment.

It is proposed that CO adsorption onto these surfaces is a random process, and after CO adsorption there is no appreciable shift from CO-(111) to CO-(110) sites. This implies that after adsorption, CO molecules either have a very long residence time, or that the diffusion coefficient is much lower than previously thought. After CO electrooxidation the sites released included both terrace (111) and step (110) orientations.

This deviation is shown to be caused by the incomplete description of the electrochemical double layers within the cell when calculating the OCV using the Nernst equation adopted from fuel cell literature. Here, we propose a more complete description of the Nernst equation, which accounts for two additional electrochemical mechanisms that exist in a VRFB, namely: i) the proton activity at the positive electrode due to the involvement of the protons in the redox reaction, and ii) the Donnan potential due to the proton concentration differences across the membrane. The complete form of the Nernst equation proposed herein accurately predicts the reported experimental data with an average error of 1.2%, showing a significant improvement over the incomplete Nernst equation (8.1% average error) currently used in VRFB models.",

These large zones of sp2 carbons can be transformed under electrochemical charge into nucleophilic belts for reacting towards RXs via a kind of heterogeneous SN2.

Nevertheless, the probe ssDNA will inhibit the electron transfer between the electrochemical active species [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- and the electrode after the probe molecules are strongly bound to the surface of the modified electrode via their interaction with graphene. However, when the target molecules such as target ssDNA or target protein also exist in the test solution, the probe ssDNA will bind with the target instead of graphene if the sequence of the probe ssDNA is designed as complementary to the target DNA or as the aptamer of the target protein. As a result, the obtained peak currents of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- will increase with the target molecules, thus various electrochemical biosensors can be easily developed with this proposed platform.

Thus, active chlorine effectively removes ammonia from an acidic solution, while the formation of by-products such as chlorate and possibly perchlorate is minimized.",

Pitting is much more easily observed after the specimen has been pre-charged with hydrogen, for the oxidation of the hydrogen in the X70 decreases the pH value at the X70/solution interface, which retards the formation of an oxide film and subsequently promotes the pitting processes.

TEM and XPS analyses confirm the formation of nanoparticles and the presence of transition metal oxides. Rotating disk electrode measurements showed that the as-synthesized materials exhibit catalytic ORR activity in acidic medium toward oxygen reduction, which is higher than that of cobalt porphyrin on carbon. This reveals that the metal oxide nanoparticles enhance the activity of the metalloporphyrin without being electroactive themselves. The catalytic activity follows the sequence: CoOx\u2013CoP/C\u00a0>\u00a0NiOx\u2013CoP/C\u00a0>\u00a0FeOx\u2013CoP/C, showing the influence of nature of the transition metal on the enhancing effect.

CdSe/ZnO nanowires were formed in all directions over the Cu wire, leading to low incident-light-angle dependence. For photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation under one-sun irradiation, the wire-shaped electrode device outperformed the planar-shaped electrode device by at least 30%.",

THD simulations by means of different methanol oxidation kinetics as well as its experimental validation are both carried out. It is shown that the THD model adopting a three-step methanol oxidation mechanism with Kauranen\u2013Frumkin/Temkin kinetics can be used to illustrate the THD variation for DMFC anode qualitatively. The experimental THD response at the frequency range from 0.063\u00a0Hz to 0.4\u00a0Hz is identified as the reflection of the nonlinearity variation of those kinetic steps involving intermediates in the methanol oxidation. In such a frequency domain, THD value decrease monotonously with decreasing methanol concentration, which notices its accessibility on methanol concentration detection.",

Li/IE-LNMO cells demonstrate very stable reversible capacities of 220\u00a0mAh/g @ 15\u00a0mA/g and possess extremely high power of 150\u00a0mAh/g @ 1500\u00a0mA/g (15C). The Li/IE-LNMO cell dQ/dV plot exhibits three reversible electrochemical processes due to Ni/Mn redox behavior in a layered component, and Mn redox exchange in a spinel component. No alteration in the dQ/dV curves and no detectable change in the voltage profiles over 40\u00a0cycles were observed, thus indicating a stable structure for lithium insertion/extraction. This new material is attractive for demanding Li-ion battery applications.",

Sensors were developed by modifying glassy carbon (GC) electrodes with GO, crGO and dG and ascorbic acid was used as a pilot analyte. GC/GO electrodes offer substantially lower oxidation overpotential, up to 350\u00a0mV, compared with GC/crGO, GC/dG and unmodified GC electrodes. In addition, the different carbon-to-oxygen atomic ratios in GO, as it occurs depending on the synthetic route, were found to have a remarkable effect on the performance of the sensors. Reduction of GO was achieved by immersing the modified electrodes into a stirred solution of NaBH4 for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. This process was used alternatively of the time consuming and laborious process of hydrazine, and its effectiveness was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Analytical utility of the sensors is demonstrated.",

Oscillations of CO oxidation rate showed a perfect correlation with those of the electrochemical potential values. Electrochemical promotion of catalysis was used to initiate and stop the oscillatory behaviour. Small current application induced a permanent effect on the oscillatory behaviours. An extremely small negative current (\u2212\u00a017\u00a0\u03bcA) led to a 4-fold increase of the catalytic activity and created oscillations that were stable even after current interruption. This permanent effect in the oscillatory behaviour of CO oxidation rate is observed for the first time using EPOC.

Based on the growing diazonium chemistry, we synthesized the diazonium salt of the well-known NADH mediator toluidine blue O. The electrochemical reduction of the diazonium moiety by cyclic voltammetry onto a screen-printed electrode leads to an electrocatalyst suitable for the oxidation of NADH. The amperometric response for its oxidation shows a maximal current of 1.2\u00a0\u03bcA ([NADH]\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0\u03bcM). Based on electrochemical measurements, the surface coverage is found to be 3.78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a011\u00a0mol cm\u2212\u00a02 and the heterogeneous standard rate constant kh is 1.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01. The sensitive layer for the oxidation of NADH is improved by electrografting the diazonium salt with a potentiostatic method.

This functionalisation has been performed by grafting aminophenyl (AP) via an electrochemical reduction of 4-aminophenyldiazonium salt in acetonitrile solution and the subsequent chemical binding of N-(2-carboxyethyl) maleimide (NCEM). The resulting maleimide functionalised surface was interacted with a cysteine-modified peptide. The grafting of AP was monitored by the occurrence of NH2 and aryl ring vibrations, whereas the binding of the NCEM led to a strong and sharp peak because of the C\u2550O stretching mode. The immobilisation of the peptide was identified by the appearance of the amide I band. Half of the maleimide surface groups reacted with the peptide because of steric hindrance. The charge efficiency for the AP layer formation was about 45% at a thickness of about 6\u20138\u00a0nm.",

     "abstract": "Pathogenic bacteria secrete various virulence factors that can directly interact with the outer lipid bilayer membrane of eukaryotic cells, inducing cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. Such virulence factors account for much of the toxic action associated with bacterial infection; therefore the detection of such proteins could provide a methodology for sensing/detection of pathogenic bacteria in, for example, food or human tissue. Detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria by conventional methods such as plating and counting in laboratory is expensive and time consuming. With growing concerns over emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic bacteria with high resistant to current antibiotics, there is a potential need for effective detection of pathogenic toxins in-vitro. This paper presents the application of tethered bilayer lipid membrane (TBLM) as a sensing platform for the detection of the clinically relevant pathogenic bacterial, Staphylococcus aureus MSSA 476 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 via their secreted virulence factors, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A non-pathogenic strain of bacteria, E. coli DH5\u03b1 was used as a control. A clear difference in the impedance of the TBLM for the pathogenic vs. non-pathogenic species was observed.",

Our experimental approach consists of measuring in-situ the internal stress in anodic oxide films grown galvanostatically on aluminium in phosphoric acid, and to correlate these data with the measured pore spacing of the obtained porous films. Our results indicate that the possibility of a strain energy-induced surface instability is unlikely, as for this case the constitutive dependence of pore spacing on internal stress was not verified. Instead, the measured pore spacing, electric field and barrier oxide thickness obtained on our anodic alumina films indicate that electrostatic energy is the main driving force for pore initiation, as well as the factor controlling the pore spacing.

The coulometric cell is composed of a porous polypropylene tube doped with a liquid calcium-selective membrane and a silver/silver chloride wire as an inner electrode, forming a thin layer sample between wire and tubing. The total charge passed through the system during potential controlled electrolysis of the thin layer sample is indeed found to be proportional to the amount of calcium present, but non-Faradaic processes do contribute to the obtained signal. We introduce here a multi-pulse procedure that allows one to perform a second excitation pulse at the same excitation potential after exhaustive ion transfer voltammetry of calcium has taken place. The intercept of the calibration curve after background subtraction is found as 20.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0\u03bcC, significantly lower than the value of 54.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0\u03bcC for the uncorrected curve.

Two electrolyte concentrations as well as three different pulse durations were assessed. The resulting films were compared with those deposited at fixed electrode potentials. As-grown films are nanocrystalline and have an Eg \u223c\u00a00.95\u00a0eV. Raman spectroscopy shows that Se and Cu\u2013Se contents decrease while pulse duration increases and electrolyte concentration decreases. Cu\u2013Se phases are even absent for films grown at the low electrolyte concentration. These results represent a great improvement in the film phase purity reducing the need of post-deposition treatments.",

     "abstract": "Genotyping technologies need to tackle issues of cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and mutiplexability to meet the ever-increasing demands for clinical diagnostics, addressing the future medical paradigm. Here we report on a facile method for the rapid detection of mutations using electrochemical melting-curve analysis. The concept is based on the use of an immobilised probe hybridised to the mutant region of a ferrocene labelled amplicon. Following hybridisation, the temperature is ramped and the dissociation of the ferrocene labelled DNA from the electrode surface is monitored using differential pulse voltammetry. Using a model system consisting of short probe and target, the proposed approach was demonstrated to clearly discriminate between complementary and mismatch duplexes. The melting temperature of the surface confined DNA duplex was observed to be markedly lower than that obtained in solution, with melting temperatures of 38 and 59\u00a0\u00b0C, observed, respectively. The approach can be extended to array based melting-curve analysis, allowing the simultaneous detection of multiple mutations, as well as for genosensor design.",

In order to perform experiments, a polypyrrole\u2013heteropolyanion doped mediator film was inserted between the working electrode of the microbalance and the hybrid membrane. This mediator film, which is characterized by mixed conducting properties, is necessary to provide proton transfer between the different interfaces and in that way, the proton transport inside the hybrid film which is only an ionic conducting material. Proton transfer and transport was characterized through ac-electrogravimetry and an original theoretical approach was developed for extracting the attractive parameters. The change of the exchanged species concentration and the diffusion coefficient of the protons in the hybrid membrane, were estimated, for the first time, according to the applied potential.

     "publication date": "07-2010",
     "abstract": "One common dilemma encountered in designing a supercapacitor electrode is that the specific capacitance (Cs) of the active material decreases significantly as the active-material loading (mass area\u2212\u00a01) increases. As a result, the geometric capacitance density (GCD; Farad area\u2212\u00a01) of the electrode does not scale up linearly but gradually levels off with increasing loading. For MnO2 supercapacitors, this problem has been solved to a great extent by introducing a superabsorbent polymer (SAP) binder, namely polyacrylic acid (PAA), to form composite particles with MnO2. Other than acting as a binder to bound together MnO2 particles, the SAP is believed to facilitate distribution of electrolyte throughout the active layer owing to its electrolyte-absorbing and swelling behaviors. The Cs of MnO2 remains almost unchanged as the oxide loading varies over a wide range (1.5\u20136.5\u00a0mg cm\u2212\u00a02) of heavy active-material loading. In addition, putting PAA throughout the entire active layer helps to magnify the specific interaction between PAA and MnO2 that is known to enhance the capacitance of individual MnO2 particles. The success in combining both high Cs and high active-material loading results in GCD of ca. 1.8\u20131.4\u00a0F\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02 even under very high current densities (ca. 35\u2013260\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02 or 5\u201340\u00a0A\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01-MnO2).",

Further, the effectiveness of this system was examined by treating an old-aged landfill leachate. 77% of color and 78% of COD were removed from the original leachate, indicating that the pyrrhotite not only acted as a cost-effective cathodic catalyst for MFCs in power generation, but also extended the practical merits of traditional MFCs towards advanced oxidation of biorefractory pollutants.",

Despite Pt catalysts in the cathode being only 0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02, the maximum power density of the improved membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was 120\u00a0mW\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02, at 3\u00a0M methanol, which was much larger than that of traditional MEA (67\u00a0mW\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02).",

The depth of the space charge region (SCR), Schottky barrier on the silicon-electrolyte interface, was adjusted regarding the depth of the micro-cavities by applied overpotential and specific resistance of the silicon wafer. The collection of h+ at the tip of the cavity site was widely controlled by the adjusted SCR. Consequently the electrochemically etched domain at the cavity site was actively tuned, and then high-aspect-ratio pore with the controlled diameter was formed. The diameter was tuned by the SCR depth which was controlled by the overpotential and the specific resistance. The diameter tuning mechanism worked under the mask-free condition.",

     "abstract": "An in situ study of the effects of Na+, Mg2+ and Cr3+ on direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) performance is reported. The result showed that dramatic decrease of the cell voltage was mainly ascribed to the increase of the cathode overpotential. Meanwhile, the different contamination effects by introducing Na+, Mg2+ and Cr3+ to the anode and the cathode were compared. When the same molar concentration of different cations was added to the anode feed, the contamination effect on the cell performance followed the order of Na+\u00a0>\u00a0Mg2+\u00a0>\u00a0Cr3+. Owing to the fast transfer speed and the low affinity to the sulfonic acid groups in the ionomer phase, the low-valent cations may cause much more proton losses than the high-valent cations in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) within the same time. So the low-valent cations led to the higher cathode overpotential than the high-valent cations. When the same molar concentration of cations was directly added to the CCL, the contamination effects on the cell voltage showed an opposite trend which is Na+\u00a0<\u00a0Mg2+\u00a0<\u00a0Cr3+. This is presumably because a high-valent cation can exchange more protons than a low-valent cation in the CCL.",

The cyclic voltammogram showed the presence of two cathodic peaks associated with the deposition of Rh. The analysis of the chronoamperometric curves, according to the existing theories, indicated that the Rh electrodeposition can be explained by a combination of several nucleation processes: two-dimensional (2D) progressive nucleation, which transforms to 2D instantaneous nucleation at more cathodic potentials, followed by three-dimensional (3D) nucleation with diffusion controlled growth. The nucleation kinetic parameters were determined according to these theories.",

It was proved that the dominant reversible sites for lithium storage in empty SWNTs are the trigonal interstitial channels.

The charge\u2013discharge studies in a Li/MCMB (mesocarbon microbeads) cell using electrolyte containing these compounds show that the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation capability of MFPC/DMC (dimethyl carbonate) and TFPC/DMC are about the same as ethylene carbonate (EC)/DMC, and TFPC/PC/DMC is better than that of EC/PC/DMC, while MFPC/PC/DMC is poorer than the EC/PC/DMC. The superior SEI formation capability of TFPC could be attributed to the strong electron withdrawing group of CF3, which promote the \u201cring-opening\u201d reaction. In contrast, the electron donating group CH3 in the PC structure may demote the \u201cring opening\u201d and cause the poor SEI formation.

The retS mutant generated significantly higher current (45-fold) than the WT under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic current generation by the WT was 28-fold higher with extraneously supplied lactones (a QS-signaling molecule). Compared to anaerobic conditions, the WT with some oxygen (microaerobic conditions) exhibited enhanced phenazine production (39-fold) and current levels (48-fold). Iron-rich medium and microaerobic conditions had a negative impact on current generation by retS. All these results were directly linked to QS activity in P. aeruginosa, thus, demonstrating the importance of this bacterial communication system for current generation in BESs.

The pronounced reduction in ohmic resistance might be due to the fully dense structure and thus improved electrical conductivity of the SDC interlayer, increased contact area at the interface between the dense SDC interlayer and the YSZ electrolyte, and suppressed Zr migration into the SDC interlayer.",

To develop a hydrogen evolution cathode that can work at neutral pH remains a major challenge in MEC technology. Voltammetry performed at pH 8.0 on rotating disk electrodes showed that the presence of phosphate species straightforwardly multiplied the current density of hydrogen evolution, through the so-called cathodic deprotonation reaction. The mechanism was stable on stainless steel cathodes whereas it rapidly vanished on platinum. The phosphate/stainless steel system implemented in a 25\u00a0L MEC with a marine microbial anode led to hydrogen evolution rates of up to 4.9\u00a0L/h/m2 under 0.8\u00a0V voltage, which were of the same order than the best performance values reported so far.",

Alternating the etching bias from anodic to cathodic bias enhances the passivation of the pore walls and substrate. The formation of porous multilayers is possible, since the starting layer is not dissolved during the formation of the separation layer.

     "abstract": "In parallel to vacuum tubes, where accelerated electrons are retained by a biased screen, we stop ionic currents in electrolytes by providing a small bias to a permeable electrode placed in the ionic path. In electrolytes, though, the process is far more complex due to the very short screening distances of ions. While the concept is general, we demonstrated the effect in a self-powered system, namely, a wet battery. Graphene \u2013 monolayer, or a few layer thick graphite \u2013 is a good screening electrode since it does not oxidize easily. Two half-cells, Zn electrode immersed in ZnSO4 electrolyte and Cu electrode immersed in CuSO4, respectively, were brought into contact via graphene-coated Teflon filter. A small positive bias between the screening electrode (graphene) and the Cu electrode was sufficient to stop the oxidation\u2013reduction reaction. Such constructions may enable studies of ion tunneling and electronically controlled graphene-coated bio-membranes.",

The catalytic oxidation of C2H4 was studied over a Pt/YSZ/Au electrochemical cell under excess O2 at 375\u00a0\u00b0C, combining cyclic voltammetry and mass spectrometry. It has been found that after positive current interruption, the catalytic rate remains in a highly active P-EPOC steady-state, where it is almost double than the initial open-circuit rate. During this highly active steady-state, the application of a similar negative current for a similar time period has been found to result in the return of the catalytic rate to the initial open-circuit state. Similar reversibility of the rate has been observed after cyclic voltammetry experiments where after a complete potential oscillation the open-circuit rate is almost the same to that before polarization.

Our CMG model shows that from an initial uniform condition two electrodenaturation fronts evolve expanding towards each other until collision. Moreover, electrodenaturation front tracking reveals that the front grows under a diffusion-controlled regime. Based on this evidence it is possible, in principle, to predict the time needed for tumor destruction without compromising healthy tissue. These results are consistent with those previously obtained with in vivo and in vitro EChT modeling. In contrast to previous simpler in vitro models, our CMG model represents a better structural and chemical approximation to a real tissue thus providing a better tool for validation of new in silico EChT models aimed at a more accurate prediction of tissue destruction level.",

In this work, a potentiometric method is devised to monitor ion-exchange properties (or \u2018purity\u2019) of an organic solvent containing a lipophilic electrolyte. Its permselective behaviour is monitored by treating the solvent as a liquid membrane and contacting it with two aqueous solutions with different electrolyte activities. This electrolyte mismatch results in a drastic potential change when excess lipophilic cation-exchanger is titrated with anion-exchanger, altering the membrane from being cation to anion responsive. Here, the cation-exchanger potassium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate (KTpClPB) dissolved in nitrobenzene was titrated with tetradodecylammonium chloride (TDDACl), in contact with Ag/AgCl electrodes placed in aqueous 1\u00a0M and 10\u22122\u00a0M KCl, respectively.

In this work, the electro-oxidation of ethanol on platinum was studied in concentrated phosphoric acid containing different concentrations of water at room temperature. The results show that effect of bulk water on the rate electro-oxidation is highest at 0.60\u00a0V and decreases for increasing potentials. This was suggested as due to the increasing formation of oxygenated species on the electrode surface with potential, which in turn is more efficient than the increase of water content in the electrolyte. Altogether, these results were interpreted as an evidence of a Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood step involving oxygenated species as one of the adsorbed partners.",

     "abstract": "Electrodes modified with carbon nanomaterials find wide ranging applications in electrochemistry such as in energy generation and storage through to applications in electroanalysis. A substantial limitation is the presence of metallic impurities which vary between batches and can produce erroneous results. Consequently we have explored the electrochemical properties of metallic impurity free carbon nanotube paste electrodes using potassium ferrocyanide and hydrogen peroxide as model compounds. In terms of the latter utilising cyclic voltammetry, a linear range from 0.75 to 3\u00a0mM with a limit of detection of 0.19\u00a0mM is possible using the electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen peroxide while using the electrochemical reduction of the target analyte, a linear range from 0.5 to 249\u00a0mM is possible with a detection limit of 0.43\u00a0mM.The ultra-small size of the carbon nanotubes and fabrication methodology result in a tightly bound carbon nanotube electrode surface which does not exhibit thin-layer behaviour resulting in highly reproducible electrodes with the %RSD found to be 5.5%. These analytical ranges, detection limits and reproducibility are technologically useful.The carbon nanotubes utilised are completely free from metallic impurities and do not require lengthy processing to remove impurities and consequently have no variation in the purity of the nanomaterial between batches as is commonly the case for other available carbon nanotube material. The impurity free nature of this nanomaterial allows for highly reproducible and intelligent sensors based on carbon nanotubes to be understood and realised for the first time.",

     "abstract": "Water management is one of the critical issues of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells because dehydration of a membrane increases membrane-resistance whereas excessive water flooding at the cathode impedes the gaseous diffusion of oxygen to reaction sites at the wetted catalyst surface. In this study, we have developed an asymmetric polymer electrolyte membrane that facilitates water management. The structural modification of the membrane strongly affected water management, due primarily to the fact that water must move through the membrane during fuel cell operation. The asymmetric membrane improved transport of water from the cathode to the anode when the hydrophilic side of the membrane located to the cathode, thereby enhancing overall fuel cell performance under both fully humidified and non-humidified conditions.",

The electrolyte type played an important role in determining the formation of uniform nanotube arrays. Through using the glycerol-based electrolytes, phase-dependent anodization effect was greatly minimized at both the \u03b1-phase regions and the \u03b2-phase regions, which makes it possible to grow uniform nanotube arrays on the biphase alloy. The reported anodization method is expected to be useful in fabricating uniformly doped nanotubes on a variety of biphase Ti alloys.",
