     "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the mechanism how the surface of porous TiNi compounds produced by SHS method evolves. The prepared samples were investigated using light-microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicated that the surface of all pores is represented by a granular stratum due to dendrite liquation by peritectic crystallization mechanism. The voids of 2\u201315\u202f\u03bcm in size are formed owing to a capillary spreading of the liquid. Reaction gases with dissociated carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are responsible for heat-and-mass transfer through the forming pores. High pressure-temperature effect of reaction gases on the melt causes the forming voids to coalesce, as well as transfers the peritectic liquid (PL) throughout the open pores catalyzing a distinctive spitted topography. It is through the chemisorption of gasiform nonmetallics by the pore surface melt, where these impurities are chemically bound, that it was formed a massive corrosion-resistant amorphous-nanocrystalline stratified shell deduced as an intermetallic oxycarbonitride layer.",

     "abstract": "Nowadays, the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), a highly prevalent joint disorder, remains a medical challenge because of the lack of understanding of its pathogenesis. In this work, we developed an alternative strategy of OA treatment using magnesium-based materials as potential therapeutic agent towards subchondral bone remodeling. We selected deer antlers as the animal model where calcification behaviors could provide interesting references for the rapid and reproducible endochondral bone growth. Extremely high content of Mg was detected in the antler, which was able to affect the evolutions of biological apatite. Herein, octacalcium phosphate (OCP) and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), which are critically involved in the calcification process, were respectively synthesized under the Mg-containing conditions to understand the role of Mg in the evolution of biological apatite. Results showed that the substitution of Mg2+ at lower contents stabilized OCP and ACP, while higher contents of Mg inhibited the formation of both phases. The size of both calcium phosphates was also altered significantly by the addition of Mg. The results of cell culture indicated that excess Mg notably accelerated the secretion of extracellular matrix and inhibited the mineralization of chondrocyte matrix. Hence, utilization of Mg-based materials in subchondral bone was supposed to provide a potential therapeutic approach to treat the OA by inhibiting subchondral of ossification process.",

     "abstract": "In this research work, the sintering characteristics of Al86Ni6Y4.5Co2La1.5 mechanically alloyed amorphous powders and milled melt spun ribbon have been compared. Mechanically alloyed amorphous powders were synthesized via 200\u202fh high energy ball milling. Melt spun ribbons were synthesized by single roller melt spinning technique and grounded to powder form by ball milling. Mechanically induced partial crystallization occurred in the ribbons during milling. Significantly higher amount of contaminations such as carbon, oxygen and iron were observed in the mechanically alloyed amorphous powders compared to the milled ribbons. Both powders were consolidated via spark plasma sintering. Superior particle bonding was found in the sample consolidated from milled ribbons, ascribed to the lower amount of contamination that could not effectively restrict the viscous flow and diffusion of atoms. Various complex crystalline phases evolved in the sample consolidated from milled ribbon particles due to the presence of crystalline phases in the powders which acted as nucleation sites, whereas the amorphous phase was mostly retained in its counterpart. Vickers microhardness of the consolidated alloys from milled ribbon and mechanically alloyed amorphous powders were 3.60\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13\u202fGPa and 2.53\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09\u202fGPa, respectively. The higher hardness in the former case was attributed to the superior particle bonding and distribution of hard intermetallic phases in the amorphous matrix.",

     "publication date": "04-2019",
     "abstract": "To develop a crystallization technique that can enhance the production of metastable \u03b1-form and unstable \u03b2-form glycine, we studied the antisolvent crystallization of glycine using the gas\u2013liquid interfaces around N2 fine bubbles as novel crystallization fields. In the regions near the gas\u2013liquid interfaces, local supersaturation is generated because of the accumulation of glycine and alcohol as an antisolvent as a result of the negative electric charge on the fine bubble surface. Hence, the produced glycine polymorphs change from the stable \u03b3-form to a \u03b1-form or \u03b2-form glycine. Additionally, local supersaturation at the gas\u2013liquid interfaces can be expected to change via modification of the accumulation of the glycine and alcohol molecules and the interaction of glycine-water-alcohol with the different alcohol additives. At a solution temperature of 303\u202fK, methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), or isopropanol (IPA) as an antisolvent were rapidly mixed into the saturated glycine solution. While mixing MeOH, EtOH, or IPA with the saturated glycine solution, N2 fine bubbles with an average size of 10\u202f\u00b5m were continuously supplied to the mixed solution using a self-supporting bubble generator and a glycine polymorph was crystallized within 5\u202fmin. For comparison, an antisolvent crystallization free of N2 fine bubbles was conducted using a propeller type mixer. During antisolvent crystallization with/without fine bubble injection, the additional alcohol volume was varied to control the generation rate of the supersaturation in the bulk solution (rC/CS). Consequently, the production regions of the \u03b1-form and \u03b2-form glycine were broadened to lower rC/CS via N2 fine bubble injection. The expansion behavior for \u03b1-form or \u03b2-form glycine significantly increased because of the enhancement of local supersaturation at the regions near the gas\u2013liquid interfaces of the N2 fine bubbles owing to the decreasing carbon number in the alcohol.",

Pristine g-C3N4 was prepared via standard thermal polycondensation of urea. Introduction of Cu ions into g-C3N4 polymeric network was performed by treatment of pristine powder by a solution containing tetraammoniumdiaquacopper(II) complex ions followed by annealing. The structure and properties of products were revealed with the aid of XRD, FTIR, UV\u2013Vis and XPS, and complemented by SEM investigation of morphology, pycnometry, BET analysis, and conductivity measurements. The response of prepared ER fluids to an external electric field was examined by rheometry and the effects visualized with optical microscopy. While ER fluids based on g-C3N4 exhibited negative ER effect (decrease in viscosity when the field is switched-on), ER fluids based on a g-C3N4/Cu-doped analogue exhibited positive ER effect. Dielectric spectroscopy using Havriliak-Negami model revealed that introduction of the dopant almost doubled the dielectric relaxation strength while the relaxation time was halved. The ability of g-C3N4/Cu as a candidate for further studies necessary to increase the ER effect was demonstrated. Thereto, described modification of g-C3N4 by copper ions shall be applicable also for other metals forming ammonia complexes.",

The collection and grade efficiencies of the cyclone separator were measured by on-line method for inlet velocities, particle concentration and particle humidity in the ranges of 12\u201318\u202fm/s, 30\u2013500\u202fmg/m3 and 8\u201330\u2030, respectively. By employing a set of fixed parameters for inlet velocity and particle concentration, the effect of particle humidity on separation efficiency was investigated. The experimental results show that the volume ratio of larger particle increases with the increasing of particle humidity due to particle agglomeration. When the inlet velocity and particle humidity remain constant, the collection and grade efficiencies improve greatly as the increasing of the particle concentration because of the particle aggregation. However, it was noticed that the grade efficiencies did not always increased with the increasing of particle humidity under the same conditions of inlet velocity and particle concentration. The trends of grade efficiency curves for different particle humidity change at the particle diameter of approximately 10\u202f\u03bcm. The grade efficiency improves with the increasing of particle humidity when the particle diameter is larger than 10\u202f\u03bcm, while a contrary tendency is observed when the particle diameter is smaller than 10\u202f\u03bcm.",

Appropriate DEM modelling could allow engineers to design solutions that overcome these flow problems. This work shows the application of a DEM calibration framework to produce a realistic, calibrated and efficient material model for lignocellulosic biomass. A coarse (500\u2013710\u202f\u00b5m) and a fine (200\u2013315\u202f\u00b5m) sieving cut of milled poplar were used in this study. The elongated shape and the cohesive behavior were respectively simulated using a coarse-grained multisphere approach and a cohesive SJKR contact model. Measurements of three physical responses (angle-of-repose, bulk density, a retainment ratio) allowed calibration of the sliding (\u00b5s) and rolling friction (\u00b5r) coefficients and the cohesion energy density (CED). Using a statistical analysis, the most influential calibration parameters for each bulk response were identified. A Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm was used to solve the calibration multi-objective optimization problem. Several sets of optimal solutions reproduced accurately the three physical responses and the experimental shear responses were closely reproduced by simulations for the population of coarse particles. The DEM calibration framework studied here aims to produce material models useful for assessing flow behavior and equipment interaction for biomass particles.",

The criterion of the model is achieved by analyzing the particle interaction, relative velocity distribution, and energy transfer in particle collision. The model error mainly originates from by the simplification of the actual system. The developed model is applicable to the case that a droplet completely spreads on the particle surface, that is, the solid\u2013liquid contact angle is less than 40\u00b0.

     "abstract": "Aimed at optimizing the resin-molding process, a method for numerically analyzing aggregation and dispersion behavior of the filler in resin composite was proposed. The flow of a resin composite during molding was calculated by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and particle-size distribution (PSD) of the cluster in each computational domain of the CFD model was estimated by solving the population balance equation (PBE). The proposed numerical-analysis method is based on the thixotropy model of Usui et al. In the thixotropy model, PSD is calculated by taking into account the aggregation and dispersion rate of the cluster by Brownian coagulation, shear coagulation, and shear breakage. Shear-breakage rate of the cluster is evaluated by solving the energy balance of bonding energy of the primary particles cut at the breakage and the drag applied to the cluster by the flow of the fluid. The composite viscosity was calculated using Krieger and Dougherty\u2019s model based on apparent-solid-volume fraction estimated from the calculated PSD. To solve the PBE at low calculation cost, it was discretized using the fixed-pivot technique of Kumar and Ramkrishna. The proposed method was incorporated into the general-purpose CFD software FLOW-3D\u00ae, and its accuracy was proved.",

Behavior of bubbles in beds of polyethylene particles was studied through analysis of pressure fluctuations in the frequency domain. Fluidized beds of uncharged, pre-charged and bed-charged particles were used in the experiments. Results revealed that in the bed of pre-charged particles, compared to uncharged experiments, particle-particle repulsive force increases the bed voidage and reduces equilibrium bubble size while the transition velocity to turbulent fluidization is decreased. In the case of bed-charged particles, at low gas velocities bubble fraction is greater compare to the other cases due to faster bubble coalescence in the presence of particle-wall attractive electrostatic force. Electrostatic charge of bulk increases by increasing the gas velocity. At high gas velocities, the repulsion force between highly charged particles overcomes the particle-wall effect on bubble formation and reduces the bubble size to less than in uncharged experiments. Accumulation of particles near the wall in the bed od bed-charged particles affects the hydrodynamics in two ways: first it accelerates bubble growth via bubble coalescence at low gas velocities, second it limits the bubble growth and reduces the transition velocity to turbulent regime to a value less than for pre-charged particles.",

The pre-deposition of Pt nanoparticles was successfully performed for the surface-modified SiO2 particles since the surface modification possibly strengthened the affinity between the SiO2 particle surfaces and Pt ions. The Pt nanoparticles were pre-deposited more uniformly in the case of PVP because the pre-deposition took place more slowly for the PVP, which provided uniform surface-modification followed by the uniform pre-deposition of Pt nanoparticles. The formation of Pt shells was successfully performed on the SiO2/PVP-Pt particles in the electroless metal plating process because Pt nuclei were generated by the reduction of H2PtCl6 and then further deposited on the Pt particle surfaces on the SiO2/PVP-Pt particles.",

It is shown that both the volume share and the size of the WC particles used as reinforcement of the steel matrix have a significant impact on the densification behaviour as well as the resistance to abrasive wear and corrosion of sintered MMCs based on low-alloy steel.",

The experimental study focuses on the optimum air-velocity and power consumption, and results shows the maximum reduction of the optimum air-velocity and the coefficient of power consumption are approximately 8.2% and 16.4%, respectively. In addition, the CFD-DEM coupled approach is first developed to investigate the interaction of gas-solid flow in terms of the gas turbulent kinetic energy and spatial particle flow characteristics. Compared with the conventional pneumatic conveying, it is found that the optimum air-velocity and power consumption are reduced by the new self-excited oscillatory flow at lower air-velocities. The numerical results show that the approximately symmetric distribution of axial velocity and the intensive tangential velocity is emerged in the self-excited oscillatory flow at upstream. Particles is efficiently dispersed and suspended by the self-exited oscillatory flow reflecting in the smaller particle variation coefficient and the lager particle suspension coefficient. And since the airflow kinetic energy is utilized more fully to promote particles flowing, the spatial particle axial velocity is accelerated and reached early steady state. As a result, the developed numerical model is further explained the mechanism of energy saving with the self-excited oscillatory flow.",

     "abstract": "Preventing health and safety hazards such as dust explosions and respiratory exposure in the work force when handling and storing fine powders is a major challenge faced by plant operators [13]. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) coupled with Discrete Phase Model (DPM) can be used as a tool to address this challenge by advancing the understanding of how particles deposit in a particular process. Particle settling, in air streams, is primarily dependent on the drag forces exerted on the individual particles through interactions with the suspension medium [2]. By improving the understanding of this interaction through repeatable experiments and simulations; more complex CFD \u2013 DPM simulations are possible, thus providing a significant step in reducing the risks associated with handling fine powders. To study the transport and settling of particles in air streams, an experiment was established where glass beads, alumina and iron ore dust were injected into a horizontal flow channel. The material was fed into the top of the test rig where it was then transported in a laminar air stream. Through this method particle settling, according to the particle size, can be observed by sampling different trays along the bottom of the test rig. Once the deposition of particles is analysed (using a particle size analyser) each diameter range can be tracked to determine the distance travelled. After evaluating these experiments a CFD coupled with DPM simulation was employed to predict particle deposition in the horizontal chamber. The results show a good agreement between experiments and CFD \u2013 DPM results.",

A 30-run full factorial design including three critical process parameters (liquid to solid ratio, barrel temperature and throughput) was conducted to evaluate the performance of each analytical tool. Eyecon\u2122 successfully captured the granule size and shape variation from different experimental conditions and demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to the fluctuation of size parameter D10 in the presence of process perturbations. The partial least square regression (PLSR) models developed using NIRS showed small relative standard error of prediction values (less than 5%) for most granule physical properties. In contrast, the RS-based PLSR models revealed higher prediction errors towards granule drug concentration, potentially due to the inhomogeneous premixing of raw materials during calibration model development.",

     "abstract": "Zeolites are well known for their ordered microporous networks, good hydrothermal stability, large surface area, high acidity and selectivity. These excellent properties make zeolites extremely useful for petrochemical processes and refining. However, the presence of only microporous channels also restricts the diffusion of reactants and products into and out of the microporous networks, especially limiting zeolite applications involving bulky molecules. The importance of developing hierarchical zeolites has attracted great attention in recent years due to the prospect of increased accessibility for bulky molecules. Introducing additional mesoporosity, and even macroporosity, into conventional zeolites produces a combination of three different size scales of porosity. It expands the original zeolite hierarchical structure and greatly enhances the mass transport of molecules while maintaining the intrinsic size, shape and transition state selectivity of zeolite. The promising applications of this new zeolite architecture have prompted a multitude of efforts to develop a variety of different synthesis strategies. In this review, we summarized and evaluated the modern synthesis strategies (bottom-up and top-down) for introducing additional meso/macroporosity into microporous zeolites. The advantages and limitations of these different strategies were discussed in detail.",

However, there are few articles available in this issue. In this paper, three representative pulverizing systems with diverse grinding patterns and gathering methods are selected to prepare superfine powder using the same raw coal. Afterwards, element analysis, approximate analysis, maceral determinations, surface area measurement and XPS tests are performed successively. The segregation tendencies and its influences on the coal powder are compared and discussed among three groups. Data of similar sizes in three groups receive special attentions. Based on the experiments, it is found that at the same conditions, vitrinite is easier to gain thorough crushing compared with inertinite. Due to the smaller sizes, vitrinite and ashes are prone to escape from the cyclone separator. Due to the high density, inertinite and ashes are apt to accumulate in the lower part of the coal pile. The maceral segregation imposes greater influences on the C-containing functional groups on the surfaces than the mechanochemical effects. The significances of this paper lie in figuring out the influences of grinding methods on properties and segregation patterns of superfine pulverized coal, which provide valuable references for industrial applications of this technology.",

The effects of nZVI dosage, pH, initial Pb (II) concentration and reaction time on the removal efficacy of Pb (II) were investigated. The results show that undried nZVI has more active sites due to its weaker oxidation, and thus the removal efficiency of Pb(II) by undried nZVI was higher than that by dried nZVI. As a result, the same removal efficiency could be achieved with the use of less undried nZVI for the identical concentration of Pb(II). Furthermore, the experimental procedure could be apparently simplified, which eliminates the steps of washing, separation and dehydration compared with the traditional preparation method.

The synthesized composites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, surface area analyzer (BET), and Fourier transform- infrared spectroscopy. The adsorption capacity and efficiency of the synthesised composites were examined towards removal of Rhodamine B (RhB) and Nickel ion (Ni2+). The results were compared with that of GO and commercial MMt clay. The kinetic sorption models were evaluated, and it was observed that sorption follows the pseudo-second-order kinetics. Adsorption isotherm was best fit into the Langmuir model (R2\u202f=\u202f0.996 for RhB & 0.957 for Ni2+). Among all the synthesized composites, MrGO-2, a composite of GO and montmorillonite with (1:10) ratio, showed maximum activity towards the adsorption of Rhodamine B and Ni2+ calculated to be 625\u202fmg/g and 178\u202fmg/g respectively at neutral pH condition. From the calculated \u0394G0 (\u22123.99 & \u22120.71\u202fkJ\u202fmol\u22121), \u0394H (28.6 & 4.61\u202fkJ\u202fmol\u22121) and \u0394S (\u2212107.5 & \u221217.8\u202fJ\u202fmol\u22121 K) values for RhB & Ni2+ respectively, it can be unambiguously inferred that the adsorption process was feasible, endothermic and exhibiting least randomness, respectively. The prepared MrGO composites showed good adsorption capacity towards efficient removal of RhB and Ni2+ in single as well as binary system.",

The results showed that coal samples treated with [Bmim][Cl] ionic liquid had a significant change in the content of aliphatic groups. In the coal samples treated with 0% concentration [Bmim][Cl], the content of CH2 groups was 77.86%, CH3 groups was 14.07%.

Besides, the contact angle is the minimal of a 41.1\u00b0 at 4% ionic liquid concentration. The relationship between contact angles and contents of functional groups were analyzed. Results showed that the content of CH3 groups and CH2 groups had the greatest effect on the contact angle and 4% [Bmim][Cl] ionic liquid treatment can effectively reduce the contact angle and improve the coal wettability. It is of great significance to increase coal wettability and reduce dust generation by changing the contents of functional groups.",

The granular mixture used in this work is composed of micronized white pure virgin PolyVinyl Chloride particles (WPVC) and gray PolyVinyl Chloride particles that contain a small percentage of carbon (GPVC) of average size 100\u202f\u03bcm. Moreover, a homemade method was developed to estimate the purity of the separated products. It was deduced that the separation outcome, in terms of recovery and purity, is efficient and depends on several factors: the high-voltage level, the rotating speed of the disks, the fluidization rate, the total mass of the fluidized bed and the composition ratio of the granular mixture.",

Forces acting on particles includes drag, lift, buoyancy and gravity. Four particle sizes are considered with the diameters of 5\u202f\u03bcm, 50\u202f\u03bcm, 100\u202f\u03bcm and 500\u202f\u03bcm. Results obtained for the fluid phase are in good agreement with the available experimental and numerical data. Predictions for particles show that particle size, flow Reynolds number and the duct (celling, floor and vertical) walls play important roles in near-wall particle deposition and resuspension. For the smallest particle (5\u202f\u03bcm), the particle deposition rates in duct ceiling, floor and vertical walls are found to be similar with each other and all increase with the flow Reynolds number, while the particle resuspension tends to occur in the middle wall regions and corners of the duct with less influenced by the flow Reynolds number. The ceiling deposition rate gradually decreases with particle size while the floor and vertical wall deposition rates both increase with particle size. The ceiling particle deposition rate increases with Reynolds number while the floor deposition rate decreases with it. The vertical deposition rate for the small particles (5\u201350\u202f\u03bcm) increases with the flow Reynolds number obviously, while for the large particles (100\u2013500\u202f\u03bcm) that becomes insensitive. In addition, the flow Reynolds number is found to have an obvious effect on particle resuspension while the effect of particle size on particle resuspension decreases with Reynolds number.

The heat produced in windings is removed by an appropriate heat transfer fluid such as liquid dielectrics. The cooling and insulating of a liquid dielectric depend on the properties of the oil filling the transformer. One of the approaches to enhance the thermal and dielectric properties of transformer oil is employing an appropriate nanoparticle in a transformer.In this paper, a three-phase distribution transformer is simulated three-dimensionally in order to study the heat transfer efficiency for pure oil (single phase) and nanofluid (TiO2 nanoparticles- transformer oil). For both models, the electromagnetic field in solid sections and heat transfer in fluid and solid sections of the transformer are simultaneously investigated. The simulation results show that the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles in the transformer oil increases the heat transfer coefficient, i.e. adding 1% (vol/vol) of TiO2 nanoparticles to the transformer oil increases the Nusselt number from 2.17 to 2.49, while the maximum temperature of transformer components decreases from 47.20\u202f\u00b0C to 43.05\u202f\u00b0C.",

The effects of inlet angle and particle size on separation efficiency are quantified.

By modifying the inlet pressure and material feed rate, data that predicts the performance of the conveying system have been obtained within the present study. Transient simulations have also been conducted and the results reveal intricate details of the cement flows along the pneumatic pipes and pipe bends. In particular, particle roping behaviour is observed to follow the sides of the wall before, during and after the pipe bends. A sloshing-like cement flow motion is also observed after the cement exits the bend. The concentration distribution of the cement particles is found not only to be partly due to gravitational effects but also the pneumatic pipe configuration. Lastly, close inspection of the secondary flows within the pneumatic pipe shows that their directional changes lead to a corresponding change in the particle roping direction, indicating that particle roping is closely associated with the secondary flow structures induced by the exact pipe configuration.",

The photocatalytic activity to degrade RhB molecules over Cs3PW12O40/WO3 composite was evaluated under xenon light irradiation. The results indicated the complete degradation of RhB molecules over Cs3PW12O40/WO3 composite after 30\u202fmin irradiation.

     "abstract": "Understanding thermodynamic stability relationship among polymorphs of any active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is a necessary step for drug formulation development. Knowledge of such relationship enables identification of a stable polymorphic form at the prevalent conditions. Curcumin, a pharmaceutically active ingredient found in herbal spice turmeric, exists in three polymorphic forms; a monoclinic form (Form 1) and two orthorhombic forms (Form 2 and Form 3). However, thermodynamic stability relationships among curcumin polymorphs have not been ascertained yet. This work therefore, was focused on understanding thermodynamic stability relationships among curcumin polymorphs. During purification of curcumin, the pressure applied for vacuum evaporation of organic solvent was found to significantly affect the polymorphic outcome. Form 1 was obtained at pressures ranging from 300 to 400\u202fmbar whereas Form 2 was obtained at pressures ranging from 100 to 200\u202fmbar. Form 3 was obtained by liquid antisolvent precipitation using ultrasound and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as an additive. The obtained polymorphs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) techniques. Relative stability of polymorphs was established by conducting solvent mediated transformation studies, thermal analysis through DSC and variable temperature X-ray diffraction studies (VT-XRD). It was observed that Form 2 and Form 3 irreversibly convert to Form 1 upon heating. Further, Form 2 and Form 3 convert to Form 1 in aqueous organic solutions at temperatures ranging from 0\u202f\u00b0C to 50\u202f\u00b0C. Thus, the curcumin polymorphs were found to be monotropically related to each other with the monoclinic form (Form 1) being the most stable form.",

A detailed description of the model equations used in this work has been presented. Predicted results were compared with the experimental data obtained by other group members. A good agreement between the numerical simulations and experimental results has been achieved. The inverse flow characteristics of particles were studied using a single type of particles and multiple types of particles with different densities under different liquid velocities and solids flow rates. The results indicated that for the particles with different densities, 950\u202fkg/m3, 850\u202fkg/m3 and 640\u202fkg/m3, the cross-sectional average solids holdup along the axis was uniform and the radial flow structures at different bed heights were identical. Particles moved from the walls to the center at the top region of the bed. Such tendency diminished as the particles move downwards. The axial velocities of solid particles were higher in the center and lower near the walls. For the particles with a density of 28\u202fkg/m3, due to the randomly generated vortexes of particles, the solids holdup radial distributions and the velocities of particles were more irregular.

The properties of synthesized compounds and individual MOF and MOR zeolite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption measurement and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The XRD results indicated diffraction peaks for each two compounds (MOR and MIL-101) in synthesized samples. The SEM and TEM images showed mixture of MOF and mordenite zeolite via refluxing and solvothermal method. In hydrothermal method, a new composite were fabricated by diffuse of MIL-101 particles with octahedral and spherical morphology in plate shaped MOR zeolite. The nitrogen sorption isotherms characterized microporous cages in MOR/MIL-101 samples and individual samples. The BET results showed the surface areas of all synthesized compounds were smaller than individual MOF and MOR zeolite. Based on TGA plots, synthesized MOR/MOF compounds were more thermally stable compared to the isolated MIL-101(Cr). All prepared compounds were tested as bi-functional adsorbent in removal of acidic/anionic methyl orange (MO) and cationic methylene blue (MB) dyes simultaneously. The acidity from framework Al-O(H)-Si sites in MOR and basicity from amine groups in MIL-101 obtained by post-synthetic modification. Among the synthesized compounds, MOR/MIL-101 composite by solvothermal method were selected as the best bi-functional adsorbent.",

To unravel any changes in the characteristics of the particles, the XRD and FESEM techniques, in addition to photoluminescence (PL), Raman and UV\u2013Vis\u2013NIR spectroscopies, were applied. According to the analyses, 15\u202fmin sonication using 200\u202fW power can provide the highest quality of the Ag2S crystals. Moreover, it was found out that Zn doping shifts the XRD peaks of Ag2S to higher angles and declines crystallinity of the samples while it does not change the spherical shape of the Ag2S particles. The other impact of Zn presence in the crystal lattice of Ag2S was declared to be increasing the size of the Ag2S nanostructures. Importantly, based on the PL results, the un- and Zn-doped Ag2S particles present several emission bands lying in the visible spectrum of light due to their specific optical near band emission (NBE) and crystal defects. As the Tauc plots spectra demonstrated, increasing the Zn concentration decreases the optical band gap energy of the Ag2S nanostructures. Also, the Raman results unraveled the impact of synthesis conditions on the optical and crystalline properties of the grown structures.",

     "abstract": "In the present study the Euler/Lagrange approach in combination with a proper turbulence model and full two-way coupling is applied for erosion estimation due to particle conveying along a horizontal to vertical pipe bend. Particle tracking considers both particle translational and rotational motion and all relevant forces such as drag, gravity/buoyancy and transverse lift due to shear and particle rotation were accounted for La\u00edn and Sommerfeld (2012). Moreover, models for turbulent transport of the particles, collisions with rough walls and inter-particle collisions using a stochastic approach are considered Sommerfeld and La\u00edn (2009). In this work, the different transport effects on spherical solid particle erosion in a pipe bend of a pneumatic conveying system are analysed. For describing the combined effect of cutting and deformation erosion the model of Oka et al. (2005) is used. Erosion depth was calculated for two- and four-way coupling and for mono-sized spherical glass beads as well as a size distribution of particles with the same number mean diameter (i.e. 40\u202f\u03bcm). Additionally, particle mass loading was varied in the range from 0.3 to 1.0. The erosion model was validated on the basis of experiments by Mazumder et al. (2008) for a narrow vertical to horizontal pipe system with high conveying velocity. Then a 150\u202fmm pipe system with 5\u202fm horizontal pipe, pipe bend and 5\u202fm vertical pipe with a bulk velocity of 27\u202fm/s was considered for further analysis. As a result inter-particle collisions reduce erosion although the wall collision frequency is enhanced Sommerfeld and La\u00edn (2015); additionally, considering a particle size distribution with the same number mean diameter as mono-sized particles yields much higher erosion depth. Finally, when particle mass loading is increased, bend erosion is reduced due to modifications of particle impact velocity and angle, although wall collision frequency grows.",

The synergy between Sm and N dopants, as well as diatomite and TiO2 were studied. The photoactivity of SN-TDHP was investigated via the degradation towards an antibiotic tetracycline (TC) solution under visible light, and then the optimal co-doping amount and pellet dosage were determined. The optimal pellet catalyst presented its removal rate of TC as 87.2% within 150\u202fmin of reaction time.

These samples are adequately chosen to study the sintering behaviour on the addition of boron and iron on the Ti-rich corner. The rate of sintering of Ti-B-Fe alloys was found to increase with an increase in iron content. The sintering enhancement can be attributed to the high diffusivity of iron in \u03b1-Ti and \u03b2-Ti phases and due to the formation of the intermetallic phase which results in greater overall shrinkage. The shrinkage was found to decrease with increase in boron content due to a greater amount of TiB2 which doesn\u2019t participate in sintering in the observed range.",

The particle-fluid interaction is two-way coupled, while inter-particle and particles-walls interactions are calculated based on the soft-sphere model. The Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) is used to represent the roughness of planar walls, and its effect on particle transport is quantitatively studied. When particles transport between two parallel smooth plates, the planar walls exert extra hydrodynamic retardation, which causes particle transport velocity to decrease with the decrease in the aperture between two plates. In contrast, when particles transport between two parallel rough plates, due to frequent interaction between particles, the mechanical interaction-induced retardation starts to work and further decreases particle transport velocity. Particle longitudinal migration is frequent because of inter-particle interaction, which hinders its transverse transport and even causes particle agglomeration in a duct during horizontal transport. In addition, the mechanical retardation is significantly dependent of particle transport regimes, and its effect gradually increases and changes to be dominant at high particle Reynold number regime.",

The current work explores improving the beneficiation of nickel from limonitic laterite ore through interaction of silica and calcium sulfate in a selective reduction-wet magnetic separation process.

The results demonstrated that, under spray pressure of 6\u202fMPa, the Sauter mean droplet size, negative pressure suction flow rate and effective spray distance of the novel dedust device with a throat-to-nozzle distance and throat diameter of 20\u202fmm and 65\u202fmm were 47.37\u202f\u00b5m, 11.21\u202fm3/min and 5.4\u202fm respectively. Moreover, the novel dedust device produced droplets to a smaller scale than a single-nozzle. Additionally, the negative pressure and airflow velocity in the negative pressure suction inlet of novel dedust device were within the range from \u22120.97\u202fPa to \u2212541.04\u202fPa and from 2.96\u202fm/s to 27.29\u202fm/s respectively. Finally, compared with the original dust suppression measures, the local spray closure technique can enhance the removal ratio of respiratory dust by an average of 44.3%.",

     "abstract": "The effect of a linearly heated left sidewall on natural convection flows in a cavity filled with nanofluid-superposed porous layers is investigated numerically using the Galerkin finite element method. Two cases, which use the vertical and horizontal directions for the porous\u2013nanofluid layers, are considered to investigate the natural convection in the flow inside a square enclosure. In both cases, the left wall is linearly heated, whereas the right wall is isothermally cooled. The horizontal walls are assumed to be thermally insulated. The Darcy\u2013Brinkmann model is used to solve the governing equations in the porous layer. The results show that the nanofluid produces more enhancement of heat transfer compared to the base fluid. Increasing the Rayleigh number ( R a ) values caused the intensity of the streamlines in case 2 to be stronger than that in case 1. Lower values of the thermal conductivity ratio ( K r ) imply greater heat transfer enhancement than for the high thermal conductivity ratios. At the low values of the thermal conductivity ratio ( K r < 1 ) and Darcy number values ( D a < 10 - 3 ) , the heat transfer is more enhanced for case 2 compared to case 1 while higher Darcy number produced case 1 overcome case 2.",

The addition of fine material, such as concentrate or concentrate agglomerated into micropellets, to the sinter mixture affects the pressure drop. This study numerically predicts the pressure drop over several granulated mixtures in order to reduce the number of experimental measurements. The pressure drop was studied both experimentally using a pot grate and by coupled DEM (Discrete Element Method) \u2013 CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations. The validation of the model was performed by comparing the measured and numerical values of the pressure drop across glass beads 3 and 6\u202fmm in diameter respectively.

Batch adsorption experiments were performed for optimizing various conditions such as solution pH, contact time, temperature and adsorbent dose for maximizing the nitrite adsorption onto SCIAC. Considerably, a very high nitrite adsorption percentage of 83.8 was obtained for an initial nitrite concentration of 5.0\u202fmg/L at pH 3.0. Among the various equilibrium and kinetic models, Freundlich and pseudo-second-order expressions, respectively, were well enough to explain the adsorption processes. In general, it may conclude that the change in surface characteristics of the adsorbent material after the pyrolysis process is highly favorable for effective removal of nitrite ions from aqueous systems.

We herein first develop a facile and scale up approach to synthesize porous polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with lamellar structure through thermal polycondensation of supramolecular aggregates. The feature of this approach lies in the directed in-situ self-assembly of cyanuric acid molecules, converted from the hydrolysis of melamine in NaOH solution, with the residual melamine molecules to form supramolecular aggregates, which lead to the formation of porous g-C3N4 with lamellar structure. The synthesized lamellar g-C3N4 exhibit superior photocatalytic activity as demonstrated by the complete degradation of methylene blue (MB) under one hour\u2019s visible light irradiation, as well as excellent stability with high activity retained after four runs of MB degradation testing. The enhancement in photocatalytic performance can be attributed to its unique lamellar structure with high surface area, narrow bandgap, and efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. This work shows that the alkaline solutions can be used as the molecular self-assembly medium and opens a new avenue towards designing highly active g-C3N4-based photocatalyts for energy and environmental applications.",

The photoactivity of FN-TDHG was investigated via the degradation towards tetracycline (TC) solution under visible light irradiation, and then the optimal co-doping amount and granule dosage were determined. The optimal granule catalyst presented its removal rate of TC as 96.5% within 150\u202fmin.

To validate the simulation results, the numerical predictions for the expansion ratio and the pressure drop of a tapered fluidized bed were compared with experimental data and good agreement was observed. The obtained simulation results clearly indicate that an apt apex angle exists in tapered-in reactors in which the fractional conversion reaches a maximum value; while the variations of the apex angle slightly affect the fractional conversion in tapered-out fluidized beds. Increasing the residence time of the gas phase in the upper section of tapered-in beds has positive influences on the fractional conversion, while a further decrease in the gas phase velocity in the tapered-in reactors has a negative effect on the fractional conversion.

In this work, we measured the triboelectric charging of PE powders using both sliding and shaking apparatuses in dependence on humidity, impact velocity of colliding particles and temperature of the colliding particles or of the wall. As expected, saturation charge of PE particles is reduced with increasing air humidity. However, in a more detailed study we observed that whenever we change the humidity, the saturation charge rapidly reaches the equilibrium value and no hysteresis in charging that might be caused, for example, by adsorption/desorption thermodynamics is observed. Saturation charge is believed to be independent of impact velocity; however, we show that the saturation charge is proportional to impact velocity in the system of PE particles of non-spherical shape. The charging is more pronounced as the temperature of PE particles increases, however, it is unchanged if only the metal wall in contact with the particles is heated. That is a different trend than observed for spherical metal particles (Greason, 2000).",

As the results, the CA sheet materials prepared using NIPS process and after removing 60\u202fvol% CaCO3 have an enlargement of pores with a size lower than the mean free path of air.

The NIR chemical imaging, corroborated by SEM imaging and drug content relative standard deviation (RSD) indicates that the drug is uniformly distributed without any observable large agglomerates. The films with SA showed lower mechanical strength as compared to HPMC due to SA\u2019s low molecular weight. All films exhibited immediate drug release as has been the case using FNB nano particles in previous papers. Interestingly, although addition of plasticizer improved film dissolution, HPMC-based films had a faster dissolution compared to SA-based films in spite of higher mechanical strength of the former.",

One possibility for the preparation of submicron-sized particles is spray drying. However, the generation of small droplets at a high production rate and the precipitation of submicron particles are quite challenging. In order to produce a sufficient amount of fine and uniform droplets, a two-fluid nozzle with internal mixing was combined with a cyclone droplet separator. The precipitation of particles was realized with an electrostatic precipitator. Considering the difficulty of electrostatic precipitation concerning explosion risks and to make it capable using organic solvents, the spray dryer was integrated in a pressure resistant vessel. Based on previous experiments, the now presented design is compact and the electrostatic precipitator is shortened. In addition, enhanced drying conditions ensured a controlled and reproducible preparation of submicron-sized particles. Thus, high separation efficiencies were shown. Spray-drying experiments were conducted with the model substance mannitol. With the cyclone droplet separator, a fine and uniform spray with a droplet size smaller 2\u202f\u03bcm was produced. This robust atomizing technique is capable for high concentrations. For a 10\u202fwt% mannitol solution, particles in the submicron range d50,3\u202f=\u202f0.7\u202f\u03bcm were produced.",

While the morphological changes due to plasma exposure are captured by SEM, the AFM measurement shows the variations in surface roughness for both corn starch and ibuprofen powders. The XPS and surface energy results confirm that the surface groups change is dominating under initial exposure, but longer exposure creates more damaging effect than building the new active sites at the surface. The contact angle (CA) measurement shows that with increase in treatment time, the CA decrease from 48\u00b0 to 33\u00b0 for corn starch and 69\u00b0 to 51\u00b0 for ibuprofen. A comparison of experimentally obtained CA and that of theoretically calculated CA shows that there exists some difference. This may be attributed to the absence of surface group contribution in the Wenzel model.

     "abstract": "Dispersion of ultrafine powders is difficult due to their high cohesion and consequent agglomeration. Dry coating with additives such as nano-silica, magnesium stearate (MgSt), or Leucine (Leu), an amino acid, may help mitigate this problem. Unfortunately, when the powders to be coated are very fine, the additives such as MgSt or Leu need to be of even finer size, requiring a separate milling process. Here, a two-step co-milling process is investigated to produce well dispersible inhalable size range (<5 \u00b5m) particles. The main advantage is that the powder to be coated and additives have starting size of several hundred microns and do not require separate pre-milling. In the first step, Potassium Chloride (KCl), used as a surrogate API, and Leu are pre-milled in a ball mill to achieve KCl coated with Leu of \u223c10\u202f\u00b5m. In the second step, simultaneous co-milling via jet-milling of pre-coated KCl down to inhalable size KCl, coated with Leu is done. The dispersibility of coated KCl was assessed through laser diffraction of dry powder at low dispersion pressure (Sympatec Rodos-Helos), corroborated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and FT4 powder tester measuring flow function coefficient (FFC), conditioned bulk density, and aerated energy. This assessment revealed that about 2\u202fwt% Leu was adequate to provide best overall dispersibility. The dispersibility of milled KCl after coating with Leu was found to be better compared with uncoated and MgSt or nano-silica coated KCl. Overall, this two-step co-milling of KCl with 2\u202fwt% Leu yielded well-dispersible, <5\u202f\u00b5m particles from starting particles of two orders of magnitude larger sizes.",

With the big data captured in the pharmaceutical industry, computational intelligence (CI) models could potentially be used to identify critical quality attributes (CQA), CMA and critical process parameters (CPP). The objective of this study was to develop computational intelligence models for pharmaceutical tabletting processes, for which bio-inspired feature selection algorithms were developed and implemented for optimisation while artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to predict the tablet characteristics such as porosity and tensile strength. Various pharmaceutical excipients (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, MCC DG, Mannitol Pearlitol 200SD, Lactose, and binary mixtures) were considered. Granules were also produced with dry granulation using roll compaction. The feed powders and granules were then compressed at various compression pressures to produce tablets with different porosities, and the corresponding tensile strengths were measured. For the CI modelling, the efficiency of seven bio-inspired optimization algorithms were explored: grey wolf optimization (GWO), bat optimization (BAT), cuckoo search (CS), flower pollination algorithm (FPA), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and social spider optimization (SSO). Two-thirds of the experimental dataset was randomly chosen as the training set, and the remaining was used to validate the model prediction. The model efficiency was evaluated in terms of the average reduction (representing the fraction of selected input variables) and the mean square error (MSE). It was found that the CI models can well predict the tablet characteristics (i.e. porosity and tensile strength). It was also shown that the GWO algorithm was the most accurate in predicting porosity. While the most accurate prediction for the tensile strength was achieved using the SSO algorithm. In terms of the average reduction, the GA algorithm resulted in the highest reduction of inputs (i.e. 60%) for predicting both the porosity and the tensile strength.",

We found that the compaction profile is not reproducible when particles larger than 1/6 of the die diameter are present in the powder sample. The presence of these large particles generate a highly heterogeneous inter-particle contact and bonding forces. The discrete particle simulations showed that for these heterogeneous compacts the tensile strength exhibits high variability, even for one compact if the diametrical compression force is applied along different axes. Based on these results, it is recommend that the largest particle in a powder compact should not exceed one sixth of the die diameter, which is the same as the recommendation of ASTM International D4767 - 11 for compression test of cohesive soils.",

We report herein a study aimed at empirical understanding of the influence of electrospray process parameters on the size distribution of microdroplets of chitosan solutions with different molecular weights and concentrations. How the nature of interchain interactions in the solution affects the electrospray mode, was studied for different applied voltages, V , over a wide range of solution flow rates, Q . Stable cone-jets were observed only for solutions in the unentangled regime. Unlike solutions of non-polymeric electrolytes of comparable viscosities, the chitosan droplet size distribution generally showed a strong dependence not only on Q but also on V and the solution viscosity.

The PBM, which models size reduction as a series of breakage events, was formulated so that the model parameters separate the effect of material properties and milling process conditions. Because of this novel aspect, the PBM should have excellent predictive capability with specific applications in technology transfer and scale-up. To investigate this application, copovidone extrudate produced by the hot-melt extrusion process was milled using a lab-scale continuous impact mill (Fitz Mill). The effect of impeller speed and classification screen size on PSD of the extrudate was investigated. The PBM with parameters obtained by fitting lab-scale PSD data was then applied to model the PSD of the extrudate following milling by a pilot-scale continuous impact mill (Hosokawa mill). The study found that the parameters determined at the lab-scale can be used to model PSDs at the pilot-scale and may be generally applied to similar classification-type impact mills. Since technology transfer and scale-up can be material and time consuming, this approach may offer significant benefits to the pharmaceutical industry for the development of milling processes.",

The effects of the exposure time on each mineral\u2019s recovery at different concentrations, pH and particle sizes were studied through microflotation, and the adsorption of the collectors was analyzed by electrophoretic zeta potential measurements.

The flotation of the microwave-treated minerals required greater sodium oleate concentration. The treated and non-treated pentlandite and pyrrhotite samples did not float at pH 10. Although the treated chalcopyrite and pentlandite displayed low recoveries at all pH values, the treated pyrrhotite displayed high floatability at acidic and neutral pH. The recovery of the microwave-treated sulphide minerals was more affected by the particle size in the tests with potassium amyl xanthate than with sodium oleate.

If the affinity between the particles and polymer is sufficient enough, the particles are entrapped in the polymer network and particle network can be achieved. To expand this technique to particles with various physical properties, the surface of the particles was identified using the Hansen dispersibility parameter (HDP).

Using dynamic light scattering (DLS) the particle size, size distribution and the zeta potential of nanoparticles were measured. The morphological characteristics were studied using SEM. The fine particle fractions (FPFs) of nanoparticles were determined by a twin stage impinger (TSI) using a Rotahaler at 60\u202fL/min flow rate.

In this research, a micromechanical model for unsaturated assemblies composed of elliptical particles is presented so that the effect of capillary force, confining stress, and particle shape on unsaturated granular media behavior is analyzed in the pendular regime. As one of the early attempts, the toroidal liquid bridge for elliptical particles is studied in granular assemblies using modified ELLIPSE program, Discrete Element Method based program. The results show that although the strength of spherical particles grows when the saturated degree increases, the strength of elliptical particles rises and then decreases; however, the friction angle remains almost constant. Furthermore, the highest percentage of apparent-cohesion rise takes place at saturation degree of 10% at the highest eccentricity. As long as the eccentricity increases, the effect of capillary force on shear strength grows continuously. Not only do unsaturated assemblies contract more at low strains, but also they expand more after the phase transfer point at high stains. The assembly composed of particles with eccentricity of 0.15 has the highest coordination number. The coordination number constantly increases with the saturation degree for circular particles. In contrast, for elliptical particles assemblies, when degree of saturation increases, the coordination number increases at the beginning then drops.",

This extensive experimental investigation allowed the evaluation of the accuracy of PIVlab in granular flow applications and also helped to assess the reliability of measurements of second-order statistics, such as the granular temperature. Finally, a guideline for setting a reliable PIV arrangement is suggested.",

The effect of Ho3+ doping on the structure, dielectric, piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of PMN-PT ceramics was studied. Perovskite phase of pure and Ho-doped 0.64Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.36PbTiO3 ceramics were synthesized using solid state reaction method. Powder XRD confirmed the incorporation of Ho3+ ions in PMN-PT lattice. EDX spectra confirmed the existence of Ho and its homogeneity in doped-sample. The average grain size, transition temperature and dielectric loss factor (tan \u03b4) decreased while the density and the dielectric constant of the PMN-PT ceramic increased by Ho doping. Furthermore, an increase in the ferroelectric properties and the piezoelectric coefficient (d33\u2217, from 547 to 610\u202fpm/V) were observed for doped sample. The \u2018Remanent Hysteresis Task\u2019 revealed that a major portion (80.42%) of the remanent polarization (Pr) is switchable in the sample which makes Ho-doped PMN-PT a potential material for memory switching devices. Time-dependent compensated (TDC) hysteresis task and fatigue test were carried out which revealed resistive leakage and fatigue free nature of Ho-doped PMN-PT ceramic. These results demonstrate that Ho-doped PMN-PT ceramic possesses excellent properties to achieve a variety of applications.",

The scale-up approach is the parallelization of multiple transferred arcs in one reactor, which were previously individually optimized. Furthermore, a novel filtration and bagging system is introduced, which is designed to handle pyrophoric metal nanoparticles. It is shown that the production rate of the process scales linearly with the number of transferred arcs, while the particle size stays on the nanoscale.",

Pressure fluctuations were measured and analyzed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Recurrence Plot (RP) and Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA). Results of FFT showed that the wall vibration creates a periodic signal at 100\u202fHz which is not originated from the bed hydrodynamics. RP of pressure fluctuations before and after applying the assisting forces showed that the white areas in the plot decrease in size, which indicates an increase in the contribution of meso-structures such as agglomerates and small bubbles. The transition in the equilibrium bed hydrodynamics, between the condition in which assisting forces are not applied and condition in which they are applied, was tracked. It was shown by the determinism of pressure fluctuations that when the iron oxide nanoparticles exist alongside with alumina nanoparticles, this transition to the new equilibrium condition was reached in a shorter time. Determinism of pressure fluctuation of beds containing iron oxide decreased after applying the assisting forces. This trend confirms that large bubbles start to disappear and become substituted by smaller structures when magnetic field is applied to the bed. Under this condition, the interphase contact efficiency increases and the bed becomes closer to the Agglomerate Particle Fluidization (APF) regime.",

The most important organic pyrite depressants are starch, dextrin, guargum, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA), Diethylenetriamine (DETA). In this paper, flotation experiments were carried out by modified Halimond tube. At first, flotation experiments were performed to obtain optimal pyrite flotation condition (suitable collector and frother for maximum recovery). In optimal condition (collector: KAX\u202f+\u202fKIPX , 16\u202fppm; collector condition time: 4\u202fmin; frother: Poly Propylene Glycol (A65), 20\u202fppm; frother condition time: 30\u202fs), pyrite recovery increased to 95.63%. Flotation kinetics experiments were performed and various kinetic models were evaluated on pyrite flotation. The results showed that flotation kinetics of pyrite is second-order. After obtaining optimal condition for flotation and kinetic studies, the effects of type and dosage of different organic depressants including starch, dextrin, guargum, carboxymethyl cellulose, EDTA and DETA at three concentrations (50, 100, 150\u202fppm) at neutral pH were comprehensively investigated.

Preliminary mineralogical characterisation identified bastn\u00e4site, monazite, stetindite, brannerite, florencite, and stillwellite as the REE minerals, with hematite and quartz being the major gangue minerals in the tailings material. The flotation response of the rare earth oxides (REO) and major gangue phases was investigated using sodium oleate and hydroxamic acid as collectors; and sodium silicate and starch as depressants. Generally, sodium oleate displayed relatively better selectivity for REO than hydroxamic acid in the presence of the depressants. The rougher-scavenger-cleaner flotation configuration using sodium oleate and the depressants produced a final concentrate recovering 63% REO at a grade of 2.25%. This investigation shows that both collectors may be used for REO recovery but the use of depressants is key, in tandem with cleaning of the rougher and scavenger concentrates. The pulp pH also had a strong impact on the flotation recovery of REO, with the selectivity deteriorating with increasing collector dosage. Furthermore, the high proportion of gangue minerals reporting to the concentrates, even with the use of depressants, affected the quality of concentrates grade. This study has shown that particle size distribution and mineralogical characteristics of feed significantly affect the upgrade and recovery of REO.",

It was found that Y2O3 and MgO NPs modified with polyethyleneimine-oleic acid complex (PEI-OA) could be effectively attached to Si particles by simple mixing in dense toluene slurry. Field emission scanning electron microscopy observations confirmed the attachment of PEI-OA-modified sintering aids to Si particles without forming large NP agglomerates. The adsorption of the PEI-OA-modified sintering aids and PEI-OA on the surface of Si particles drastically improved the stability of the Si-based toluene slurry, which was subsequently molded through wet vacuum casting and dewaxed to fabricate a Si-based green body. The obtained green body was nitrided at 1375\u202f\u00b0C for 4\u202fh at a N2 pressure of 0.15\u202fMPa and further sintered at 1850\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh at a N2 pressure of 0.9\u202fMPa. The adsorption of sintering aid particles on the Si surface reduced the number of contact points between Si particles in the green body, which effectively suppressed the Si melting process during nitriding and improved the characteristics of the produced nitride body such as the degree of nitriding and \u03b1/(\u03b1+\u03b2) ratio of Si3N4, leading to the successful fabrication of high-density Si3N4 ceramics during the subsequent densification step.",

Different-sized tablets of porous materials were prepared and evaluated by this method using various solvents to estimate liquid absorption into the intra-particle pores and interstices of the particles. The amount of liquid trapped in the interstices of the particles decreased with decreasing tablet volume, after which the amount of liquid in the intra-particle pores could be estimated. Finally, API-loaded particles were prepared by absorbing the API solution into porous carriers based on the intra-capacity revealed above. No free API was found on the surface of the prepared particles, as it was well absorbed into the intra-particle pores. Collectively, this tensiometer method using different-sized tablets of porous materials appears to be a promising technique for evaluating the liquid absorption characteristics of porous pharmaceutical materials.",

The approach presented here consists in co-locating the overlapping parts of the simulation domain of each software on the same MPI process, in order to reduce the cost of the data exchanges. It is shown how this strategy allows reducing memory consumption and inter-process communication between CFD and DEM to a minimum and therefore to overcome an important parallelization bottleneck identified in the literature.

The results showed that the shape of a soybean seed particle could be approximated to an ellipsoid and that the dispersity in size could be approximated by a normal distribution. Additionally, a certain functional relationship between the primary dimension and secondary dimensions was determined. On this basis, an approach for modelling soybean seed particles based on the multi-sphere (MS) method was proposed. The soybean seed particle was simplified to an ellipsoid with the averaged size of one hundred randomly selected soybean seeds. The model of a single soybean seed particle was built by filling spheres within the ellipsoid. For modelling soybean seed assembly, the primary dimension was generated according to the normal distribution, and the other secondary dimensions were calculated based on their relationships with the primary dimension. In this way, the model of soybean seed assembly with different sizes and distributions was built. In this paper, four varieties of soybean seed were used. By comparing the simulated results and experimental results both in piling tests and \u201cself-flow screening\u201d tests, when the number of filling spheres was five, the simulated results were close to those obtained experimentally.

     "abstract": "The stress in the quasi-static particle flow is often modeled through the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. In the extension to complex three-dimensional flows, a granular viscosity is introduced through a tensorial rheology and the deviatoric frictional stress tensor is assumed aligned with the strain rate tensor. This granular viscosity is singular as the shear rate approaches zero, regardless of the local rheology. We discuss the influence of regularizing such a frictional viscosity on the particle circulation rate and other measured characteristics in a laboratory scale draft tube spouted bed. The friction between particles is modeled either with a constant Coulomb rheology or using a local particle pressure and strain-rate based friction known as \u03bc I -rheology. The predictions appear very dependent on the regularization parameter introduced by the method. The mean properties of the flow (e.g. circulation and pressure drop) monotonically converge towards the measurements when the regularization parameter tends to zero. In other respects, the two regularization models regarded in this study induced similar hydrodynamics within the spouted bed of interest. But the analysis of the conditional averages of the inertial number and the fraction of the solids in the quasi-static regime shows that the extent and staticity of the quasi-static region is sensitive to changes to the regularization parameter or regularization function.",

The results indicated that the MIL-100(Fe)@Fe3O4/CA degrade TC up to 85%, which is much higher than MIL-100(Fe)@Fe3O4 (c.a. 42%), due to its high surface area 389\u202fm2\u202fg\u22121, smaller pore size and pore volume 2.4\u202fnm and 0.319\u202fm3\u202fg\u22121, high separation of electron and hole, and lower band gap of 1.76\u202feV. The coupling of CA with MIL-100(Fe)@Fe3O4 considerably accelerate the transfer of photo-generated charge carriers and enhanced 1.6 times the performance of MIL-100(Fe)@Fe3O4. Furthermore, the stability and recyclability were enhanced due to the addition of Fe3O4, facilitating the environmentally friendly water purification processes.",

In the present work, copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) were synthesized by a greener route using Cordia sebestena (C. sebestena) flower aqueous extract. The nanoparticles were evaluated for their catalytic efficiency. The green synthesized CuO NPs were characterized using various analytical studies. A UV\u2013Visible spectrum with peak at 267\u202fnm and the peaks in their FT-IR spectrum at 431 and 542\u202fcm\u22121 showed reduction by the plant metabolites. FESEM-EDX analysis of CuO NPs shows an agglomerated spherical shape with signatures of Cu and O and XRD reveals characteristic crystallinity. TEM and DLS analyses showed particle size between 20 and 35\u202fnm and TEM-SAED pattern ensured crystallinity. A Zeta potential of \u221226\u202fmV demonstrates moderate stability. The CuO NPs acted as a catalyst in the Biginelli reaction to produce 3,4-dihydropyrimidinones rapidly and at high yield. The NPs also degraded bromothymol blue (BTB) by photocatalysis with hydrogen peroxide. 100% dye removal efficiency was achieved by 3\u202fh exposure of BTB to natural sunlight inferring it as economy, ecofriendly and effective catalyst. This finding illustrates that the NPs could be used in photolysis to remove water pollutants. Moreover, the biological significance of green synthesized CuO NPs was assessed by antibacterial activity against selected pathogenic bacterial organisms.",

     "abstract": "In mineral processing, ground ore particles containing valuable minerals are commonly separated from the gangue by flotation. For efficient flotation, surface liberation, in which the particle surface is composed of one phase, is important. Surface liberation is commonly measured by two-dimensional (2D) measurement of particle sections of resin-mounted samples. Such 2D measurement is considered to result in a form of error called stereological bias; however, the stereological bias associated with surface liberation assessment has not been fully studied. A series of numerical simulations was here conducted, to investigate the influence of a particle\u2019s texture (the 3D internal particle structure) and shape on such stereological bias. First, a total of 110 patterns of texture (10 patterns of grain size times 11 levels of grain content) were modeled, to determine the general characteristics of the stereological bias. Then, the influence on the stereological bias, of particle shape as represented by the aspect ratio (an index of global shape) and corrected sphericity (an index of surface roughness), was investigated. The results revealed that texture had the largest, aspect ratio the second largest, and corrected sphericity the smallest influence on the stereological bias in surface liberation measurement. Based on the results, it is suggested that a rough estimate of the stereological bias in the measurement of irregularly shaped real ore particles can be made from much simpler numerical models of spherical particles.",

The potentiality of Bi2S3 hierarchical nanostructures for the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB), Methylene blue (MB) and the mixture of RhB-MB organic dyes have been demonstrated and compared with commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25) sample under visible light illumination. The degradation efficiency of Bi2S3 and Degussa P25 is found to be higher in the single as well as in the binary dye solution for MB degradation as compared to RhB degradation. Furthermore, the degradation rate of RhB and MB is enhanced by \u223c8 times and \u223c3 times in their binary solution as compared to that in single dye solution. Whereas, Bi2S3 has demonstrated \u223c14 times higher degradation rate of both RhB and MB in their binary solution than that of Degussa P25 for RhB and MB degradation in the binary solution under visible light exposure, respectively. Interestingly, Bi2S3 nanostructures has exhibited larger improvement in the degradation efficiency for RhB in its binary solution which is attributed to the faster separation of photogenerated charge carriers due to the proper alignments between the molecular orbits of dyes and band level positions of Bi2S3 in RhB-MB-Bi2S3 heterogenous system. The photocatalytic degradation study of colourless contaminants, p-chlorophenol (CP), p-nitrophenol (NP) and their mixture (CP-NP) is also investigated in the presence of Bi2S3 nanoflowers. Among the phenolic compounds, the degradation rate of NP is observed to be highest in the single solution. However, the degradation rate of both CP and NP is found to decrease in binary mixture solution in comparison to their individual solution. A possible mechanism for the enhanced photodegradation of RhB-MB dye mixture based on the active species trapping experiment has been proposed.",

The corresponding solid kinetic viscosities of the two particulate phases are determined by the previous granular bed surface fitting (BSF) method. The effects of the specularity coefficients used in the simulations on the segregation patterns in the rotating drums are systematically studied by using the specularity coefficient values ranging from 0.15 to 1.0. When using a smaller specularity coefficient value in the simulation, the momentum transferring from the drum wall to the particulate phase is poorer, lowering the kinetic energy of the particulate phase. The lower particulate phase kinetic energy causes slower particle motion in the bed and hence delays the segregation core/band formation. At the same simulation time, the concentration of the smaller particles in the segregation core increases with the increasing of the specularity coefficient value used in the simulation. When the specularity coefficient values larger than 0.4 are used in our simulations, the realistic three-dimensional segregation structures are well predicted. A proper specularity coefficient value should be adopted in Eulerian multiphase CFD simulations of granular flows.",

Meanwhile, the viscosity and its influencing factors were studied using a Brookfield viscometer. The study shows that smaller medium particles (0.074\u20130.15\u202fmm) can reduce the viscosity of fluidized beds, but they will aggravate the viscosity fluctuation at more than 5\u202fwt% addition, which is unfavorable to the stability of fluidized beds. In addition, in the actual separation process, the external factors (such as moisture and coal powder content) also affect the viscosity of the fluidized beds. Increasing the moisture increases the viscosity of the fluidized bed, whereas coal dust has the opposite effect. In order to ensure the stability of the fluidized bed, the bed moisture content should be controlled below 1\u202fwt%, while the content of coal powder should be limited below 5\u202fwt%.

Numerical pressure drop results were in close agreement with the experimental data.

A critical value of spiral guide vane turns appeared below or above which there was a marked increase in collection efficiency, pressure drop, and tangential velocity. Compared to a cyclone with zero spiral guide vane turn, the maximal decrease in collection efficiency in the cyclone with the critical spiral guide vane turns (one turn) was 2% approximately. The maximum-efficiency inlet velocity appeared to exist independent of spiral guide vane turns, as inlet velocity affected the radial distance traveled by the rebounded particles from the inner wall. The analysis of flow field in cyclones indicated that the flow field was improved with the spiral guide vanes employed to some extent. The results presented here may provide a workable reference for the effects of spiral guide vanes on the flow field and corresponding performance in cyclone separators.",

The XRD, FESEM coupled with EDX elemental mapping, TEM, FTIR, Raman and XPS results reveal that the SnO2 nanoparticles have been successfully incorporated onto the RGO sheets. The reduction in the energy gap of the composite sample as compared to SnO2 measured from the Tauc\u2019s relation can be attributed to strong coupling between RGO and SnO2 NPs. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows improved thermal stability of the SnO2/RGO-Nc. From the dielectric measurements, it is observed that the dielectric constant and dielectric loss decreases as frequency of applied field increases. AC conductivity of all samples increases as applied frequency increases which follows Jonscher\u2019s power law. All composite samples show better conductivity as compared to SnO2. This is due to the formation of continuous conductive pathway between SnO2 and RGO sheets. Further high dielectric constant, low loss and high ac conductivity have been observed at optimum loading of RGO in SnO2/RGO2-Nc as compared to other composite samples which is due the percolation effects. The impedance analysis exhibits only one semicircle for SnO2 and SnO2/RGO composite which suggests that the involvement of grain boundaries dominated over the grain contribution.",

While the fragmentation of openly structured (fractal dimension Df\u202f<\u202f2) agglomerates during perpendicular impaction was the subject of several investigations, the fragmentation during oblique impaction is not experimentally investigated so far. During oblique impaction a tangential velocity component acts on the agglomerates leading to an increased fragmentation for the investigated agglomerate structures (with Df\u202f=\u202f1.6, 1.8, 2.3, 2.6 and 3.0). For the agglomerates with Df\u202f=\u202f1.6. 1.8, 2.3 and 2.6 the degree of fragmentation can be described with the Weibull-statistics using the tangential impact velocity. This shows that the fragmentation during oblique impaction is determined by the tangential velocity component. The reason for the differing behavior of spherical agglomerates could not be elucidated but it is hypothesized, that a transition from sliding to rolling during the impact occurs affecting the fragmentation behavior.The breakage pattern is obtained by analyzing the fragment size distribution as a function of the impact energy. For agglomerates with fractal dimensions of Df\u202f=\u202f1.6, 1.8, 2.3 and 2.6 a broad size distribution is observed containing small clusters/primary particles, bigger fragments and intact agglomerates at low impact energies. Increasing the impact energy shifts the whole fragment size distribution to smaller sizes. A nearly total disintegration at high impact energies is reached. The spherical agglomerates fracture into nearly equal sized fragments resulting in a narrower size distribution, which is shifted to smaller sizes at higher impact energies.",

Computed tomography data provided an ample amount of information to obtain a 3D arrangement of particles in a defined space for discrete element method simulations. However, during simulations, the residual forces initiate spatial disturbance of the particles which lead to their rearrangement, despite the fact that the particle assembly while scanning was in a static equilibrium. Further appropriate \u03bc CT data processing steps along with statistical analyses of the polydisperse particle system are therefore proposed to dissolve the paradox. Possible pitfalls of model development are identified and corrected by geometrical and physical constraints. It is observed that the frequency of particle contacts can be used to characterize the stability of a particle system. Thereby, a coherent and consistent model in the form of a stable particle assembly for discrete element simulations is successfully developed.",

Morphological and optical properties of the as-synthesized photocatalysts are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy. Photocatalytic degradation efficiency of methylene blue dye is investigated to examine the photocatalytic activity of synthesized photocatalysts. It is found that as-synthesized ZnO/CNSs composite can degrade higher methylene blue dye (\u223c85.6%) after 25\u202fmin of UV irradiation in comparison with that of CNSs. A prominent improvement in the photodegradation is attained by depositing metal (Ag) particles on the surface of ZnO/CNSs composite. AZCN composite displays the enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance (\u223c95% after 15\u202fmin of UV light) in high concentration of methylene blue dye. Furthermore, stability performance is studied by recycling the AZCN composite photocatalyst. It is found that the photocatalytic activity of AZCN composite is only slightly decreased even after five cycles.

Gas-solid fluidized beds are widely used in processes such as heating, cooling, drying, granulation, mixing, segregating and coating. To simulate the gas-particle flows, the unresolved surface CFD\u2010DEM was used considering Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian approach. The fluid phase was modeled by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) while the solid phase was solved by discrete element method (DEM), and the coupling between gas and solid phases was considered to be four-way. The uniform and pulsed flows were injected through three nozzles located at the bottom of a rectangular bed. Three types of pulsed flow were considered: sinusoidal, rectangular and relocating. The fluidized bed behavior was discussed in terms of minimum fluidization velocity (MFV), pressure drop, bubble formation, bed expansion, particles velocity and, gas-solid interaction and particle contact forces. The results of different simulations indicated that the minimum fluidization velocity of the beds fluidized by pulsed flows was decreased by up to 33%. The influence of the pulsation amplitude on the minimum fluidization velocity was more significant than that of the pulsation frequency. The bed expansion and particles average velocity were increased by the pulsed flows, while the pressure drop and interaction force were decreased. As the pulsation frequency increased, the pressure drop and gas-solid interaction force increased, although size of the bubbles and bed expansion decreased. It was also observed that in large vibration frequencies, the bubbles became more regular. In the sinusoidal flow, the velocity and contact force between the particles were initially increased by frequency and in larger frequencies they were decreased.",

The results showed that Ag/AgX photocatalysts have excellent photocatalytic performance for the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) pollutants under visible light illumination, and the photocatalytic activity maintains a high level after seven cycles. Metallic Ag0 particles nucleate on the surface of AgX uniformly through the thermal decomposition of residual AgNO3 solution, which enhanced the interaction between Ag0 and AgX. The outstanding photocatalytic activity benefits from the small size and high dispersion of Ag0 nanoparticles and the enhanced interaction between Ag0 and AgX.",

     "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been an extensive area of research owing to its depth of penetration for clinical diagnosis. Signal intensity under MRI is related to both T1, spin-lattice relaxation, and T2, spin-spin relaxation. To increase the contrast variability under MRI, several contrast agents are being used, i.e. T1 contrast agents (e.g. gadolinium) and T2 contrast agents (e.g. iron-based magnetic nanoparticles). These contrast agents are administered prior to scanning to increase contrast visibility. They reduce the T1 and T2 relaxation times to produce hyperintense and hypointense signals, respectively. Tunable properties of iron-based magnetic nanoparticles and several coating materials provide a platform to get superb MRI contrast in T2 weighted images. It has been found that contrast enhancement by iron-based magnetic nanoparticles is dependent on the size, shape, composition, surface, and magnetic properties which can be tuned with the synthesis method and coating material. Therefore, understanding the synthesis method and properties of magnetic nanoparticles is vital to contribute to MR signal enhancement which is directing the scientist to design engineered iron-based magnetic nanoparticles. This paper introduces the concept of MRI contrast enhancement. We mainly discuss the synthesis of T2 contrast agents, i.e. iron-based magnetic nanoparticles and the modification of these T2 contrast agents by coating followed by their biomedical applications.",

     "abstract": "Recently, reducing noble metals in electric devices has been identified as a key factor to lower product cost. Among these, noble metal coated particles are considered an alternative with the potential to dramatically reduce the usage of noble metals. A dense coating of noble metals over all surfaces is desirable for maintaining the properties of noble metal. However, our previous research showed that coated surfaces onto which the nanoparticles were attached were non-uniform because of evaporation of the raw materials. Therefore, in this study, we improved the coverage ratio of silver coated nickel particles using thermal plasma processing followed by ball mill pre-treatment. Silver and nickel particles were mixed using a ball mill, then injected into the thermal plasma jet. The silver particles were subsequently attached onto the surface of the nickel particles through ball mill processing, after which the silver attached nickel particles were melted through thermal plasma processing to produce silver coated nickel spherical particles. The cross section of the as-prepared particles showed a dense silver shell and nickel core, while the sintered body of the as-prepared particles showed the net-like silver covering over the nickel cores. These findings suggest that attachment of silver on nickel could lead to complete silver coatings by limiting the formation of nanoparticles.",

EDEM 2.7 commercial software was used as the DEM solver. The experiment and simulation results were found to be in a good agreement. The calibrated DEM model was then utilized to examine the effects of the impeller rotational speed, vessel fill level and particle loading arrangement on the overall mixing quality quantified by the relative standard deviation (RSD) mixing index. The simulation results revealed as the impeller rotational speed was increased from 10\u202fRPM to 40\u202fRPM, generally a better degree of mixing was reached for all particle loading arrangements and vessel fill levels. As the impeller rotational speed was increased further from 40\u202fRPM to 70\u202fRPM the mixing quality was affected, for a vessel fill level of 60% and irrespective of the particle loading arrangement. Increasing the vessel fill level from 40% to 60% enhanced the mixing performance when impeller rotational speed of 40\u202fRPM and 70\u202fRPM were used. However, the mixing quality was independent of vessel fill level for almost all simulation cases when 10\u202fRPM was applied, regardless of the particle loading arrangement. Furthermore, it was concluded that the particle loading arrangement did not have a considerable effect on the mixing index. ANOVA showed that impeller rotational speed had the strongest influence on the mixing quality, followed by the quadratic effect of impeller rotational speed, and lastly the vessel fill level. The granular temperature data indicated that increasing the impeller rotational speed from 10\u202fRPM to 70\u202fRPM resulted in higher granular temperature values. By evaluating the diffusivity coefficient and Peclet number, it was concluded that the dominant mixing mechanism in the current mixing system was diffusion.",

Four different heating conditions- uniform, sinusoidal and two different linear temperature distributions are applied on the left vertical wall of the cavity respectively, while maintaining the right vertical wall uniformly cooled and the horizontal walls thermally insulated. The two-phase thermal lattice Boltzmann (TLBM) model for nanofluid is extended to simulate nanofluid flow through a porous medium by incorporating the Brinkman\u2013Forchheimer-extended Darcy model. The close agreement between present LBM solutions with the existing published results lends validity to the present findings. The current results indicate that the uniform and bottom to top linear heating are found to be efficient heating strategies depending on Rayleigh number (103\u202f\u2264\u202fRa\u202f\u2264\u202f105) and Darcy number (10\u22121\u202f\u2264\u202fDa\u202f\u2264\u202f10\u22126).

There are three variants of the silo quaking phenomenon such as silo honking, silo shock and silo pulsation. Accelerometers are often used in practice to measure the responses of the structure. The accelerations generated by the silo structure during discharge are of non-linear and non-stationary nature. Therefore traditional algorithm, such as Fast Fourier Transform, which was designed to analyse linear and stationary signals and often used to analyse the collected acceleration data, is not suitable for signals generated by the silo structure during discharge. In the present research, Hilbert-Huang Transform and Hilbert Marginal Spectrum created by Norden Huang, a mathematician at NASA to analyse non-linear and non-stationary signals, were used to analyse the accelerograms collected from the experimental silo.

First, the effects of the three important simulation parameters, namely, the grid cell number, numerical particle-parcel size and time step, are investigated. Having determined the appropriate values for the three parameters, the hydrodynamic characteristics predicted by different drag force models are rigorously analyzed. The homogeneous drag models considered are the six models, the Wen-Yu, Wenyu-Ergun, Syamlal-O\u2019Brien, Gidaspow, HKL, and BVK models, while the four heterogeneous models considered are Sarkar and EMMS-based models (EMMS-Yang, EMMS-Matrix and EMMS-QL). For the riser 1 with the Geldart A particles, all the six homogeneous models predict extremely high solid fluxes and inconsistent void fraction distributions compared with experimental results. The heterogeneous Sarkar and EMMS-based models can effectively improve the simulation accuracy and predict a typical core-annulus flow structure. The lately-developed EMMS-QL model produces the most accurate solid flux. For the riser 2 with the Geldart B particles, both the heterogeneous and homogeneous drag force models can predict a reasonable flow structure. Further, there are no significant differences in the void fraction and velocity profiles due to the choice of a drag force model over the other. These drag force models also successfully capture the meso-scale local particle clusters. Of these drag-force models, the Wenyu-Ergun drag-forec model predicts comparatively accurate solid flux.

     "abstract": "Calcium carbonate exists in three allotropic forms: vaterite, aragonite and calcite. Metastable vaterite can be easily transformed into calcite and/or aragonite via different routes. We report how dry vaterite particles transform into aragonite and calcite when they are immersed into DeIonized water (DI) or tap water without additives at different temperature (22, 40 and 60\u202f\u00b0C) with and without stirring. We show that the transformation rate of vaterite into more stable crystallographic forms is influenced not only by temperature but also by stirring and water purity. Low temperature, absence of stirring and absence of ions in water significantly slow down the kinetics of transformation of vaterite. Additionally, water purity influences the nature of the allotropic phase obtained after transformation. High temperatures and DI water favor the transformation of vaterite into single crystalline nanowires of aragonite, while tap water yields the transformation of vaterite into calcite. The absence of aragonite in tap water at high temperature can be explained by the presence of sulfate ions, which inhibit the formation of this phase. On the contrary, Mg2+ ions tend to stabilize vaterite.",

In this study, NPP powders prepared by three commonly used methods were evaluated on their suitability for DC. Extensive characterizations of their physical properties were performed. Multivariate statistical analysis was utilized to explore the influence of preparation technology on the properties of NPP powders and identify the dominating factors that influence their DC properties. The results demonstrated that (i) the 27 kinds of model NPP powders selected randomly in this study could to some degree represent most NPP powders used in actual production; (ii) \u223c81.5% of the NPP powders exhibited both poor compactibility and flowability, and none of the NPP powders could be compacted into tablets via DC; (iii) the physical properties of NPP powders prepared by direct pulverization were significantly different from those of extracted ones, while there were no significant differences between the water and ethylalcohol extracted ones; and (iv) the DC properties of NPP powders could be improved through controlling some physical properties (e.g., density, particle size, morphology, and texture parameters) reasonably. Overall, this study comprehensively evaluated the current status and application of NPP powders in DC, and is significant in facilitating the development and modernization of NPPs through DC.",

This review summarizes the recent advances in the design and preparation of TiO2-based nanomaterials, nanocomposites, and nanoderivatives obtained from titanium glycolate precursor. Utilizing different fabrication strategies, titanium glycolate precursor with controllable morphology and size has been successfully produced, and it can be directly transformed into crystalline TiO2 nanomaterials through diverse post-treatments, including calcination thermal-decomposition, and refluxing, hydrothermal, and microwave treatment-assisted hydrolysis. Furthermore, doped TiO2, TiO2-composites, and other derivatives could be simply achieved by adding additional chemicals during transformation. The favorable properties of the resulting TiO2-based materials are also discussed, which are relevant to energy and environmental applications in the areas of dye-sensitized solar cells, lithium ion batteries, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, photocatalytic CO2 reduction, photocatalytic degradation, and adsorption removal of pollutants.",

     "abstract": "Dust management at longwall faces has always been a concern for mine operators. Recent respirable dust monitoring at a longwall top coal caving (LTCC) face indicated that extremely high dust exposure levels have been experienced at the face. Dust contamination from intake ventilation and the incorrect use of ventilation arrangements (i.e. curtains) at maingate (MG) area were identified as the main cause of this issue. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling studies were therefore conducted to investigate the impact of different ventilation arrangements on the dispersion behaviour of respirable dust at the LTCC face, with a special focus on the airflow patterns and the aerodynamics of fugitive dust at the intersection of MG and face. Field investigation was first carried out to observe the dust issue and obtain essential data for the development and validation of base model. Then parametric studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of two different curtain configurations at MG considering the worst scenario of intake dust contamination to face (dust from travel road and beam stage loader (BSL) discharge point flows towards face) with the shearer cutting into the MG. Model results demonstrate that the occurrence of flow separation and incorrect use of curtains account for the main reasons of high dust exposure level at the intersection of MG and face, especially when the shearer is cutting into the MG. Ventilation arrangements at the MG and face entry are critical to minimise the impact of flow separation on the dust flow patterns at the intersection. Based on model results, new ventilation arrangements at the MG and face entry have been proposed and evaluated through which significant dust mitigation effect can be achieved at face entry, contributing to the overall reduction of dust exposure levels along the face.",

The results obtained demonstrate that disk-like particles with a larger aspect ratio possess stronger particle movement and more apparent fluidization. Comparisons between spherical particles and disk-like particles elucidate their differences in the fluidization behavior. Particle orientation is also investigated in this paper due to its important influence on the fluidization. Particles possess different preferred orientations in the static bed and in the fluidization state, and a reduced aspect ratio can drive particles to be in the preferred orientation.

Based on the measured particle fluctuation velocities, continuous wavelet transform and one-dimensional orthogonal wavelet decomposition were applied to reveal particle dynamics in terms of time frequency analysis, the contribution from wavelet level to the particle fluctuation energy, spatial correlation and probability distribution of wavelet levels. The time frequency characteristics of particle fluctuation velocity suggest that the small-scale particle motions are suppressed and tend to transfer into large scale particle motions from acceleration regime to fully developed regime. In the near bottom part of pipe, the fluctuation energy of axial particle motion is mainly contributed from the wavelet levels of relatively low frequency, however, in the near top part of pipe, wavelet levels of relatively high frequency make comparable contribution to the axial particle fluctuation energy in the suspension flow regime, and this contribution decreases as particles are accelerated along the pipe. The low frequency wavelet levels exhibit large spatial correlation, and this spatial correlation increases as the particles flow from acceleration regime to fully developed regime. The skewness factor and kurtosis factor of wavelet level suggest that the deviation of Gaussian probability distribution is associated with the central frequency of wavelet level, and the deviation from Gaussian distribution is more evident as increasing central frequency. The higher wavelet levels can be linked to small sale particle motions, which lead to irregular particle fluctuation velocity.",

The different stages of the wire explosion were explained based on an analysis of the recorded signals and simple thermodynamic considerations.

     "abstract": "We numerically investigate the effects of restitution and specularity coefficients on the characteristics of dispersed gas-particle flows through a sudden expansion. The studies are carried out using an indigenous finite volume flow solver in a collocated framework with two-fluid model. Parametric studies are performed to gain insights into the differences in recirculation patterns that arise due to variations in restitution and specularity coefficients. The simulations show that particle-particle interactions, quantified by restitution coefficient (e) have a greater impact on recirculation characteristics than particle-wall interactions, which are quantified by specularity coefficient ( \u03d5 ). Studies reveal that the recirculation lengths tend to decrease as particle collisions become more elastic (as e tends to unity) while they increase, as the value of \u03d5 increases. However, the changes in recirculation length are very gradual and less pronounced when only particle-wall interactions are considered as compared to particle-particle interactions. From the range of parametric variations studied in this work, the maximum recirculation length has been found when the value of \u03d5 is maximum and that of e is minimum.",

Several mixing processes exist, this study is concerned with mechanical mixing of crystalline particles using a four-blade mixer. Although numerical investigations of mixing using four-blades have been conducted, the simplification of particle shape to spherical or rounded superquadric particle systems is universal across these studies. Consequently, we quantify the effect of particle shape, that include round shapes and sharp edged polyhedral shapes, on the mixing kinematics (Lacey Mixing Index bounded by 0 and 1) that include radial and axial mixing as well as the inter-particle force chain network in a numerical study. We consider six 100\u00a0000 particles systems that include spheres, cubes, scaled hexagonal prism, bilunabirotunda, truncated tetrahedra, and a mixed particle system. This is in addition to two six million particle systems consisting of sphere and truncated tetrahedra particles that we can simulate within a realistic time frame due to GPU computing. We found that spherical particles mixed the fastest with Lacey mixing indices of up to 0.9, while polyhedral shaped particle systems mixing indexes varied between 0.65 and 0.87, for the same mixing times. In general, to obtain a similar mixing index (of 0.7), polyhedral shaped particle systems needed to be mixed for 50% longer than a spherical particle system which is concerning given the predominant use of spherical particles in mixing studies.",

     "abstract": "In this work, a new method is presented to track discrete tracer particles in a two fluid model (TFM). This method is particularly useful for studying features of discrete particles, such as solids mixing. Following the implementation and verification of this method, its accuracy was studied. The results showed that the new method fulfills the continuity equation and it can represent individual solids motion very well. This method may suffer from false diffusion, which can be diminished by selecting a sufficiently small grid size. In addition, it has several advantages over other techniques, like simplicity, ease of implementation, straightforward processing and enabling the calculation of a mixing index based on the initial neighbor distance concept. Moreover, this method can open a new way to combine the TFM with Lagrangian approaches. After analyzing the strengths and drawbacks of our method and finding the proper simulation settings, the effects of superficial gas velocity and restitution coefficient on solids mixing were investigated. The results showed that the solids mixing is enhanced by increasing the gas velocity and/or decreasing the restitution coefficient. The observed trends can be attributed to altered bubble formation and dynamics. These results also confirm our earlier findings on the solids temperature distribution in fluidized beds for polyolefins production (Banaei et al., 2017).",

An advanced optical fiber probe technique was used to study the behavior of six essential local hydrodynamic parameters (i.e., local solids holdup, particles velocity, bubble rise velocity, bubble frequency, and bubble mean chord length) in the presence of vertical immersed tubes. The experimental measurements were carried out at six radial positions and three axial heights, which represent the three key zones of the bed: near the distributor plate, the middle of the fluidizing bed, and near the freeboard of the column. Furthermore, four superficial gas velocities (u/umf\u202f=\u202f1.6, 1.76, 1.96, and 2.14) were employed to study the effect of operating conditions. The experimental results demonstrated that the vertical internals had a significant effect on all the studied local hydrodynamic characteristics such that when using internals, both the solids holdup and bubble mean chord length decreased, while the particles velocity, bubble rise velocity, and bubble frequency increased. The measured values of averaged bubble rise velocities and averaged bubble chord lengths at different axial heights and superficial gas velocities have been compared with most used correlations available in the literature. It was found that the measured values are in good agreement with values calculated using predicted correlation for the case without vertical internals. While, the absolute percentage relative error between the measured and calculated values of these two hydrodynamic parameters indicate large differences for the case of vertical internals.",

As the filtration performance for a stationary filter has been extensively studied in the literature, the present work focuses on the effect of fiber oscillation in a filter where the fibers are allowed to vibrate periodically. The transport and deposition of dilute aerosol particles in such a system is simulated using an efficient numerical model, where an iterative immersed-boundary lattice Boltzmann method is applied to solve the background flow with finite-size moving fibers, and the motion of aerosol particles is then tracked by a one-way coupling Lagrangian approach. In the present scheme, the no-slip boundary condition at the fiber surface can be exactly enforced with an iterative approach and the numerical stability is improved by adopting the MRT collision model. After the model validation in the two special cases of flow over an oscillating fiber in a quiescent fluid and particle capture by a stationary fiber, the filtration performance of an oscillating multi-fiber filter is investigated to study the effects of fiber number, arrangement and vibration mode. It is found that the oscillating motion of fiber has significant influence on the filtration performance. For a single fiber, with larger oscillation amplitude, the distribution ranges of the release position and impact angle of captured particles both increase. On the other hand, a larger fiber oscillation frequency tends to reduce the width of release position but increase the width of impact angle of deposited particles. Furthermore, the collection efficiency is found to be linearly related to the oscillation amplitude or frequency. For multiple fibers, the collection efficiency always increases with larger fiber number, but it is a non-monotonic function of the arrangement parameters, i.e., the longitudinal and transverse spacings, and the vibration parameters such as the amplitude, frequency and vibration mode. It is interesting to find that the in-phase mode can usually lead to excellent collection efficiency.",

In this paper, it has been shown how the results of this analysis can be used for: (i) obtaining more accurate estimates of the breakage distribution parameters by performing just one short-duration batch grinding experiment, and (ii) explaining variation in the Bond Work index with the product size in terms of the exponent of particle size in the expression for the specific breakage rate function: k j = A \u2217 x j \u03b1 .",

     "abstract": "To investigate the effects of particle shape on the dispersion in an isotropic turbulent flow, herein two direct numerical simulations are performed. The six degrees of freedom motion of spherical and spheroidal particles in a vertical uniform flow and a gas-particle two-way isotropic turbulent flow. The former, which is investigated using a numerical simulation with the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Euler (ALE) method, shows that a spheroidal particle travels with rotating and oscillating motions, which significantly affect the pressure and the friction force on the particle\u2019s surface. The trend of the fluid force acting on the spheroidal particle\u2019s surface also oscillates and differs from that on a spherical particle. The time variation of the fluid force on the spheroidal particle is modeled in the C D equation, which has a sine curve\u2019s PDF relation with Re p and the particle\u2019s maximum and minimum C D values. The latter simulation examines the effects of the particle shape on the dispersion with the motion model developed above. The particle\u2019s dispersion behavior, which is analyzed by the statistical variable D and the Radial Distribution Function (RDF), shows that the dispersion motion is markedly affected by particle\u2019s sphericity, especially for particles with a relatively small sphericity. The results suggest that this difference can influence ignitability, flammability, and the concentration of combustible gases released by particles, and requires further study.",

     "abstract": "Undesired particulate agglomeration can create powder flow issues during manufacturing. Potassium chloride (KCl), a commercial product used in powder form as a potassium source, is known to agglomerate. The main objective is to develop a method to assess KCl agglomeration, then use it to understand its driving forces and the phenomena taking place. Based on industrial data in pharmaceutical manufacturing, the following 5 parameters are considered as critical in terms of agglomeration: conditioning humidity, conditioning time, drying, applied pressure and particle size. Beakers containing 40\u202fg of original or ground KCl powder are compacted under specific humidity conditions in a bell jar. Once the beakers are conditioned, agglomerate hardness tests evaluate agglomeration extent by correlating it with the energy required for powder penetration. This energy is calculated from force-distance curves. The results show that the Area Under the force vs distance Curve (AUC) is a good indicator of agglomeration extent. Thus, the AUC is a scalar and has units of work. Based on AUC analysis, the highest agglomeration is found in conditioning humidity of 85% relative humidity (RH), original particle size, drying and conditioning time of 16\u202fh. The agglomeration of original versus ground particle size powders is further investigated over time in a conditioning test. Preliminary tests validate our method and indicate that KCl premixing with other materials can solve agglomeration problems encountered during manufacturing processes as KCl-particle-particle interactions per unit volume are reduced.",

The ferrofluid flowing in the tube is exposed to the magnetic field generated by electrical current-carrying wire(s) along the tube, and the effect of such magnetic field is studied on heat and mass transfer phenomena. It is observed that due to the dependency of magnetization on temperature, the cold fluid flowing at the central regions of the tube is attracted more significantly towards the source of the magnetic field, which results in creation of secondary flow. Such mixing in the flow, subsequently, disturbs the thermal and hydrodynamic boundary layers, especially at the vicinity of the magnetic field source, leading to better heat transfer rate and also higher pressure drop. Furthermore, increasing the strength of the magnetic field leads to greater enhancement in heat transfer, while increasing the Reynolds number decreases the effectiveness of the magnetic field on the ferrofluid flow and heat transfer. Moreover, placing two wires above and under the tube can enhance the heat transfer even more significantly, such that the average convective heat transfer coefficient in this case is about 34.5% higher than that of the case without magnetic field.",

Solid solution phase with BCC crystal structure (a\u202f=\u202f2.89\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02\u202f\u00c5) has been confirmed from XRD and transmission electron microscopy in the as-synthesized high entropy alloy. The milled alloy powder is not thermally stable. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) thermogram of 30\u202fh milled powder exhibits the presence of a small peak at \u223c600\u202f\u00b0C (873\u202fK) with a thermal shift near the peak. This thermal shift indicates the diffusive type of phase transformation in this alloy while heating. The analysis of the in-situ heating X-ray diffraction patterns at various temperatures extends support to the diffusive nature of the phase transformation. Upon heat treatment, the disordered BCC solid solution phase partially transforms to Ni3Al prototype L12 phase which precipitates at a lower temperature (350\u202f\u00b0C (623\u202fK)) as observed by in-situ XRD experiments. However, at high temperature annealing (575\u2013800\u202f\u00b0C (848\u20131073\u202fK)) the evolution of a partially ordered BCC phase (B2) with lattice parameter (a\u202f=\u202f2.87\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02\u202f\u00c5), and L12 phase (a\u202f=\u202f3.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05\u202f\u00c5), along with tetragonal \u03c3 phase (a\u202f=\u202f8.8\u202f\u00c5 and c\u202f=\u202f4.53\u202f\u00c5) are observed. Similar types of phases have also been identified after annealing and microwave sintering at 800\u202f\u00b0C (1073\u202fK) & 900\u202f\u00b0C (1173\u202fK) respectively. The transformation of ordered BCC phases along with two intermetallics such as L12 phase and \u03c3 phase suggests that the evolution of the high entropy phase in the milled condition leads to a combination of high entropy and medium entropy phases in the annealed condition.",

Triangular and sinusoidal wall profiles along with varying concentration of nanoparticles are analyzed. The multi-phase mixture and the SST \u03ba-\u03c9 models are used to simulate turbulent nanofluid flows inside the corrugated channels. The staggered computational grid is employed for storing the velocity and pressure terms at cell faces and cell center, respectively. The governing equations are first discretized by employing a second-order upwind differencing technique and are then solved by means of pressure-based finite volume approach. The convergence criterion is also presented for the validation of obtained results. The effects of wall profiles and nanoparticle concentration on the pertinent parameters including Nusselt number, pressure drop, performance evaluation criterion (PEC), and thermal and frictional irreversibilities are studied. This reveals that, in general, the triangular duct features superior heat transfer and inferior hydraulic characteristics in comparison with the sinusoidal duct. It is demonstrated that as long as the base fluid (water) is used the highest value of PEC corresponds to the straight duct. Yet, by introducing nanofluids the PEC values of the corrugated ducts exceed those of the straight duct. The analysis further shows that on the basis of the performance evaluation criterion, the sinusoidal duct appears to be a better choice in comparison with the triangular duct. However, the situation is reversed when thermodynamic irreversibilities are considered. It is argued that vortex formation in the two investigated wavy walls and shear layer developed in the triangular case are the essential physical reasons for the observed thermal, hydraulic and entropic behaviors.",

Microstructures of alloy sintered by vacuum hot pressing (HP) are observed by optical microscope (OM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The prediction result by this theory is in good agreement with the experimental results. The enhanced sintering ability of powder containing appropriate fractions of coarse particle and fine particle is ascribed to the filling of fine particles to the voids between coarse particles, which enhanced the density of sample after sintering. Tensile behavior and the fracture morphology of alloys with various particle distributions are analyzed in details, suggesting the higher reliability of the present theory.",

DRS showed that the Fe doping in the TiO2 -activated carbon nano-composite induced a significant red shift of the absorption edge and then the band gap energy decreased from 3.3 to 2.9\u202feV. Photocatalytic results indicated that the photocatalytic activity of the Fe doped TiO2 increased under visible light irradiation in the presence of the activated carbon.",

     "abstract": "Monazite is a major rare earth elements (REE)-bearing phosphate mineral predominantly found in association with hematite and quartz in some Australian rare earth deposits. The flotation of rare earth oxides (REO) in monazite from mixtures containing monazite, hematite, and quartz with hydroxamic acid as a collector has been investigated using an IMN microflotation cell and a 1.2\u202fL Denver flotation cell. Maximum flotation recovery of both monazite and hematite was attained at pH 7, whereas that of quartz, at pH 3. The flotation kinetics data indicated the need for depressants to achieve selective REO recovery from hematite and quartz mixtures. Sodium silicate and starch were thus tested as depressants of both hematite and quartz. The separation efficiency of REO in the absence of depressants was low and averaged 6.42% at 99% REO recovery, but could be increased to 44.78% with corresponding 93% REO recovery when 4000\u202fg/t starch was used. However, the efficiencies of REO separation obtained with sodium silicate were generally lower (<18%), due to higher gangue minerals content in the flotation concentrates. A blend of sodium silicate and starch showed a good performance for REO recovery, with enhanced selectivity against hematite and quartz through a rougher-cleaner flotation test. This study presents the feasibility of upgrading REO from iron-oxide rich tailings using hydroxamic acid, in the presence of sodium silicate and starch as depressants.",

Sintering is a high-cost process, which can take several hours or days. Also, sintering at high temperatures can affect the microstructure of ceramics by causing undesired grain coarsening or changing the chemical stoichiometry of final product when volatile elements are present. In this study, a so-called \u201cnon-firing sintering\u201d of silica particles is proposed, without using thermal energy. This method involves the chemical activation of powder surface via ball milling, where the surface of particles is rubbed against balls, and friction between particle/ball breaks the bonds of functional groups like SiOSi on the surface of particles. Results show that water adsorption increases as milling time is increased, while particle size is unchanged after ball milling according to nitrogen adsorption isotherms. Scanning electron microscopy results confirm the trans granular fracture of pellets prepared by ball milling, and transmission electron microscopy micrographs show a necking-like bonding between silica particles.",

In this study, a novel effective oxygen control method is developed, for which vacuum degassing process is integrated with a flowing hydrogen reduction reaction at an elevated temperature before HIP. For this technique, a container is designed with two gas pipes for hydrogen inflow and outflow, so the hydrogen circulation can be established. Allowing hydrogen to react effectively with oxygen, the oxygen content of HIPed alloy is found to drop significantly from 140\u202fppm (raw powder) to 28\u202fppm, which is equivalent to the oxygen-free copper and copper alloys. As a result of the reduction, no prior particle boundaries could be observed in the low oxygen content material. Although the tensile strength of the materials with and without employing this technique does not vary significantly, the ductility of low oxygen content material has improved by about 70% at 500\u202f\u00b0C.

The investigation was carried out in situ using imaging and Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement techniques to obtain real-time chord length distributions. While particle aggregates were observed in the presence of PNIPAM only upon heating above the LCST, P(NIPAM-co-EXMA) induced particle aggregation below the LCST, due to the attraction between the xanthate moiety and the sulfide surfaces. The largest aggregates were observed with P(NIPAM-co-EXMA) (1.5 MDa), followed by PNIPAM, PAM, and P(NIPAM-co-EXMA) (115\u202fkDa). Particle aggregates formed with PAM did not exhibit further breakage under increasing shear to 1100\u202fs\u22121, while large-scale fragmentation was observed with the PNIPAM-based flocculants. Unlike PNIPAM, addition of P(NIPAM-co-EXMA) to suspension above the LCST was able to yield particle aggregation, attributed to the formation of charge-stabilised micelles. The influence of the shear rate on the size of the aggregates formed with P(NIPAM-co-EXMA) is unaffected by the polymer addition and measurement temperature below or above the LCST.",

     "abstract": "The Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) are powerful descriptors to evaluate interactions of (polymer) molecules and their solubility in different liquids. Although approaches do exist to transfer the HSP-concept to the question of dispersibility of particles, HSP determination of slowly sedimenting (nano)particles (NPs) is time consuming and depends on the subjective evaluation of the experimenter. Herein, we introduce a new method for HSP determination for colloidal systems using analytical centrifugation (AC) which was applied to standardize and accelerate the experimental procedure. However, as not dissolution but dispersion is in focus, we propose to use the term Hansen Dispersibility Parameters (HDP) instead of HSP whenever dispersibility and stability of particles against agglomeration/flocculation are to be discussed. First, we implemented a standard dispersion routine for the well-known, industrially highly relevant pigment carbon black (CB). Then, a standardized method for the evaluation of measured AC profiles and appropriate ranking of NPs dispersibility in different media was developed. We demonstrate outstanding reproducibility of our results by comparing HDP derived for the same CB material from independent experiments performed at two different affiliations. Finally, we show the predictive power of HDP and the accuracy of our approach by evaluating the dispersibility of CB in additional liquids and mixtures of so-called \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cpoor\u201d liquid media crossing the border from stable to unstable medium conditions. Our study evidences the enormous potential of AC to determine the HDP of colloidal systems using a standardized and non-subjective method to access particle interactions and colloidal stability.",

Moreover, by using a numerical scheme based on an iterative algorithm, 3D numerical simulations are performed for the homogeneous crystallization of calcium carbonate, and the results are compared with experimental particles size distributions and curves of pH versus time.

The rotational Reynolds number (Rer) bases on the angular velocity and the diameter of the spheres is used to characterize the rotational movement of particles. We studied the influence of Magnus lift force for particles with rotational Reynolds number in the range of 1\u2013100. Our results show that the influence of Magnus lift force is enhanced with a higher Rer. Magnus lift force affects the movement of particles in both radial and axial directions while Rer is high.

Apigenin was dissolved in organic solvent with micelle forming polymer Pluronic F-127 (PL-F127). Solid dispersion of apigenin-PL F-127 was developed using spray drying technique. Physicochemical and in vitro characterization of the produced solid dispersion particles were conducted using scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffractometry and dissolution study. In addition, in vivo study was performed for the spray dried versus pure and marketed apigenin. Cmax was found to be around 5 folds higher for spray dried product compared to non spray dried materials. The prepared drug:polymer formulation showed elongated particles and complete lack of crystallinity at 1:4 ratio. The change in the vibrational wave numbers strongly suggested the formation of hydrogen bonding between apigenin and PL F-127. Significant increase in the dissolution rate and bioavailability of the spray dried apigenin showed the potential of solid dispersion system to overcome problem related to BCS II drugs.",

High relative density Al-based composites (ABCs) reinforced with different volume fraction of CuZrAl particles have been fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The microstructures, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance in seawater solution of the ABCs were investigated. The sintered products are all composed of fcc-Al, Al3Zr and CuAl2 phases. For CuZrAl addition, bright and network precipitates are clearly observed in the Al matrix. On account of the interdiffusion of Al and Cu atoms between matrix and reinforcement, the ABCs present the good interfacial bonding. Compared with SPS-ed pure Al bulk, ABCs possess the excellent mechanical properties. It is mainly ascribed to the second phase strengthening, continuously distributed precipitates, high relative density or bonding interface, and grain refinement strengthening. Thereinto, combined with a degree of plastic strain, the composite with 20\u202fvol% CuZrAl reinforcement reveals the best micro-hardness (290\u202fHV), and the highest yield strength and fracture strength of 408 and 459\u202fMPa, respectively.

Consequently, directing this stream to the final product silo could be considered. Within the study, sampling survey was undertaken initially that was followed by the modelling and simulation works. The calculations implied that the production rate increased by 4.45% that corresponded to energy saving of 4.26%. As the plant decided to change the flow sheet, another sampling campaign was arranged to validate the outputs of the simulation studies. In that case, the real data showed that the increase in production rate was 3.68% and 28-Days strength of the cement improved by 2.9%. As a result, the simulation outputs were found to be in agreement with the real data hence the efficiency of the cement production, both quality and energy, for a given circuit was improved.",

A comparison between time-averaged simulation results and measurements, which were performed on an industrial spray drying installation, shows a good agreement.

Vapor emitted by reacting wet agglomerates below the sheds rises and causes shed fouling. The release of vapor from agglomerates can be estimated by combining the RPT results with a coking reaction model. The study found that the sheds reduce the time agglomerates spend in the shed zone, which in turn reduces the amount of organic vapor that reaches the sheds, but at the same time increase the wetness of the agglomerates that exit to the recirculation line, which results in the loss of valuable liquid. The research also found that the best type of shed, from the point of view of agglomerate motion, is the mesh-shed. Finally, experimental data indicate that reducing the cross sectional area of the sheds from 50% to 30% increases the time that the agglomerates spend above the shed zone, and thus reduces the flow of vapor emitted below the sheds.",

Therefore, understanding of the particle adhesion phenomenon by a dynamic liquid bridge is essential to adequately and precisely control wet granulation processes. This study presents a direct numerical simulation of the particle\u2013particle adhesion by a dynamic liquid bridge. Collision of a dry particle and a wet particle was simulated at various collision angles. In particular, translational and rotational motions of the particle at different collision angles were discussed through comparison with a conventional static liquid bridge force model. As a result, it was found that both translational and rotational motions were largely different between simulation results of the direct numerical simulation and static liquid bridge force model, especially at the tangential collision. To understand these results, we focused on the rotational behavior of the particle and deformation of the liquid bridge. It was concluded that the non-slip behavior of the liquid bridge on the particle surface is a key phenomenon for the particle-particle adhesion by the dynamic liquid bridge at the tangential collision.",

Experimental results demonstrate that breakage rate of coarse particles in mixture breakage increases if compared with that in single breakage. Particle size is modelled into classical breakage equation, and the modified model is successfully applied to mixture breakage. Energy split factor of component is determined based on the balance of specific energies of components in heterogeneous breakage and energy-size equation, and consumed energy (W) of component in multi-component grinding is calculated. Calculated energy split factors of components are all above one in various mixed conditions, so energy efficiency (value of product t10 at the same specific energy) decreases if compared with that of single breakage.

In the second phase, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to solve the calibration multi-objective optimization problem. In the third phase, the DEM simulations using the results of the calibrated input parameters are carried out to calculate the macroscopic responses that are then compared with experimental measurements for verification and validation.The proposed calibration framework has been successfully demonstrated by a case study with two-objective optimization for the model accuracy and the simulation time. Based on the concept of Pareto dominance, the trade-off between these two conflicting objectives becomes apparent. Through verification and validation steps, the approach has proven to be successful for accurate calibration of material parameters with the optimal simulation time.",

     "abstract": "Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the promising fuels for direct liquid fed fuel cells. However, CO poisoning is a major challenge for the development of effective catalytic system for formic acid electrooxidation (FAEO). Herein, a novel CO-resistive activated carbon supported Pd-MnOx bimetallic catalyst (Pd-MnOx/C) was presented for FAEO. Pd-MnOx/C catalyst was prepared via simple and reproducible surfactant-free deposition-reduction technique. The characterization of this novel Pd-MnOx/C catalyst was performed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), bright field transmission electron microscopy (BFTEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and scanning transmission electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX). The characterization results revealed that Pd and MnOx nanoparticles (NPs) were well dispersed and separately nucleated with a mean diameter of 2.9\u202fnm on the surface of active carbon. FAEO studies were performed on both Pd-MnOx/C and Pd/C catalysts to comprehend the effect of separately formed MnOx on the electrocatalytic activity of Pd NPs. The electrochemical measurements were carried out by using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Chronoamperometry (CA), CO-Strriping Voltammetry, Lineer Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Electrochemical results revealed that FAEO was activated by the addition of MnOx. Pd0.6-Mn0.4 exhibited the optimum catalytic activity with 1.05\u202fA/mg Pd current density. The sum of their results clearly points that the existence of MnOx NPs enhances the electrocatalytic activity of Pd NPs by increasing their CO-resistivity and durability throughout the FAEO.",

At a given initial gas velocity and particle mass loading, the interaction between gas and particles was studied at three different particle sizes. It was found that two main coherent vortex structures, circular eddy and hairpin eddy, distributed mainly in low speed area and heavy impingement area, respectively. The characteristics of particle motion in foursquare tangential jets correlated with gas turbulence dissipation, particle size, particle concentration and particle density. Small particles were easily entrained by gas vortex, so that they consumed more turbulence energy and attenuated the gas turbulence intensity. On the contrary, large particles had more inertia and led to heavier impingement in the chamber center, resulting in particle random distribution and complex momentum transfer between gas and particles. Moreover, large particles stretched the coherent vortex to be narrow and long, while small particles pulled down the vortices rotation intensity.",

In this paper, we numerically investigate the drag, lift and torque acting on a non-spherical particle in the vicinity of a planar wall by means of lattice Boltzmann simulations. To gain an exhaustive understanding of the complex hydrodynamics and study the influence of various geometrical and flow parameters, a single 2D elliptical particle is selected as our case study. In the simulations, the effect of particle Reynolds number, distance to the wall, orientation angle and aspect ratio on drag, lift and torque is studied. Our study shows that the presence of a wall causes significant changes in hydrodynamic forces, with increasing or decreasing drag and lift forces, depending on the distance from the wall. Even the direction of lift and torque may change, depending on both the distance from the wall and particle orientation angle. Also, an ellipse with higher AR experiences larger hydrodynamic forces and torque whatever the gap size and orientation angle.",

In addition, the non-contact measuring experiment is designed to verify the simulation results as well. The results indicate that the q/m of charged particle decreases as exponential relationship with the storage time, the remained q/m and its decay rate of particle with smaller size is lower during the whole process. The decay rate of charged powder increases with the increase of relative humidity in air. Particles with higher relative permittivity has a lower decay rate of charge, and the decay rate of particles with larger initial charge to mass ratio would also be higher.

To the best of our knowledge, these values are in the highest level as compared with other works. The high electrochemical performance of nickel sulfide sample originates from its thin thickness.",

When x\u202f=\u202f0\u201325, the powders show submicro fibrous morphologies, however, when x\u202f>\u202f25, some granular particles appear due to the weak coordination ability of ethylenediamine with Fe2+ in the oxalate precipitation process.

The results show that the peak of the mass density of the soot is distributed in the region where the gas temperature is higher than the unburned gas temperature of the mixture of volatile matter and air (1300\u20131400\u202fK) and lower than the flame temperature (2000\u202fK \u223c ). This is due to the fact that soot formation from the precursors (C2H2 and C6H6) is enhanced as the gas temperature increases, whereas the quantities of the precursors and the produced soot are reduced due to oxidation at the higher gas temperature condition that exists close to the flame. The peak value of the mass density of the soot is also distributed in the region between the peak values of the gas temperature and the probability density function of the number of coal particles.",

Geometrical analyses of the protuberance shapes provide some insight into the observed differences. Sharper protuberances reduced yield (promoting breakage and attrition) but tended to give narrower size distributions and less even pellet surfaces. The pellet yield for 1\u202fmm extrudates was also subject to losses caused by fragments passing through the 1.0\u202fmm gap between the plate and the spheroniser wall. Pellet tensile strengths were noticeably greater for 1.0\u202fmm diameter extrudates, which is attributed to the greater extensional strain imparted on the paste during the extrusion step.

The 50% SnO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions exhibit the best performances for photodegradation of rhodamine B under solar light, which is attributed to the effective interfacial contact between SnO2 and g-C3N4, leading to the increased charge transfer and prolonged charge-hole separation time. Moreover, SnO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions possess excellent stability after 4 recycling runs, because the face-to-face contact interface provides a large contact area, thus forming a close combination of two phases and guaranteeing effective separation of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is analyzed and it is demonstrated that the hydroxyl radical species play an important role for the photocatalytic activity.

The results revealed that hydrothermal synthesis conditions generally affected the nucleation rate, particle size, textural properties and acidic nature of ZSM-5 catalysts. It was found that pure ZSM-5 materials with high crystallinity could be obtained at specific crystallization conditions of about 300\u202f\u00b0C for 1.5\u202fh and also 350\u202f\u00b0C for 0.5\u202fh.

The catalytic performance of samples was studied for conversion of methanol to light olefins under different reaction conditions. Interestingly, the proper pore geometry along with the strong intrinsic acidity resulted in a tendency for excessive production of light olefins for ZSM-5(350-0.5) catalyst. The selectivity of light olefins over this catalyst was increased about 94% in the long time on stream (2100\u202fmin).

The Sisko fluid model together with small particles is considered in the presence of extrinsic magnetic field and chemical reaction. It is well-known that different biological fluids behave like a Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluid depending upon the shear rates. The non-Newtonian fluid models are more complicated than Newtonian fluid and difficult to express using the single constitutive relationship between stress and strain rate. These constitutive equations provide a complex mathematical formulation and become numerous challenges to find numerical and analytical solutions. Small magnetic particles are helpful to manipulate and control the two-phase flow by magnetic force. Moreover, it is also beneficial in drug targeting for the treatment of different diseases. Further, two-phase flow plays an important role to examine the muscular expansion and contraction during the propagation of various biological fluids. An appropriate approximation is considered such as long wavelength and creeping flow regime to model the governing equations. Analytical solutions are obtained using the perturbation method. Moreover, numerical computations are performed to determine the features of peristaltic pumping. The results of different rheological properties for particle and fluid phase are discussed mathematically as well as graphically for different sundry parameters. The current analysis has an extensive amount of applications in medical engineering and also significant importance of smart fluid pumping systems in various engineering processes.",

Low band gap gray Zn/ZnO colloidal nanoparticles were fabricated by plasma-liquid interaction of DC arc discharge in water. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and UV\u2013vis spectroscopy were employed for morphology, crystal structure and optical characterizations respectively. Optical emission spectroscopy was used to investigate the plasma properties during the synthesis and formation mechanism of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles with different size and shape were fabricated only by adjusting discharge current during synthesis without introducing any chemical agent. Electric discharge current was set to 20, 50, 100 and 150\u202fA during synthesis. Estimated values of plasma excitation energies were 2.41, 2.66, 2.86 and 3.04\u202feV and diameter size of nanoparticles were 63, 42, 37 and 29\u202fnm for these applied currents respectively. Synthesized nanoparticles were dark gray as prepared and became more transparent gradually getting white color finally. XRD and UV\u2013vis results revealed that the oxidation process was time dependent. The colloidal nanoparticles composed of two metal and metal-oxide phase and white crystalline ZnO was achieved after complete oxidation process. These results provided a flexible and versatile method to synthesize metal oxide nanoparticles with controlled composition.",

The results indicated that the \u03bcs,pt mainly affects the axial motion while the \u03bcs,pp primarily influences on the circular motion. The residence time is strongly affected by the uniformity of axial motion while the collision energy is significantly influenced by the uniformity of circular motion.

Although the multiple sphere method (MSM) is the most popular approach to describe non-spherical particle shape, the validity of the MSM has not been established yet. The purpose of this study is to examine the validity and adequacy of the MSM. A uni-axial confined compression test was designed and set up to study the mechanical behaviour of an ellipsoidal granular assembly under vertical loading and the load transfer to the contacting boundary. Four levels of multi-sphere approximation for an axi-symmetric ellipsoidal particle were employed in DEM simulation to investigate the adequacy of multi-sphere approximation. A comparison on compression characteristics between the numerical and experimental results was made and discussed in this paper. Most of the compared physical properties showed reasonable agreement, indicating that capturing the key linear dimensions of a non-spherical particle may be sufficient to predict reasonable results. A small number of sub-spheres (say, N\u202f\u2265\u202f5) for representing an axi-symmetric ellipsoidal particle can give plausible results. However, the DEM simulations also produced a certain extent of discrepancy in loading stiffness with experiments. Plausible explanations are provided and require further investigation.",

Forced convective heat transfer and entropy generation of aqueous Al2O3 nanofluid with temperature dependent properties were investigated. Eulerian two-phase mixture model was employed for nanofluid modeling and governing mass, momentum, energy, and volume fraction equations were solved using finite volume method. Simulations covered a range of nanoparticle volume fraction of 1\u20133%, Reynolds number from 200 to 2000, and curvature ratio of 0.05\u20130.2. In order to evaluate the heat transfer performance, a parameter referred as thermo-hydrodynamic performance index was applied. Also, entropy generation analysis was performed to examine the efficiency of the helical coil and nanofluid. The results demonstrate that performance index enhances by decreasing the Reynolds number and the increasing nanoparticle concentration. The best thermo-hydrodynamic performance can be obtained at low Reynolds number, high nanoparticle volume fraction, and large curvature ratio. Increasing curvature ratio decreases the ratio of local entropy generation by nanofluid to the base fluid. So, utilization of water based Al2O3 nanofluid in higher curvature ratio is more efficient from irreversibility point of view.",

In addition, the removal ratio of the fungal spores on substrates coated with silica nanoparticles was higher than that on plasma-treated glass.

It has been found recently that so-called nanofluids, i.e. dilute water-Cu or water-Al2O3 suspensions with a particle diameter of 100\u2013150\u202fnm, are highly efficient coolants. Numerical simulations can help to optimize the microchannel structures and typically homogenous single-phase models are applied. However, these underestimate the experimental results. An alternative approach is two-phase models based on an Eulerian approach for the base fluid and a Lagrangian description of the suspended particles. In this paper we follow that route and solve the three-dimensional governing equations including continuity, Navier-Stokes and energy equations with the well-known SIMPLE method. The governing equations for particles are solved by a 4th order Runge-Kutta algorithm. We focus on a wavy microchannel structure and demonstrate that the disagreement between the two simulation approaches is due to the non-homogeneous particle distribution in the domain. We also find that the Nusselt number increases with the increase in volume fraction and the decrease in particle diameter and that it. is about three times higher for a nanofluid in a wavy microchannels as compared to water in a straight microchannels.",

The influence of vibration on characteristic gas velocity in flow pattern transition stage was experimentally investigated at a vibration amplitude range of 0.5\u20134\u202fmm and frequency range of 5\u201335\u202fHz. The experimental results demonstrate that at a low frequency (f\u202f<\u202f10\u202fHz), the vibration effect results in a denser bed and a slightly smaller initial fluidization gas velocity. As the vibration frequency increases to a level similar to the bed\u2019s natural frequency, the minimum fluidization gas velocity reduces sharply. The minimum fluidization gas velocity correlation in the VDMFB is obtained by means of theoretical deduction and experimental data fitting. Furthermore, a method is proposed for evaluating the effects of vibration on improving fluidization quality. Based on that, using the coal separation probable error E p \u2a7d 0.1 as the evaluation index, a suitable effective operating gas velocity range for coal separation under different vibration parameters is determined. The ratio of the boundary operating gas velocity to U mfc is 0.67\u20132.28. Thus, a uniform and stable fluidization environment is provided for dry fine coal separation.",

Therefore, a three dimensional model of the upper part of COREX shaft furnace is developed in the present study. The model simulates the charging process with multiple rings and is then used to investigate the effects of different bottom base shapes on the burden profiles and radial size distributions. Results show that the last rings (the inner rings) in the burden matrix needs be carefully chosen, especially for the middle mode. The bottom base shape affects the burden size distribution a great deal but the surface burden profile very little at a fixed burden matrix. A bottom base of M shape is strongly recommended to obtain a uniform burden size distribution. The burden matrix and bottom base shape need to be well matched in order to obtain desired gas distributions.",

Extensive investigations have been done on pressure-temperature equilibrium behavior of hydrate formation and dissociation at varying concentrations of calcium carbonate. Hydrate formation rate was found to vary with concentration of calcium carbonate as the solubility of calcium carbonate in water is controlled by the presence of simultaneous chemical equilibria involving a high number of species like Ca2+, CO32\u2212, HCO3\u2212, CO2, etc. Induction time for hydrate formation has also been measured at different concentrations of carbonate. Nucleation point for the hydrate formation was observed to be slightly higher at higher concentration of calcium carbonate due to increased heat absorption. Dissociation enthalpy of hydrates was calculated by using Clausius-Clapeyron at different measured conditions. Moles consumption of methane gas during hydrate formation at different concentrations of carbonate was measured using real gas equation and found to be minimum at 10\u202fwt%.",

We used a mixed experimental-simulation approach to correlate the kinetic parameters of leaching to the collision energy during grinding. The effect of milling was studied by scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Results showed that both high-intensity grinding techniques resulted into a dramatic decrease of particle size. Furthermore, under specific grinding conditions, the planetary ball milling determined also the partial amorphization of covellite. The collision energies corresponding to specific grinding conditions in terms of rotational speed and number of grinding media were assessed by DEM simulations and were related to the specific surface area after grinding. The specific surface area of grinded samples was found to be directly proportional to the collision energy in grinding. The leaching of the ore occurred through three subsequent steps: (i) dissolution of copper sulfate, (ii) dissolution of amorphousized covellite and (iii) dissolution of residual crystalline covellite. The results of kinetic fitting highlighted an increase of the rate constants for the leaching of amorphous and crystalline covellite by intensifying the milling conditions. By correlating the collision energies from DEM simulation with the leaching rate constants, we confirmed that the rate constants for the leaching of covellite increased due to an occurred mechanochemical reaction. The mechanochemical reaction that determined the partial amorphization of covellite occurred above 0.25\u202fJ/s\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0g. On the other hand, the rate constants for the leaching of the residual crystalline covellite constantly and progressively increased with the collision energy, thus highlighting an improvement of leaching due to an increase of surface area.",

The data were correlated using the Chrastil equation and the M\u00e9ndez-Santiago and Teja equation. The average deviations for calculated and measured solubilities were approximately 10%.

The effects of SAS operating parameters were compared and discussed including the operating temperature, operating pressure, solution concentration, spraying nozzle diameter, CO2 flow rate, and solution flow rate. The experimental results proved that low operating temperatures, high solution concentrations, high CO2 flow rates, and low solution concentrations produce small warfarin crystals, whereas the effects of operating pressure and spraying nozzle diameter are negligible.

The layered aluminophosphates were formed in amorphous gels, so that they were obtained as precipitates. Upon dispersing the precipitates to water under agitation, the layered aluminophosphates were transferred to the aqueous phase, resulting in transparent aqueous sols. Because they had bulky interlayer cation TMA+, it is likely that in the sols, layered aluminophosphates were exfoliated, providing aluminophosphate nanosheets. Moreover, their characterization results suggest that the layered compound formed at 170\u202f\u00b0C consisted of aluminophosphate layers with kanemite-like structure. Furthermore, the prolonged hydrothermal treatment at 170\u202f\u00b0C led to the formation of microporous ATT-type AlPO4 crystals. Under the synthesis condition employed in this study, layered aluminophosphates were formed at early stage, and then structurally converted to microporous AlPO4 crystals.",

Instead of conical part, the separation space of this cyclone consists of an outer cylinder and a vortex limiter. The Reynolds averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations with Reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM) are solved by use of the finite volume method based on the SIMPLE pressure correction algorithm in the computational domain. The Eulerian-Lagrangian computational procedure is used to predict particles tracking in the cyclones. The velocity fluctuations are simulated using the Discrete Random Walk (DRW). In the results the effects of number of inlets on the different important parameters such as pressure drop, collection efficiency, axial velocity and turbulence are investigated and deeply discussed. Contours of velocity, pressure and turbulent kinetic energy within these cyclones with different number of inlets are shown. The results show that the cyclone with three inlets has more collection efficiency, less pressure drop and less turbulence distribution with respect to cyclones with one and two inlets which is good in cyclones performance.

     "abstract": "Although high-pressure gas atomization has been widely used for the large-scale production of fine metal powders, high operating costs remain one of its biggest issues. The key to efficiency lies in how to strengthen the gas/molten metal interaction. Despite this, most of the extensive previous studies have focused on evaluating various nozzles by flow visualization and the size measurement of the resulting powder. It is known that strong shock waves are inevitably produced by a pressure mismatch through the nozzle, however the effect of those shock waves on gas flow and breakup behavior is still unclear. The purpose of this numerical simulation study was to determine whether any efficient paths for maximizing the gas-melt interaction exist, and to elucidate possible effects of the shock waves. Two types of supersonic nozzles were employed for the simulations: an annular slit nozzle, versus an isentropic plug nozzle working in shock-free mode. Single particle analysis was performed by injecting a single coarse droplet at different locations near the nozzle exit and then monitoring the local gas velocity and breakup characteristics along its path. The same path-resolved analysis was repeated for continuous droplet injection under various gas-to-melt ratios. The results indicate that more efficient paths exist for the maximal use of gas kinetic energy, and that shock waves are detrimental to producing smaller sized powders.",

Microstructural mechanism in term of SEM microscopy, EDX analysis, and XRD patterns of CL-FA pastes were examined. The following properties of cement-free concrete were also examined: heat generation, compressive strength, elastic modulus, and splitting tensile strength. The results of microstructural revealed that the products of binder made from CL and FA were C-S-H and C-A-S-H phase types and the formations of C-S-H and/or C-A-S-H were attributed to components of Al, Si, and Ca.

In current study, BBR pellets of acceptable size and shape quality (for capsuling) are generated by extrusion-spheronisation. Compared to commercial BBR tablets, the BBR pellets show significant sustained drug release behaviour which is expected to improve the pharmacokinetic behaviour of BBR and thus enhance its oral bioavailability. Experimental results indicate that not only the pellet size but also the excipient permeability plays an important role in pellet drug release behaviour. Low field-nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) is used, for the first time, to investigate and compare water diffusion rate and water distribution in pellet-release medium systems. It is found that the water diffusion rate is dominated by pellet surface area, while the total amount of water diffusing into pellets is mainly related to excipient permeability.

     "abstract": "The discrete element method (DEM) has proven to be a powerful tool to simulate processes involving particulate material. When simulating materials handling operations that lead to mechanical degradation as well as several types of crushers and mills, description of particle breakage inside the DEM environment becomes indispensable, since flow of solids, energy transfer and size reduction are deeply intertwined. However, breakage modeling in DEM is still in an earlier stage of development and comparatively limited work has been carried out demonstrating the validity and limitations of the various models pursued in the literature and already available in commercial DEM packages. The work analyzed particle breakage using three models available in commercial DEM simulation platforms: the bonded-particle model (BPM), the particle replacement model (PRM) and the fast-breakage model (FBM). These were initially calibrated on the basis of the distribution of breakage probabilities of individual 6.3\u20134.75\u202fmm copper ore particles and, whenever possible, progeny size distributions. Breakage of particles in beds by impact by a falling steel ball is an interesting case for testing breakage models, besides an important microprocess in some comminution operations, since particles interact with each other and with the grinding medium. As such, the potential of the three models to describe size reduction was demonstrated through comparison of unconfined particle bed breakage experiments and simulations. The models demonstrated different abilities to describe the various aspects of breakage. The work then identified opportunities for improvement in each of the models.",

Spherical shape micro-crystalline cellulose particles serve as an experimental pendant to measure the particle size distribution (PSD) and to calibrate the micro-mechanical material properties entering in the DEM calculations. At first, the die filling process of the particles having poly-dispersity in size is explored by analyzing the basic metrics such as tablet mass, tablet mass variation, and mass flow rate. Particle size segregation is investigated by computing the PSD development in different locations of the feeding system and in the filled dies. In addition, particles\u2019 velocity and coloring analysis (both qualitative and quantitative) are performed. Results show that different zones of the system are involved in various powder flow phenomena constituting varying particle size segregation causes. Next, the micro-mechanical properties, namely inter-particle cohesion, particle-particle and particle-wall friction, are varied one at a time to shed light on their influence on the particle size segregation and tablet quality. Finally, the influence of different material properties on various metrics are compared with each other providing a guide towards formulation optimization resulting in optimal tableting process performance.",

     "abstract": "Coating of particulate solids is a well-known process within the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industry. Most of these industries use it to achieve a defined product behavior. Melt-coatings, in this paper beeswax, carnauba wax and palm fat, are more difficult to apply compared to solvent-based coatings because of the complex solidification behavior.This contribution focuses on the experimental investigation of the crystallization process. The thermal crystallization behavior of mixtures of beeswax, carnauba wax and palm fat is investigated to determine the processability and the achievable coating quality prior to lab trials. Mixing of the melts results in a broadening of the crystallization temperature range, making the process more challenging. The rheological behavior in the phase transition of different mixtures shows a rather sudden change in the flowability contrary to the extended thermal solidification. The sudden change is a consequence of the linking of the appearing crystals, which was visualized at different solidification temperatures by polarization microscopy. The Martens hardness of the solidified material was adjusted by blending between 2 and 17\u202fN/mm2. The coating was applied in a lab-scale fluidized bed based on parameters determined from the characteristics. A micro-computed tomography image shows a closed coating of varying thickness. It was possible to predict the coating process with these natural products out of the material properties, and adapt them by blending. Furthermore the results of this contribution show that there is a gap between the pure processabilty and the achievable coating quality.",

Using a self-designed simulation system, the multi-radial vortex airflow migration and dust diffusion rules were experimentally investigated. As to the airflow migration, it was easier to form the dust suppression air curtains with uniform airflow distribution at a longer distance away from the head-on section (Lvortex), under smaller forced-to-exhaust ratio (Y), forced air flow rate (Qforced) and axial-to-radial-ratio (Z), with the airflow pointing to the head-on section. As to the control of dust diffusion, the dust concentration decreased gradually with the increase of Lsection. As the distance away from the head-on section increased, the control capacity of dust diffusion firstly weakened and then strengthened. The smaller values of forced-to-exhaust ratio and axial-to-radial ratio and the larger forced air flow rate would be beneficial to the control of dust diffusion.

The stability of the aqueous foams generated by nitrogen bubbling thorough the PNIPAM nanogel dispersion was investigated below and above the LCST of PNIPAM. The foam prepared below the LCST was stable in some degree, whereas almost no foam was formed above the LCST. Moreover, the foam prepared below the LCST was quickly collapsed by changing the temperature above the LCST. This rapid defoaming represents that the surface activity of the PNIPAM nanogel can be switched off by the temperature increase across the LCST.",

The governing equations have been solved using an in-house FORTRAN code, based on finite volume method. Single-phase and standard k-\u03b5 models have been used for nanofluid and turbulent modeling, respectively. The internal fluid has been considered as hot fluid (nanofluid) and the external fluid, cold fluid (base fluid). The effects of nanoparticles volume fraction, flow direction and Reynolds number on base fluid, nanofluid and wall temperatures, thermal efficiency, Nusselt number and convection heat transfer coefficient have been studied. The results indicated that increasing the nanoparticles volume fraction or Reynolds number causes enhancement of Nusselt number and convection heat transfer coefficient. Maximum rate of average Nusselt number and thermal efficiency enhancement are 32.7% and 30%, respectively. Also, by nanoparticles volume fraction increment, the outlet temperature of fluid and wall temperature increase. Study the minimum temperature in the solid wall of heat exchangers, it can be observed that the minimum temperature in counter flow has significantly reduced, compared to parallel flow. However, by increasing Reynolds number, the slope of thermal efficiency enhancement of heat exchanger gradually tends to a constant amount. This behavior is more obvious in parallel flow heat exchangers. Therefore, using of counter flow heat exchangers is recommended in higher Reynolds numbers.",

The adsorption of grinding aid molecules on the product particle surface is a common measure to handle these effects. To ensure an efficient grinding aid application, the impacts of additives on particle and bulk properties, which influence the micro-processes inside the mill, need to be understood. Within this study the effects of several grinding aids on dry fine grinding of limestone in a laboratory vibration mill were investigated. Unlike in many other scientific works, the impacts of grinding aids were analyzed on different levels simultaneously: Grinding success and agglomerate size distributions were evaluated by wet and dry particle size measurements, respectively. Additionally, material coating on the grinding media, powder flowabilities and particle specific surface energies were measured. It was shown that all of the investigated grinding aids influence the grinding efficiency. However, the formation of agglomerates is not necessarily linked to the product fineness. Furthermore, a strong impact of certain grinding aids on the flowability of the product powder was determined. Thereby, the bulk flow behavior also determines the grinding result as it affects the stress mechanism inside the mill. Moreover, a direct relation between surface energy and powder flowability as well as agglomeration behavior could be demonstrated.",

This paper examined a novel application of pig bone waste for the synthesis of HAp via heat treatment between 600 and 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. Thus synthesized powder was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD results revealed the main characteristic peaks of single phase HAp powder, while the presence of various functional groups such as PO43\u2212, CO32\u2212 and OH\u2212 corresponding to HAp were observed by FT-IR analysis. The elemental composition of as-synthesized HAp powder as observed by EDX showed the presence of Ca and P in addition to some beneficial metals such as Na, K, Mg and Si which plays vital roles in biological applications. SEM and TEM observation confirmed the microscopic sctructure of the as-synthesized HAp to be rod-like morphology with 38\u201352\u00a0nm in length. Porous HAp scaffold up to 65% porosity could be prepared using ammonium bicarbonate as pore forming agent.

     "abstract": "To elucidate the role of alloying metals such as Ni, Cu and Cr in weathering steels on the formation of \u03b1-FeOOH rust by atmospheric corrosion of the steels in industrial and urban districts, influence of alloying metal ions on the formation, morphology and adsorption properties of \u03b1-FeOOH particles synthesized by aerial oxidation of neutral FeSO4 solution was examined. The addition of Cu(II) and Cr(III) dramatically suppresses the crystal growth of \u03b1-FeOOH and turns the rod-shaped \u03b1-FeOOH particles into nano-sized irregular ones. Besides, increase of amount of added Cr(III) forms the iron oxyhydroxysulfate named as Schwertmannite (Fe8O8(SO4)(OH)6). Whereas, the Ni(II) addition shows no noticeable influence on the growth of \u03b1-FeOOH crystal and particles. These results imply that the inhibitory effect of crystal and particle growth of \u03b1-FeOOH is in order of Cr(III)\u202f>\u202fCu(II)\u202f>>\u202fNi(II). The adsorption of CO2 gas on the \u03b1-FeOOH particles is impeded by adding Cu(II) and Cr(III). Whereas, the formation of Schwertmannite by adding Cr(III) enhances the CO2 and SO2 adsorption. These results suggest that alloying Cu and Cr in weathering steels inhibit the crystal and particle growth of \u03b1-FeOOH to accelerate the formation of protective rust layer composed of fine \u03b1-FeOOH and/or Schwertmannite rust particles on the steels in urban and industrial atmosphere.",

The novel abrasive particles with special mechanical and/or tribochemical properties have been introduced into CMP processes for the improvement of surface quality and finishing efficiency. In this work, the composite particles containing solid silica (sSiO2) cores and mesoporous silica (mSiO2) shells were prepared via a developed St\u00f6ber method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a structure-templating surfactant. The as-synthesized core/shell structured sSiO2/mSiO2 composite particles were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption\u2013desorption measurements. The effect of the sSiO2 core size of the composite particles on oxide CMP performance was evaluated in terms of surface roughness and material removal rate (MRR). The root-mean-square surface roughness (0.15\u20130.31\u00a0nm) of the polished substrates slightly increased with increasing of the sSiO2 core size (168\u2013353\u00a0nm) of the composites with a comparable mSiO2 shell thickness (16\u201318\u00a0nm). The sSiO2/mSiO2 composite particles with a relatively smaller or larger core presented a relatively high MRR for silicon oxide films. These oxide CMP results could be rationalized according to the contact area mechanism and indentation-based mechanism, incorporating the total contact area and chemical reactivity between particles and wafers, and the indentation depth of an abrasive particle onto the substrate surface.",

In the first step, the effect of refluxing time on structure and morphology of the pristine ZnO nanostructures was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicated that the pristine ZnO nanostructures were formed after 8\u202fh of the refluxing process. Field emission electron microscope (FESEM) images showed that stars-shape ZnO nanostructures were formed after 10\u202fh of refluxing time. Further refluxing process for 12\u202fh showed that morphology and structure of the ZnO nanostructures were not changed. However, after 14\u202fh additional phases were formed. Therefore, ZnO and Zn(1\u2212x)MgxO nanostars that were decorated on GO sheets were synthesized during 10\u202fh. XRD patterns indicated that GO sheets were changed into reduced graphene oxides (rGO) during the refluxing process. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images revealed that ZnO nanostars with more branches were decorated on rGO sheets. However, the TEM images showed that the morphology of ZnxMg(1\u2212x)O/rGO nanocomposites were changed significantly with the increase of Mg concentration up to 6%. Photocatalytic performance of the products was examined under natural sunlight irradiation.

The tribocharger consists of a PTFE charging tube and a rectangular separation chamber where an electric field is applied between two electrodes. The particles are conveyed through the charging tube and charged by frictional contact with the tube wall. It is shown that different gas flow rates at a turbulent flow regime in the charging tube did not change the separation characteristics. In contrast, increasing electrical field strength increases separation efficiency of protein particles regardless of gas flow conditions.

Use of porous fins, instead of solid ones, improves conduction while could have negligible effect on convection as flow can pass through them. Therefore, the effects of the number of fins and their length on heat transfer enhancement and entropy generation are scrutinized. The study has been conducted for the certain pertinent parameters of Rayleigh number (Ra = 10 4 to 10 6 ), Darcy number (Da = 10 - 1 to 10 - 4 ), and the nanoparticle volume fraction ( \u03c6 = 0 to 0.04 ) and results are investigated in terms of heat transfer, entropy generation and performance coefficient (PEC). Numerical results indicate that adding porous fins with a high Darcy number improves heat transfer while fins with a low Darcy number can weaken the convection and decline Nusselt number. In strong flow fields an increase in either the length or the number of fins has insignificant effect on Nu. Also, low concentration of nanoparticles enhances the heat transfer more than high values of nanoparticles. On the other hand, entropy generation decreases by increasing the number of fins and PEC enhances by using porous fins in most of the studied cases. PEC of pure fluid is higher than the nanofluid at low Ra numbers, while opposite fact is observed for high Ra values.",

Experimental measurement of thermal conductivity is time consuming, laborious and expensive. One of the common ways to address these limitations involves developing theoretical models to study thermo-physical properties of nanofluid. However, most classical and empirical models fail in predicting experimental results with good precision. In this study, we developed support vector regression (SVR) models that are capable of predicting the thermal conductivity enhancement for metallic and metallic-oxide nanofluids. The accuracy and reliability of the developed models were assessed using statistical parameters such as correlation coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The models were characterized with very high correlation coefficients of 99.3 and 96.3% for the metallic and metallic oxide nanofluids, respectively. While the RMSE obtained were 1.11 and 1.33 for the metallic and metallic oxide nanofluids, respectively. In addition, the results of the models were compared with Hamilton-Crosser (HC) model and other empirical models. The SVR models performed much better than all the models examined. Furthermore, the effects of temperature, volume fractions, nanoparticle size and type, and basefluids types were correlated with experimental data in order to assess the performance of the developed models. The results indicate that SVR predictions were accurate and better than common theoretical models.",

The mixture containing only paraffin wax produced the best trade-off between high moldability and low segregation for an injection process requiring an extended time range between injection and solidification of the part (e.g. up to 10\u202fmin). For a short processing time (e.g. <1\u202fmin spent in molten state), the feedstocks containing paraffin wax with stearic acid or small amount of ethylene vinyl acetate can be also considered as good candidates for LPIM process because their viscosity and segregation potential are relatively low.",

     "abstract": "Planetary ball mills at laboratory scale are widely used for grinding and alloying processes. However, in contrast to other mill types, no applicable mechanistic model exists to describe the stressing conditions and their effect on particle breakage, so that processes are empirically evaluated so far. Within this study, the stressing conditions are determined by simulations based on the discrete element method including the contact model of Hertz and Mindlin. The contact model parameters are carefully calibrated by a series of experiments, so that it is finally possible to validate the simulation results by comparison of measured and calculated power values. The correlation of stressing conditions and breakage rates of alumina powder demonstrates the effect of stressing on breakage kinetics and breakage mechanism. It allows calculating the active mass in dependence on process parameters by an extension of Sch\u00f6nert\u2019s active mass model.Altogether, the presented stressing model features analytical functions for the mill-related stressing conditions and highlights the importance of stressing intensity as process determining parameter, which defines the required number of material-related stressing events and the specific energy.",

Experiments were performed comprising equal density (2230\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123) spherical glass beads particles of diameter 3, 5 and 8\u00a0mm and water as fluidising medium with different particle mass ratios varying from 0.17 to 6.0. In the expanded bed, both segregated and intermixed zones were observed depending on the different particle diameter combinations. In a completely segregated SLFB, the bottom monosized layer exhibited a negative deviation \u223c23% whereas a positive deviation \u223c25% was found in the top monosized layer when compared with the corresponding pure monosized system. A small mixing zone spanning approximately two particle diameters thick was observed to exist even in a completely segregated SLFB for higher diameter ratio cases. A slight decrease in the mixing zone height was noted with increasing liquid superficial velocity. For lower diameter ratio cases, a relatively lager mixing zone height was observed which increased with increasing liquid superficial velocity. The bed expansion ratio was noted to decrease with increasing solid mass ratio however it increased with increase in the fluidising velocity ratio following a reasonable power law trend. The expanded bed height of the binary mixture was not entirely additive of its corresponding mono-component bed heights and both positive and negative deviations were observed. Finally, a two-dimensional (2D) Eulerian-Eulerian (E-E) model incorporating the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) was used to quantify the binary system hydrodynamics. The model predicted expanded bed height agreed with experimental measurements within \u00b16% deviation. Presence of a mixing zone was also confirmed by the CFD model and simulated particle phase volume fraction distribution qualitatively agreed with the experimental visualisations.",

We used a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) to obtain the IR spectrum of the respirable coal dust, and the percentage of functional groups for each respirable coal dust was obtained by the peak area normalization method and then analyzed. And the wettability of respirable coal dust was evaluated by contact angle measurement. It is found that the benzene rings, aromatic hydrocarbons with benzene rings, aliphatic hydrocarbons with methyl, methylene, and so on, which have carbon-containing macromolecular structures, are hydrophobic. While the oxygen-containing functional groups represented by hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, and silicates and carbonate minerals are hydrophilic. Besides, the results show that respirable coal dust of different metamorphic grade coals has different wettability.

Governing equations were formulated by using Boussinesq approximation and non-Boussinesq state (density inversion) and were solved on a non-uniform mesh in eccentric cylinders by using the finite volume method. The numerical calculation was carried out for Rayleigh number ( 10 4 \u2a7d Ra \u2a7d 5 \u00d7 10 5 ), volume fraction of nanoparticles ( 0 \u2a7d \u03a6 \u2a7d 0.08 ) and different arrangements of heat sources with different angles in Pr\u00a0=\u00a013.31 and constant eccentricity (ev\u00a0=\u00a00.7). The results were compared with concentric cylinders and presented from streamlines and isotherms flow field, local and average Nusselt number, local and total entropy generation. The results showed that eccentricity, different arrangements, discrete constant temperature sources and non-Boussinesq state affected the best state of heat transfer. In addition, increasing Rayleigh number and volume fractions of nanoparticles caused an increase in the rate of heat transfer and total entropy generation. It was concluded that Boussinesq approximation and eccentric cylinders had higher rate of heat transfer and entropy generation than non-Boussinesq state and concentric cylinders, respectively.

Firstly, the optimization of the well-known oxidation route reported in literature (Improved Hummers Method) to obtain graphite oxide was carried out. Subsequently, different sets of reduced graphene oxide powders were synthesized through three different reduction routes: chemical, thermal and multiphase methods in order to obtain the most effective reduction strategy. Samples were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, SEM, FTIR, elemental analysis, X-ray Diffraction and TGA. It was demonstrated that multiphase reduction method, e.g. combination of more than one reduction route, specifically, thermal and chemical ones, allowed to enhance the effectiveness for the removal of the oxygen functional groups. A mild thermal treatment followed by a chemical reduction of graphene oxide using ascorbic acid as reducing agent, showed that the 47% of oxygen functional groups was reduced. This manuscript demonstrates that the amount of oxygen functional groups in the reduced graphene oxide structure is highly dependent on the reduction strategy. These amount of oxygen functional groups could directly affect the use of reduced graphene oxide in the different potential applications proposed in bibliography.",

Experiments and field application of the dry-type filtration dust collection device were carried out. Experimental results showed that the total dust suppression efficiency reached 98.41% and the leakage rate was 7.86% with the dry-type filtration dust collector. The field application in the Chaoyang tunnel indicated that the efficiency of the dry-type dust collector in suppressing total and respirable dust was 98.13% and 97.86%, respectively.

It therefore implies that maximum efficiency is only attainable at the expense of low capacity, and vice versa. This problem is caused by transience in granular flow due to start-ups and fluctuating feed-rates, in addition to fluctuations in feed material properties. If these variations are not checked, they cause instabilities, resulting in chaotic saddles responsible for in-process systemic error generation. These errors produce intermittent disruptions in production process and control.

Nanostructured Al-2Cu powder containing 4, 6 and 10\u202fwt.% B4C reinforcement particles synthesized using a high-energy attritor under argon atmosphere. Results showed that with increasing the content of B4C particles the matrix grain size decreased. Since the compressibility of mechanically milled powders is very low, hot press processing used for consolidation of nanostructured Al-2Cu/B4C powders. The hot pressed Al-2Cu/10\u202fwt.%B4C nanocomposite, when tested in compression, exhibited extremely high strength (1.1\u202fGPa) which is 735\u202fMPa higher than that of coarse grain Al-2Cu sample. Moreover, the hardening capacity (Hc) of hot pressed nanocomposites decreased with the increase in the content of B4C particles. According to Orowan strengthening mechanism, since B4C particles act as a barrier to the dislocations movement, the increase of B4C particles leads to the increase of barriers and as a result, \u0394\u03c3Orowan increases. Therefore, the strength of composite increases but work hardening capacity (Hc) decreases. The results of wear test indicated that wear rate and friction coefficient declined gradually as the B4C particles fraction increased. Based on this result, hot-pressed sample containing 10\u202fwt.% B4C showed the lowest wear rate and friction coefficient (1.9\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22125 mm3/m and 0.48 respectively).",

Although, the reducibility of cobalt oxides is greatly decreased due to interaction with aluminium species, this strong interaction may prevent the aggregation of Co particles under the harsh reduction conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the reduced spinel nanoparticles at 1123\u202fK revealed that the Co/Al atomic ratio has decreased to Co/Al\u202f=\u202f0.11, which may indicate a redistribution of the aluminum and cobalt species at the surface of the sample submitted to the reduction in a flow of hydrogen at 1123\u202fK.

When spray pressure exceeded 0.4\u00a0MPa, the microcapsule surface was wrinkled due to high evaporation rate of the atomized droplets. The spray pressure less than 0.3\u00a0MPa created larger atomized droplets and yielded the adhesive microcapsules with lower encapsulation efficiency.

This paper discusses the use of a novel air curtain generator and proposes a novel dust control and prevention technique. Based on the k-\u03b5 two-equation turbulence model, Hertz-Mindlin model and the CFD-DEM coupled interface compiled with C++ language, this paper firstly constructs a simulation model of the coupling between airflows and dust in a fully-mechanized excavation face, and then simulates the airflow fields and dust fields under forced/exhaust ventilation conditions with and without a novel air curtain generator being utilized. The results show that when only the forced/exhaust ventilation was used, a high concentration of dust spread throughout the entire tunnel space and no effective air curtain was formed. Furthermore, after the air curtain generator was turned on, as the radial-to-axial forced air ratio (PFQ) increased, the horizontal vortex in the front of the head-on section weakened gradually, and the originally disordered airflows behind the heading machine moved uniformly towards the head-on section. As the PFQ further increased, the distance (d) between the formed air curtain and head-on section decreased overall; through a curve fitting, this relationship can be written as: d\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.247\u00a0ln(PFQ)\u00a0+\u00a013.569. When the PFQ\u00a0>\u00a05:5, the average negative-pressure-induced dust-exhaust capacity increased, the distance between the formed air curtain and the head-on section decreased, and the re-entrainment of dust did not take place in a straightforward manner. Finally, some field measurements were carried out in order to validate the simulated results, with the subsequent comparison showing that the numerical simulated results were basically accurate.",

A commercial doser was used to supply nanoparticles continuously and precisely. A novel device (called a pressure equilibrium unit) was designed to connect the doser and the vacuum generator to make sure both parts avoid suffering from pressure shock. This system is denoted as\u00a0a continuous vacuum generator disperser (CVGD). The dosing rate of the CVGD for different particle materials tends to a constant value. All the aerosolized engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) of varying materials and primary diameter obtained through the CVGD distribute identically log-normally as\u00a0a whole. It is more difficult to separate the nanoparticles of smaller primary diameter using the CVGD, due to the stronger van der Waals attractive force between them. The total particle concentration can be adjusted easily by changing the motor speed of the doser (Dr), which was directly proportional to the dosing rate. As Dr increased, the PSDs shifted to a larger diameter to some extent. For sufficient large dosing rates, the CVGD performance could be improved significantly by increasing the inlet pressure of the vacuum generator (Pj).",

     "abstract": "Liquid templating is a well-established method for the fabrication of monodisperse microparticles. Nearly all liquid templating methods use totally immiscible liquids for the generation of monodisperse liquid droplets. With this approach, it is difficult to mass produce monodisperse droplets in the submicron range. The approach also suffers from some common difficulties associated with the use of small openings or channels required for the generation of small sized droplets including high back pressures and frequent blockage of the flow channels. Aimed at overcoming these difficulties, this paper presents a new co-flowing method that uses partially miscible liquids for the generation of a monodisperse liquid template. The results show that addition of a co-solvent in the inner phase that makes the liquid systems partially miscible changes the bulk and interfacial properties of the liquids that facilitate the generation of smaller droplets. They also confirm that the co-solvent concentration in the inner phase can be used as\u00a0an additional tool to manipulate the mean size of the resultant droplets and solid particles.",

Results show that the ignition delay of the particle and the flame inclined angle are in good agreement with that of the experiment. While examining the combustion of the gas phase by considering the variation of Flame Index (FI), it is found that a premixed and diffusion regions are formed around the particle after the devolatilization starts. The gas phase ignites at the boundary of the premixed and diffusion regions and the flame propagates towards the particle. This causes a rapid increasing of the temperature and the volatile velocity on the particle surface. Finally, a diffusion flame is formed and reaches a stable state around the particle.

     "abstract": "Catalyst regeneration process has recently been the subject of comprehensive research investigations focusing mainly on the chemistry of the regeneration while overlooking the bed hydrodynamics and its effects on the regeneration performance. For this purpose, an industrial Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) regenerator is simulated using a Multi-Phase Particle-In-Cell (MP-PIC) approach. The simulation is performed using a three-dimensional regenerator design with complex internals in order to study bed hydrodynamics, thermal effects, and chemical kinetics. The numerical model is then used to study typical industrial issues linked to the operation of industrial regenerators such as erosion areas, standpipe drainage, and CO emission levels. It is noticed that total outlet gas flow exceeds total inlet flow due to the formation of coke combustion products, an undersized standpipe, and inefficient placement of the air distributor rings. Highest erosion occurs in the feed line and plate. A low-temperature column exists in the center of the unit, and the highest temperatures are outside of the diplegs in the periphery of the freeboard. Elevated CO levels are present in the outlet gas because of poorly designed air distributor rings and lower than optimal temperatures in the unit. These simulation results show the numerous modeling capabilities of the MP-PIC approach to identify possible performance and reliability issues of an industrial process. Some redesign proposals have been made to enhance the FCC regenerator operations.",

The MoS2 bulk is easily exfoliated and functionalized by prefreezing and thermal shock of MoS2 powder in the ethanol solvent. Atomic force microscopy confirms that the approach can exfoliate MoS2 powder to nanosheets. UV\u2013visible spectroscopy of the prepared samples shows that fingerprint excitonic peaks appear in the spectrums and they become sharper by repeating the process. Optical band gap from Tauc plot of UV\u2013visible spectrum shows an increase in the band gap of exfoliated MoS2 up to 1.85\u00a0eV and the surface energy of the exfoliated MoS2 is measured as 29.8\u00a0mJ/m2. Annealing the prepared samples at temperatures up to 400\u00a0\u00b0C decreases the contact angle of water droplet from 130\u00b0 down to 2\u00b0. X-ray diffraction patterns and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirm that exfoliated MoS2 is functionalized during the exfoliation process and molybdite is formed on the surface by crumpling and agglomerating nanosheets due to heating, which is mainly responsible for increasing the surface energy as well as superhydrophilicity of the samples at 400\u00a0\u00b0C.",

The study presented in this paper aims to develop a program to investigate the moisture migration within coal cargoes in order to assess and eliminate shipping risks. The moisture migration phenomenon is initially modelled by adopting the classic infiltration theory, and considering the ship motions experienced by bulk carriers. An experimental method is developed to empirically characterise the moisture migration of a coal sample under simulated shipping dynamics. A predictive model is also developed to estimate the total moisture migration in a full size cargo by properly scaling up the experimental results.

     "abstract": "Expanded flow bins are commonly used in the material handling industry to store and load train wagons. These bins are known in the industry as Train Load Out (TLO) bins. Several iron ore TLO bins have been designed and constructed to accommodate this demand. It has been reported that some iron ore TLO bins suffer a dynamic condition during discharge known as silo quaking. The quake causes several problems, which could lead to structural connections failure, reduced fatigue life of structural connections, computer data corruption, on-site personnel discomfort, loss of production, and increase in maintenance costs. However, the author had structurally designed a 2500 tonne iron ore TLO and prevented silo quaking by providing sufficient stiffness, damping and mass to counterbalance the pulsating loads and mass losses produced by the flowing iron ore. In this paper, a numerical model incorporating time-varying mass will be presented to explain the dynamics of Iron Ore TLO Bin. The model is validated by experimental results obtained from a 1 in 10 scaled model. The proposed numerical model supports the theory that pulsation loads occur in almost all bins and whether the induced dynamic loads cause any quaking problems are dependent on the severity of the loads, natural frequencies of the bin and its supporting structure.",

The effect of annealing and doping on their structural and optical properties of CuO are examined using XRD, FTIR and DRS. The surface and lattice defects in CuO and Tb doped CuO is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using positron lifetime and Doppler broadening spectroscopy. The average positron lifetime and electron momentum (energy) S parameter increases owing to the number of vacancies in the CuO lattice upon doping and decreases with increasing temperature. The migration of vacancies from grain to grain boundary region is observed at 600\u00a0\u00b0C annealed samples. At 800 \u00b0C, the overall behavior of lifetime value denotes that the vacancy type defect is recovered, cluster vacancy and microvoids exists with reducing size.

The influence of annealing temperature and dopant ion on the efficiency is also elaborated. Enhanced photocatalytic efficiency in Tb doped CuO is observed upon annealing.

Nevertheless, the situation can be improved if the components are loaded as a sequence of several sandwiches, each of these sandwiches containing layers of components that are proportional to their share in the mixture. In this case, a sort of pre-mixing occurs while still at the loading stage \u2013 which allows reducing the optimum mixing time and increasing the homogeneity of the mixture. The theory of Markov chains was used to simulate the mixing kinetics. It is shown that the number of loaded sandwiches has a very strong influence on the process efficiency. A loading device that can effectively realize multi-layer loading is proposed. The mixing kinetics for ternary mixture of glass beads was investigated experimentally at a lab scale vibration mixer. A one-time loading and a two-sandwich loading were compared. It was shown that the optimum mixing time and non-homogeneity of the mixture were reduced by half in the latter case.",

The obtained results show that using a nanofluid instead of water leads to the increased thermal efficiency and reduction in heat at wall of the heat pipe. Also, the temperature difference between the evaporator and the condenser is a function of input power; this means that by an increase in the input capacity, the temperature difference between the evaporator and the condenser increases. It was observed that the use of nanofluid reduces the axial-flow pressure of the fluid inside the wick. As a result, the transmission of fluid flow inside the wick from the condenser to the evaporator is easily done with the cost of using a nanofluid.

Simple and scooped drum granulators are utilized to attain homogenous seeded granules in which the effects of drum rotational speed, particles surface energy, and particles size ratio are investigated. To reduce the simulation time a scale-up scheme is designed in which a dimensionless number (Cohesion number) is defined based on the work of cohesion and gravitational potential energy of the particles. Also a mathematical/numerical method along with a MATLAB code is developed by which the percentage of surface coverage of each granule is predicted precisely. The results show that use of continuous granulator for seeded granulation is promising provided that a high level of shear is considered in the granulator design, i.e. using baffles inside drum granulators is essential for producing seeded granules. It is observed that the optimum surface energy for seeded granulation in scooped granulator (used in this study) with rotational speed of 50 rpm is 3\u00a0J/m2, which is close to the value predicted by the concept of Cohesion number.

     "abstract": "The applicability of the hydrodynamic similarity criteria (scaling law) introduced by Glicksman (1988) was investigated using fully coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) simulations for single-spout fluidized beds. Four test cases were performed to investigate the scaling law in a pseudo-2D spouted-fluidized bed. In addition, the applicability of Glicksman\u2019s scaling law for simulating 3D fluidized beds was studied. In all simulations, characteristic dimensionless groups, i.e. the Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr), particle-to-fluid density, bed initial height to particle diameter and bed width to particle diameter were kept constant for the both base and scaled cases. Comparing the time averaged particle velocities, gas velocities and volume fractions between the base and scaled cases indicated a very good overall hydrodynamic similarity for all test cases. A minor discrepancy observed between the simulation results of the base and scaled cases was explained by a force analysis.An advantage of the scaling approach, i.e., reducing computational time, was also presented in the last four test cases, including a large-scale simulation, showing that this approach can be considered as a promising way to simulate large-scale spouted-fluidized beds.",

     "abstract": "Fumed silica is an important industrial material, which is widely used in medical, cosmetic, and electronic products. One important industrial application of the fumed silica powder is using it as fillers, which are key materials for reinforcing the high-performance/high-functional industrial products. However, the use of fumed silica as filler is limited to micrometer or millimeter sized particles, because nanometer sized silica particles tend to aggregate. In this study, the surface of fine silica powder is modified with n- and t-butyl alcohols, which exhibit different steric hindrance effects. The surface wettability of each modified silica powders is determined in two ways: macroscopic and microscopic wettability. Macroscopic wettability refers to preference dispersion test and microscopic wettability refers to evaluation of the molecular level by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The modification ratio of each sample is confirmed by thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), and the hydrophobicity of these modified silica powders is evaluated by the preference dispersion test. Molecular level evaluation of surface wettability by FT-IR confirms an obvious structural difference due to the steric hindrance of the n- and t-butoxy groups on the surface of silica. In addition, a correlation between macroscopic and microscopic evaluation results for the surface wettability of modified silica powders is confirmed.",

The reduction of powder materials is commonly observed in blast furnace production but has been rarely investigated. In this study, thermal kinetics analysis was conducted to describe the powder reduction of dicalcium ferrite (2CaO\u22c5Fe2O3, C2F), calcium ferrite (CaO\u22c5Fe2O3, CF), and hematite (Fe2O3, H), with particle sizes below 70\u00a0\u00b5m. Isothermal reduction experiments were performed through thermogravimetry analysis under CO atmosphere. The reduction degrees and reaction rate constants increased in the order of C2F, CF, and H at 1123, 1173, and 1223\u00a0K. The reduction rate analysis illustrated that the reduction of C2F, CF, and H appeared as one-, two-, and three-stage reactions, respectively. Moreover, the reduction of C2F and CF proceeded as the 2D reaction mechanism described by Avrami\u2013Erofeev (A-E) equation. The reduction of H was initially controlled by 2D, followed by the 3D A-E kinetics equation. Phase with superior reducibility could be reduced by CO in more dimensions of sample layers. The reduction degrees and rate change expressed by A-E equations were verified to be in accordance with the experimental data. A new kinetics model was proposed to elucidate the reduction of C2F, CF, and H in ultrafine powder compared with that in pellets. The reduction process in the powdered samples comprised independent reduction stages caused by uniform CO diffusion in powdered particles.",

Results showed that the degree of solid-liquid homogeneity increased with an increase in impeller speed. A long flexible connection piece was conductive to solid particles suspension process. The solid particles could not obtain enough momentum to suspend to the upper region of stirred tank with small impeller spacing. Larger particle size resulted in less homogenous distribution of solid particles. The optimum aperture ratio and aperture diameter of punched rigid-flexible impeller were 12% and 8\u00a0mm, respectively, for solid particles suspension process. It was found that punched rigid-flexible impeller was more efficient in suspending solid particles compared with rigid impeller and rigid-flexible impeller at the same power consumption.

The so-obtained e-HNb3O8 showed a larger specific surface area, a higher density of total acid sites and an improved catalytic performance in the dehydration of 2-heptanol and formic acid, compared to the corresponding sample prepared by the conventional solid-state mixing. The ball-milled K2CO3\u2013Nb2O5 mixtures, layered KNb3O8, ion-exchanged HNb3O8 and exfoliated HNb3O8 samples were characterized by PXRD, TEM-EDS, TGA-MS and SEM-EDS. The characterization results revealed more intercalated K+ ions in KNb3O8 particles as well as more homogeneous K2CO3\u2013Nb2O5 mixture when the employed preparation technique was used. This is achieved by more infiltration of K2CO3 into Nb2O5 lattice before ball milling, thereby resulting in the above positive findings. Therefore, our approach has great potential to be extended to other niobate-containing nanosheet-type materials.",

To estimate the mechanism of improvement, we investigated the effects of the main particle diameter on the improvement of compressed packing fractions experimentally.The main particles were 397 and 1460\u00a0nm in diameter and the admixed particles were 8, 21, 62, and 104\u00a0nm in diameter. The main and admixed particles were mixed in various mass ratios, and the compressed packing fractions of the mixtures were measured. SEM images were used to analyze the coverage diameter and the surface coverage ratio of the admixed particles on the main particles. The main particle packing fraction was improved as the diameter ratio (=main particles/admixed particles) increased. This was explained by a linked rigid-3-bodies model with leverage. Furthermore, the actual surface coverage ratio at which the most improved packing fraction was obtained decreased with increasing main particle diameter. This was explained by the difference in the curvature of the main particle surface.",

For a vibration amplitude of 10\u00a0\u03bcm, particles around the cylindrical rod were consolidated to a certain extent due to gravity; however, for a vibration amplitude of 70\u00a0\u03bcm or more, a pair of convection rolls formed on both sides of the vibrating rod. The strength of the convection was quantified from the particle velocity distribution in the convection rolls, and the relationship between the convection strength and vibration amplitude was elucidated. In addition, the air-pressure distribution in the powder bed was measured showing that the convection strength correlates with the characteristic positive pressure, i.e., the average value of positive pressure measurements.

Several TEM techniques were used and HT-XRD experiments performed to determine the crystal structure and the morphological microstructure of the samples obtained during different heat treatments. The heat treatments were: quenching from 850\u00a0\u00b0C to room temperature and two consecutive calorimetric runs at 5\u00a0\u00b0C/min. After the quenching,\u03b12 is the major phase observed, reaching 95\u00a0mass%. The remaining 5\u00a0mass% consisted of martensitic phases: one sample had \u03b3\u2032, a hexagonal structure, and the other \u03b21\u2032, a rhombohedral structure. During the first calorimetric run, the sample containing the \u03b3\u2032 phase exhibited a calorimetric event and the sample containing the \u03b21\u2032 phase did not. The calorimetric event is attributed to the austenitic transformation \u03b3\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03b21. The lack of calorimetric event in the sample containing the \u03b21\u2032 is associated with the inhibition of the transformation \u03b21\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03b21 because of the precipitation of the \u03b32 phase. Finally, the absence of a calorimetric event in the second run with the first sample is associated with the retransformation to \u03b21\u2032 instead to \u03b3\u2032 phase during cooling of the first calorimetric run.

It is highly desirable to develop a simple method for assessing the triboelectric charging tendency of powders using a very small quantity. We explore the use of aerodynamic dispersion by a pulse of pressurised air using the disperser of Morphologi G3\u00a0as\u00a0a novel application. In this device particles are dispersed by injection of a pulse of pressurised air, the dispersed particles are then analysed for size and shape analysis. The high transient air velocity inside the disperser causes collisions of sample particles with the walls, resulting in dispersion, but at the same time it could cause triboelectric charging of the particles. In this study, we analyse this process by evaluating the influence of the transient turbulent pulsed-air flow on particle impact on the walls and the resulting charge transfer. Computational Fluid Dynamics is used to calculate particle trajectory and impact velocity as\u00a0a function of the inlet air pressure and particle size. Particle tracking is done using the Lagrangian approach and transient conditions. The charge transfer to particles is predicted as\u00a0a function of impact velocity and number of collisions based on a charge transfer model established previously for several model particle materials. Particles experience around ten collisions at different velocities as they are dispersed and thereby acquire charges, the value of which approaches the equilibrium charge level. The number of collisions is found to be rather insensitive to particle size and pressure pulse, except for fine particles, smaller than about 30\u00a0\u00b5m. As the particle size is increased, the impact velocity decreases, but the average charge transfer per particle increases, both very rapidly. Aerodynamic dispersion by a gas pressure pulse provides an easy and quick assessment of triboelectric charging tendency of powders.",

The velocity and temperature profiles at a cross section have been found to be flatter in dispersion model compared to those obtained from the homogeneous model.

This technique stands out because of its low cost and high efficiency; however, the difficulty of controlling the size and morphology of the product is its principal disadvantage. The aim of this study was to synthesize calcium phosphates through microwave-induced and salt-assisted solution combustion synthesis.

The morphology and the electrical properties of CaP in relation to the amount of salt added were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and impedance spectroscopy, respectively. It was found that the inclusion of salt during the synthesis affects the morphology of calcium phosphates, creating whisker-like structures, with lengths approximately between 500\u00a0nm and 1\u00a0\u00b5m and widths between 30\u00a0nm and 300\u00a0nm, which depend on the salt concentration.

The working surfaces were grounded and roughness ranged from 0.140 to 8.600\u00a0\u03bcm. It was found that uneven surfaces tended to give rise to voids between two solids, where air stored in the voids was able to accelerate discharging. With the same roughness, PVC tended to generate more electrostatic charge than PP by one order of magnitude. For both materials, electrostatic charge generation first increased with surface roughness and then decreased. The maximum electrostatic charge generated was found to occur when the effects of interaction, contact area and voids discharging were at equilibrium.

     "abstract": "Fe particles were coated with ZrO2 nanopowders using mechanical milling method combined with high temperature recovery annealing process. The effect of milling time on particle size, phase structure and magnetic properties of the core-shell structure powders was studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that the surfaces of the composite powders comprised thin and uniform layers of ZrO2 insulating powders after milling. Also, the SEM images showed the morphology of micro-cellular structured compacts with cell-body of Fe particles and indicated that Fe particles were well separated and insulated by thin ZrO2 layers. The Fe/ZrO2 soft magnetic composites displayed much higher electrical resistivity, lower core loss than that of the pure Fe powder cores without ZrO2 layers at medium and high frequencies. The preparation method of ZrO2-insulated Fe powders provides a promising method to reduce the core loss and improve the magnetic properties for soft magnetic composite materials.",

     "abstract": "Electric-arc furnace dust (EAFD) is an industrial waste produced by the volatilization of metals during scrap melting in electric arc furnaces. This waste is classified as Class I \u2013 hazardous, because lead and cadmium concentrations are above the limits set in the leaching test. Processes are carried out in many countries to recover the metals contained in EAFD. In Brazil, these processes are usually not conducted in the industry because the low percentage of commercially valuable metals makes it economically unfeasible to recover them. One of the study alternatives is the use of EAFD in civil construction. Studies have shown that EAFD increases the mechanical strength of mortars and Portland cement-based concretes. However, EAFD delayed cement setting time, which can jeopardize its use in construction. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of EAFD when added to fly ash (FA) and rice husk ash (RHA) based geopolymers. Geopolymer mortars were prepared at a ratio of 1:3 (FA\u00a0+\u00a0RHA: sand, four different granulations) and added with 0, 10, 15, and 20% EAFD in relation to the mass of FA\u00a0+\u00a0RHA. Compressive mechanical strength and leaching tests were carried out at the ages of 7, 28, and 91\u00a0days. Microstructural analyses were performed using XRD, FTIR, and SEM/EDS. EAFD did not negatively influence the geopolymerization process. The highest compressive strength results for the mortars containing the waste were found for 20% of EAFD. All mortars, regardless of EAFD content, were classified as non- hazardous Class II at the age of 91\u00a0days.",

The introduced numerical model (HCTBALL) defines plane and cylindrical walls for the boundary conditions to be applied. In addition, the article presents an efficient method to apply the torque. The displacements of the inner and outer walls are interdependent while torsion was applied to control the intermediate principal stress parameter (b). To verify the model, the paper employs results from experimental HCTs on Firoozkooh sand under both monotonic loading and drained conditions. A comparison of the presented model and the experimental results shows that both are closely concordant.It was shown that the deviatoric stress decreases as the principal stress angle (\u03b1) increases. In addition, it was observed that by increasing the confining pressure, the internal friction angle (\u03c6\u2032) decreases; however, at higher confining pressures, this reduction is insignificant.

Some suitable similarity transformations reduced the governing boundary layer non-linear partial differential equations into a set of ordinary non-linear differential equations. The transformed equations are then solved numerically using fourth order Runga-Kutta method along with Shooting technique. The major outcomes of the present study is that the magnetic field impedes the fluid motion while thermal as well as mass buoyancy forces accelerate it, the thermophoretic diffusion enhances dimensionless fluid temperature as well as concentration leading to thicker thermal and concentration boundary layers. On the other hand, concentration exponent, Brownian motion parameter and chemical reaction parameter exhibit reverse trend on temperature and concentration.

We developed a four-layered working electrode, in which the size of particles increased from the bottom layer of TiO2 (P-25) through three successive layers of Zr-doped TiO2, which were calcined at 450, 600, and 850\u00a0\u00b0C respectively. The enhancement in open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) can be attributed to the electronic- and micro-structures in the working electrode. The former is related to band bending, whereas the latter is related to light-scattering within multiple layers. Simulation results (FactSage) demonstrate that Zr doping in TiO2 can suspend or delay the formation of oxygen vacancies and thereby reduce the number of electron scattering centers, which helps to suspend electron-hole recombination by strengthening Ti-O bonds. The proposed four-layered working electrode produced an 80.2% increase in \u03b7, compared with DSSCs using a TiO2 (P-25) electrode. This study demonstrated a novel metal doping strategy for the manipulation of electronic structure and photoelectron conversion efficiency. The proposed methodology could also be used to guide the design of photo-catalysts in general.",

The shear behavior of monosized and binary systems with the same initial void ratio differs significantly, suggesting that the state of compaction of the system is more influential than the initial void ratio. Comparison between compacted and uncompacted samples confirms that compaction increases the shear strength of granular matter. At the particle scale, the coordination number decreases with the augmentation of the volume fraction of coarse particles.

Microhardness and wear tests of the produced samples were carried out. Wear experiments of these composites were performed with specially manufactured test equipment at different application loads (5\u00a0N, 10\u00a0N and 15\u00a0N), different sliding distances (250\u00a0m, 500\u00a0m, 750\u00a0m and 1000\u00a0m) and a constant speed of 0.46\u00a0m/s. In addition, optical microscope, SEM, EDS analyses were used to determine the microstructural changes in the worn and unworn surface of the manufactured composite materials. The results of experimental studies show that the increasing the B4C reinforced rate in composites with Al matrix has led to increase of the hardness and to reduce of the wear loss.",

The resulting particle concentration evolutions were in qualitative agreement with those from the mixing model. It was seen that the algorithm was most stable in the case of the binary colour experiments.

Two types of important porous media, glass ball and aluminum metal foam, are considered for the porous matrix. The experimental data show dramatic enhancement in the thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity of the synthesized hybrid nanofluids, and hence, these thermophysical properties could not be modeled using available models of nanofluids. Thus, the actual available experimental data for the thermal conductivity and the dynamic viscosity of hybrid nanofluids are directly utilized in the present theoretical study. Various comparison with results published previously in the literature are performed and the results are found to be in excellent agreement. In most cases, the average Nusselt number Nul is decreasing function of the volume fraction of nanoparticles. The results show the reduction of heat transfer using nanoparticles in porous media. The observed reduction of the heat transfer rate is much higher for hybrid nanofluid compared to the single nanofluid.",

The results reveal that when the fluid drag force is less than the liquid bridge force between particles, liquid distribute all over the bed. Bubble size increases as the increase of inter-particle force, then decreases owing to the increase of particle weight with increasing liquid flow rate. When the fluid drag force is greater than the liquid bridge force, liquid mainly distribute in the upper part of the bed. And it is difficult for the wet particles to form agglomerates. Bubble size decreases with increasing liquid flow rate due to the increasing of minimum fluidization velocity. Besides, the acoustic emission (AE) measurements illustrate that the liquid adhesion and evaporation on particles could enhance the particles motion intensity. Consequently, the bubble and particle behaviors change due to the variation in fluidized gas velocity and liquid flow rate should be seriously considered when attempting to successfully design and operate the side wall liquid spray gas solid fluidized bed.",

Geopolymeric reaction occurs as a result of the activation of fly ash with alkali solutions. In Thailand, a large amount of high-calcium fly ash is available due to the use of low-grade lignite coal feedstock for pulverized coal combustion process and the calcium content becomes very high. In this study, heat curing at 35\u00a0\u00b0C as a representative of a high ambient temperature (hot weather) and low cost was investigated. Curing at temperature of 65\u00a0\u00b0C and room temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C were also conducted to compare the results. Geopolymeric products were tested for compressive strength and characterized by XRD, IR, SEM and TGA techniques. The results showed that heat curing enhanced the geopolymerization resulting in the formation of Si O Al network product. Heat curings at 35\u00a0\u00b0C and 65\u00a0\u00b0C led to the formation of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and alumino-silicate (geopolymer bonding). Without heat curing, the product was predominantly C-S-H compound and the matrix was as strong as the heat-cured product. The immersion of samples in 3% sulfuric acid solution revealed that the performance of the heat-cured samples were better than those cured at room temperature. In addition, application of research results was to produce the geopolymer brick with outdoor heat exposure of 35\u00a0\u00b0C. Pedestrian pathway was demonstrated.",

Detailed investigations focused on the influence of TiBw volume fraction on microstructure and its correlations with mechanical properties mainly at high temperatures ranging from 500\u00a0\u00b0C to 700\u00a0\u00b0C. Highly aligned TiB whiskers along extrusion direction caused the formation of TiBw columnar reinforced structure, which was composed of ductile TiBw-poor interior regions and hardened TiBw-rich boundaries. Refined prior \u03b2 phases arising from dynamic recrystallization led to the size reduction in \u03b1 colonies. This tendency commonly accompanied with the formation of equiaxed \u03b1 phase was evidently enhanced by the restriction of increasing TiB whiskers at the boundaries. Much better strengthening of TiB whiskers was achieved on the premise of good interfacial bonding with Ti matrix at high temperatures, and the strengthening depended linearly on their volume fractions, with strength increments of about 44.3\u00a0MPa/vol.% at 500\u00a0\u00b0C, and 27.5\u00a0MPa/vol.% at 600\u00a0\u00b0C, yet merely 6.3\u00a0MPa/vol.% at 700\u00a0\u00b0C.

This paper reports the findings of a study on the dispersion of hydrophilic fumed silica nanoparticle clusters, Aerosil 200\u00a0V, in water using two batch rotor-stators: MICCRA D-9 and VMI. The MICCRA D-9 head consists of a set of teeth for the stator and another for the rotor, whereas the VMI has a stator with slots and a rotor which consists of a 4-bladed impeller attached to an outer set of teeth. The dispersion process, studied at different power input values and over a range of concentrations (1, 5, 10\u00a0wt.%), was monitored through the evolution of PSD. Erosion was found to be the dominant breakage mechanism irrespective of operating conditions or rotor-stator type. The smallest attainable size was also found to be independent of the power input or the design of the rotor-stator. Break up kinetics increased upon the increase of power input, and this also depended on the rotor-stator design. With MICCRA D-9 which has smaller openings on both the stator and rotor, the break up rate was faster. Increasing the particle concentration decreased break up kinetics. It could also be shown that operating at high concentrations can still be beneficial as the break up rate is higher when assessed on the basis of specific power input per mass of solids.",

The nanofluid is used in tube side and hot water flows in annulus side. Silver nanoparticles synthesized through plant extract method from green tea leaves are utilized. Particle migration causes non-uniform concentration distribution, and non-uniformity intensifies by increase in Reynolds number and concentration. The results indicate that at high concentrations and Reynolds numbers, particle migration can have a great effect on entropy generation rates. For water inlet temperature of 308\u00a0K, the contribution of friction in nanofluid entropy generation is much more than that of heat transfer. However, as the water inlet temperature increases to 360\u00a0K, the heat transfer contribution increases such that at low Reynolds numbers, the thermal contribution exceeds the frictional one. For total heat exchanger, Bejan number is smaller than 0.2 at water inlet temperature of 308\u00a0K, while Bejan number has a large value at water inlet temperature of 360\u00a0K.

     "abstract": "Guidelines for the calculation of bulk solid material cross sectional dimensions and the influence of the belt conveyor transition length on the inclination of the trajectory at discharge are well established. However, not a great deal of research has been conducted on the influence of bulk solid material properties and conveyor belt transition geometry on the bulk solid material cross section at discharge. As such, assessment of cross section break-up associated with cohesive materials and transverse spreading of free flowing materials is missing. Conversely, the majority of discharge trajectory analysis techniques focus on analysis in a single vertical plane along the length of the belt.This paper presents an analysis of high speed conveyor discharge trajectories in three dimensions, taking into account transverse spreading of free flowing materials and shearing, or cross section discontinuity, exhibited by cohesive materials. Transverse bulk solid material behaviour and trajectory discharge is evaluated using a combination of experimental laboratory tests, a continuum mechanics approach incorporating CAD and Discrete Element Modelling (DEM). The work presented shows that bulk solid material behaviour at discharge is directly influenced by material characteristics and interactions resulting from the geometry of the belt conveyor transition zone.",

Structural models of the oxygen-containing functional groups in coal were established and used to analyze the reactions of these groups during spontaneous combustion. The Gibbs free energy and enthalpy changes associated with these reactions were determined using quantum mechanical analysis, and the results indicated that the dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions of the hydroxyl groups in coal were only mildly exothermic, whereas reactions involving the oxidation of the carbonyl groups were much more exothermic. In contrast, reactions resulting in the generation of carbon monoxide were endothermic. By comparing the heat release characteristics of the reactions of the oxygen-containing functional groups with the levels of oxygen consumption and gas production, as well as temperature profiles of the reactions, it was concluded that the decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups is critical to the production of heat during the initial stages of the spontaneous combustion of coal and that oxidation does not occur during this period. These results also explain why the temperature of coal rises slowly during the initial stages of its spontaneous combustion.",

As one example, basic copper carbonate was wet ground with elemental sulfur and appropriate additives such as ammonium sulfate to transform the surface chemical composition from oxide to sulfide. Physicochemical characterizations of the prepared samples were conducted by a set of analytical methods, including X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopic analysis, SEM morphology analysis, Zeta potential and the dissolved copper concentration measurement. The beneficiation efficiency of the modified copper carbonate by a conventional froth flotation used usually for sulfide minerals was examined as a quantitative evaluation to optimize the experimental conditions for the modification operation.

Observing the particle movements offers deep insights into changes in the mechanical behavior of the bulk (e.g., densification, loosening or formation of failure areas) and into the behavior of single particles. However, obtaining particle-level information on the dynamics of an entire shear-tester experiment remains a great challenge.

A fully functional micro shear-tester was developed and implemented into an X-ray microtomography device. With this combination we can visualize all particles within small bulk volumes of the order of a few \u03bcl under well-defined mechanical manipulation. The processing of time-resolved tomographic data makes it possible to localize and track particles despite large angle increments of up to 5\u00b0 between tomographic measurements.

These dimensions correspond well with measurements by both laser diffraction and optical microscopy methods for a Pickering-type water-in-n-dodecane emulsion prepared by dispersing dry water in n-dodecane. Optical microscopy confirmed that the dry water consisted of flocs of non-spherical water droplets, and the flocs ranged in size from a few tens of micrometers to a few millimeters in air. On the basis of these results, the flocs of water droplets were proposed to dissociate into individual water droplets under the air blast during droplet size measurement by the laser diffraction method. It was also confirmed that pressurizing the dry water between two glass slides led to encapsulated water leaking from the silica nanoparticle shells. This on-demand pressure-sensitive water leak phenomenon shows a possible usage of the dry waters as a material delivery carrier.",

The relationship between pH values, the dispersion stability, crystalline types and microstructure of alumina-coated rutile TiO2 samples were studied. It is indicated that the coating film exhibited amorphous hydrous alumina (at pH 3\u20137), boehmite (at pH 7\u20139) and bayerite (pH\u00a0>\u00a011), respectively. And the higher aging temperature was in favor of the elevation of boehmite content of coating film. As the boehmite content increased, the dispersion stability was gradually enhanced and the prepared sample exhibited optimum dispersion stability at pH 9 and aging temperature 200\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The increase of steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion led to the promotion of dispersion stability via coating hydrous alumina film on the surface of rutile TiO2. The detection of AlO and the significantly enhancement of AlOTi intensity confirmed that the film coating process should be main attributed to both chemical bonding and physical adsorption.",

It is found that the heat transfer rate is significantly enhanced by incrementing Rayleigh number and thermal conductivity ratio. It is also observed that at all Rayleigh numbers, the total Nusselt number rises and then reduces with increasing the nanoparticle volume fractions so that there is an optimal volume fraction of the nanoparticles where the heat transfer rate within the enclosure has a maximum value. Finally, the results reveal that by increasing the thermal conductivity of the nanoparticles and Rayleigh number, distribution of solid particles becomes uniform.",

     "abstract": "The productivity of fractured wells is mainly governed by propped fractures, so it is of significant importance to find out where the injected proppants go during hydraulic fracturing treatments, as this is essential to scheduling proppant injection in fracturing design. Using a coupled CFD-DEM model, the transport and placement of multi-sized proppants in fractures in vertical and horizontal wells were systematically investigated, and the effects of having multi-sized particles relative to uniformly-sized ones on the proppant placement were quantitatively characterized. When a proppant-laden fluid is injected into a fracture in vertical wells, a small proppant bank quickly forms. The injected large and small proppant particles are almost uniformly mixed, with just a small-proppant region at the back side of the bank. In comparison in horizontal wells, a proppant dune first forms near the wellbore in a fracture, and the large proppant particles are more likely to accumulate near the wellbore while the small particles are transported deeper into the fracture. The main transport mechanisms of proppant particles are settlement and fluidization, which cause a three-layer flow pattern (stationary proppant bed, fluidization layer and clean fluid layer) to form. In addition, vortex is also an important proppant transport mechanism, especially in a fracture in horizontal wells, where the vortex drags the injected proppant particles to different locations causing a dual-dune profile. The effect of fracture tip screen-out on the proppant placement was investigated. Screen-out can significantly change the flow field in a fracture and this will subsequently affect final proppant placement. Ultimately, the process of graded proppant injection was realistically modeled, which shows small proppants to be transported deeper into the fracture, while large proppants accumulate near the wellbore.",

The obtained non-linear ordinary differential equations are solved by Duan\u2013Rach Approach (DRA). This method allows us to find a solution without using numerical methods to evaluate the undetermined coefficients. This method modifies the standard Adomian Decomposition Method by evaluating the inverse operators at the boundary conditions directly. The impacts of various parameters such as the Reynolds number, the expansion ratio, the magnetic parameter, the power law index, the solid volume fraction and the radiation parameter are investigated on the velocity and temperature. Furthermore, the value of the Nusselt number is calculated and presented through figures. The results indicate that the temperature profile and the Nusselt number have a direct relationship with the solid volume fraction and have an inverse relationship with the radiation parameter. In addition, the limiting cases are gained and found to be in an excellent agreement with the previous works.",

     "abstract": "In this study, experiments and analyses have been carried out to investigate the influences of denitrification and flue gas Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS) on ash particles adhesion force. With use of a denitrification system, it is found that the ash particles adhesion force is strongly influenced by the mass ratio, R, of (NH4)HSO4 to ash. Three influencing zones are identified, i.e., little effect zone (R\u00a0<\u00a01:150), intermediate effect zone (1:150\u00a0<\u00a0R\u00a0<\u00a01:60), and huge effect zone (R\u00a0>\u00a01:60). It is necessary to operate in the little effect zone in order to avoid ash deposition in the air preheater. With use of a WHRS, it is found that the ash adhesion force is strongly affected by the flue gas temperature in comparison with the Engineering Acid Dew Temperature (EADT). With decreasing temperature below the EADT, both the collected ash amount and ash adhesion force rise, and the detected particles size increases, indicating particle accumulation that improves ash collection efficiency.",

Because of the strong swirling flow in cyclone, Reynolds stress transport model (RSTM) is used to calculate the Reynolds stresses. Numerical simulation is accomplished at a temperature range of 293\u2013700\u00a0K and four inlet velocities. Also, a comparison is conducted between two Stairmand high efficiency cyclones with the same dimensions, one with single inlet and the other with double inlets to declare the effect of the second inlet on cyclone performance. The analysis of results shows that the swirling flow becomes weaker for higher temperature cases and thus, flow pressure drop and particle separation efficiency is noticeably decreased. Increasing in temperature causes decrease in natural vortex length. Also, study of natural vortex length is performed for the studied range of temperature.",

     "abstract": "This paper mainly presents a numerical study of the gas flow in horizontal turbo air classifiers. The effect of the air-inlet direction on the performance of classifier was also investigated through powder classification experiments. The simulated results show that the vertical vortex is the dominant flow in conical part of the classifier and there exists the horizontal vortex in the classifying chamber. The tangential velocity profile resembles a Rankine vortex inside the rotor cage. The vertical vortex intensity increases with increasing the inlet air velocity, while the rotor cage speed has limited effect on the control of gas pathlines in the classifying chamber. Horizontal turbo air classifiers are divided into four quadrants according to the air-inlet direction. For classifiers in quadrants I and III, a double-layer flow with opposite directions generates around the rotor cage which causes a secondary vortex. The secondary vortex is eliminated and the airflow becomes uniform in the classifier that belongs to quadrant \u03a0 or IV. The experimental results with fluidized catalytic cracking catalysts and fly ash demonstrate that cut sizes of this classifier decrease averagely by 5\u00a0\u03bcm and 2.2\u00a0\u03bcm respectively, and the classification accuracy increases by 7.5\u201310.3%.",

The samples were characterized by powder XRD which confirmed them as \u03b1-Al2O3. The alumina samples heated at different temperatures exhibited qualitatively similar broad luminescence spectra which on deconvolution yielded different emissions with a systematic trend in intensity as the function of annealing temperature. The various emissions could be assigned to defect centers such as F, F2 and F22+ centers. The time resolved emission studies could delineate the lifetimes of various emissions.

The findings of this work are then compared with our experimental data on Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 (BSCF5582) membranes. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate constants of both membranes are two orders of magnitude greater than their respective oxygen desorption rate constants as the oxygen adsorption occurs in less than 24\u00a0s whilst the oxygen desorption takes approximately one hour to reach equilibrium. The activation energy for oxygen adsorption of LSCF5582 reduced to a quarter of its value with increasing the sintering temperature from 1200\u00a0\u00b0C to 1300\u00a0\u00b0C. This is attributed to the oxygen exchange occurring more rapidly along the grain boundaries resulting in a lower activation energy.

The process of adsorption was conducted for dye concentrations ranging from 10 to 50\u00a0mg/dm3. The physicochemical properties of the inorganic support and the resulting hybrid pigments were determined. The characterisation included determination of the dispersion and morphology of the systems (particle size distribution, SEM images), porous structure parameters (BET isotherms) and electrokinetic properties (zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility), as well as thermal stability and colorimetric parameters. The efficiency of food dye adsorption on TiO2-SiO2 was examined, and the degree of coverage of the inorganic support with the food dyes was also estimated based on elemental analysis results. The results were used to evaluate the quality of the functional hybrid pigments obtained using selected food dyes and TiO2-SiO2 support, and to determine how the adsorption efficiency is affected by the dye structure. Selected diazo food dyes were more effectively adsorbed on the surface of the synthetic TiO2-SiO2 support. The hybrid pigments obtained have desirable physicochemical and functional properties. The synthesised food dye/TiO2-SiO2 hybrids may be used in pharmaceutical products.",

Two model compounds, poorly aqueous soluble ibuprofen (IBU) and fenofibrate (FEN), were individually mixed with SBA-15 powder and heated above their respective melting points. Upon cooling, the physicochemical and solid-state properties of the solid dispersions were investigated by N2 adsorption, DSC, XRD, SEM and solid-state NMR. The molten API was found to be absorbed into the pores, confined within the nano-channels of SBA-15, and re-solidified to an amorphous solid dispersion. Due to the amorphous properties, the APIs showed a significant enhancement in dissolution rate as compared with the untreated crystalline APIs. Although the amorphous forms were not at thermodynamic equilibrium, the APIs exhibited excellent solid-state physical stability even under accelerated stress conditions. In comparison with APIs loaded using a co-spray drying process (previous work), the melt-absorption process required no organic solvent, produced powders with a coarser size distribution and more desirable flow properties.

Therefore, to reach this composition, a different synthesis route has been developed: the cationic solution is added to the soda and for the first time Co3O4 nanoparticles have been synthesized by a direct precipitation in aqueous solution at low temperature. For each composition, the particles are well crystallized and exhibit a size close to 50\u00a0nm. Each particle is composed by several crystallographic domains of about 10\u00a0nm.

     "abstract": "Accurate assessment of liberation state of ore sample is important in mineral processing. In practice, the ore sample is mounted in resin, sectioned, and polished before its liberation state is measured by sectional analysis. This approach typically overestimates the degree of liberation in two-dimensional (2D) measurements. Several models have been proposed to overcome this stereological bias and correct this error in well-examined samples. However, their versatility remains poorly understood. Herein, a stereological correction method was developed for the liberation distribution. First, the complexity of particle sectional texture was assessed using the fractal dimension of the image intensity. Next, the magnitude of stereological bias and 2D measureable parameters such as fractal dimension was correlated by an all-encompassing simulation of various texture types. Finally, stereological correction indices were exclusively estimated from 2D measureable parameters obtained through the correlation. This model exhibited high versatility based on the all-encompassing simulation. The model was validated using nine different irregularly shaped binary particle systems and assessed using areal difference and maximum difference between liberation distribution curves in two and three dimensions. This error indices improved by approximately 80% for the former error index and 90% for the latter index.",

A direct evidence that the exothermicity of the combustion reaction plays an important role in formation of the powders with different morphology was obtained from the scanning and transmission electron microscopies. In contrast to stoichiometric reaction, where the short-string Co3O4 particles form hard agglomerates, the energetically softer 50% fuel lean reaction is responsible for weak bonds between Co3O4 particles and formation of the loose cauliflower-like agglomerates.

The intrinsic driving force, local pressure and current of Mg powders with different particle sizes were analyzed by theoretical calculation. The results obviously indicate that the densification of pure magnesium can be improved by the reduction of particle size, suggesting the intrinsic driving force, local pressure and current intensity are enhanced significantly by a decrease in the particle size at the same sintering conditions, which can promote shrinkage of pores, formation of the sintering neck and mass transportation in the SPS process.

However, the mechanical movement of the large particles is higher than that of small particles due to high punch displacement, and plastic deformation, detected by scanning electron microscopy, plays a main role in densification for large particles in the case during the sintering. Joule heating effect is the key factor for densification of small Mg particles, and high densification degree can be obtained by sintering small particles.",

Thus, investigating the impact of diverse drilling parameters such as pipe rotation on the hole cleaning looks as a key. In this study, the combination of k - \u03b5 turbulent model and Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase model was used to investigate the three phase flow in the concentric annulus. Furthermore, the collision of cutting \u2013 cutting, cutting-drill pipe and cutting-well was considered in the simulations. In the first step, for validating the computational setup, the simulation outcomes were compared with the previous experimental works. The impact of pipe rotation on hole cleaning at various water and air flow rates, inclination and cutting sizes was scrutinized. The simulation results demonstrated that the impact of pipe rotation on the hole cleaning can be different depending on the different hole conditions. In the low inclination and air rates, rising the pipe rotation from 0 to 75\u00a0RPM brings about dropping the cutting concentration, but increasing the pipe rotation from 75 to 125\u00a0RPM comes about raising the cutting concentration. On the other hand, in low inclination and high flow rates of air, rising the pipe rotation causes a high accumulation of cutting. Lastly, at high inclination, the cutting concentration in annulus decreases with increasing the pipe rotation and this is independent of air and water flow rates. The simulation outcomes also showed that the impact of pipe rotation on hole cleaning at large cutting size is not as much as small cutting size.",

In this work, a 2D numerical model was developed to predict the pressure drop and particle penetration for the fibrous filter composed of randomly distributed elliptical fibers. The results show that a big solid volume fraction of filter increases the effective collision area, and enhances the capture at a low face velocity. The particle penetrations through the fibers with the diameter of 5\u00a0\u03bcm are conspicuously weaker than those with the diameter of 10\u00a0\u03bcm, especially at big solid volume fractions and high face velocities. The blunt elliptical fibers restrain the penetration more effectively than the circle ones when the solid volume fraction is high. Though the blunt fibers lead to a large drag force, the increased pressure drop cannot improve the filtration performance at low solid volume fractions. In most cases, the slim elliptical fibers can enhance the filtration performance. A bigger aspect ratio of elliptical fibers leads to a low quality factor, showing the capture efficiency increases with the penalty of a high pressure drop.",

Then, it was shown that graphical structures within the cross recurrence plot of pressure fluctuations of a fluidized bed vary with both superficial gas velocity and particle size. It was found that determinism and cross recurrence rate of non-normalized data initially decrease and then increase with increasing the gas velocity. When the signal is initially normalized, determinism and entropy do not change with the superficial gas velocity while cross recurrence rate is sensible to changes in the superficial gas velocity.

The \u03bcCT results, to the limit of their resolution, show that the error in the calculated surface area caused by assuming spherical particles (a common assumption in PSD measurements) is of unexpectedly similar magnitude (\u221220% to \u221230%) over the entire investigated particle size range, which was approximately 3\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm. This finding is important, because it simplifies relative surface area determination and is thought to be quite general, since the crushed aggregate fines investigated were produced from 10 rock types that had a wide range of mineralogies.",

     "abstract": "This is a theoretical investigation on fully developed mixed convective flow of nanofluids inside microtubes subjected to a constant wall temperature (CWT). The modified Buongiorno model is used for the nanofluids which fully accounts for the distribution of nanoparticles concentration on thermophysical properties. The effect of nanoparticles migration originating from the nano-scale diffusivities including thermophoretic diffusion (temperature-gradient driven force) and Brownian diffusion (concentration-gradient driven force) on the thermophysical characteristics of nanofluids has been considered. A Navier's slip condition is considered at the wall to model the non-equilibrium region at the fluid-solid interface in micro-scale channels. A scale analysis is performed to estimate the relative significance of the pertaining parameters that should be included in the governing equations. The effects of pertinent parameters including the ratio of Brownian motion to thermophoresis (NBT), slip parameter (\u03bb), mixed convective parameter (Nr), and bulk mean nanoparticle volume fraction (\u03d5B) on the flow and thermal fields are investigated. The figure of merit (FoM) is used to measure the thermal performance of equipment and finding the optimum thermal condition. It is shown that increasing the buoyancy force would enhance the heat transfer rate, especially for the larger nanoparticles. Also, larger nanoparticles enhance the thermal performance based on a required heat transfer rate with the lowest penalty in the pressure drop.",

Milling energies (1.6\u00a0kJ/g and 3.2\u00a0kJ/g after milling for 15\u00a0h and 30\u00a0h respectively) were found to enhance the reactivity of chromium carbide powders with Al, and lowered the activation energy of reaction significantly.

     "abstract": "Recovering phosphorus from unconventional sources has gained attention recently due to some estimates predicting a decline in phosphate rock production in the years to come. Recovery of phosphorus from Sewage Sludge Ash (SSA) coming from municipal sewage incineration plants arises as a promising alternative. Nonetheless, the use of simple, straightforward mineral processing techniques for that purpose has not been explored on its entirety yet. This research work studies the recovery of phosphorus from a Japanese SSA via heat treatment followed by the use of High Gradient Magnetic Separation (HGMS) and flotation. The heat treatment was carried out using the addition of 5% of carbon and exposure to temperatures of 540\u00a0\u00b0C and 680\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Measurements using a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer showed that magnetization of SSA increases at higher temperatures, at higher carbon additions, and when a N2 atmosphere is used. On the other hand, when 5% of Fe2O3 was also added before the heating step, the previously detected aluminum-phosphate phase (Ca9Al(PO4)7) is replaced by an iron-phosphate phase (Ca9Fe(PO4)7). HGMS trials using this specimen, pointed out that the \u201cnonmagnetic-rich\u201d fraction was enriched by 7% on a relative basis of P2O5 content. Further treatment of this portion, using flotation at pH 10, revealed that an additional enrichment (i.e. 19% in relative P2O5 content) occurs in the froth when compared with the tailings. The results show evidence that it is possible to promote phosphorus recovery from SSA using a heating treatment followed by these mineral processing methods.",

A novel approach for numerical treatment of nanofluid flow and heat transfer problems was discussed and examined. A boundary condition for partial slip flow due to deposition of nanoparticles was developed and verified. The governing differential equations were solved using the standard finite volume method in OpenFOAM. The method and the numerical solver were hydrodynamically and thermally validated against data extracted from the previous experimental studies. According to the CFD results, two correlations for predication of Nusselt number and friction factor as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction and slip length were presented. Results of this study reveal that the simultaneous consideration of slip length with thermophysical properties of nanofluid leads to a good prediction of hydrodynamic and heat transfer behavior of nanofluid. Besides, using a surface with higher slip length minimized local entropy generation. More reduction in microchannel wall temperature was achieved when higher inlet pressure values were implemented. Furthermore, the addition of Al2O3 nanoparticles to the base fluid improved heat transfer performance, but decreased hydrodynamic efficiency of the system.",

We investigated the effect of the pulverization of coal fly ash on the generation rate and crystalline phase of synthesized zeolite. As a result, it was found that the pulverization process increased the generation rate of phillipsite in the early stage of the hydrothermal treatment because it enhances the dissolution of aluminate and silicate ions from coal fly ash and the generation rate of the aluminosilicate-gel precursor. On the other hand, prepulverization before the hydrothermal treatment and long-term pulverization during the hydrothermal treatment promote the formation of hydroxysodalite rather than phillipsite. In addition, we examined the effect of the addition of an aluminum source on the yield of synthesized phillipsite. This examination revealed that the excess addition of aluminate ions promotes the generation of hydroxysodalite and that timely and proper addition improves the yield of synthesized phillipsite. From these results, it was concluded that pulverization in the early stage of the hydrothermal treatment is effective for the generation of phillipsite from coal fly ash. Moreover, the timely and proper addition of an aluminum source improves the yield of synthesized phillipsite.",

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), quantitative X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM-EDS) have been used for the structural characterization. The decrease in characteristic particle diameter up to 60\u00a0min and then increase is related to particle breakage and aggregation/agglomeration respectively. The manifestation of mechanical activation (MA) during geopolymerisation resulted in enhanced dissolution and precipitation of Si and Al. The appearance of a new FTIR band in 1080\u20131096\u00a0cm\u22121 region in MA geopolymers is attributed to SiQn (n\u00a0=\u00a03\u20134) structural units of quartz. The increment in amorphization in MA fly ash resulted in an increase in crystallinity of geopolymers. The shift in characteristic XRD amorphous hump towards lower d(\u00c5) value in geopolymers is associated with incorporation of OH\u2212 and Na resulting in structural changes in amorphous phase. TEM-EDS revealed that geopolymers from as received fly ash exhibited predominance of primary structures such as nano-crystalline mullite, microcrystalline quartz and alumino-silicate glass. Whereas geopolymers from MA fly ash has shown secondary features mainly N-A-S-H gel, whose nano-porosity increased due to changes in gel characteristic.

Depending on the synthesis parameters of gold concentration in the precursor solution, gas flow and reaction temperature, we have previously obtained a combination of spherical, irregular and cylindrical AuNPs. Two parameters (gold concentration and gas flow) were determined to be the most influential on the shapes and sizes of the produced AuNPs. The effects of these two influential synthesis parameters were evaluated on controlling the formation mechanisms: Gold concentration (2.5 and 0.5\u00a0g/l Au) in the precursor solution of HAuCl4 dissolved in water and gas flows of (i) aerosol carrier gas N2 (1.5, 3.0 and 4.5\u00a0l/min) and (ii) reduction gas H2 (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0\u00a0l/min). Depending on the parameter conditions, the AuNPs are formed from a combination of the liquid/solid phase (Droplet-to-Particle mechanism, DTP), the gas phase (Gas-to-Particle mechanism, GTP) and from intermediate secondary droplets, formed from primary droplet explosions. Increasing the gas flow affected the evaporation of the solvent (water) and diffusion of the solute ([AuCl4]\u2212) in the aerosol droplets, which resulted in the formation of more uniformly shaped AuNPs and with narrower size distributions than before. With favorable parameter conditions increased control over AuNP synthesis with USP has been achieved.",

Three different types of water-based nanofluid with copper, aluminum oxide (alumina) and titanium dioxide (titania) as nanoparticles are considered while the investigation's emphasis is on copper/water nanofluid. Using the local similarity method, it is shown that a set of suitable similarity transformations reduces the non-linear coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) governing on the problem into a set of non-linear coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is solved analytically by the well-known homotopy analysis method (HAM) and numerically using the Keller-box method (KBM). The velocity profile, temperature distribution, skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number are determined for various values of the physical parameters. The computations illustrate that selecting alumina and copper as the nanoparticle leads to the minimum and maximum amounts of skin friction coefficient value, and also copper and titania nanoparticles have the largest and lowest local Nusselt number. Moreover, it can be observed that the spin of the body augments the velocity profiles and compresses the temperature profiles toward the surface where as cause an increasing effect on both the skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number.",

     "abstract": "The particle deposition at a vertical wall roughened by transverse square bars placed at a small spacing between them is investigated using large-eddy simulation of the turbulent flow in a ribbed channel with the gravity aligned in the flow direction together with Lagrangian particle-tracking. It is found that the particle deposition coefficient is substantially increased in the presence of roughness elements, exhibiting a weaker dependence on the variation of particle response time relative to the case of smooth channel. The enhancement ratio of particle deposition varies from three for the larger size particles to about 400 for the smaller particles examined here. The friction-weighted enhancement ratio of particle deposition is higher than unity for all particle sets, indicating that the present ribbed channel configuration efficiently increases particle deposition with respect to the increase in energy losses. The rise in the particle deposition coefficient at the rough surface is closely related to the direct inertial impaction and interception mechanisms. The population of particles depositing at the rear surface of the square bars is very small, revealing that an enlargement of the effective deposition area is not necessarily translated to a similar augmentation of particle removal.",

It was found that with varying of the ultrasound irradiation power, the physico-chemical properties of prepared ZSM-5 changed significantly.

Conceptual approach is proposed for evaluating bi-material interfacial bonding process by means of practical measurements of bond results. Enhanced mechanical and fracture properties are important results of achieving the bond and vice versa. Cracks and failure are direct result of de-bonding. Bond between natural layered silicate-aluminum particles NC and polyolefin such as HDPE has main role of creation of properties of final product. It controls mainly each of mechanical and fracture properties rather than other properties like thermal, chemical and physical. Several parameters share strongly in producing strong bond between nanoclay particles and polymer chains. It is believed that each of nano and micro size, surface area, structure will control the bond. Since there are no direct experimental measurements of interfacial bond, the mechanical and fracture properties can indirectly indicate and predict bond or de-bond process. Therefore, current research shows how mechanical and fracture parameters can explain the assessment of bi-interfacial bond between polymer chains and nano silicate aluminum. Experimental work and characterizations by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) and chemical composition analysis (EDS) are carried out for investigating that phenomenon. The results verify the concept of proposed approach for evaluating bond process.",

The decrease in sieve openings diameter of the hammer mill sieve increased protein content in coarse fractions of sunflower meal obtained at same air flow, and at the same time decreased matching fraction yield. Increase in air flow lead to the increase in protein content along the same hammer mill sieve. Standard score analysis showed that optimum values for protein content and ratio of coarse and fine fractions have been obtained by using a sieve with 1\u00a0mm opening diameter, air flow of 12.5\u00a0m3/h and 60% of the maximum feeder rate. Fraction ratio and protein content were mostly affected by the linear term of air flow and the sieve openings diameter of the hammer mill sieve in the Second Order Polynomial model. The main focus of CFD analysis was on the particle simulation and the evaluation of the separation efficiency of the zigzag classifier.",

This review article describes how this is done, in some detail, and then gives examples of applications of this method, including a contact function that is suitable for these random shape particles.

The present study estimated the interparticle adhesion forces developed in corn starch powder under humid conditions at varying applied consolidation stresses using tensile strength determination approach. Shear test was used to determine tensile strength of powder at 1\u20139\u00a0kPa consolidation pressures and extrapolated values of tensile strength at zero stress were used for force estimation in non-consolidated powders. A strong dependence of interparticle adhesion force on consolidation and RH conditions was observed, mainly due to alteration in the number of adhesive contacts and contact area. The results indicated that, at low consolidation and high RH, capillary force is the prevailing force contributing to the total interparticle adhesion in contrast to higher consolidation conditions where load induced contact force plays a dominant role. Furthermore, for nonconsolidated samples, the adhesion forces registered a steep jump above 60% RH which was primarily attributed to dominance of the liquid bridge forces. Also, forces determined from tensile strength approach and those predicted theoretically, as a summation of individual forces, yielded a similar trend. Overall, a simple and effective approach for interparticle force estimation of consolidated as well as loosely packed powders under varying humidity conditions is presented here.",

The samples are obtained by means of impact sintering method in the temperatures range of 500\u20131100\u00a0\u00b0C. The impact energy was 1200\u00a0J/cm3, and the initial deformation velocity - 6.5\u00a0m/s. Samples are obtained in the form of disks with a diameter of 25\u201327\u00a0mm and 9\u201310\u00a0mm high.

The characteristics of strength and plasticity of samples depending on the impact sintering temperature are determined.

It is established that the high density of samples is reached at a temperature of 600 and 700\u00a0\u00b0C respectively for fine and coarse powders. The samples obtained at these impact sintering temperatures possess rather low electrical resistivity, high strength, hardness, but the lowered plasticity. Namely, the samples from the PZH3M2 and DIAFE5000 powders sintered at the temperature of 700\u00a0\u00b0C have respectively: ultimate tensile strength - 406 and 336\u00a0MPa, yield stress - 353 and 190\u00a0MPa, contraction ratio - 26 and 78%, limit stress (at the fracture) - 501 and 933\u00a0MPa, the maximum crack tip stress \u2013 738 and 876\u00a0MPa, the fracture energy at a bend of the notched samples - 4.8 and 51.2\u00a0J/cm3 and also Brinell hardness - 1467 and 847\u00a0MPa.

The concept of standard deviation attributed to the dispersion of solid volume fraction was used to calculate the intensity of segregation. The simulated results indicated that the mixing of binary mixture was strongly affected by different sizes of rice husk particles. The heat transfer occurring inside the fluidized bed was described by the distribution of solids temperature, the variation of surface heat flux and heat transfer coefficient. Both heat transfer quantities were observed to be dominant in the dense bed regions as they strongly depend on the solids concentration in the fluidized bed.

It is demonstrated that with the increase of [bmim]BF4 concentration in the range of 0\u201335\u00a0g/L, the formation of separated Ni powders and clusters away from Al2O3 surfaces are decreased. This can be explained by preferential adsorption of [bmim]BF4 additive on the protrusions and sharp points of Al2O3 surface to inhibit the fast nucleation and crystal growth of Ni so that uniform Ni-decorated Al2O3 powders is obtained.

This is due to the fact that such synthesis may simultaneously implement the introduction of mesopores into crystalline microporous zeolite structure. Herein, we report the use of natural silica precursors from rice husks in the mesoporogen-free synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 below 100\u00a0\u00b0C and their structural properties which govern the course of crystallization. Rice husks are agricultural wastes with high silica content, which should be exploited to give a positive impact, i.e. highly value-added materials. In this study, the amorphous silica from rice husks was extracted using sequential base-acid treatment. The extracted silica was similarly reactive as Ludox HS-40, even with the reduced amounts of the organic structure-directing agent (OSDA). The product was highly crystalline ZSM-5 with spherical morphology composed of small crystallites, enabling the presence of intercrystallite mesopores. The subjection of extracted silica into the calcination at 550\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h, prior to the low-temperature synthesis, altered the silica structure via hydroxyl condensation. The distinct structural properties affected the occurring crystallization in which the resulted products were ZSM-5\u2013disordered-mesoporous silica composites. The possible mechanisms of these two different results may involve the dual roles of tetrapropylammonium ion (TPA+) as zeolite OSDA and non-templating structure directing agent. These insights were based on the spectroscopic (FTIR, Raman, 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy), microscopic (TEM and HRTEM) and physicochemical characterizations (XRD and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm).",

The analysis is carried out under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximations and the fluid and cilia dynamics is of the creeping type. A Lorentzian magnetic body force model is employed and magnetic induction effects are neglected. Solutions to the transformed boundary value problem are obtained via numerical integration. The influence of cilia length parameter, Hartmann (magnetic) number, heat absorption parameter, Grashof number (free convection), solid nanoparticle volume fraction, and cilia eccentricity parameter on the flow and heat transfer characteristics (including effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid) are examined in detail. Furthermore a comparative study for different nanoparticle geometries (i.e. bricks, platelets and cylinders) is conducted. The computations show that pressure increases with enhancing the heat absorption, buoyancy force (i.e. Grashof number) and nanoparticle fraction however it reduces with increasing the magnetic field. The computations also reveal that pressure enhancement is a maximum for the platelet nano-particle case compared with the brick and cylinder nanoparticle cases. Furthermore the quantity of trapped streamlines for cylinder type nanoparticles exceeds substantially that computed for brick and platelet nanoparticles, whereas the bolus magnitude (trapped zone) for brick nanoparticles is demonstrably greater than that obtained for cylinder and platelet nanoparticles. The present model is applicable in biological and biomimetic transport phenomena exploiting magnetic nanofluids and ciliated inner tube surfaces.",

Nanosized powders with high surface areas were produced via sublimation during the freeze drying process, and by replacement of hydroxyl groups on the precipitate surface with butoxy groups during azeotropic distillation. Both the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B and the antibacterial activity against the pathogens Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were enhanced for dehydration methods that increased the surface area of ZnO NPs, suggesting that both photocatalytic and antibacterial behaviors were governed by similar mechanisms.",

Furthermore, the effect of hopper geometry on powder discharge was investigated with the CPFD model and verified experimentally in some purposely built hoppers.

We therefore focused on a surface acoustic wave (SAW) device, and we experimentally studied an interdigital transducer (IDT) that generates the SAW. As a result, it was found that an IDT with a 2-mm pitch size at a 90\u00b0 inclination angle, against the perpendicular direction of a piezoelectric wafer (127.8\u00b0 y-rotated x-propagating LiNbO3) orientation flat, had a high efficiency of copper powder (about 100-\u03bcm particle size) transport. Then, to investigate the availability of a SAW actuator with this highly efficient IDT, we fabricated a miniature feeder (13-mm height\u00a0\u00d7\u00a018-mm width\u00a0\u00d7\u00a078-mm length) mounted with a hopper on the SAW actuator and carried out a powder supply experiment. As a result, it was found that, when 1\u00a0W of electric power was applied to the IDT of the feeder, the powder supply capability of the feeder was about 18\u00a0mg/s. From this fact, it was experimentally shown that a SAW actuator with a highly efficient IDT has a great potential to control dry powder with superior accuracy.",

Aqueous hydrochloric and nitric acid solutions produce the powders degradation and the subsequent formation of Li2TiO3 and La2Ti2O7 phases. A detailed analysis of the 1H MAS NMR spectra of exchanged samples indicate that Li+/H+ exchange reaction in pure water produced formation of LiOH at the particles surface, band at 0 ppm, that could subsequently carbonated after exposition in air. Furthermore the presence of other OH signals at 8, 6 and 2\u00a0ppm has been related to differences on octahedral Ti-O distances, produced by La/vacancy ordering in alternating planes of perovskites. In samples immersed into benzoic acid/ethanol solution results are similar, however the amount of LiOH species in particle surface is considerable lower. The exchange degree improved when increasing exchange temperature. The mechanical grinding of powders decreases the particle size improving exchange reactions; however, grinding treatments eliminated specific NMR bands of perovskite. In ground materials new 1H NMR bands at 6 and 4\u00a0ppm were ascribed to an amorphous phase.",

The synthesized composites were characterized by XRD, FTIR, BET, TGA, TEM and XPS, which showed that MAGO had been prepared successfully.

The MAGO demonstrated an extremely fast Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solution with a high removal efficiency at low pH.

     "abstract": "Dolomite is an alternative material for producing precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) particles, which have widespread industrial applications depending on their morphology and particle sizes. These properties are readily controlled by the production conditions such as reaction time, temperature, stirring speed, and CO2 flow rate. In this paper, we investigate the influences of these experimental conditions on the production of synthetic aragonite crystals from dolomite using a leaching carbonation process. The proposed process is believed so be more eco-friendly than other methods suggested in the literature because the CO2 released from the dolomite during the leaching stage is stored for use in the carbonation stage. The experimental results indicate that the morphology of the produced PCC is influenced not only by the reaction time and temperature, but also the stirring speed and CO2 flow rate. The required reaction time decreases with an increase in the CO2 flow rates. However, calcite forms along with the aragonite crystals at higher CO2 flow rates. We successfully synthesized pure aragonite crystals in the reaction temperature range of 40\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C at a fixed CO2 flow rate of 3.00\u00a0l/min, and at a stirring speed of 750\u00a0rpm.

Effects of pertinent parameters on velocity, temperature, concentration and density of motile organism distributions are presented and discussed for two flow cases namely suction and injection. The obtained results are validated by comparing with the available previous studies and found good agreement. The thermal and concentration boundary layer are significantly modulated with the rise of thermophoresis and Brownian motion parameters for both suction and injection flow cases. The increasing values of thermophoresis parameter boost up the temperature and concentration field while thermal boundary layer decreased for increasing the Brownian motion parameter. With the rise of Casson fluid parameter, the velocity increases but the temperature, concentration and density of motile organism is found to decrease in both suction and injection flow cases. The influence of the pertinent parameters on the local shear stress coefficient, local Nusselt and local Sherwood numbers are discussed with the assistance of the table for two flow cases separately (suction and injection). The thermal radiation parameter boost up the local Sherwood number, gyrotactic microorganisms mass transfer rate and depreciates the local Nusselt number for the suction and injection flow cases.

Crystallisation of SrMo1\u2212xWxO4 particles took place rapidly using SrSO4 as the Sr precursor under hydrothermal conditions involving stirring (130\u00a0rpm) at 150 or 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Structural analyses of the powders were conducted by XRD with Rietveld refinement and FT-Raman spectroscopy, and the particle shape was observed by FE-SEM. Lattice parameter measurements indicated a linear dependence of both \u201ca0\u201d and \u201cc0\u201d in the scheelite structured SrMo1\u2212xWxO4 with a changing W content following Vegard\u2019s law. These analyses also provided evidence of the structural variation localised in the tetrahedral site as a result of the simultaneous incorporation of MoO4 and WO4 in the solid solutions formed in the compositional range of 9\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0x\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a060\u00a0mol%. The SrMo1\u2212xWxO4 particles exhibited a predominantly euhedral shuttle-shaped morphology and particle sizes varying between 0.75 and 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm. The particle growth was affected by increasing the reaction temperature and the tungsten concentration. Photoluminescence analysis (PL) revealed a marked attenuation of the blue and green emissions preferentially for the powder containing 48.5\u00a0mol% of W, which makes it potentially useful for optoelectronic applications.",

Based on the results obtained using an intentionally oxidized powder of carbonyl nickel (O/Ni(at.)\u00a0=\u00a00.2), we show that when the powder is heated in the SPS chamber but is not in direct contact with graphite foil commonly used in the SPS practice, the reduction of the oxide is limited to the surface layers of the powder bed. Comparative sintering experiments with graphite and copper foils indicate that a direct contact with a source of carbon is critical for the elimination of the oxide from the sintered compact. Compacts/regions of the compacts, in which nickel oxide NiO was reduced, showed more pronounced inter-particle necking than the regions maintaining the initial oxide concentration.",

Their chemical reactivity was successfully studied as a function of this measure of particle size. Differences between sieve analysis and laser diffraction measures of particle size prompted this current re-analysis. Extremely careful sieving was used to divide the crushed waste glass particles into 0\u201325\u00a0\u03bcm, 25\u201338\u00a0\u03bcm, and 63\u201375\u00a0\u03bcm sieve size ranges, but laser diffraction did not agree with these particle size cutoffs. We use these same materials to try and understand the discrepancies between particle size as measured by laser diffraction and sieve analysis by using X-ray computed tomography followed by spherical harmonic analysis to measure the three-dimensional particle shape and size, as well as the length (L), width (W), and thickness (T) of each particle. We show how laser diffraction and X-ray CT results, along with sieve analyses, can be quantitatively related for these crushed waste glass particles in the approximate size ranges considered. In contrast to previous speculation, the particle width W does not have to correspond closely to the sieve opening \u2013 the correspondence depends on overall particle shape. In addition, we demonstrate how many particles are needed to analyze in order to achieve stable averages and distributions of the L/W, W/T, and L/T aspect ratios, which approximately define particle shape. These results have implications for how particle size is measured and interpreted in the cement and concrete and other industries.",

The size of Mo grain was decreased rapidly in the initial stage and then kept a constant in the later stage. After ball milling for 96\u00a0h, the size of Mo grain was up to approximately 8\u00a0nm. Ball milling induced Tm2O3 to be first fined, nano-crystallized, then transformed to amorphization, and finally dissolved into Mo crystal. The supersaturated nanocrystalline solid solution of Mo (Tm, O) was formed after 96\u00a0h of ball milling. Sintering caused Tm and O atoms precipitated from Mo crystal and then formed Tm2O3 precipitates that uniformly distributed in the Mo matrix. After sintered for 12\u201324\u00a0h at 1400\u20131600\u00a0\u00b0C, only diffraction peaks of Tm2O3 and Mo could be observed in the XRD spectrums, which indicated that there was not a chemical reaction between Tm2O3 and Mo. The microhardness of sintered bulks increased with increasing ball-milling time, sintering temperature and time, and the chemical content of Tm2O3 in the powder mixtures.

This paper is the first contribution to the study of entropy generation for the nanofluid flow via exact solution approach. The governing partial differential equations are transformed into nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations via appropriate similarity transformations. The current exact solution illustrates very good correlation with those of the previously published studies in the especial cases. The entropy generation equation is derived as a function of the velocity and the temperature gradients. The influences of the different flow physical parameters including the nanoparticle volume fraction parameter, the magnetic parameter, the mass suction/injection parameter, the stretching/shrinking parameter, and the nanoparticle types on the fluid velocity component, the temperature distribution, the skin friction coefficient, the Nusselt number and also the averaged entropy generation number are discussed in details. This study specifies that nanoparticles in the base fluid offer a potential in increasing the convective heat transfer performance of the various liquids. The results show that the copper and the aluminum oxide nanoparticles have the largest and the lowest averaged entropy generation number, respectively, among all the nanoparticles considered.",

The synthesis based on the principles of the molecular design and integrative chemistry which includes the innovative aerosol and hydro(solvo)thermal nanotechnology routes, the building block assembling and hybridization, represent intelligent platform for the creation of advanced functional materials. Due to exceptional optical properties and a diverse application in electronics, optoelectronics, energy conversion/storage and biomedicine, the examples from some wide band gap oxides for light harvesting and photocatalytic applications as well as both down and up-conversion energy-saving luminescent materials for photonic and biological applications are considered.

The aggregated particle size (Z-average size) in toluene could be successfully reduced to c.a. 100\u00a0nm under saturated adsorption of PEI-OA. It was also found that PEI-OA-modified SiO2 NPs can effectively attach to the Ni FPs by a simple mixing process in toluene.

As a result of the SPS, Si3N4 ceramics with a higher density were obtained using the nanocomposite particles compared with a powder mixture prepared using conventional wet ball-milling. The shrinkage curve of the powder compact prepared using the mechanical treatment was also different from that prepared using the ball-milling, because the formation of the secondary phase identified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method and liquid phase was influenced by the presence of the sintering aids in the powder compact. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed that elongated grain structure in the Si3N4 ceramics with the nanocomposite particles was more developed than that using the powder mixture and ball-milling because of the enhancement of the densification and \u03b1-\u03b2 phase transformation. The fracture toughness was improved by the development of the microstructure using the nanocomposite particles as the raw material.

One coefficient in this function correlates very well with the bulk density measured according to EN ISO 60, while the other coefficient shows a good correlation with a function, combining several dust properties. Using this approximation function equations for the vertical stress and bulk density in the shaft of a cylindrical silo as a function of the distance from the surface were derived. The results for the vertical stress and the mass of the bulk obtained with these equations were compared with those acquired on the basis of Janssen\u2019s equation assuming constant bulk density according to EN ISO 60 and a constant average bulk density. Up to a certain distance from the surface of the bulk the values for the stress and for the mass were between the results obtained by the two variants with constant bulk density, whereas for greater distances the resulting values were higher.",

The FTIR arspectshowed that polyphenols, proteins and organic acids which serve as reducing and stabilizing agents play a significant role in the synthesis of NPs and reduce the possibility of aggregation of NPs compared to chemical techniques of NPs synthesis. The amount and type of compounds in plant extracts affect the structure and also agglomeration of NPs after adsorption process. Based on the results, the highest removal efficiency occurred at pH 2. With increase in contact time and amount of dose, the percentage removal increases. Inversely, increase of initial concentration of Cr(VI) decreases the removal efficiency of the contaminant. These nanoparticles have a high adsorption capacity. Accordingly, by applying a dose of 0.2\u00a0g/l and contact time of 10\u00a0min,\u00a0the three NPs yielded >90% removal efficiency.

The NiAlN catalyst showed nanoparticles of the aforesaid oxides whereas NiAlxOy was the predominant phase found over NiAlW catalyst. The performances of the nickel aluminate-based catalysts were evaluated in glycerol dehydration to produce valuable chemical compounds through the dehydration of glycerol. The sintering effects were responsible for the decreased performance of NiAlC in glycerol dehydration. On the contrary, NiAlN is found to be deactivated due to the lesser stability of its supported nanoparticles, being the glycerol conversion of ca. 3.3% at the end of the reaction. Besides, the reaction efficiently proceeded on NiAlW, which had a high catalytic performance with 19.7% glycerol conversion to acetol and others products and no deactivation along of the time for 25\u00a0h of time on stream was observed. This was due to the stability of the NiAlxOy phase, which impeded phase transformation and was resistant to heavy coking.",

     "abstract": "The mechanical properties of spray dried granules are decisive with regard to further applications and can be modified via internal granule structure. To obtain the correlations between structural and mechanical properties, necessary experiments are often time and resource consuming. The simulation of varied granule structures and their effect on resulting mechanical properties seems to be a promising approach.In this paper, a model of the particulate internal structure of a spray dried granule was generated with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) based on real structure parameters. The model considers real primary particle number, particle size distribution and radial granule inhomogeneity, what results in the implementation of granule shell thickness and macro void. The internal structure of simulated granules showed significant influence on their mechanical properties. An increase of granule shell thickness and packing density of the primary particles within the shell results in fracture strength increase accompanied by decreasing fracture strain. The simulated reduction of the solid bridge bond size between the primary particles representing the decreasing binder amount leads to decreasing fracture strength and strain as previously determined experimentally (Eckhard et al., 2014). Consequently, the DEM is appropriate for evaluating the effect of changed real internal structure parameters on resulting mechanical granule properties.",

The governing equations based on the Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq homogenous models are solved using a pressure-based finite volume method. Four different lid-driven cases are simulated when volume fractions of nanoparticles range from 0.0, 0.03 and 0.05 and the Richardson (Ri) number varies from 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 under both the Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq approximations. Streamlines, isotherms, mid-plane velocities, mid-plane temperature and the average Nusselt (Nu) number in various boundary conditions have been analyzed. Results show that the flow pattern and thermal behavior of the nanofluid strongly depend on the density inversion of water and the presence of nanoparticles. Further, the findings indicate that the density inversion phenomenon leads to a lower average Nu number under the non-Boussinesq approximation compared to the Boussinesq approximation, suggesting that studies with the Boussinesq approximation may overestimate heat transfer performance. In addition, the average Nu number increases as the volume fractions of nanoparticles increase. Finally, the maximum value of the average Nu number can be achieved under the Boussinesq approximation when the shear-driven force is aligned with the buoyancy force.",

Three types of calcium aluminate cements were also incorporated into the dry binder at levels up to 24% by weight in order to modify the chemical composition of the geopolymer source materials. The prepared mortars were tested for workability, setting time, compressive strength, free-alkali content and tendency towards efflorescence formation. FTIR and SEM analyses were also performed to characterize the morphology and structure of the produced geopolymer. The optimized geopolymer mortar exhibited a remarkable maximum compressive strength of 87\u00a0MPa. The results showed that inclusion of calcium aluminate cements in the silica-rich waste-glass powder leads to release high amounts of reactive alumina into aluminosilicate gels, improving the geopolymerization reactions and resulting in the formation of a more cross-linked network that exhibits higher compressive strength. High alumina cement Secar 71 showed the greatest effect in strength enhancement due to the higher amount of reactive alumina releasing into the reaction medium. The findings demonstrate a new potential of value-added reuse application for waste-glass powder by adding a suitable amount of materials that are rich in reactive alumina.",

For studying of stability of nanocomposites, Fe+3 ions, as a cheap and available cocatalyst, was inserted into mordenite matrix (Fe3+/MOR) by impregnation method. The hybrid material (AgBr/Ag2CO3) was synthesized in the Fe3+/MOR matrix by precipitation method. The cycle experiments on the AgBr/Ag2CO3-Fe/MOR nanocomposite indicated that cocatalyst, not only to improve photocatalytic activity, but also enhance photoinduced stability of photosensitive silver compounds in all cycles with respect to MOR. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity and photoinduced stability of silver compounds by Fe3+ cocatalyst was proposed. The mordenite support played an important role in decreases of recombination of photogenerated electrons-holes and increases of MB absorption. The Fe cocatalyst reduced photocorrosion of silver compounds.",

     "abstract": "Titanium aluminide based alloys have shown significant potential in high temperature applications, but the high production cost of TiAl considerably limits its utilisation. Although the use of powder metallurgy processes can reduce the cost by minimising post-machining, an economical powder production route is still required. Therefore, in the present study a pre-alloyed Ti-48Al powder is developed using an elemental Ti and Al powder blend prepared using a simple vacuum heat treatment. A formation model of the intermetallic phases (i.e. TiAl, Ti3Al, TiAl2, TiAl3) during powder synthesis is proposed. In order to improve the sinterability, various milling methods (i.e. ball, attrition and shatterbox milling) are examined to reduce the particle size. The sintered microstructures, particularly the two-phased (\u03b12-Ti3Al \u03b3-TiAl) lamellar structures are also investigated. Improved densification is achieved at 1300\u00a0\u00b0C, held for 2\u00a0h, using the manufactured powder, compared to the elemental powder blend (\u223c55%). With higher sintering temperatures or longer hold periods, increased density TiAl components are possible.",

     "abstract": "This paper evaluated the potential of counter current spray drying to produce engineered crystalline particles in-situ. One main feature of the counter current spray dryer is in inducing droplet drying history with a progressively increasing drying rate; in contrast to a co-current spray dryer in which the particle is immediately confronted with high driving force of evaporation. In addition, counter current dryer provides higher residence time for particles within the drying chamber. This work explored the manipulation of these unique features of counter current spray drying to control the crystallinity of the particles formed. Sucrose, lactose and mannitol were spray dried as model materials exhibit contrasting crystallization. Counter current spray drying was suitable in producing well defined crystalline lactose particles mainly due to the higher residence time. The produced lactose particles were composed of agglomeration of fine thin lactose crystals. Surprisingly, the counter current spray drying with relatively lower initial evaporation rate resulted in amorphous mannitol particles. Fully crystalline mannitol was produced when the feed spray temperature was elevated leading to rapid supersaturation. This may be an important strategy to control the crystallinity of mannitol particles particularly for pharmaceutical application. Similar feed pre-heating strategy in conjunction with counter current spray drying was used for sucrose drying. Crystalline sucrose was achieved with relatively lower drying temperature. This will be a valuable strategy for producing free flowing sucrose particles specifically for the food industry.",

The current conventional flocculant-mediated and gravity-assisted thickening processes used in industry are far from being efficient in terms of maximising pulp water recovery. The present work investigates an unconventional approach using anionic, highly cross-linked polyacrylate, superabsorbent polymer to dewater slurries of three, unflocculated and flocculated, low-grade nickel (Ni) laterites ores (goethitic, siliceous goethite and saprolitic). The superabsorbent (SAB) sealed in a water permeable polyester bag was applied over 24\u00a0h contact time at 1\u20135\u00a0wt.% dosage to dilute (2\u20138\u00a0wt.% solid) and 20\u201325\u00a0wt.% solid, self-settled and polyacrylamide (PAM, 0\u2013400\u00a0g/t solid) flocculated sediments generated at 10\u22123 \u2013 2\u00a0M solution ionic strength, pH 2.5\u201310.5 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The results showed that SAB water absorption of 80\u201390\u00a0wt.% occurred within 8\u00a0h, reflecting sediment consolidation to 40\u201355\u00a0wt.% solid. SAB water recovery capacity was maximum at dosages of 3 and 2\u00a0wt.%, respectively, for dilute and concentrated slurries and at pH 6.0\u20137.0. The SAB-mediated pulp dewaterability, however, decreased markedly with increasing ionic strength and smectite clay mineral content. Slurries\u2019 pre-flocculation at up to 400\u00a0g PAM/t solid had a noticeable impact on SAB\u2019s dewatering efficacy which decreased appreciably with increasing flocculant dosage. The regeneration and recycle trials of the superabsorbent showed that there is unique opportunity for multiple use and greater pulp water recovery with a given sample. Both the water absorption and release capacities, however, decreased steadily with increasing number of superabsorbent recycles.",

This work presents the first in depth study of the effect of TMOMS concentration on silica particles produced by both of these synthetic methods by comparing their size, morphology and chemical structure. The PEI-silica particles were larger in size and greater in yield than the NaOH-silica particles. It was also determined that both species of silica particles are hydrophobic without requiring further surface modification; and that those made with PEI have a higher contact angle, perhaps due to more complete polymerisation. The results demonstrate how relatively facile synthesis routes can wield a high degree of control over the physicochemical properties of silica particles, which is of paramount importance in silica production process intensification.",

In this study, a modified analysis technique was implemented into filament single droplet drying to observe the changes in component distribution of two milk model emulsions with drying time as well as the impact thereof on the water evaporation resistance and shrinkage behaviour. The drying droplets were cryogenically flash-frozen at discrete drying times and, subsequent to freeze-drying, investigated in terms of their chemical surface composition and internal fat and protein distribution. The droplets of a high-fat milk model emulsion were covered by a continuous fat film throughout the whole drying process, whereas the droplets of a low-fat model emulsion featured a surface overrepresentation of protein in comparison to the bulk concentration. The protein further enriched near the surface with increasing drying time. In the high-fat system, the lipid surface film reduced the extent of particle shrinkage and impeded the drying process.",

In the present study, we developed a flow synthetic process by applying a microreactor with a high mixing performance to silica@Au nanoshells and patchy particles. Following a concept of selective nucleation and subsequent growth of the gold on the core surface, we mixed a suspension of surface-modified silica particles containing gold ions with a reducing agent solution in the microreactor, and investigated the effects of the core particle size and the type of reducing agents on the composite particle synthesis. Through the investigation, we found that the ratio of the gold ion amount to the surface area of core particles is a key factor for obtaining uniform core-shell particles. In addition, the morphology of gold formed on the core surface was demonstrated to change from spherical nanoparticles to dendritic patches depending on the reducing ability of reducing agents.",

     "abstract": "Gas-solid fluidised beds are widely used in chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, biochemical and powder industries. Particles used in gas-solid fluidised beds often differ in size and/or density, thus have the tendency to segregate under certain operating conditions. The results of our earlier work (Alghamdi et al., 2013) showed that for a given binary mixture, the transition from segregation to mixing occurred when the superficial gas velocity was increased over a critical value. In this study, force analysis at particle scale, including particle-particle, particle-wall and particle-fluid interacting forces, has been performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms that drive the occurrence of the transition.The results showed that as the superficial gas velocity increased, the system exhibited three sequential states: segregated, transition, and mixed. The vertical fluid force acting on the particles was found to be responsible for the occurrence of the transition from segregation to mixing, at which the bulk density of the heavy (small) particle species became smaller than the actual density of the light (large) species. After the occurrence of the transition, the particle collisional effects were dominant over the fluid viscous effects in governing the gas-solid two-phase flow. After the system became mixed, the net force of fluid and particle net weight forces conversely tended to separate the particles. However, the particle dispersion induced by particle collisions counterbalanced the particle segregation, acting as the main mechanism driving the good mixing of the binary particle species. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data.",

These wastewaters are rich in phosphorus (P), and can be used as a potential source for struvite crystallisation for fertilizer production and environmental pollution abatement. However, this technique is hindered by the presence of foreign ions, especially calcium, which is present in high concentrations in dairy waste. This work aims to resolve the negative extent of the effect of calcium on struvite crystallisation to establish quantitative recommendations around where P recovery using this method is feasible. The impact of calcium concentration on the purity, morphology and particle size was assessed using laboratory experiments, mimicking the composition of typical dairy wastewaters, at a pH of 9 and room temperature. The results indicate that only at high Ca:Mg concentration ratios of more than one did the calcium adversely affect the product morphology and the fraction of struvite in the final product. There was negligible effect when the calcium concentration was low. Furthermore, a high ammoniac nitrogen concentration mitigated the negative impact, and therefore has to be taken into consideration when wastewaters with both high calcium and nitrogen content are considered as feedstock.",

     "abstract": "Instant whole milk powder is designed to rapidly dissolve in water, which depends on the particle size distribution (PSD). The fragile powder exiting the dryer is conveyed for packing which breaks down the particles, worsening the dissolution properties. This work investigated the effect of conveying on the final functional properties using two industrial plants with differing transport systems; a pneumatic system and bucket elevator. It was expected that the plant with the bucket elevator consistently produced powder with superior dissolution due to lower breakdown during transport. This was evaluated using the change in PSD. It was found that the plant with the bucket elevator had at least as large a change in the median particle size as the plant with the pneumatic transport system, contrary to the expectation. However, the plant with the bucket elevator had an initially larger particle size, and so the percentage of fine particles that negatively impact dissolution, remained low post transport. When quantified using the change in bulk density, having an initially low bulk density compensated for large increases in bulk density during conveying and powder with lower bulk density pre-transport showed better wettability post transport. Thus in order to produce powder with the desired functionalities the focus should be on improving the initial agglomeration and generating larger particles and lower bulk density pre-transport, as opposed to optimising the powder transport.",

     "abstract": "In an agglomerated particle heap leach process, the pore network structure within the agglomerates and the particle bed is a critical determinant of efficient lixiviant flow. During the leaching period a degree of slumping can occur, changing the structure of the inter-particle void spaces and the porosity of the particle bed. The ability to characterise the agglomerate pore network structure and measure its changes over the leach period is essential for the understanding and improvement of lixiviant flow and the ultimate performance of the heap. Three dimensional (3D) non-destructive X-ray micro-tomography (XMT) offers a great opportunity to provide detailed spatially resolved structural information of these multiphase particulate systems. The aims of this paper are to compare and contrast the dynamic pore network structure of saprolitic (SAP) and goethitic (G) Ni laterite mineral agglomerate beds undergoing acid leaching by periodic scanning with XMT, as well as to extract quantitative porosity information from this data and correlate it with/to other measures of bed stability, specifically mass loss and particle bed slump. The resulting XMT analyses were able to reliably discriminate between solid and gas phases, enabling the estimation of porosity from the segmented images which in turn agreed well with the measured mass loss and slump. The SAP particle bed has consistently higher porosity and leach stability compared to the G particle bed and this is consistent with the higher HL processability of SAP ores compared to G ores observed in other studies.",

Meanwhile the effects of dielectric media on the size distribution were also investigated. It was found that the size distribution of the particles in pure water is narrower than that in kerosene, but when the ultrasound was introduced into the generating process, the size distributions of the particles in both media have remarkable improvements (both became narrower). Based on the attaching and entrapping processes, the formation mechanism of different structural particles was also presented.

     "abstract": "This work aims to verify the feasibility and broaden the application of utilizing acicular microfiber sepiolite to make reinforced geopolymer composites. Compressive strength, flexural strength and microstructure of fly ash-metakaolin (MK) geopolymer activated by sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide solutions blended with 0\u201320% sepiolite by mass with an interval of 5% were investigated. The experimental results reveal that sepiolite exhibits little effect on compressive strength before 3 days of curing. After 7 days, the addition of up to 10% sepiolite improves compressive strength, however, a further increase in the sepiolite leads to decrease in strength. Similarly, up to 10% sepiolite addition exhibits improving effect on flexural strength regardless of days of curing. With the increasing addition levels of sepiolite up to 10%, compact matrix can be observed compared to the reference geopolymers. Some crack can still be observed in specimen containing 20% sepiolite as compared to specimens containing 10% sepiolite. For geopolymer containing 10% sepiolite, cumulative intrusion volume corresponding to the porosity decreases. Further addition of sepiolite enlarges the cumulative intrusion volume and shifts the most probable pore diameters to higher values. The results from mechanical properties and microstructure observation are compatible. This work indicates that the optimal replacement of sepiolite in geopolymer is not exceeding 15%, and sepiolite is beneficial for compressive and flexural strength as well as pore refinement and denser microstructure. It will broaden the application of sepiolite in geopolymer composites.",

The rate and extent of density segregation decreased with increasing amount of liquid present in the wet binary granular mixtures. The average orders of magnitudes of particle-particle collision forces and capillary liquid bridge forces were similar for both types of particles for all wet binary granular mixtures considered and this explained the difficulty for individual particles to be removed from one agglomerate and be transferred onto another agglomerate for density segregation to occur.",

The influences of vibration time, frequency, amplitude, vibration acceleration (vibration intensity), particle size ratio of large versus small particles, composition of the binary mixtures (volume fraction of large particles), and container size (wall effects) on the packing density of the binary cylindrical particles were discussed and analyzed. The results indicate that for each fixed composition and size ratio, high packing density can be obtained by properly controlling the vibration conditions. Appropriate composition (e.g. 72\u00a0vol.%, volume fraction of large cylinders in current work) with large size ratio can contribute to the high packing density. Increasing the container size can reduce the container wall effects and obtain dense packing. Through extrapolation, the maximum packing density of binary cylindrical particles without container wall effects can reach about 0.8822, which agrees well with the proposed analytical model in literature.",

This novel numerical approach allows for assessment of the mechanical properties and morphological features of the agglomerates. An interesting outcome is that the fractal dimension depends on the material properties represented via interaction energy. The agglomerate porosity increases with increasing agglomerate mass and may approach unity. With increasing Hamaker constant and fixed particle size, the agglomerates are characterized by a lower fractal dimension, higher packing porosity, higher mechanical strength, larger agglomeration size, and lower crystalline fraction. For a fixed Hamaker constant, agglomerates of the smaller primary particles exhibit a more compact packing structure, higher mechanical strength, smaller agglomerate size, and higher crystalline fraction. The local structure analysis indicates that for a fixed Hamaker constant, there are more particles in crystalline structure within the agglomerates constituted by the smaller primary particles. Likewise, for a fixed primary particle size, a lower Hamaker constant allows particles to configure into more stable agglomerate structures, thus providing useful insights into agglomerate morphology.",

Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effects of the three parameters, the Reynolds number (250\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0Re\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0650), nanoparticles volume fraction (0.01\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0\u0424\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a00.05) and nanoparticles diameter (40\u00a0nm\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0dp\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0100\u00a0nm) on the heat transfer performance and nanoparticles distribution. In addition, the effective parameters analysis is performed utilizing the Response Surface Methodology. The results indicated that increasing the Re number and \u0424 and decreasing of dp, enhances the mean total Nusselt number. Also, an enhancement in dp and \u0424 and reduction of Re number increases the homogeneity of the nano-fluid. In addition, it is found that the sensitivity of the mean total Nusselt number to Re number, \u0424 and dp parameters is more than the sensitivity of the nanoparticles concentration ratio to these parameters.",

Ce(NO3)3\u00b76H2O powders were employed as a raw material and a cerium nitrate solution was used as a precursor. The liquid precursor was injected into a cylindrical reactor through two different directions: the vertical and the horizontal direction. The difference of the properties of CeO2 nanocrystalline powders according to the directions of injection were investigated by using XRD, TEM and an UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer. For the horizontal case, the cylindrical reactor acted as a cyclone providing greater tangential velocities. The higher tangential velocities increased the centrifugal forces of as-synthesized powders causing the thicker deposition layer of powders at the upper part of the reactor. The thicker deposition layer of powders was considered as the reason of the less heat treatment of powders prepared. This was confirmed by the relatively lower intensities of XRD peaks. In addition, CeO2 nanocrystalline powders were tested as a photocatalyst using the gaseous 2-propanol decomposition. For the test, the photocatalytic activity was defined and evaluated. It appears that CeO2 nanocrystalline powders are more suitable for the treatment of the dyes in the wastewater than the removal of the volatile organic compound (2-propanol).",

     "abstract": "Synthesis of microcapsulation of Na2SO4\u00b710H2O for latent heat storage using water-in-oil (W/O) was proposed. Effect of water soluble polymers such as polyethyleneimie (PEI), poly (acrylic acid) (PAA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on formation of Na2SO4 contained SiO2 microcapsule was investigated. These polymers were added in the water phase with Na2SO4 aq. and Tween 20 as a surfactant. To increase stability of the W/O emulsion, Span 80 as a surfactant and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) as thickner were also added in 1-octaol as oil phase. The stable W/O emulsion promotes SiO2 shell formation at a W/O interface. PEI and PAA, which have positively and negatively ionized groups, didn\u2019t capsulate Na2SO4. They have strong interactions between Na+ or SO42\u2212 and COO\u2212 or N+, which prevent from stable W/O emulsion. PEG, PVA, and PVP successfully formed SiO2 microcapsules including Na2SO4, which were confirmed by an elemental analysis. Although there were no large difference in Na2SO4 content in the PEG, PVA, and PVP-derived microcapsules, the heat storage amount of the PEG-derived microcapsule was the best in the three. Heat resistance of the PEG-derived microcapsule was much higher than those of the PVA and PVP-derived ones, therefore, it seems that interactions between Na2SO4\u00b710H2O and the polymers affect reactions between dehydration and hydration. The other difference of PEG with PVA and PVP seems to be affinity with Tween 20. PEG has high affinity with Tween 20 due to similar chemical structure compared to the other two. It is thought that PEG surrounds Na+ and SO42\u2212 including much amount of H2O, and Tween 20 can additionally cover PEG/Na+, SO42\u2212, and H2O. Because of such designed structure, dehydrated Na2SO4 hydrates with H2O near itself to form quasi Na2SO4\u00b710H2O during cooling process. That is why PEG-derived microcapsule exhibited high heat storage performance.",

     "abstract": "One technique for improving particle flowability is the admixture of nano-particles to the main particles. However, the mechanisms by which this technique improves flowability are not yet fully understood. In this study we examined compressed packing, which is affected by particle flowability. In order to investigate the mechanism of improvement, discrete element method (DEM) simulation was used to investigate the effects of adhesion forces and rotations of admixed particles on packing fraction.We conducted two types of calculations: (1) compressed packing behavior of a particle bed, and (2) particle behavior in a simple model of the relative motion of two of the main particles. The main and admixed particles were given diameters of 400 and 20\u00a0nm, respectively. The physical properties of the particles were set based on silica and glass materials. The Hamaker constant of the main particles was kept constant while that of the admixed particle was varied from 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221227 to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221220\u00a0J. Simulations were also conducted both allowing and not allowing rotation of admixed particles.In the packing behavior calculations, the results for the packing fraction of the main particles and the compression velocity exhibited peaks at a Hamaker constant of approximately 10\u221223\u00a0J for the admixed particles under 43.8\u00a0Pa compression pressure, regardless of the degree of rotation of the admixed particles. This showed that rotation of the admixed particles was not the main reason for the improvement in main particle flowability, and this peak tendency was determined by the Hamaker constant of the admixed particles. In addition, an improvement in the particle flowability via different numbers of layers of admixed particles was explained using a linked rigid-3-bodies model. This implies that the improvement in the flowability is due to a decrease in the resistance of particle movement by changing the configuration to a linked rigid-3-bodies model.",

The glycine - water - L-leucine (template compound) system was used.From the observations of the behavior of crystals on the template interface and our previous studies, it was suggested that there was an exclusive zone between neighboring crystals at the template interface and no additional nucleation occurred. Observation results were analyzed based on the assumption that no additional nucleation occurred between neighboring crystals. The spread of crystals was analyzed by the application of Hubble\u2019s law. As the result, it was confirmed that initial crystals were generated at one starting point and spread without additional new crystals forming between crystals on the template interface. From the reasons mentioned above, crystallization phenomena at the template interface can be applied to production of the crystals with a narrow CSD.",

The Reynolds number of modeling was 10, nanoparticles volume fractions were chosen from 0.0% to 6.0% and Richardson numbers varied from 0.1 to 10. The findings were depicted for dimensionless axial velocity, coefficient of friction and Nusselt number profiles as well as dimensionless temperature contours. The validity of model was excellent compared to former numerical and experimental studies. The results showed that the heat transfer and hydraulics behavior of nanofluids in curved geometries is to some extent different with other geometries and flat surfaces due to presence of buoyancy and centrifugal forces at the same time. Especially, in the regions near and after 45\u00b0 curvature angle, the behavior of heat transfer and nanofluid flow is unpredictable. In this region, increasing the nanoparticles volume concentration or transition from forced convection regime to free convection state, cause a decrease in Nusselt number and friction factor. That\u2019s while for the entrance region of microtube, the results are completely opposite; increasing the Richardson number or nanoparticle concentration enhances the heat transfer as well as friction factor.

It is found that increased concentration and temperature of the nanofluid lead to increasing aggregation and settling rate of nanoclusters. The results also show that the reducing fractal dimension at certain concentrations of primary nanoparticles leads to an increasing rate of nanocluster aggregation.

     "abstract": "Recent attempts in nanoscience and technology have established nanofluid as suitable coolant for wide ranging heat transfer applications. A mathematical model is developed to study the heat transfer in rotating flow of nanofluids over an exponentially stretching plate. The purpose of undertaking this study is twofold. Firstly, to analyze the simultaneous influence of nanofluid rotation and exponential stretching on the shear stresses and heat transfer rate at the sheet which have obvious role in metal working and polymer extrusion processes. Secondly, to explore the cooling capability of water based nanofluids comprising Cu, Ag, CuO, Al2O3\u00a0and\u00a0TiO2 nanoparticles for the present problem. The effective thermal conductivity of nanofluid is estimated through the Maxwell model which is valid for spherical nanoparticles. The three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are first simplified through classical boundary layer approximations and then non-dimensionalized through the similarity transformations. Numerical computations are made through the Runge-Kutta integration based standard shooting procedure. Newton\u2019s method is implemented to evaluate the unknown initial conditions. A comparative study of present computations with the existing literature shows an excellent agreement. It is found that both rotation and stretching have significant influence on velocity and temperature profiles. Wall shear stresses increase and heat flux from the wall diminishes when fluid is subjected to larger rotation rate. Nanoparticle volume fraction plays a significant role in enhancing cooling rate of the stretching sheet. Maximum value of heat transfer coefficient is observed for Al2O3 nanoparticles. For \u03bb = 1 , about 27% rise in heat transfer rate is observed when volume fraction of Al2O3 particles is varied from 0 to 0.2. The results demonstrate that nanoparticles in water can serve to improve the cooling process of stretching surface which would be beneficial in polymer extrusion processes and coating related applications.",

In this work, a mathematical analysis of particle fluidization has been carried out by employing a combined approach of discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The emphasis is focused on the influence of the aspect ratio on the fluidization behavior of rodlike particles. The predictions of the minimum fluidization velocity are comparable to the available empirical correlations. The bed permeability and coordination number are determined by both the bed porosity and the particle shape. Meanwhile, the particle shape has a significant effect on the contact force and particle velocity. The results suggest that the shape parameters such as the sphericity or aspect ratio should be taken into account when establishing a phase diagram in terms of the coordination number and porosity. The evolution of particle orientation is strongly related to the dynamics of bubbles, and the degree of horizontal alignment of particles could be greatly reduced as the bed is well fluidized.

The restructuring of an aggregate from initial structure toward a stable structure is well presented by a linear relation between the saturation degree of particle connection, and the inversed strength of aggregate. The dynamics of restructuring for different initial configuration of aggregate, from very loose to dense, in various simple shear flow condition is numerically performed. The temporal change in properties of aggregate is analyzed in terms of coordination number and volume fraction. The simulation employs Stokesian dynamics for the estimation of many-particle hydrodynamic interaction while the particle\u2013particle interaction is calculated by van der Waals potential. Simulation results show that the aggregate restructures and exists in a stable state corresponding to the shear flow condition. The transition among the stable aggregates somewhat expresses reversible behavior. Especially in weak flow, the aggregate gradually reaches its limit structure whose properties such as coordination number and volume fraction are typically determined. Such limit aggregate plays an important role for predicting the restructuring of any non-fractal aggregate in any fluid condition.

A two-stage ball milling circuit algebra was employed to predict the capacity, circulation ratio, and size distributions. Comparison of the simulated results and the observed values showed that the model represents accurately the actual milling process in the plant. Simulation results indicated that the classification in the milling process was operated under non-optimal conditions, and that an increase in the mill output of more than 47% was possible simply by modifying the cut size of the classifier.",

A pharmaceutical tablet is an example where a composite packing (a packing containing a mixture of several kinds of particles) is compacted in the process of tablet formation. In this work, the unidirectional compaction and the breakage processes in composite packings formed from a mixture of breakable needle-shaped crystals and elastic spherical filler particles were studied using a Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation. The evolution of crystal size distribution and contacts topology with the increasing stress was computed for different relative size, volume fraction and elasticity of filler particles inside the packing. We show that crystals breakability in a packing is directly related to the number of contacts among particles and that it can be significantly influenced by an appropriate choice of added filler particles. The results can be used for the development of mathematical models that describe the pharmaceutical tablet production and other processes involving composite packings of fragile particles.",

     "abstract": "The optimal design of sensor location and setup is essential to ensure the accuracy and precision of in-line process monitoring of water/moisture content. This manuscript presents a systematic framework of using Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to monitor moisture content in an alumina mulling process that is commonly used in the upstream operation of catalyst supports production. For this, the optimal conditions of NIR sensor setup and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of a mulling process have been first identified and then calibration models for monitoring moisture at various conditions were developed and validated. The results suggest that there is a strong relationship between sensor setup and prediction accuracy. Therefore, optimal conditions such as operating distance of the NIR sensor, sample thickness and acquisition number need to be identified prior to installment of the sensor into the manufacturing plant. In mulling processes, the particle size distribution (PSD) and surface roughness/smoothness can also vary during operation, making the monitoring of moisture content a difficult task. In this study, the effects of PSD and powder surface characteristics on moisture content measurement has been investigated and it has been found that if suitable raw data preprocessing has been applied, the effect of agglomerate size and sample surface characteristics on the accuracy of the in-line measurements can be significantly minimized. This will allow the use of a single calibration model for a range of PSDs and powder bed smoothness/roughness and that will save a significant amount of time and resources. Here, a mulling process where a microNIR sensor has been used for monitoring of moisture content has been considered as a demonstrative example. However, the approach is generic and can be applied for any combination of process and sensor.",

However, changes in material properties of the final blend were observed. Those changes, and their effects on tablet characteristics, are discussed in this paper. Variations in particle size, powder flow properties and hydrophobicity of the blend were examined. The final blend was compressed into tablets. The tableting compression force, and tablet hardness, weight and dissolution were investigated. Overall, powder blend and tablet properties were significantly affected by acceleration, blending time and total energy input. The total energy input to the blend can be efficiently calculated within error in the RAM; this is not true for most mixers. Trends between total energy input and the material properties of the blends and tablets were obtained. Resonant acoustic mixing is a good choice for blending low concentrations of cohesive APIs. Care must be taken when blending hydrophobic lubricants in the RAM; the high energy input can adversely affect critical tablet properties such as hardness and dissolution. The known energy input can be used to predict the performance of blends and final products processed in a RAM.",

Validation is made comparing with former researchers and the distance effect is studied by comparing the hydrodynamic forces, particle induced extra dissipation, turbulent kinetic energy, and the synchronous rate of the cross-stream forces. It is shown that, under a mean flow with turbulent intensities, with enlarging the particle distances, the wake shedding behind the upstream particle is longer; the magnitudes of the stream-wise hydrodynamic forces exerted on both particles are higher. Increased turbulent intensity of the inlet condition or increased particle Reynolds number contributes to the particle induced kinetic energy and the increase of Reynolds number diminishes the difference on the particle boundary at its lateral sides. The monotonic decrease of synchronous rate of the cross-stream forces is observed with increasing particle distances when Rep\u00a0=\u00a080, while it fails under higher Reynolds number.",

The results indicated that with increasing the In3+ co-doping concentration, the intensity of excitation and emission spectra was continuously increased, reached maximum at In3+ concentration of 5\u00a0mol%, and then was diminished for higher In3+ content which indicated concentration quenching. The distinct enhancement of the photoluminescence of YVO4:Eu3+, In3+ phosphors at lower In3+ co-doping concentration can be attributed to the incorporation of In3+ improving the host lattice absorption of YVO4.

The influences of the impact velocity, the sphere size and the plate thickness on the impact behavior had been investigated.The measurement values had been compared with the theoretical predictions of the Hertz and the Zener models. Thereby, a detailed discussion is presented about the inadequacy of the Hertz model to accurately predict the contact time (in comparison to the better applicable Zener model) for a sphere impacting on an infinitely extended elastic plate of finite thickness, where longitudinal and transversal waves can propagate and travel several times (below the contact area) through the plate within the contact time whereby flexural waves arise. Similarly, the limitations of the Zener model such as the overestimations of the CoR (due of negligence of energy dissipation by friction and viscous damping) are also illustrated with help of experimental results and thereby, the effective limits of reliability of the Zener model are discussed considering the underestimations of the contact time for thin plates.",

The second approach is based on viscoelastic mechanism of energy dissipation, represented by an additional viscoelastic damping coefficient. Thus, these two coefficients are responsible for bending and viscoelastic energy dissipation and are calculated independently from each other. The summarized energy dissipation is used to determine both material parameters and coefficients. A good agreement between calculated and measured coefficient of restitution was observed. In this way, the interaction between steel spheres impacting on glass plates with a thickness comparable to the diameter of the sphere was calculated as an example.",

Cubic spinel structure emerged on calcining the xerogel (for just 2\u00a0h) at temperatures as low as 500\u00a0\u00b0C with an average crystallite size of 8\u00a0nm. Heating xerogel at higher temperatures (700 and 900\u00a0\u00b0C for the same duration) yielded products with average crystallite size of 27 and 41\u00a0nm, respectively. The existence of Mg2+, Fe2+ and Fe3+ in tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the spinel structure have been evidenced from the presence of bands at 211, 322, 470, 541 and 701\u00a0cm\u22121 in the Raman spectrum of the sample. Optical band gap of 1.94\u00a0eV has been deduced from UV\u2013visible spectroscopic analysis. MgFe2O4 (obtained at 900\u00a0\u00b0C) showed a typical super paramagnetic behavior with a saturation magnetization of 22.021\u00a0emu/g at room temperature. It showed BET surface area of 21.28\u00a0m2/g with an average pore size of 12.19\u00a0nm.

Firstly, two different routes were used to incorporate the ceramic nanoparticles within the polymeric matrix: Attrition Milling (AM) and Cryogenic Milling (CM). Samples composition was not varied, while milling time was changed. The main objective was to investigate the mechanical physical union of TiO2 nanoparticles around polymeric microparticles. The effect of ceramic particles on the structure and morphology of the polymer, as well as the influence of the temperature of the different combining processes were studied. The fundamental properties of the nanocomposite mixture were investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Laser Scattering (LS Beckman Coulter) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD).

We analysed the effects of the liquid content and rotation speed on the segregation index, angle of repose, and velocity of particles in the rotating drum. The experimental results reveal that the liquid content and rotation speed have significant influences on density-induced granular segregation behavior. The intensity of segregation is mitigated with a rise in liquid content because of the stronger cohesive force between particles.

Since organic solvent evaporation/extraction methods have been successfully employed to produce PSm, this work evaluates the influence of different parameters (i.e., polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) concentrations, temperature, stirring speed and the organic/aqueous phase ratio) on the final size of the PSm; and the relationship between this final size and the radiometric capacities of the PSm in relation to emitters of both beta (3H, 14C and 90Sr/90Y) and alpha (241Am) radiation.The results show that when the concentration of PVA is increased, the size of the PSm decreases; meanwhile, an important decrease in particle size is also achieved when the PS concentration is decreased. For almost all the parameters evaluated, the resultant PSm were smoothed and spherical. However, when temperature was increased, the particle size increased and the PSm eventually became amorphous and porous. The observed decrease in particle size correlated with an increase in radiation detection efficiency and a movement in the positioning of the spectra at lower energy values.We also evaluated the reproducibility of the vial preparation for 3H measurements and confirmed that small variations in the quantity of PSm and preparation of different vials by different experimenters did not influence the radiometric capacities.",

The governing equations were formulated using both the Boussinesq (B) and non-Boussinesq (NB) homogenous models and were solved on a non-uniform mesh using a pressure-based finite volume method.

Rational explanations were provided for why certain mechanical properties were correlated well with pellet qualities. To that end, willow was ground with two different screen sizes (3.175\u00a0mm and 6.350\u00a0mm) and conditioned at two moisture contents (17.5% and 20.0% w.b.). The physical and mechanical properties of ground willow and pellet qualities were determined. Ground willow and switchgrass exhibited similar trends of mechanical properties, however, the magnitudes were different. For ground willow, compression index correlated well with strength of willow pellets, however, bulk modulus and spring-back index showed high correlations in case of switchgrass. This could be an attribute of different physical properties, i.e., particles size distribution, bulk density, and particle density, and chemical compositions. Higher levels of lignin present in willow than switchgrass might produce significant effect of resistance to compressibility.

     "abstract": "The effects of element addition, Co, Cu, and Ag on the microstructure, thermal property and magnetic properties of mechanical alloyed FeSiBAlNi high entropy alloys (HEAs, base alloy) have been investigated in depth in the present work. The FeSiBAlNi (Co, Cu, Ag) amorphous HEAs have been successfully fabricated by mechanical alloying process. The results reveal that Co and Cu additions obviously shorten the formation time of fully amorphous phase, therefore, leading to enhanced glass forming ability of the base alloy. The final milling product of FeSiBAlNiAg consists of amorphous phase and nanocrystals with face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. In addition, Co addition obviously improves the thermal stability of the base alloy, while Cu and Ag additions present the detrimental effects. Moreover, the as-milled HEAs exhibit the semi-hard magnetic property. However, the saturation magnetization (Ms) values become decreased with element additions. It suggests that the coexistence of FCC and body-centered cubic (BCC) phase gives rise to a higher Ms than a single amorphous phase or mixture of amorphous and FCC phases. Additionally, the phase formation mechanisms of amorphous and solid solution phases, as well as the correlation between the microstructure and magnetic properties have been discussed, which can be beneficial to the design of novel alloy systems.",

Regardless of the cation concentration, spherical particles consisting of nano-order fine SSC and SDC crystallites were successfully obtained. Although the crystal size of all the synthesized powders was almost the same, the particle size increased with increasing cation concentration. The microstructure of the cathodes fabricated using the nano-composite powders clearly depended on the particle size of the starting powders; the microstructure became coarser with increasing particle size and the original particle shapes partially remained in the cathode network. Also, electrochemical measurements for solid oxide fuel cells with these cathodes revealed that the electrode performance was related to the microstructure. The electrode polarization resistance decreased with decreasing particle size, and a relatively fine microstructure cathode exhibited lower electrode polarization resistance, resulting in a high performance of 1.52\u00a0W\u00a0cm\u22122 at 700\u00a0\u00b0C.

The presence of both types of particles near the chimney region reduces, however, the strength of the central vortex and is detrimental for separation and segregation. Optimization of the solids inlet design is required, as illustrated by stopping the solids feeding.

The flexibility with respect to the gas flow rate of the bed density and uniformity and of the gas\u2013solids separation and segregation is demonstrated, a unique feature of vortex chamber generated rotating fluidized beds.

The model is firstly validated by the classic equations and reference data, and then extended to simulate the gas-phase polyethylene FBR under super-condensed mode for the first time. The influence of three important operating conditions (i.e., inlet gas velocity, inlet gas temperature, and condensable component isopentane concentration) on gas\u2013solid flow hydrodynamics is investigated to give qualitative and quantitative insights on how these factors affecting FBR performances (like bed expansion, bed temperature and productivity) under super-condensed mode through CFD approach. The simulation results demonstrate that with the increase of inlet gas velocity, the bed expansion increases rapidly and the number of particles at the lower portion of the bed reduces while raises at the higher position. The rise of the bed temperature is mainly contributed by the increased exothermic reaction rate as the inlet gas temperature increasing, which is also influenced by the concentration of condensable component isopentane. The simulation results show that bed temperature decreases with the increase of condensable isopentane concentration in gas stream. It is found that the method of heat removal through the latent heat of vaporization is extremely significant and can effectively increases reactor productivity without enlarging the size of the reactor under super-condensed mode.",

The nanocrystalline/nanosized powder is obtained after only 5\u00a0min of milling. A powder contamination with Fe occurs during milling and this leads to the formation of a w\u00fcstite-FeO phase. The formation of the FeO phase leads to the lattice strain release. The magnetisation decreases upon increasing the milling time due to the formation of the w\u00fcstite and structural disorder.",

     "abstract": "The effect of feed frame and paddle wheel design and operating conditions on particle flow is not fully understood. Performance optimization of the tablet press feed frames is an issue of great significance in the pharmaceutical industry. Inadequate die filling and the amount of shear-strain applied in the tablet compressing stage can result in losses of the finished product because of poor quality. Most feed frames have two or more compartments, which complicate the powder flow dynamics. Therefore, a feed frame was built based on a single paddle wheel to have a better understanding of the particle flow and the force exerted over the particles using discrete element method simulations. A factorial design was developed, which involves the paddle wheel speed, the number of paddles and the paddle height. Results showed that the faster the paddle wheel speed, the lower the relative standard deviation of the die weight. The number of paddles was also demonstrated to be an important factor on decreasing the die weight variability and affects the force exerted over the particles. These findings can lead to changes in feed frame design to avoid high die weight variability, reducing the undesired attrition and segregation effect improving tablet quality.",

The gas\u2013solid two-phase flow regularity for blasting heading face is the key scientific issue for dust control. In this paper, a real blasting heading face in China was taken as the physical model and a method coupling a direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) scheme with a CFD software was adopted to study the properties of dust particles (0.1\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) in the flow field of a roadway after blasting. The results show that dust group produced from the heading face is jetted into the roadway under the shock wave after blasting, and is diluted from its back-end to the front-end by the airflow from the pressing pipe arranged around the heading face, then dust concentration shows an overall gradual decrease, and finally the respirable dust particles exhibit an alternant thin dense phase distribution in the roadway, whereas other dust particles (>5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) spread at the bottom of the roadway and form dust retention. The dust concentration in the front-end of the roadway around the heading face is always higher than that in other zones due to the existence of vortex region. The respirable dust concentration is slightly greater than the standard of air quality in the beginning, and quickly reaches the standard. But the total dust concentration always does not meet the standard of air quality in general. The simulation results are also verified by the field data. The research results are helpful for providing more suitable guidance for the dust control.",

     "abstract": "A simple network model is derived for describing the transient response of a two-phase gravity-assisted heat-pipe at startup, steady, and shutdown states using AL2O3 nano-fluid. In order to obtain a stable suspension of 4% Al2O3 nano-fluid aluminum oxide particles are coated with polyethlene glycol (PEG), then dispersed in a 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) solution, and after that subjected to gamma irradiation at different doses. The heat pipe is divided into two heat carriers; evaporator and condenser. An energy balance for each carrier is carried out to estimate temperatures, heat transfer coefficients, thermal resistances, time constants, and other thermal characteristics at three different heat loads; 500, 1000, and 1500\u00a0W. Governing equations of the transient behavior can be simplified into first-order linear ordinary differential equations, which can be solved by the linear algebra formalism method yielding the heat-pipe temperatures. The transient response of a gravity-assisted heat pipe is found to depend mainly on the average evaporator thermal resistance. Increasing the heat loads causes a sharp reduction in the thermal resistance and in the time constants, which leads to better performance of the heat pipe. The evaporator and condenser heat transfer coefficients are thus found to increase with increasing power, so that at 500\u00a0W heat load the obtained evaporator heat transfer coefficient at steady state is approximately 100\u00a0W/m2\u00a0\u00b0C, while doubling the heat load causes he to increase to as much as 1100\u00a0W/m2\u00a0\u00b0C; i.e. more than 10 times the value attained with half that load. Increasing the heat load further to 1500\u00a0W gives about 3900\u00a0W/m2\u00a0\u00b0C; i.e. more than 3 times the value obtained with 1000\u00a0W. The variation in the corresponding values of the condenser heat transfer coefficients are much less than those obtained for the evaporator as they lie in the range of 1534\u20131557\u00a0W/m2\u00a0\u00b0C at heat loads 500 up to 1500\u00a0W. The effect of adding 4\u00a0vol.% AL2O3 nanoparticles to water is investigated by estimating the physical properties of the nanofluid at steady state for the three investigated input powers and comparing them with those of water. The most important feature of them is the thermal conductivity, which is found to increase by 27% above that of water. The dynamic viscosity of the 4\u00a0vol.% AL2O3 nano-fluid is found to increase by 10% over all selected powers. The replacement of ordinary cooling fluid with nano-fluid has thus no noticeable effect on the flow dynamics but it considerably enhances the heat transfer properties.",

The impurity uptake and speciation were found to be a strong function of the operating conditions, including the choice of the plasma gas and the Cu feedstock. The operating conditions were identified under which the oxidation of the product nanopowder was minimized upon exposure to ambient laboratory environment.

Analysis for both single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) is presented and compared. Water and kerosene oil are employed as the ordinary (or base) fluids. Mathematical modeling and analysis are attended in the presence of porous medium, melting heat transfer and homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. Diffusion coefficients for autocatalyst and reactant are treated similar. Series solutions of the governing nonlinear modeled problems have been constructed by using optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM). This method is very efficient for development of series solutions of highly nonlinear differential equations. Computations for residual errors are prepared. Comparison of present study with the previous published work is also made. The velocity, temperature, concentration, skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number are discussed for different influential variables entering into the problems statements. The flow decreases for higher values of variable thickness parameter when m < 1 and it enhances when m > 1 . Higher velocity profile is observed for volume fraction parameter in case of kerosene oil carbon nanotubes when compared with the water carbon nanotubes. The skin friction can be reduced by increasing ratio parameter and it advances by increasing volume fraction parameter. It is observed that MWCNTs has maximum heat transfer and minimum thermal resistance due to low density of MWCNTs when compared with SWNTs for water. The flow accelerates in case of MWCNTs than SWNTs for both base fluids namely water and kerosene oil. Comparison for the results of SWNTs and MWNTs is highlighted. Homogeneous reaction parameter corresponds to decrease in the concentration distribution and opposite behavior is observed for heterogeneous reaction parameter. Such consideration may play a vital role in industrial process as a cooling agent.",

The coal particles in a cylindrical column (inner diameter\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0mm and bed height\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0mm) were fluidized at a given air velocity u0/umf\u00a0=\u00a01.3\u20133.0 for thirty minutes where u0 and umf are the superficial air velocity and the minimum fluidization air velocity, respectively. The bulk density of the coal particles in each layer 10\u00a0mm in height (ten layers in total) was measured after the fluidization to investigate the segregation. It was found that the maximum segregation is produced at u0/umf\u00a0=\u00a02.0; the segregation is less pronounced at smaller and larger air velocities investigated. The origin of the dependence of the segregation on the air velocity is related to the velocity relative to the minimum fluidization velocity, the size of the air bubbles moving up through the fluidized bed, particle movement and vertical mixing. The calorific value and ash content of the ten layers before and after the segregation were estimated by fitting the dependence of calorific value and ash content on the bulk density. If the top 7 layers after segregation are regarded as the product (70% yield), the calorific value is increased from 5063\u00a0kcal/kg to 6067\u00a0kcal/kg and the ash content is decreased from 34.0\u00a0wt% to 22.4\u00a0wt% at u0/umf\u00a0=\u00a02.0, indicating that fine coal can be upgraded by the dry separation. The combustible recovery and ash reduction resulting from the segregation indicate that the upgrade is mainly caused by rejecting ash into the lower 8th to 10th layers.",

An analysis of a large volume of high quality batch grinding data available in the literature has shown that this approach suffers from several drawbacks. For this reason, the values of the specific breakage rate parameter, k1, reported by the researchers are found to be not sufficiently accurate for mill scale-up and design work. The present paper discusses the rationale behind a new approach proposed. It involves carrying out only one short duration batch grinding experiment using a feed charge that has been pre-ground for sufficient time under the same mill operating conditions for which the value of k1 is to be determined. The results of experiments carried out using two types of cement clinker and quartz are presented for several different combinations of the mill operating parameters.

     "abstract": "Inception of the second drying stage called locking point plays a crucial role in the microencapsulation process of functional oils by spray drying. The transition between the first and the second drying periods can directly affect encapsulation efficiency and lipid oxidation by modifying the mechanism of globules migration to the surface of droplet/particles. In this study, the locking point of a single emulsion droplet prepared by incorporating walnut oil into skim milk powder solution was determined using a droplet suspension device. The effects of drying air temperature (80\u2013140\u00a0\u00b0C), total solid content (12\u201333% w/w), and oil/wall material mass fraction (0.25\u20131.00\u00a0w/w) were assessed on the droplet/particle drying behavior, shrinkage, and locking point. The latter was achieved by plotting the variation of drying rate against moisture content of the droplet/particle. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was applied in order to investigate the morphology of the produced particles. Finally, a regression function for estimating the locking point from experimental variables was developed. Overall, such research can pave the way towards increasing the encapsulation efficiency and mitigating the lipid oxidation in industrial-scale spray dryers applied for microencapsulation of functional oils.",

     "abstract": "The discrete element method (DEM) is an effective computational technique that is used to investigate the mechanical behavior of various particle systems like, for example, agglomerates. However, for systems of perfectly spherical and non-overlapping particles, the structural input is almost always based only qualitatively on experimentally observed structures. In this paper, we consider the case of agglomerates where particles are nearly spherical and connected by bonds. A novel bonded-particle extraction (BPE) method is proposed for the automated approximation of such agglomerate structures from tomographic data sets. This method can be effectively used in conjunction with various commercial or open-source DEM simulation systems. By BPE, sphere-like primary particles are represented each by exactly one (perfect) sphere, and the set of spheres is non-overlapping. Furthermore, the solid bridge bonds between primary particles are retained. Having derived such a simple description of complex tomographic data sets, one can perform DEM simulations with well-established models like the bonded-particle model. Moreover, it is shown that a larger data base of statistically equivalent microstructures can be generated by a stochastic modeling approach. This approach reduces the need for (time-consuming) experimental agglomerate production and characterization.",

Evaluation of material tensile characteristics are often destructive and costly and impossible for small samples. Therefore, instrumented indentation tests can be employed to obtain the tensile stress-strain curve of the material. In this investigation, the tensile stress-strain curve of Al7075-SiC nanocomposite is obtained using combination of spherical indentation test, finite element (FE) simulation, and neural networks. To fabricate the Al7075/SiC nanocomposite samples, Al7075 micron-sized powder and SiC nano particles were mixed to obtain Al7075-5\u00a0vol% SiC, and Al7075-10\u00a0vol% SiC and the mixtures were mechanically milled. The mixtures were then consolidated under impact loading by a single-stage gas gun. The compaction was performed at 573\u00a0K temperature and a maximum relative density of 97.5% was obtained. The load-penetration curve for each nanocomposite sample was obtained using spherical indentation test on the compacted samples. The corresponding numerical curve for each sample was also obtained by finite element simulation of the indentation process. Finally, using the experimental and the FE results, the constants of Hollomon\u2019s material model were determined using artificial neural networks (ANN). The results indicated that SiC nano-particles reinforcement of Al7075 increased the tensile strength of the nanocomposite by around 300%.",

Stereological bias is believed to be affected by the particle texture, i.e., the stereological bias of a simple locking particle is high, while the bias of a particle with a complex texture is negligible. However, scant work has been performed on the development of a quantitative and versatile modeling of stereological bias. We performed a series of numerical simulations: modeling particle assembly using the discrete element method; modeling the binary texture of particles by imposing phase patterns to the particles; systematical generation of 8608 types of phase patterns; liberation assessments in 2D and in three-dimension (3D) based on the error-free geometrical calculation; and stereological bias assessment by a comparison between liberations in 2D and 3D. Through these simulations, the correlation between the stereological biases of the phases and particle texture was investigated. Finally, the particle texture complexity was assessed using the fractal dimension of image intensity, and stereological bias for the matrix phase was successfully correlated with the fractal dimension and area fraction of the core phase. Fractal dimension and area fraction values are easily obtained by 2D measurements and subsequent image analysis. These results may lead to the establishment of a versatile stereological correction model that depends only on measurable 2D parameters.",

     "abstract": "Since 1976, grain boundary engineering (GBE) has been used to improve the properties of a material (e.g., strength and corrosion resistance in polycrystalline materials). The concept of GBE is to produce a high population of special grain boundaries (coincidence-site lattice grain boundaries, CSL GBs) with certain misorientations to replace general GBs with a random misorientation. Previous studies have demonstrated that special GBs exhibit superior properties of low defect, and this promotes the strength and corrosion and oxidation resistance of materials. Compared with metals, only few studies have reported on the application of GBE to ceramics. The main problem is that ceramics are too brittle to undergo a thermomechanical process (conventional GBE process of metals) to orientate grains for special GBs. To the best of our knowledge, only 3% (near the random distribution of 1.5%) of \u03a33 GBs, one of the common CSL GBs, has been reported for polycrystalline strontium titanate (SrTiO3). We suggested that a high population of approximately 9% \u03a33 GBs can be achieved in polycrystalline SrTiO3 by controlling the shapes and surface planes of nanocyrstals in SrTiO3 (initial powder).

In the UV\u2013vis spectrum characterizations, STDSHPs showed significant light harvesting capability in both UV- and visible-light range. STDSHPs also showed stronger per-weight UV absorbance capability than solid TiO2 particles and commercial TiO2 photocatalyst P25, which could be attributed to their novel hollow structure\u2014and thus the absence of light-inaccessible TiO2 particles. Moreover, we analyzed the narrowed band-gap of STDSHPs by the Brus\u2019 effective-mass model (EMM).",

The loading of coupling agents on the silica surface is positively correlated with the amount of coupling agent added. However, if this amount exceeds the single-layer adsorption calculated from the minimum coverage area of the silane-coupling agent, the extent of modification decreases. Additionally, the extent of modification tended to decrease as the coupling reaction temperature increased (40\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C). Repulsive force was observed for GPTMS-modified silica in water and MPTMS- and VTMS-modified silica in toluene. In contrast, clear repulsion was not observed for GPTMS in toluene and MPTMS- and VTMS-modified silica in water. With GPTMS-modified silica in water and VTMS-modified silica in toluene, the repulsive forces increase with the extent of modification, resulting in good dispersibility. Conversely, for VTMS-modified silica in water and GPTMS-modified silica in toluene, weakly repulsive and attractive forces were observed independent of the extent of modification, and flocculation and sedimentation were noted when the actual dispersibility was examined. These results indicate that the actual dispersibility can be evaluated from the surface interaction forces.",

The hydrophilic Ti particles, on the other hand, were designed to \u201cstay\u201d between the ZrO2-stabilized bubbles to form struts of the foam together with the ZrO2 particles not attached at the interface. Composite foams of binary particulate mixtures were then shaped into desired geometries by freeze gelcasting in which addition of agar was used as the shape-setting agent to avoid phase segregation due to the density and wettability difference.

Here we report on a rapid solvothermal synthesis (200\u00a0\u00b0C, 2\u00a0h) of either PEG or PVP capped NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ particles.

Both polymers proved to be a good structure directing agents enabling generation of the well crystalline polymer coated up-converting particles with efficient emissions in visible spectrum. It was shown that generation of the hexagonal P63/m \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ phase with the most efficient green emission (CIE 0.31, 0.66) is enhanced when PVP is used during synthesis, while promotion of the cubic Fm-3m \u03b1-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ phase that has a yellowish spectral output (CIE 0.41, 0.56) was observed in the particles produced in the presence of PEG.

The mesoporous silica spheres and rod-like silica (SBA-15) particles were selected as hard templates and also served as reactants. Highly active mesoporous silica is reacted through a combination of sucrose-nano-casting and carbothermal reduction nitridation (CRN) to successfully synthesize spherical and rod-like powders. Temperature and holding time of calcination are found to be significant factors for the formation of pure and well-crystallized powders. Insufficient temperature and holding time cause an incomplete reaction between silica, carbon and nitrogen, and also lead to the formation of amorphous phase. In the processing, sucrose was used as carbon source to incorporate evenly into mesopores of templates to assist CRN reaction. Big surface areas and high porosity of mesopores in SiO2 provide an additional driving force to decrease the formation temperature of Si2N2O phase to 1280\u00a0\u00b0C. As-synthesized powders inherit same morphology as their parental mesoporous templates, which indicate that two mesoporous templates play an important role in guiding the growth of ceramic particles.

In both of the experiment and the DEM simulation, mixing behavior of alumina (3600\u00a0kg/m3) and stainless steel (7930\u00a0kg/m3) particles in the rotating drum was observed and mixing degree was evaluated. In the experiment, most of the alumina particles with lower density exist close to the container wall and in the vicinity of the surface of particle bed. The mixing behavior of DEM simulation is comparatively similar to that of the experiment, and it is confirmed that the DEM simulation has high reliability for simulating the mixing behavior. The DEM simulation was used to analyze the influence of particle density on mixing behavior and to make clear the segregation mechanism in a binary system. When the particle density ratio is larger, the mixing behavior in a rotating drum is strongly affected by the ratio. In order to analyze the mechanism of the segregation quantitatively, the new index related with the mobility of particles was developed. This result of the index indicated that the particles with lower density could move easily in comparison with higher density particles, and the difference between the mobility of those materials cause the segregation. The rotating drum with lifters (RDM_L) was adopted to improve the mixing state of particles, and particles behavior in the drum was simulated by the DEM. The mixing state of particles becomes comparatively uniform and the particle segregation would not be observed. These results indicate that lifters could control the behavior of higher and lower density particles and enhance particles mixing.",

Large scorodite particles (>10\u00a0\u03bcm) were successfully synthesized using ultrasound irradiation. The particle morphology was related to the ultrasound intensity, with the particles synthesized with low intensity showing rough surfaces and those with high intensity showing faceted surface. The higher ultrasound intensity generated a larger amount of fine oxygen bubbles during ultrasound irradiation under O2 gas flow. This increased the area of the interface between the gas phase (oxygen bubbles) and the liquid phase [Fe(II) solution] and promoted the oxidation. Additionally, ultrasound enhanced the transfer of the solutes [Fe(III), As(V)] from the solution to the nuclei with the jet flow by collapsing of the bubbles and the physical stirring by ultrasound irradiation.

     "abstract": "A nanocomposite of hydroxyapatite (HAP)\u2013carbon nanotube (CNT) was synthesized by in-situ transformation of CNT-calcium phenyl phosphate (CaPP) with the assist of alkaline phosphatase. The nanocomposite was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Then the HAP\u2013CNT was cast onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and used as a sensing platform for the electrochemical determination of luteolin. The electrochemical experiments indicated that the HAP\u2013CNT modified GCE (HAP\u2013CNT/GCE) could greatly enhance the electrochemical response of luteolin. A series of experimental parameters including the type and pH value of supporting electrolyte, accumulation time and accumulation potential were optimized. The electrochemical parameters such as electron transfer rate constant and electron transfer coefficient of luteolin at the HAP\u2013CNT/GCE were also investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the reduction peak currents presented a good linear relationship with the concentration of luteolin in the range of 4.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u20131.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0M.

These metastable alumina phases were confirmed by comparing with X-ray diffraction patterns of the thermally treated gibbsite (\u03b3-Al(OH)3). Eventually, the milling of boehmite resulted in the formation of thermodynamically stable \u03b1-Al2O3. Although boehmite is normally decomposed into \u03b3-Al2O3 by heating, the phase transformation route of boehmite induced by mechanical milling differed from that induced by thermal process.

To estimate stress distribution in a compact during CIP, an ordinary differential equation for radial displacement is formulated when Young\u2019s modulus is given as a function of radial coordinate. By solving the differential equation numerically, the stress distribution is actually estimated. Based on fracture location theory combined with the stress distribution, the joint probability density function of granule collapse and also its related functions are derived as functions of radial coordinate and applied CIP pressure. A numerical simulation is carried out for a given parameters, and it is shown that the collapse probability of granules is gradually increased with the CIP pressure and also becomes higher at the surface than inside the powder compact after CIP.",

Green SiC\u2013carbon (C) substrate is first formed via a newly developed gelcasting method, using an organic-solvent-based slurry comprised of submicron SiC and nanometer C powders, along with a flexible and thermosetting polyurethane resin, based on the replica method with polyurethane foam as a template. Subsequently, the flexible semi-wet green substrate is uniaxially compressed under heating for molding to a set thickness; this is possible because of its thermosetting property (heat press molding). Although the slurry viscosity is highly sensitive to fine fluctuations in the powder volume concentration (PVC; 0.45\u20130.48), the PVC criterion for homogeneous powder solidification and improvement in the green SiC\u2013C strut quality is determined to be 0.46. At 0.48 PVC, it is confirmed that the formed green SiC\u2013C struts reproduce the template morphologically with a high correlation coefficient of 0.96 for the average strut thickness. As regards the open-celled sintered Si-SiC substrate (thickness: 6\u00a0mm), the Si-SiC strut appears to be skeletal with a triangular vertical cross-section, which can be successfully warped or twisted without cracking; furthermore, the mechanical strength is evidently improved via the heat press molding.",

     "abstract": "This study finds that doping tin mono-sulfide (SnS) with different concentrations of manganese (Mn) (0\u201330wt%) results in a competition for anion bonding between tin and manganese during the hot-injection synthesis of the nanoparticles, creating lattice structures with strained crystallites and hence favoring the formation of the metastable zinc blende phase that has the crystal structure of sphalerite, a zinc ore. A typical hot-inject process was used to synthesize the SnS nanoparticles using oleic acid and oleylamine as solvents to produce the tin (doped with manganese) and sulfur precursors, respectively. We obtained a purely zinc blende phase at 260\u00a0\u00b0C when the doping concentration of Mn was increased to 30% while the stable orthorhombic phase was synthesized without doping. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) and Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) results confirm the presence of the zinc blende phase at 30% Mn doping concentration. Ultraviolet\u2013Vis\u2013Near Infrared (UV\u2013Vis\u2013NIR) spectra show absorption onset at 980\u00a0nm for the orthorhombic phase and 840\u00a0nm for the zinc blende phase, and this blue shift can be attributed to the change in crystal phase structure. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) data shows that Mn2+ is doped substitutionally in place of Sn2+, while the strong presence of Sn4+ is due to the low enthalpy during the formation of tin vacancies. Doped SnS thin films without any catalysts were spin-coated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and used as a working electrode in a photo-electrochemical cell and show photocurrent densities up to 53.26\u00a0\u03bcA/cm2 at an applied potential of \u22121\u00a0V.

Amino acid addition into an ethanol aqueous solution containing tranilast triggered the change in pH. Different amino acids affected tranilast formation in solution before spray drying. Consequently, the particle morphology of spray-dried tranilast changed. We investigated the crystal form of tranilast in SDPs using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. PXRD pattern of tranilast SDPs with histidine was a typical broad amorphous band. Tranilast SDPs with leucine had a characteristic leucine crystalline peak, while the PXRD pattern of tranilast SDPs with aspartic acid had characteristic crystalline peaks associated with a stable crystal form of tranilast. On performing fluorescence analysis, the crystal form of tranilast with aspartic acid showed little or no change. The emission spectrum of tranilast in SDPs with histidine or leucine showed a blue shift compared with that of untreated tranilast crystals, indicating that histidine or leucine may induce the crystal transition of tranilast.

     "abstract": "Liquid phase sintering is used for the consolidation of powder based materials to enhance densification by the activation of diffusion rates and sintering kinetics. However, an inappropriate interaction between the liquid and the solid powdered skeleton can promote excessive swelling instead of densification, and the purpose of the liquid phase process would not be fulfilled. In the Powder Metallurgy (PM) industry, Cu is among the main alloying elements used in the production of low alloyed sintered steels. Cu promotes the formation of transient liquid below the common sintering temperatures (1120\u00a0\u00b0C). Although it favors rapid homogenization and can be used to effectively transport other alloying elements, it causes a significant swelling effect upon melting that needs to be controlled in order to maintain a proper dimensional stability. The dimensional expansion associated to Cu melting and its distribution in a Fe-base system has been mainly treated in the literature on the basis of dilatometry studies. A systematic study of the influence of different sintering parameters has never been included in that discussion and the information in the literature about the wetting behavior of liquid Cu or Cu alloys is scarce.

A rotational speed of 1400\u00a0rpm, liquid flow rates of 0.6\u00a0L/min, and a temperature of 21\u00a0\u00b0C were used. nZVI that was prepared in this way had a mean grain size of 11.5\u00a0nm and a BET surface area of 17.1\u00a0m2/g.

At pH 4 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C with an nZVI dosage of 0.30\u00a0g/L, the prepared nZVI degraded approximately 92% of the RR2 in 5\u00a0min; this efficiency of degradation greatly exceeded that obtained using nZVI that was purchased from Centron Biochemistry Technology (CBT).",

It is indicated that the heterojunction between g-C3N4 and TiO2 formed and the TiO2 nanoparticles well dispersed on g-C3N4 sheets. Among as synthesized hybrid photocatalysts, the g-C3N4/TiO2-80% sample exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation using methylene blue as the target pollutant. Compared with pure g-C3N4 and TiO2, the g-C3N4/TiO2-80% hybrid photocatalyst exhibited enhanced visible-light photoactivity, which is around 3.5 times as high as that of the pure g-C3N4. The enhancement of the g-C3N4/TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts can be attributed to the relatively higher adsorption capacity and effective separation of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs.

SEM results revealed that with increase in the molar concentration of the capping agent CuO nanopowder tends to become more homogeneous and thus well prevented the agglomeration of the nanoparticles. Also the particle size was observed to decline with increasing capping agent concentration. Band gap calculations made employing the Tauc\u2019s plot method indicate a consistent increase in the band gap with increase in concentration of capping agent corresponding to the reduction in particle size. The impact of the capping agent on the vibration pattern of CuO nanoparticles is evident from the FTIR spectra. The photoconductivity of the CuO nanoparticles showed a decrease in the dark and photo current values with the increase in molar concentration of the capping agent which could be attributed to the increase in the optical band gap. Thus the particle size and hence the band gap of nanoparticles could be tuned effectively by altering the concentration of the capping agent.",

This paper presents an efficient method for enhancing the ex situ carbonation of dunites. The ball milling process was applied to a dunite from the Troodos ophiolite (Cyprus), in order to create a new type of material with enhanced CO2 uptake. Through CO2 chemisorption followed by temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) experiments, optimum ball milling conditions were found (12\u00a0h of wet ball milling with 50\u00a0wt% ethanol as process control agent), leading to an increase of CO2 uptake of dunite by a factor of 6.9. A further increase of CO2 uptake by 10% was accomplished after 4\u00a0h of additional ball milling with smaller balls. Additionally, CO2-TPD along with in situ DRIFTS studies indicated that the CO2 uptake of the dunitic materials can be substantially enhanced by the presence of H2O during CO2 chemisorption. The positive effect of H2O on CO2 chemisorption becomes much more evident after the ball milling process. Specifically, the CO2 uptake of the ball-milled sample (BM45) was enhanced by a factor of 5.8 (from 181.9 to 1047.5\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0g\u22121), when CO2 chemisorption was performed in the presence of 20\u00a0vol% H2O.",

Magnetic measurements revealed a higher saturation magnetisation in the case of the amorphous alloy containing titanium than for the reference amorphous alloy.

One of the studied concepts is the application of nanofluids characterized by enhanced thermal properties, e.g. improved thermal conductivity or overall heat transfer coefficient. In this work a simple synthesis method of temperature responsive CuO\u2013water colloidal system is presented. In the experiments a two step synthesis method was employed and several different copolymers of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) were used as stabilization agents. The main efforts of the research were focused on the obtaining of colloidal system which stability would suddenly collapse at desired chosen temperature. Additionally, such transition should be reversible. The synthesized samples were characterized by particle size distribution analysis, zeta potential, absorbance and thermal conductivity. It was proved that it is possible to achieve the chosen goal using appropriate combination of ultrasonication, polymer adsorption and the change of ionic strength of the mother liquid.",

In view of this case, an equivalent hydrodynamic diameter, defined as the effective settlement diameter, has been proposed from force balance for particles settling in non-Newtonian fluids, and an iterative calculation procedure was presented. In the present work, proppant effective settlement diameters falling in non-Newtonian fracturing fluids were studied. Settling velocities of three kinds of proppants falling in glycerol solutions, uncross-linked guar solutions and slick-waters were measured, numerous random repeated experiments were conducted, the corresponding proppant effective settlement diameters were calculated and the relationships between proppant effective settlement diameter and their sieve diameter falling in different fluids were studied. Results indicate that the proppant effective settlement diameter falling in uncross-linked guar solutions is bigger than that in glycerol, while it is smaller for slick-waters. When proppants settle in glycerol solutions, the proppants effective settling diameters are constantly 1.24 times bigger than their corresponding sieve diameter. For proppants settling in uncross-linked guar solutions and slick-waters respectively, two sigmoid curves of diameter ratio are obtained followed by reaching an asymptotic value, 1. This work presented a new calculation procedure of equivalent hydrodynamic diameter for non-spherical particles settling in non-Newtonian fluids. The effective settlement diameter extends the application conditions of Stokes diameter to non-Newtonian fluids and can be used in wider engineering applications.",

     "abstract": "Pseudo-2D fluidized beds have been crucial for the understanding of the dynamics of gas-particle systems. In these systems the distance between the front and back walls is narrow, which restricts and creates a resistance to the solids motion, leading to a different flow behaviour compared to fully 3D systems. This interaction of the particle motion with the walls can be significant and should not be neglected in numerical simulations. The present work develops a new model to easily account for the friction effect between the walls and the particles in a pseudo-2D bed. The model is based on experimental results combined with simplifications of the shear force on a wall provided by the kinetic theory of granular flows. The dependence on the particle diameter and bed thickness is directly introduced in the model through the use of a straightforward expression that is easy to code and does not lead to numerical divergence. To test the model two beds of different thickness were simulated, and the resulting time-averaged solids concentration and velocity as well as bubble properties were compared with experiments. It is shown that the numerical results with the new wall-friction model improve the prediction of the standard 2D-simulations.",

     "abstract": "Mixing of particles in a rotating drum mixer with filling level greater than 50% has been analysed using Discrete Element Method (DEM). An attempt has been made to understand the mechanism of the dead zone formation and the degree of mixing by varying the mixing parameters. These include the size and packing of particles, speed and shape of the mixer, etc. While the formation of the dead zone is qualitatively analysed, the degree of mixing has been quantified with a suitable mixing index (\u03c8). It is found that packing arrangement and particle size significantly affect the formation of the dead zone, whereas, the drum speed and geometry has a relatively lesser effect. The effect of various parameters on the dead zone formation is explained on the basis of variation in energy distribution pattern from the wall towards the centre of the mixer. It has been found that the energy required for agitating the particles is transferred from the outer wall to the centre of the mixer. In the process of transfer, a significant amount of energy is expended before reaching the centre, which allows a compacted dead zone to form around the centre. A preliminary attempt has been also made to study mixing in a drum with baffles. The baffles act as the medium of efficient energy transfer by imparting their energy to the particles that come in contact with them thereby resulting in better mixing.",

In this reaction, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were used as precursor of silica and HCl as a catalyst, and it has been found that acidic catalyst plays an important role to form amorphous silica layer on nanoparticle surface without formation any core-free silica particles. The composition, morphology and structure of the products were characterized using different analysis technique such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), electrophoretic scattering photometer, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively.

The experimental kinetic data were well fitted by the pseudo-second order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity up to 137\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121. The selectivity for lead ions was examined as well in the presence of cadmium ions. The mechanism of lead removal by the modified carbon was also studied.",

In this work, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology was applied to simulate the filtration performance of multi\u2013fiber filters. The pressure drop and filtration efficiency with different fiber arrangements, fiber diameters, face velocities and particle sizes were studied. It was found that filtration efficiency changed with the face velocity for different particle sizes. The layered structures with the same fiber diameters and total solid volume fraction (SVF) were compared, indicating that the dense\u2013sparse structure had the highest filtration efficiency for all the simulated particle sizes at the cost of high pressure drop. Then the dense\u2013sparse structure was optimized to achieve a better filtration performance by using less tiny fibers in the front\u2013row and removing some fibers in the back\u2013row.",

     "abstract": "The handling of wet particles in chemical engineering is often difficult because cohesive forces acting on wet particles cause particulate aggregation and the adherence of devices, unlike what occurs under a dry condition. The liquid-bridge force is introduced to the discrete element method in the investigation of the behavior of wet particles. However, existing numerical modeling has problems from the viewpoint of the effect of cohesion in contact states. Specifically, the cohesive force is treated as a constant value for contact states. This means the effect of the cohesive force is not only dependent on the spring constant in the discrete element simulation but is also frequently overestimated. To solve this problem, the present study developed a numerical contact model considering quantitatively the effect of the cohesive force in contact states and validated the model for a pan pelletizer. The behaviors and cascading angles of wet particles in simulation and experiments were in good agreement and the validity of the contact model was thus demonstrated. The present numerical contact model is thus a promising model for the numerical simulation of wet particles.",

The inside walls are at a constant cold temperature. The right walls are adiabatic, where the other walls of cavity are heated with a constant heat flux. The results are based on the cooling optimization of heat walls using nanofluid under the magnetic field for inclination angles from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. The governing equations are solved using finite volume formulation and the SIMPLE algorithm is used for pressure\u2013velocity coupling. The obtained results indicate that the influence of nanofluid on the average Nusselt number (Nuav) decreases by increasing Hartmann number (Ha). The Nuav decreases by increasing nanoparticles volume fraction up to Ha of 60 at Ra\u00a0=\u00a0105. The effect of solid volume fraction can be neglected at Ha greater than 60. The results demonstrated that the increase in cavity aspect ratio (AR), nanoparticles volume fraction and inclination angle (\u03b1) values resulted in increasing of Nuav. The influence of \u03b1 on the heat transfer decreases by enhancement in AR. The nanofluid does not significantly affect the heat transfer by increasing \u03b1 values.

The effects of parameters such as Reynolds number, particle size, wall heat flux, and particle concentration on entropy generation rates are investigated. By increasing the Reynolds number and the concentration and by reducing the particle size, the convective heat transfer coefficient enhances. The thermal entropy generation rate decreases when the concentration and the Reynolds number are increased, while it increases when the heat flux and the particle size are increased. However, the frictional entropy generation incorporates a trend which is totally in contrast with the thermal entropy generation. The effect of Reynolds number change on the frictional entropy generation rate is more significant than that of concentration. At higher Reynolds numbers, changing of the concentration alters the frictional entropy generation rate more significantly. By changing the particle size, the total entropy generation rate incorporates a minimum value (i.e. optimum value). The Bejan number has large values near the walls, and the effect of changing the particle size on the Bejan number is more noticeable at the greater concentrations. In addition, at the cross sections near the inlet, the Bejan number is negligible in large parts of central regions of the channel, and increases along the channel length. Based on the data obtained, the model of entropy generation rates was developed in terms of effective parameters using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).",

Experimental particle velocity distributions were determined by means of a high-speed video camera in order to validate the model in a scaled-up rotary drum. The drum length effect on the particle dynamics was also analyzed. It was observed that, besides the model parameter values, the particle shape plays an important role in particle motion and DEM granular flow prediction. The drum geometry also exhibited a major and nontrivial influence on particle dynamics since the greater the distance between front and back wall, the lower the dynamic angle of repose and the lower the particle velocity values in the active region.",

XRD patterns and M\u00f6ssbauer spectra show that the amorphous components in the FexB100\u2212x nanostructures increase as the boron content are improved. Magnetic properties reveal that the saturation magnetization and coercivity of the samples strongly depend on the boron contents, and the amorphous one performs lower coercivity and remarkable soft magnetic behavior. The high-frequency electromagnetic characteristics of the representative crystalline and amorphous FexB100\u2212x nanomaterials were investigated. In comparison with the crystallized FexB100\u2212x nanostructures, the amorphous sample displays improved complex permeability and reduced complex permittivity, which is mainly originated from the lower anisotropy field and high resistivity of the amorphous phase. The microwave absorption properties show that the amorphous sample has a maximum reflection loss of \u221239.4\u00a0dB at 4.2\u00a0GHz with a matching thickness of only 2.0\u00a0mm. Compared with the crystallized one, the amorphous sample shows a dramatic enhancement of microwave absorption properties, which is mainly due to that its relatively high permeability and low permittivity are beneficial for the impedance matching.

Moreover, the increase in reaction time during isothermal hydrolization offers a more uniform coating and thus enhanced physical, structural and thermal properties.

Cinnamyl alcohol and cinnamoyl chloride are well known for their photo-dimerization reactions. By introducing them on the fumed silica surface, it is possible to create a functional silica which can be aggregated by cross-linking under optical irradiation. For surface modification of the fumed silica, an autoclave method was used with the cinnamyl alcohol, while the reflux method was used for the cinnamoyl chloride. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), a thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and the Bruneuer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) method were used to evaluate the surface structure of the modified silica. In the case of modification with cinnamyl alcohol, the maximum amount of the modifier groups was 1.7-OR/nm2, and the modification degree could be controlled by varying the initial concentration of the modifier in the reaction. On the other hand, the maximum amount of the modifier groups was 0.33-OR/nm2 with cinnamoyl chloride, but it could be increased to 0.69-OR/nm2 when pyridine was used as the catalyst during the modification. The reaction process was evaluated by the MOPAC simulation, and the ultraviolet (UV) absorption based on the structure was calculated by ZINDO.

The attrition rates of VPP and FCC at an orifice gas velocity of 180\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 were 5\u00a0mg\u00a0h\u22121 and 7\u00a0mg\u00a0h\u22121, respectively; it was 10\u00a0mg\u00a0h\u22121 for powders with a mass fraction of 50\u00a0% CuO 40\u00a0% CaO and 10\u00a0% cement.

The (CaO)40(CuO)50cem10 attrition resistance improved above 500\u00a0\u00b0C and the d50 of the pellets remaining in the jet cup increased from 330\u00a0\u03bcm to 422\u00a0\u03bcm: the Cu agglomerated the pellets. Attrition rates increased with the square of the orifice diameter, the cube of the gas velocity and to the power 0.4 with gas molecular weight.",

Thus, controlling Na2ZrSiO5 formation is necessary. In this paper, we studied the effects of roasting temperature, NaOH/zircon mole ratio, and particle size of zircon sand on Na2ZrSiO5 formation. The optimum reaction parameters, when the roasting time was 1\u00a0h, were as follows: \u2a7e95\u00a0\u03bcm average particle size of zircon sand, 6:1 NaOH/zircon mole ratio, and 750\u00a0\u00b0C roasting temperature. To avoid an uneven roasting temperature during alkali fusion, the use of a rotary kiln reactor is recommended. The amount of Na2ZrSiO5 was significantly decreased under these optimum conditions, and the content of Na2O was reduced from 7.049% to only 2.21% after three water-leaching cycles.",

     "abstract": "The void fraction of computational cells in numerical simulations of particulate flows using computational fluid dynamics\u2013discrete element method (CFD\u2013DEM) is often directly (or crudely) calculated assuming that the entire body of a particle lies in the cell at which the particle centroid resides. This direct method is most inexpensive but inaccurate and may lead to simulation instabilities. In this study, a modified version of the direct method has been proposed. In this method, referred to as the particle meshing method (PMM), the particle is meshed and the solid volume in a fluid cell is calculated by adding up the particle mesh volume with the basic working principle being the same as that of the direct method. As a result, the PMM inherits the simplicity and hence the computational advantage from the direct method, whilst allowing for duplicating the particle shape and accurate accounting of particle volume in each fluid cell. The numerical simulation characteristics of PMM including numerical stability, minimum particle grid number, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency have been examined. The results showed that for a specific cell-to-particle size ratio, there was a minimum particle grid number required to reach the stable simulation. A formula of estimating the minimum particle grid number was derived and discussed. Typically, a particle grid number of about 5 times the minimum number was suggested to achieve the best computational efficiency, which was comparable or even higher than that of simulations using the analytical approach. PMM also exhibited the potential to be applied for complex computational domain geometries and irregular shaped particles.",

Based on the analysis of commercial formulations, a simple formulation based on the top most common components (silica, water and VP/VA copolymer) was used to create liquid marbles and investigate the role of the formulation ingredients on liquid marble stability. The inclusion of 2% and 5% VP/VA as film former extended the survival time of the liquid marbles but this was still well short of the commercial formulations.

The straight prolongation of the main pipe is called the main while the other side of the junction is the branch with different angles and orientations. Under extreme cases of fluid flow split, vortices form at the entrance of the main and alter the trend of solids split remarkably.

Optimization was achieved by first fixing the SBA-15 content in the CPE based on detection of hydrogen peroxide, an intermediate formed during oxidation of glucose by GOD. Subsequent glucose sensing measurements necessitated addition of ferrocene to improve sensitivity. This sensor gave a very high linear sensing-range of glucose (2.0\u201318.2\u00a0mM) from the hypo- to hyperglycemic range, a high sensitivity (1.5\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0cm\u22122\u00a0mM\u22121), a fast response time (<5\u00a0s), a good storage stability (of at least 8\u00a0days), without any loss in sensitivity. The sensor is also selective against interfering species such as urea and dopamine, but not against uric acid and ascorbic acid. A large mesopore diameter (11.4\u00a0nm) of the SBA-15 particles ensured GOD molecule was well impregnated, translating into a superior linear range and storage stability. Simultaneously, the high specific surface area of SBA-15 (406\u00a0m2/g) resulted in a large contact area between carbon and SBA-15 particles, leading to increased inter-particle connectivity. The latter, together with ferrocene, resulted in increased sensitivity.",

This approach yields an immediate evaluation for the capillary interaction that eliminates the necessity of capturing the complex process of contact line formation.

The transition to an assembled array is found to be slower with increases in particle size, but only small differences are observed in the final structures.

The obtained Ni doped LAO was perovskite mono-phase. The specific surface area and the reduction degree of the obtained catalyst was controlled by control the reduction conditions. As a result, almost the all Ni component near the surface was reduced by H2 reduction process even in the case of low H2 reduction temperature, although the catalytic activity changed depends on the reduction temperature. Thus, we concluded that the reduced perovskite part was also important factor to determine the catalytic activity in the case of Ni doped LAO catalyst. The highest catalytic activity (H2 yield) was attained under the 873\u00a0K reduction temperature.",

     "abstract": "In this study, hydrothermal characteristics of the water\u2013TiO2 nanofluid are evaluated in the rectangular C-shaped chaotic channel by applying the two-phase Euler\u2013Lagrange method. The results show that the fluid temperature distribution in the C-shaped channel is much more uniform than that in the straight rectangular channel due to the intense mixing in the chaotic geometry. By increasing the concentration and reducing the particle size, both convective heat transfer and pressure drop increase in the chaotic channel. For finer particles, due to more intense particle migration related to the Brownian motion, more uniform concentration distribution is obtained at the channel cross section. The model of mean convective heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop in terms of concentration and particle size was developed by neural network. In order to obtain some cases of the variables (i.e. size and concentration of nanoparticles) in which maximum heat transfer along with minimum pressure drop occurs, optimization on neural network model was implemented using methods of two-objective as well as single-objective (i.e. genetic algorithm coupled with compromise programming decision making method). Eventually, optimum cases were suggested for different importance levels of objective functions.",

This method can also prevent the deterioration of tablet properties; e.g., reduced tensile strength and a retarded rate of drug dissolution. The current study prepared tablets using the external lubrication method with varying potential critical process parameters and clarified the process of external lubrication via statistical analysis. In accordance with past results, tablets prepared using the external lubrication method had better tablet properties (higher hardness and more rapid disintegration) than those prepared using the internal lubrication method. Quantitative analyses of the magnesium stearate content and contact angle showed that the wettability of the tablet surface increased with the magnesium stearate content. Analysis of variance showed that all potential critical parameters are influential for the magnesium stearate content, but not for the disintegration of tablets. In addition, predictions of the magnesium stearate content and disintegration time of tablets made using a model equation correlated well with observed values. The external lubrication method can thus be applied by identifying the critical process parameters in the compression process during the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical products.",

It is the purpose of this study to investigate the values of pKa measured using microelectrophoresis for saturated fatty acids with chain lengths between C10 and C18. This returned an average pKa value of 4.0 for these saturated fatty acids. By the method of measurement, this value should be considered as the surface pKa value as opposed to bulk pKa values. The graphs of mobility vs. pH showed isoelectric points between 2 and 3, with the existence of positive surfaces on the particles of fatty acids confirmed. Some examples of the relevance of pKa values for saturated fatty acids in the flotation of non-sulphide minerals have also been given.",

This paper presents an investigation of the effect of temperature on tensile strength by a combined experimental and numerical method. Experimentally, tensile strength and fracture distance of palm residues combusted at 820\u00a0\u00b0C were measured as a function of temperature (25\u2013800\u00a0\u00b0C). The results showed that the tensile strength is strongly dependent on temperature and the liquid bridge between particles may transform into partially solid bonds with increasing temperature. In numerical simulation by means of discrete element method (DEM), the cohesive force between particles was modelled using the so called Bonded Particle Model (BPM) and Capillary Force Model (CFM). The parameters of BMP and CFM models at different temperatures were determined by an empirical equation. Comparison with the existing test results showed that the model can reasonably describe the behaviour of biomass combustion ash under various temperatures. It was therefore confirmed that the proposed cohesive force model can be used in the DEM-based simulation of biomass ash deposition in the combustion devices, leading to better understand the phenomena of shedding and erosion in the future.",

The modified two-component heterogeneous model of Buongiorno is employed for the nanofluid which considers Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis, the significant base of nanoparticle migration. Because of low dimensional structures and surface roughness of microchannels, a slip condition is considered at the surfaces to appropriately examine the non-equilibrium region at the fluid\u2013solid interface. After the fluid flow is assumed as fully developed, the governing equations including continuity, momentum, energy, and nanoparticle volume fraction are simplified to ordinary differential equations and solved numerically. With the scale analysis of governing equations, it is revealed that the temperature-dependent buoyancy effects are negligible; however, the concentration-dependent buoyancy effects have significant impacts on flow and heat transfer characteristics. It is also shown that the imposed thermal asymmetry distorts the symmetry of velocity, temperature and nanoparticle volume fraction profiles and changes the direction of nanoparticle migration. In addition, the best performance is achieved under one-sided heating and a higher slip velocity at the surfaces.",

Homogeneous mixing and solid loading are the factors that strongly influence the final product properties.

Due to its natural irregular shape of HDH-Ti powder, the feedstock, which is injection mouldable, usually has a lower solid loading than that of spherical powder.

Based on a review of the literature and basic theory of electrical physics, we were able to establish a linear relationship between open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), which led to the formulation of two equations: one of which relates FF directly to series resistance (rs) and the other relates FF to shunt resistance (rsh). This led to the formulation of a new DSSC design strategy with the aim of increasing Voc of the DSSC by reducing rh (part of rs) as well as increasing rsh. The proposed design strategy is based on the fabrication of a multilayer TiO2 microstructure in conjunction with electron orbital hybridization. This strategy was implemented using fifteen sets of experiments aimed at simultaneously optimizing structures in working electrodes at the micro- and electron-scales. The resulting design rules and mechanisms underlying carrier transport provide practical guidance and critical knowledge required for the further development of next generation photo electron devices.",

The obtained results indicate that although all the three mentioned mechanisms improve the heat transfer within the tubes, the HTE due to the use of twisted tapes is greater than that caused by the other two mechanisms. After discovering that the simultaneous use of the three mentioned mechanisms can considerably increase the amount of heat transfer, three different arrangements of the twisted tapes in the nanofluid-containing flat tubes are also evaluated and compared. These three arrangements include the use of one twisted tape, use of two twisted tapes in the same direction and the use of two twisted tapes in different directions.

Various volume fractions of non-polar polyethylene (PE) and polar polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used as the mixed polymer pellets. As the results, with the volume fractions of PET from 0.05 to 0.22, as the temperature is increased up to melting point temperature and above mold temperature, the relative permittivity is decreased as the temperature is increased. However over melting temperature up to the mold temperature, the relative permittivity is slightly increased as the temperature is increased. On the other hand, the dielectric loss and loss tangent are not affected by the temperature variance, and the dielectric loss and loss tangent are increased as the measurement frequency is increased. As the conclusions, at molding temperature 180\u00a0\u00b0C (453\u00a0K), the highest sensitivity of dielectric property is the relative permittivity.

     "abstract": "An experimental study is presented here to understand the stress transmission characteristics under different geometrical arrangements of particulates inside a narrow chamber subjected to axial compression loading. The multi-grain systems considered here are face-centred, simple cubic and poly-dispersed structures, as well as inclusions embedded inside seeded, unseeded and cohesive powder bed of Durcal (calcium carbonate). The distribution of the maximum shear stress, direction of the major principal stress and shear stress concentration factor were obtained using photo stress analysis tomography (PSAT). The results show that the maximum shear stress distribution in the simple cubic structure is chain-like and self-repetitive, i.e., a single grain behaviour is representative of the whole system. This is not the case in the case of other granular packing. In the case of the inclusion surrounded by powder media, the maximum shear stress distribution in the inclusion occurs through ring-like structures, which are different from those observed in the structured granular packing. This tendency increases for an increase in the cohesivity of the surrounding particulates. In the granular systems, the direction of the major principal stress is mostly orthogonal to the direction of loading except in some particles in the random granular packing. In the case of inclusion surrounded by Durcal particulates, the directional of the major principal stress acts along the direction of the axial loading except in the ring region where this tends to be oblique to the direction of axial loading. Estimates of the shear stress concentration factor (k) show that, k tends to be independent of the structural arrangement of granular packing at higher load levels. In the case of inclusion surrounded by powder bed, k for the seeded granulated particulate bed is mostly independent of the external load levels. In the case of unseeded particulate (granulated) bed, a fluctuation in k is observed with the loading level. This suggests that the seeded granules could distribute stresses in a stable manner without much change in the nature of shear stress-transmitting fabric of the particulate contacts under external loading. An increase in the cohesion of particulate bed results in more plastic deformation as shown by the differential shear stress concentration factor. The results reported in this study show the usefulness of optical stress analysis to shed some scientific lights on unravelling some of the complexities of particulate systems under different structural arrangements of grains and surrounding conditions of the inclusions in particulate media.",

The physical properties of the precursors with different concentration of ethanol have been examined by XRD and SEM. The XRD results show that the precursors prepared by this method are typical hexagonal structure. The SEM results show that the particles of the precursors with the presence of ethanol display more spherical and dispersed than those prepared without using ethanol. Galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge experiments demonstrate that the initial discharge capacity of the cathode material (Li1.2Ni0.12Co0.12Mn0.56O2) is improved by the addition of ethanol. In addition, the effects of reaction temperature, the molar ratio of precipitant/total-cations on the morphology of the resultant precursors and the electrochemical properties of the prepared powders are also investigated. Among the synthesized materials, the sample prepared with 10\u00a0vol% ethanol and a fixed concentration ratio ([CO32\u2212]/[M2+]\u00a0=\u00a010) at 65\u00a0\u00b0C exhibits not only a relatively high discharge capacity of 272.1\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121, but also excellent rate performance and good cycling performance.",

It is found that NFM can qualitatively capture the trend of RC with small discrepancies, while VFM cannot reproduce it very much.

All investigations were performed experimentally and numerically, by using Discrete Element Method (DEM).The influences of screw length, observed geometry variations and different types of screw design, on the performances of the screw conveyor-mixer during material transport were explored. The auxiliary mixing action (used to improve the mixing process) was achieved during the transport of the material. The geometry of the screw conveyor is changed by adding three complementary helices oriented in the same or the opposite direction from screw blades. The particles of the material being transported tumble down from the top of the helix to the next free surface, and that segment of helix was used for additional mixing action.

A 3-d discrete element method (DEM) numerical model of the thresher designed using 3-d CAD software is established. Subsequent numerical model of the corn ears is constructed based on the particle agglomeration method. On this basis, corn threshing analysis software has been developed using Visual Studio 2010. The effects of drum rotation rate and feeding amount on the corn ear threshing rate and number of separated corn kernels produced over the drum length are studied. Good agreement has been found between the numerical results and experimental data. As the drum rotation rate, and the feeding amount increase, the corn ear threshing rate increases, and the number of separated corn kernel decreases over the drum length. The feasibility and effectiveness of analysing the corn threshing process using DEM and the allied software are validated.",

Buongiorno\u2019s model is used to incorporate the effects of Brownian motion and thermophoresis for the nanofluid, when the base fluid of the nanofluid is itself a binary fluid such as salty water. In addition the thermal energy equations include regular diffusion and cross-diffusion terms. Using the local similarity method, it is shown that a set of suitable similarity transformations reduces the non-linear coupled PDEs governing on the problem into a set of non-linear coupled ODEs. The analysis shows that velocity, temperature, solutal concentration and nanoparticle concentration profiles in the respective boundary layers depend on ten dimensionless physical parameters, namely the mixed convection parameter \u03bb , the regular double-diffusive buoyancy parameter Nc, the nanofluid buoyancy ratio Nr, the Brownian motion parameter Nb, the thermophoresis parameter Nt, the modified Dufour parameter Nd, the regular Schmidt number Sc, the nanofluid Schmidt number Scn, Prandtl number Pr, and the Dufour-solutal Lewis number Ld. The results are presented in graphical form illustrating the effects of these parameters on boundary layer behavior. A sensitivity analysis of model is tabulated where the difference in each graph can be quantified in terms of root mean square deviation (RMSD) with respect to that with the default parameters. These results are supplemented with the data for the reduced Nusselt number and the two reduced Sherwood numbers, one for the solute and the other for the nanoparticles. It is found that for assisting flow regime the reduced Nusselt number is a decreasing function of each of Nr , Nb and Nt , and an increasing function of each of \u03bb , Nc and Nd . The results demonstrate that the highest heat transfer rate is obtained for the situation that the thermophoresis effects are negligible. Moreover, a reduction in the reduced Sherwood number of nanoparticle is observed with increase in each of Nc and Nt , while this quantity increases with Nb.",

Pressure drop and convection heat transfer behavior of water\u2013silver nanofluid in helical coils were evaluated and compared to the pure water. In the numerical part of the study, incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations, derived from an orthogonal helical coordinate system were solved by finite difference method with projection algorithm using FORTRAN programming language. Homogeneous model with constant effective properties was used for nanofluid. The Local Nusselt number in the entrance region of the helical tubes and the effects of curvature and torsion ratios and Reynolds number have been discussed. In the experimental part, six helical heat exchangers with different curvature and torsion ratios were designed, capable of providing a constant wall heat flux. Pressure drop measurement and fully developed heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt number calculations were carried out and compared with the numerical results.The results show that for laminar flow with constant wall heat-flux boundary condition, the helical tubes with larger curvature ratio lead to higher heat transfer enhancement and higher pressure drop increase, when employing the nanofluid instead of the base fluid. Moreover, compared to using metal Ag nanofluid in straight tubes, utilization of base fluid in helical coils with greater curvature increases heat transfer more effectively. Finally, we conclude that since using Ag nanofluid increases the heat transfer of helical heat exchangers about 3.5\u20133.8%, utilizing this nanofluid could enhance the thermal performance of heat exchangers, which can benefit the industry.",

In this process, PTA ion host stabilizes the CdS particles against aggregation and thioacetamide plays two roles, being at the same time a sulfur source and a capping ligand. Based on the performed analyses it seems that the thioacetamide is more effective on the formation of CdS than PTA. The precipitation of CdS was mainly controlled by the diffusion rate of H2S gas.

Particles were characterized by optical microscopy to determine size, size distribution, shape and morphology comparing to a reference material commercially available. Two shape factors calculated with the results of image analysis, circularity and projected area equivalent diameter (Heywood diameter), as well as span value for size distribution, were chosen as responses for analyses of variance. Outlet temperature was shown to be the most important factor to control during the process in order to produce particles with high value of circularity. Particle size represented as Heywood diameter was affected by ethanol while particle size distribution was affected by concentration of mannitol solution. Desirability function was applied to determine the best process parameters and to predict the responses, which were confirmed experimentally. Morphology was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy and confirmed results of ANOVA for circularity, showing that regulars and spherical particles were produced at low temperature. FTIR and DRX were used to demonstrate that particles did not modify polymorph after the spray drying keeping the same \u03b2-form of the raw mannitol.",

Aim of present investigation was to understand the influence Benzoic acid (BA) on recrystallization behavior of Albendazole (ABZ) using slow (conventional) evaporation technique. Benzoic acid treated crystals showed a unique melting behavior, improved solubility (12.53\u00a0folds) and dissolution rate (8.6\u00a0folds) with higher drug content (72.17%). Control batch crystals showed a possibility of a new crystalline form with much improved properties. SEM photographs revealed bigger and plate-shaped BA treated crystals with aspect ratio near to unity which improved flow and packability of crystals. Heckel parameters suggested greater plastic deformation and high tensile strength with negligible elastic recovery compared with pure drug. FT-IR studies assumed a formation of hydrogen bond between drug and excipient. Treated crystals were stable even after six months of accelerated stability study. Use of directly compressible excipients could be minimized in the tablet formulation in case of treated crystals. Pharmacokinetic study showed improved (3.42 times) in vivo performance in rats. In this study, improvement in physicomechanical and pharmacokinetic parameters of Albendazole by its cocrystallization could be highlighted.",

Initially the synthesized samples contained MgO, B4C, SiC and a small amount of magnesium borates, residual carbon and silicon. XRD analysis after acid leaching of combustion products showed a great effect of acid leaching on removing the impurities. The remaining substances significantly reduced by increasing the energy of milling. The comparison of diffraction patterns after synthesis and after acid leaching showed that acid leaching had moved the peaks to the lower angles. This is due to the development of solid solution and a decrease in contraction stress during the synthesis. Optimum sample prepared with milling parameter of ball to powder ratio of 20:1, rotation speed 300\u00a0rpm and milling time of 12\u00a0h and synthesized at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C furnace temperature. The average crystallite size of B4C and SiC were calculated less than 15\u00a0nm. These values are consistent with the TEM results while most of grain size was less than 30\u00a0nm.

Optimization of the operating variables (nanosilica particle size, and percentage of addition) involved using (WinQSB) and (Statistica) software to predict the optimum conditions. Samples have good SiO2 value of about 99.2% increased up to 99.83% after leaching with sulfuric acid.

AD takes place at room temperature, and a variety of materials can be utilized as the substrate. Deposition occurs at a relatively rapid rate, and the product is a dense, nano-crystalline thick film. One limitation for AD is related to the suitability of powders. In addition to the many other process variables, the success of the deposition depends on the starting powder and its preparation, determined by trial and error. In this work, a broad experimental study about the suitability of 14 alumina powders for AD was carried out on two different substrates, alumina and glass. Three powder properties, particle size, d50, specific surface area, SBET, and compressibility index, CI, were measured and associated with the success of the subsequent deposition. For alumina substrates (high hardness), it was found that a relatively high powder specific surface area (5.5\u20138 m2/g) correlated with good film deposition and adhesion. For glass substrates, initial deposition was obtained with almost all powders; however, problem with long term stability, apparently related to residual strain, was witnessed using many powders. Hi quality, well-adhered, stable AD films in this case were associated with comparatively lower SBET and a compressibility index within a tight range of about 44\u201347%.",

Incorporating PEG into TiO2 network enhanced not only catalyst porous structure, but also increased the fraction of anatase phase. The use of low-molecular-weight PEGs resulted in catalysts with increased anatase content and enlarged specific surface area. The catalyst photoactivity was estimated through degradation of organic pollutants: Reactive Black 5, arylazo pyridone dye and phenol. The results revealed that the photoactivity was following the same order independently of target pollutant: TiO2/P600\u00a0>\u00a0TiO2/P200\u00a0>\u00a0TiO2/P2000\u00a0>\u00a0TiO2/P10000\u00a0>\u00a0TiO2. BET surface area and anatase fraction, rather than pore diameter or pore volume, were found to be predominant catalyst property determining the activity for particular reaction system. The existence of synergistic effect between anatase and rutile phases was confirmed for the most active catalysts TiO2/P200 and TiO2/P600. These catalysts showed similar activity in dye degradation, while TiO2/P200 displayed significantly lower activity in phenol degradation, which was attributed to its lower sorption capacity and lower UV light utilization. The difference in the reactivity between investigated pollutants was discussed in relationship with their size, structure and sorption ability.",

Particles have not always regular shapes and this makes the packing problem more complex. Understanding the packing characteristics and enhancing the packing density of granular systems is of interest for different industries. In the present work, packing density of an irregular shape particulate system is investigated. The approach is applied on anode-grade calcined coke aggregates with the aim of improving the Vibrated Bulk Density (VBD) of the aggregate recipe which is currently used in industry. A three-dimensional imaging technique is coupled with Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations to model the coke particles. To study the packing of an industrial aggregate recipe, a sample with only the largest fraction of coke particles were created by DEM. Then, the pore size distribution of this sample was obtained. New aggregate recipes were created according to the results of the pore size distribution. Results showed that the modified recipes with even a lower number of size fractions hold higher vibrated bulk densities than the standard industrial sample. The voids tracking method used in this study is an effective tool to study the packing density of granular systems.",

So far a review and comparative benchmarking of the various available screening process models has not been performed, although they are of high relevance, especially in industrial applications, due to their simplicity and easy use. To perform the benchmarking of batch screening process models, it is not relied on experimental investigations, but on detailed DEM-simulations involving both spherical and non-spherical particles in the investigation here. The DEM-simulations allow examining different particle characteristics such as size, shape, friction, as well as overall mass and size distribution. In addition, screen characteristics such as screen dimensions and surface as well as operational parameters including vibration frequency, stroke angle and amplitude are considered. On the basis of the DEM-simulations screening efficiencies are obtained which allow the adjustment and thereon benchmarking of the process models through parameters such as the residual particle mass on the screen.",

The change in internal structure of aggregates having different packing properties is examined by Lagrangian simulation method. The many-body hydrodynamic interaction is rigorously estimated by Stokesian dynamics approach while the adhesion of aggregate is manifested via particle\u2013particle interaction. The simulation results show that the restructuring of aggregate originates from the superimposition of rotational and extensional component of simple shear flow. The aggregate rearranges its particles so that a stable structure corresponding to the applied shear flow is obtained. The stable structure is considered as dynamic equilibrium resulting from the balance of the forming and the disintegrating of the bonds between particles. The stable structure of aggregate is dependent strongly on shear condition but weakly on initial structure of aggregate. Despite of the significant difference in the initial packing properties, the stable structure reveals only slightly different. The dependence of stable structure on high shear tress condition is similar for all aggregates. The difference in stable structure of aggregate at low shear stress arises from the irreversible behavior of particle from quasi-stable structure to static structure.",

The flow stability was characterized by the pressure drop evaluation (the uniformity and amplitude of the fluctuations) and visual observations (the flow symmetry). The effect of several geometrical conditions, such as the inlet design, prismatic angle and draft plates on the bed behaviour was investigated for different particles and bed inventories exposed to different air flow rates. The prismatic angle was found to have a strong impact on the spouting characteristics. A method to improve significantly the spouting quality and to make the spouting stability independent on the gas inflow velocity is presented. Compared to the reference geometry the prismatic angle was changed to a higher value and the apparatus was equipped with draft plates. Whereas, to achieve a stable spouting in a wide range of the air flow rates the design of draft plates should be customized to the bed inventory. Dependent on the static bed height full or open-sided draft plates should be used. In the proposed apparatus implementation, the maximum spouting velocity was almost eliminated for large particles (Geldart D), i.e. a highly coherent dense spouting can pass continuously into the dilute-like stable regime, without stability loss at intermediate gas velocities. The spouting of Geldart B particles is also improved.",

This paper focuses on the influence of test temperature and test time on the attrition mechanism of methanol to olefins (MTO) catalyst in high velocity air jets. The attrition time was prolonged to 144\u00a0h in current study. It has been found that test time should be carefully chosen in order to achieve an equilibrium attrition rate. A short test time is not sufficient to understand the attrition mechanism. Test temperature affects the attrition mechanism significantly. At room temperature the abrasion and fragmentation were found coexisting while at 500\u00a0\u00b0C the abrasion is dominant. The abrasion of MTO catalyst at 500\u00a0\u00b0C results in a severe generation of superfine powder that is hard to capture by downstream cyclones, which is in accordance with the findings in industrial MTO unit. Apparently the attrition test at room temperature cannot reflect the generation of superfine powder.

     "abstract": "Bacteria are a widespread group of organisms. On the microscale, bacteria colonies are of discrete nature. Looking from the mechanical point of view the suspension containing the bacteria may be considered as a system of living active ultrafine particles (size: 0.1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm). In order to understand the mechanical behaviour of the bacteria system it is important to understand the behaviour of a single bacterium. The present paper proposes an adhesive interaction model for the simulation of bacteria cells, which can be also applied for the interaction for other biological cells. The main attention is given to describe and numericaly simulate the interaction of a bacterium with a flat surface within a liquid medium. In the simulations an adhesive force is taken into account. Adhesion plays a significant role, because it can keep a bacterium on the surface. It is described by the attractive van der Waals force. In order to achieve the stick of adhesive particles, additionally developed adhesive\u2013dissipative models are presented. The bacterium interaction is described by an elastic\u2013plastic model; these results are thereafter compared with results from an elastic model. Different known models such as Derjaguin, M\u00fcller and Toporov (DMT) and Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (DLVO) models are considered. Obtained results show the approach and deformation process of an adhesive\u2013dissipative bacterium by presenting force displacement diagrams. The bacterium\u2013surface interaction model is developed in the framework of the discrete element method (DEM). The numerical experiments confirm that force\u2013displacement plots exhibit a hysteresis similar to those observed in Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) experiments. The proposed model can be applied for the numerical simulation of the interaction process of bacteria with a surface, as well as simulations of the sticking process.",

Operating angular rotations \u03c9 used were 1.95, 2.6, 4.28, 5.5, 7, 10, 22.5, 60, 100, 120, 150, 200 and 250\u00a0rpm. The experimental procedure was based on the measurement of the amount of detached reacting matter from the surface of the oil shale particle when it rotates about its axis. Bed temperatures investigated varies from 450 to 800\u00a0\u00b0C. At each test condition the mass of oil shale particle was determined. Granular media was characterized by its rheological properties: Strain rate \u03b3 (0.41\u20134.62\u00a0s\u22121), particle frequency \u03c9 (rpm), \u03b7 bed sand viscosity and shear stress \u03c4 (1.84\u201320.79\u00a0Pa). The largest propensity to undergo important abrasion by rotation was observed for experimental temperatures greater than 600\u00a0\u00b0C for all experimented angular rotations. Rates of abrasion were determined for the different angular velocities and compared each other. A clear distinction was observed between thermal degradation processes and rotational effects as is shown in all the figures. Increases in the strain rate increased the abrasion by rotation and contributes to the particle weight loss if bed temperature exceeds 700\u00a0\u00b0C. More than 5% of the particle mass loss is due to the simple fact that particle rotated at angular velocities greater than 7\u00a0rpm in granular media heated to 800\u00a0\u00b0C and expanding shear stress exceeded 2\u00a0s\u22121. The course of abrasion of oil shale particles is described as a function of the elapsed time, particle rotation velocity and bed temperature. Experimental results show that there is a competition between abrasion due to particle rotation and thermal particle decomposition depending on bed temperature and angular rotation velocity. This competition reveals the existence of an Inversion point ( t i , T , \u03b1 i ) \u03c9 i where abrasion activity decline after a certain period ti if compared to the thermal degradation activity. \u03b1i refers to the extent of oil shale particle thermal degradation if silica bed is hold at temperature T.",

The constants are not much dependent on the concentration, but they change significantly by varying Peclet number. They increase with increasing Peclet number, which shows that at higher Peclet numbers, the effects of shear rate and viscosity gradient are intensified on particle migration. Meanwhile, by raising Peclet number, the role of shear rate becomes more pronounced in comparison with the viscosity gradient. At lower Peclet numbers with intensified effect of the Brownian diffusion, a more uniform concentration distribution was achieved. Moreover, the particles enlargement considerably intensifies the non-uniformity in concentration distribution. Furthermore, particle migration causes non-uniformity in the properties distribution and consequently reduces the thermal conductivity and viscosity adjacent to the wall due to lower concentration there. Thus, smaller pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient were obtained in comparison with the case of applying uniform properties.",

In order to study the effects of a plethora of parameters on the boundary layer flow and heat and mass transfer, a practical range of these parameters have been utilized. An accurate numerical solution of the governing equations based on the finite difference method is obtained and the effect of various physical parameters such as the Prandtl number, Lewis number, thermophoresis parameter, and the Brownian motion parameter on the thermal, hydrodynamic, and concentration boundary layers is evaluated. In order to examine the alteration of the thermal convective coefficient, a dimensionless heat transfer enhancement ratio parameter is introduced. The results show that the variation of different thermodynamic parameters induces substantial impression on the behavior of the nanoparticles distribution. For example, it is found that an increase in the value of the Lewis number leads to a decrease in the value of the non-dimensional nanoparticles volume fraction at the sheet, but it does not have any influence on the thermal and hydrodynamic boundary layers. Increasing the Prandtl number is predicted to decrease the thermal boundary layer thickness and the volume fraction of nanoparticles at the surface.

The mechanism that the Al liquid formed at the high temperature repeatedly flows and reacts with the coming nitrogen gas was proposed to explain the evolution from the large aluminum particle into the aggregate with small particles. Some further experiments were also carried out to demonstrate this mechanism.",

Here we show for the first time that a nano-spaced polymer film consisting of hollow silica nanoparticles (HSNPs) dispersed in a polyurethane (PU) matrix provides good thermal insulation and is transparent. The HSNPs, having a silica shell and nano-sized hollow interior, are formed by removing the core from a core\u2013shell structure prepared by sol\u2013gel reaction of silicon alkoxide (TEOS). One advantage of using HSNPs is that a quasi-vacuum state in the nano-space is formed when the size of the space is close to the length of the mean free path of the air molecules in the space. Heat therefore tends to be transferred along the silica shells of HSNPs instead of through other materials in the film. Another advantage is that there are many defects in silica shells with low apparent density that are prepared using controlled sol\u2013gel reaction conditions. The phonon-defect scattering in the silica shell suppresses heat conduction despite of high thermal conductivity of silica. Dispersed HSNP flocculation in the film is the key to both transparency and good thermal insulation.",

Dilation of pharmaceutical powders and mixtures was measured in a rotating drum at various speeds of rotation (10, 15, 20, 25\u00a0rpm). It was interesting to note that the dilation did not change with an increase in the rotational rate of the cylinder. Furthermore, studies carried out in various sizes of cylinders showed that the dilation was poor in the lower and higher volume of cylinder. An optimum volume of the cylinder with highest dilation was found to exist in the middle scale. Decrease or increase in the cylinder volume hindered the dilation of powder. Lubricated blends exhibited higher bed density than the non-lubricated blends, and therefore showed lower dilation. More interestingly, higher dilation was achieved at 35\u201345% of fill level of cylinder. Any further increase or decrease of powder fill level beyond this range drastically decreased the ability of powders to dilate. Eventually, dilation of powders decreased with increased in powder bed density. Cohesive materials when mixed with free flowing powders could improve the flowability (reduced dilation) only when they constituted 40\u201360% of blend composition. Percentage of free flowing material below this composition was found to be ineffective in reducing the dilation.",

Since Ni(NO3)2\u22c56H2O aqueous solution cannot be heated to over 300\u00a0\u00b0C by microwave irradiation owing to the low microwave absorptivity of its intermediate, the final product of the denitration reaction (NiO) could not previously be obtained by microwave heating. We propose a novel NiO synthesis method that uses microwave heating without the risk of chemical contamination. In this technique, a NiO powder reagent (the same as the final product) was added to the solution of the raw material to function as a microwave acceptor. Moreover, the denitration efficiency to NiO could be improved by setting an adiabator around the reactor to increase the temperature homogeneity in the reactor, as well as raise the temperature at the periphery. Numerical simulations also reveal that the use of the adiabator results in remarkable changes in the electromagnetic field distribution in the reactor; consequently, temperature inhomogeneity decreases. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the denitration efficiency to NiO, which is calculated from the simulated temperature distribution, approximately agrees with the experimental data. Accordingly, this indicates that the simulated results can estimate the progress of the denitration reaction to NiO using this microwave heating method.",

In a powder metallurgy process, particle or phase segregation generates a fluctuation of the particle distribution in powder\u2013binder mixture from point-to-point. Such demixing occurs generally before or during the injection process and can lead to the formation of defects such as cracks, distortions or heterogeneous shrinkage of the sintered parts. Thermogravimetric analysis, pycnometer density and differential scanning calorimetry were used to measure respectively the mass loss after binder burnout, the density and the enthalpy of fusion on several feedstocks with different solid loadings. It was demonstrated that the variation in solid loading can be measured with a sensitivity of at least \u00b10.5\u00a0vol.% of powder using the TGA and PD techniques only. It was also shown that the thermogravimetric analysis and the pycnometer density results are independent of feedstock formulation and can be obtained without the use of a calibration curve. The thermogravimetric analysis and the pycnometer density measurement are complementary and well-adapted experimental methods to measure the effects of segregation on powder injection molded green components.",

     "abstract": "The internal microstructure of agglomerates has a great influence on their stability and breakage characteristics. Therefore, to optimize production processes and to improve characteristics of the final product, it is very important to understand dependencies between structural and mechanical properties of agglomerates. In this paper, we discuss usage of the discrete element method (DEM) for understanding the breakage behavior of spherical agglomerates under uniaxial compression depending on their microstructure. A flexible stochastic model has been developed to generate agglomerates with various types of microstructures. As an example, we investigate the effect of the primary particle size distribution on agglomerate strength and breakage behavior. In particular, the size distribution of primary particles is specified by a mixing of two fixed particle sizes. The model construction ensures that the size and mass of agglomerates as well as primary particles and binder content remain constant in all experiments. From the obtained results it can be seen that the breakage behavior of agglomerates is influenced in different ways. Breakage energy and the maximum force applied before the primary break depend on the mixing ratio and the variability inside the microstructure. On the other hand, the size of fragments is very similar for all mixing ratios.",

Prediction of the breakage distribution as a function of specific comminution energy and material characteristics is of great significance for DEM simulations. King (2001) proposed a single parameter breakage model, consisting the parameter t10 along with a tuning constant \u03b1. In the present study, single particle breakage data obtained from a series of drop-weight tests were fitted into the model to find out the corresponding values of the parameter and tuning constant. The dependencies of these values are studied and mathematically modeled against the specific comminution energies and material characteristics. Methods are suggested to predict the parameter t10 with the help of JK model (Napier-Munn et al., 1996). Further, based on the proposed mathematical models, DEM simulations have been performed and validated experimentally. The central idea is to draw a direct approach that can simulate the particle breakage due to impact in a complex grinding environment. Relatively easier ways are discussed to predict t10 and \u03b1 of the single parameter breakage model which makes it a proper candidate for the modeling and simulation purpose. Also, it is reconstituted that \u03b1 is a material characteristic, reasserting King\u2019s model as a single parameter model.",

Uncertainty was related to insufficient sample volume. The error function was theoretically described by assuming an inverse relation to the sample volume. Hence, an easy to implement guideline to increase accuracy was established. Verification was performed using spray dried dispersions, SDDs. Practically, bulk density rather than sample volume was used for risk evaluation. Procedures such as compacting a sample into a pellet or using a low volume instrumental calibration mode were implemented. Risk assessment of morphology or crystal form change was included in the guideline.Furthermore, a simplified approach using true density as a central parameter was developed to assess surface area and porosity. For spherically shaped SDDs, surface area can be estimated from true density and particle size, and porosity can be estimated from true and bulk densities. A surface roughness parameter, theoretically derived, leads to a surface area scale factor of 2.28, which provides results in good agreement with the experimentally obtained surface areas. Also, SDD porosities follow a trend similar to those obtained by mercury porosimetry.",

At the minute gas\u2013liquid interfaces, local supersaturation increases due to the accumulation of glycine and antisolvent caused by the negative surface potential of the minute-bubbles. Thus, the nucleation rate is faster and the production of metastable/unstable polymorph is accelerated. At a solution temperature of 303\u00a0K, the saturated glycine solution and methanol as an antisolvent were mixed by the two different addition orders as follows: Gly solution/MeOH system, methanol was added into a saturated glycine solution; MeOH/Gly solution system, a saturated glycine solution was added into methanol. While mixing methanol with the saturated glycine solution, N2 minute-bubbles with an average diameter of 10\u00a0\u03bcm were continuously supplied to the mixed solution using a self-supporting bubble generator and a glycine polymorph was produced.

N2-adsorption/desorption, SEM and TEM displayed that the resulting Pd(II)-Bi2O3/RLDH composite possess high crystallinity, hierarchical structure as well as large specific surface area. EDX and ICP-AES were used to investigate the type and content of the elements in Pd(II)-Bi2O3/RLDH. UV\u2013vis DRS confirmed that Pd(II)-Bi2O3/RLDH, with a low band gap of \u223c2.19\u00a0eV, has a broad absorption in visible light region. The as-prepared Pd(II)-Bi2O3/RLDH displayed significant photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation. Factors such as calcination temperature, LDH content and Pd (II) content were studied, which may affect the photodegradation of MB. The stability of the photocatalysts was comfirmed using reclaimed Pd(II)-Bi2O3/RLDH in four successive runs, demonstrating its great potential application in the field of photocatalysis. With the supports of the characterization analysis and experimental results, a reasonable mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of MB by Pd(II)-Bi2O3/RLDH was proposed.",

In addition, electric currents generated by the charge transfer were simultaneously measured at the second vibrating plate. From these measurements, we verified that the charge balance in this system holds. Furthermore, we found that the charge transfer depends on various factors, such as the initial charge, chemical and electrical properties, travel length of particles, and the external electric field. We also found that the equilibrium charge of particles depends on the chemical property and external electric field. The equilibrium charge and the rate of tribocharging were evaluated analytically from the relationship between the initial and transferred charges without changing the travel distance of particles.

We here proposed a novel tapered rotating fluidized bed granulator in order to reduce the particle entrainment and increase the yield of granules. The tapered rotating fluidized bed consists of a cylindrical vessel with two frustum ends, in which superficial velocity of the fluidization air is less increased toward an air exit at the center of the vessel. Wet granulation of a fine cohesive powder classified into Geldart Group C was conducted by the developed tapered rotating fluidized bed, and its performance as a granulator for handling a fine cohesive powder was evaluated. The results showed that the particle entrainment was decreased by merely modifying the vessel geometry to the tapered geometry, resulting in a significantly increase in the yield of granules. The particle size distribution of the granules showed unimodal distribution, confirming that granules are able to be prepared from a fine cohesive powder without coarse granules.",

The results show that the porosity increases with the friction coefficient and surface energy while decreasing with the restitution coefficient. The coordination number and intersection angle vary in line with the porosity correspondingly and the correlation between the macrostructural and microstructural properties of the packing structure is established. The variations of the rod packing due to the friction coefficient and surface energy are much more pronounced than that of the restitution coefficient and stiffness.

The two-dimensional multi-fluid CFD model coupled with electrostatic model is established to simulate the electric effects on the fluidized bed hydrodynamics. As the particle charge magnitude increases, the bubble size and bubble detachment time are reduced, while the electrostatic force on particle is enhanced obviously. By imposing the DC electric field, the bubble is split in cross-flow field and stretched to be sharper in co-flow field. Meanwhile, the particle self-generating electric field and particle velocity are strengthened around the bubble, distributor and wall. For the application of AC electric field, the bubble deforms in the lower frequency field, and the particle self-generating electric field declines near the wall, which will reduce the particle segregation and agglomeration towards the wall.",

The physicochemical characterizations showed superior properties of sonochemically synthesised nanocatalysts like homogenous morphology, small and dispersed particles, and strong interaction. Addition of CeO2 as a promoter to acid-treated clinoptilolite remarkably increased catalytic activity. XRD analysis demonstrated acid treatment of clinoptilolite induces noticeable decrease in crystals size and their crystallinity, while the specific surface area increased. Furthermore, no obvious peaks related to MnOx were found in XRD patterns even at high loadings of Mn which might be attributed to the high dispersion of particles in sonochemistry method. Due to the effect of sonication power, even at high loadings of Mn(15%), the morphology of the catalyst was agglomeration free and surface area was high. Comparison of catalytic activity of sonochemically and impregnated Mn(5%)/Clinoptilolite\u2013CeO2 nanocatalyst showed that sonochemically synthesized catalyst can oxidize toluene 5\u201310% more than impregnated one at all temperature ranges.

Then, the Ni(II)/(Zn(II)\u00a0+\u00a0Ni(II)) atomic ratio in starting solution (XNi) was 0\u20130.10. XRD results indicated that crystallization of the layered structure of ZHC was strongly inhibited with an increase of XNi and no new particles were generated. The Ni(II) was incorporated into ZHC crystal by substitution with Zn(II) and the Ni/(Zn\u00a0+\u00a0Ni) molar ratio in the particles was almost consistent with XNi. The ZHC particles formed at XNi\u00a0=\u00a00 were hexagonal plate with a size of ca. 3.2\u00a0\u03bcm and a thickness of ca. 0.3\u00a0\u03bcm. Increasing XNi reduced the size and thickness of ZHC particles. Besides, addition of Ni(II) suppressed the adsorption of CO2 and SO2 gasses on ZHC, because of layered structure of this material to be disintegrated. The foregoing results suggest that atmospheric corrosion of Zn\u2013Ni alloy coating in marine zone forms dense and compact zinc rust layer composed of fine Ni(II)-doped ZHC particles with a low affinity to corrosive gasses on the steels, leading to the suppression of further corrosion of steel.

In this study we focused on a compressed packing fraction as one of the values reflecting the cohesiveness and flowability in a compressed particle flow. In order to estimate the mechanism of the reduction, the effects of an adhesive force of admixed particles on the packing fraction were investigated experimentally.In the experiments, silica particles with 397 and 8\u00a0nm diameters were used as the main and the admixed particles, respectively. The surfaces of the admixed particles were modified chemically in order to vary their adhesive force with maintaining morphological and mechanical characteristics.At more than 2.0% mixing mass ratios, the decreasing rate with increasing the mass ratio in net difference value of packing fraction for modified admixed particles was smaller than that for the raw particles. A calculation of the packing fraction of the admixed particles in the voids of main particles revealed that difference of the decreasing rates could be attributed to the difference of cohesivenesses between raw and modified admixed particles.The maximum packing fraction achieved by the modified admixed particles was lower than that achieved by the raw admixed particles. However, when a mixture of main and admixed particles was packed by tapping, the packing fraction with modified admixed particles was higher than that with raw admixed particles. This implied that the adequate adhesive force of admixed particles is different by the applied compression force value.",

     "abstract": "The success of many industrial processes largely depends on the structural characteristics of aggregates. In intensive aerobic digestion process for wastewater treatment applications, the structural characteristics namely aggregate shape, size and therefore the aggregate surface area strongly influence the transfer of dissolved oxygen from the aeration process to aggregates of harmful contaminants/microorganisms.The aim of this study was to apply Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) techniques to the aggregation of suspended particles (microorganisms) to quantify the available surface area for convection and diffusion as a function of particles number concentration and surface charge. The simulation inputs included particle and fluid characteristics such as particle size and density, solid concentration, suspension pH and ionic strength. A post processing method based on the Go-chess concept was developed to quantify the surface area of aggregate structure. The simulation results showed that whilst an increase in connection points increases the total surface area of the aggregate, this does not necessarily translate into an increase in the surface area available for oxygen transfer as combinations of open and close pores are formed. Aggregate surface area was directly determined by aggregate structural characteristics, and increased rapidly when the coordination number was below 3.5 and the fractal dimension was less than 1.5. A correlation for prediction of aggregate external surface area was also proposed as a function of aggregate structural characteristics in terms of fractal dimension and coordination number.",

The results show improvement in micro hardness of the material. The quasi-static and dynamic tests are carried out using Instron testing machine and split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB), respectively. The improvement is believed to be due to strengthening mechanisms such as Orowan and enhanced dislocation density induced by thermal mismatch phenomenon and not by grain refinement described by the Hall\u2013Petch effect. The results from quasi-static compressive tests reveal higher strength for quasi-static hot pressed samples than those produced under dynamic compaction. However, the dynamic compressive tests using SHPB indicate similar compressive strength for both quasi-statically and dynamically compacted samples.",

To allow explicit solutions, we approximate particle breakage mechanisms with assumed functional forms for breakage frequencies. This new framework for solving (PBEs) for batch and continuous flow systems proposed in this work uses the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) and the variational iteration method (VIM). These semi-analytical methods overcome the crucial difficulties of numerical discretization and stability that often characterize previous solutions in of the PBEs.

Whereas recycling of such shop floor waste by melting and landfill are well known, that by powder metallurgical process has not received significant attention in published literature. The present work attempts to fill this gap. Initially, waste material (forging scale and grinding sludge) was separately pulverised using ball mill to obtain the respective powders. For carbothermic reduction, graphite (powder of particle size <5\u00a0\u03bcm) was homogeneously mixed with the two oxide powders. Each of the two mixtures was compacted in a die into a number of pellets. These were sintered for in-situ reduction of the metallic waste. The effect of the source of powder (grinding sludge or oxide scale), quantity of reducing agent cum lubricant, i.e., graphite powder, compaction parameters such as compaction pressure, compact weight and sintering parameters such as sintering temperature and time on reduction and densification characteristics were analysed using Taguchi based experimental design. The results showed significant effect of graphite content and sintering temperature on the degree of reduction and densification. The source of scrap was found to be important since samples from grinding sludge showed higher reduction and densification than forging scale. The analysis of variance was used to establish the individual effects and interactions like that between source of scrap and graphite addition. This was found to contribute most towards degree of reduction and densification. It was found that degree of reduction alone does not necessarily guarantee high degree of densification.",

     "abstract": "Particle size distribution of powders plays a very important role in determining the critical chemical and physical properties of the particulate systems. Precise determination of particle size distribution depends on effective sampling of the powders, which is more pronounced for the particulate systems with a wide particle size distribution. Predominantly, the significant increase in the total surface area of the powders at nanometer scale particle sizes may lead to improper characterization of the bulk if the sampling technique fails to collect and represent them in the analyses. In this study, effects of sampling on the precision of particle size analysis are studied on a clay sample with a wide particle size distribution (particles ranging from nanometer to micrometer sizes) using light scattering technique in aqueous media. Three different sampling methods are applied to systematically analyze the effect of sampling on particle size measurements including; riffling the original sample into sixteen equal parts, sampling the powder after removing the very fine and very coarse size particles and riffling to sixteen parts and finally by riffling the powder to the exact feed amount of the particle size analyzer. The effectiveness of the applied methods were compared statistically by calculating the coefficient of variance (CV) values of the 10%, 50% and 90% passing particle size data of the sequential runs. The most effective sampling method was determined to be riffling the sample to the exact feed amount of the analyzer based on obtaining the minimum CV values of the measurements. In the second part of the study, results of size distribution analyses conducted by different particle size analyzers utilizing numerous characterization techniques are compared using the most effective sampling technique developed in the first part. It is observed that the use of different characterization equipment tend to result in variations in the particle size distributions of the same powder which presents another variability in classification of the wide particle size distribution powders.",

Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 powder with sub-micron particle size was produced by fusion-mechanical milling.

As the sintering temperature increased, the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity of the sintered body decreased and the thermal conductivity increased. In addition, the figure of merit (ZT) decreased with increasing sintering temperature. The sintered body, when sintered for 180\u00a0s at 573\u00a0K, displayed a figure of merit of approximately 1.15 in the range between room temperature and 473\u00a0K.",

X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy have been used to confirm the formation of single phase cubic spinel structure. The X-ray diffraction patterns have been analyzed employing Rietveld refinement technique. The surface morphology and particle size of the samples have been examined using FE-SEM and TEM. Substituting small amount of Y3+ cation causes significant reduction of the particle size. The magnetic hysteresis curve recorded at room temperature using VSM over a field range of \u00b12\u00a0T shows enhancement in coercivity and reduction in highest magnetization with the Y3+ substitution. The enhancement of coercivity is attributed to the transition from multidomain to single domain state. The cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants for present samples has been determined by \u201claw of approach\u201d to saturation which suggests the smaller value for substituted sample (x\u00a0=\u00a00.05) than that of unsubstituted sample (x\u00a0=\u00a00.0). ZFC and FC magnetization measurement over the temperature range 300\u2013900\u00a0K shows blocking temperature is far above than room temperature. The decrease of highest magnetization and magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant is ascribed to weakening of superexchange interaction and surface effect.",

     "abstract": "The effects of nanoparticles diameter and concentration on natural convection heat transfer of a nanofluid around a vertical cone embedded in a Darcy porous medium is theoretically investigated utilizing the drift-flux model. The thermal conductivity and the viscosity of the nanofluid are assumed as simultaneous functions of temperature and local volume fraction of nanoparticles using experimental correlations. In addition, the flux of nanoparticles on the surface of the cone is assumed to be zero. An efficient mathematical approach with a self-similar solution is utilized to theoretically analyze the boundary layer heat and mass transfer of an Al2O3\u2013water nanofluid. The reduced system of ordinary differential equations are general and can be solved for any arbitrary functions of thermal conductivity and viscosity. The analysis of the nanofluid natural convection flow is accomplished for two cases of (i) Tw\u00a0>\u00a0T\u221e and (ii) Tw\u00a0<\u00a0T\u221e. The results show that using nanoparticles would not (would) enhance the heat transfer from the cone for the case of a cone with a hot surface (cold surface). A decrease in the size of nanoparticles or an increase in the volume fraction of nanoparticles causes a decline in the heat transfer rate from the cone when the cone surface is hot. Finally, a comparison between the non-homogenous model (drift-flux model) and the homogenous model of nanofluids is performed. The results demonstrate that the drift-flux model tends to the homogeneous model as the size and volume fraction of nanoparticles increase.",

The influences of mp/(\u03bcD), \u03c1p\u00b7(ugD2/mp), and h/D to the Re were explored by similitude experiments. Finally, the semi-empirical model of induced airflow velocity was established through the Gr and Re. The conclusions are as follows: in the semi-closed transfer station, the Re value increased with the increase of the mp/(\u03bcD) value. Due to the interaction among the particles and change of the specific flow space of the blanking tube on the specific induced air flow, the \u03c1p\u00b7(ugD2/mp) value was found to be proportional to the mp/(\u03bcD) value raised to the power of approximately \u22120.73. Due to limitations of drop heights, particles should be in the acceleration phase from beginning to end, when the resistance drag of the particles is less than the gravity of itself. It was also discovered that the Re value is proportional to the h/D value raised to the power of approximately 0.88. Additionally, similitude experiment results revealed that the Re value is proportional to the Gr value raised to the power of approximately 0.27. On this basis, the semi-empirical model for induced airflow velocity was established. The model can forecast actual values accurately with a deviation of the calculated values limited to plus or minus 10%.

The physicochemical characteristics of microspheres were assessed operating field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD).

Also, DTA, XRD and TGA patterns were determined in order to take different stages of hydrogen release process into consideration. In conformity with the results, only 1.25\u00a0wt% Ni\u2013P coating was deposited on the as-received TiH2, so that its great majority includes Ni5P2 compound. Also, the hydrogen gas release process, in this case, occurs at seven stages, exactly similar to that in TiH2 heat treated in air. The coating causes various stages of hydrogen evolution to undergo a temperature delay roughly equal to 400\u00a0\u00b0C. It means that the coating displaces various stages of hydrogen release process to higher temperatures thereby delaying efficiently the starting time of the reaction approximately for 40\u00a0min. It implies that Ni\u2013P coating can act as an effective diffusion barrier to hydrogen gas evolution. Also, activation energy values for these seven stages were calculated. It was shown that only active mechanism in Ni\u2013P coated TiH2 is internal diffusion, i.e. the diffusion of hydrogen atoms into titanium lattice.",

Experimentally, the collision process was studied using high speed video imaging involving glass ballotini particles (diameter: 1.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0mm) and a supported stationary water droplet (diameter 3.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mm) at different particle impact velocities (Weber number range: 0.2\u201313.5). A transition from partial to complete penetration was observed with decrease in sinking time and significant shape deformation of the droplet when Weber number was increased. Numerically, a one dimensional transient force balance approach was adopted which included contributions of six major forces during the penetration process, including: gravity, capillary, fluid drag, buoyancy, pressure and added mass. It was found that the capillary force controlled the interaction process. Recognizing the limitation of using the one dimensional model to capture the details of the collision physics especially the movement of three phase contact line (TPCL) on the particle surface, a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed using the multiphase volume of fluid (VOF) method combined with the dynamic meshing technique. The CFD model was in good agreement with experimental measurements of the sinking time of the particle and overall collision dynamics including shape deformation of the droplet.",

The so called, phase separation, is the end result of a melt crystallization process and its applicability on the molten drop scale is further discussed in detail. Analysis in the form of light microscopy and ultra-violet spectrometry are also introduced to quantify the final phase separation in the drops and to compare the results. The advantage of using lutrol seeding to control the separation within the molten drops is demonstrated through producing successful phase separation at the drop scale. Together with changing the cooling temperatures, seeding is also proven a successful method to produce a better phase separation and hence lower levels of impurities in the outer layer. Crystallizing the molten drops on lutrol or starch coated surfaces also enhances the quality of the phase separation by a different method, but significantly since it alters the final solidified drops geometry along with changing the cooling conditions.

The parameters were evaluated for their effect on granule properties using a design of experiment based approach. Granules were characterized for their particle size distribution, content uniformity, morphology and porosity.The liquid to solid (L/S) ratio was found to have a dominant effect on the median particle size and exhibited a clear trend. The system was found to be extremely well mixed for all conditions thus implying robust composition uniformity within and between batches, independent of process parameters. The release kinetics of granules within the batch were found to be identical, independent of particle size. The granules were found to be fairly spherical as observed through a scanning electron microscope with no distinct agglomeration. The images indicate granulation by layering and consolidation. All three process parameters were found to have an effect on granule porosity, with the wet massing time having the most pronounced effect.

The geometry simulated is based on the experiment of Clift and Grace (1970), with simulation results compared with their experiments for bubbles in vertical alignment. The model predicts the overall coalescence pattern, but the trailing bubble splits in simulations, unlike experiment.The effect of electrostatics is modeled by solving electrical equations and adopting the Two Fluid Model in MFIX (an open source code). Comparison of uncharged and charged cases for bubbles in vertical alignment shows different bubble coalescence behaviour, with greater asymmetry in the charged case, leading to larger resultant bubble. For bubbles in horizontal alignment, electric charges cause the side bubble to migrate towards the axis of the column, reversing the leading-trailing role of the two bubbles, which led to the decrease in the height of complete coalescence.",

The obtained \u03b7 of DSSC (6.05%) with a TiO2 (P-25)/TiO2 (hydrolysis)\u00a0+\u00a00.005\u00a0M PbS electrode is substantially higher than that of the conventional DSSC (5.11%) with a TiO2 (P-25) electrode, due to improved p\u2013n junctions, light-scattering, and light absorption. Finally, the shell of TiO2 (hydrolysis) protected the core of PbS from the corrosive effects of electrolytes, thereby prolonging the life span of the DSSC. This novel approach to electrode design could lead to advances in DSSC as well as other energy applications including photo-catalysis technology.",

A new model is proposed for dispersion thermal conductivity while a theoretical approach is adopted to predict the particle distribution at the tube cross section considering the effects of non-uniform shear rate, Brownian diffusion and viscosity gradient on particle migration. It is observed that nanoparticles are not distributed uniformly at the tube cross section such that the values of concentration are higher at central regions of the tube and this non-uniformity intensifies at higher mean concentrations and Reynolds numbers. The particle distribution is applied in the proposed dispersion model. The findings show that this dispersion model presents more accurate results than traditional homogenous one. For dispersion model, the velocity profile is flatter than that obtained from the homogenous model. In addition, in the vicinity of the wall, the value of temperature and its gradient obtained from the dispersion model are respectively lower and higher than those from the homogenous model. Increasing the mean concentration results in convective heat transfer enhancement, while causing not much penalty in pressure drop. This indicates that application of nanofluids can result in energy efficiency improvement.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that physical state of intercalating agents played an important role on the intercalation process in scCO2. Solid-state MTAB could hardly intercalate into the interlayer of pretreated MMT (PMMT), though addition of co-solvent benefited the intercalation to some extent. However, liquid TDTHP could intercalate into the interlayer of PMMT easily even without co-solvent and the basal spacing of TDTHP-modified PMMT was larger than that of MTAB-modified PMMT. Scanning electron micrographic (SEM) showed the large compact structure for MMT broke into small random structures after airflow processing and some smaller tactoids and more dispersed structures can be observed for both MTAB-modified PMMT and TDTHP-modified PMMT compared to unprocessed MMT. For TDTHP\u2013PMMT, many clay platelets that were separated from the tactoidal structure and more dispersed structure were observed, which may be helpful for MMT exfoliation and dispersion in polymers.

Protecting sensitive surfaces from dust deposition in the limiting condition of the lunar atmosphere is imperative for future space exploration. This study reports experimental investigation of the collection efficiency of an electrostatic lunar dust collector (ELDC). A dual-functional remotely controlled particle charger/dropper was designed for tribocharging 20\u00a0\u03bcm lunar dust simulants, and a system of Faraday cup connected to an electrometer working in the nC range was used to measure the particle charges. Tribochargeability of two lunar dust simulants was studied, and the process was found to be the most effective with the JSC-1A samples. Aluminum was verified to be a more effective plate material than stainless steel. For the tested range of electrostatic field strength (0.66\u20132.6\u00a0kV/m), the mass-based and charge-based collection efficiencies were in the range of 0.25\u20131% and 0.45\u20131.45% for the low vacuum (10\u22121\u00a0Torr), and 8\u201335% and 12\u201354% for the high vacuum (10\u22125\u00a0Torr) conditions. The linear relationship between the applied voltage and ELDC collection efficiency predicted by the theoretical model was confirmed, and the collection pattern of the collected particles over the collection plate was consistent with the previously computed charge distribution on the collection plate. Aside from validating the predictability of the theoretical model, this study offers a novel method of particle charging inside a vacuum chamber with a variety of applications for studying chargeability of particles at different temperatures and pressures.",

Remarkably, the smallest product particle sizes x50,3\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcm were found for the lowest process temperature (251\u00a0K) at short process times (< 30\u00a0min) and moderate stressing conditions.

An increased solubility of stressed trans-stilbene with respect to the equilibrium solubility of the solid has been observed. By means of 1H NMR spectroscopy and thermodynamic considerations it is shown that the solubility increase is neither due to an isomerisation of the solid nor due to size effects. In fact, mechanical activation leads to an increase in solubility of the stressed solid which was clearly proven by means of solubility studies at different temperatures. The van\u2019t Hoff enthalpy of dissolution of the stressed solid decreased remarkably in comparison to the enthalpy of the non-stressed solid as shown by evaluation of van\u2019t Hoff plots.",

To consider the effects of thermal boundary condition on nanoparticle migration, two distinctive cases including constant heat flux at the outer wall and adiabatic inner wall (Case A) and constant heat flux at the inner wall with adiabatic outer wall (Case B) have been considered. Our results indicate that due to thermophoresis force, the distribution of nanoparticles was denser at the adiabatic wall for the case A which affects the local and the universal fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics. Moreover, inducing a radial magnetic field on the system, heat transfer rate was increased for the case A which had a decreasing effect on the case B. Finally, slip velocity at the walls enhances heat transfer rate for both cases.",

The crystalline structure and average particle size are dependent of type-solvent. The XRD patterns indicated that the LaCoO3 nanopowders prepared with water and ethyl alcohol exhibit a pure perovskite-type LaCoO3 in the rhombohedra structure. The average diameter of the particles prepared with ethyl alcohol and water are 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.49\u00a0nm and 64.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.92\u00a0nm respectively. High resolution transmission electron microcopy revealed an oriented attachment mechanism for the growth of aggregated LaCoO3 nanocrystals. Room temperature magnetization results of the heat treated LaCoO3 nanopowders exhibited a paramagnetic behavior. The average particle size and formation temperature of LaCoO3 obtained in this study is comparatively lower than those reported in the literature.",

The aim of this study is to examine the effect Fe doping on the appearance and development of room temperature ferromagnetism (RT-FM) in the presence of Cu ions as catalyst. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements were carried out to study powders purity and crystalline structure. The XRD results show that Cu and Fe ions are incorporated in the ZnO crystal lattice by occupying Zn sites thereby forming ZnO:Cu:Fe solid solution (SS), whereas XRF confirms the purity of the obtained SS. The magnetic properties of the as-prepared and H-annealed (CdO:Cu:Fe\u2013H) SS powders was investigated as a function of %Fe doping level. It was observed that the magnetic behaviour of pure as-synthesised CdO is mainly diamagnetic with slight FM phase. However, its behaviour with Cu and Fe codoping transforms to the mostly paramagnetic overlapped with small FM behaviour. More importantly, it was found that that annealing under H2 atmosphere induces the reduction of CdO to form pure Cd metal, resulting in total transformation to FM behaviour with strength increases consistently with doping. Furthermore, with hydrogenation a tremendous enhancement of FM parameters takes place so that the Ms increases by about 1230% reaching a very high value of 1.43\u00a0emu/g for 1.8%Fe doping level of CdO.",

To examine the effect of the diameter of a particle on its motion, the trajectories and velocities of different-sized particles, from 0.5 to 500\u00a0\u03bcm in mass median diameter, are analyzed using images captured by a high-speed microscope camera. The results show that larger particles bounce higher, whereas smaller particles easily agglomerate and bounce only slightly, owing to the low restitution caused by their loosely packed structure. In addition, larger particles bounce forward and backward repeatedly, while the agglomerated particles always bounce forward, and consequently have the highest transport velocity among these particles. The particle motion and the transport velocity can be explained by a theoretical probability model.",

Due to their high potential for industrial applications, intensive research has been carried out to better understand their behavior and develop processes to produce them. Trying to face the down scaling demand of high quality particles towards the nanometer range, some conventional methods such as the solid state one reach their limits. The development of other processes are thus required and the synthesis in supercritical fluids can be considered as a promising alternative. This technology exhibits very interesting characteristics such as fast continuous synthesis (few seconds) of high quality nanoparticles (well crystallized nanoparticles with narrow size distribution) with controlled composition (Ba1\u2212xSrxTiO3 with 0\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0x\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a01) at intermediate synthesis temperatures (<400\u00a0\u00b0C) with the use of non-toxic solvents (water, ethanol).

Also, the photocatalytic activities of ZnO synthesized from different precursor concentrations were evaluated by removal rate of methyleneblue (MB) under UV irradiation (365\u00a0nm) at room temperature. SEM revealed two types of ZnO nanoparticles: a quasi-spherical, desert-rose like shape of the secondary particles, which does not change significantly with the increasing of precursor solution concentration as well as some content of the broken spheres.

The results of XRD revealed that all samples were got the principal phase and there was no extra second phase except x\u00a0=\u00a00.2, the lattice parameter was found to vary from 8.337\u00a0\u00c5 to 8.378\u00a0\u00c5, and the crystalline size was from 55.19\u00a0nm to 60.75\u00a0nm. The effect of Cu concentration on saturation magnetization and coercive force were calculated from hysteresis loop, the maximum value of saturation magnetization was 39.46\u00a0emu/g. Electrical resistivity, dielectric constant, dielectric loss tangent and permeability were measured from 10\u00a0MHz to 110\u00a0MHz. Two main contributing factors decrease the electrical properties: the reduction of the fraction of the grain boundary and the electron hopping mechanism between Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions.

For the wider adoption of both current and new powder coating technologies, quality control systems need to be developed, which are easily installed, non-invasive and work in real time. This study evaluates the use of a dual electro-acoustic and electrostatic surface-charge measurement technique as means of realising real-time process control. Simultaneous changes in the signals were obtained under both powder flow-on and -off conditions and also for edge detection of the substrate. It was discovered that the most important variables which governed changes in the acoustic response signal were due to variations in the deposition pressure and stand-off distance, whilst those for the electrostatic response signal came from changes in particle size and deposition stand-off distance. A phenomenological predictive equation was developed based on a two-level full factorial design with five variables for both response factors. The coefficients of determination, r2, for the models were 93% and 98%, respectively, with respective \u03c72 probability values of 99% and 99.5%. This enabled the use of specific limits for any variation of variables amongst those tested to be set up, resulting in the apparatus necessary for the development of a sensitive continuous control system. Examining variations in surface roughness with electrostatic signal was observed to show a linear relationship, decreasing at a rate of 0.19\u00a0\u03bcm per 0.01\u00a0eV, as the effective particle size of Al2O3 was increased.",

The effects of silica concentration and pH on the silica gel properties were investigated. In addition, an improved method was proposed by incorporating two-step aging. The first aging step, which was conducted at pH 10, was used to induce Ostwald ripening to increase the size of the primary particles, and the second step was used to strengthen the gel network. Decreasing the silica concentration by diluting the as-prepared sodium silicate solution tended to increase the surface area and pore volume of the prepared silica gels. The silica gels produced by tartaric acid possessed higher surface area and pore volume than those by HCl. The surface area and pore volume reached approximately 450\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121 and 0.8\u00a0cm3\u00a0g\u22121, respectively.

     "abstract": "The shear testing protocol developed by Jenike in 1964 is commonly used to characterize powder flow in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The protocol requires the measurement of consolidated bulk density and the stress required to shear a powder bed under a series of normal consolidation stresses. In this work, the influence of preconsolidation stress and surface\u2013volume mean particle diameter on the bulk density of 13 milled lactose powders consolidated in an annular shear cell below 5\u00a0kPa is examined. Five empirical correlations that relate bulk density to preconsolidation stress are tested. Each correlation contains two fitting parameters and their values are determined by regression; the parameters are further correlated with particle diameter. A new correlation that simultaneously relates bulk density to preconsolidation stress and particle diameter is proposed. The correlation is valid for milled lactose powders of \u223c29\u2013223\u00a0\u03bcm and preconsolidated at 0.31\u20134.85\u00a0kPa, and can estimate bulk density to \u00b110% of the measured bulk density. It is a convenient tool for the estimation of the bulk density term in an earlier correlation that links the cohesion of milled lactose powders to particle surface area per unit volume and preconsolidation stress.",

In order to examine a liquid meniscus on a microscopic scale we adapted the white light interferometry used in the Surface Force Apparatus. With this approach we extract film thickness with nanometre resolution and its variation over tens of micrometres along the solid surface. We describe here the technique and its application to the spreading of an aqueous 0.1\u00a0M KCl droplet on a freshly cleaved sheet of mica. The film profile was also followed throughout the spreading and subsequent evaporation of an ethanol droplet. Microscopic details obtainable with this technique can provide a check for theoretical descriptions of wetting. They could offer a unique insight into the early stages of coating, liquid creeping and surface reactivity. Such details are relevant to corrosive films creeping on pipes in process plants, evaporation from heat exchangers, and the application and drying of paints and adhesives.",

Gravitational, buoyancy, drag and hydrophobic forces were taken into account. The hydrophobic force was estimated through a single exponential decay law which depends on a pre-exponential parameter K and a decay length \u03bb. It was observed that when \u03bb was less than 10\u00a0nm, the number of the particles that were collected was independent of the strength of the hydrophobic force. In contrast, for values of \u03bb within the range of 10\u2013500\u00a0nm, the capture efficiency increased significantly with the strength of the hydrophobic force and \u03bb. We have also demonstrated how these two parameters affect the particle trajectory around the bubble and thus produce a significant difference in particle collection when the strength and range of the hydrophobic force were varied.",

Removing the water by freeze drying drives the template into a three dimensional network of particles in oil. The gels have oil contents as high as 98% due to the low concentration of particles required. We show that the gel elasticity is a power law function of the particle concentration, consistent with theoretical predictions. A key finding is that the gels can show strain thickening, an increase in elasticity under large applied strains. This is due to a sharp increase in the characteristic size of the gel microstructure above a critical particle concentration.",

Specifically, the HRXMT was used to study the effect of silica/water wt. ratio on the number, surface area and volume distributions of dry water. The results showed that dry water was stable under ambient condition for long time. The technique was also successful in characterizing the structure changes in dry water after exposing to low temperature, high pressure and stirring. Low temperature did not affect the structure significantly, while high pressure and slow stirring broke the structure fairly readily with separation of dry water into the primary solid and liquid phases.

     "abstract": "This study is concerned with a common class of problem involving two phase separation of a dispersed gas flow from a continuous liquid flow under extreme processing conditions. Relatively fine spherical bubbles of order 500\u00a0\u03bcm were generated in the presence of a surfactant under a high shear rate within a rectangular, multi-channeled, cuboidal downcomer. Liquid fluxes, as high as 176\u00a0cm/s through each channel of the downcomer, sheared bubbles from a sintered surface mounted flush to the channel wall before disengaging the downcomer flow into a vertical vessel. Both high feed fluxes, up to 15\u00a0cm/s, and high gas fluxes, up to 5.5\u00a0cm/s, ensured a high gas holdup beneath the downcomer and the hindered rising of the bubbles. Enhanced bubble\u2013liquid segregation was achieved using an arrangement of parallel inclined channels incorporated below the main vertical chamber. This novel device, referred to as the Reflux Flotation Cell, prevented the entrainment of bubbles to the underflow, and significantly reduced the liquid flux to overflow, even in the absence of a conventional froth zone. Extreme upward bubble surface fluxes of up to 600\u00a0s\u22121 were achieved, while counter-current downward liquid fluxes reached 14.4\u00a0cm/s, arguably four times the bubble terminal rise velocity. Hence successful phase separation was achieved while operating well beyond the so-called flooding condition arising from extreme levels of gas and feed fluxes. This hydrodynamic arrangement should find application in increasing surfactant extraction rates in foam fractionation and ion flotation, gas absorption, and even particulate flotation.",

     "abstract": "Ions of inorganic salts are known to affect bubble coalescence via ion size, charge density and polarizability. In this paper, a systematic study of the effect of monovalent anions (F\u2212, Cl\u2212, Br\u2212 and I\u2212) and cations (Li+, Na+ and K+) on the lifetime of liquid films between two bubble surfaces is carried out by applying the thin film interferometry method. To mimic realistic conditions of bubble coalescence in a bubble column, drainage and stability of saline water films driven by different interface approach speeds (10\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm/s) using a nano-pump was investigated. The results show significant effects of interface approach speed on transient film thickness and radius, film stability and rupture, and lifetime of saline water films. The experiments also indicate that there is a critical approach speed of 35\u00a0\u03bcm/s for pure deionised water above which the water films instantly coalesce, i.e., no water film can be obtained. High interface approach speed creates corrugation on saline water film surfaces, which rapidly increases the rates of film radial expansion and drainage, and shortens the film lifetime. There is a critical salt concentration above which the saline water film lifetime abruptly increases. This critical concentration is independent of the interface approach speeds of 10\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm/s. Our experimental results show a decreasing trend of film lifetime with increasing the size of either the cation or anion (NaF\u00a0>\u00a0LiCl\u00a0>\u00a0NaCl\u00a0>\u00a0NaBr\u00a0>\u00a0NaI). The order of the critical concentrations is the opposite of the order of lifetimes. The experimental results highlight the ion-specific effect of salt ions on the water structure and hence the behavior of saline liquid films. These results are relevant to a number of chemical engineering processes taking place in saline water, including mineral separation by flotation using air bubbles in saline water.",

     "abstract": "A facile synthesis route for the production of mesoporous alumina (MA) with tuneable structural properties including BET surface area, pore volume and pore size was systematically investigated by tailoring the amount of template P123 used in the synthesis. The general synthesis strategy was based on a sol\u2013gel process by hydrolysis of aluminium isopropoxide associated with nonionic block copolymer (P123) as the template in a water system. The results showed that the addition of P123 played a crucial role in the synthesis process, leading to very regular variations in the surface area (146.6\u2013261.6\u00a0m2/g), pore volume (0.164\u20132.152\u00a0cm3/g) and pore size (3.5\u201329.9\u00a0nm). MA-supported K species (MA-K) were prepared using KNO3 as the potassium precursor and adopted as the catalysts for biodiesel production. The introduction of K species to MA caused a reduction in the BET surface area and pore volume, but gave rise to a significant increase in pore size, especially when the K species was higher than 10%. K incorporation resulted in the formation of disordered, but significantly larger mesopores. In catalysis, by introducing 20% molar fraction of K species to MA, very high yield of biodiesel was achieved (92.2%) and further increased to 94.4% with 25% K. Based on the control of structural properties of MA, a series of MA-20K catalysts with the same K loading (20%) but different structural properties were prepared by varying P123 addition and were further tested in biodiesel synthesis. Higher biodiesel yields were obtained over the MAs with higher surface area, pore volume and bigger pore size, which were attributed to the reduced mass transfer limitation in catalysis.",

Methane hydrates were formed at 274\u00a0K with incipient gas pressure of 15\u00a0MPa in an unstirred isochoric/isothermal reactor containing aqueous solutions at different initial surfactant loadings. It was found that addition of DTAC had little effect on methane hydrate formation whereas SDS, DAH, and DN2Cl had pronounced promoting effects. This result coincides with the fact that the Krafft point of DTAC is below 273\u00a0K and those of SDS, DAH, and DN2Cl are near room temperature. At a given initial surfactant loading, the effectiveness of the surfactants for reducing the induction time of methane hydrate formation followed the order of SDS\u00a0>\u00a0DAH\u00a0>\u00a0DN2Cl. SDS also gave higher hydrate growth rates than DAH and DN2Cl. At 1000 and 2000\u00a0ppm, however, DN2Cl gave slightly higher final methane uptake than SDS. It was also found that during the nucleation or induction period, addition of SDS, DAH and DN2Cl instead of DTAC, considerably reduced methane mole fraction in the liquid phase. Possible promotion mechanisms of surfactants during the hydrate nucleation period were discussed.",

Microfluidic channels are now complex and combine several functions on a single chip. Fluid flow details are important but relatively few experimental methods are available to probe the flow in confined geometry. We use optical trapping of a small dielectric particle to probe the fluid flow. A highly focused laser beam attracts particles suspended in a liquid to its focal point. A particle can be trapped and then repositioned. From the displacement of the trapped particle away from its equilibrium position one estimates the external force acting on the particle. The stiffness (spring constant) of the optical trap is low thus making it a sensitive force measuring device. Rather than using the optical trap to position and release a particle for independent velocimetry measurement, we map the fluid flow by measuring the hydrodynamic force acting on a trapped particle.

We report a design of synthesis routes based on thermodynamic principles and a fabrication of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) via a solvo-thermal method. To suppress the sublimation of Se, we make use of binary compounds of high vaporization temperature by first converting solid Se into a liquid-like alloy. To simulate the sublimation and vaporization behavior of the system, estimates of the liquid-phase Gibbs energy have to be first derived for the compounds SnSe, SnCu, SnZn and SnS using FactSage (a well-established computational thermo-chemistry platform). Finally, single-phase CZTSe compounds are successfully synthesized and characterized. The relationships among synthesis parameters, microstructure, optical band gap, and visible light absorption are analyzed based on thermodynamic principles. This thermo-chemistry aided research strategy is significant not only to general chemical synthesis involving volatile constituent(s) but also to a wide range of subjects in materials chemistry.",

     "abstract": "This study was concerned with the interaction between a gaseous dispersion of fine particles travelling in the horizontal direction and discrete drops of water falling vertically through the dispersion. A simple analytical model of the particle\u2013drop collision was developed to describe the particle recovery by the drops as a function of the water flux, covering two extremes of relative velocity between the particles and drops. The Discrete Element Method was used to validate the analytical model. Further validation of the model and insights were obtained through experimental studies. The physical process of wetting was observed to be important in influencing the tendency of particles to become engulfed by the drops of water, or to either adhere to the drops or by-pass the drops altogether. Hydrophilic particles were readily engulfed while hydrophobic particles, at best, adhered to the surface of the drop, or failed to attach. Moreover, the recovery of the hydrophilic silica particles was significantly higher than the recovery of hydrophobic coal particles, with the selectivity ratio approximately 1.5. Spherical ballotini particles were the most sensitive, with a notable increase in recovery when cleaned, and evidence of increased recovery with increasing particle size. The recovery of irregular shaped silica flour particles, however, was largely independent of the particle size. A similar result was observed for irregular coal particles, though the recoveries were all lower than relatively more hydrophilic ballotini or silica flour.",

Moreover, due to the nanoparticle migration in the fluid, the no-slip condition of the fluid\u2013solid interface at the walls is abandoned in favor of a slip condition that appropriately represents the non-equilibrium region near the interface.

     "abstract": "The formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an oxidising agent stronger than oxygen, during the grinding of galena (PbS) was examined. It was observed that galena generated H2O2 in the pulp liquid during wet grinding and also when the freshly ground solids were placed in water immediately after dry grinding. The generation of H2O2 during either wet or dry grinding was thought to be due to a reaction between galena and water, when the mineral surface is catalytically active, to produce OH free radicals by breaking down the water molecule. It was also shown that galena could generate H2O2 in the presence or absence of dissolved oxygen in water.The concentration of H2O2 formed increased with decreasing pH. The effects of using mixtures of pyrite or chalcopyrite with galena were also investigated. In pyrite\u2013galena mixture, the formation of H2O2 increased with an increase in the proportion of pyrite. This was also the case with an increase in the fraction of chalcopyrite in chalcopyrite\u2013galena mixtures. The oxidation or dissolution of one specific mineral rather than the other in a mixture can be explained better by considering the extent of H2O2 formation rather than galvanic interactions. It appears that H2O2 plays a greater role in the oxidation of sulphides or in aiding the extensively reported galvanic interactions. This study highlights the necessity of further study of electrochemical and/or galvanic interaction mechanisms between pyrite and galena or chalcopyrite and galena in terms of their flotation behaviour.",

Instillation with an inkjet nozzle was compared with the batch process in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the inkjet technique for controlling particle morphology. The effects of amino acid solution concentration and organic solvent type on particle properties were investigated for instillation with an inkjet nozzle. The morphology of alanine and glycine particles was observed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The inner structure of alanine and glycine particles was investigated by cutting particles with an ion milling machine. Controlling particle size by adjusting the droplet size in the instillation with an inkjet nozzle was found to be feasible. Most alanine and glycine particles produced by instillation were spherical, whereas most particles produced by the batch process were non-spherical. A higher concentration of amino acid in the solution may lead to the generation of solute particles at the spherical interface. It was found that the surface structure of alanine particles changed when using two kinds of organic solvents as anti-solvents. In addition, instillation allowed for \u03b2-glycine to be identified and the crystal polymorph of the particles to be controlled.",

Moreover, solubility of Al in Ti5Si3 is increased with enhancing the X up to 0.4, after that, the solubility of Al in Ti5Si3 is ceased, due to achieving the solubility limit of Al in the Ti5Si3.

     "abstract": "Superfine pulverized coal combustion is a new pulverized coal combustion technology with lots of advantages. A mechanochemical effect exists during the comminution process, which changes the chemical properties of coal significantly. Free radical concentrations and certain functional groups would increase with the decrease of particle sizes. In this paper, we combined electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to study the free radical characteristics of superfine pulverized coal thoroughly. The final results indicate that the EPR spectra of coal are the superimpositions of several lines induced by different paramagnetic centers, which can be fitted by 1 Gaussian and 3 Lorentzian lines. The influences of coal maturities and particle sizes on EPR parameters, such as g-values, linewidths, and spin concentrations, are analyzed in detail. It is shown that with the decrease of particle sizes, more free radicals are induced through bond cleavages. Mechanical forces initiate the accumulation of free radicals in the fractures and inner pore surfaces of coal. Furthermore, the influence of particle sizes on oxygen-containing radicals (i.e., Lorentzian 1 types) is the greatest. This work provides a primary picture of the occurrence modes and spatial distributions of free radicals in superfine pulverized coal. The findings will help form the basis and provide guidance for further studies on revealing the correlations between the free radical reaction pathways and NOx formation mechanisms.",

At last the specific surface area of the product is measured and the particle size distribution (under 80\u00a0\u03bcm) is analyzed by Rosin\u2013Rammler\u2013Bennet equation. The results show that with the proportion increasing of the large balls, the specific surface area decreases, while the uniformity coefficient and the characteristic diameter increases.",

     "abstract": "Due to their high centrifugal acceleration tubular bowl centrifuges enable the separation and classification of fine particles. However, this type of centrifuge which is operated in a semi-continuous mode has a major disadvantage: sediment buildup in the rotor leads to a successive degradation of separation conditions over process time. In this study, a light scattering sensor was used to monitor this mechanism online by measuring the solids concentration in the overflow. Polyvinylchloride (low micrometer range) and fumed silica particles (nanometer range) served as experimental products. By incorporating the sensor signal in a control loop with the speed of the centrifuge, the mentioned drawback was compensated. As a result, grade efficiency and product loss were kept constant up to a high filling level of the rotor. It is outlined how this technology can be used for very demanding classification tasks, especially in case of fine, low-density materials.",

By controlling the Cu complexes based on the calculation of pH dependent metal complex concentrations in the aqueous solution and analyzing the redox potential of Cu complexes electrochemically, the relationships between Cu complexes formed at each pH and the size of Cu NPs were elucidated. Although the Cu\u2013citric acid complexes were expected to be the same in the pH range from 11 to 13, linear sweep voltammogram results strongly indicate that Cu\u2013citric acid complexes at pH 13 are quite different from those at pH 11 and 12. ESI\u2013TOFMS results represent that hydroxide ions bond to the Cu citrate acid complex at pH 13 and consequently (Cu2+)(C6H4 O 7 4 - )(OH\u2212)2 is formed. The Cu complex at pH 13 is easily reduced to Cu NPs compared with Cu\u2013citric acid complex formed at pH 11 and 12. As a result, the size of Cu NPs at pH 13 is smaller than that of Cu NPs at pH 11 and 12.

The effect of electrolyte concentration was analyzed by varying the concentration from 0.01 to 1.0\u00a0M, under constant electric power of 40\u00a0W. Results indicated that the applied voltage required for plasma generation increased with a decrease in the electrolyte concentration and the particle size decreased at high applied voltage with low electrolyte concentration; particles with a mean diameter of 258.5\u00a0nm formed at 0.05\u00a0M.

     "abstract": "Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) has various pharmacological effects. Our previous studies demonstrated that the oral bioavailability of ISL was low and the concentration-time profiles of ISL exhibited double peaks after oral administration in rat, but the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. The objective of this study was to clarify the gastrointestinal (GI) absorptive characteristics of ISL using in situ intestinal perfusion model as well as explain double peaks phenomenon after oral administration and to evaluate the potential of using nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) as an oral delivery carrier for poorly water soluble drugs. The results showed that the absorption percent in the stomach for 2\u00a0h was less than 10%, the absorption process of intestine was first-order process with passive diffusion mechanism, and the main absorptive segment was colon. Isoliquiritigenin-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier (ISL-NLC) could enhance oral absorption of ISL. The reason for the Double Peak Phenomenon following oral administration in ISL plasma concentrations versus time profiles is Variability of Absorption within different regions of the gut, very low absorption from the stomach, jejunum, duodenum and ileum compared with the absorption from the colon. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in rats after a single dose oral administration of ISL at 20\u00a0mg/kg in the form of either ISL-NLC or isoliquiritigenin solution (ISL-Sol). The AUC (0\u223c\u221e) values were 5.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.67\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0h\u00a0mL\u22121 and 29.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.88\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0h\u00a0mL\u22121 after administration of the ISL-Sol and ISL-NLC, respectively.

The influence of magnesium content, reaction temperature and macromolecules on the microstructure, crystallinity and solubility of Mg-n-HA were characterized using SEM, XRD, FTIR techniques and soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. The results showed that needle-like Mg-n-HA nanoparticle with Mg being successfully incorporated in HA lattice could be synthesized, and there was no obvious morphology difference among the Mg-n-HA nanoparticles synthesized under different conditions. However, the crystallite sizes, cell parameters and crystallinity evidently decreased with the increasing magnesium content, the lowering reaction temperature and the introducing of macromolecules. Moreover, the solubility in SBF soaking was greatly improved in comparison with n-HA due to their lower crystallinity.",

A calcium carbonate microcapsule with impregnated pyrene that is a water insoluble fluorescent molecule was soaked into suitable aqueous solutions to promote the phase transition of vaterite toward calcite as the stable phase of calcium carbonate. When 0.2\u00a0M calcium chloride solution was used, the largest amount of pyrene (approximately 0.06\u00a0wt%) was encapsulated into the calcite particle. Pyrene thus included was not eliminated even after thorough washing with THF. The calcite particle thus prepared produced the excimer emission of pyrene by UV irradiation. Rhodamine B was also introduced into calcium carbonate by the immersion of the microcapsule into the aqueous solutions of Rhodamine B. The fluorescence of rhodamine B was observed from the calcium carbonate particles by visible light irradiation. Acetaminophen, a common drug poorly soluble in water, was also included in the calcium carbonate particle by the same procedures as the pyrene encapsulation. As acetaminophen thus encapsulated was released by the dissolution of the calcium carbonate particle in acidic solution, the particle is expected to be applied for a dissolution-triggered drug delivery.",

     "abstract": "Nanomaterials of Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) such as Amorphous Calcium Carbonate (ACC) nanoparticles are highly demanded industrial products. These products are prepared in industrial scale, using pure CaCO3 natural resources such as pure carbonate rocks, cockle shells, corals, and pearls. Such natural resources could be consumed rapidly due to their excessive use in PCC industries. Therefore, the development of novel procedures to prepare nanoparticles of PCC using impure minerals is desirable. Herein, we report a simple, novel and economical method to synthesize poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) stabilized ACC nanoparticles using extensively distributed impure dolomitic marbles in place of natural pure CaCO3 raw materials. The yields of final ACC products are enhanced using a bubbling column which can produce small bubbles to improve bubbling efficiency. The average particle sizes of final calcium carbonate products are in the range 21\u201353\u00a0nm. The best conditions to produce ACC, among the conditions used in the proposed method, are temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C, pH of 4.5 and PAA concentration of 10\u22122\u00a0M. One or more crystalline phase(s) of PCC is associated with ACC in each product and its nature depends on the conditions used in the synthesis of these products. The unstable vaterite form of PCC is formed when the PAA concentration is less than 0.5\u00a0M and at lower temperatures such as room temperature. The stability of the vaterite phase decreases when the temperature and the PAA concentration are increased. The synthesized ACC nanoparticles are in required purity and quality to be suitable for industrial applications.",

Spherical and uniformly sized capsules were obtained under all conditions. Elemental analyses showed that the PNIPAM/alginate weight ratio increased with the increase of initial concentrations of NIPAM monomer and polymerization initiator and was proportional to the initial rate of polymerization. In addition, the thermoresponsive properties of IPN hydrogel capsule were measured at temperatures from 10\u00a0\u00b0C to 50\u00a0\u00b0C and the thermoresponsive volume change ratio was expressed as a function of the PNIPAM/alginate weight ratio raised to a power. From these results, the relationship between the experimental conditions and the amount of PNIPAM in the capsule shell was clarified, and it indicated the magnitude of volume change of IPN hydrogel capsules can be controlled by introducing the desired amount of PNIPAM in the capsules.",

The polymorph and morphology of CaCO3 particles were investigated by XRD and TEM, respectively, and the interaction between palmitic acid and CaCO3 particles was studied by FTIR. It reveals that the amount of palmitic acid does not change the crystalline phase of CaCO3 particles. However, the morphology of CaCO3, from nano-cubic single particle to micro rod-like aggregation, can be controlled by varying the amount of palmitic acid. The assemblage of CaCO3 particles is discussed from the view of the deformation of the micelle when it is absorbed on the Ca(OH)2 particles and of the aggregation of extremely small CaCO3 particles under the driving force of high surface energy.",

To measure the growth rate of struvite crystals and to identify its various dependence system parameters, laboratory measurements were conducted in an isothermal batch 1\u00a0l stirred seeded crystalliser. Supersaturation and pH have been found to be the most influential parameters for struvite crystallisation. It was found that growth rate increased with an increase in solution pH in the pH range of 8\u20139. The rate of change of ortho-phosphate concentration in the bulk solution increases with increasing supersaturation ratio. The growth rate increased with increase in temperature. Higher NaCl salt concentration and higher speed also produced higher struvite growth kinetics.

The kinetic rate constants were also calculated by fitting a first-order kinetic model and power law model to the experimental data obtained.

Recently aerosol therapy has become an attractive non-invasive way for systemic administration of biologically active components, because of the unique features of the lung, namely its large surface area, high permeability and wide blood supply. Success of a therapy depends on the effectiveness of particle delivery to a targeting site of the lungs.

It explains the method, including recent improvements, and refers to theoretical considerations as well as practical experience in controlling the main particle parameters determining the product properties, namely size and composition. The paper focusses on particles below 10\u00a0nm, where the spark method works best. Values for feasible production rates and energy efficiencies are estimated using published data. Spark mixing is identified as a feature that renders great potential to the method, especially for catalysis but also for other purposes, as it opens myriads of new possibilities in the form of material combinations. The most important condition for this potential to turn into industrial application is the capability of scaling up. The basic principles that allow mixing are treated, methods are reviewed and examples for applications are given. These include the creation of new phases that only exist in the nanoparticulate state. A new technique allowing an increase of the production rate of a single electrode pair by a factor of 102\u2013103 is introduced. It allows production nanoparticles typically 5\u00a0nm in size at a rate of 1\u00a0g/h, and this rate can arbitrarily be increased further by operating multiple sparks in parallel. The energy requirement is in the order of 3\u00a0kWh/g. The paper stems on adoption and interpretation of published articles as well as on new developments that are presented for the first time.",

     "abstract": "Gas-phase (aerosol) technology is used widely in manufacture of various nanostructured commodities at tons/hour today. So it is quite promising for synthesis of sophisticated nanoparticles motivating basic and applied research. Frequently such nanoparticles are made as clusters of primary particles (PPs) by chemical reaction, aerosol coagulation, sintering, surface growth and even fragmentation. When PPs are bonded by strong chemical forces, they are termed aggregates. As such they are sought in catalysis, lightguide preform manufacture and, most importantly, as components in electronic devices (sensors, batteries). When PPs and aggregates are held together by rather weak, physical forces, they form agglomerates. These are attractive in nanocomposites and fluid suspensions (paints, nanofluids, bioimaging). Such clusters may have also distinct health effects, beyond those of equivalent spherical particles.Agglomerates and aggregates are characterized by microscopy, electromagnetic scattering and mass mobility measurements in terms of their volume-equivalent radius, radius of gyration and/or mobility radii in the free molecular and continuum regimes along with the corresponding power laws (fractal dimension, Df). Coagulation and sintering largely determine nanoparticle structure. Coagulation of PPs leads to agglomerates of Df\u00a0=\u00a01.78 and 1.91 in the continuum and free-molecular regimes, respectively. The coagulation rate of agglomerates is higher than that of volume-equivalent spheres in the free molecular regime. Agglomerates attain also a self-preserving size distribution by coagulation facilitating process design for their manufacture. Mesoscale simulations elucidate the sintering (or coalescence) of agglomerates to aggregates and narrowing of their PP size distribution. Once agglomerates start to sinter, they follow a power law to aggregates and eventually to compact (spherical) particles, regardless of composition and initial PP size distribution. Aggregate properties are in-between those of the initial agglomerate and the fully coalesced sphere. Finally the stability of agglomerates under ultrasonication, stretching, fluid dispersion, impaction and capillary condensation is highlighted.",

Based on these concepts, a short overview is given about anion exchange of oxide nanoparticles and oxide-based nanocomposite formation.

The device allows a high sample throughput enabling full statistical evaluation of force\u2013deformation data of single microspheres. Existing theories describing the deformation behavior of single spheres are discussed and applied to the elastic and plastic deformation regime of silica microspheres. The results obtained from the theories are compared between each other and values reported in literature. The silica microspheres exhibit a significantly different deformation behavior than expected from bulk fused silica, i.e. a distinct plastic deformation behavior. Furthermore, a significant decrease in Young\u2019s modulus and hardness was observed caused by high porosity and reduced crosslinking of silicon atoms, respectively, that is inherent to silica produced by St\u00f6ber synthesis. However, the calculated contact pressures exceed the compressive strength of bulk fused silica by at least a factor of two as an effect of a reduced amount of material flaws in microstructures.",

Long-range defects due to particle orientation and anisotropic particle packing are also common in powder compacts, and are attributed to a shear stress field and/or a directional stress field during forming.

The development of monitoring and control systems for coating and granulation of particles is highly desirable, not only to allow the operation in a stable bubbling fluidization regime, which intensifies heat and mass transfer, but also to ensure strict quality specifications for products, such as, uniform particle size distribution, low moisture content and good flowability. This paper focuses on the discussion of methods used and results obtained in studies on monitoring and control of granulation and coating process in the fluidized bed reported in the literature in the last decades. Pressure fluctuation signal analysis is widely discussed as a tool of regime monitoring. To monitor particle size, techniques such as, Near Infrared spectroscopy (NIR), Focused Beam Reflectance Measurements (FBRMs), among others are presented in detail. As for moisture content tracking, the methods are reviewed like acoustic signals, capacitance, microwave resonance and spectroscopy.

In the initial stages of milling (up to 15\u00a0h) for the (Fe65Co35)90Cr10 powders, the saturation magnetization (Ms) decreased but further milling (up to 90\u00a0h) increased the Ms. However, the trend for coercivity was different and three stages were observed. An initial increasing stage (up to 15\u00a0h of milling), followed by a reducing middle stage (up to 60\u00a0h of milling) and then again an increasing final stage (up to 90\u00a0h milling).

The product of the microwave plasma had a smooth surface, whereas the product of the electric furnace had a cracked and rough surface. The cracks were regarded as the results of the poor diffusion of the dissociated water. In the microwave plasma, the high temperature and the fast heating rate enhanced the diffusion and controlled the formation of cracks. With the application of the thermal plasma, the nanoparticles were prepared due to the vaporization of the dehydrated material.

An iterative numerical procedure is therefore suggested to simulate the evolution of the graphite layer. The iterative process used to reproduce the layer build-up is decomposed as follows: Reynolds-Avergared Navier Stokes is employed to generate the flow field. The turbulent dispersion of the particles is reproduced through the use of a continuous random walk model. After statistically sufficient deposition of particulate matter, the layer build-up is computed using mechanics of dry granular material. The layer build-up model shows good agreement with data obtained from experimental tests carried out on-site.",

     "abstract": "Seeding methods; including rubbing, dip-coating and electro-phoretic deposition (EPD) were comparatively implemented for silicoalumino phosphate-34 (SAPO-34) thin film fabrication via secondary growth. The size of surface particles and thicknesses of fabricated layers were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The so-called properties were analyzed and modified to achieve a fairly defect free surface coverage and thin layers with finest particles. One-step dip-coating method provided well-distributed seeds on the support surface with a very poor coverage. Rubbing and EPD methods preferentially provided defect free and uniform surface coverage, however the grown particles from EPD method were bigger than those from rubbing method. It was revealed that in situ (no seeding) crystallization and one-step dip-coating method failed to produce defect free qualified membranes whereas EPD and rubbing methods caused continuous and defect free SAPO-34 membrane layers. To control synthesis parameters in the secondary growth crystallization, two important parameters were studied; crystallization time at three levels of 12, 24 and 48\u00a0h and crystallization temperature at three levels of 458, 473, and 488\u00a0K were simultaneously examined with the aforesaid seeding methods. Significant effects of crystallization temperature and time were observed on the formed layer qualities. The fabricated membrane by rubbing method during 24\u00a0h crystallization time at 473\u00a0K temperature was tested under equimolar gas mixture of hydrogen\u2013methane at 293\u00a0K with pressure drops ranging from 1 to 6\u00a0bar.

Pulsation in the inlet air flow was introduced using 0.1\u00a0Hz frequency square wave that controlled opening and closing of a solenoid valve. Transients of the total pressure-drop across the bed were carefully recorded using fast-response pressure transducers connected to a data acquisition system.

     "abstract": "The protein adsorption behavior onto sheet-like calcium hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (Hap) particles produced by microreactor was examined by using typical acidic bovine serum albumin (BSA) and basic lysozyme (LSZ). Since the sheet-like Hap particles were highly growth through b- (or a-) and c-axes, the particles had larger fraction of bc (or ac) crystal face. The saturated amounts of adsorbed BSA ( n s BSA ) for the sheet-like Hap nanoparticles were increased with increase in the particle size; i.e., n s BSA showed a good linear relationship with the total surface area of bc and ac faces of each particle. This result strongly suggested that the sheet-like Hap particles progressed in b- and c-axes with large fraction of C sites on bc and ac particle faces and exhibit a high selective adsorption of BSA. On the contrary, very few LSZ molecules adsorbed onto sheet-like Hap particles. Hence the present study developed that the amounts of adsorbed protein, especially for BSA, can be controlled optimally by altering the size of sheet-like Hap particles. It was also found that the sheet-like Hap particles can be applied to separate completely BSA molecules from BSA\u2013LSZ mixed solution.",

Both coated microparticles had similar physicochemical properties, but some differences in the drug dissolution behaviors of CC-DP-RS and CFC-DP-RS at lower coating levels were observed. That is, the coated microparticles prepared by CC showed faster release than that by CFC. As a result of dissolution study using Talc seal-coated microparticles and thermal study using differential scanning calorimeter, the rapid dissolution behaviors from CC-DP-RS at the lower coating levels of RS might be due to APAP migration to the coating film during coating due to the weak drying efficacy of the CC method.

The lattice constant hardly changed with increasing copper concentration while the crystallite size increases. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) indicate that the portion of Fe3+ ions at the tetrahedral sites move to the octahedral sites as some of the substituted Cu2+ ions get into the tetrahedral sites. The effect of Cu-substitution on the magnetic properties was studied through the temperature dependence of the molar magnetic susceptibility. The Curie temperatures (TC) were found to decrease with increasing the Cu concentration while molar magnetic susceptibilities remain constant.",

Elevated heating times led to an increase in crystallite size, and decrease in lattice parameter. Up to 20\u00a0min annealing, series 3 powders showed a decrease in microstrain 2.5 times more than series 2. The coercivity (HC) of 1-step milled and 60\u00a0min annealed Fe50Co50 alloys decreased rigorously from 60 Oe to 19\u00a0Oe due to strain relief (from 0.3% to 0.08%) and grain growth (from 30\u00a0nm to 40\u00a0nm). For series 2 alloys, the HC (up to 60\u00a0min heating) increased from 72 Oe to 90 Oe, and decreased (up to 100\u00a0min heating) to 70 Oe. Compared to series 1, extra milling treatment of series 2 causes an increase in magnetization saturation (MS) due to completion of alloying and grain refinement. Also, compared to series 2, extra annealing treatment for series 3 resulted in larger values of MS caused by stain relief.",

The first example among the patterns that have been extensively studied would be stripes; however, the formation of stripe patterns has so far been confined to partially or fully hydrophobic surfaces. By contrast, we have succeeded in preparing well-defined stripe patterns even on strongly hydrophilic substrates via a convective self-assembly technique. By using this technique, a stripe pattern was produced simply by suspending a substrate in a dilute suspension, without any complicated procedure; the stripes spontaneously aligned parallel to the contact line. Driven by this finding, we further investigate this self-assembly process, and find out that the convective self-assembly is quite promising as a template-free pattern formation technique. In the present paper, we first overview the convective self-assembly technique which is originally developed for uniform film formation, and then present our recent results on the pattern formation of colloidal particles through the convective self-assembly. This technique can produce various patterns including stripes, cluster arrays, and grids in response to macroscopic experimental parameters such as particle concentration and temperature.",

From the local pressure transient data, occurrences of key events of the collapse dynamics were identified. The first event is the zero pressure-drop condition soon after the flow interruption while the second is the global minimum on the pressure-drop profile that marks the end of the first stage of the bed collapse characterized by fast bed transients. The second stage is a relatively slow process, which ends with the onset of the zero pressure-drop condition again (third event) that reflects particles becoming stationary, thus signaling the completion of the collapse dynamics. The time of the first stage of the collapse is found to vary linearly with the initial fluidization velocity at which the collapse experiment was initiated whereas the total collapse time shows a rather weak dependence on the fluidization velocity. On the other hand, the velocity transients during the collapse follow first-order time lag that can be accurately modeled using a single time constant irrespective of the initial fluidization velocity.",

Polyethylene glycol (PEG), when attached to the surface of the nanoparticles, increases the biocompatibility of the nanoparticles. PEGylated nanocarriers evade the reticuloendothelial system (RES).

Furthermore, the use of linear representation of grids in PBMs to represent industrial granulation processes that span a wide granule size range is computationally prohibitive and results show that a non-linear grid representation is computationally more efficient with comparable accuracy. Parallelization of the PBM via a multi-core strategy has also been incorporated in order to reduce the simulation time of the model. Incorporating the cell average technique along with parallelization of the overall model lends credence to the overall use of the model for effective granulation process design and analysis.",

It is seen that with permittivity ratio larger than conductivity, droplet takes an oblate and for lower ratio takes prolate shape. It is seen that for relatively low Eotvos number where the surface tension is a dominant factor and for high Ohnesorge number where the viscosity plays an important role shear breakup occurs.

     "abstract": "Ti(IV)-substituted calcium hydroxyapatite (Ti-CaHap) microparticles were synthesized by hydrolyzing the phenyl phosphate (C6H5PO4H2) in a mixture of aqueous Ca(OH)2 and Ti(SO4)2 solutions at pH\u00a0=\u00a08 and 85\u00a0\u00b0C. Then, the atomic ratio Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti) in the starting solution was ranged from 0 to 0.20. The XRD pattern of the product formed at Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti)\u00a0=\u00a00 was identified as CaHap. On increasing Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti) ratio, the diffraction intensity of the CaHap peaks weakened and the unit-cell dimension c of the material was reduced. The Ti content in the particles was increased by raising Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti) ratio and the Ti(IV) was more easily incorporated in the particles than Ca(II). All the phenyl phosphates were hydrolyzed during preparation of the particles. The CaHap formed at Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti)\u00a0=\u00a00 was needle-like particles with the size of ca. 3.2\u00a0\u03bcm in length and ca. 0.3\u00a0\u03bcm in width. The size of Ti-CaHap particles was essentially unchanged on increasing Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti) ratio up to 0.05. At Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti)\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a00.10, the amorphous TiO2 particles with a size of ca. 90\u00a0nm were generated and the size of Ti-CaHap particles was decreased, leading to the steep increase of specific surface area. It can be, therefore, presumed that the Ti(IV) is substituted with Ca(II) in CaHap crystal to form Ti-CaHap microparticles at Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti)\u00a0=\u00a00\u20130.05, though the incorporation of Ti(IV) in the materials impedes the crystallization and growth of Ti-CaHap particles and accelerates the formation of amorphous TiO2 particles at Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti)\u00a0=\u00a00.10\u20130.20. Diffuse reflectance UV measurements indicated that the Ti-CaHap microparticles possess a UV absorption property and the ability is enhanced on increasing Ti/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Ti) ratio. The Beer\u2019s plot revealed that the UV absorption ability of the synthetic Ti-CaHap microparticles is higher than that of amorphous TiO2 ones.",

In stamp-charged coke making, the coal charge is compacted to one large cake before entering the coke oven. A coal cake density of approximately 80% of the coal solid density is needed to produce a high-quality coke. Also, sufficient mechanical strength is required when transferring the cake from the stamping machine to the oven. To gain insight into the densification process and cake structure a 2-dimensional computational model based on the discrete element method (DEM) was set up. The model was validated against force and displacement patterns from laboratory stamping tests. Stamper movement in response to cake properties could be reproduced. The approach also enables tracking of cake porosity, particle rearrangement, stress and strain rates, etc. This offers additional possibilities for studying the densification process and understanding mechanical strength development.",

     "abstract": "Corona charge spraying has been widely used in the powder coating application, thanks to its outstanding charging performance leading to high coating efficiency. Yet, this spraying technology has not been working very well with fine powders that started to be used by powder industry in recent years. Fine powders are known as the powders that have median sizes smaller than 30\u00a0\u03bcm. Utilizing fine powders can improve coating quality and reduce film thickness. However, it has been experienced that the fine powders have much lower first pass transfer efficiency (FPTE). This study provided a solution for the problem by humidifying the powder coating particles. The gained moisture on the particle surfaces can reduce the powder resistivity. As a result, the electric field strength inside the deposited particle layer on the target is reduced, allowing more charged particles to be deposited. Therefore the FPTE of the fine powder is increased. Discovered by the experiments, a maximum of 17% increase in the FPTE was achieved with the humidified fine powder. The improved FPTE of the fine powder was comparable to the regular powder. The study also evaluated the influence of the increased humidity on the fine powder flowability. Based on the results obtained from the powder characterization tests, the suggested humidification process would not significantly deteriorate the fine powder flowability.",

     "abstract": "A previously unknown partitioned fluidized bed gasifier (PtFBG) has been developed for improving coal gasification performance. The basic concept of the PtFBG is a fluidized bed divided into two parts, a gasifier and a combustor, by a partitioned wall. Char is burnt in the combustor and the generated heat is supplied to the gasifier along with the bed materials. During that time, highly concentrated CO2 is inevitably generated in the combustor. Therefore, vigorous solid mixing is an essential precondition as well as minimizing horizontal gas mixing. In this study, gas and solid mixing behaviors were verified in a cold model three partitioned fluidized bed (3-PtFB). Glass beads with an average diameter of 150\u00a0\u03bcm and a particle density of 2500\u00a0kg/m3 were used as bed materials. For the gas mixing experiments, CO2 and N2 were introduced into the beds through each distributor. Then, outlet gas flow rates and concentrations were measured by gas flow meters and an IR gas analyzer respectively. The calculated gas exchange ratios ranged from 3% to 10% with varying gas flow rates. For the solid mixing experiments, 1000\u00a0\u03bcm polypropylene particles with a density of 883\u00a0kg/m3 were continuously fed into the reactor. Then, the polypropylene particles were distributed to the entire beds evenly. Solid mixing behaviors were very analogous to liquid mixing behaviors in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR).",

We explore computationally the effect of the width of the tube, the density of the grains and the coefficient of restitution between the grains and the wall on the value of the saturation.

The use of this technique is essential for obtaining the target microstructure, which ensures the desired performance of the resulting material. Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steels were produced using MA based on the prealloyed grade Fe\u201320Cr\u20135Al and Fe\u201314Cr\u20135Al\u20133\u00a0W steels with the addition of Ti and Y2O3 as reinforcements.

Because the sprayed AISI 316L coatings include oxide layers synthesized in the air during the plasma spraying process, the oxide layers may restrict carbon diffusion. We found that the carbon content of the sprayed AISI 316L coatings by low-temperature carburizing was less than that of the AISI 316L steel plates; however, there was little difference in the thickness of the carburized layers. The Vickers hardness of the carburized AISI 316L spray coating was above 1000\u00a0HV and the amount of specific wear by dry sliding wear was improved by two orders of magnitude. We conclude that low-temperature plasma carburizing enabling the sprayed coatings to enhance the wear resistance to the level of carburized AISI 316L stainless steel plates.

This conductive ceramics (CCs) was fabricated by combination of gelcasting and high temperature reductive sintering (HTRS) in novel atmosphere. CNT pre-treatment leading to the increased hydrophilicity makes it possible to make uniformly dispersed CNT/alumina slurry. And by HTRS in Ar at 1700\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h, well-gelled polymer net-paths in green body prepared by gelcasting technology were totally converted to nano-carbon networks (NCNs) without destruction of CNT. NCN with graphitic crystal structure was evaluated by Raman spectroscopy in sintered ceramic body. Moreover, comparing with as-received CNT, the decreased surface defect of detected composite also supported the further graphitization of CNT via HTRS in Ar instead of burning out. With the aid of field-emission scanning electronic microscopy (FE-SEM) observation, the increased alumina grains in sintered ceramic body CNT/NCN/alumina was valid. Moreover, it was demonstrated that there were three components in this composite, which is carbon filler with two different forms (CNT and NCN) and alumina matrix.

     "abstract": "Selective catalytic reaction is a very efficient method to reduce NOx emissions from thermal power plants and is widely used in Japan. To develop a higher performance de-NOx system and optimize its maintenance schedule, it is important to understand the NOx reduction mechanism in the honeycomb channel which supports the de-NOx catalysts. In this study, the effects of duct channel flow behavior on the de-NOx reaction at the catalyst surface were investigated using a direct numerical simulation (DNS). The DNS computations were performed for three inflow conditions, one laminar and two turbulent. The results show that although the flow transitions from turbulent to laminar flow as the flow moves downstream for the turbulent inflow conditions, de-NOx reaction rates for the turbulent inflow conditions are higher than that for the laminar inflow condition even in the downstream region. This is because of the remaining cross-sectional fluid motions caused by the inflow turbulence. As a result, de-NOx efficiencies for the turbulent conditions are higher than that for the laminar case. For both laminar and turbulent inflow conditions, de-NOx reaction is suppressed in the corner regions due to the flow stagnation.",

Further, a build-up of internal pressure caused by the product gas may alter the reaction pathway in a way that favours one pathway over others. Two well-known cases of this kind of reaction are the thermal decomposition of limestone and gibbsite, in which carbon dioxide and water vapour are the produced gases, respectively. A multi-stage, multi-reaction, shrinking core model is proposed for the simulation of this type of process. The model emphasises the role of the produced gas, not only in mass transfer, but also in the reaction kinetics. It includes parallel and series reactions, allowing for the formation of an intermediate species. The model has been applied to the conversion of gibbsite to alumina, including the formation of intermediate boehmite. Modelling results for gibbsite conversion, boehmite formation and its subsequent consumption, as well as alumina formation, agree well with literature data; the corresponding kinetic parameters are estimated for all reactions. Significantly, the experimentally-observed plateaux in the particle\u2019s temperature history are predicted by the model. The role of heating rate and particle size on boehmite formation is also evaluated using the model, and is in agreement with observation.",

The effect of fine/coarse particles ratio on the mechanical strength was also investigated using siliceous goethitic ore. The failure strength of the pellets under different drying conditions was measured and the time taken for the pellets to disintegrate under saturated (soaking) and leaching conditions was recorded. The results showed that, with the same type of nickel laterite, the time taken to disintegration during leaching test is proportional to the pellets tensile strength. Pellets with water as binder are more stable under soak conditions. Furthermore, failure strength for oven dried pellets is greater than that of air dried. With saprolitic nickel laterite (SAP) pellets, their mechanical strength and re-wetting stability can be enhanced by drying the wet pellets or by increasing the binder content in the pellets. The pellets mechanical strength was found to be a good indication of their stability under leaching conditions as well.

The column leaching performance of agglomerates of the same ores was also investigated. Both single pellet and column leaching tests showed that the ore mineralogy played a major role in the Ni extraction rate, with G-type of ore the lowest. The Ni extraction rate was also found to be directly related to the pellet/agglomerate dryness and the highest rate was obtained at an intermediate degree of dryness due to the better wetting and diffusion of acidic lixiviant into the pores in between the particles. However, no significant effect of drying on the stability of the agglomerates (measured by agglomerate slump in the column) was found in column leaching. For G type of ore, mixing it with high clay ores during agglomeration is recommended to enhance its robustness during leaching process.",

In the absence of a strong colloidal attractive force, the maximum loading is determined by the packing density of the particles which in turn is a function of the particle size distribution. In this study, coal fractions of different mean sizes with a narrow distribution were separated by sieving. Mixtures of different mean coarse to fine size ratios were then prepared. For each size ratio, different amounts of coarse particle contents were prepared. With these different mixtures, water was added to produce the CWSF. The maximum volume packing density, \u03c6max, for each mixture was determined using a rheological vane yield stress technique. The determination of \u03c6max involving the direct yield stress measurements of extremely high concentration suspensions is an entirely new and accurate approach. It was found that the highest \u03c6max was obtained when the coarse to fine ratio was \u223c10 located at a coarse coal content of 70\u00a0wt%. This result is consistent with that obtained by theoretical modelling of bimodal mixing of monodisperse size spheres with a size ratio of 10.

     "abstract": "One method to reduce the energy consumption of industrial milk spray dryers is to recover waste heat from the exhaust dryer air. A significant challenge associated with this opportunity is the air contains a small amount of powder that may deposit on the face and surfaces of a recuperator.

The fin bank acts like the face of a typical finned tube row in a recuperator. The aim of this study is to look at how deposition on the front of fins is affected by the air conditions. Results show similar characteristics to other milk powder deposition studies that exhibit a dramatic increase in deposition once critical stickiness levels are reached. As powder deposits on the face of the fins, the pressure drop across the bank increases until eventually an asymptote occurs, at which point the rates of deposition and removal are similar. For very sticky conditions, deposition on the face of the fins can cause a rise in the pressure drop by as much as 65%. The pressure drop has also been successfully related to the percentage of open frontal area of the fins with and without deposition. Deposition inside and at the rear of the fin bank was found to be minimal.",

     "abstract": "Discrete Element Method computer simulations have been carried out to analyse the influence of the hydrophobic force model on the capture of particles by a central bubble. Two hundred particles, with diameters ranging between 24 and 66\u00a0\u03bcm, were randomly positioned within a maximum distance from the surface of a bubble of 2\u00a0mm in diameter. Initial particle velocities were random in direction and value and they followed Gaussian distributions with standard deviations between 0.0 and 1.0\u00a0m/s. Three possible models, named A, B and C have been used in the simulations. The models correspond to different published relationships of the hydrophobic force with the distance between particle and bubble surfaces, d. Model A corresponds to a hydrophobic force that decays in the form 1/d; the hydrophobic force given by Model B uses a relationship in the form 1/d2; Model C predicts a force that decays in an exponential way in the form exp(\u2212d/\u03bb). These models have also been compared with a base case in which the hydrophobic force only acted when the particles were in contact with the bubble. Therefore, we could better discern between the influence of the initial particle velocities and the long range component of the hydrophobic force. The differences in the capture efficiency of the particles predicted by the three models were drastic. All particles were captured by the bubble in the cases simulated using Model A for any particle\u2013bubble surface distance smaller than 1\u00a0mm. However, only 40% and 60% of the particles were captured even for particles located at distances of less than 50\u00a0\u03bcm from the bubble surface in the cases simulated using Models B and C (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcm), respectively. In fact, the capture of particles seems to be more strongly influenced by how the hydrophobic force decays with interparticle distance in the range of tens of micrometres rather than by the differences between the models in the range of micrometres. Therefore, this work should aid in the future determination of a general hydrophobic force model through an experimental comparison of the kinetics of collision of particles against bubbles in flotation cells with the simulation results.",

Changes in the surface chemistry/speciation are also investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and EDTA extraction technique. The oxygen demand test shows that the different pyrite ores display significantly different electrochemical reactivity. Furthermore, continuous aeration of the pulp reduces the reactivity of the pyrite ores. Solution and surface analysis results suggest the formation of hydroxide surface coatings on the pyrite surface as aeration progresses, preventing or minimising further oxidative reactions from taking place in the pulp.

It was found that the presence of SDS in the mixed aqueous solution was an important parameter for the morphology and size of nesquehonite crystals. The morphology of nesquehonite crystals changed from rod-like to bundle-like with increasing SDS concentration. The average length of nesquehonite whiskers was about 87\u2013180\u00a0\u03bcm while the aspect ratio was 18\u201345.

The LiFePO4/C composite prepared under the optimal conditions exhibits an initial room temperature discharge capacity of 150.2\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121 at a 0.2\u00a0C rate and a constant discharge capacity of about 105.7\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121 at a 20.0\u00a0C rate after 50 cycles, showing promising potential as a novel cathode material for lithium ion batteries.",

First, SiO2 nanoparticles were grafted with silicone chains by a controlled wet chemical sol\u2013gel-type reaction with the reactive oligomers. The solvent of the resulting solution was evaporated to form a viscous suspension, casted into a film, and finally heat-treated at 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 150\u00a0\u00b0C. A hydrolysis and condensation reaction among silicone-grafted SiO2 nanoparticles and free silicone oligomers in the final heat treatment resulted to produce free-standing, roll-able, and transparent silicone-based polymer film. The fact that the silicone film cannot be synthesized without the presence of SiO2 nanoparticles suggests that these nanoparticles act as cross-linking agents of silicone components providing the improved mechanical properties to the composite film. The rate-controlled mixing and heating of the SiO2 aqueous/alcohol suspension and the silicone oligomer/alcohol solution was found to be the key step in the synthesis of the free-standing transparent film. While rapid addition/mixing resulted in a fragile and opaque film, a transparent material was achieved when those solutions were slowly mixed. The effect of the synthesis process on the macroscopic and microscopic properties of the prepared films is discussed along with their formation mechanism.",

Water is an attractive solvent particularly for inexpensive inorganic precursors (e.g. metal nitrates) as it can effectively reduce the process cost. Furthermore when water usage is combined with a carbon-free fuel (e.g. H2), nanoparticles can be made without forming CO2. Here such a FASP process is explored for synthesis of Bi2O3 and other oxide nanoparticles from aqueous precursor solutions. The flame temperature was measured by FTIR emission\u2013transmission spectroscopy while powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction and N2 adsorption. At low FASP fuel gas (H2 or C2H2) flow rates or process temperatures, product powders had a bimodal crystal size distribution. Its large and small modes were made by droplet- and gas-to-particle conversion, respectively. Homogeneous Bi2O3 and CeO2 powders were obtained for sufficiently high flow rates of either C2H2 or H2. Prolonged high temperature residence times promoted precursor evaporation from the spray droplets and yielded homogeneous nanostructured powders by gas-to-particle conversion. In contrast, FASP of aqueous solutions of aluminum nitrate yielded rather large particles by droplet-to-particle conversion at all fuel flows investigated.",

These free flowing spray dried granules on subsequent compaction processing results in the powder compacts with high densities and strength. The spray dried granules were evaluated for their flow properties in terms of cohesion index, compaction coefficient, powder flow speed dependency and caking properties using a powder flow analyzer attached to a texture analyzer. Spray-dried granules exhibited the cohesive index value of \u223c6.5 compared to a value of 16 for the commercially available powder. It is observed that a good correlation can be elucidated with respect to the powder particle size, surface area and morphology.

Although the polarization characteristics of lead recorded from these two electrolytes were relatively similar to each other, the shape of formed dendrites strongly depended on the type of electrolyte. The dendrites composed of stalk and weak developed primary branches (the primary (P) type) were predominantly formed from the basic electrolyte. On the other hand, the very branchy dendrites composed of stalk and of both primary and secondary branches (the secondary (S) type) were mainly electrodeposited from the complex electrolyte. Considering the fact that the application of lead powder in many technologies is closely related with its surface morphology, the special attention was given to the analysis of the type of electrolytes on formation of the different dendritic forms. It was shown that formation of more branchy dendrites from the acetate electrolyte can be ascribed to the lower exchange current density (or to the lower rate of electrochemical process) for this electrolyte than for the nitrate one due to the process of complex formation.",

     "abstract": "A continuous separator based on float\u2013sink density separation using a gas\u2013solid fluidized bed dense medium was used to upgrade iron ore. The separator has three devices for (A) conveying floaters, (B) recovering floaters, and (C) conveying and recovering sinkers. The optimum speeds of these devices were investigated using density adjusted spheres of the diameter\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0mm in the range of 2400\u20133300\u00a0kg/m3 in density increments of 100\u00a0kg/m3. A mixture of zircon sand and iron powder was used as the fluidized medium to adjust the fluidized bed density to produce a separation density\u00a0=\u00a02850\u00a0kg/m3, a typical separation density for lump iron ore wet separation. The recovery of the spheres as floaters or sinkers depended on the speed of the devices, because the recovery was affected by the number density of spheres directly under the feeder, the local fluidized bed density, and flow currents in the medium derived from the movement of the devices. The optimum speeds were determined to be 3.5\u00a0cm/s for (A), 2.0\u00a0rpm for (B) and 1.0\u00a0cm/s for (C), respectively. Continuous separation experiments were conducted on lump iron ore particles in the size range of +11.1\u201331.5\u00a0mm in the fluidized bed with medium density of 2850\u00a0kg/m3 and feed rate of 200\u00a0kg/h. Comparison of the feed rate and the recovery rate indicated that the feed and the recovery were in equilibrium after 10\u00a0min of operation. The experiments resulted in nearly perfect separation; 98.4% of the ore with density greater than 2850\u00a0kg/m3 was recovered. The Fe, Al and Si content of the feed ore particles (before the separation) and the floaters and sinkers (after the separation) was measured using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. The separator produced an upgrade in iron content of 3.3\u00a0wt% and reduced the Al and Si content by 44%.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents a numerical investigation of solid separation in jigging device. Jigging is a gravity separation method commonly used by the minerals industry to separate coal, iron ore, diamonds and other minerals on the basis of particle size and/or density. Separation is recognised as being heavily dependent on fluid motion in the jig. This study explores the effects of the inlet time dependent velocity profile in relation to a wide criterion on jigging performance. Modelling of the liquid\u2013solid system is performed through a combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate liquid flow and discrete element method (DEM) to resolve particle motion. The initial packing conditions consist of a binary-density particle system of 1130 particles each 1\u00a0cm in diameter. A range of jigging profiles have been implemented in mineral processing. In this study the sinusoidal pulsation profile is selected adopting variations in both amplitude and frequency. The performance of profile variants are compared in terms of solid flow patterns, separation kinetics, energy, and mean particle position. These quantitative comparisons demonstrate significant differences in the segregation rate, energy, and solid phenomena, helping find an alternative optimum operating setting for the system. In addition, boundaries of operation are found in terms of frequency and amplitude limits and the concentration mechanics are investigated in these regions.",

     "abstract": "A newly developed mechanochemical process for the simple aqueous phase synthesis of crystalline magnetite nanoparticles has been experimentally investigated. In this process, a suspension of ferric hydroxide precursor is milled at room temperature using a horizontal tumbling ball mill consisting of a stainless steel pot and balls. Ferric hydroxide is transformed to magnetite without the use of a reducing agent. As a model starting material for the investigation, a pH-adjusted suspension of crystalline goethite was used. As the milling time increased, goethite disappeared along with the simultaneous formation of magnetite. A single phase of magnetite was obtained after 16\u00a0h of milling. A reaction mechanism for the formation of magnetite has been proposed based on oxidation\u2013reduction reactions, in which the corrosion of iron in the pot and balls plays an important role. Free electrons are generated by the release of ferrous ions from the stainless steel in an anodic reaction, which then reduce goethite to ferrous hydroxide in a cathodic reaction. The solid phase reaction between ferrous hydroxide and goethite produces magnetite. Not only could the mechanochemical effect induced by the collision of balls accelerate the corrosion even under alkaline conditions, it can also promote the formation and crystallization of magnetite.",

     "abstract": "A novel method for directly measuring the temperature history of mobile hot ferromagnetic particles (steel particles), substituting for reacting particles, in a binary-solid (reacting particles and inert particles) downflow is introduced. The temperature history of the hot steel particles can be obtained by measuring the temperature of the particles at different axial positions using magnetic fields that can separate the steel particles from other bed materials immediately and easily. Employing the magnetic marking method, magnetic sensors were used to detect the change in magnetic flux density in a given magnetic field, and the residence time of the steel particles was also measured. The cross-sectional averaged particle-to-bed heat transfer coefficients were calculated from the experimental results using simple heat balance equations. The measured temperature data have a relatively wide error range; however, the average temperature curves derived from the average particle-to-bed heat transfer coefficients agreed with the temperature plots. Therefore, the experimental method of this study is applicable to the measurement of the particle temperature in a binary-solid downflow. The results showed that there is strong correlation between the particle-to-bed heat transfer coefficients and normalized collision frequency under the laminar gas flow conditions.",

However, many challenges remain, including quantification of the mixing that occurs during discharge through the hopper. We have formulated a model based on the conservation of volume of the powder and a semi-empirical expression for velocity profile, (see [1], [2]), and used this to estimate mixing parameters. We have specifically considered the case of an inflow which is disposed in homogeneous horizontal layers as it enters the storage bin. When the powder, in successive layers, enters the hopper, it accelerates and its velocity along the longitudinal axis of the hopper is greater than at the walls. Portions of layers high in the hopper may overtake layers closer to the exit resulting in mixing of the layers. Using this model we are able to quantify the percentage of each layer in a given output volume and present results for typical hopper geometries.",

The results show that it is impractical to remove arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) from downstream processes by using selective flotation. It was observed that 22% of total Sb and 31.1% of As remained in the final tailings. In this case, 24% of gold was recovered in the initial stage of flotation. On the contrary, in the bulk method of flotation, which was aimed at maximizing the gold (Au) recovery, the maximum Au recovery of 90.6% obtained after 60\u00a0min of flotation at the grind size with d80 of 146\u00a0\u03bcm.

     "abstract": "Magnesium ammonium phosphate (MgNH4PO4\u00b76H2O:MAP) releases approximately 70% of its ammonia at a mild temperature of 378\u00a0K. The resultant material (magnesium hydrogen phosphate (MgHPO4:MHP)-like material), which appears to be an amorphous phase, to remove ammonia from wastewater was investigated. Because the original size of MAP crystals was found to critically affect the kinetics of ammonia uptake by the corresponding MHP-like material, MAP with different sizes were synthesized by changing concentration, pH and temperature of the synthesis solution. The variation in the synthesis concentration was found to change the size of MAP as well as the aspect ratio of the long-axis to the short-axis. The rate of ammonia uptake depends primarily on the dimension of the short-axis of the corresponding MAP crystals. Furthermore, analysis of ammonia uptake using a method similar to the shrinking-core model shows approximately 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm from the surface is effectively used for ammonia uptake over a period of a realistic process time. Thus, the results suggest it is crucial to synthesize small MAP crystals with the size of short-axis less than 1\u00a0\u03bcm. Our results also show that small MAP crystals can be used at least four times repeatedly for ammonia uptake.",

The ore particles were put into a cylindrical column of inner diameter of 100\u00a0mm and bed height of 50\u00a0mm, and were fluidized at a given air velocity u0/umf\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u20133.2 for 10 min. u0 and umf are the superficial air velocity and the minimum fluidization air velocity, respectively. The bulk density of the ore particles after fluidization was measured as a function of height through the bed in 5\u00a0mm increments (the 50\u00a0mm height was divided into 10 layers) to investigate the density-segregation. The size of the particles in each of the 10 layers was also measured to investigate size-segregation. It was found that both density-segregation and size-segregation occurred as a function of height through the bed after fluidization at u0/umf\u00a0=\u00a02.0. However, the segregation did not occur near the bottom of the bed for lower u0/umf and did not occur near the top of the bed for larger u0/umf. The origin of the segregation-dependence on the air velocity was discussed considering the air bubbles size and the fluidizing intensity at upper and lower sections of the bed. The Fe content of the 10 layers at u0/umf\u00a0=\u00a02.0 was measured to calculate the Fe-grade and Fe-recovery.

The main and admixed particles were mixed using a mortar and pestle for 5\u00a0min for various mass ratios. SEM images were used to analyse the coverage diameter and the surface coverage ratio. As a result, the packing fractions with admixed particles of 8 and 21\u00a0nm were larger than when admixed particles were not used, and these admixed particles adhered onto the surface of the main particles as agglomerates. However, packing fractions of 62 and 104\u00a0nm were almost constant and were independent of the coverage states of admixed particles. Furthermore, these admixed particles with relatively larger diameters were adhered onto the surface as single particles. From the coverage diameter and actual surface coverage ratio obtained by the SEM image, the average gaps between agglomerates of 8 and 21\u00a0nm on the main particle were calculated. When the gap approached twice the size of the coverage diameter, packing fractions of 8 and 21\u00a0nm proved to be the maximum values.

We also investigated the effect of the sampling size (30\u00a0g vs 1\u00a0g) on the stochastic homogeneity of 2% (w/w) salicylic acid blends with an automatic sampling device.The fill level has only a slight effect on the mixing performances of the mixer with 30\u00a0g samples. Moreover the different target concentrations were obtained in a single blending step in less than 6\u00a0min. Most of the related RSD were beneath 7%. A smaller sample size of 1\u00a0g showed a greater variation in the limits of \u00b110% of the target value.This mixer is a good alternative to most batch mixers used at the time in the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, as assumed, we confirmed the crucial impact of the scale of scrutiny.",

Via this approach, results clearly show the qualitative validity of the PBM as a tool to capture the dynamics of the process that affect API composition, RSD and RTD. The model also demonstrates the use of the PBM as an overall multi-scale modeling tool to combine micro-level models such as DEM in a hybrid framework. Due to the relative computational simplicity of solving the PBM (as compared to DEM), the developed model can be used effectively in control and optimization of the mixing process.",

The produced structure was isothermally heat-treated at 500\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C for 0.5\u20132\u00a0h under argon atmosphere. In order to evaluate the structural changes during milling and annealing, the synthesized powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Moreover, the powder morphological changes were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that the reaction between Al and V2O5 occurred after about 30\u00a0min and, the Al3V and Al2O3 were formed in nanocrystalline structure with the continuing mechanical milling. Calculation of adiabatic temperature confirmed that reaction took place in combustion mode. In final stage of milling up to 40\u00a0h; it was observed that the Al3V decomposed to Al and V so that the optimum time of milling to achieve fabrication of nanocomposite was determined to be about 20\u00a0h. Calculations based on Miedema\u2019s model verified partial disordering of Al3V during further milling and annealing of as-milled powder at 600\u00a0\u00b0C led to the ordering of Al3V.

In this study, dry granular flows are modeled utilizing a set of equations akin to a two-phase mixture system, in which the interstitial fluid is air. The resultant system of equations for a two-dimensional configuration includes two continuity and two momentum balance equations for the two respective constituents. The density variation is described considering the phenomenon of air entrainment/extrusion at the flow surface, where the entrainment rate is assumed to be dependent on the divergent or convergent behavior of the solid constituent. The density difference between the two constituents is extremely large, so, as a consequence scaling analysis reveals that the flow behavior is dominated by the solid species, yielding small relative velocities between the two constituents. A non-oscillatory central (NOC) scheme with total variation diminishing (TVD) limiters is implemented. Three numerical examples are investigated: the first being related to the flow behaviors on a horizontal plane with an unstable initial condition; the second example is devoted to simulating a dam-break problem with respect to different initial conditions; and in the third one investigates the behavior of a finite mass of granular material flowing down an inclined plane. The key features and the capability of the equations to model the behavior are illustrated in these numerical examples.",

The structure and morphology of the product were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that as-prepared product was crystallized in pure cubic NbC phase and the size of the sample was estimated to be around 120\u00a0nm. The Rietveld refinement of the XRD data gives the cell constant a\u00a0=\u00a04.4718\u00a0\u00c5. According to the Scherrer formula, the real grain size was about 70\u00a0nm. The BET surface area of the sample was ca.29.3\u00a0m2/g. The grain size distribution of the sample was about 467\u00a0nm, which was characterized by N4 PLUS submicron Particle Size Analyzer.

Overexposure to respirable rock dust can be a serious health hazard to roadheader operators and other workers. One of the rock roadways, named North Belt Main Entry (NBME), belonging to the underground coal mine Zhuxianzhuang, located in east China, is being driven by the EBZ318H roadheader. The cross-section of the roadway is 15.84\u00a0m2, and the heading face has a high concentration of respirable rock dust.This paper presents a study of rock roadheader dust control by foam, taking into account the dust generation characteristics. A new foam preparation system and application method has been proposed and the dust suppression effect of foam has been assessed by dust concentration measurements taken at two points next to the roadheader operator in the previously mentioned underground coal mine.The results have shown that the foam dramatically reduced the rock dust concentrations. The roadheader operator\u2019s respirable dust exposures were lowed from 540.2\u00a0mg/m3 to 84.3\u00a0mg/m3, and the dust suppression efficiency reached 84.4% on the NBME heading face. In addition, the visibility and environment of the heading face was significantly improved.

As part of an exposure assessment, we characterized the following carbonaceous nanomaterials, using an aerosol carbon monitor: nine samples of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), a sample of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), a standard sample of diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), and an ambient particulate matter (APM). The amounts of elemental carbon (EC) determined by the monitor coincided with the mass of MWCNTs calibrated by a microbalance. The carbonaceous nanomaterials were oxidized in three steps of oven temperatures (550, 700 and 920\u00a0\u00b0C) in this method. The portion of oxidized carbon at each temperature depended on the sample characteristic. We used the monitor to analyze the aerosol samples collected in five stages by a Sioutas cascade impactor (SCI), which collects size-segregated airborne particles having aerodynamic diameters from 6.6\u00a0\u03bcm to less than 0.25\u00a0\u03bcm. As MWCNTs aggregate/agglomerate easily, the size was of a good parameter to distinguish the MWCNTs from other materials. Two-dimensional mapping by size and oxidized temperature suggested the origin of the carbonaceous aerosol samples. Based on the results, we reanalyzed our previous data obtained at a factory manufacturing MWCNTs. The characteristics of workplace samples by particle size and carbon analysis were similar to those of MWCNT aerosol particles.",

This working electrode was designed and fabricated by inserting a PEDOT:PSS film between a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate and a layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 particles (P-25). This study also examines the effects of annealing temperature and duration on the transmittance and microstructure of a PEDOT:PSS film as well as the power conversion efficiency of DSSC with this film. The power conversion efficiency of a DSSC with a PEDOT:PSS film (6.37%) substantially exceeds that of a conventional DSSC (4.24%). This result is attributed to the fact that this transparent and conductive PEDOT:PSS film deposited on the FTO glass substrate using a simple spin coating method substantially improves the short-circuit photocurrent per unit area and the fill factor of DSSC.",

The shape and average size of these SrWO4 microcrystals were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, we have investigated the PC activity of microcrystals for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) dyes. XRD patterns, Rietveld refinement data and FT-Raman spectroscopy confirmed that SrWO4 microcrystals have a scheelite-type tetragonal structure without deleterious phases. FT-Raman spectra exhibited 12 Raman-active modes in a range from 50 to 1000\u00a0cm\u22121.

Based on these FE-SEM/TEM images, a crystal growth mechanism was proposed and discussed in details in this work.

The conveying system consisted of a powder discharge vessel and a horizontal rectangular channel at the side of the vessel. The air velocities at the bottom of the vessel and the horizontal channel were changed experimentally. The powder was glass beads that are Geldart A particles, with a mean diameter of 53\u00a0\u03bcm, a particle density of 2523\u00a0kg/m3 and a minimum fluidizing velocity of 4.329\u00a0mm/s. We measured the mass of the transported powder, the bed height of the powder in the vessel, the air pressures at the bottom of the vessel and the horizontal channel, and the flow pattern during powder conveying. Sufficient powder conveying could not be obtained when air was not supplied to the bottom of the vessel. On the other hand, the powder could be transported smoothly when air was supplied to the bottom of the vessel and the air velocity at the bottom of the horizontal channel exceeded the minimum fluidizing velocity. In this case, the powder was discharged smoothly from the vessel to the horizontal channel, and then the powder flowed easily toward the exit of the horizontal channel. The mass flow rate of the powder was in proportion to the falling velocity of the powder in the vessel, where that velocity was related to the discharge of the powder from the vessel. Therefore, it is found that the discharge of the powder from the vessel had significant effect on the horizontal conveying of fluidized powder in this system.",

The temperature of the PFC added to the emulsion did not significantly affect the size and the morphology of the MAO microspheres. The size of the MAO microspheres increased with increasing preparation temperature. The main reason for the increased size of the MAO microspheres was the increased coalescence with increasing preparation temperature.

     "abstract": "Over recent years there has been increasing interest in continuous powder mixing processes, due mainly to the development of on-line measurement techniques. However, our understanding of these processes remains limited, particularly with regard to their flow and mixing dynamics. In the present work, we study the behaviour of a pilot-scale continuous mixer during transitory regimes, in terms of hold-up weight and outflow changes. We present and discuss experimental results concerning the start-up dynamics of a Gericke GCM 500 mixer, for which a specific experimental protocol has been developed to determine the evolution of the hold-up in the mixer and the real outflow. Empirical relationships are derived so as to link hold-up weight variations with operating conditions. A simple stochastic approach, based on a non-homogeneous Markov chain, is developed to simulate the bulk particle flow and transport in the continuous mixer at a macroscopic level. Although this simple model is only based on the start-up behaviour, it provides a full description of the mixer dynamics in response to strong perturbations on the flow rate or on the rotational speed of the stirring device, such as negative or positive steps. This model is validated experimentally for a wide range of operating conditions, and constitutes a first approach to process control.",

     "abstract": "Segregation of two ternary powder mixtures at filling and at discharge of a 0.4\u00a0m3 cylindrical silo has been investigated experimentally. The material distribution at silo filling was determined by sampling from the upper layers of the heap at different radial positions and with varying levels of fill. Discharge flow patterns were elaborated with tracer objects in the majority of experiments and the composition of the bulk solids during emptying was determined by sampling across the entire discharge stream. The effects of free fall distance and intermittent discharge and filling on segregation at filling as well as the effect of hopper angle on segregation at discharge were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of filling rate is discussed. Based on the results, side-to-side segregation with accumulation of fine particles to the silo walls clearly increases with increasing free fall distance. Segregation is also aggravated in situations where the silo is filled and discharged intermittently, because the shape of the powder bed\u2019s surface changes when a portion of the silo contents is withdrawn. The effect of filling rate remains unclear and should be more deeply investigated in the future. The hopper angle determines the discharge flow pattern, i.e., funnel or mass flow, but the composition of the powder mixture towards the end of complete emptying is mainly determined by the material distribution at the levels of fill that are withdrawn last. The presented findings increase the understanding of the effect of process parameters and silo design on segregation, and can be used for mitigating the detrimental effects of segregation of bulk solids handled in silos.",

The reaction is performed at dry phase [1], [2] by mixing two classes of particles during the fluidisation: target particles to be treated (MP Silica 63\u2013200 Active 6\u00a0\u00c5) and ODTCS-carrier particles consisting of coarser porous alumina beads (300\u2013800\u00a0\u03bcm) containing an adequate amount of reagent.The aim of this work was to study the effect of the temperature (from 30 to 110\u00a0\u00b0C) at dry condition on the silanisation reaction rate and the silica surface characteristics. The hydrophobisation treatment is characterized by IR/ATR, Washburn method, elementary analyses and RMN.The experimental results show that the reaction rate increases with temperature in dry environment but this effect seems to be more significant at lower temperatures. Also, the quantity of reagents can be estimated by measuring the amount of HCl generated by the reaction using a pH sensor.

In measuring a current per unit mass, for Dp,50\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a0206\u00a0\u03bcm at the branch pipe section the current has a positive value as expected by the contact potential difference between glass beads and stainless-steel.

In measuring a specific-charge by the Faraday cage, the specific-charge has a negative highest value at the ejector. The negative specific-charge decreases along the particle flow direction. Therefore, an \u201cunusual\u201d charge-transfer, which couldn\u2019t be explained solely by the contact potential difference, was confirmed also by the Faraday cage. Although the charge-transfer between the beads and the inclined stainless plate with high impact speed has been examined, the sign of the current is positive for all data.

An negative current in air by using a stainless steel needle detected at the ejector for Dp,50\u00a0=\u00a051\u00a0\u03bcm while an positive current in air detected at the branch and straight pipe. The reason is suggested that the ion balance in the air does not keep between the ejector and the branch pipe due to both the adsorption of some negative ions on the pipe wall and the decrement of negative charge of particles. Therefore the \u201cunusual\u201d charge-transfer consists of not only the ionization caused by the self-discharge but also an adsorption of ions on the inner wall of the pipe.",

HAp powders derived from the solution-type precursor material were Ca-deficient, and their Ca/P molar ratio increased with bed temperature.

     "abstract": "The discrete element method (DEM) is widely used to comprehend complicated phenomena such as gas\u2013solid flows. This is because the DEM enables us to investigate the characteristics of the granular flow at the particle level. The DEM is a Lagrangian approach where each individual particle is calculated based on Newton\u2019s second law of motion. However, it is difficult to use the DEM to model industrial powder processes, where over a billion particles are dealt with, because the calculation cost becomes too expensive when the number of particles is huge. To solve this issue, we have developed a coarse grain model to simulate the non-cohesive particle behavior in large-scale powder systems. The coarse grain particle represents a group of original particles. Accordingly, the coarse grain model makes it possible to perform the simulations by using a smaller number of calculated particles than are physically present. As might be expected, handling of fine particles involving cohesive force is often required in industry. In the present study, we evolved the coarse grain model to simulate these fine particles. Numerical simulations were performed to show the adequacy of this model in a fluidized bed, which is a typical gas\u2013solid flow situation. The results obtained from our model and for the original particle systems were compared in terms of the transient change of the bed height and pressure drop. The new model can simulate the original particle behavior accurately.",

Zeta potential measurements were used to evaluate colloidal stability of nanoparticles in aqueous media. The mechanism of fluorosilane adsorption on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles was investigated using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and turbidimetric technique.The characterization results revealed that the amorphous fluorosilane adsorbs on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles in both neutral (pH 6) and alkaline (pH 11) solutions. The values of the band gap energy for all treated nanoparticles were almost the same, in the range of 3.10\u20133.18\u00a0eV. Zeta potential measurements showed that isoelectric point of the TiO2 nanoparticles shifts from 6.8 for untreated TiO2 to 4.4 for treated one. Based on the zeta potential measurement results, it is expected that treated TiO2 nanoparticles in neutral or alkaline conditions have higher colloidal stability and better dispersion in the aqueous solutions.

The aggregation process of colloidal particles was simulated using the discrete element model (DEM) combined with the well-known DLVO theory. The predicted aggregate structural characteristics, namely the coordination number and inter-particle forces were then used in a modified version of the Flatt and Bowen mechanistic model [6] to calculate the corresponding suspension yield stress. The effect of key parameters such as solid volume fraction, suspension pH and ionic strength on the aggregate structure and hence the yield stress of the suspension was investigated.The results showed that the yield stress increased significantly under conditions that were favourable for formation of complex net-like aggregate structures, such as high solid volume fractions, pH values near the iso-electric point, and high ionic strengths. In such cases, the mean coordination number reached a maximum value which was considered to be dependent on the particle size and size distribution. The suspension yield stress exhibited a power law dependency on the solid volume fraction. The interconnected network structure developed at high solid volume fractions was found to be the major contributing factor to the observed high suspension yield stress. As the particle\u2013particle repulsion became significant, a decrease in both the number of bonds and the mechanical bonding strength of the aggregate structure was observed. That was considered to be responsible for the reduction in the suspension yield stress. The suspension yield stress became independent of the suspension ionic strength when the ionic strength exceeded the critical coagulation concentration. Satisfactory agreements were obtained between simulation results and the published experimental data.",

Accounting for the solid\u2013liquid interaction is critical for accurate predictions of these systems. Therefore, a careful selection of models for turbulence and drag is required. In this study, the effect of drag model was studied. The Eulerian\u2013Eulerian multiphase model is used to simulate the solid suspension in stirred tanks. Multiple reference frame (MRF) approach is used to simulate the impeller rotation in a fully baffled tank. Simulations are conducted using commercial CFD solver ANSYS Fluent 12.1. The CFD simulations are conducted for concentration 1% and 7% v/v and the impeller speeds above the \u201cjust suspension speed\u201d. It is observed that high turbulence can increase the drag coefficient as high as forty times when compared with a still fluid. The drag force was modified to account for the increase in drag at high turbulent intensities. The modified drag is a function of particle diameter to Kolmogorov length scale ratio, which, on a volume averaged basis, was found to be around 13 in the cases simulated. The modified drag law was found to be useful to simulate the low solids holdup in stirred tanks. The predictions in terms of velocity profiles and the solids distribution are found to be in reasonable agreement with the literature experimental data. Turbulent kinetic energy, homogeneity and cloud height in the stirred tanks are studied and discussed in the paper. The presence of solids resulted in dampening of turbulence and the maximum deviation was observed in the impeller plane. The cloud height and homogeneity were found to increase with an increase in impeller speed. The work provides an insight into the solid liquid flow in stirred tanks.",

The flow properties of the binary mixtures of the different ibuprofen particles and its binary mixtures with lactose were measured using a Schulze\u00ae RST-XS ring shear tester. Results show that the morphology of ibuprofen was changed from needle to hexagonal like crystals during recrystallization and crystal size was reduced dramatically by HSWM for 1\u00a0h. The flowability of milled ibuprofen powders is reduced significantly due to its reduced size and change of surface morphology. Mixing the HSWM ibuprofen powders with lactose enhanced its flow properties. However, the increase of the mixture flowability for HSWM ibuprofen is less significant in comparison to the binary mixtures of lactose with commercial ibuprofen.",

Conformational structures and intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the adsorbed malic acids obtained via MM2 modeling were used to explain the surface forces operating in the dispersions. We found that the yield stress-pH behaviour is almost identical for d-, l- and racemate malic acids. At low surface coverage of adsorbed malic acid, the maximum yield stress was reduced by as much as 55%. At complete surface coverage the reduction decreased to \u223c40%. MM2 modeling showed the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and the (free) charged carboxylate group within the malic acid molecule. Intra-molecular hydrogen bonding and the high number of strongly bound water molecules (hydration number of malic di-ionic species) were likely responsible for the di-ionic malic acid species acting as a very effective steric agent. At complete surface coverage, the inter-molecular hydrogen bond formed between the layers of adsorbed malic acid, is responsible for the small rise in the maximum yield stress. Racemate malic acid produced a smaller maximum yield stress at complete surface coverage compared to the pure enantiomers. This may be related to the two different types of hydrogen bonds found in the racemate. Only one type is found in the pure enantiomers.",

PROX catalytic activities in a H2-rich stream were tested and compared using ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles supported on two different nanotubularly structured materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and halloysite nanotubes (HNTs). In both of the support materials the morphology remains unchanged after Ru deposition and reduction, demonstrating that their tubular structure is thermally-stable. The catalytic results show that the Ru/HNTs perform better than Ru/CNTs at temperatures below about 110\u00a0\u00b0C, owing to the easier reducibility of Ru particles over the former than the latter. However, Ru/HNTs can only reach a maximum CO conversion of 55%, with an O2 selectivity of around 27% applying an O2/CO mole ratio\u00a0=\u00a01 at 123\u00a0\u00b0C, which is insufficient for PROX applications. CNTs, on the other hand, provide larger surface area and have functional groups with stronger interaction with Ru nanoparticles, presenting a better Ru dispersion, which accounts for the superior catalytic activity at higher reaction temperature. Ru/CNTs catalyst exhibits a CO conversion over 90% and O2 selectivity of around 50% applying the same O2/CO mole ratio at temperatures above 120\u00a0\u00b0C.",

Leaching tests were also conducted on single pellet with irrigation of sulphuric acid solution from the top of the pellet. The leached out solutions were collected and nickel recoveries were analysed. The time taken for the pellets to disintegrate during leaching test was also recorded. It was found that the mechanical strength of the pellets was directly related to their dryness, with completely dried pellets having much higher strength. The dry pellet strength was found to increase with increasing binder content and decreasing pellet porosity. The time taken for the pellets to disintegrate during leaching test increased with increasing pellet strength. In comparison to sulphuric acid solution-bound pellets at the same condition, water-bound pellets exhibited higher mechanical strength. Although the nickel leaching rate for water-bound pellets was low at the beginning of the leaching test, the pellets lasted for more than 200\u00a0h without disintegration, with 70% of nickel recovered.",

This study presents the analysis of the influence of Hamaker constant, Brownian forces and particle concentration on the aggregation time of nanoparticles in high ionic strength suspensions. Particle adhesion and cohesion were simulated using the van der Waals force equation. Half the particles were assigned a Hamaker constant of 9.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221220\u00a0J and the other half of the particles had the Hamaker constant varied from case to case with values between 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221220 and 9.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221220\u00a0J. Aggregation times obtained from analysing the number of interparticle contacts and number of singlets in the suspensions have been used to characterise the speed of the aggregation process. The simulation results show that when the strength of the van der Waals interaction increases the aggregation time decreases following a power law. In addition, the presence of Brownian forces speeds up the aggregation process. Finally, the relationship between packing fraction and aggregation times for singlets and contacts has been very well expressed by power laws.",

     "abstract": "Fluidised beds are characterised by excellent thermal and chemical uniformity and have a wide application range including heat and surface treatment, ore roasting and catalyst production. However, compared to other gas-based systems, to fluidise a particulate mass, a significant quantity of gas is required. To conserve gas there is potential to operate the fluid bed under low-pressure conditions. It is also observed that heat transfer remains constant with reduction in pressure. The present work has numerically studied the nature of hydrodynamics in fluidised bed at sub-atmospheric conditions and a new drag law is proposed to account for the increased mean free path of the fluid. A wide range of sub-atmospheric pressures were considered such that slip flow regime, which is characterised with Kn\u00a0\u223c\u00a01, is applicable. An open source code (MFIX) is used to numerically solve the multiphase problem of a jet in the fluidised bed column with an immersed surface at vacuum pressure conditions. Bubbling fluidisation in shallow and deep beds are also solved. The new drag model takes into consideration the effect of slip flow to model drag force on the particles and the results of velocity distributions in the column and around the submerged surface is presented. The results of velocity distributions from the slip flow model are compared with the existing Gidaspow\u2019s model. Significant differences were observed in the simulation results of velocity distributions and flow structure in the fluidised bed under vacuum conditions.",

     "abstract": "Froth stability plays a major role in determining the mineral grade and recovery in flotation operations, and it depends on the type and amount of both frother and suspended particles. Furthermore, there are other parameters such as quality of the process water which may affect the froth stability. In plant practice, the recycling of process water instead of using fresh water is increasingly being common. However, using recycled water normally leads to building up salts and surfactants in solution. Therefore, the effect of the process water chemistry on froth stability and metallurgical performance is important. In this study, the effect of water quality, including pH, and type and concentration of salts (CaCl2, AlCl3 and NaCl) on froth stability and its relationship with mineral particles zeta potential and slurry viscosity was studied. It was found that the forth stability is higher in the presence of multivalent metal ions. Addition of CaCl2 and AlCl3 considerably increased both froth stability and pulp viscosity. This may be due to bridging effect of polyvalent metal ions between the ore particles.",

     "abstract": "There is a considerable challenge in accurate characterisation of gold (Au) particles in low-grade plant ore mineral samples. This is particularly true for automated mineralogical tools such as X-ray micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), where the need for statistically meaningful numbers of particles requires many sections to be analysed. Whiles the Vertical Gas Stream (VGS) elutriator is suitable for coarse particle upgrading (i.e. >38\u00a0\u03bcm), the performance is poor for finer particles (i.e. <38\u00a0\u03bcm). Consequently, the system has been modified to Vertical Water Stream (VWS) elutriator using higher density fluid (i.e. water) to enable analysis of Au particles below 38\u00a0\u03bcm. In this work, the VGS system was used to upgrade Au particles in the \u221253\u00a0+\u00a038\u00a0\u03bcm size fraction (in rougher concentrate, rougher tailings, regrind mill discharge and regrind cyclone underflow) and the VWS system was used to upgrade Au particles in the \u221238\u00a0\u03bcm size fraction of the regrind mill discharge sample. The VWS elutriator was calibrated using galena (specific gravity, S.G. of 7.58) and quartz (S.G. of 2.65) particles of <38\u00a0\u03bcm size as model minerals. From the calibration tests, partition curves as a function of particle size were generated. Using these measurements, theoretical partition curves for Au (S.G. of 19.3) have been calculated. The VWS concentrate was characterised using Micro-CT and compared with SEM coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of \u221253\u00a0+\u00a038\u00a0\u03bcm ore size fraction of the VGS concentrate of the four sample streams. The Micro-CT analysis of VWS Au concentrate showed that sufficient particles (Au) can be upgraded. SEM/EDX results indicate that regrind does not affect changes in free Au particle morphology, aspect ratio and frequency of shearing damage in the \u221253\u00a0+\u00a038\u00a0\u03bcm size fraction. Cyclone classification of the regrind mill discharge in the \u221253\u00a0+\u00a038\u00a0\u03bcm size fraction appears to perform surface cleaning by exposing obscuring silver (Ag) surfaces on Au particles in the mill discharge sample.",

The automation of the two main measuring steps enables characterisation of a large number of crystals ensuring statistically meaningful results. As part of the numerical algorithm, a rectangularity-based morphological filter was implemented to eliminate overlapping crystals and crystal networks. The developed optical sizing technique has a low detection limit of 0.25\u00a0\u03bcm, which is close to the theoretical resolution of optical microscopy. It is demonstrated that the new automated SOIA sizing technique is very sensitive in identifying oxalate crystals of different shape. The measured crystal size distributions are compared to those obtained by an AccuSizer sizing instrument to confirm that they are consistent with the measurements obtained by a conventional crystal sizing instrument.",

     "abstract": "This paper describes the measurement of size distribution of TiO2 fine particles in a highly concentrated non-aqueous suspension by using self-assembly of particles under an electric field. Interactive force apparatus (IFA) was used to conduct the measurement. IFA first assembled pearl chains of particles between two electrodes, and then applied the compressive force to change the pearl chain structure by shortening the distance between electrodes. The repulsive force generated when the chain curved while the attractive force created when the chain was broken. The cycle of repulsive and attractive forces corresponds to the size of particles. The results obtained with IFA were compared with results obtained from size measurement by analyzing SEM photographs. IFA indicated the comparable results with the one obtained using SEM. The particle size distribution measured by IFA decreased as a result of increasing the supply voltages. Changes in correlation between size distribution measured by SEM and IFA at different supply voltages were observed in different size ranges. At smaller than 300\u00a0nm, result at 0.24\u00a0V fit well with the SEM result while at >600\u00a0nm gives better agreement with the results at 0.48\u00a0V. The difference is mainly due to the increase in number of particles in fine size fraction with increasing supply voltages. Decrease in size indicated that the breakage of aggregate particles and/or disintegration of doublet particles occurred due to the electrical fragmentation. The fragmentation was explained by monitoring the mean diameters and their deviation obtained from IFA measurements at different supply voltages.",

The structural changes of powder particles during mechanical alloying were studied by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and microhardness measurements.

     "abstract": "Engineers working on the field of agriculture, food- or pharmaceutical industry or in the architecture frequently meet problems arising from the special properties of granular assemblies. Storing large amount of particulate raw materials is mostly made by using large containers, called silos. The design of such large silos is far not an easy problem. The outflow properties are one of the most important parameters of silo design. The constant discharge rate of silos differs from the discharge rate of containers filled with liquids. In case of fluids, the flowing velocity and discharge rate changes with fluid level. In case of granular materials, the velocity is constant (independent of the filling level of silo). There are methods used for the determination of silo discharge rate, but these are mostly experimental without physical explanation of the phenomenon. In this paper we demonstrate that the constant discharge rate is caused by the formation and collapse of arches in the bin. Based on this assumption, we derive an equation for determining the discharge rate. Using the same arching hypothesis we derive the equations describing the velocity distribution at silo outlets. The usability of our new approach is demonstrated by experimental investigations.",

Three groups of natural sand samples (diameter of 300\u2013500, 100\u2013125 and 63\u201380\u00a0\u03bcm) were employed in the experiments. Consecutive instants of saltating particles were recorded by using a high-speed digital camera at 2000 frames per second and a constant-temperature hot-wire anemometer was used to measure the turbulent fluctuation simultaneously. The particle concentration in the saltation layer was calculated by the dynamic-threshold binarization algorithm. The results confirm that the concentration fluctuation is a fairly typical stochastic process, and the low-frequency variation of particle concentration is closely related to the turbulent fluctuation. Moreover, a method was developed to apply wavelet packet transform to two-phase data analysis from the viewpoint of frequency-domain energy structure. Further analysis shows that the concentration fluctuation is predominant in the low frequency band less than 250\u00a0Hz. In addition, the particle concentration response to the turbulent fluctuation is significantly correlated with the particle diameter. For the fine particles (63\u201380\u00a0\u03bcm), medium particles (100\u2013125\u00a0\u03bcm) and coarse particles (300\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcm), the highest response frequencies of particle concentration variation to the turbulent fluctuation are 60, 40 and 30\u00a0Hz, respectively, which demonstrates that an appropriate sampling rate is crucial in saltation measurement.

     "abstract": "A simple surfactant-free electrochemical method is proposed for the preparation of magnetite nanoparticles using iron as the anode and plain water as the electrolyte. This study observed the effects of certain parameters on the formation of magnetite nanoparticles and their mechanism in the system, including the role of OH\u2212 ions, the distance between electrodes and current density. We found that OH\u2212 ions play an important role in the formation of magnetite nanoparticles. Particle size can be controlled by adjusting the current density and the distance between electrodes. Particle size increases by increasing the current density and by decreasing the distance between electrodes. Particle formation cannot be favored when the distance between electrodes is larger than a critical value. The magnetite nanoparticles produced by this method are nearly spherical with a mean size ranging from 10 to 30\u00a0nm depending on the experimental conditions. They exhibit ferromagnetic properties with a coercivity ranging from 140 to 295 Oe and a saturation magnetization ranging from 60 to 70\u00a0emu\u00a0g\u22121, which is lower than that of the corresponding bulk Fe3O4 (92\u00a0emu\u00a0g\u22121).

The mechanism of the reaction was dealt using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and thermodynamics calculations. It was found that Co3O4 reacts with Al through a self-sustaining combustion reaction after an incubation period of 50\u00a0min and the reaction between Co3O4 and Al involves two steps. First, Co3O4 reacts with Al to form CoO and Al2O3 at the temperature around melting point of Al, and at higher temperature, CoO reacts with remaining Al to form Co and Al2O3. Mechanical activation process decreases the reaction temperature from 1041\u00a0\u00b0C for as-received Co3O4 and Al powder mixture to 869\u00a0\u00b0C for 45\u00a0min milled powders.

The following results were obtained from this investigation: (I) the sticking problem of fine particles in angular pitch screw was solved by changing the pitch shape to circular; (II) the distribution of the fluctuations and their intensity in mass flow rates also lessen by using the circular pitch and a thin blade screw in place of the circular pitch and a thick blade screw. Also for both feeders, the feeding was often interrupted in low flow rates, but it will be disappeared by increasing the flow rate.

     "abstract": "A soft-sphere discrete particle model based on re-arrangement of the gas phase governing equations has been developed to investigate the formation of a single bubble due to a central jet pulse in two-dimensional coarse-particle fluidized beds. A comprehensive study is made on the influence of bed width, particle properties and jet velocity on the bubble characteristics. The bubble grows heterogeneously when its diameter reaches one third of the bed width and elongates rapidly when its transverse size exceeds about one half of the bed width. At a given superficial velocity, a bed with a larger width leads to a decrease of gas leakage of the bubble. The influence of particle density and particle size on the bubble characteristics can be considered as the effect of the minimum fluidization velocity, which is consistent with the results obtained by two-fluid model in literature. In the presence of wall restrictions, bubble grows into an egg shape rather than an elliptical shape at detachment time when the superficial velocity is higher than the minimum fluidization velocity. Besides, a thin layer in dilute regime is observed near the top of the bed at a larger jet velocity. A bed of finer particles tends to form this layer more easily.",

Commonly, rather simplified models are used like the approximation of primary particle interaction (APPI), which just considers the interaction of the closest pair of primary particles having a double layer as if they were isolated. However, for nanoparticles the double layer thickness may be in the same order of magnitude as the particle size or even larger, what leads to a considerable double layer overlap inside the aggregates and between two interacting aggregates. Consequently, such approximations will fail. The paper presents a numerical scheme for the double layer interaction of arbitrarily shaped aggregates, which can e.g. help to establish criteria for the applicability of approximate models. The calculation employs a singularity method, which is based on the linearised Poisson\u2013Boltzmann equation. Additionally, a linear model for charge regulation is implemented. The impact of charge regulation and double layer thickness were studied for fractal DLCA aggregates and hexagonal closed-packed aggregates.",

This paper investigates the influence of the process conditions (mixing intensity, cooling profile, batch time, saturation temperature and seeding) on the granulometric properties of pentaerythritol obtained by batch cooling crystallization.

The effect of the molar ratio and holding time on the phase evolution was studied by X-ray diffraction. The products were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy observations and particle size measurements.For a composition with a molar ratio of TiO2:H3BO3:C\u00a0=\u00a01:2.4:5 heated for 1\u00a0h, the simultaneous presence of TiC and TiB2 phases at 1100\u00a0\u00b0C and the transformation of TiO2 to Ti2O3 at 1200\u00a0\u00b0C and higher confirms that TiB2 synthesis is based on a TiC formation mechanism, in which TiC may be formed from a reaction between TiO2 or Ti2O3 and carbon. Then TiC may react with liquid B2O3 and/or gaseous B2O2 to form the TiB2 phase. The reaction is completed at 1500\u00a0\u00b0C. Also by increasing the molar ratio of boric acid to 3, the impurities decreased considerably and pressing of the material had an obvious effect on decreasing the impurities, due to an increase of the surface contact of particles, which causes an effective inhibition of boron escape from the reaction chamber.

An increase in fill volume (bed depth) at constant wall temperature and speed resulted in a decline in the drying rate. The rotational speed had a nominal impact on drying of glass beads.

The results indicated that for cylindrical dies at lower feed shoe speed, the center area had the highest pressures; at higher speed, pressure distribution was irregular, complicated, and varied more. One reason for this was relatively low bulk density and small particle size of the powder, which led to relatively poor flowability. For E-shaped dies, due to wider opening of the middle leg, its pressures were higher than those of the other legs. Compared to another powder (BPM) with denser, bigger, and less spherical particles, the alumina powder had the highest final pressures closer to the middle leg, instead of being closer to the back as for the BPM.

Antimicrobial effect of nanosilver shapes for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) was investigated using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. The growth of Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria were inhibited by nanosilver shapes. With BET technique, it was found that surface area of nanosilver shapes are key factor for controlling antimicrobial activity inside of the S. aureus and E. coli bacteria. Anti-bacterial activity of nanosilver shapes was found to be dependent on the shape and size of silver particles. Also, the Ag-NPls did show the best surface area and antimicrobial activity for the test organisms. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), indicated that, the most strains of S. aureus and E. coli were damaged and extensively disappeared by addition of Ag-NPls.",

From statistical analysis, the coating quantity appears to have a predominant effect on the resistance to attrition of the coated particle in these studied ranges of variables.

The interaction coating thickness \u2013 coating formulation, the interaction between the fluid bed temperature and the coating formulation and the coating formulation as well as the interaction costing thickness \u2013 fluid bed temperature were found to be very significant.

It was found that a simple device for flow restrictor is effective in making ZnO particles of terapod-shape by leaving sufficient amounts of unreacted Zn vapor with the embryos of ZnO. In the absence of the flow restrictor, only spherical particles are formed because the oxidation reaction takes place immediately after mixing and unreacted Zn vapor does not remain for the subsequent crystal growth. The Zn vapor concentration distribution, oxygen concentration distribution, temperature, gas velocity and reaction rate in the reactor were analyzed by using a conventional computational fluid dynamic simulation package. The simulation revealed that the flow restrictor does not enhance mixing between Zn vapor and air but suppresses the mixing and reduces the residence time in the reactor so that sufficient amounts of unreacted Zn vapor remain downstream of the flow restrictor, allowing ZnO particles to grow in tetrapod-shape by abnormal crystal growth.",

Previous researches on symmetric and 5-lobe models for rat, dog, hamster and human show that, the deposition fraction of fine particles (between 0.1 and 0.7\u00a0\u03bcm) is minimum. A multi-path asymmetric 5-lobe model of Horsfield et al. is employed to construct the airway tree. Since the data are based on lung casting, asymmetric properties of the model are more realistic. Deposition of 0.01\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm particles is calculated during inhalation using published formulas in every branch. Here, we measured the deposition up to alveolar region. Accumulative deposition versus particle diameter predicts less deposition in comparison with symmetric models in as much as our model is asymmetric. The flow is divided based on distal volume. Particle deposition for 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm is in good agreement with other models but for 1\u00a0\u03bcm different trend in lower generations is observed. It is concluded that the asymmetric pattern gives different deposition fraction in all regions, since the distinctive geometric properties of the model is in some extent different from that of symmetric model.

     "abstract": "This paper investigates numerically and experimentally the performance of a single stage wire-duct electrostatic precipitators (WDEP) as influenced by different geometrical and operating parameters. To numerically solve the governing equations, namely Poisson\u2019s and the current continuity equations, the finite element method (FEM) and a modified method of characteristics (MMC) were used. One major advantage of the present work over those reported in the literature is that the characteristic lines follow the FE grid pattern which results in fast convergence and reduction of the computational time. To verify the results experimentally, a proto-type WDEP was successfully designed and fabricated at the research institute of KFUPM (RI-KFUPM). The experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions and a smoke of fired coal was used as a source of seed particles of PM10 category (around 78% of particles lying below 10\u00a0\u03bcm). The results show how different parameters (such as discharging wire radii\u2019s, wire-to-wire spacing and wire-to-plate spacing as well as the fly ash flow speed and applied voltage polarity) influenced the corona power loss and current density profiles. An indication of the effectiveness of this approach was carried out through a comparison of previously computed results and previously as well presently obtained experimental data.",

These particles were isolated from the mother liquor and then coated with cobalt basic carbonate. The coating trials involved heating of the aqueous dispersions, containing known amounts of the dispersed copper oxalate particles (cores), urea, and cobalt nitrate, at 70\u201385\u00a0\u00b0C for various periods of time with constant stirring. The heating process decomposed urea, increased pH, liberated carbonate ions, which resulted in the precipitation of the dissolved cobalt ions in the form of shells of cobalt basic carbonate around each core particle. The coating process was sensitive to the applied experimental parameters, since uniformly coated particles were obtained under a narrow range of coating mixture composition. In the absence of the cores, the same reactants solutions produced coating precursor particles (cobalt basic carbonate), when subjected to similar heating conditions. Physical and chemical analyses indicated that the coating material of the coated particles and the coating precursor particles had the same chemical compositions. The as-prepared core, coating precursor, and coated particles were converted into oxide forms by heating their dry powders at elevated temperatures under controlled heating conditions. The heat treatment produced obvious changes in the surface morphology of these particles due to loss of material. Moreover, the heat-treated particles preserved shape integrity to a maximum extent, showing their thermal stability. Selected batches of the as-prepared and heat-treated products were characterized by various physical methods.",

The influence of air and oxygen on crystallite morphology was studied using TEM. It was confirmed from TEM analysis that the crystallites were nearly spherical in powder prepared in the presence of compressed air. In the presence of pure oxygen, the crystallites could acquire regular hexagonal shape. Complete hexagonal shapes may be due to sufficient (100%) supply of pure oxygen during the process of formation of ZnO nanocrystallite. The powder with regular shaped crystallites could be highly pure and also stoichiometric in nature. Pure oxygen could therefore be more advantageous as carrier than air for production of nanocrystalline ZnO powder. The effect of aerosol carriers (compressed air and pure oxygen) on crystallite morphology of nanocrystalline ZnO powders is reported in this article.",

The basal spacing value of the NaMt increased from 12.01 to 18.1\u00a0\u00c5 by pillaring with Keggin ions ((hydroxyaluminum polycation) and until 21\u00a0\u00c5 by intercalation of the cationic surfactant in the interlayer space of the clay.

Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the thermal decomposition of montmorillonites modified with the cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) takes place in four steps. The surface areas of organo-montmorillonites were found to be much lower than that of raw montmorillonite. Surface areas of pillared and acid-activated montmorillonite are very high. This was explained by the emergence of the micropores and mesopores in the structure of the sample resulting from treatment. Adsorption of the 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP) onto samples was studied. The greatest value of adsorption capacity of samples is attributed to the organo-montmorillonite (MtC16).",

Our research group demonstrated a good solution to diminish stagnant zones in MGBF during the filtration process. However, there still remain some systematic problems that have to be worked out prior to commercializing a whole facility.The design of the gas inlet component of the granular bed filter is important for achieving a uniform gas distribution and higher usage rate of the filter media. Non-uniformity may lead to a lower usage rate. The new gas inlet component design uses baffle devices in order to achieve a more uniform gas velocity distribution. Fixed bed and moving bed conditions were studied. The uniformity of the gas velocity distribution can be characterized by the standard deviation definitions and the differences in the mean velocities between the two filtration surfaces. The baffle lengths and angles affected the uniformity of gas velocity in inlet and filtration surfaces. The optimal experimental parameters were found by using different baffle lengths, angles and mass flow rate of filter media. The uniform gas velocity distributions were obtained by a series experiments. Furthermore, the results give important information about IGCC system that will be helpful for designing better models of moving granular bed filters in the future.",

FLR or M06 were added to the PLH\u2013GLC aqueous mixture prepared by adding distilled water at 60\u00a0\u00b0C to a melted mixture of PLH/GLC (1/1) at a PLH\u2013GLC/carrier ratio of 1/1 or 1/17. Spray-dried FLR microparticles have the PLH\u2013GLC solid dispersion (SD) in their pores and spray-dried M06 microparticles have the PLH\u2013GLC SD on their surface. The dissolutions of PLH from the spray-dried FLR (SD/FLR\u00a0=\u00a01/1), spray-dried M06 (SD/M06\u00a0=\u00a01/1), and spray-dried M06 (SD/M06\u00a0=\u00a01/17) microparticles in Tween 80 aqueous solution were markedly fast. The transport of PLH from the spray-dried FLR (SD/FLR\u00a0=\u00a01/1) across Caco-2 monolayers was hardly observed. The transport of PLH across Caco-2 monolayers from the spray-dried M06 (SD/M06\u00a0=\u00a01/17) increased with time, and the transport was significantly higher compared to that from PLH powder. The addition of polyethylene glycol 1500 into GLC of the spray-dried M06 was effective to increase the transport of PLH across Caco-2 monolayers. Spray-dried microparticles of PLH using GLC and M06 are a feasible means of enhancing transport across Caco-2 monolayers.",

Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the reaction between Al and Ni2O3 could occur spontaneously due to its negative Gibbs free energy. The reaction characteristic was discussed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) method and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The results showed that the reactions of the Al\u2013Ni2O3 system consisted of two steps as following: (1) the Al firstly reacted with Ni2O3 to form the stable \u03b1-Al2O3 particles and active Ni atoms; (2) the active Ni atoms further reacted with Al to form Ni2Al3. The values of activation energy of the two step reactions were around 457.3 and 282.4\u00a0kJ/mol, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) revealed that the Ni2Al3 blocks were uniformly distributed throughout the matrix, while the \u03b1-Al2O3 particles were slightly segregated in the matrix. The strength of the composite is controlled by the strength of Ni2Al3 phase, and the tensile strength and the elongation rate of the composite with 30\u00a0vol.% reinforcement volume fraction are 210\u00a0MPa and 8%, respectively.",

For several kinds of zinc salts, say Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O, Zn(CH3COO)2\u00b72H2O, ZnSO4\u00b77H2O or ZnCl2, the k1 are 0.057, 0.054, 0.054 and 0.094\u00a0min\u22121, respectively, and accordingly, the values of k2 are 0.413, 0.357, 0.116 and 0.025\u00a0min\u22121.

The addition of APTMS increased the pH value of TiO2 nanoparticle suspension due to the presence of the amine group and largely affected to the reacted amount of hydrophobic silanes. Next, relationships between the reacted amounts of silanes and their dispersion stability in various organic solvents were then investigated. Surface-modified TiO2 nanoparticles were re-dispersible into low-polar solvents such as hexane, toluene, and THF when the reacted amount of hydrophobic silane was relatively high; however, TiO2 nanoparticles were re-dispersible in highly polar solvents when the reacted amount of hydrophilic silanes increased.

The interaction term between gas and particle turbulence is fully taken into account by the transport equation of two-phase stress correlation. Hydrodynamics of high density particle flow, measured by Wang et al. [27] are predicted and the simulated results are in good agreement with experimental data. On the conditions of considering the realistic energy dissipation due to frictional stress, particle concentration and particle axial averaged velocity are closely the measured and they are better than without frictional stress model. Furthermore, the particle Reynolds stress is redistributed and the particle temperature is reduced. Effect of frictional stress leads to increase obviously the collision frequency at the outlet and inlet regions and the magnitude of frequency of particle collisions is 102.",

For this purpose, firstly, eight different mono-size fractions between 1.7\u00a0mm and 0.106\u00a0mm formed by a \u221a2 sieve series were obtained.

To verify the chemical stability between candidate ceramics and K0.5Na0.5NbO3, the prepared candidate ceramic bulks were embedded by the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 powder, they were annealed at 1100\u00a0\u00b0C, and then the interface regions between candidate ceramics and K0.5Na0.5NbO3 were investigated using Secondary Electron Microscopy (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). From these experimental results, BaTiO3, SrTiO3, Ba(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3, KNbO3 and NaTaO3 were found to be not appropriate for the templates for the tailoring of K0.5Na0.5NbO3, while the NaNbO3 and KTaO3 showed a good crystallographic coherency and a chemical stability with K0.5Na0.5NbO3.",

The influence of the tilt angle and surface roughness on the particle deposition rate were investigated. The results show that, using the v2-f model predicts the rate of deposition with reasonable accuracy. It is observed that in high relaxation time the effect of lift force on the particle deposition is very important. It is also indicated that decreasing the tilt angle from 90\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 enhances the deposition rate especially for large size particles. Furthermore, the results show that increasing the Reynolds number at a specific tilt angle decreases the rate of particle deposition and the tilt angle has insignificant impact on the particle deposition rate in high shear velocity or high Reynolds number.",

Tests by grinding in a planetary mill have been done to investigate the effects of mechanical activation and other surface changes. The reactivity towards HCl and CO2 has been determined as a function of grinding variables. Prolonged dry milling of olivine resulted in highly aggregated products, which were more reactive with respect to dissolution in acid than their respective BET surface areas would suggest. The initial breaking of bonds appears to give more reactivity on an energy usage basis than longer time activation. Most mechanical activation testwork so far has been carried out in batch mode. The result is diminishing effect of activation with increased grinding time. Continuous grinding and simultaneous reaction with some sort of classification may offer a chance of removing reaction products as soon as they are formed, giving a more energy effective process.",

The main features of this proposed gasifier are the adoption of a triple-beds structure (comprising pyrolyzer, gasifier, and combustor), the separation of a circulation path for tar-absorbing material and that for the fuel and silica sand. Independent circulation systems are employed for the fuel system and for the tar-absorbing particles, and the pyrolyzer and gasifier each have a two-stage fluidized bed: the lower stage is for the fuel system and the upper stage is for the tar-absorbing particle system. The two circulation systems each have an independent combustor. In the pyrolyzer, the tar formed together with the gas produced during the pyrolysis of the fuel in the lower stage is absorbed by tar-absorbing particles in the upper stage. By adopting this two-stage fluidized bed approach, mixing of the tar-absorbing particles, which is rather expensive, with the ash contained in the fuel can be avoided. Accordingly, accumulation of ash in the circulation path for tar-absorbing material can be avoided, and the quantity of the discharge of absorption particles can be reduced. Therefore, the quantity used can be greatly reduced. The quantity of costly tar-absorbing particles used can be further minimized by optimizing the quantity of particles with respect to the quantity of tar generated by the fuel.As the first stage towards development of the proposed new type gasifier, the fundamental experiments that simulated a two-stage pyrolyzer and gasifier were carried out. As a result, the amount of H2 formed by pyrolysis resulted in a marked increase by using porous alumina as the tar-absorbing particles than the conventional conditions of using only silica sand. The amount of H2 formed was more increased because the coke was not only cracked but also reformed by steam gasification.",

The photocatalytic activities of N-doped TiO2/ZrO2 were much greater than those of commercial Degussa P25 in both the UV and visible light regions.

     "abstract": "To suppress effectively fugitive dust emissions using water spraying systems at bulk solids handling an optimal design of these devices is necessary. The dust suppression mechanism for example at conveyor belt hand over points can be subdivided in a primary and a secondary dust minimization effect. In this case the moistening of the bulk solids is a primary dust minimization effect and the airborne dust capture is a secondary dust minimization effect. In this work the evaluation of both dust minimization effects is carried out. As a first step an experimental investigation of the total and the secondary dust suppression efficiency took place. A model of two separators which are acting in series got used to compare the measured efficiencies and to calculate the primary dust suppression efficiency. The secondary dust suppression effect showed low performance compared to the primary dust suppression efficiency. So it has to be clarified if the streaming situation and the dust concentration situation at the position where the nozzle operates can get improved. Therefore enquiries at different positions in the middle and aside a concentrated particle flow got carried out.The results provide an informative basis how water spraying systems can get improved to suppress fugitive dust emissions at bulk solids handling.",

This research examined a high shear wet granulation process and subsequent manufacturing of a tablet containing a biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) class II drug, gliclazide (low solubility, high permeability). Previous studies have concentrated on either granulation or tabletting but not both together; this work brings together the analysis as a single large multivariate process. The design of experiment (DoE) was performed according to an L9 Taguchi method with three replications, in total; thirty-six runs were performed. A full statistical analysis relating both granule and tablet properties to selected process parameters were carried out. The research illustrates that mapping a highly multivariate process is possible. Statistically significant critical process parameters were identified for granule hardness, granule density and granule particle size. These granule properties were also identified as contributing to the dissolution release characteristics. Dissolution modeling and prediction was achieved within the DoE structure. Process noise was identified and measured across the entire production and specifically with respect to the milling process.",

In particular, the slurries made of nano-sized particles and aggressive chemistries need to be characterized batch to batch and as a function of time to enable robust high volume manufacturing. In this study, the effect of slurry aging on CMP performance was investigated systematically for regular silica based slurry as well as for slurry containing an organic biocide additive to prevent bacteria formation. The parameters examined were particle size distribution, zeta potential, bacteria count, total organic carbon concentration, silicon ion dissolution, material removal rate (MRR), and surface quality. The results indicated that aging influenced slurry performance negatively and even with the addition of biocide, organic contamination was observed at the extended aging periods. The material removal rates decreased significantly by aging and more surface deformations were observed on the wafer surfaces polished with the slurries destabilized with the elapsed time. Slurries containing biocide were detected to be more prone to agglomeration and increase in particle size as the time passes after the slurry is exposed to the environment. Furthermore, the impact of short time slurry aging (conditioning) on particle properties of the slurries containing polymeric additives and the adverse affects of extreme stability in the slurries containing surfactants are also discussed in terms of the two other factors that can cause variability in CMP slurry performance.",

Following the strategy of incorporating a priori knowledge in a system, initial velocity information achieved by several experimental and numerical techniques is implemented in the numerical simulations. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) data are employed in a numeroexperimental hybrid and artificial neural network (ANN) data in numeroneuronal and neuroexperimental hybrids, where the ANNs are trained with numerical or PIV data, respectively.

     "abstract": "Determining the size of nanoparticles accurately, quickly and easily is becoming more and more important as the use of such particles increases. One of the common techniques for measuring the size of particles in suspension is dynamic light scattering (DLS). In principle, DLS is able to estimate the hydrodynamic particle diameter and its intensity-weighted distribution. However, the measured correlation function or power spectrum must be inverted to obtain this size distribution. The inversion is an ill-posed mathematical problem, and only under certain assumptions can the distribution be determined reliably. Suspensions containing bimodal (or multi-modal) particle size distributions are particularly challenging. This study reports on DLS measurements on a range of bimodal distributions of latex spheres with varying ratios of particle sizes. To determine the efficacy of different inversion techniques, the data has been analyzed both with the algorithms implemented in the DLS instrument\u2019s proprietary analysis software and with other inversion routines based on simple analytical models of the particle size distribution.

This is because dead spaces are generated in the centrifugal separator at the low flow rate.

The exploration of unique sizes and shapes as they relate to various properties has become a great quest for large field applications. To meet these demands, this review covers recent developments in particle processing. An aerosol-assisted self-assembly technique, with a spray-drying method as a representative of it, to create particles is thoroughly reviewed. Its popularity and its broad use in industry for producing particles are the main reason of this review; thus, elucidation of this method is important for the improvement of particle technology. A practical spray-drying method is described from the step-by-step process to the selection of apparatus types (merits and demerits). Elaboration of particle processing of several morphologies (sphere, doughnut, encapsulated, porous, hollow, and hairy) is discussed in terms of the selection of material types, the addition of supporting materials, and the change of process conditions. Controllable size is also discussed in terms of the adjustment of the droplet size, initial precursor concentration, and the addition of specific techniques. A comparison between a theoretical mechanism and current experimental results (over a 15-year period) are shown to clarify how particles with various sizes and morphologies are designed. This method must be considered an art rather than a science because of its advantages in creating wonderful and unique particle shapes. The performance of various particle morphologies is also demonstrated, which is essential for an understanding of the importance that shape can exert on practical use. Because the method outlined here can be broadly applied to the production of various types of functional materials, we believe that this report contributes new information to the field of chemical, material, environmental, and medical engineering.",

When the binder concentration in the surface region of a slurry droplet increased during drying, a crust of granule was formed because particle migration was hindered by high fluid viscosity. For the rigid crust layer, granules were hollow. When the crust layer was formed early in drying and its thickness was thin, granule surface partially collapsed inward, whereas the granule resulted in depression granules.",

A minimum fluidization velocity, an apparent specific gravity of fluidized bed and floating-sinking behaviors of dry and wet coals were measured in the range of relative humidity from 50% to 80%. In a hydrophilic particle, the fluidization became unstable with increasing relative humidity because particle aggregation took place at a high humidity, and hence floating-sinking behaviors depend on changes in a relative humidity. On the other hand, in a highly hydrophobic particle, the fluidization was stable and floating-sinking behaviors based on the specific gravity difference were obtained even for wet coals and at a high relative humidity. Therefore, the FBMS using a highly hydrophobic particle is applicable at a high relative humidity without a control device of relative humidity.",

The effect of the equivalence ratio on process parameters like maximum temperature of the flame, specific surface area of particles and flame structure was investigated.

In this study a baffle device is introduced to the inlet system in order to achieve a more uniform gas velocity distribution. A more uniform gas inlet distribution can be obtained by adjustment of the lengths and angles of the baffles. The gas velocities along the inlet and filtration surfaces are measured using a pitot tube.

The impact energy of grinding balls was numerically analyzed, and the influence of drum dimensions and drum rotational speed on the impact energy was investigated. It was found that scale-up of the rotating drum should be carried out based on the mechanical energy instantaneously applied to the powder and its cumulative amount. The former was evaluated in terms of the frequency distribution of the impact energy and the latter its cumulative amount over the elapsed milling time, which could be controlled by the drum rotational speed and the milling time, respectively.

Experiments were carried out to characterize the axial segregation in bi-dispersed suspension at various filling fraction and rotation speed of cylinder. The mixture of same particles in absence of any suspending fluid did not show any segregation. However, in case of particles suspended in water it was observed that the rate of segregation increases with increase in filling fraction. Once the particles get segregated along the full length of the cylinder, these bands start to migrate along the tube axis finally merging to give wider bands. For a given filling fraction the rate of segregation increases with the angular speed of the rotating cylinder. When the tube is partially filled the particle segregation is observed at higher angular speed, whereas in fully filled case the segregation starts at much lower rotation speed for the same concentration of particles. The segregation pattern changes as the rotation speed is increased. At higher speed the centrifugal force dominates over gravitational and viscous drag forces and this result into completely different segregation patterns.

The prepared suspension is stable for a few days; therefore, it was not necessary to place an additional mixing during the deposition process. The particle aggregation/disaggregation formation was observed on the metal surface in order to study the effect of pulse direct current (DC) charging in comparison with conventional DC charging. At the charging frequency of 80\u00a0Hz, it was observed that pulse DC charging with a maximum applied voltage of 3.3\u00a0V/cm (50% duty cycle) clearly reduced the degree of aggregation of particles having diameters of 50 and 300\u00a0nm comparing to those of DC charging. Pulse charging at high frequency is thus found to be more effective in preventing particle aggregation during electrophoretic deposition than conventional DC charging.",

A nanocrystalline TiO2 layer was fabricated on the FTO-glass substrate of the working electrode, and then sintered in a high-temperature furnace. The working electrode with a TiO2 thin film was immersed in the solution of N-719 (Ruthenium) dye for 12\u00a0h. Moreover, the counter electrode with a layer of Ag (or without a layer of Ag) and a layer of SWCNT, which were (or was) fabricated in that order on the FTO-glass substrate, was subsequently prepared. Finally, the DSSC was assembled, the power conversion efficiency of the DSSC was measured using an I\u2013V measurement system, and the incident photo conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the DSSC was obtained using the phase-locked loop optical chopper. This study also examined the effects of a layer of Ag deposited on the FTO-glass substrate, the type of organic solvent (such as DMAC and acetylacetone), and the sintering temperature on the performance of the DSSC. This film of SWCNT/Ag markedly increased the IPCE from 3.9% (conventional DSSC with a thin film of platinum on the FTO-glass substrate of the counter electrode) to 15.3% (DSSC with SWCNT/Ag/acetylacetone), as the wavelength of the light was 380\u00a0nm. Furthermore, as the wavelength of the light is 550\u00a0nm, the IPCE of the DSSC with SWCNT/Ag/acetylacetone (6.8%) becomes nearly equal to that of conventional DSSC (7.2%). Most interestingly, this study shows that the power conversion efficiency of the DSSC with SWCNT/Ag/acetylacetone (1.3037%) is not inferior to that of DSSC with a thin film of platinum on the counter electrode (1.25%).",

It was observed that there exists a critical velocity at 0.017\u00a0cm/s for the release of kaolin, and plugging of these released particles was significant in the bed.

It was found that gangue with density less than 2850\u00a0kg/m3 which float is able to be separated from valuable ore with density greater than 2850\u00a0km/m3 which sink. The set point (density where half the particles float and half the particles sink) decreases with increasing the air velocity, and that the float-sink separation is completed within 2\u00a0min.

As Dave decreases below 17.6\u00a0mm, the ore particles with density near the set point tend to scatter in the fluidized bed without floating or sinking, resulting in separation efficiency which decreases with decreasing Dave. This indicates that the size of the ore particles is one of the major factors to achieve high separation efficiency.",

The amount of charge on the polymer influences the adsorption conformation of the polymer which influences the dominant mechanism for inter-particle attraction. Low charge density results in primarily bridging flocculation while high charge density results in primarily charge patch attraction. Although the bridging adhesion is generally lower in magnitude than for the charge patch, the bridging flocculation typically produces large aggregates while the charge patch mechanism results in smaller aggregates due to the influence of shear during aggregation. The optimum dose for aggregation (supernatant clarity) of each type of polymer corresponds well with the polymer concentration which produces the maximum adhesive force measured with AFM. The influence of aggregate size on the compressive and shear yield stresses is weak, but the compressive and shear yield stresses increase linearly with increasing adhesion force.",

As the flocculant dose was increased the charge of the floc was observed to reverse; the actual dose at which charge reversal occurs being dependent on the flocculant charge density and molecular weight.

     "abstract": "Unimin\u2019s kaolin clay slurry displayed a maximum yield stress that is not located at the point of zero charge or at low zeta potential. Adsorbed phosphate additives at sufficient concentration caused this yield stress to reduce to zero. The clear implication of these two results is that the particle interactions contributing to the maximum yield stress must be due to unlike charged or positive\u2013negative charge attraction. The adsorbed negatively charged phosphate additives neutralised the positively charge sites of the clay particles causing the suspension to be completely dispersed and the yield stress to disappear. The monophosphate additive is less effective in dispersing the slurries. Based on charge concentration of additives, the pyrophosphate, triphosphate and polyphosphate appeared to be equally as effective in dispersing the clay slurries. The yield stress-DLVO force model that predicts a linear relationship between yield stress and square of zeta potential with a negative slope, is obeyed by the kaolin slurries with adsorbed phosphate additives. However, with the slurry without phosphate additive it displayed three linear relationships with negative and positive slopes. The negative slope relationships were located in the low and high zeta potential regions while the positive slope relationship was found in between these regions.",

While fine particles had very poor recovery in the Denver cell, greater than 70% recoveries were achieved in the electroflotation cell.

The formation mechanism was proposed: zirconia gel was formed after the reaction of ZrOCl2 with urotropine. The superstoichiometric urotropine was dissolved and distributed uniformly in the gel. The small pores were generated because gaseous hydrolysates of urotropine were constrained in the gel during the hydrothermal treatment. During the process of the amorphous gel transferred into the crystals, some of the pores coarsened with the crystals growth. Big pores disappeared due to the break of the crystals. And only the small pores were remained in the interior of crystals, which could hardly be eliminated by the subsequent crystal growth if the calcination temperature is below 550\u00a0\u00b0C.

Pressure induced devitrification in the amorphous and ternary system was also studied using PXRD. Elastic energy/plastic energy (EE/PE) ratio of AmCEL, CryCEL and Ter-Mix was found to be 1.71, 2.32, and 1.91, respectively at 6.35\u00a0MPa. Similar trend was observed at all studied compaction pressures. AmCEL showed significant devitrification, while Ter-Mix showed degree of crystallinity (DOC) of 11.9%, when compacted at tableting pressures of 109\u00a0MPa. Parameters \u2018a\u2019, \u20181/b\u2019, and \u2018Py\u2019 obtained using Kawakita equation and Heckel equation gave values of 0.86, 5.2, and 253.4\u00a0MPa for CryCEL, 0.89, 4.85, and 103\u00a0MPa for AmCEL and 0.68, 16.1, and 169.6\u00a0MPa for Ter-Mix, respectively. The study revealed significant differences in compaction properties of CryCEL, AmCEL, and Ter-Mix. AmCEL was not suitable for compacted solid dosage forms due to pressure induced devitrification. However, stabilized AmCEL in Ter-Mix showed relatively lesser devitrification and can be developed as compacted dosage forms.",

The Fe3O4\u2013chitosan nanoparticles were obtained by crosslinking the amino groups on the chitosan using glutaraldehyde. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the Fe3O4\u2013chitosan nanoparticles were quasi-spherical with a mean diameter of 10.5\u00a0nm. X-ray diffraction pattern and X-ray photoelectron spectra indicated that the magnetic nanoparticles were pure Fe3O4 with a cubic inverse spinel structure. The modification using chitosan did not result in a phase change. The binding of chitosan to the Fe3O4 nanoparticles was also demonstrated by the measurement of fourier transform infrared spectra and thermogravimetric analysis. Magnetic measurement revealed that the saturation magnetization of the composite nanoparticles was 30.7\u00a0emu/g and the nanoparticles were superparamagnetic at room temperature. Furthermore, the inductive heating property of the composite nanoparticles in an alternating current magnetic field was investigated and the results indicated that the heating effect was significant.

     "abstract": "Ferroboron is an iron-boron alloy containing 10\u201320% of boron by weight. Commercial ferroboron production is made by two main processes: carbothermic reaction and aluminothermic reaction. Ferroboron also occurs in steel surfaces due to boronizing, which is applied to increase surface hardness in steel. Boronizing is a thermo-chemical surface hardening treatment. The ferroboron phases like Fe2B, FeB form by diffusing of boron element into iron. These phases are very hard, wear strengths are high, and friction coefficients are low.In this study, ferroboron powder was obtained by boronizing ASC 100.29 iron powder that was used widely in powder metallurgy area. Solid boronizing method was preferred due to its advantages in applications and Ekabor-HM powder was used as the boronizing agent. The 80% ASC 100.29 and 20% Ekabor HM were mixed homogeneously and subjected to boronizing at 850\u2013950\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u20136\u00a0h. Formation and development of ferroboron phase on the samples was determined by metallographic studies depending on various treatment conditions. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the Fe2B phase did form but FeB phase did not. Micro hardness distributions were measured on the powder grains. Eighteen GPa hardness was measured at Fe2B phase obtained by boronizing while hardness of non-boronized iron powders was 1.06\u00a0GPa. The thickness of ferroboron layer formed by boronizing changed with boronizing conditions. The thickness of ferroboron layer increased with boronizing temperature or boronizing time. Depending upon processing parameters, ferroboron layers was formed partially or throughout ferrous powder structure. Since boronizing can be applied to iron powders having any size or shape, ferroboron production with required shape and size is possible.Finally, a new method, namely solid boronizing method, was developed in ferroboron powder production.",

Although the collection efficiency of ESP is over 99%, the performance of ESP is affected by dust properties, especially the electric resistivity of the dust. In Japan, many different kinds of coal are used in pulverized coal combustion boilers. The property of coal ash formed in pulverized coal combustion is different for different coals. It is very important to develop high performance ESPs for different kinds of coal ash. In general, the low temperature ESP operated at about 423\u00a0K has been used for a long time, but the electric resistivity of some kinds of coal ash is higher than suitable for the ESP in this temperature range. A high temperature ESP operated at 623\u00a0K was developed about 20\u00a0years ago and an advanced low temperature ESP operated at 373\u00a0K has been used recently for control of the electric resistivity of coal ash.In this paper, we report on the influence of operating temperature from 363\u00a0K to 623\u00a0K on performance of ESP for a pulverized coal combustion boiler. The influence of coal ash properties including electric resistivity, alkali metal concentration, and operating condition on collection efficiency of an ESP is estimated.",

In order to obtain a variety of the values of exponent, we propose a simple two-fluid cubic lattice model. We first created a complex interfacial geometry between gas and liquid in a granular packed bed using a percolation model, and then calculated the removal rate of solute with matrix diffusion by performing the random walk of solute particles in the invaded liquid phase until the random walkers of solute reach to the gas/liquid interface. A significant power law was observed in the dissipation rate of solute particles with the proposed model. As the saturation of the invading gas in the matrix increases, the absolute value of exponent increased from 0.5, up to approximately 1.0, which cannot be reproduced by the previous analytical models.

It was found that the temperature gradient near the channel wall, in mixed flow regime, is higher than the temperature gradient in forced convection regime. Increasing the temperature gradient increased the effect of thermophoresis on deposition of particles. It was observed that the deposition was increased with the Richardson number. The distance between cylinders is a parameter that influences the deposition of particles. Temperature gradient decreases with increasing the cylinders\u2019 distance; on the other hand, the length of the high temperature gradient zone, which is located in the region between the cylinders where the most deposition occurs, will be increased. These two opposite phenomena cause the fact that at a distance which is four times longer than the cylinders\u2019 length, a maximum cumulative deposition fraction occurs. It was eventually concluded that the thermophoresis and the inertial impaction are dominant deposition mechanisms of particles on the channel wall.",

Several operating parameters as independent variables, namely activation time, temperature and roasting time, and synthetic rutile content as dependent variable, were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD). A second-degree equation for independent and dependent variables was computed and used to create the response surface and contours. It showed that linear effect of activation time, temperature and roasting time, interaction effect between activation time and temperature, square effect of activation time showed influence on synthetic rutile content. According to results from analysis of variance (ANOVA), the value of the determination coefficient (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9767) indicates that the model was a good fit that 97.67% of the variation could be explained well by the model. The value of the adjusted determination coefficient (adj.R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9558) was also very high to advocate for a high significance of the model. The predicted synthetic rutile content after process optimization was found to agree satisfactory with the experimental values. The optimum experiment parameters were found as follows: activation time of 170.42\u00a0min, temperature of 1149.28\u00a0\u00b0C, and roasting time of 20.79\u00a0min.

A theoretical discussion involving the space charge effect with the basis of \u2018charge relaxation model,\u2019 in which the maximum charge is limited to cause gas break down, is shown. The result showed two regions in which the space charge does not affect on, and dominates the amount of the charge.

The pressure drop in the bed displayed an almost constant value that had a plateau, with increasing gas velocity. The moisture content of the organic powder decreased with an increase in the gas velocity or rotational speed of the bed, however, its variation trend did not change considerably with a variation of feed loading or an initial moisture content within this experimental conditions.

     "abstract": "The force propagation speed in granular matter is a very difficult property to be measured. A new technique has been developed to calculate the force propagation speed in granular matter based on measuring experimentally the contact time. The contact time for a particle hitting a bed of particles is estimated as the time taken for a particle to strike a bed of particles till the time of its ejection, and it is calculated using the discrete element method. The speed of force propagation in a bed of particles is estimated by plotting the dependence of the path length of the contact force on the contact time and finding the gradient of such dependence. Such approach leads to accurate results if the impact speed is below the yield velocity, i.e. no plastic deformations. It is found that the force propagation speed in spherical granular matter is proportional to the impact speed of the incident particle, which is different from force propagation in continuum matter. It is also found that the propagation speed is dependent on the material and diameters ratio of the interacting particles, but it is not dependent on the number of bed layers. The propagation speed in granular matter is normalized by dividing it by a reference propagation speed, i.e. the propagation speed at an impact speed of 1\u00a0m/s. It is found that the normalized propagation speed is independent of the material and diameter of the interacting particles, but it is logarithmically proportional to the impact speed. The proportionality constant is equal to 0.16, which can be taken as a universal constant for force propagation in spherical granular matter.",

After obtaining the flow field, the initial collector efficiency \u03b70 is calculated from trajectory analysis and compared with experimental data. The reasonably good agreement between the theory and experiments suggests that the current model is physically plausible and potentially useful for granular filter performance prediction if further theoretical development is implemented.",

The carbon coated LiMnPO4 was used as cathode active materials for lithium-ion batteries, and electrochemical performance was investigated using the Li|1\u00a0M LiClO4 in EC:DEC\u00a0=\u00a01:1|LiMnPO4 cells at room temperature and 55\u00a0\u00b0C.

Experimental results showed that the mass of abraded balls increased in proportion to the grinding time in the early stage of grinding up to 75\u00a0min. The abrasion rate increases quadratically with the mill rotation speed. It decreases with an increase in ball diameter up to 12.7\u00a0mm and then slightly increases when the diameter is 15.8\u00a0mm. It also increases with an increase in the ball-filling ratio of the mill up to 50%. Similar tendencies are found in the impact energy calculated from the balls motion simulated by DEM. Therefore, it is said that the abrasion rate has a strong correlation to the impact energy of balls under any milling conditions.",

The role of particle shape in particular is highlighted, both in the context of its effect on paste rheology and on water demand. The spherical particles of fly ash and the platy particles of metakaolin show opposite effects in each of these areas, and this must be understood and controlled if an effective geopolymer concrete is to be designed. The angular particles of blast furnace slag are also important in determining paste rheology and porosity. The selection of the correct combination of aggregate gradings is critical in maximising concrete durability, as the ability of aggregates to pack sufficiently densely in a hardened concrete product then hinders the ability of aggressive external agents to migrate into the concrete and cause structural damage to either the binder or the embedded steel reinforcing.",

In this study, hollow silica microparticles were prepared using a rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli (KP7600), as a biological template. Silica nanoparticles were generated in addition to coated biological templates when the reaction rate was increased, so control of reaction rate is important for coating silica smoothly onto the bacterial surface. Silica coating was also carried out using the fixed cells (with and without internal water) using glutaraldehyde as templates. When the fixed cells without internal water were used as templates, no rod-shaped particles were observed after calcination of the synthesized particles. By contrast, silica hollow particles were formed using the fixed cells with internal water as templates. This means that the internal water inside biological cells acts as an initiator for hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and results in the formation of smooth silica shell surface and indicates that the use of dry cultured bacteria templates is not required. Thus, there is a significant benefit in using gram-negative bacteria as templates for producing hollow silica microparticles, compared with the method using dried gram-positive bacteria templates.",

Although the stable immobilization was macroscopically observed even at ca. 70% of the volume fraction of TBP in the glass sample, the results of the thermogravimetry\u2013differential thermal analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and immersion tests in water suggested that TBP is not chemically bound to the silica matrix but topologically entrapped in the cage of siloxane bonds. The relatively high Vickers hardness indicated that the network of siloxane bonds envelopes the immobilized TBP molecules. The results of wide angle X-ray scattering showed that the unit length of the siloxane bond does not significantly depend on the volume fraction of TBP. The expansion in the volume due to the incorporation of TBP occurred not uniformly but quite locally at the spots at which TBP molecules were embedded. The formation of the network of siloxane bonds is enhanced in the vicinity of the enveloped TBP molecules because of its Lewis basicity at the phosphate group.",

The NIPA-VBTA and the NIPA-DMAEMA copolymer gels adsorbed BSA while the NIPA homopolymer gel hardly adsorbed BSA, indicating that the copolymer gels adsorb BSA through the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged groups in the gels and the negatively charged BSA. The adsorption amounts for the NIPA-DMAEMA gels were smaller than those for the NIPA-VBTA gels. This may be because almost every VBTA group, which is a quaternary ammonium salt, can be positively charged in water, while only some of the tertiary amine DMAEMA groups are protonated in water. Moreover, it was found that both the copolymer gels with a large mesh size of the polymer network repeatedly adsorbed BSA at 298\u00a0K and desorbed some of pre-adsorbed BSA at 313\u00a0K by the temperature-swing operation. This BSA desorption may result from the decrease of the number of the positively charged groups accessible to BSA due to the shrinking of the constituent polymer chains.",

     "abstract": "A method for dispersing dry particles in a liquid is described. The method involves coating large carrier particles with fine particles. When two types of particles having different sizes are mixed in dry conditions, the particles adhere to one another, and the large particles become coated with small particles. When the large core particles are coated with a mono-layer of small particles, further agglomeration is inhibited. Because the single small particles generated by the disruption adhere to the core particles, we presumed that, if the small particles that are adhered to large particles could be separated from the large particles by a sonication in a liquid, the dry fine particles could be dispersed in a liquid.The dispersion experiments conducted using spherical silica particles having a count median diameter Dp50 of 74\u00a0nm as small particles and spherical glass beads as large particles. In this situation, the large particles carry the small particles from a dry condition into a liquid. We refer to the large particles as carrier particles. The experiments revealed that the proposed dispersion procedure results in a superior product, compared to sonication only. The effect of carrier size on dispersion performance is also investigated. The findings indicate and an optimum carrier size exists. Observations of the carrier particle surfaces after dry mixing indicate that the optimum condition is the condition at which a mono-layer of Silica particles is formed.",

     "abstract": "Crystalline ZnO quantum dots have been synthesized by hydrolysis of zinc acetate dihydrate with lithium hydroxide in ethanolic solution. By varying different parameters of the synthesis process, the size of the ZnO particles can be controlled. Detailed investigation of the ripening of the nanoparticles evidenced that despite of the well-known influence of ageing temperature and time, the presence of the reaction byproduct lithium acetate strongly affects the ripening behaviour. In particular, the particle size can be almost completely arrested by the removal of this byproduct via reversible flocculation of the ZnO nanoparticles using heptane as an antisolvent. A closer analysis of the repeated washing process shows an initial improvement of the colloidal stability of the ZnO nanoparticles during the first purification cycle as it mainly removes the lithium acetate from the suspension and not the stabilizing acetate groups directly bound to the particle surface. With further washing the remaining acetate ligands are unable to maintain the stabilization against agglomeration of the ZnO nanoparticles. Thus, there exists an optimum between purification progress and colloidal stability. These findings are also confirmed by calculations according to the DLVO theory, which show that there exists nearly no primary minimum of small ZnO nanoparticles below 5\u00a0nm in the presence of stabilizing acetate ions whereas the decrease in acetate ions bound to the particle surface leads to a more and more pronounced primary minimum. The present work is of particular significance for the preparation of purified colloidal ZnO nanoparticles for studies of their electrical and optical properties with respect to their wide range of potential applications.",

The grinding kinetics, the particle size of the final product and the amount of PVP grafted onto the silica particles depend on grinding conditions like VP and quartz concentration, pH and size of grinding media. The grinding kinetics becomes slower in the presence of VP due to the damping effect of the forming PVP chains. The final particle size, however, is almost independent on VP concentration. The amount of PVP grafted onto the silica particles ground for 12\u00a0h increases with growing VP concentration because the amount of adsorbed VP and the polymerization rate increase with growing VP concentration.The primary particle size and the kinetics of particle breakage do not depend on the pH-value of the dispersing medium, whereas the degree of agglomeration of the particles decreases with increasing pH-value of the medium. Under alkaline conditions, however, less PVP is grafted onto the quartz particles than under neutral or strong acidic conditions. The reasons for these effects are pH-dependent interactions between the grafted PVP chains and the surface hydroxyl groups on the quartz particles. If the quartz concentration in the suspension decreases the grinding kinetics becomes much faster because the specific energy input increases with decreasing particle concentration if the other process parameters are kept constant. For a very low quartz concentration (1\u00a0wt.%), however, after 7\u00a0h of grinding the particle size measured by dynamic light scattering starts to increase with grinding time. SEM investigations reveal that grinding of 1\u00a0wt.% quartz in aqueous VP solution for longer than 7\u00a0h results in the formation of plate-like particles.",

The results obtained are as follows: when the friction is so strong that the adsorbed particles are stuck to the substrate, ordered structures never form, which seems to be quite natural. However, when the magnitude of the frictional force is moderate, an ordered structure can form even with low coverage because the frictional force aids order formation. This is because the friction counterbalances the particles\u2019 Brownian motion, which would otherwise disturb the ordered structure. Furthermore, through a detailed examination of the distribution of the Brownian motion, it is demonstrated that an increase in the friction has a similar effect as a decrease in temperature.",
