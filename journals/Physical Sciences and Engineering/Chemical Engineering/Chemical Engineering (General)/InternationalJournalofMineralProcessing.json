     "abstract": "In this study adsorption of rhenium ions from single and bi-component solutions (Re-Mo) by Purolite A170 was studied experimentally and described by isotherm, kinetic and thermodynamic modeling. Considering coefficient of determination (R2) and values of root mean squared error (RMSE) for the multicomponent isotherms, the extended model of Freundlich isotherm was found to be successful. Moreover, fitting the time-dependent data into different mechanisms showed that the data comply well with the pseudo-second order model. Results from the binary systems demonstrated that the presence of the secondary metal ions in the system causes a decrease in the adsorption capacity of rhenium, which is mainly due to the competitive effects of metals for adsorption sites. Furthermore, evaluation of thermodynamic parameters showed that the reaction mechanisms are different for both systems; however, due to negative values of \u0394H, in competitive condition the adsorption of rhenium becomes more feasible with increasing the temperature.",

     "abstract": "Biological reduction of soluble selenate to insoluble elemental selenium enables the removal and recovery of selenium from aqueous streams. Economic, efficient biological selenium recovery depends on properties of selenium particles such as size, density, stability, hydrophilic character and attachment to the biomass. In batch and fed-batch reactors using anaerobic sludge, the influence of pH (6-9) and temperature (20\u201350\u00a0\u00b0C) on the morphology, structure and stability of the biologically produced selenium particles were studied using SEM, XRD, and light microscopy. At a high pH or a high temperature these experiments resulted in grey crystalline hexagonal acicular selenium particles, while at a low pH combined with a low temperature red amorphous nanospheres were dominant. Particle stability tests were carried out by changing the temperature or pH after the particles had formed. Red amorphous selenium spheres (produced at pH\u00a0=\u00a07 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C) transformed gradually towards the grey hexagonal structure at 50\u00a0\u00b0C over a period of three weeks, whereas the transformation was less or not detected under other process conditions (according XRD). We show here that biological selenium particle crystallinity, shape and color can be controlled by temperature and pH. However, the choice for the temperature and pH in the bioreactor should not limit the biomass' reduction capacity of selenate. The production of crystalline particles is an important first step to grow larger selenium particles in the future in order to reduce costs for selenium recovery in bioreactors.",

     "abstract": "The particle settling is a basic phenomenon: however, it determines the design of many unit operations and machines of mineral processing. A new test device has been developed in order to measure the terminal settling velocity of large steel balls settling in fine particulate solids - water mixtures. The developed inductive sensor does not influence the motion of the ball and it can be applied for non-transparent and non-Newtonian fine suspensions. A new hypothesis, namely a continuity theory for coarse disperse systems is introduced here. According to this theory, if the particles of a fine suspension are so small that they fit into the laminar sub-layer around a settling coarse particle, the fine suspension can be treated as a continuum. If they do not fit, hindered settling dominates between the coarse and fine particles. It was also recognised that if a particle settles at a constant speed in any media that is in an equilibrium state, therefore, the \u201cequilibrium mean surficial shear stress (\u03c4e)\u201d and the \u201cequilibrium mean surficial shear rate\u201d have been introduced. The equilibrium mean surficial shear stress can be calculated initially, because it is simply the force of gravity minus the buoyant force over three times the total surface of the particle. Once \u03c4e is known, the equivalent Newtonian absolute viscosity can be determined and the terminal settling velocity of particles falling in non-Newtonian media can be calculated by the known procedures for Newtonian fluids.",

Then in the second stage, NH4OH is added for increasing the solution pH and removing the impurities from solutions.

Carbonation efficiency attains a maximum value at 75\u00a0\u00b0C and then decreases gradually with increasing temperature up to 300\u00a0\u00b0C, with both CO2 and NH4HCO3.

     "abstract": "Quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN) and diagnostic leaching (DL) are the two main methods to evaluate the gold refractoriness nature. Limited availability of QEMSCAN or its cost sometimes can be the drive to use DL method, or vice versa.We present the results of a comparative study that investigates and compares the origin of the refractoriness of two different gold samples with QEMSCAN and DL. As a baseline, the gold recovery values of samples 1 and 2 via the standard cyanidation process over a leaching period of 24\u00a0h were 74% and 54%, respectively. Based on the DL tests, the refractoriness of samples 1 and 2 was mostly related to the fine dissemination and association of the electrum (Au-Ag alloy) and gold telluride with the sulfide minerals, particularly pyrite. The QEMSCAN analysis provided more details about the gold deportment in the two samples. The QEMSCAN results showed that the gold in the two samples was mostly present as electrum and gold-telluride. In sample 1, about 89% of the gold occurred in the form of electrum with a 63% Au and 36% Ag composition. The main gold form in sample 2 was gold-telluride (81%). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results demonstrated that the gold telluride phase was in the form of calaverite (AuTe2) in both samples. The QEMSCAN results suggested that 77% of gold in sample 1 and 88% of gold in sample 2 were liberated or locked in the sulfide minerals, and the balance was the solid solution gold. Based on the QEMSCAN study, the total liberated gold and the gold locked in the sulfide minerals are expected to be amenable to cyanide leaching after a complete sulfide oxidation process, i.e. pretreatment. DL tests, however, suggested that 91% of the gold in sample 1 and 87% of the gold in sample 2 were leachable after the oxidation of sulfides in the two samples.Lastly, the two samples were pretreated by (1) roasting, and (2) atmospheric oxidation to oxidize sulfide minerals and render the samples more amenable to cyanide leaching. The gold recoveries of the roasting calcines by cyanidation were 93% and 76% for samples 1 and 2, respectively. The cyanidation of the atmospheric oxidation residues provided a greater gold recovery for both sample 1 (96%) and sample 2 (85%). Gold recovery for sample 1 was underestimated by QEMSCAN, however the gold recovery values were estimated well by DL.",

     "publication date": "12-2017",
     "abstract": "In this study, the effect of sodium chloride on the flotation of a fine coal sample was investigated. The results indicated that flotation of coal was highly dependent on changes in sodium chloride concentration. An increase in the sodium chloride concentration resulted in increases in the combustible recovery as well as concentrate ash content. The froth stability and particle size distribution in the slurries with different sodium chloride concentrations were measured. The results showed that the increase in froth stability and enlargement in particle size were both favorable for the recovery of coal particles in flotation. The underlying mechanism was investigated by examining the zeta potential of pure coal particles and pulp rheology. The pulp rheology measurements clearly indicated that changes in froth stability were attributed to changes in slurry viscosity, which ultimately enhanced the recovery of coal particles. The decrease in zeta potential was responsible for the increase in particle size in slurries due to particle coagulation, which is caused by a decrease in electrostatic repulsion among the particles.",

     "abstract": "This paper introduced dextran sulfate sodium, a medical intermediate rich in sulfate group, as a potential depressant for calcite and fluorite in scheelite flotation. The flotation behaviors of scheelite, calcite and fluorite under different pulp pH with dextran sulfate sodium acting as depressant and sodium oleate acting as collector were studied through micro-flotation tests. The results showed that when sodium oleate was used alone, the three minerals floated well and were difficult to separate. Dextran sulfate sodium exhibited a selective depressant effect on calcite and fluorite flotation when it was added before sodium oleate. Using dextran sulfate sodium as depressant could achieve the preferential flotation separation of scheelite from calcite and fluorite by control of pulp pH at 7.0. The selective depressant effect of dextran sulfate sodium on calcite and fluorite was explored through surface analyses including zeta potential measurements, contact angle measurements and FTIR studies on mineral samples treated with dextran sulfate sodium and/or sodium oleate. On the basis of the surface analyses, a selective adsorption model of dextran sulfate sodium on calcite and fluorite was proposed.",

     "abstract": "Flotation, which exploits the differences in the surface wettability of minerals to effect separation, has been crucial in rare earth elements (REE) beneficiation. Monazite, a phosphate mineral commonly containing REE (typically lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium), occurs in association with hematite and quartz gangue minerals in some low grade deposits. In this study, the physicochemical properties including contact angle, zeta potential, and floatability of monazite, hematite, and quartz were determined in the presence of oleic acid as a collector. Contact angle measurements indicated adsorption of oleic acid onto the minerals' surfaces. Zeta potential measurements were used to elucidate oleic acid adsorption mechanism onto the mineral particle surfaces. Results from zeta potential measurements indicated that depressants are required to achieve selective flotation recovery of monazite from hematite and quartz. The flotation test results confirmed poor selectivity between monazite; and hematite and quartz, respectively. However, rare earth oxides (REO) in monazite floated better than both hematite and quartz at all the oleic acid dosages investigated. The use of sodium silicate and starch as depressants enhanced the selective flotation recovery of REO from hematite and quartz mixtures.",

     "abstract": "Copper is commonly produced by hydrometallurgical processes. The production of this metal results in the formation of emissions (unwanted solids, liquids and gases). In this paper, an effluent from a Cu producer company is valorized by means of Fe and Cu recovery.In the current process, an effluent from the secondary solvent extraction (secondary raffinate) was sent to neutralization plant to be discharged. In this paper a modification of the process is proposed. The secondary raffinate was contacted with TP207 resin for Fe3\u00a0+ and Cu recovery. Metals were eluted from the resins using another real effluent (primary raffinate, effluent from the primary solvent extraction) from the same plant.Experiments for the uptake and elution were carried out in batch and in columns. The effect of pH, resin dosing, and temperature onto metals retention are analyzed. Retention efficiencies (loading capacities) were 50.1% (8.1\u00a0mg\u00b7g\u2212\u00a01) for Cu and 54.8% (23.2\u00a0mg\u00b7g\u2212\u00a01) for Fe3\u00a0+ under the optimal operational conditions (pH\u00a0=\u00a00.45 and T\u00a0=\u00a065\u00a0\u00b0C). These values were confirmed in column tests. It is possible to recover Fe3\u00a0+ and Cu from the secondary raffinate, leaving most of Fe2\u00a0+ and other elements in solution. The experimental affinities that TP207 showed are: Cu\u00a0>\u00a0Fe3\u00a0+\u00a0>\u00a0Fe2\u00a0+\u00a0>\u00a0Zn.The elution of Fe and Cu was quantitatively achieved with concentrated H2SO4 solution. When acidified primary raffinate was used as eluting solution, an enriched solution containing 14.3\u00a0g Cu\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01, 20.3\u00a0g Fe2\u00a0+\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01, and 18.6 de g Fe3\u00a0+\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01 was obtained. This enriched primary raffinate can be reintroduced in the process as leaching solution.So, after the modification of the process, using secondary raffinate as loading solution and acidified primary raffinate as eluting solution, the ion-exchange stage could substitute the external FeSO4 addition. In addition, 30\u201380\u00a0kg\u00a0Cu\u00b7h\u2212\u00a01 are reintroduced in the process.",

     "abstract": "The underground separation of gangue from coal is an important part of the process of reducing transportation costs and improving production efficiency. A new method is proposed in this paper to separate gangue from coal on the basis of density, calculated from volume using three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning technology. This approach is based on the laser triangulation method and weight. Taking into account the weigh-in-motion technology that is currently widely applied, the main objective of this approach is to determine the volume of the object being measured. Thus, the principles of 3D laser scanning and laser triangulation were studied in detail and a relative formula was deduced. The reasons and solutions for possible errors are also analyzed in this paper, depending on the method applied to measure volumes of gangue and coal. Physical relationships of objects to be measured, as well as laser and measuring data planes are also presented, depending on principles of 3D laser scanning. A parameter selection method is presented to determine the appropriate photoelectric recognition device to use for coal or gangue, while error due to voids between objects was measured, and transportation belts analyzed. The assumption put forward in this study is that the ratios of voids between objects, transportation belt, and the exact volume of objects all conform to a normal distribution; this was shown to be the case by both experiments and statistical theory. A mathematical model was therefore constructed that is suitable for the recognition of coal and gangue based on this theory, while algorithms of recognition threshold values and identification rate are presented.",

     "abstract": "Collophane is an important phosphate mineral, which has proven to be difficult to float from gangue. In this work, the novel application of reactive oily bubbles to enhance collophane flotation is reported. Three different types of bubbles, conventional air bubble, oily bubbles (kerosene only) and reactive oily bubbles (kerosene containing fatty acids) approaching collophane particles were studied by measurements of zeta potential, induction time and contact angle. The reactive oily bubble shows negligible effects on the zeta potential of collophane particles. A shorter induction time of reactive oily bubble was found at pH\u00a06.0 and/or at pH\u00a09.0 relative to the conventional air bubbles and the oily bubbles. This suggests a strong collection power of reactive oily bubble. Advancing contact angles of the reactive oily bubble on collophane increased dramatically with pH. At pH\u00a09.0, a contact angle of 120 degrees was observed where the reactive oily bubble flotation is anticipated. Micro-flotation results demonstrate the superiority of reactive oily bubbles over air bubbles for collophane flotation. A concentrate containing 35.67% of P2O5 and 0.39% of MgO was obtained using reactive oily bubble flotation at pH\u00a09.0. Micro-flotation results also show that Ca2\u00a0+ and Mg2\u00a0+ ions have a negative effect on the collophane flotation, but the effect of reactive oily bubble system is smaller than that of air bubble system.",

This work describes an alternative process for the recovery of these materials, using mechanical processing and electrostatic separation. Firstly, the batteries are dismantled and their components are characterized. This is followed by comminution, drying (to remove the organic electrolyte), separation according to particle size, and electrostatic separation of the conductive and nonconductive parts of the LIBs. Parameters evaluated in the electrostatic separation were the electrode voltage, roll rotation speed, distance of the electrostatic electrode, and the inclination angle of the deflector. The results showed recovery of a conductive fraction containing 98.98% of metals and a nonconductive fraction containing 99.6% of polymers, demonstrating that electrostatic separation is a promising and efficient method for the recovery of high purity materials from spent LIBs.",

A pilot-scale plant with a daily processing capacity of 500\u00a0kg of dry ores was assembled and tested. SSMRMS involves four steps: feed preparation, solid-state metalized reduction, quenching and ball milling, and magnetic separation. After 40\u00a0days of continuous tests, the operational stability of the proposed technology was good, and accretion did not form in a rotary kiln. Results revealed that (i) an appropriate positive pressure in the kiln terminal was beneficial to metallization; (ii) the overall recoveries of nickel and iron could reach 91.3% and 73.8%, respectively, whereas the nickel and iron grades of the produced ferronickel concentrate could be 7.4% and 69.6%, respectively; (iii) residual nickel to tailings was 0.16%; and (iv) the return ratio of dusts was approximately 8%. Notably, nickel could be released and sufficiently metalized at an appropriate temperature once the structures of the Ni-bearing silicates were destroyed in the presence of fluorite. The metalized nickel aggregated with the metalized iron surrounding the margins of the minerals. Therefore, fluorite could promote the generation and growth of ferronickel alloy particles, thereby increasing the recoveries of nickel and iron. Preliminary calculation showed that the electricity consumption of the solid-state metalized process was 52.5\u00a0kWh/t-ore. Hence, SSMRMS is a competitive strategy for the processing of magnesium-rich nickel oxide ores.",

In addition to the feed rate, the effect of particle size on separation performance was also discussed. Laboratory studies included a selection of material, sample preparation, and optical sorting tests with magnesite, quartz, lignite, hematite, copper and gold ore samples. Experimental studies performed with different size fractions at varying feed rates were followed by evaluation of results with ROC (receiver operating characteristics) graphs. Recovery, grade, and capacity indicators are important to define the efficiency of the optical sorting. Alternatively, ROCs highlight missing particles and false alarm rates, which are used to characterize set points and detectability of the equipment/operation. In the tests performed with quartz and magnesite samples, % weights of valuable (white) and non\u2013valuable (colored) particles in products were directly used to express the performance of optical sorting with ROC. Additionally, % Fe content, % dry ash content, % copper recovery and % gold recovery figures were used to define the ROC parameters for hematite, lignite, copper and gold ore samples.Results showed that the performance of the VIS type optical sorter mainly depends on correctly sorted amounts of valuable and non\u2013valuable particles. Alongside with the evaluation of change in sorting performances in accordance with feed rate, ore type, and particle size; pre-concentration of copper and gold ores, concentration of hematite from alkaline waste, dry cleaning of lignite and market quality magnesite and quartz sorting applications with VIS type optical sorter were also discussed.",

     "abstract": "In many parts of the world, important reserves of Microscopic Biogenous Sediments or Pelagic Sediments occur which primarily consist of settled siliceous or calcareous microorganisms. Such sediments typically have zones, in which an intimate association of siliceous remains of diatoms and CaCO3 is experienced. The purity of diatomite crude ores is very important for producing the filter grade finished products by means of the conventional flux calcination procedures. Calcination of DE materials with high calcium carbonate is not economically or environmentally friendly. The prime objective of this study was to evaluate the advanced STET tribo-electrostatic separator for the beneficiation of DE having relatively high quantities of CaCO3 to produce a suitable calciner feed for the production of filter grade finished products.In the best operating conditions, the STET technology showed the ability to reduce the calcium carbonate content of a natural-grade DE product from 19.5% to 10.9% which is an acceptable quantity of CaCO3 for calciner feeds. Limitations of the DE recovery process using this technology was primarily due to superficial heterogeneity of some DE particles. The validation process of the beneficiated DE confirmed that the STET technology has the potential for upgrading natural-grade DE products having relatively high quantities of CaCO3 to produce a suitable calciner feed for the production of filter grade finished products with the exception of the brewery industry.",

     "abstract": "The application of coal fly ash magnetic spheres (MSs) in water treatment is limited due to their complex mineral compositions, low magnetism, and large diameters. In this study, MSs were carefully ball milled and magnetically separated to improve their related properties. After the processing, the resultant magnetic ball-milled MSs (MBMSs) show a substantial change in composition, magnetism, and surface property in addition to a decrease in diameter. Compared with those of the original MSs, the Fe percentage, magnetism, and specific surface area of MBMSs are increased by 25.87%, 54.60%, and 810%, respectively. Dispersive spectrometer mapping investigation shows segregated high- and low-Fe areas with different structures in MS. These different structures enable purification. Highly turbid clay water flocculation experiments using MSs as flocculants indicate that MBMSs can cause fast flocculation whereas the compared samples exert less or slight flocculation effect. Zeta potential investigation suggests that the different flocculation effects are due to the change in the point of zero charge (pHPZC). The pHPZC increases from 3.91 for the original MS to 4.96 for MBMS. The reduction in the diameter, as well as the increase in magnetism, surface area, and pHPZC, makes MSs applicable to water treatment.",

However, the reduction time of the pre-oxidized ilmenite concentrate was longer than that of the original ilmenite concentrate for the same reaction degree; therefore, a slow reduction rate for the oxidization sample was observed.

Pure dodecane was chosen as research object, the interfacial interactions between quartz particle and oil drop were investigated through calculation of the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (EDLVO) potential energy profile. Based on the calculations of the van der Waals attractive interaction potential, hydrophobic interaction potential, hydrocarbon chain association potential, and electrostatic interaction potential, the results indicated that the mineral particle and oil drop attachment state was mainly dominated by hydrophobic interaction potential. In the modification of oil agglomeration flotation process, the adsorption of DDA on the dodecane/water interface presented significant effects on the interfacial interactions between quartz particle and oil drop. It was found that the adsorption of DDA at dodecane/water interface changed the zeta potential value of oil drop from negative to positive. In this case, the attachment of the particles would occur spontaneously, which was due to the contribution of electric double layer attractive interaction. On the contrary, in the traditional oil agglomeration flotation process, a mechanical agitation was required to overcome a potential barrier due to the existence of electric double layer repulsive interaction between the negatively charged oil drops and mineral particles. This study was focus on the theoretical level, and provided some insights into mechanism of oil agglomeration flotation.",

However, the role of surface roughness in the floatability of coal particles has not been sufficiently investigated because coal consists of organic and inorganic materials. This paper is to obtain some insights into the role of surface roughness in the coal surface wettability. In this investigation, Taixi ultra-low-ash coal particles, with ash content of 1.55%, were polished and the polished flat coal surfaces with various roughness were obtained. The attachment time between air bubble and flat coal surface were tested at the water solution without flotation reagents. Throughout this paper, it was found that the attachment time increased with the increase of roughness of coal surface. The attachment area between bubble and flat coal surface was decreased with the increase of surface roughness. The attachment between bubble and flat rough coal surface was unstable, compared to the attachment between bubble and smooth coal surface. The rougher coal surface makes the detachment between bubble and coal surface easier than the smoother coal surface. The higher the roughness of coal surface is, the more pores and grooves the coal surface has. The pores, gaps and grooves are filled up with the water in the slurry and have negative effects on the attachment between bubble and flat coal surface.",

In this paper, in order to study the influences of oil structures on the non-polar oil assisted dodecylamine (DDA) flotation of quartz, the research focuses on the interaction of DDA (collector) and non-polar oil (collector extender) in aqueous phase. In this work, saturated hydrocarbon dodecane and cyclohexane, unsaturated hydrocarbon dodecene, aromatic hydrocarbon dimethylbenzene and 1-methylnaphthalene were chosen as researched subjects, and the influences of oil structures on interfacial activity of oil\u2013DDA\u2013water ternary models were investigated by experimental and theoretical methods.

The same trends are obtained from the parameters described above, aromatic hydrocarbon dimethylbenzene and 1-methylnaphthalene performance better than saturate hydrocarbon and unsaturated hydrocarbon. The researched results indicate the interaction between non-polar oil and DDA hydrophobic alkyl tail would enhance the mobility of oil component, which induce significant change of interfacial thickness and diffusivity. Additionally, the interaction between DDA hydrophilic head group and water molecules via strong hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions and weak electrostatic attraction would lead to water molecules penetrate through DDA monolayer and adsorb on oil surface. The researches enable us to obtain a deeper microscopic-level understanding of the interaction between oil-DDA-water ternary components, and maybe have some references for designing of oil-assisted flotation agent.",

It would lead to the substantial loss of caustic soda during Bayer processing. With the gradual reduction of the economic reserves of high-grade ore, people began to focus on the desiliconization treatment of the low-grade ore at reasonable cost. Biodesilication by silicate bacteria (such as Paenibacillus mucilaginosus) has been known as a potential technology for its characteristics of environmental protection, energy saving and sustainable development. In this paper, one silicate bacterial isolate with high desilication ability was screened, identified, and named as Paenibacillus mucilaginosus BM-4. The optimum cultural pH and temperature of BM-4 were also determined experimentally as 8.0 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Under these optimum cultural conditions, silicate ores were bioleached by BM-4. It seems that the stratified structures silicate ores, such as kaolinite and chlorite, were more readily to be leached by BM-4.On the other hand, the float-abilities of BM-4 on kaolinite and bauxite were also investigated. With the experimental results shown that there existed the electrostatic adsorption process between BM-4 and kaolinite, and the Langmuir isotherm adsorption process between BM-4 and bauxite. It was observed that the float-abilities of bauxite were significantly depressed by BM-4, while the those of kaolinite were enhanced. The bioflotation test of the mixture of bauxite and kaolinite (mass ratio 5:1) through BM-4 were carried out by a modified Hallimond tube. With results shown that the Al/Si ratios of this mixed minerals were improved from 3.05 to 8.60 after bacterial conditioning due to bauxite depression. Eventually, 83.0% of Al2O3 were recovered from the mixed minerals by BM-4.",

HGMS in centrifugal field (CHGMS) is proposed to improve the separation selectivity, and in this investigation a cyclic pilot-scale CHGMS separator was used to concentrate fine ilmenites from slurry. The theoretical descriptions on this CHGMS process indicate that the introduction of centrifugal field in the HGMS field has a promoting effect on the magnetic capture of matrix to magnetic particles and significantly improves the HGMS performance, and a minimum critical magnetic field force is required for the capture of magnetic particles in the centrifugal field. These theoretical descriptions were experimentally verified and the dependence of CHGMS performance on the key parameters such as centrifugal acceleration was determined. This CHGMS method has achieved a significantly improved separation selectivity and performance to the fine ilmenite, and thus provided a potential prospect in the development of CHGMS technology.",

Chalcopyrite leaching was affected only by time, not irrigation rate, acid delivery rate, or column height. This indicated that chalcopyrite heap leaching was reaction-limited rather than transport-limited, and therefore relatively impervious to scale. The findings suggest that chalcopyrite could be leached in substantially taller heaps, releasing proportionally greater quantities of copper, without sacrificing recovery. Leaching of the chalcopyrite ore had little effect on its floatability, as indicated by rougher flotation testing. The maximum flotation recoveries, RMAX, were 90% and 88% for the ore and leached residues, respectively. The combined leach/float recoveries were greater than the individual copper recoveries from leaching and flotation alone. This was simply due to the initial leaching step recovering some of the copper that would have been inevitably lost to flotation tailings. Such a leach/float approach may actually benefit from the low reactivity of chalcopyrite, which ensures that leaching would never be so extensive as to affect the later floatability of the mineral.",

     "abstract": "The paper presents strategies for control of parallel gravitational coal separation processes in dense media vessels and jigs. These strategies are designed to maximize the yield of the final product at the desired ash content. The principle of circuits operating in parallel at equal incremental ash contents has been discussed from the point of view of its practical application. In the case of an ideal separation process this principle can be reduced to the requirement of equal separation densities for parallel circuits; so far, however, it has not been applied in real industrial processes. The paper includes a discussion on the concept of a separation density and incremental ash for computer simulation of parallel processes and their control. Conclusions from this discussion, presented in the paper are not available in open literature especially as regards the optimal control of jigs operating in parallel: (a) the separation density (elementary ash) defined as the density of the feed fraction reporting in half to the concentrate and in half to refuse and incremental ash (density of the elementary mass of material recovered in a process in which the yield is increased by an infinitesimally small amount) can be used for real time control in dense media baths and in jigs; (b) the autogenous separation process in jigs makes it possible to determine the incremental ash as the ash content in the separation layer of the material as measured by the correlation between ash content and the density of the separation layer. The concept of a new control system which may be used in practice, based on a radiometric density meter with a properly collimated radiation beam and located at the level of the separation layer has been discussed. The radiometric density meters, applied to monitor the density of the separation layer in jigs on-line and to monitor the density of heavy media in dense media baths can be used effectively in real-time control systems optimizing the yield of product.",

     "abstract": "In this paper, leaching kinetics of yttrium from cathode ray tubes in sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide solution was investigated. It was found that hydrogen peroxide concentration, followed by temperature, has the greatest influence on leaching rate. Leaching rate is clearly enhanced by the increase in H2O2 concentration. The leaching process without hydrogen peroxide follows the kinetic model controlled by the chemical regime, whereas in presence of H2O2 it follows the kinetic model controlled by diffusion through the product layer. The apparent activation energy was determined to be 40.0\u00a0kJ/mol and 90.3\u00a0kJ/mol with and without hydrogen peroxide in solution, respectively. Moreover, the experimental data were used to describe empirical mathematical models in order to predict the yttrium extraction as a function of sulphuric acid concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration, temperature and time. From the analysis of the results and models, the optimal conditions to maximize the extraction of yttrium were inferred: 40\u00a0\u00b0C, 10%vol hydrogen peroxide, 15\u00a0min of reaction with 15%wt/vol pulp density, or alternatively at higher temperature (80\u00a0\u00b0C) 15%wt/vol pulp density, 120\u2013180\u00a0min with 0% or 5%vol hydrogen peroxide in solution.

The results suggest that an increase in the iodine value of oleic acid would lead to improved flotation separation of diaspore from aluminosilicates. Use of the commercial oleic acid with iodine value of 131 in closed-circuit flotation tests allowed us to obtain a concentrate with alumina-to-silica (A/S) ratio of 5.33 and alumina recovery of 85.56% from the feed ore (A/S ratio\u00a0=\u00a03.39).

To fundamentally understand the correlation between the iodine value of commercial oleic acids and the efficiency of flotation separation of diaspore from aluminosilicates, the computational studies of frontier molecular orbital energy of oleic and linoleic acid were done, and the results suggest that linoleic acid has higher chemical activity than oleic acid and its chemical adsorption on diaspore is more stable than that of oleic acid.",

In order to determine the impurity specific thresholds related to the formation of suspended solids, synthetic copper electrorefining electrolytes with different concentrations of arsenic, antimony and bismuth were investigated by a continuous filtration method. The amount and composition of the floating slimes obtained were evaluated in terms of the initial impurity concentrations present in the synthetic electrolyte. As a result, the specific influence of arsenic, antimony and bismuth on the floating slime formation was ascertained. The results suggest that there is an upper limit in electrorefining electrolytes for antimony (Sb) of 800\u00a0mg/L for floating slime formation, although the limit for Bi was less clear. Furthermore, the structure of the synthetic floating precipitates produced were analyzed using both SEM-EDS and XRD and showed typical amorphous structure of floating slimes with particle size of approximately 25\u00a0\u03bcm and predicted composition of BiAsO4, SbAsO4, Sb2O3 and Bi2O3.",

     "abstract": "As an experimental study, the research in this paper was conducted to illustrate the influence of solids content and composition of cemented paste backfill (CPB) on the material's rheological and mechanical characteristics. A new type of CPB was used in this research, which was composed of waste rock as coarse aggregates, fly ash as fines, lime slag as activator proportions and ordinary Portland cement as binder. The mechanical strength of CPB improved significantly with an increase in the solids content, but the workability decreased because the water content decreased. When the solids content was 75% by weight (wt.%), the slump value was 165\u00a0mm, which met the requirement for pumping. At a solids content of 75%, the CPB also had an unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of 1.83\u00a0MPa, tensile strength of 0.401\u00a0MPa, and Poisson's ratio of 0.136 at a curing time of 28\u00a0days. Increasing the fly ash proportion caused the workability and mechanical strength of the CPB to increase until they reached maximum values, at which point subsequent increases caused the values to decrease. The workability of CPB reached its peak when fly ash proportion was 35\u00a0wt.%, and the mechanical strength reached its peak at 45\u00a0wt.%. The workability of CPB decreased as the lime slag proportion increased. The strength of CPB also increased with an increase in the lime slag proportion, however, only until it reached 12\u00a0wt.%, at which point the strength began to decline. The addition of more cement resulted in much better mechanical performance of the CPB samples, especially with longer curing times. However, workability of CPB increased as cement portion increased in the range of 0% to 2.5%, before decreasing over the range of 2.5%\u20135.0%.",

     "abstract": "Accurate characterisation of ore competence through controlled single particle impact can enable improved modelling of comminution process response to ore variability. A simple relationship is presented to relate the energy input and feed particle size to the breakage progeny with two fitting parameters. Previous techniques have focused either on low energy repeated impacts or high energy single impacts and have been applied over relatively small ranges of particle sizes. The method presented builds on previous understanding to unite these two disparate fields on feed particle sizes over more than two orders of magnitude. The method has been tested on 5 ores from 37.5\u00a0mm to 250\u00a0\u03bcm over energies from 0.02 to 3.5\u00a0kWh/t. The resultant standard error of 3.3% is lower than other benchmarked models, with considerably fewer fitting parameters and no use of splining functions required. The direct calculation of appearance function for any feed size and input energy renders the proposed model well suited to incorporation in comminution process models. Further testing is required on additional ores, and further interpretation is required to obtain mechanistic explanations for the empirical fits to the model parameters.",

     "abstract": "Coal desulfurization is imperative to creating clean coal and reducing harmful emissions during the burning process. Due to the lack of effective technology in the field of fine coal dry separation, a novel microwave-enhanced magnetic property processing method was demonstrated in this manuscript. Using representative simulated minerals, the response and absorption characteristics of coal pyrite were intuitively demonstrated while analyzing the selective absorption mechanisms of different minerals in fine coal. Results show that the coal pyrites from Inner Mongolia were reduced by approximately 20% after 60\u00a0s of microwave treatment, and 60% after 90\u00a0s. The binding energy and chemical shift were quite large when the oxidation state was high. Fe2\u00a0+ and troilite FeS were oxidized to Fe2O3 after 60\u00a0s microwave treatment, and to Fe3\u00a0+ after 90\u00a0s. Dynamic equilibrium was reached after 3\u00a0min of microwave treatment. The conversion rate was lower for pyrite to pyrrhotite than for pyrrhotite to troilite. The conversion of pyrrhotite to troilite appeared to be sensitive to the amount of microwave treatment. The specific susceptibility dropped rapidly and was nearly an order of magnitude greater than the raw coal. This study indicates a high possibility for coal desulfurization through this dry method enhanced with microwave energy.",

Different EVA/VE amounts (7.5 to 20\u00a0wt% of cement mass) are examined in CPB mixtures. To assess the influence of EVA/VE on the CPBs consistency (fresh state), slump height was measured using a small Abram's cone. Uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) testing was conducted to determine the influence of polymer powder on the mechanical strength development of CPBs, and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) were used to determine the influence of polymer powder on the microstructure and mineralogy of hardened CPBs. The achieved results implicated the dependency of polymer powder effectiveness on the tailings type. Of the different polymer powder proportions used in this study, the addition of 15% EVA/VE (based on the mass of binder) was only effective in improving UCS values of sulfidic tailings.

To quantify the hydrophilicity, the quantum chemistry calculation was used to calculate the hydrogen bonding energies in the wetting process by DFT B3LYP 6-31G. It is known that the floatability of lignite is much lower than that of the high-volatile bituminous coal from the natural floatability test. Besides, the hydrophilic sites were mainly oxygen functional groups. From XPS results, it is indicated that there were four kinds of oxygen functional groups, including OH, CO, CO and COOH in lignite, while there were three kinds of oxygen functional groups, containing OH, CO and CO in the high-volatile bituminous coal. On the other hand, the simulation results showed that the hydrogen bonding energy of these hydrophilic sites are in the following order\u00a0\u2212\u00a0COOH\u00a0>\u00a0\u2212\u00a0OH\u00a0>\u00a0C\u00a0\u2212\u00a0O\u00a0>\u00a0C\u00a0=\u00a0O. The released hydrogen-bonding energies were calculated to be 2.36\u00a0kcal/mol for lignite and 1.31\u00a0kcal/mol for high-volatile bituminous coal, respectively. In addition, the calorimetric experiments also showed that the wetting heats were 105.37\u00a0J/g (lignite) and 47.00\u00a0J/g (high-volatile bituminous coal). The hydrogen bond energy distribution of each hydrophilic sites showed that all the four kind hydrophilic sites impacted the lignite hydrophilicity remarkably whereas only OH and CO affected the hydrophilicity of high-volatile bituminous coal. It was revealed that the difficulty in lignite flotation was dominated by the complex contribution to hydrophilicity of the oxygen functional groups.",

However, extracting nickel from laterite ores differs from sulfides because nickel contained minerals are generally disseminated throughout the ore. Laterites cannot be concentrated using classic mineral processing techniques such as flotation.The present study proposes a new smelting process for limonitic nickeliferous laterite ore in order to separate nickel and cobalt from the ore and produce a nickel matte at lower smelting temperature compared with the current industrial techniques. The nickel and cobalt recoveries were evaluated at various flux additions. The highest recovery condition for Ni (98% Ni recovery with Ni content of 10\u00a0wt%) was achieved with the addition of 27\u00a0g of flux (50%Na2CO3\u00a0+\u00a035%Na2B4O7\u00b710H2O\u00a0+\u00a015%SiO2), 0.8\u00a0g coke and 5\u00a0g elemental sulfur to 25\u00a0g of the roasted ore.

The smithsonite was depressed by the cations Ca2\u00a0+ and Mg2\u00a0+ and, the dolomite was depressed by Zn2\u00a0+ cations, which was probably caused by the reaction of these cations with the oleate anions in the solution, decreasing the concentration of collector available for adsorption onto the minerals. The powerful depression of smithsonite caused by Ca2\u00a0+ cations compared with that caused by Mg2\u00a0+ cations can be considered to have occurred because of the higher concentration of Ca2\u00a0+ in the solution. From the zeta potential measurements at pH\u00a09.5, we concluded that the predominant species of oleate and of sodium silicate were adsorbed onto both minerals, and the silicate species prevented the adsorption of oleate anions onto dolomite. The decrease in the negative zeta potential of both minerals after cation conditioning can be related to the electrostatic attraction between the cations and the negative sites on their surfaces. The negative zeta potential of smithsonite increased at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M Ca2\u00a0+ and Mg2\u00a0+, whereas the potential decreases at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03\u00a0M, which can be related to a lower concentration of oleate anions being available for adsorption.",

     "abstract": "The influence of acid surface dissolution as a pretreatment method on the improvement of ilmenite selective flotation from olivine-pyroxene was studied by carrying out the flotation experiments in micro and laboratory (flotation cell) scales. The microflotation experiments show that after surface dissolution, the flotation recovery of ilmenite improves from 73.5% to 92.1% at a pH of 6.3, while that of olivine-pyroxene decreases from 59.6% to 44.6%. The improvement of ilmenite floatability is in good accordance with the relative content of Fe3\u00a0+ in ilmenite surface which increases from 48.5% to 59.8% after surface dissolution as evidenced by XPS analysis. This conversion increases the formation of an insoluble layer of ferric iron oleate, and enhances ilmenite hydrophobicity. FTIR spectra and zeta potential measurements indicated that the adsorption of oleate ions on the surface of olivine-pyroxene decreases significantly after surface dissolution. As evidenced by ICP analysis, this can be due to the dissolution of Fe cations as the active sites from the olivine-pyroxene surface. The cell flotation experiments show that before surface dissolution, an optimal concentrate with 21.2% TiO2 and 78.3% recovery is achieved using 1000\u00a0g/t sodium oleate, 100\u00a0g/t Pb(NO3)2 (activator) and 80\u00a0g/t quebracho (depressant).

According to the FTIR analysis, it showed an obvious decline in the hydrophilic groups while an increase in the hydrophobic groups on the surface of coal after pretreatment by 2-ethylhexanol solution for 12 h, resulting in the increase of contact angle from 74.9\u00b0 to 95.4\u00b0. Whereas the induction time showed a significant decrease from 246.0\u00a0ms down to 85.4\u00a0ms, which meant the better hydrophobicity and floatability of coal particles after the pretreatment. As a result, a better flotation efficiency of low rank coal was attained after the pretreatment. Additionally, the oily bubble flotation combining 2-ethylhexanol was employed to enhance the flotation of coal samples. The results indicated that the mixture of diesel oil and 2-ethylhexanol improved the collecting power and selectivity of oily bubbles, with the oil contact angle for coal samples decreasing from 17.8\u00b0 to 14.5\u00b0 and the induction time from 50\u00a0ms down to 19.7\u00a0ms.

     "abstract": "A simple theoretical model has been developed for the solvent extraction of cations with different oxidation states varying from +1 to +4 using acidic extractants. The basic assumption behind this theoretical model is that the cationic species (Mn+) will exist in ionic form and not form any complexes in the aqueous phase. A direct relationship between the concentration of metal ions in the aqueous phase and that in the organic phase was developed for trivalent and tetravalent cationic species. Using this model, the distribution isotherms were plotted for a given set of conditions. The effect of pH and equilibrium constant on the distribution isotherms were represented in three-dimensional form for trivalent and tetravalent cationic species. Consistent with expectations, the results suggest that with increasing pH and an increasing equilibrium constant one finds an enhancement of the extraction of cationic species for a given set of conditions. The calculations were performed in the pH range of 1 through 3 because for higher pH values, the pH shift accompanying the extraction is significant and thereby affects the mass balance equations. A comparison of the distribution isotherms shows that the total metal ion concentration to extractant concentration ratio determines the distribution behavior of metal ions with different valency. At low total metal ion concentration to extractant concentration ratio, the distribution coefficient was higher for higher oxidation state cations under similar experimental conditions, and this trend started to reverse when the total metal ion concentration to extractant concentration ratio was increased.",

     "abstract": "To elucidate how phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as a depressant achieves selective separation of apatite and dolomite, the flotation response of these minerals was investigated using both single and mixed mineral flotation. Microflotation results demonstrated that H3PO4 exhibits a selective depressive effect on apatite. Flotation kinetics analyses also revealed that the presence of H3PO4 increases the dolomite/apatite selectivity index significantly. The adsorption mechanisms were examined using zeta potential tests, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, solution chemistry analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. H2PO4\u2212 was found to be the pivotal ion for depressing apatite under slightly acidic conditions (pH\u00a0=\u00a05.0\u20136.0), where the separation of these minerals most effective. H2PO4\u2212 reacts with free Ca2\u00a0+ to depress the acidolysis of apatite and promote the formation of aqueous CaHPO4. H3PO4 chemisorbs onto apatite surface by the formation of aqueous CaHPO4 and Ca(H2PO4)2, with the former being the major species to depress apatite. Moreover, dissolution of Mg2\u00a0+ and Ca2\u00a0+ from the dolomite surface is thermodynamically more favorable than that of Ca2\u00a0+ from the apatite surface. As Mg(H2PO4)2 is soluble, H3PO4 only exhibits a weak depressive effect on dolomite. Further, the collector (sodium oleate) maintains excellent dolomite floatability in the presence of H3PO4, because chemisorption of the collector on the dolomite surface is enhanced by reaction with abundant Mg2\u00a0+. Therefore, H3PO4 selectively depresses apatite in the apatite/dolomite flotation system.",

The single mineral flotation experiments show that the maximum differences between the floatability of pyrolusite and calcite occurring at a pH of 7.5 in the presence of DTAC is more than that of DDA. This means that DTAC acts more selectively than the DDA collector. In the microflotation experiments carried out on the artificially mixed minerals, the MnO content and recovery in the pyrolusite concentrate obtained by DDA collector is greater than that achieved by DTAC. As evidenced by ore flotation results and contact angle measurements, in the presence of both collectors, sodium carbonate acts more effective than calcium chloride as calcite depressant agents. In the ore flotation experiments, a pyrolusite concentrate containing higher MnO grade and recovery is obtained using DDA collector in comparison with DTAC. These results indicate that the collecting power of DDA is significantly more than DTAC collector.

     "abstract": "A cationic organic silicone surfactant (DTA) with specially designed functional groups was developed as a flotation collector for smithsonite. This surfactant was synthesized via the reaction between hexaethyldisiloxane and N-\u03b2-(aminoethyl)-\u03b3-aminoisobutylmethyldimethoxy silane using tetramethylammonium hydroxide as a catalyst. Its flotation performance was validated by flotation tests using pure minerals. The results illustrated that DTA has strong collecting ability and better selectivity for smithsonite against quartz, calcite and dolomite compared to the traditional collectors such as octadecylamine, tetradecylamine and dodecylamine. Based on the analysis of FTIR spectra, zeta-potential measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, it can be concluded that the adsorption mechanism of DTA on the surface of smithsonite was mainly dominated by chemisorption and electrostatic adsorption. DTA's unique properties, which include two coordination sites (NH2 and NH), and the \u201cparachute\u201d shape structure of OSi(C2H5)3, resulted in superior collecting powers for smithsonite.",

     "abstract": "Associated minerals in the raw coal increase the energy consumption and abrasion of grinding media of vertical spindle pulverizer (VSP). Moreover, the low separating efficiency of classifier in VSP leads to the return of fines to grinding table, worsens the grinding phenomenon and make the energy-size reduction of coal complex. Beneficiation of fines rejected by classifier is helpful to save energy and decreases the air pollution caused by the combustion of minerals in fines. Aiming to evaluate the potential for beneficiating the circulating loads, multi-analytical techniques are utilized to the raw coal and ground products. Phase composition analyses of raw coal show that kaolinite is the main mineral. Comparison of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) of coal before and after comminution illustrates the liberation of kaolinite from coal substance, and the measurement of charge-mass ratios indicates the opposite polarity of tribocharge between coal and minerals, which indicates the separating possibility based on difference in the electric physics. Removal results of minerals from circulating loads by the triboelectrostatic separator vary with product fineness and liberation degrees. The best separation result is obtained on the finest progenies produced with the yield and ash content of clean coal at 61.95% and 18.92%, respectively.",

     "abstract": "The reactivity of cemented paste tailings (CPT) that contains sulphide mineral-bearing tailings is a key parameter that influences its environmental performance and durability. This reactivity can be influenced by several factors, such as the initial sulphate content of the CPT. In this paper, the effect of the initial sulphate content of the CPT on its reactivity is experimentally investigated by conducting oxygen consumption (OC) tests on CPT specimens. Microstructural testing is also conducted on CPT specimens to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the changes in the reactivity of CPT. These specimens are prepared by mixing defined amounts of pyritic tailings (45\u00a0wt%), varying proportions of Portland cement type I or Portland cement partially replaced with different types and amounts of mineral admixtures, and mixing water with various sulphate contents (0, 5000, 15,000 and 25,000\u00a0ppm). The samples are cured for 150\u00a0days at room temperature. The results show that regardless of the type of binder, the reactivity of the CPT specimens increases with increasing contents of sulphate except for a sulphate content of 5000\u00a0ppm. Also, partial substitution of Portland cement type I with mineral admixtures, such as granulated blast furnace slag or fly ash, reduces the chemical reactivity. Regardless of the initial sulphate content, increasing the cement content and/or replacing cement with mineral admixtures leads to the reduction in the reactivity of the paste.",

The selected NIR-active minerals were arranged along the view of NIR line scanner to stimulate adjacent natural minerals association.It was found that spectral dominance may depend on minerals near infrared sensitivity and or the position of a mineral along the NIR scanner line of view.

     "abstract": "To date, the quest for cost-effective methods for removal of dissolved metals from aqueous solutions remains a daunting challenge for many industries. This paper reports on the development of an effective, hybrid adsorbent for selective copper recovery from aqueous solutions under industrially relevant conditions. The work involved (i) purification and functionalization of diatomaceous earth (DE) particles with glutaraldehyde(GA)-crosslinked polyethyleneimine(PEI), (ii) physicochemical characterization of the product and (iii) metal adsorption from solutions containing Cu(II)/Ni(II)/Fe(II)/Ca(II)/Mg(II)/Mn(II)/Al(III)/Na ions and their subsequent elution behaviour. Acid leaching of the pristine DE led to a significant reduction in its metal oxide (e.g., Al2O3, Fe2O3) constituents and a concomitant increase in both SiO2 content and specific surface area. Upon functionalization with GA-crosslinked PEI, the DE particles' interfacial chemistry was completely altered to that of the polymer with no change in specific surface area. Isothermal batch adsorption from saline (15\u00a0g/dm3 NaCl) and non-saline solutions containing 500 and 1000\u00a0mg/dm3 of Cu at ~\u00a0pH\u00a04 revealed >\u00a097% Cu(II) removal by functionalized DE within 3\u00a0min in both cases. Subsequent water elution tests at pH\u00a01 showed complete release of the adsorbed Cu confirming pH-dependent interaction between dissolved Cu and GA-crosslinked PEI. The preliminary batch adsorption/elution tests involving 1000\u00a0mg/dm3 solutions of Ni, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Na and Al showed little or negligible affinity of the functionalized DE towards these elements, suggesting good selectivity for Cu. Furthermore, it is shown that the functionalized particles are chemically stable at H2SO4 concentrations up to 2\u00a0M and may be recycled >\u00a010 times without loss in their Cu adsorption/desorption performance.",

The variables were: the ratio of NaOH to fly ash, water, the filtrate (post-reaction solutions obtained during the hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites rich in Si), and the amount of added aluminium foil. The analysis showed that three of the most effective reactions (from which Samples 21\u201323 were derived) occurred under the following conditions: the ratio of NaOH/fly ash was 1.6, 2.0 and 1.25, respectively, with a fusion temperature of 550\u00a0\u00b0C (for each of the three reactions), fusion time of 1\u00a0h and reaction time of 4\u00a0h (for each of the three reactions); the amount of H2O was 100, 100 and 50\u00a0ml; the amount of filtrate was 0, 0 and 50\u00a0ml; the amount of added aluminium foil was 0.5\u00a0g (for each of the three reactions); and the reaction temperature was 80\u00a0\u00b0C (for each of the three reactions).

The baffle is a plate located perpendicular to the cross section of the column with a length of 2.8\u00a0m and thickness of 0.4\u00a0cm. The computational domain is a column with a circular cross section having a height of 3.2\u00a0m and a diameter of 10\u00a0cm. Three-dimensional simulations were executed using Eulerian two-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models for both non-baffled and baffled columns. In order to reduce computing demand and simplify the problem, it was assumed that the column is already filled with water, and air enters from the lateral and upper surfaces of a cylindrical sparger with a length of 15\u00a0cm and a diameter of 1\u00a0cm located vertically at the bottom of the column. To validate the simulation results, a series of laboratory flotation column experiments have been performed under the above-mentioned conditions. Three-dimensional simulations were executed using an Eulerian two-phase model for both non-baffled and baffled columns. The simulated pressure values on the wall at 0.2\u00a0m and 2.8\u00a0m height of the non-baffled column were in good agreement with experimentally measured values with the highest relative difference of <\u00a03.07%. Comparison of the computational results for the non-baffled and baffled columns showed that baffling can reduce water axial velocity up to 16.96%, which consequently reduces the axial mixing in the column and increases flotation recovery.

     "abstract": "There is little in-depth study on the downstream processing characteristics of granulated PGM-containing converter matte, particularly related to grinding and liberation behavior closely associated with leaching, and also as a function of iron endpoint specific mineralogy. Moreover, there is limited physical property data available, such as hardness and breakage of converter matte mineral structures that allows for considering a possible dependence between the mineralogy and the downstream processing characteristics of converter matte. The aim of this study was to investigate a relationship between indentation hardness, breakage and the mineralogy of two different iron end point converter mattes namely Fe_0.15% and Fe_5.17%. This also allowed for a subsequent investigation to relate the mineralogy to the integrated downstream processing characteristics of granulated converter matte.A Nano-indentation tester was used to measure the indentation hardness of mineral structures. The indentation system also had the ability to test the breakage characteristics of the respective mineral structures by applying a preset load. Laboratory batch grinding tests were conducted at various specific energies with respect to granulated high and low iron mattes. A high resolution field-emission scanning electron microscope was utilized for mineralogical analysis. The perfect mixing ball mill model was subsequently used to assess the breakage rates of matte particles and minerals. A mineral liberation analyzer was used to investigate the liberation characteristics of mineral structures of interest.The investigations revealed that the minerals and associated boundaries showed relatively different indentation hardness. The indentation-induced breakage of nickel sulfide, copper sulfide and NiCu-alloy structures appeared preferential and related to the iron end point. The softest mineral was found to be copper sulfide, which exhibited the average indentation hardness of 1975 and 2978\u00a0MPa within the low and high iron matte respectively. The increasingly harder minerals were nickel sulfide and NiCu-alloy in both low and high iron mattes with mean values around 5000\u00a0MPa. The laboratory batch grinding of the converter mattes at specific energy inputs resulted in product size distributions correlated to the underlying mineralogy. Although the trends for the breakage rates was found to be similar for both mattes, the matte with Fe content of 5.17% exhibited higher breakage rates in the specific energy ranges from 5\u00a0kWh/t to 25\u00a0kWh/t. This indicated that the matte with 5.17% Fe produces finer product than that of the 0.15% Fe matte at the same energy level. Moreover, a higher degree of overall liberation was achieved for copper sulfide and NiCu-alloy present within the high iron matte particles compared to particles within the low iron matte. 40% of particles within the high iron matte are completely liberated at 5\u00a0kWh/t specific energy, in contrast to about 20% within the low iron matte. However, Ni extraction achieved during leaching of minerals within the high iron matte was lower as opposed to minerals of the low iron matte. This was attributed to favorable Ni mineralization and chemistry of the low Fe matte which appears to be the most important driver for the downstream processing.",

The results of the microflotation experiments indicate that DAA exhibits good flotation performance to both ilmenite and titanaugite at a pH\u00a0>\u00a06.0. The flotation separation of ilmenite from titanaugite can be performed using the mixed NaOL-DAA in a wide pH range of 5.0\u20137.0. In this pH range, the recovery of ilmenite remains constant at approximately 90%, while the recovery of titanaugite remains <\u00a025%. The best separation result can be achieved with NaOL-DAA molar ratios of 10:1. The results of the zeta potential experiments and the FTIR analyses indicate that the adsorption of the mixed collector, NaOL-DAA, on the ilmenite surface is larger than on the titanaugite surface and that the NaOL-DAA complex might be mainly adsorbed on the ilmenite surface by chemical adsorption, apart from electrostatic adsorption. The synthetic mineral mixture micro-flotation results demonstrate that, compared to NaOL, NaOL-DAA not only increases the recovery and grade of the TiO2 by 7.02% and 6.71%, respectively, but also decreases the reagent consumption by half.",

     "abstract": "Static leaching experiments were performed to detect the heavy metals release rule of stone coal waste rocks at different solution pH levels. Results showed that solution pH exerted a significant influence on mineral dissolution. As solution pH decreased, the dissolved quantities of minerals increased gradually. With leaching time progressing, the dissolved quantities of Cr and V at each experimental pH level increased almost all the way, while As and Cd dissolved quickly at first and then the dissolution decreased. The dissolved quantities of major elements in the stone coal waste rocks were also detected.Ca and Mg dissolution increased rapidly in the beginning and then decreased slowly; however, the dissolved quantities of Al and Fe were relatively low. The maximum dissolved quantities at a solution pH of 2 were observed in the following order: Ca (2695.65\u00a0mg/kg)\u00a0>\u00a0Mg (510.92\u00a0mg/kg)\u00a0>\u00a0Al (23.64\u00a0mg/kg)\u00a0>\u00a0Fe (11.55\u00a0mg/kg)\u00a0>\u00a0V (6861\u00a0\u03bcg/kg)\u00a0>\u00a0Cr (1005.35\u00a0\u03bcg/kg)\u00a0>\u00a0Cd (751.71\u00a0\u03bcg/kg)\u00a0>\u00a0As (323.66\u00a0\u03bcg/kg). It can be seen that the dissolution of the elements is not correlated with their total content in the stone coal waste rocks, but is related with their content in easily soluble fraction (F1). The stone coal waste rocks were found to exhibit a relatively high neutralizing power, in that, in the range of initial solution pH at 3\u20139, final leachate pH stabilized at 8.3\u20138.5. This neutralizing ability was conducive to precipitate newly dissolved heavy metals, thus was favorable for reducing the waste rocks environmental toxicity.",

At the same time, the bed density only declines by 3.7%, and the density standard deviation decreases significantly which is mainly caused by the horizontal motion of the medium. The separation tests indicated that the most appropriate scraper speed is between 0.1\u00a0m/s and 0.3\u00a0m/s and it was reasonable to move the scraper at the appropriate rate to get the better separation performance.",

     "abstract": "Reverse flotation is an effective method for separating apatite from gangue minerals (such as dolomite) in collophanite ore. However, collophanite ore flotation using traditional fatty acid collectors is uneconomical because of the relatively high cost of the raw materials. In this work, saponified gutter oil fatty acid (GOFA) was used as the collector, and its effect on collophanite ore flotation and the mechanism of adsorption were studied. The results showed that Ca2\u00a0+ is the active site for reaction with GOFA and initiates apatite flotation. The dissolution of Ca2\u00a0+ from dolomite was found to be thermodynamically more favorable than that from apatite, and the relative abundance of Ca2\u00a0+ enhanced the reaction of dolomite with GOFA. XPS analysis revealed that the interaction between GOFA and magnesium on the dolomite surface strengthened chemisorption. As magnesium is a major constituent of dolomite, but not of apatite, GOFA was selectively chemisorbed onto the dolomite surface. Closed-circuit reverse flotation tests using GOFA as the collector resulted in an excellent concentrate with 28.46\u00a0wt% P2O5 and 0.65\u00a0wt% MgO, corresponding to a P2O5 recovery of 87.2%. GOFA was demonstrated to exhibit outstanding selectivity for dolomite in the reverse flotation of collophanite ore. The use of GOFA as an environment-friendly, cost-effective, and selective collector is expected to provide new insights into low-cost collophanite ore flotation.",

The influences of reduction conditions, such as reduction temperature and duration, C/Fe molar ratio, grinding fineness and fluorite dose, on the indicators of reduced iron powder were evaluated. Fixed carbon and volatile matter contents were lower in BFD than those in coal. However, reduction and separation of titanium and iron exhibited similar effects on reduction roasting. Results showed that the optimum conditions of roasting reduction included C/Fe molar ratio of 0.65, fluorite dose of 4\u00a0mass%, and roasting temperature of 1300\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min. The reduced iron powder was obtained through two-stage grinding and two-stage magnetic separation of the roasted product. The former contained 94.23\u00a0mass% Fe and 0.58\u00a0mass% TiO2 and showed total iron recovery of 87.62%.

The reduction reaction of synthetic hematite for all carbohydrates starts at a temperature of ~\u00a0350\u00a0\u00b0C, while the reduction of natural hematite for all carbohydrates starts at a temperature of ~\u00a0365\u00a0\u00b0C.

The adsorption mechanism was described as a chemisorption/surface precipitation process. At low OHA concentrations, adsorption occurred by chemisorption as a result of the reaction between surface active sites and OHA molecules. With an increase in concentration and interaction time, surface precipitation occurred. For chemisorption, adsorption was an exothermic and entropy driven process and maximum adsorption was achieved at pH\u00a09.0 due to more active sites. In an acidic environment, such as pH\u00a03.0, adsorption was achieved via chemisorption and hydrophobic bonding. However, a strong basic and higher temperature environment contributes to surface precipitation of basic rare earth hydroxamate.

The effect of prewetting time on the flotation behavior of Taixi oxidized coal had been observed in our previous studies, and it was surmised that the oxidized coal surface was easier wrapped by water shell because the hydrophilic functional groups could be bonded with water through hydrogen bond and the cracks and holes could also be filled up with water when the coal was prewetted in the flotation cell. However, the mechanism of how the prewetting/immersion process can affect the flotation performance of Taixi oxidized coal is still poorly understood and should be investigated clearly. This paper was to conduct the fundamental studies on the effect of prewetting/immersion time in the attachment time between air bubble and Taixi oxidized coal. It was found that the attachment time increased quickly with the increase of prewetting/immersion time. The micro-bubbles are produced on the oxidized coal surface when the coal particles are immersed in the water. The micro-bubbles may be primarily from the air entrapped in the cracks and holes on the oxidized coal surface. As the prewetting/immersion time increased, the micro-bubbles would dissolve and get away from coal surface, and then the cracks and holes would be fully filled up with the water. Finally, the oxidized coal surface would be wrapped by a thick hydration shell which could prevent the oxidized coal surface from being attached by the bubbles, and hence the bubble-coal attachment time increases with the increase of prewetting/immersion time.",

The investigation was done using Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology, the same design of experimental data was used in training with the artificial neural network, and the results obtained from the two methodologies were compared. The ANN model predicted responses with better accuracy with coefficient of determination (R2) 0.97 and 0.95 for % ash rejection and % organic matter recovery respectively in comparison to RSM-BBD R2 of 0.97 and 0.92 for % ash rejection and % organic matter recovery respectively. The optimal condition established for the high % ash rejection and % organic matter recovery were pulp density (3.002%), oil dosage (15%), agglomeration time (15\u00a0min), particle size (0.168\u00a0mm) with predicted % ash rejection and % organic matter recovery as 68.00% and 95.24% respectively, with the desirability of 96.90%. The proposed optimal conditions were examined in the laboratory and the % ash rejection and % organic matter recovery achieved as 64.60% and 93.93 respectively.",

Electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic stacking effect might play important roles in the adsorption towards organic phenols. Owing to the embedded magnetic Fe3O4, the composite was able to be separated easily from liquid media under an external magnetic field.

In this study, column and block experiments are conducted to investigate the coupled evolutions of the main performance characteristics (thermal, hydraulic and mechanical) of CGFB structures. A test apparatus is designed and equipped to investigate the thermal (temperature development), hydraulic (water drainage) and mechanical (lateral expansion) performances of CGFB columns under pressure in drained and laterally constrained conditions. The CGFBs are cured at room temperature and monitored for 30\u00a0days. Additionally, water drainage and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of CGFB blocks at different curing temperatures (20 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C) are also tested. The results indicate that the hydraulic and mechanical behaviors of the CGFBs are significantly affected by thermal factors (heat generated by binder hydration and heat transfer between the CGFB and its surroundings). This study will contribute to a better understanding of the thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of underground CGFB structures, and thus a better design of stable and environment-friendly CGFBs.",

Acidic thiourea, however, was found to be ineffective in eluting platinum cyanide from strong base resins, but eluted palladium cyanide. The concentration of the eluting agents was found to affect the elution to a noticeable degree, with no significant effect imparted by the elution temperature and flow rate. Overall, it can be concluded that platinum cyanide and palladium cyanide can be effectively eluted from strong base anion exchange resins, with the use of potassium thiocyanate and zinc cyanide. However, split elution alternatives, such as acid washing, should be investigated to separate platinum cyanide and palladium cyanide from the base metal cyanides loaded on the resins.",

The optimisation of water addition demands understanding of capillarity properties of iron ore mixtures to ensure at the same time good mechanical strength of iron ore granules and just needed minimum of water in the granulation drum. Thus, in the current work wettability and capillarity properties of 7 iron ores, 7 additives and 7 mixtures of those components were studied. It was found that particles with size below 0.1\u00a0mm have a big influence on the contact angle and percentage of infiltrated water of mixtures. Particularly, the content of hematite Ore 1 had a significant effect on the contact angle. The use of calcine and dolomite additives affects slightly the magnitude of the water surface tension, but modifies the wettability of iron ores. The adaptation of the Cassie model for mixtures of iron ores of >\u00a02-phases gave an excellent estimation of the contact angle for mixtures with size particles below 0.1\u00a0mm. A good estimation for mixtures with particles larger than 0.1\u00a0mm was also obtained.",

     "abstract": "In this research, a zinc sulfide (sphalerite) concentrate of Angouran mine was studied by direct atmospheric leaching process. This process is an alternative to the conventional method of roast-leach-electrowinning (RLE) for zinc production by assisting ferric ions as powerful oxidant. The independent sphalerite leaching parameters investigated were ferric ions concentration (0.4\u20131.2\u00a0M), temperature (40\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C), particle size (21\u201353\u00a0\u03bcm), sulfuric acid concentration (0.5\u20131.5\u00a0M) and time (2\u20136\u00a0h). Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the process parameters. The most influencing parameter was found to be temperature and the less effective was acid concentration. Based on the results, ferric ions illustrate a complex effect on the recovery of zinc; In this regard, interaction of ferric ions with operational parameters was proposed. The optimum recovery for leaching of the zinc sulfide concentrate (e.g., 84.72%) was obtained at ferric ions concentration of 1.2 M, temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C, mean particle size of 21\u00a0\u03bcm and leaching time of 6\u00a0h. The predicted percentage recovery of zinc at the optimum condition was found to be 84.96% which was very close to the experimental value of 84.72%. Kinetic investigation was carried out in the optimum condition that obtained by RSM. Kinetic results showed that there were two stages in the sphalerite leaching. At the beginning of the leaching process, kinetics of sphalerite leaching is fast, while after about an hour the overall rate of leaching has decreased. The kinetic of leaching in the first stage is affected by both rate of chemical reaction and rate of diffusion through the sulfur layer. In this stage, the contribution of chemical reaction gradually decreases by increasing the temperature. In the second stage, the leaching rate of sphalerite is controlled only by diffusion through the product layer.",

Consequently, this may lead to an improved understanding of organo-clay complexes for remediation purposes of polluted areas. The interactions between sepiolite and sepiolite-bound humic acid (HA), and its influence on the mechanism of the formation of sepiolite-humic acid complexes were examined by characterizing the structure of sepiolite through UV/Vis spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM\u00a0+\u00a0FEG), specific surface area, pore size and volume, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The UV\u2013vis spectral results of the raw sepiolite showed that there is no correlation between UV254 and the amount of humic substance released from sepiolite is dependent on increasing extraction time. The low values of humification index of the sepiolite confirmed the presence of HA with higher, and similar molecular weight, particle size, humification degree and aromaticity. Hence, it can be concluded that HA groups are presumably associated with the large quantity of silanol groups located on the sepiolite external surface preferentially through H-bonds and/or surface complexation interactions between the functional groups in HA and dissolved metal cations (Mn\u00a0+). This finding is in good agreement with results from FTIR and SEM-FEG investigations. EDAX analysis of the HA-extracted sepiolite illustrated a strong decrease in Mg2\u00a0+, Ca2\u00a0+ and K+ content indicating that electrically charged sites on HA may form metal complexes of high stability through chelation.",

Results showed that Fe3\u00a0+ remarkably promoted chalcopyrite dissolution at the initial stage of leaching process, while easily caused the final passivation at the later stage. Leaching experiments showed that Fe2\u00a0+ cannot promote chalcopyrite dissolution in N2 atmosphere, while significantly promoted chalcopyrite dissolution in O2 atmosphere. XPS and electrochemistry further proved that Fe2\u00a0+ cannot directly react with chalcopyrite, Fe2\u00a0+ was steadily oxidized to Fe3\u00a0+ by O2 and caused redox potential at an appropriate range (about 380\u2013480\u00a0mV vs. Ag/AgCl), thus eliminating passivation species of polysulfide (Sn2\u00a0\u2212) and promoting chalcopyrite dissolution. Dissolved oxygen can directly oxidize chalcopyrite when with no addition of metal ions. In addition, Fe3\u00a0+, rather than O2 was the main oxidant in leaching system of chalcopyrite at normal atmospheric pressure. Band theory was used to further interpret the roles of oxidants and reductants in bioleaching system of chalcopyrite. This work is potentially useful in interpreting the roles of oxidants and reductants in bioleaching system of chalcopyrite at normal atmospheric pressure and 45\u00a0\u00b0C.",

The latter is subsequently filtered and concentrated by evaporation process resulting in fluorine or acid gas. In this paper, we present a new procedure of phosphoric acid production by using recycled hexafluosilicic acid instead of sulfuric acid.Fluorine recycling process involves several steps starting with the bubbling of the resulting acid gas through hexafluosilicic acid solutions followed by a pre-concentration step before attacking the natural phosphate rock. The advantages of such procedure lies in decreasing the sulfuric acid quantities needed for the phosphoric acid production as well as in the environmental benefits from the recycling process of the harmful fluorine gas.In this work, phosphate rock was attacked by a mixture of hexafluosilicic acid (20% by weight) and recycled phosphoric acid (25% in P2O5). The cake obtained by vacuum filtration of the slurry was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The main peaks obtained by XRD were attributed to chukrovite (Ca4AlSiSO4F13\u00b712H2O), gypsum, and silica quartz. However, the calcium content in the produced phosphoric acid has to be maintained lower than 3.5% in order to avoid the formation of cloudy phosphoric solutions by the formation of CaF2 which affects the filtration of the mixture.",

The effect of Bay\u00f3var RP particle size on phosphate solubilization was analyzed for cultivations under submerged (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF). The RP particle size played a key role in phosphate solubilization, with gains of up to 60% for SmF and 115% for SSF. The mechanical treatment of RP, combined with the biological cultivation process, resulted in an optimized solubilization of P, and it was shown that even short periods of milling could be highly effective. This proposed strategy could contribute to advances in the current bio-based economy and assist future developments in large-scale industrial production of biofertilizers.",

Residual water was evaporated to recover the CaCl2, and the resulting kaolin from pulp was oven-dried and turned into metakaolin. The analysis performed for the characterization of the materials were: X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) before and after treatment of the material; X-ray Diffraction (XRD); Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA).

     "abstract": "Coal desulfurization prior to combustion, coking or gasification is beneficial for both the upgrading of quality of commercial coal and the protection of the environment. The sulfur in coking coals usually makes coke unqualified while that in power coals creates several environmental problems, such as acid rain and air pollution. The sulfur forms in coal are primarily divided into two types, i.e. inorganic sulfur and organic sulfur. In most cases, inorganic sulfur is relatively easier to remove than organic sulfur by gravity separation after liberation pretreatments. The primary desulfurization methods include physical, physico-chemical, chemical, and microbial desulfurization. Among the above-mentioned desulfurization methods, chemical-related desulfurization is considered to be the most effective methods for both inorganic and organic sulfur, which is essential to be reviewed. This review highlights the developments in coal chemical-related desulfurization, including acid/alkaline leaching, H2O2 oxidation, electrochemical reduction, solvent extraction, pyrolysis, air oxidation, microwave/ultrasonic assisted desulfurization in the past decade. The effective and future desulfurization technologies are recommended throughout this review.",

Adsorption and FTIR spectra measurements illustrate that OGM could absorb more strongly on pyrophyllite surface than on pyrite surface, and the interaction of OGM with the pyrophyllite surface consists of a dominant chemisorptions while the OGM cannot interfere with the FTIR spectrum of pyrite.

The process simulation was carried out by Aspen Plus with inputs from thermodynamic simulation of selective sub-processes using Factsage software. The exergy analysis includes the overall processing circuit as well as individual sub-processes. Furthermore, the exergy efficiency for the Ferronickel processing route was determined for the case of having a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and one without. The combination of performing overall process simulations, thermodynamic simulation of sub-processes and performing an exergy analysis is a new way to integrate these three approaches and knowledge that will benefit especially those working in mineral processing. It was found that the HPAL unit processes are relatively high in efficiency except for ammonium sulphate recovery (58.1% and 71.4%) due to heat required to concentrate and recrystallize the compound. The efficiencies of the Ferronickel unit processes are affected by the operating temperature. HRSGs are added to the downstream unit processes to recover waste heat generated from the flare and slag/matte cooling, giving a higher exergy efficiency of 91.2% and 94% respectively.",

These are the most popularly adopted units for separation of mineral sands, but its application for processing of other minerals is scanty. In the present investigation, an effort has been made to understand the role of different process variables of RERMS and IRMS to separate the hematite fines from a low-grade ore. Before magnetic separation studies, detailed characterisation of the material was carried out regarding physical, chemical, mineralogical and magnetic properties which are discussed critically from the magnetic separation point of view. Based on the findings of the characterisation, magnetic separation was conducted using RERMS and IRMS by varying some of the relevant process variables. Further, the effects of each variable on hematite segregation in these units were discussed, and optimum process conditions were derived for the efficient recovery of hematite fines from the low-grade ore. The separation efficiency of these separators is compared with liberation data obtained from QEMSCAN. Finally, the paper concludes stating that RERMS and IRMS can be utilized as a pre-concentrator/scavenger unit to discard a maximum amount of gangue in a single stage of dry operation which will save energy regarding the fine grinding of the ore for liberation.",

     "abstract": "Physicochemical changes in a siliceous bauxite ore during attrition milling, and corresponding changes in reactivity are described in this paper. Atrition milling of bauxite has been found to have high milling efficiency. BET Specific surface area has sharply increased in the initial stages, but flattened eventually. Decrease in the enthalpy and temperature of transformation (gibbsite to boehmite) with increase in milling time is a consequence of mechanically induced reactivity. The surface charge, as measured by zeta potential, altered as the milling time is increased; such changes in the surface, surface activation, are also a manifestation of reactivity enhancement with milling. The increase in surface reactivity has been explained in terms of generation of more proton active species (\u2261\u00a0AlOH) at the surface. Analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns of bauxite milled for different duration shows progressive breakdown of gibbsite structure to an amorphous state \u2013 high energy state - with milling. Reactivity enhancement ensuing attrition milling leads to near complete digestion of bauxite (alumina) in Bayer (caustic soda) solution even at ambient pressure. Alumina recovery correlates well with specific surface area and degree of amorphisation; however, amorphisation (mechanical activation) is more relevant than specific surface area for multiphase systems like that of bauxite used in this study.",

Its ability to adhere to sulfide ores when grown in sulfide mineral substrates is very important for the entire biooxidation process. However, few studies have investigated the ore adhesion properties of L. ferriphilum. In this paper, the effects of temperature, pH and the passive layer of the sulfide ore surface on the ore adherence properties and biooxidation capacities of L. ferriphilum LJ02, which was screened by our laboratory, were investigated. The results of these experiments showed that both the contact and non-contact leaching mechanism were evident during the sulfide biooxidation process. L. ferriphilum LJ02 preferred the contact leaching mechanism to the non-contact leaching mechanism. Within the experimental range of temperatures from 36\u00a0\u00b0C to 46\u00a0\u00b0C, the OAR (ore adhesion ratio) of L. ferriphilum LJ02 increased initially and then decreased with the temperature. The optimum OAR was 0.84 at 41\u00a0\u00b0C. Within the experimental pH range of 1.1 to 2.0, the OAR of L. ferriphilum LJ02 decreased with pH. The optimum OAR was 0.87 at pH\u00a01.1. It was also found that the OAR of L. ferriphilum LJ02 could be reduced by the passive layer on the surface of the sulfide ore, which was generated during the biooxidation process. Moreover, it seems that the OAR of L. ferriphilum LJ02 was proportional to the sulfide biooxidation efficiency.",

     "abstract": "The determination of hardness and approximate mineral composition of rocks and classifying these lithologies aids in controlling various processes in the plant, such as reducing the grinding process, which accounts for about 50% of its energy consumption. In this paper, a new method for rock lithological classification is presented, based on color as well as 3D laser based features. The method uses color and laser range images, acquired from rocks on a conveyor belt, to compute Gabor and LBP (Local Binary Pattern) features. Various Gabor and LBP features are tested, including rotation invariant features. The images are tessellated into sub-images in which the features are computed. The classification is performed in two stages. In the first stage, the sub-images are classified by using a support-vector machine (SVM) classifier. In the second stage, the classification is improved by a voting process among all the sub-images of each rock. The method was tested on a database with five different rock lithologies taken from a copper mine which has been used in previous studies, allowing comparison with our new results. The results show that the classification performance was improved significantly by adding the 3D laser texture features, and using a combination of rotation invariant Gabor and LBP features, achieving a classification accuracy of 99.24% on the database. Using the CMIM (Conditional Mutual Information Maximization) feature selection method showed that only 10% of the total extracted features are required to achieve the maximum correct classification rate and that using the 3D laser features, (for the first time in our rock classification method to the best of our knowledge) is important for maintaining high classification performance.",

Uranium leaching curves obtained over a range of time, temperature, [H2SO4], [FeTOT] and redox potential conditions were similar with each having three discrete segments representing significantly different rates of uranium leaching. The first segment occurred in the initial min and involved extremely rapid leaching. This segment made up for the majority of the overall uranium leaching obtained over the test period (~\u00a02.10% U). The high rate of leaching in this segment was demonstrated to be attributed to liberation of surface oxidized uranium from the betafite structure. The second segment between 1 and 120\u00a0min was characterised by slow uranium leach rates which could be partially influenced by altering the experimental conditions. Uranium leaching within this period was most likely due to oxidation of uranium by ferric iron which was progressively slowed by the competing diffusion reaction. The uranium leach rate in the third segment was negligible. This negligible leach rate was demonstrated to occur when approximately 2.10% U had leached from the sample and was shown to be due to passivation of the sample surface. Investigations into leaching betafite using various iron salts showed the uranium leaching more than doubling when iron fluoride was substituted for iron sulfate. The additional solubility was attributed to leaching of Nb, Ti, and Ta due to the in-situ formation of HF, where the HF either slowed the formation of a passivating layer or the HF was able to slowly dissolve the passivating layer.",

Yield stress measurement with the vane method, uniaxial compressive testing and microstructure analysis have been conducted on various CPB samples with different sodium chloride (salt; NaCl) concentrations and cured in a sub-zero temperature for different times (0, 0.25, 1, 2 and 4\u00a0h for yield stress measurement; 7, 28 and 90\u00a0days for compressive strength testing). The results show that the yield stress decreases with an increase in salinity. The strength of CPB under freezing conditions decreases as the concentration of NaCl is increased. A shift from the strain-softening behaviour of CPB that has no salinity to the strain-hardening behaviour of CPB with high salinity is observed. Additionally, it is also noticed that with curing time, the deformation behaviour of the studied CPB becomes gradually less ductile. The microstructural analysis results show that the binder hydration products are affected by the salinity. There is strong indication that the absorption of the Na\u00a0+ ions by calcium\u2013silicate\u2013hydrate leads to the decrease of the strength of CPB with different saline concentrations. The results of this investigation provide technical information for the designing of cost-effective, safe and durable CPB structures in sub-zero mining environments.",

On the other hand, the natural occurrence of potassium-rich silicate minerals in these countries, has seldom been commercially exploited until recently. Technological strategies that can increase the reactivity of these minerals can turn them into a resource for K fertilizer production. This work aimed to investigate the changes in solubility of Verdete rock (VR) after calcination with a melting agent (MA- CaCl2\u00b72H2O) under varying temperatures of calcination and ratios (w\u00a0w\u2212\u00a01) of MA/VR. Measurements of extractable K in water (Kwater), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) were performed to identify new mineral phases. The Kwater increased up to 184-fold when the VR was calcined in the presence of MA. Optimization of calcination of VR to temperature of 850\u00a0\u00b0C and a 1.7 ratio (w\u00a0w\u2212\u00a01) of MA/VR yielded Kwater values of up to 95% of total K. Potassium K-edge XANES analysis revealed changes in the molecular environment of K due to the calcination of VR at increasing temperatures. The K K-edge XANES fit to sylvite was supported by the detection of this mineral by XRD analysis at calcination temperatures ranging from 700 to 900\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, K K-edge XANES analysis indicated the gradual formation of a new potassium-silicate mineral with increasing temperature, which the XANES analysis showed to be an amorphous-K2SiO3 (Amorphous-K2SiO3). The combination of Kwater and the residue of Linear Combination Fitting analysis (LCF) performed on the XANES data suggested the formation of an undefined K mineral phase additional to sylvite and Amorphous-K2SiO3. The calcination process was effective in producing highly soluble K mineral phases from a low solubility raw material. The end-products of the calcination procedure obtained in our work represent a promising alternative material for K fertilizer production, but further evaluation of the plant availability of the K in soils is needed.",

     "abstract": "To understand the effect of aqueous impurities on chalcopyrite dissolution during acid metalliferous drainage and hydrometallurgical processes, batch dissolution experiments were carried out at 650 and 750\u00a0mV (SHE), pH\u00a01 and 35\u201375\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence or absence of aqueous cationic additives. Activation energies (Ea) for chalcopyrite dissolution in the presence of additives at 750\u00a0mV, derived using a modified \u2018time to a given fraction\u2019 method, demonstrate that Ea varies with reaction extent. The overall trend of evolution from interface- to transport-controlled mechanism was independent of additive type or addition. This suggests that it is not primarily variation in the enthalpy of dissolution that controls the significant changes in relative dissolution rates on addition of additives.Rather, the relative dissolution rates on addition of aqueous cations are found to relate to the M\u2013O framework volume (M and O being the cationic additive and oxygen within H2O in the first sphere of hydration, respectively). There is good inverse linear correlation between this volume and the relative dissolution rate per unit ionic strength which varies as K+\u00a0>\u00a0Al3+\u00a0>\u00a0no additive\u00a0>\u00a0Mg2+\u00a0>\u00a0Na+\u00a0>\u00a0Ca2+. It is proposed that this effect is related to the relative strength of hydration of the additives with the commensurate entropic effect on solute hydration being advantageous for chalcopyrite dissolution on K+ and Al3+ addition and detrimental for the other additives. H4SiO4, the dominant aqueous species upon Si addition under the conditions examined, has low affinity for water, resulting in a detrimental entropic contribution to solute hydration and dissolution. The effect of Fe addition on relative dissolution rate is convoluted by the role of Fe3+ as the primary oxidant for chalcopyrite dissolution. On addition of aqueous Fe to dissolution at 750\u00a0mV, the effect is detrimental due to the detrimental effect on the entropy of hydration of the solute and the relative abundance of Fe3+. At 650\u00a0mV the effect of the greater presence of Fe3+ due to Fe addition dominates and the dissolution rate is enhanced.",

However, in contrast to high-grade nickel sulphide ore, low-grade nickel laterite ore cannot be as easily upgraded by current technologies due to its complicated mineral structure and nickel distribution. This study investigated the mineralogical characteristics, occurrence state and dissemination characteristics of nickel within Yunnan nickel laterite ore in China. Nickel laterite ore had a complex internal structure and mainly consisted of limonite (10\u00a0wt.%) and serpentine (87\u00a0wt.%). Sulphides were not a significant part of this laterite ore and were rarely observed. Furthermore, the nickel was mainly hosted in serpentine by substitution for Mg or by adsorption. Serpentine had a mean grade of approximately 0.77\u00a0wt.% Ni and represented approximately 81.49\u00a0wt.% of the total laterite resource. A portion of the laterite ore had a pore structure that was formed by destruction of the original protolith during and after its formation, with a specific surface area of 70.042\u00a0m2/g. The actual temperature for the reduction of metal oxides within the ore was analysed by H2-TPR (temperature-programmed reduction), which indicated that it was higher than the reduction temperature of the pure metal oxides. Finally, based on the above analyses, a non-melting reduction treatment process was proposed for efficient and reasonable utilization of Yunnan laterite ore.",

This paper presents calculations of the hydrodynamics of the continuous phase only in the FCSMC columns, obtained using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) with a single-phase model. The flow characteristics in the open and packed FCSMC columns are compared and interpreted in relation to the enhancement in the flotation recovery. In the open column, a mono-turbulent circulating flow pattern formed in the whole column. In comparison to the flow field in the open FCSMC, the flow pattern in the FCSMC packed with the fluid guiding media changed from a strong cyclonic flow to a mild upward flow in the column separation part so as to avoid particle-bubble detachment. The packed media is capable of maintaining a strong cyclonic flow in the cyclone separation part so that the particles collide with, and attach to, the bubbles, while stabilizing the liquid flow in the column separation part so that the attached particles stay attached to the bubbles. The influence of the rotating flow on the particle-bubble detachment was quantified by considering a particle-bubble couplet in the flotation column. The probability of particle detachment is substantially decreased in the packed column as the rotating velocity is dramatically decreased due to the hindrance effect of the packed media. The Bond number of the couplet in the open and packed columns is 0.59 and 0.15 individually, corresponding to the probability of particle detachment 51% in the open column and 0.34% in the packed column. In particular, we have connected the hydrodynamics to particle-bubble detachment in order to understand the mechanism for the improvement of the flotation recovery in the packed FCSMC flotation column. Computer simulation and modeling is proved to be a powerful tool in mineral processing research where experimental techniques are restricted due to the limitations of experimental conditions.",

The processes used for slag manipulation were elucidated and optimized for silicon extraction.

A decisive factor for the extraction of SiO2 during hydrothermal treatment was the concentration of NaOH. Its increase from 60 to 140\u00a0g/l reduced the amount of residual SiO2 more than half and significantly decreased the formation of analcime (NaAlSi2O6\u00b7H2O) in the solid phase.

This treatment is an eco-efficient process because it employs low temperatures to activate the BA and implies no emission of CO2 to the atmosphere. Through this HT process, the synthesis of tobermorite is optimized considering the results from different characterization techniques. In addition, the dissolution of chlorides through HT is observed, improving the reutilization of BA in cement-based materials.

To enhance the rate of mineral carbonation at any specific mine site, it is important to develop individualized methods for use at that specific mine site, and with respect to its particular waste mineralogy. This study examines mechanical activation as the pre-treatment method for ultramafic mine waste containing forsterite and serpentine. Particle size distribution, specific surface area, microstructure and direct aqueous mineral carbonation were measured to test the effects of mechanical activation. The Rietveld method was used to analyze the microstructure of untreated and mechanically-activated material. It was found that, as a result of the grinding energy input on olivine, particle size was decreased, surface area was increased, crystallite size was reduced and micro-strain was accumulated. During the dry mechanical activation of mine waste, serpentine content was partially dehydrated and converted to olivine. The concurrent grinding of serpentine with olivine promoted the formation of new surface area, but it hindered the disordering of the crystal structure of forsterite. Forsterite makes up the majority of the content and contributes to CO2 sequestration under selected carbonation conditions. The CO2 sequestration conversion of mechanically-activated olivine and mine waste are 22.5% and 31.5%, respectively, with 3600\u00a0kWh/t specific milling energy input after one hour direct aqueous carbonation. For the purposes of mineral carbonation, the mechanical activation of mine waste is preferable to simply grinding pure olivine.",

The initial part of this study involved the development of a selective dissolution protocol to quantify the differential dissolution extents of the two Ni-bearing minerals. Application of this protocol to the pyrrhotite tailings sample showed that an acidity of 15\u00a0wt% HCl, and a temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C was adequate to selectively dissolve 96% of pyrrhotite from the tailings. Subsequently, an anoxic acidic leach of the tailings at pH\u00a01.5, and at 5% (w/v) solids loading showed minimal dissolution of Fe and Ni from pentlandite in tests with and without pH control. The extent of Ni dissolution was next evaluated as a function of pH during an oxic acid leach. The testing protocol involved leaching the tailings under two pH regimes: fixed and uncontrolled pH. The results showed that operation at a fixed pH increases the extent of Ni dissolution due to the higher concentration of the oxidant Fe(III) in solution. Finally, an oxic ferric leach showed that the terminal dissolution extents of pyrrhotite and pentlandite were comparable at 46% total Ni extraction.",

     "abstract": "In coal preparation, clean coal ash content is a key indicator for evaluating the quality of clean coal. Online ash analysers are employed to rapidly measure the clean ash, and the resulting measurements are monitored for productive process control. However, the ash observations often fluctuate and are disorganized due to random errors and analyser measurement errors, local variations in coal flow, and changing equipment and processes. Thus, this paper attempts to use the Shewhart control chart method to monitor clean ash in a statistical and global manner. From investigations of the coal preparation process, three types of variability can occur in ash process data: random variability, special variability and systemic variability. An effective X \u2212 -Shewhart control chart can detect all abnormal variations under the condition that the control chart parameters (subgroup and control limits) are properly determined. To achieve this, an error analysis of an ash analyser and the influence of data autocorrelation were considered before structuring a clean ash control chart. In phase I, a preliminary dataset was collected from actual ash observations. After an autocorrelation analysis, which excluded abnormal variations, a sampling scheme comparison and the selection of a population standard deviation for the preliminary data, the control chart parameters were precisely estimated. In phase II, the phase I analysis procedure was broadly used to structure a X \u2212 chart with given standard values for monitoring clean ash. Therefore, an application example is presented, and the results are discussed to demonstrate the positive impact of this method on a coal preparation plant.",

Monazite, a phosphate mineral containing mainly light REEs, is one of the principal minerals found in South Australian REE-bearing deposits. Froth flotation, which exploits the differences in the physicochemical properties of minerals, has proven to be effective in the beneficiation of REE minerals. The physicochemical properties of monazite, hematite, and quartz including zeta potential, contact angle, and floatability were determined in this investigation. Sodium oleate, sodium dodecyl sulphate, and hydroxamic acid were employed as collectors. Electroacoustic zeta potential measurements were used to identify the interaction between monazite, hematite, and quartz and the selected collectors. The capillary rise method was used to determine the contact angle of the three minerals. Single mineral flotation using Denver microflotation cell was carried out to confirm physicochemical properties measured. It is shown that the contact angle of the minerals is dependent on the collector type used. The isoelectric point (IEP) of monazite, hematite, and quartz occurred at pH of 6.5, 6.9, and 2.2, respectively. The zeta potential results also suggest that the collectors chemisorb onto monazite and hematite surfaces with a corresponding change in IEP values. Single mineral flotation results demonstrated that monazite and hematite could be floated by the selected collectors; however, low or no quartz flotation was observed in some cases. Results from electrokinetic and contact angle measurements are consistent with that of the floatability of monazite, hematite, and quartz.",

     "abstract": "Frothers, which are widely used as key reagents in the flotation of ores, are generally alcohols of varying structures. There is abundant experimental data which illustrates that frothers cause changes in froth behavior, bubble size/coalescence and surface tension and that these changes are closely associated with changes in the molecular structure of the frothers. Partial molar Excess Gibbs energy is a thermodynamic property which quantifies the difference between the partial molar value of the Gibbs energy of a species in a real mixture and that for the same species in an ideal mixture and this difference in mixture properties is due to differences in the molecular structures of the constituent species. It is thus reasonable to hypothesize that partial molar Excess Gibbs energy may be a useful parameter to quantify the changes which occur when using frothers of different molecular structures. In this paper it is shown that there is a generally strong relationship between measured characteristics such as froth volume/height, surface tension, hemi-micelle formation and the partial molar Excess Gibbs energy of alcohol frothers and these correlations provide robust evidence that many of the characteristics of frothers are strongly related to their molecular structure which in turn is related to the total surface area, molecular volume, and molar volume of the molecule, the molecular weight of the constituent functional groups and the interaction energies between the species present.",

The results of electrical fragmentation tests on concrete show that i) fragmentation level and selectivity are significantly enhanced when the size of the constituent aggregate in the concrete increases, which is a positive result because the largest proportion of most concrete mixes comprises coarse aggregate (45% of 5/20\u00a0mm aggregate); ii) the mineralogical nature of the aggregate has little impact on the electrical fragmentation level and has none on its selectivity, which are positive results demonstrating the robustness of the process in terms of its ability to process aggregate of different origins and iii) aggregate liberation degree depends on neither the energy level applied to the concrete, nor the quality of the process water, which are positive results for industrial applications.

Although it is usually considered as an industry standard, its procedure was not fully defined by Fred Bond, and sometimes sensible variations in test results can be obtained due to some undefined steps in the method. This is the case of the calculation of characteristic size in product (P80), which must be calculated through interpolation using some PSD (particle size distribution) function and Bond's procedure did not establish the way to perform this calculation. The purpose of this technical note is to outline an evaluation of the adjustment quality of different distribution models in order to determine P80 in Bond's ball mill test.",

The rubidium ions which existed in the alumina octahedron of the phyllosilicates structure could be extracted effectively by using CaCl2 as chlorinating reagent due to formation of Ca(Al2Si2O8) phase in the chlorination process of kaolin ore, and the maximum extraction yield reached 96.95%.

     "abstract": "Ground ultrafine and nano- materials are mainly produced by wet stirred media milling. The product related stress model can be used for the optimization of such grinding processes; the operational parameters can be related to the particle size or specific surface of the product. At the same time, for many materials dry grinding is required. During dry stirred media milling different problems arise, such as aggregation, agglomeration and particles sticking on the mill liners and on the grinding media. Consequently, the processes taking place in the mill and the effects of the operational parameters on the product properties are not as thoroughly known as in the case of wet stirred milling. In the present paper the application of the product related stress model for product dispersity control in dry batch stirred media milling is presented. Modifications of the models' main parameters such as stress intensity and stress number are introduced. The applications of the modified main parameters are presented for the optimization of the material and grinding media filling ratio, as well as functions for the characterization of the effect of the stress number and stress intensity on the product. With the introduced modifications, the product related stress model proved to be suitable for the characterization of dry batch stirred media milling.",

The review also covers a coke strength index, the JKCSI, which unifies various rotating drum indices in different world standards into one single index, and a procedure to predict coal grindability, the HGI. In the application for energy assessment, the JK size-dependent breakage model is used to smooth the energy-size reduction relationship and predict crusher energy requirement, to explain the non-linear response of power station grinding mill capacity with the coal grindability index HGI, to develop a benchmark energy factor to assess energy efficiency for comminution equipment and circuits, and to estimate specific energy reduction resulting from the high voltage pulse pre-weakening effect.

     "abstract": "High carbon ferrochrome slag is a byproduct of High Carbon Ferrochrome (HCFeCr) production in submerged arc furnaces. The slag is conventionally tapped from the furnaces and granulated before being dumped as waste. The major uses of the slag have been in road and civil engineering construction and in production of refractories. HCFeCr slags however, contain appreciable amounts of residual ferrochrome alloy which can be liberated and recovered profitably using cheap and environmentally friendly gravity concentration methods. In this work the milling behavior of a high-carbon ferrochrome slag is investigated. Milling experiments for a typical HCFeCr slag were conducted using a 0.303 by 0.282\u00a0m laboratory ball mill to establish liberation as a function of particle size and to determine the associated key breakage parameters like the breakage function (Bij) and selection function (Si). The breakage parameters were obtained using the monosize fraction method by milling the following size fractions \u2212\u00a013.2\u00a0+\u00a09.5\u00a0mm, \u2212\u00a09.5\u00a0+\u00a05.6\u00a0mm, \u2212\u00a05.6\u00a0+\u00a04\u00a0mm, \u2212\u00a04\u00a0+\u00a02.8\u00a0mm, \u2212\u00a02.8\u00a0+\u00a01.18\u00a0mm and \u2212\u00a01.18\u00a0+\u00a00.15\u00a0mm. The effects of powder filling and mill speed were also tested experimentally. An increase in the milling speed from 75% Ncrit to 85% Ncrit caused an increase in the selection functions of different fractions however a further increase to 90% Ncrit resulted in a drastic reduction in the rate of milling across all size fractions. Increasing the powder filling from 40% to 60% caused a marked increase in the selection functions for the particles in the size fraction \u2212\u00a05.6\u00a0+\u00a04\u00a0mm and smaller and a decrease in the selection functions for the particles in the size fraction \u2212\u00a09.5\u00a0+\u00a05.6\u00a0mm and larger. A further increase in the powder filling to 80% caused a marked fall in the selection functions for all size fractions to values lower than those obtained at 40% powder filling. The results from the size by assay test-work showed that the sizes of particles that contain the highest amount of the ferrochrome alloy and the least amount of silica are in the range \u2212\u00a01.18\u00a0+\u00a00.6\u00a0mm. The milling process has to maximize the generation of particles in this specific size range in order to achieve the best alloy recoveries in the downstream concentration unit.",

This series of papers present 20 applications of the model for the mineral and coal industries. Part 3 of this series reviews its application to modelling comminution equipment. It is demonstrated that the JK size-dependent breakage model not only can be used for modelling particle breakage, but also can be employed as a basic structure for modelling comminution equipment. This is different to the traditional equipment modelling approaches, in which the population balance models are dominant. In this energy-size reduction modelling approach, the JK size-dependent breakage model provides a key mathematical template to rationally link the size reduction as the equipment model output with ore breakage property and specific energy as the two model inputs. Five case studies are reviewed, which includes modelling of a hammer mill for coke feed preparation, a vertical spindle mill for coal pulverised fuel grinding, a ball mill for batch grinding and continuous operation, HPGR simulations based on piston press testing data, and high voltage pulse disintegration of ores. A common feature of these models is that they all incorporate the measured material breakage characteristic parameters and machine operational conditions that are represented by the size-specific energy relation. The energy-size reduction modelling approach permits the simulations of the effects of changes in ore/coal and machine operating conditions on comminution product size distribution.",

Through a series of micro-flotation tests, batch flotation tests, adsorption experiments and zeta potential measurements, the selective depression performance and depression mechanism of the AWG were demonstrated. The micro-flotation results indicate that the AWG at a molar ratio 1:3 of oxalic acid to water glass (WG) exhibits the maximum selective depression on olivine. The selective flotation of ilmenite from olivine can be better achieved using an AWG as depressant rather than WG in the artificially mixed minerals flotation experiments. Batch flotation test results indicate that, compared with the depressant WG, the depressant AWG not only increases the recovery and grade of the Ti concentrates by 7.74% and 3.82%, respectively, but also decreases the depressant consumption by two-fifths. Adsorption tests and zeta-potential measurements indicate that the AWG exhibits a stronger adsorption on the surface of olivine than ilmenite. The adsorption of the AWG on the olivine surface prevents the mineral from adsorbing collector NaOL due to electrostatic repulsion.",

The results showed a decrease in the generation of H2O2 with the addition of depressants during grinding while the addition of depressant and collector together increased H2O2 formation in the flotation pulp liquid. The flotation results showed that pyrite is effectively depressed when the depressant and collector are added together during grinding, corresponding to a condition of higher amounts of H2O2 in the pulp liquid thereby causing the oxidation of pyrite surface and depression in flotation. The best results of metal sulphides grade and recovery achieved also correspond to the same flotation conditions.",

     "abstract": "Although several hydrometallurgical treatment options for dirty copper sulfide concentrates have been developed in recent years, these processes have not been implemented by industry. Attention has therefore shifted to pyroprocessing such concentrates in order to provide clean feed for the well-established sulfide smelting process. In this paper, recent publications on pyrometallurgical processing of enargite and gold concentrates have been reviewed, which indicate that little has been added to already existing knowledge of the thermal behavior of enargite. The arsenic fix-roast approach using Na2CO3 and Ca(OH)2 to capture the arsenic during roasting does not seem to be a practical approach due to insufficient capture and also the complexity of the subsequent phase separations. A more pragmatic approach would be further development of neutral/reductive roast of enargite concentrates in order to produce clean feed for the existing smelters and to convert arsenic into its sulfides which are more stable and compact than its oxides. Potentially high temperatures (>\u00a0650\u00a0\u00b0C) required for effective arsenic removal from enargite concentrates has represented a significant barrier for the development of roasting equipment. This calls for further development of pyroprocessing strategies through a better understanding of the thermodynamics of the Cu-As-S-(O) system. The results of recent research indicate that the mysterious role of pyrite, always present in enargite concentrates in thermal transformation of enargite, has been largely underestimated and not well understood. This necessitates a thorough understanding of the even more complicated Cu-Fe-As-S-(O) system.",

However, little is known about the potential impact of these organic molecules released from disrupted bacteria cells on flotation performance. In this study, using the same representative system as previously used with intact cells, we investigated the effect of disrupted cells on flotation. This representative system consists of E. coli cells disrupted by sonication (also called lysed cells) as the model bacterium and three copper-containing mineral systems of increasing complexity as the ore model. It was found that the disrupted cells had a negative effect on copper flotation, which tended to weaken as ore composition became more complex. The negative effect of the disrupted cells on copper flotation was more pronounced than that of the intact cells. Flotation of gold and pyrite was found to be depressed as well possibly due to the preferential adhesion of the lysed cells on pyrite. Findings in this study enhance understanding and management of the risk posed by bacteria-laden water which is being increasingly used as an alternative water source for mineral processing.",

The power consumed in this stage is higher when compared to other stages, owing to increased size reduction ratio. The primary purpose of grinding is to reduce the particle size to optimum so that mineral particles can be extracted more economically. Decision making plays an important role here, as it involves determining and comparing the energy that is required to perform the grinding process and also determining the amount of minerals lost as the coarser size particles are arrived at in mineral beneficiation. In general, Bond's work index is used to determine the grinding efficiency and also to calculate the power requirement. The process is very time consuming and it requires skilled labor and specialized mill. A systematic investigation was carried out to predict Bond's work index using simple field measurable properties of rocks. Tests were conducted on Basalt, Slate and Granite using a laboratory scale ball mill and rock properties namely density, Protodyakonov's strength index and rebound hardness number were determined.

To simulate the chemical species presence in the pulp water and their effects on the flotation of malachite and heterogenite, calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate ions were added to the feed water and the recoveries of copper and cobalt followed during the roughing flotation stage. The concentrate XRD and SEM analyses together with the floated minerals microanalyses by EDX spectroscopy, leaching tests of mono-minerals followed by the Pourbaix diagrams construction and DRIFT spectroscopic analyses, have enabled identifying changes in the surface properties of malachite and heterogenite and describing their behaviors. It was concluded that the locked-cycle recycling of process water is inducing the build-up of chemical species in the pulp, which favors the exaggerated dissolution and hydration of malachite and heterogenite interfering on the recovery of copper (40%) and cobalt (58%) with a significant drop in their concentrate grades (7.3% Cu and 2.7% Co). The deterioration of the concentrate characteristics results also from the gangue minerals entrainment.

For the studied flotation system, experimental results are compared with literature correlations and models to reveal that hydrophobic particles affect the gas hold-up through three different mechanisms modifying the Sauter mean diameter and rise velocity, namely (1) surface interactions, and the joint antagonistic effect of (2) bubble loading and (3) coalescence.",

     "abstract": "In this work, a composite central design with five levels and four variables was employed to model and optimize the batch flotation kinetic process in a cyclonic microbubble flotation column (FCMC). 30 sets of batch flotation rate tests were executed at different conditions of pulp concentration (X1), frother dosage (X2), flow rate of circulation pulp (X3) and froth depth (X4). It was observed the maximum flotation time (tmax) obtained in tests fluctuated wildly under different conditions. Statistical analysis based on the model fit and stability was performed to discriminate six kinetic models. The response surface methodology was used for the identification and development of significant relationship between process variables. Statistical analysis indicated that the modified Kelsall model was the optimal kinetic model for characterizing the flotation process. Analysis of variance results revealed that the effect of X1 was significant for all process responses. X4 was found as a significant independent factor for the two response variables of tmax and the ultimate combustible recovery (\u03b5\u221e) of the optimal kinetic model. X3 had a significant influence on the parameter of the optimal kinetic model (the fraction of flotation components with the slow rate constant). Furthermore, the maximum flotation time and \u03b5\u221e were significantly influenced by the interaction between X1 and X4. Based on the result of optimization it was found that the desired ultimate combustible recovery with an appropriate flotation time was obtained from the flotation process with a given range of experimental variables (X1: from the intermediate levels to the higher levels; X2: the intermediate level; X3: 220\u00a0g/t and X4: 25.00\u00a0mm). There was an acceptable relationship between predicted and actual values with one of the optimal conditions (Adj. R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9971). The response surface methodology was effective for predicting and optimizing the batch flotation process of FCMC.",

     "abstract": "With the increase in the demand for lithium, Li-bearing minerals could be considered as alternative resources to achieve the supplying. So, efficient technological solutions for the valorization of these minerals are required. In this context, the froth flotation process of a lepidolite ore was modelled and optimized. Closely following the response surface methodology (RSM), the effects of three independent process variables (pulp pH, flotation collector dosage and flotation time) upon two common measures of the separation (lithium recovery and lithium content) were studied. These were modelled using the experimental data obtained starting with the implementation and execution of a full 23 factorial design and ending with a (face-centered) central composite design (CCD), a second order design. The coefficients of the second-order polynomial regression models were fitted by solving linear least squares problems. After statistical validation, the fitted models were used to support the identification of the significant effects of the process variables and to provide estimations of the measures of separation (responses) for combinations of the levels of the process variables over a feasible region of interest. Using directly the measured values of Li recovery and Li content, the selected experimental Pareto optimal combination of the levels of the process variables is: pulp pH\u00a0=\u00a02, dosage of collector\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0g.t\u2212\u00a01 and flotation time\u00a0=\u00a012\u00a0min producing a concentrate with Li recovery of 91.51% and a Li content of 1.96%. Using the fitted second order models for the separation criteria, a refined Pareto optimal combination was obtained as the solution of the multicriteria optimization (maximization) problem that was solved by different methods (Weighted Sum of Objectives, Goal Programming and Desirability Functions). The refined Pareto optimal combination was the same than the selected experimental Pareto optimal combination, only the collector dosage decreased to 470\u2013478\u00a0g.t\u2212\u00a01, producing a concentrate with Li recovery around 92.50% and a Li content of 2.00%.",

The probable error (E) was 0.145 with the largest degree of sulfur content segregation. Under these separation conditions, the acceleration at a clean coal segment increased by 58.06% compared with that at a gangue area; moreover, the material stratification at the clean coal segment was apparent, and the clean coal area was the main separation area. The stratification of dense material at the gangue area was poor, and the gangue area was mainly used to transport and discharge gangue.",

     "abstract": "Surface paste disposal (SPD) of waste tailings is a new disposal method, while it is not suitable for the projects in rainy regions. Traditional tailings disposal means (a setting pond or a dam) are getting obsolete gradually due to high risk and bad influence on environment. Mining project in tropical rainy areas will face great challenge in disposing waste tailings when there is no mine-out area for backfill (new mining project or surface mining). This paper discusses the application of SPD of an iron mine project in Indonesia and demonstrates its feasibility by laboratory unconfined compression strength test and rainfall erosion test. Two kinds of tailings collected from project are used in these experiments, one of them is relatively ordinary and the other is quite fine (clay-sized particles reaches 42%), which also contains many clay minerals. Binders are added to tailings slurry to form paste tailings. Results show that the paste strength increases with the clay mineral content in a certain range and then gets fluctuating under the max value. Authors conduct preliminary discussion on this phenomenon and it is worthy to be studied deeply. Direct share test and scale effect test provide evaluation of the in situ mechanical strength on which the field paste tailings samples are based. Simulation of rainfall erosion indicates that the paste tailings curing for >\u00a06\u00a0h can withstand the location extreme rainfall without obvious damage.",

In this paper, the aggregation behavior of ultra-fine scheelite particles induced by hydrodynamic cavitation was investigated. Investigation was carried out through flotation tests, zeta potential measurements, turbidity determination and microscopic imaging. The results of flotation tests confirm that hydrodynamic cavitation can enhance the ultra-fine scheelite particles aggregation and their flotation. Nanobubbles generated by cavitation make the solid particles less negatively charged, thereby reducing the repulsive force between particles. With a low sodium oleate (NaOl) concentration, particle aggregates start to form in the slurry treated by hydrodynamic cavitation, while few aggregates are generated in the slurry without cavitation treatment. As NaOl concentration increases in the slurry pre-treated by cavitation, the formation of a network structure consisting of hydrophobized mineral particles, conventional bubbles and nanobubbles enhances the flotation recovery of ultra-fine scheelite particles.",

The parameters are discussed related to the normalized grain size, which is the ratio of mineral grain size in the product to mineral grain size in the unbroken material. Finally, the amount of transgranular and intergranular fracture on surface exposure can be calculated using the phase specific surface parameters.A sedimentary rock (apatite ore), an igneous rock (nepheline-syenite) and an artificial material (copper slags) were ground to different fineness.

Despite the vast field of mechanochemistry which encompasses an increase in reactivity due to the effect of mechanical energy input, there is still no clear picture of the involved mechanisms. In ultra-fine wet grinding the situation is further complicated due to the presence of the solvent: reactions of the stressed solid with the surrounding liquid phase can occur. In this paper several aspects of mechanochemistry occurring in stirred media mills are outlined through suitable experiments. Main focus lies on the comprehensive product characterization and on the role of the liquid phase. It is shown that the liquid phase influences product properties like particle size, porosity, particle shape, structure, chemical composition and the molecular termination of the surface. An increase in the reactivity of ground solids is manifested by a significant increase in dissolution in the aqueous phase during processing in water. Altogether, the liquid dispersion medium which can act as solvent is thus introduced as a new process parameter in stirred media milling and offers new prospects for innovative product design by top-down approaches.",

     "abstract": "The HPGR is properly regarded as one of the most important recent developments in the field of size reduction. This success is mainly associated to its improved energy efficiency, grinding capacity, lower sensitivity to grindability variations and higher metal recovery in downstream processes compared with conventional grinding technologies such as ball mills and cone crushers. It comprises two counter-rotating rolls mounted on a sturdy frame, one of which is allowed to float and is positioned using hydraulic springs. Comminution in the HPGR is largely determined by the pressure exerted on the bed of particles by the hydraulic system. The paper describes how the coupling of the multi-body dynamic simulation with the discrete element method can be effectively used to describe the performance of the HPGR. The model considers important variables, including the HPGR rolls geometry and design, the hydraulic spring system start-up parameters and the material loading response, to describe key operational outputs as material throughput, operating gap and roller pressure distribution. The preliminary version of the model has been used to demonstrate qualitatively the effect of material properties on the operating gap, the pressure and the energy consumption of a laboratory-scale HPGR. Predictions using the model have been compared to those from phenomenological models, showing good agreement, but also limitations in the DEM approach with the current simple particle replacement model to predict the working gap at high initial nitrogen pressures.",

     "abstract": "The success of any scale up process is dependent on how well the small scale test work represents the conditions of the larger scale and how well the predictive model captures the key contributors to the process. The AMIRA P9 flotation model was developed by the P9 team over a number of years (Gorain, 1997; Gorain et al., 2006). It has been widely used and generated significant value for many operations by assisting the decision making process through simulations of process changes and for flotation scale up predictions. This model assumes that the parameter P (ore floatability) remains constant over a wide range of surface area flux measurements (Sb) regardless of the amount of power introduced into the flotation cell. As a focus of this research, flotation test work was conducted at different hydrodynamic conditions in 5 and 60\u00a0L cells to challenge this assumption. Increasing the power input increased the P value especially in finer particle size classes (\u2212\u00a075\u00a0\u03bcm) in both cells demonstrating that P is not a true ore property because it is influenced by the cell hydrodynamics. To improve the accuracy of the AMIRA P9 flotation model in predicting the flotation rate constant (k) and to improve the consistency of the ore property in the model, measurable and appropriate turbulence parameters were sought to be incorporated into the model. Dimensionless turbulence parameters that could be obtained directly from measurements, \u04d5 (characterizing turbulence intensity, bubble size and viscosity) and EVF (characterizing the effective volume in flotation where majority of collision and attachment occurs) were formulated and introduced to the AMIRA P9 model. The consistency of P\u2033 (the updated floatability component) as a more consistent ore property was improved which enhanced the flotation rate constant prediction for a variety of hydrodynamic conditions of the 60\u00a0L flotation cell. Further work is recommended to test the model for continuous rather than batch processing, in larger cells that are more similar to industrial cells and to further improve the accuracy and precision of predictions of the behaviour of coarse particles.",

     "abstract": "Flotation in mechanically agitated cells has been the workhorse of the mining industry, but our quantitative understanding of the effect of microturbulence generated by agitation on flotation is still very limited. This paper aims to review the literature on quantifying the microturbulence effects on bubble-particle interactions in flotation. The particular focus is on the stochastic description of bubble-particle interactions in the turbulent flow which is a random field. We briefly review the stochastic description of microturbulence and motions of particles of micrometre sizes and bubbles of millimetre sizes in the isotropic turbulence of mechanical flotation cells. The key starting point is the generic equation of motion, which can be decomposed into the mean turbulent variables and fluctuating turbulent variables. The turbulent flow of the carrying liquid is characterised using isotropic turbulence theory. The next focus is on reviewing bubble-particle turbulent collision and detachment interactions. Bubble-particle turbulent collision is poorly quantified; no quantitative models of the bubble-particle turbulent collision efficiency relevant for flotation are available. Current theories on bubble-particle turbulent detachment face some deficiencies. In assessing the microturbulence effect on bubble-particle detachment, the majority of studies only considers the particle acceleration in the centrifugal direction but ignore the transverse acceleration of particles, which is due to turbulent shear flow. Critically, contact angle required in quantifying the detachment is not constant, single-valued as considered in the theories, but can vary from receding to advancing value during the relaxation of the triple contact line on the particle surface. The latest experiments show that multiple-valued contact angle can significantly affect stability and detachment of floating particles. Finally, quantifying the microturbulence effect on flotation requires further research.",

Optical techniques such as Laser Doppler Anemometry and Particle Image Velocimetry can produce accurate measurement results with high spatial and temporal resolution, but their applications are limited to transparent flows. Hot wire probes have high spatial and temporal resolution in turbulence quantification, but they are susceptible to environmental factors. Conductivity probe, Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) and piezoelectric sensor are techniques that can quantify turbulence in multiphase flows, but their spatial resolutions are limited. Particle Tracking Velocimetry can reveal particle trajectories in multiphase flows; it can also measure velocity fluctuation.

     "abstract": "It is clear that along with gas dispersion characteristics, the energy dissipated by the impeller is process determining in flotation, and its effect on flotation kinetics has been widely studied. However, turbulent conditions inside a flotation cell have usually only been changed by varying impeller speed or air flowrate or both. Therefore, there is a need to investigate not only these variables but also how changes in impeller/stator mechanism size and design, cell aspect ratio and cell design affect turbulence. This should lead to a better understanding of the effect of cell hydrodynamics on flotation performance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of flotation cell hydrodynamics on flotation performance in a fully instrumented 3\u00a0m3 cell. The cell was operated at a copper concentrator in Australia with different combinations of airflow rates, impeller speeds and sizes and cell aspect ratio providing a wide range of hydrodynamic conditions. An analysis of the flotation cell performance showed that the overall copper recoveries were very similar for the conditions tested. However, by decoupling pulp effects from froth effects it was possible to determine whether the changes made affected the pulp zone and/or froth zone responses. The analysis showed that the overall recovery had the potential to be up to 10% higher if not limited by froth recovery. Comparing the metallurgical performance of the cell with the different hydrodynamic conditions it was found that the collection zone flotation rate was not directly related to overall energy dissipation, as is commonly observed at laboratory scale, where energy is usually only changed by varying impeller tip speed. Results suggest that it is the size of the turbulent zone, rather than just energy input, that affects flotation recovery.",

Galena, pyrite, pentlandite (\u2212\u00a0150\u00a0\u03bcm), apatite (\u2212\u00a0650\u00a0\u03bcm), hematite (\u2212\u00a075\u00a0\u03bcm) and quartz (\u2212\u00a075\u00a0\u03bcm) were floated in the OGC at power intensities from 0.1 to 5.0\u00a0W/kg, using 0.13, 0.24, 0.58 and 0.82\u00a0mm bubbles, and at three collector dosages. Results show that the effect of power intensity on the flotation rate is strongly dependent on the mineral type, particle size, bubble size and collector dosage. In general, fine particles benefit from higher energy inputs, intermediate particles have an optimum energy input, and coarse particles do not benefit from agitation.",

     "abstract": "Turbulence is an important factor that affects flotation performance, which needs to be incorporated into flotation models. However, the measurement of turbulence in industrial flotation cells is difficult because of the highly abrasive and aggressive slurry environment. This has made the development and validation of models incorporating turbulence difficult. The development of a measurement methodology based on the piezoelectric vibration sensor (PVS) has enabled the measurement of kinetic energy fluctuation in flotation cells. In the study presented in this paper, the PVS was first applied to a sugary water-air two phase mixture in a 3\u00a0m3 pilot flotation cell, and then to a Metso RCS 3\u00a0m3 flotation test rig with magnetite/silica slurry and air, to collect turbulence data. An orthogonal experimental design was used for both sets of tests, with different impeller speeds, air flow rates and cell level (aspect ratio) as input hydrodynamic parameters. From the measurement data collected in the two cells, the volume of the turbulence zone could be modelled; from this, the turbulence distribution in the flotation cells could be predicted. The models were validated by comparing the predicted with the experimental results.",

The effect of shape of particles on entrainment after comminution may be influenced by the competency of the ore and the comminution procedure used since different breakage mechanisms will result in particles of different shapes. In the recovery of platinum group minerals (PGMs) the need to reduce the amount of chromite in the concentrate is of great importance and it is known that chromite reports to the concentrate through entrainment. The present paper reports on the entrainment of chromite of different particle sizes and relates these results to the shape of chromite particles by comparison with the entrainment of spherical ballotini particles and high aspect ratio wollastonite particles of similar sizes. Mixtures of chromite and ballotini were also studied and these results highlighted the critical role which such mixtures have on the behaviour of the froth. The relative effect of drag forces which can explain entrainment of particles of different shapes and the effect of settling velocity which is affected by particle mass and shape is discussed.",

Our approach is to prepare calcium carbonate by reacting calcium containing material with carbon dioxide. For this purpose, we used a solution containing 5\u00a0wt% amine and 15\u00a0vol% CO2 and ashes collected from an incineration facility. The experimental approach consisted of an extraction step and a carbonate formation step. The CO2 precipitate and waste ashes were analyzed by XRF, XRD, and SEM. Most of the CO2 emitted was precipitated, and the carbonate formed exhibited a cubic structure. Based on the results obtained, we conclude that valuable minerals can be recovered from waste materials.",

This work examines the effects of Custamine 8113 (collector) and Norlig-H (depressant) on the flotation of a muscovite ore from a mineralogical perspective using QEMSCAN. In addition to traditional grade-recovery curves for the various mineral components of the ore, the QEMSCAN data are used to look at: size-by-size flotation recoveries, particle size differences between flotation concentrates and tailings, and mineral liberation and association. The lab-scale flotation results are then compared to idealized size-by-size grade-recovery curves calculated from the measured QEMSCAN data.",

In this paper, we demonstrate these capabilities of DEM for machine design by exploring the performance variations in a HICOM mill with changing operating conditions (such as fill level and mill speed) and different material properties (such as particle size, density and friction). These predictions compare well with existing experimental observations and provide new insights into the flow dynamics inside the HICOM mill.

In the present work, we studied a cyclic alcohol, methyl cyclohexanemethanol (MCHM) with a high flash point (approximately 110\u00a0\u00b0C) and compared its coal flotation performance with that of MIBC. A bottom-driven mechanical flotation cell and two coking coals of distinct floatability, namely A and B, were used. Collectorless flotation tests were carried out with process water for coal A. Flotation tests with diesel as collector at 50\u00a0ppm were carried out with simulated process water (0.03\u00a0M NaCl solution) and highly saline water (0.5\u00a0M NaCl solution), respectively, for coal B. The flotation results showed that MCHM was an effective alternative to MIBC. The highly saline water produced sufficient frothing, obviating the necessity of adding MIBC or MCHM. To understand the effect of frother type and concentration and NaCl concentration on the coal flotation performance, we conducted surface tension measurement for the frother solutions, characterized the dispersion of air near bubble sparger, and measured the stabilities of froth, foam, and foam film. It was found that MCHM was more surface active and more capable of stabilizing froth and foam than MIBC. Foam film stability measured at a broad range of interface approach velocity followed a bell-shaped trend and at a given NaCl concentration, the observed peak foam film stability of 15\u00a0ppm MCHM was higher than that of 15\u00a0ppm MIBC. Increasing NaCl concentration from 0.03\u00a0M to 0.5\u00a0M had the effect of stabilizing the froth and foam but destabilising the thin foam film.",

Results indicate that the fixed carbon content of MG increased with the increasing amount of fluoride; with the increment of the liquid-solid ratio, reaction temperature, and reaction time. In all cases, the fixed carbon content significantly increased at first then slowed down its increasing rate.

The performance is to a large extent controlled by the internal flow conditions in the separator. In previous work, it was shown how an ultrasound pulse-echo setup can be used to simultaneously measure particle velocity profiles and local solids concentration variations in laboratory conditions.In this paper, a real-world case is demonstrated where the system is installed on one of the wet LIMS at the LKAB R&D facilities in Malmberget, Sweden. For the pilot scale experiments a setup with two ultrasound transducers, mounted at the bottom of the separator tank, is used. The design of experiments method is used to study the effects of the feed solids concentration, drum rotational speed, position of the concentrate weir, and the magnet assembly angle on the measured flow patterns. The results show that it is possible to detect changes in the flow velocity patterns and the local solids concentration, as the operational conditions of the separator are varied.Of the factors studied, the drum rotational speed has the strongest influence on the overall flow velocity in the dewatering zone. Also, the presence of a recirculating flow transporting gangue particles away from the concentrate is confirmed. The factor with the strongest influence on this recirculating flow is also the drum rotational speed, together with the magnet assembly angle. Using this method it is possible to make high quality measurements of internal flow velocity profiles. It is also possible to monitor material build-up on the separator drum, and e.g. detect overload of magnetic material. The insights gained, and the methods developed, have generated new possibilities to control, optimise, and develop the wet LIMS process.",

     "abstract": "Continuous high-throughput microwave treatment followed by infrared thermal imaging (MW-IR) has previously been shown to provide attractive separations for a number of porphyry copper ores, leading to rejection of a large proportion of barren fragments from ore-grade material or concentration of copper values from waste-grade material. However, the efficacy of the sorting process is reduced by the presence of hydrated clays and pyrite. Literature measurements have shown differences in the conductivity of pyrite and copper sulphides such as chalcopyrite at radio frequencies. In this work the potential of using radio frequency (RF) heating to exploit these differences and achieve improved selectivity between copper and iron sulphides, is investigated. For the first time a novel bulk materials handling and presentation method that facilitates even heating of angular ore fragments in parallel plate RF systems is discussed. The fragment-by-fragment thermal response of five ore samples under equivalent pilot MW-IR and RF-IR processing conditions is evaluated, showing that there is an increase in selectivity in the heating of hydrated clay minerals in RF compared to microwave. It is suggested, again for the first time, that selectivity in the microwave processing of ores containing semi-conducting minerals is due predominantly to magnetic absorption (induction heating) caused by eddy currents associated with the magnetic field component of electromagnetic energy. In radio frequency processing, where electric field is the dominant component, heating of semi-conducting minerals is limited by the electric field screening effect. This effect is demonstrated using synthetic fragments. Thermal response profiles of synthetic fragments show that approximately 2.5 times the mass of sulphide minerals to hydrated clay minerals would result in an equal temperature increase for microwave heated fragments in which the microwave-heating minerals are evenly disseminated throughout the matrix. This understanding provides the foundations for development of models incorporating different thermal responses for individual heated phases, alongside other textural and treatment variables, that can be used to predict how close to intrinsic sortability ores will perform in MW-IR and RF-IR without the need for extensive processing trials.",

Since thiosalts are metastable species that are oxidized to sulphuric acid as an end product, they cannot be discharged nor recycled into the process. Therefore, the development of a cost-effective process for the treatment of these effluents is necessary. In this paper, the continuous bio-oxidation of tetrathionate is carried out in a flooded packed-bed reactor by an immobilized microbial consortium. Batch tests show that the initial tetrathionate concentration and pH slightly affect the tetrathionate bio-oxidation process in the ranges 3 to 5\u00a0g/L and 1.5 to 2, respectively. The specific bio-oxidation rate is 0.08\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01. Only sulphate ions and protons have been detected as end products. For the starting up of the bioreactor, a new method of biofilm formation for tetrathionate bio-oxidation is implemented. The maximum bio-oxidation rate in continuous operation is 0.415\u00a0gh\u2212\u00a01 (0.830\u00a0kg\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01\u00a0m\u2212\u00a03).

Tween 80 primarily improved the combustible matter recovery of low density (<\u00a01.4\u00a0kg/dm3) particles. However, the flotation recoveries of medium (1.4\u20131.8\u00a0kg/dm3) and high (>\u00a01.8\u00a0kg/dm3) density particles also increased at higher dosages of Tween 80.

According to the FTIR test, there were numerous oxygen-bearing functional groups on the surface of the lignite. The maximum height and half-life time of the three-phase froth were measured by the gas pulsation method. The surface tension and viscosity of the flotation pulp were also examined by an automatic surface tension meter and a rotational viscometer, respectively. The results show that the maximum froth height and half-life time of the three-phase froth increased because the Tween 80 was capable of decreasing the surface tension and increasing the viscosity of the flotation pulp. The enhancement of the froth properties by Tween 80 was the main reason for the increase in the combustible matter recovery of lignite in flotation.",

The three-compartment ball mill was modelled by using the perfect mixing modelling approach [1]. Classification performance of the intermediate and discharge diaphragms of the ball mill were modelled by the efficiency curve approach [2]. Second and third compartments were combined and the mill was simulated as a two-compartment by using the JKSimMet simulation program. Grinding capacity increase when the three-compartment ball mill was converted to a two-compartment ball mill was evaluated by simulation. The same cylpebs size distribution and load were assumed to be applied in the second compartment of the new mill design. Simulation result showed that, 10% capacity increase can be achieved with 16% material retained on 0.045\u00a0mm in the mill discharge when the mill was converted to a two-compartment mill.",

However, low selectivity of NaOl and large amount of sodium silicate (SS) needed remain tough problems. In this study, octyl hydroxamic acid (HXMA-8) was used as an associate collector with NaOl in scheelite flotation. The flotation tests showed that a novel reagent scheme, i.e., a lower dosage of SS (300\u00a0mg/L) and mixed collectors of HXMA-8\u00a0+\u00a0NaOl (total concentration 4.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a04\u00a0mol/L, preferred mass ratio of 1:2) achieved the selective separation of scheelite from calcite. Zeta potential measurements indicated that the depressant, SS, adsorbed more strongly on calcite surface than on scheelite surface. HXMA-8 adsorbed significantly on scheelite surface either in the absence or presence of SS by chemical bonding between oxygens of HXMA-8 and surface metal ions. NaOl also adsorbed on both mineral surfaces by chemisorption, but the adsorption on calcite surface was influenced adversely by the presence of SS.",

A comprehensive test program requires large amount of representative samples, takes long time and could be costly. Hence, developing alternative cost effective, fast and low cost methods have recently been in the subject of many research studies. Microflotation, induction time measurement, electrochemical methods, etc. have been used to measure adsorption of flotation reagents and derive a proxy to correlate with flotation behaviors of sulfide minerals. In this study, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) method was used to measure rate of collector adsorption on two different pyrite rich samples from flotation plants processing Carlin and Yanacocha Verde ores. Eight different types of collectors were selected based on their chemistry and applications in flotation operations. Adsorption of the collectors were also measured by using Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) technique and correlated with EIS results. The results showed clearly that Carlin pyrite was more electrochemically reactive than Verde pyrite. Rate of adsorption of the collectors was related to coating resistance (Rc), which was calculated using an equivalent electrical circuit model fitted to the EIS data. Based on Rc values, order of adsorption of the collectors for Carlin and Verde samples were discussed. It is therefore shown that preliminary reagent selection for a specific ore can be done using EIS technique, which is considerably faster and low cost compared to the other techniques.",

The modus operandi of performance optimization is important for quick and non-invasive monitoring of hydrocyclone performance. Therefore, in the present study, an application potential of spray angle as a performance monitoring tool has been explored to investigate the operation state of a hydrocyclone. In this context, phenomenological features of spray discharge over a wide range of injection pressure and feed solid concentration have been investigated. The emphasis of the present study is to verse the amendment of the hydrocyclone operational state with the corresponding change in underflow discharge pattern. The pattern of the underflow discharge profile was captured using a digital camera and analyzed based on an image processing algorithm to detect the discharge angle under different operating and design conditions. Stability and reproducibility of the spray angle at fixed operating condition have also been confirmed. Subsequent analysis shows that the spray angle is sensitive to variations of operating and design variables. More specifically the effect of feed slurry concentration has been characterized and is of major importance for the transition to roping. On this basis, an attempt has also been made to develop an empirical correlation based on experimental data. The developed correlation shows that the discharge angle could possibly be used as a reliable tool to monitor hydrocyclone performance.",

     "abstract": "Process models in mineral processing can be classified based on the level of information required from the ore, i.e. the feed stream to the processing plant. Mineral processing models usually require information on total solid flow rate, mineralogical composition and particle size information. The most comprehensive level of mineral processing models is the particle-based one (liberation level), which gives particle-by-particle information on their mineralogical composition, size, density, shape i.e. all necessary information on the processed material for simulating unit operations. In flowsheet simulation, the major benefit of a particle-based model over other models is that it can be directly linked to any other particle-based unit models in the process simulation. This study aims to develop a unit operation model for a wet low intensity magnetic separator on particle property level. The experimental data was gathered in a plant survey of the KA3 iron ore concentrator of Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB in Kiruna. Corresponding feed, concentrate and tailings streams of the primary magnetic separator were sampled, assayed and mass balanced on mineral liberation level. The mass-balanced data showed that the behavior of individual particles in the magnetic separation is depending on their size and composition. The developed model involves a size and composition dependent entrapment parameter and a separation function that depends on the magnetic volume of the particle and the nature of gangue mineral. The model is capable of forecasting the behavior of particles in magnetic separation with the necessary accuracy. This study highlights the benefits that particle-based models in simulation offer whereas lower level process models fail to provide.",

Also, linked with the GRA, the Gravity Release Index (GRI) was developed for ranking the ore amenability to centrifugal gravity concentration. Ore samples from the flotation circuit of Myra Falls concentrator were subjected to Multi Pass Test and Gravity Amenability Test for comparison with GRA. Recovery kinetics of batch centrifugal concentration was analysed to establish the Gravity Release Index (GRI). Both Gravity Amenability Test and Multi Pass Test failed to cover the broader mass yield range of continuous centrifugal concentration and this was the main drawback in performance prediction of larger units from lab-scale data. GRA covered a wider mass yield range, yielding better performance prediction of larger continuous units. From the gravity recovery kinetics of the batch unit, varying GRI values for Au, Fe, Zn, Fe and S were obtained, with Au having the highest- GRI and amenability to centrifugal gravity concentration. Varying amenabilities for different Au forms (free Au particles, Au bearing sulphides) to centrifugal gravity concentration could also be distinguished. SEM analysis on recovered gold entities justified the prediction by the GRI. Overall, GRA could effectively predict continuous centrifugal concentration using small amounts of feed with lab-scale batch units. Determination of the GRI for targeted metals would provide further precision for bench-marking and scaling-up of continuous centrifugal concentration.",

The flotation results show that PAC significantly reduced the concentrate ash content. The particle size measurements and the aggregate images show that kaolinite was aggregated by low concentration PAC and was dispersed by high concentration PAC while coal was not aggregated by PAC. The zeta potential measurements indicate that PAC neutralized the negative charge of kaolinite at low concentration and then increased the positive charge of kaolinite at high concentration.

The variation of relevant operating variables is also reported, as the split ratio and the Euler number characterizing the device. It is verified that for large values of the back-pressure the water flow through the sink is hindered and the air core disappears. The flow pattern is moderately altered when the cyclone is fed with a non-Newtonian fluid with the same viscosity as a real water/magnetite dense medium.",

Due to the formation of Cu3As, the economic value of high-arsenic silver bearing copper ore is greatly reduced, and the copper recovery ratio declines. Arsenic in the silver bearing copper ore is a punitive element in a trade. It is verified that arsenic could be removed from tennantite and most of sulfur is retained satisfactorily at low oxygen pressure.Investigation has been carried out for arsenic removal from a silver bearing copper ore. The copper ore was roasted in nitrogen atmosphere (>\u00a099%) at temperatures ranging from 923.15\u00a0K to1123.15\u00a0K. By suitably adjusting the main reaction conditions, nearly 98% arsenic was removed at 1053.15\u00a0K for 3\u00a0h in nitrogen atmosphere, while most of the sulfur was particularly retained in the copper ore. After the arsenic removal, the arsenic content was reduced from 7.81% to 0.13% and the copper ore could be used for feeding the smelter. Compared with the traditional method of arsenic removal from copper ore by roasting in oxygen, our proposed method of arsenic removal in nitrogen atmosphere at temperature of 1053.15\u00a0K is more effective.",

The percentage of reduction was determined by thermogravimetry method with a precision of 0.001\u00a0g. The results obtained showed that the hematite pellets were first reduced to metallic iron and then cementite is formed. The kinetic modeling has shown that the reduction rate of hematite pellets is controlled by the mixed mechanism of chemical reaction-diffusion at the interface of and the rate of the formation of cementite is controlled by the chemical reaction of methane adsorption on the surface of reduced iron. On the other hand, the results showed that the temperature and time of the process are the two very important factors in the formation of cementite and its stability. In fact, by increasing the temperature (from 700\u00a0\u00b0C to 800\u00a0\u00b0C) led to increase in the rate of cementite formation. But, selection of an appropriate temperature can be very effective in the rate of the decomposition of cementite into metallic iron and graphite. The results of XRD and Feritscope demonstrated that at 750\u00a0\u00b0C over time even for 80\u00a0min, a negligible percentage of cementite is decomposed. Furthermore, the images obtained from SEM and RLM showed that an increase in time can also change the formed cementite morphology from layer state to block state.",

The results of investigation indicate that changes in the rotation speed and inclination angle as well as the rinsing water consumption have significant influences on the performance, and an increase in these variables increases the Fe2O3 grade but decreases the iron removal rate of non-magnetic product.

The structures of the extracted metal species showed by FT-IR investigations indicated the presence of OH\u2013 and NO3\u2212 groups. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters associated with the extraction process were evaluated. Based on the obtained results, as well as those obtained in a previous publication for the extraction of Pr (III), Sm (III) and Nd (III) with CYANEX 923 under similar conditions, a process for the recovery of REE from the Egyptian monazite was proposed and evaluated.",

     "abstract": "Controlling the initial release rate of alumina and silica from source materials is known to have a significant effect on the nanostructure of geopolymer gel and its final mechanical properties. However, most of the studies regarding the solubility of source materials take an equilibrium approach, and there is a gap in understanding of the release rates at far-from-equilibrium conditions. In the present study, the initial dissolution rate of some geopolymer precursors is characterised. The liquid to solid ratios are designed to be sufficiently high to minimise precipitation of hydration products, and the effects of solution alkalinity and milling on dissolution rates are investigated. While fly ash and blast furnace slag particles seem to release Si and Al at approximately similar rates, metakaolin shows a distinctively higher release of Si from the very early time of dissolution. Increasing solution alkalinity increases the dissolution of source materials up to some point, and the greatest effect is observed on fly ash particles. The most interesting result of milling is observed on fly ash particles where the release rate of silica has become higher than alumina, while contrasting behaviour is observed in the non-milled fly ash system. The opposite behaviour is observed in the slag system where milling rapidly increases the release rate of Al while the release rate of Si is increased slowly.",

It was found that even in alkaline solutions, HMBT adsorbed in addition to molecular CuMBT, (MBT)2 and chemisorbed MBT on Cu metal, CuI oxide or Cu sulfide minerals. For all Cu-containing surfaces conditioned in a collector solution of concentration higher than 10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0M, adsorbed molecular (multilayer) CuMBT remained a minor species within the pH range investigated. For substantial collector coverage, when the concentration of adsorbed HMBT and (MBT)2 exceeded that of chemisorbed MBT and adsorbed CuMBT, the surface was not obviously hydrophobic. Neither a Cu nor Fe surface oxide layer was predominantly removed by the collector, but MBT chemisorption involved direct interaction with surface Cu atoms rather than via intermediate O atoms. There was strong evidence for a Cu\u2014N interaction in bulk CuMBT, and hence in MBT chemisorbed on surface Cu atoms, in addition to the principal interaction through the MBT exocyclic S atom. It was concluded that adsorption of some multilayer MBT species on Cu sulfide ore minerals can be deleterious, and this should be taken into account when variably oxidised ores are being processed.",

A new process of alumina extraction from HAFA is proposed in this paper. This method involved the raw HAFA being treated first by a low concentration alkali solution to form desilicated HAFA and then alumina was effectively extracted from desilicated HAFA in mixed alkali solution (NaOH\u00a0+\u00a0Ca(OH)2). The effects of the reaction conditions on alumina leaching from desilicated HAFA were investigated. The extraction efficiency of alumina could reach 92.0% under the following optimal conditions: alkali to ash ratio of 6, calcium to silicate ratio of 1.0, and reaction temperature of 280\u00a0\u00b0C. After alumina extracted from desilicated HAFA, the solid residues were collected and characterized to better understand the mechanism of mineral phase transition of desilicated HAFA with alumina extraction in mixed alkali solution.

     "publication date": "07-2016",
     "abstract": "Reverse anionic flotation of carbonate-containing iron ores is quite a challenging process. Studies on this ores conducted in many laboratories or beneficiation plants have obtained poor concentrate grades and separation between quartz and iron minerals, even when valuable minerals are adequately liberated. The presence of carbonate minerals, such as siderite, causes a detrimental effect on quartz flotation recovery (froth product) and separation selectivity between quartz and iron minerals. In this work, the effect of carbonate minerals on quartz flotation from iron mineral was investigated using sodium oleate as collector, starch and calcium as regulators. Microflotation, adsorption, PHREEQC calculation, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted in the investigation. Carbonate minerals (i.e., siderite and dolomite) adversely affected the floatability of quartz and separation between quartz and hematite. Starch dosage experiment results clearly showed that the reduction of quartz recovery in the presence of carbonate minerals was mainly related to starch. In addition, mineral dissolution and sodium carbonate dosage experiments evidently exhibited that CO32\u00a0\u2212 dissolved species of carbonate minerals passively affected quartz flotation recovery. By contrast, both starch and CO32\u00a0\u2212 dissolved species of carbonate minerals adversely affected the flotation recovery. FTIR showed that the strong drop-off in quartz recovery in the presence of carbonate minerals was due to the adsorption of CaCO3 precipitations on quartz surfaces and further their interaction with starch molecules. The appearance of CaCO3 precipitations was caused by reaction of Ca2\u00a0+ from the hydrolysis of CaCl2 and CO32\u00a0\u2212 dissolved species of carbonate minerals. To decrease the passive effect, a potential strategy to improve the flotation performance of iron ores that contain carbonate minerals at strong alkaline pH is suggested to remove carbonate minerals before separation between hematite and quartz.",

Different serpentine minerals, that form serpentinite rocks, feature divergent characteristics that influence the eventual suitability of a serpentinite rock for CCM. The present study focuses on these characteristics, sub-divides them and explains how each characteristic influences the suitability. The carbonation method employed in this study is developed at \u00c5bo Akademi University. The good, yet sometimes inconsistent results gained with this method, gave grounds to a closer mineralogical study. Samples in this study consist of an antigorite dominating serpentinite, a lizardite dominating serpentinite, an antigorite seam, a lizardite rock and a serpentinite rock with high water content (15.15%). A serpentinite tailing is used as a base sample. Mineralogical studies were executed with an optical microscope, Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDX) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD).The results state that the characteristics that influence the suitability of a serpentinite rock for mineral carbonation are the mineralogical structure, parent rock and later transformation of the rock through metamorphosis or other type of alteration. The features that positively influence the suitability are more common in lizardite than in antigorite.As serpentinite rocks are widely available, additional knowledge on their behavior based on the mineralogical characteristics, and understanding these variables, enables improvement of the method and widens its range of application. The results can also be used as guidelines to other rocks that are found to be possible raw materials for the carbonation method. The results do not apply to carbonation processes only, but also other purposes, for example among industrial exploitations of quarried materials and their further utilization as profitable goods.",

However many of the breakage events inside industrial mills are due to relatively low energy collisions, accumulating internal damage resulting in body or surface breakage of particles. Incremental breakage, as it is known, occurs across a wide range of equipment and milling operations. The authors have investigated the probability of breakage during these repetitive impacts. A standardised procedure has been developed for incremental breakage testing where unbroken particles are selected for re-breakage after each breakage event. Breakage probability is then calculated from the relative mass of broken particles. The test results show that incremental breakage occurs under repetitive impacts and the JKRBT is a suitable device for incremental testing. The Vogel and Peukert method for multiple impacts has been modified to more accurately account for size dependency. The influence of particle shape, on the minimum energy of comminution, or threshold energy, Emin, and the applicability of the proposed approach to model the breakage probabilities are discussed.",

     "abstract": "In copper metallurgy, antimony impurities usually form alloys and compounds with the transition metals to make up the basic building blocks of a speiss phase. This speiss phase is generally rich in copper and precious metals, which are desirable to recycle and recover at the smelter. The presence of this impurity unfortunately creates a build-up of this metal in the copper circuit, leading to problems during copper refining processes. Therefore, a removal or reduction of the antimony impurity to an acceptable level is a necessary step before the speiss can be recycled at the smelter for the recovery of its valuable metals. A lead silicate slag that was obtained after smelting a copper speiss admixed with silica, soda and lead oxide, was leached in alkaline sulphide solution to selectively dissolve its antimony content. Furthermore, the pregnant sulphide leachate was purified by precipitation and crystallization techniques to recover antimony as sodium thioantimonate and sodium hydroxyl antimonate using synthetic Na2S-NaOH-Sb2S3 solutions. The leaching results indicate that the highest amount of antimony and arsenic extracted from the material after 24\u00a0h at 100\u00a0\u00b0C and reagent concentration of 30\u00a0g/L NaOH\u00a0+\u00a030\u00a0g/L\u00a0S2\u00a0\u2212 was 83% and 90%, respectively. In the precipitation process, the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the alkaline sulphide leachate prompts the precipitation of antimony as NaSb(OH)6. The result also implies that <\u00a0100% of stoichiometric hydrogen peroxide is required to completely oxidize the total amounts of both Sb3\u00a0+ and S2\u00a0\u2212 in the solution and to quantitatively precipitate >\u00a090% of the antimony in solution. The influence of catalytic agents and temperature on the process was not clearly reflected in this investigation due to the exothermic reaction with hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the addition of elemental sulphur to the sulphide leachate also influences the precipitation of antimony as sodium thioantimonate.",

Carburization behaviors of these pre-reduced powders were then explored using undiluted CH4 at 800\u00a0K. Mass change measurements, XRD and SEM analyses were used to characterize the samples. It was found that single Fe3C phase was obtained from the pre-reduced powders containing 3.26 and 0.59\u00a0wt.% oxygen for carburization periods of 15 and 30\u00a0min. The kinetic data for the carburization under pure CH4 indicates that there are essentially two successive distinct regimes: reduction of the remaining oxides and Fe3C formation. When the pre-reduced powder with oxygen contents of 3.26 and 0.59\u00a0wt.% are used, CH4 pyrolysis rate suffices for the reduction of the remaining oxides and carburization. The pre-reduced powder with the highest oxygen (12.36\u00a0wt.% oxygen) did not yield Fe3C, but iron and iron oxides, because the extent of the reduction by CH4 is found to be too small for such high oxygen content. It was postulated that the reduction product H2O vapor hinders the formation of Fe3C. The carburization process was discussed in terms of reaction pathways using equilibrium thermodynamic analysis and reaction kinetics.",

The method is based upon the scanning microwave microscopy technique that enables measurement of the dielectric constant, loss factor and conductivity with extremely high spatial resolution and accuracy.

It was shown that (i) particle concentration at inlet had a remarkable influence on particle separation efficiency, but had a negligible effect upon processing capacity, expressed as the inlet volumetric flow rate of liquid\u2013solid mixture; (ii) the increase of the length of vortex finder resulted in a slight decrease of separation efficiency and larger diameter of vortex finder led to increased mass flow rate through overflow and slightly decreased separation efficiency; (iii) increasing the height of cylindrical part resulted in a larger mass flow rate through underflow and better particle separation efficiency.

In this manner, milling conditions at which crystalline colemanite transforms to amorphous structure were obtained. Thermal gravimetric (TG) analyses together with differential thermal (DTA) and differential thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis were performed to determine how prolonged milling affects the thermal behavior of colemanite. It was found by examining the DTA data that intensive milling gives rise to removal of the crystal water from colemanite at low temperatures, which can be attributed to mechanical activation. DTG analysis revealed that mechanical activation decreases the rate of water removal from colemanite structure throughout the heating. It was suggested that mechanical activation eliminates the decrepitation almost completely, so that there is no need for pre-calcining operation which is generally required before manufacturing the colemanite-based high temperature materials.",

Therefore, these types of cells (or similar) should be tested in processing laterite ores. In addition, increasing particle size often results in enhancing the particle\u2013bubble interaction in flotation. Selective flocculation of fine particles could be therefore the key parameter to improve the flotation performance of laterite ores. Flocculation of these type of ores needs to be thoroughly investigated.",

Therefore, to confirm the crushing efficiency of recyclable solidified iron ore, the microstructural, thermal, and mechanical properties were analyzed as a function of cooling rate. When the cooling rate was increased from 5 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min, the density of the iron ore decreased from 5.391 to 5.271\u00a0g/cm3, and the Fe2O3 phase formed. Additionally, the Fe2SiO4 phase formed when the cooling rate was more than 27\u00a0\u00b0C/min; and, as a result of water quenching (953\u00a0\u00b0C/min), mixed crystalline (Fe2SiO4) and amorphous phases formed, the density was decreased to 4.714\u00a0g/cm3, and crack and void density increased. Thermal analysis showed that crystallization temperature decreased from 1390 to 1357\u00a0\u00b0C as the cooling rate was increased from 5 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min and the activation energy was 677\u00a0kJ/mol for the Fe2O3 phase. When the cooling rate was increased above 27\u00a0\u00b0C/min, only minor exotherms were observed. Therefore, when the cooling rate was increased from 5 to 953\u00a0\u00b0C/min, the Vickers hardness and flexural strength decreased by about 41% and 59%, respectively. Consequently, to produce a solidified iron ore having a Fe2O3 crystalline phase without a heterogeneous element, while increasing its crushing efficiency, the optimum cooling rate was confirmed to be 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min.",

Optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) were used to identify the phases in the studied samples.

The identified phases with XRD in the raw materials were hematite and goethite. In the calcined samples, only hematite was identified because of the thermal decomposition of goethite. The density, specific surface area, specific pore volume and pore diameter of the calcined samples increased compared to those of the natural sinter feed samples. Hematite, brownmillerite, anorthite, and gehlenite were identified in the sintered samples. The sites for phosphorus occurrence were calcium silicates and apatite. The sintered samples exhibited specific surface areas lower than those of the calcined samples. This result was ascribed to the destruction of the pore structure by the sintering process.

     "publication date": "04-2016",
     "abstract": "The removal of sulfate ions from wastewater is an environmental challenge faced by several industrial sectors, such as the mining, metallurgical, chemical and petrochemical industries. Most existing options are inefficient and costly, particularly for sulfate-bearing acid mine drainage (AMD; coal and metal sulfides). This work focused on the precipitation of sulfate with polyaluminum chloride at pH\u00a04.5 at the bench scale and their separation by flotation. However, these hydrophilic precipitates did not float via dissolved air flotation (DAF) and needed to be flocculated with cationic polyacrylamide. The best removal of sulfate-sodium salts from solution was obtained using an Al/SO42\u00a0\u2212 molar ratio of 4:1 and 20\u00a0mg\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01 of polymer flocculant. The sulfate-bearing flocs were readily removed from the aqueous solutions by microbubbles (MBs, 30\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm) and nanobubbles (NBs, 150\u2013800\u00a0nm). The separation was very rapid and followed a first-order flotation kinetics model with a high rate constant of 4.1\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01. The results were validated using AMD generated by a coal mine with a sulfate concentration of 1753\u00a0mg\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01, and the anion concentration was rapidly reduced to below the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 500\u00a0mg\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01. Attempts to improve the removal efficiency with sodium oleate flotation collector and conditioning with NBs were not successful. The maximum removal percentage (80\u201382% of the feed content) appears to be limited by the efficiency of the DAF process and the chemical equilibrium of the precipitates, which leaves some soluble sulfate in solution. Bubbles readily attach to the flocs and become entrained and/or entrapped in the flocs, creating aerated flocs. Because all of these mechanisms operate simultaneously, the flotation of the flocs is very rapid, as indicated by the high kinetics rate constant. We concluded that the DAF of sulfate-loaded flocs has potential for the treatment of voluminous sulfate-bearing effluents, including coal AMD, at high superficial rates.",

     "abstract": "In Zijinshan, a commercial copper bio-heap leaching plant has been operating successfully since 2006. The plant used raffinate as irrigation solution and operated at low pH and high iron concentration from 2006 to 2010. However, high concentration of soluble iron led to crud formation and low current efficiency in subsequent solvent extraction and electro-winning (SX-EW) steps. It is important to reduce iron dissolution in bioleaching and address this low current efficiency issue. About 1500\u00a0m3/h acid mine drainage (AMD) accumulated in collection pool in the Zijinshan copper mine. Not only does it cause the loss of copper, but also result in potentially secondary pollution. This paper proposes an option to use AMD as leaching solution for the recovery of copper. Column bioleaching experiments were performed with low-grade secondary copper sulfide ore from Zijinshan. To simulate leaching, several variables such as irrigation solution, leachate treatment (with or without recirculation), irrigation duration, temperature and pH were considered for the evaluation of the copper recovery and iron extraction. Results showed that 6\u20138\u00a0h/d irrigation was needed to ensure the wetting of the ore surface, to keep sufficiently high temperature and aeration inside the column. Under optimal pH condition of 1.6\u20131.8, with recirculation of AMD, copper leaching reached 90%, however iron leaching was only 20% both after 240\u00a0days, respectively. About 78\u201386% of copper extraction was observed in the first 100\u00a0days and then slight increase of about 4\u201312% towards the end, whereas iron extraction continued with an upward trend after 100\u00a0days. The results showed that AMD could be utilized for selective and efficient copper recovery in Zijinshan copper mine.",

In this respect, monazite digestion was carried out in sulfuric acid media with low or high acid/monazite ratio. These two ratios were designed to explore the acid efficiency for leaching Th and REE) in the presence of high phosphate media (P2O5\u00a0\u2248\u00a025%). The original monazite sample (grade 50%) was analyzed by XRF to evaluate the existing elements and their concentrations. A series of experiments was firstly applied to remove various element impurities (such as Na, Ca, and Si) which exist in the monazite sample and create a series of interferences with the main product (REEs). The results are likely promising for removal of the interfering ions specially Na, Ca and Si. These elements usually complicate the separation of the main elements (REEs). A series of experiments was constructed to digest the monazite sample with a low amount of concentrated H2SO4 and to explore the separation possibility of Th from REEs in successive steps at different BaCl2 weights that act as precipitating agent. The results demonstrated that, firstly selective thorium precipitation (99.3%) was obtained at pH\u00a00.9. Secondly, the phosphate ions (83.3%) could be successfully separated from the mixed REE cake. Thirdly, separation of light REEs (LREEs) from the mixed cake was then performed by disodium sulfate. The precipitation efficiency of double sulfate for LREEs reached 92, 79 and 82% for Ce, Nd and La respectively. Finally, the remaining REE-phosphate was converted to REE-hydroxide precipitate at pH\u00a07 then leached with dilute HCl at pH\u00a03 and treated with 3% oxalic acid to precipitate Y and the other HREEs as HREE-oxalate.

Under Ar flow, the oxide powder was slightly reduced to Ni as temperature increased to 1300\u00a0K. In CH4 atmosphere, the oxide reduction was followed by C deposition with increasing temperature. Complete reduction of NiO to Ni was attained at ~\u00a01000\u00a0K owing to H2 formed by CH4 pyrolysis.

     "abstract": "In a sintering bed the generation of melt in the descending flame front causes the coalescence of material and the transformation of the particulate bed. Interspersed between the large voids are the densified lumps of sinter which are released on crushing and used as blast furnace feed. The bed transformation process is critical in sintering and is an outcome of the work done on the material by the surface and opposing viscous forces. Less densified, weaker sinter forms when the level of coalescence achieved is low. The process is extremely complex in that it involves a three-phase melt\u2013solids\u2013gas system.In this study, the composition of the sinter bed was simulated using the pressed cylinders of laboratory grade chemicals and the coalescence process was studied by characterising the densification of the cylinders. The alumina, magnesia and basicity of the cylinders were altered (1\u20134%, 0\u20132% and 0\u20133, respectively) to change the properties of the melt and also its solid content. The estimation of solid\u2013melt content, melt composition, viscosity and surface tension was obtained using a thermodynamic model (FactSage) and the reported equations in the literature. Using these results Laplace number of the system was determined as a function of temperature. At the completion of some tests the cooled solidified samples were studied under a microscope.The experimental results showed that the higher sinter density and densification factor were obtained when temperature and sinter mix basicity increased and alumina levels decreased. The effect of magnesia level on densification was less because the porosity of the cylinders altered with magnesium carbonate levels. The trends obtained in sinter densification are consistent with the micro-structural information indicated by optical micrographs. The use of Laplace number to quantify the relative influence of the surface to viscous forces on coalescence was encouraging with a prediction error within \u00b1\u00a010%. It was also concluded that the most influential factor determining densification factor was the apparent viscosity of the molten mix as the change in surface force was comparatively small.",

Experiments were carried out under air at different temperatures from 600\u00a0\u00b0C to 1200\u00a0\u00b0C by a certain amount of SiO2 mixing with Fe2O3 and Ca(OH)2. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy were used to characterize the phase change of the sintered samples. The results show that the initial product of SiO2 that participated in the formation process of SFC is 2CaO\u00b7SiO2 (C2S) that mainly forms by the reaction of SiO2 and CaO\u00b7Fe2O3 (CF) at approximately 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. Subsequently, C2S that disappears with it reacts with Fe2O3 and CF respectively to form SFC at approximately 1100\u00a0\u00b0C. The reaction of C2S and Fe2O3 is more easily to occur compared with C2S and CF through the thorough solid-state reaction experiments between C2S, Fe2O3, and CF, and the formation of SFC will be promoted by the co-existence of Fe2O3 and CF that the optimal mole ratio of Fe2O3 to CF is approximately 1.00:0.55. Finally, melt appears at approximately 1200\u00a0\u00b0C due to the effect of the eutectic structure composed of SFC and CF.",

     "abstract": "In the present work, Tunisian phosphogypsum was considered as a source of rare earths. After examining the particle size distribution of the raw sample and its rare earths repartition by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), a double sulfuric leaching of the sample led to rare earths dissolution, then, the evaporation of the acid liquor allowed to recover a rare earths-rich solid. During the process, all the obtained solids were identified by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction, and rare earths content was also measured after each step by ICP-MS. Analytical results showed that the first acid leaching allowed essentially to impurities dissolution (such as fluorides and phosphates) and so rare earths enrichment in the residue (about 52%), whereas the second leaching led to the dissolution of such elements in the sulfuric acid liquor (about 50%). The crystallized solid obtained after the evaporation stage corresponds to a mixture of anhydrite-monetit phases with a total rare earths enrichment of about 86%. The method showed also its efficiency for purifying the phosphogypsum which can be used safely in industrial applications. Photoluminescence measurements carried on the phosphogypsum sample and the crystallized solid allowed the observation of some rare earths emissions (cerium, europium and samarium) and confirmed as well their enrichment in the final solid at the end of the process.",

     "abstract": "The influence of fine particles on the flotation separation of minerals is becoming increasingly important as new, fine grained deposits are exploited. Fine particles float poorly and less selectively under normal flotation conditions, having detrimental effects on recovery of other minerals. The reasons of this interacting effect are complex, which may be entrainment, pH variation, dissolved ions from mineral surfaces, aggregation/dispersion and coating behavior of particles or even the competitive adsorption effect. In this study, the influence of fine magnesite and dolomite on the flotation of quartz was investigated. It was found that at pH\u00a0=\u00a09.2\u20139.5 and with DDA dosage of 8.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a04, the recovery of coarse (\u2212\u00a0100\u00a0+\u00a065\u00a0\u03bcm) quartz was reduced dramatically from 96.66% to 37.15% when the content of quartz was 5% in the flotation with fine (\u2212\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcm) magnesite, and when the content of fine dolomite was increased from 2.5% to 20%, the recovery of coarse quartz was reduced from 91.20% to 75.08%. To examine the reasons, zeta potential, zero point of charge and contact angles of magnesite, dolomite and quartz were measured in the absence and presence of dodecylamine (DDA). The interaction energies between particles were then calculated. Results showed that the aggregation behavior of mineral particles was likely to be the reason. Interaction energy calculated based on Extended-DLVO (Derjaguin\u2013Landau\u2013Verwey\u2013Overbeek) theory predicted that in DDA surfactant solution, the interaction forces between magnesite and quartz, dolomite and quartz were attractive, between dolomite and magnesite was repulsive. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretically predicted results. The aggregation caused by interacting behavior explains the depressing effect of fine hydrophilic particles on magnesite reverse flotation.",

Currently, there is increasing interest in new technologies to recycle and utilize mine tailings more effectively in the future. In this present study, the geopolymerization of mine tailings has been studied. Sulphidic mine tailings from a gold mining site were activated with a NaOH solution and commercial ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) was used as a co-binder. Characterization of the mine tailings and the mechanical strength of the specimens produced were investigated. In addition, the effects of different NaOH concentrations and the amount of co-binder materials on a matrix were tested. The porosity of the specimens produced was evaluated using water absorption tests, the microstructure of the fractures was analyzed with field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and the crystalline phases were identified by X-ray diffraction. The results show that the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the specimens produced from pure mine tailings was in the range of 1.3\u20133.5\u00a0MPa. The UCS increased and water permeability decreased with 5% GGBFS content in the mixture. By optimizing the NaOH concentration and GGBFS content, the UCS of the specimens varied from 1.8\u00a0MPa to 25\u00a0MPa. The alkali-activation of mine tailings allows binders to be made with sufficient compressive strength, which can be used as a backfill in mining sites or raw material in the construction industry.",

The use of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as a chlorinating agent allowed iron to be directly removed from various types of Ti ores. In the experiments, titanium ore was first pre-oxidized under air, and then reacted with TiCl4 gas at 1100\u00a0K or 1200\u00a0K for 9\u00a0h under an Ar\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a0ppm O2, Ar\u00a0+\u00a01% O2, or Ar\u00a0+\u00a010% O2 gas flow. The iron in the low-grade Ti ore was selectively removed as iron chlorides (FeClx [x\u00a0=\u00a02, 3]) in a dry form, and 98% TiO2 was obtained under certain conditions. This demonstrated that the selective chlorination of low-grade titanium ore by TiCl4 under a high oxygen chemical potential is a feasible method of producing high-grade TiO2 directly.",

However, successful remediation of inorganically contaminated sites requires proper knowledge of the contaminants. This paper describes the magnetic and density characteristics of a soil polluted with municipal solid waste incinerator residues, allowing the best separation method or combination of methods for remediating the 0.250\u20131\u00a0mm and the 1\u20132\u00a0mm soil fractions to be selected. Magnetic characterization was performed using a CARPCO high intensity magnetic separator with increasing magnetic fields from 0.04 to 0.7\u00a0Tesla. A second characterization using a factorial design was performed for three magnetic field intensities (0.08 and 0.4 and 0.7\u00a0Tesla) and three relative density fractions (light, intermediate and heavy). The results showed that As, Fe and Sn can be concentrated into the magnetic fraction using low intensity magnetism but not Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn. Moreover, high intensity magnetic separation was not appropriate for concentrating the contaminants present in our soil. The association of the contaminants with iron likely explained this finding, especially for Sn. A significant overlap exists in the removal yields for magnetic and density separation of the different inorganic contaminants, ranging from 29% to 72% depending on the contaminants and the soil fraction. Density separation alone should be preferred to magnetic separation alone because of the better removal efficiency and the lower soil mass in the contaminated fraction afforded by density separation.",

This pH is much lower than that predicted pH from equilibrium data for the formation of these hydrolysis products. Surface induced hydrolysis has been attributed by others as being responsible. The yield stress\u2013pH curve was also shifted to a much higher pH in the presence of Mg(II) and Ca(II). The maximum yield stress of the washed alumina suspension at pH\u00a09.5 was shifted to pH\u00a012 and 13 by Mg(II) and Ca(II) additives respectively. The magnitude of the maximum yield stress in the presence of Mg(II) and Ca(II) appeared to be larger or as large as that without these additives. The species diagrams of Mg(II) and Ca(II) were used to explain change in the zeta potential and yield stress behaviour with pH. Insoluble Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 species are the predominant products at the pH of maximum yield stress. Precipitate bridging was invoked to explain the additional attractive force responsible for the larger maximum yield stress. Steric effect will also be present due to the adsorbed layer. The new phenomena observed here are due to the concentration of Mg(II) and Ca(II) employed, ranging from 0.002 to 0.41\u00a0M, being generally more than an order of magnitude larger than that used in previous studies.",

This synthesis process produces waste alkaline solution as a by-product. To date, research has focused mainly on ZFA synthesis and use; the problematic waste alkaline solution has rarely been addressed. In this study, we developed two composites of zeolite/hydrous iron oxide (ZFA/HIO) and zeolite/hydrous zirconia (ZFA/HZ) by adding, after zeolite synthesis, a step in which waste alkaline solutions are neutralized with an iron or zirconium salt. The composites were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, acid\u2013base neutralizing ability, specific surface area and pore size distribution, and their performance as adsorbents for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from water was investigated. MB adsorption by ZFA/HIO and ZFA/HZ was much higher than that by ZFA, and increased with increasing pH. This behavior was explained by the increased variable charge on the metal oxides. The adsorption was rapid, and nearly complete removal could be achieved at a sufficiently high dose. Material heating resulted in a decrease in pH and adsorption, but heating with pH adjustment could regenerate adsorbents for repeated use in MB removal. Zeolite/hydrous metal oxide synthesis from coal fly ash was environmentally friendly and products exhibit a high potential as reusable adsorbents for MB removal from water.",

A number of hydrolyzable cations, such as Ca2\u00a0+ and Mg2\u00a0+, depress molybdenite in alkaline solutions. Depression of molybdenite in seawater and saline waters is mainly induced by the precipitation of colloidal magnesium hydroxide when pH is raised to depress pyrite.

Depending upon the ore characteristics, in many instances froth flotation has to be used to recover the hematite and other iron oxides from the ground ores. In this context, the difference in silica and alumina content in low grade iron ores is brought to bear on the prospects of iron ore flotation. For this purpose, pure minerals like hematite, quartz, gibbsite, and clay have been used to prepare synthetic mixtures and analyzed to determine the difference in floatability. The results are compared against natural iron ores with variations in silica and alumina content. The flotation results with oleic acid and dodecylamine show better recovery of iron values in the hematite\u2013quartz mixture as well as in the naturally occurring high silica ore compared to the hematite\u2013clay mixture and the high alumina ore respectively. Similarly results on a variety of iron ores show that high silica content as quartz in the ore causes less hindrance in the flotation of iron ore, whereas the presence of silica as clay inhibits the flotation response of iron ore. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies indicate that clay particles cover the surface of hematite, making it less selective for interaction with the collector. The surface potential studies of clay and quartz suggest that charge reversal takes place for quartz treated with dodecylamine (DDA), but for the DDA adsorption on clay, negative potential values are noted beyond a pH of 4.6.",

The complex compositions of WEEE (precious, strategic and rare elements, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, plastics, hazardous substances\u2026) and its often miniature design lead to the technical and environmental difficulties to propose an efficient and viable flow-sheet for WEEE treatment and for the recovery process.In this context, this study deals with delivering a predictive simulation tool (simulator) for the WEEE physical treatment (size reduction and sorting) useful for coherent matter balance calculation. Calculated material flows are then available for further environmental assessment.The simulator approach is based on combining the flow-sheets, the phase model, the mathematical models and a set of algorithms to get a representation of a given situation in terms of material flows circulating between processes. Data optimization and assessment of the simulator output led to the establishment of an enhanced and innovative process for the WEEE processing.Further, this study provides a methodology to assess the impact of the implementation of a WEEE recycling technology that takes into account economic, social and environmental consequences. Results linked to the chosen examples for aluminum and ABS plastic recycling from WEEE by the established process and their use instead of virgin products showed an important profit for these recycled materials from economic and environmental points of view. In this paper, a developed REWARD process was simulated by using a tool based on the USIMPAC\u2122 software architecture.",

As compared to Na, Ca was more easily combined with vanadium generating water-insoluble calcium-bearing vanadate during roasting. The phase distribution calculated by FactSage showed that Ca reacted with quartz and albite to form amorphous phases, resulting in the entrapment of vanadium, thereby decreasing vanadium recovery markedly. In contrast, Fe in stone coal did not affect vanadium recovery as it did not combine with vanadium and not react with other phases during roasting. In order to decrease the negative effects derived from the impurity elements such as Ca, a control measure of concentrating vanadium and reducing impurities treatment was carried out to decrease the dosage of Na2SO4 and improve vanadium recovery.",

The hydrothermal treatments were carried out over the range of 150\u2013225\u00a0\u00b0C for several reaction intervals (1\u20136\u00a0h). The complete conversion of SrSO4 into SrWO4 under non-stirred conditions was found to proceed rapidly on fine SrSO4 particles (<\u00a038\u00a0\u03bcm) by increasing the concentration of the alkaline fluid, and the conversion to SrWO4 was completed at 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h in a 5\u00a0M NaOH solution. The crystallization of the SrWO4 particles occurred rapidly by stirring the autoclave at a speed of 20\u00a0rpm, even when larger SrSO4 particles (165\u00a0\u03bcm) were hydrothermally converted at a low temperature of 150\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. The conversion was further accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature and employing small feedstock particle sizes, <\u00a038 and 69\u00a0\u03bcm. The SrWO4 particles morphology resembled a quasi-octahedral shaped and consisted of fine particles with bimodal sizes between 0.9 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm. A typical tendency toward particle agglomeration was observed during the crystallization of the SrWO4 particles, which after the longest reaction intervals produced agglomerates with a size of 50\u00a0\u03bcm. Bulk dissolution of the mineral SrSO4 powder coupled with a massive precipitation produced the formation of SrWO4 particles. A kinetic analysis was carried out for the conversion of large SrSO4 particles (165\u00a0\u03bcm) into SrWO4 using the diffusion controlled kinetic model proposed by Jander. The activation energy determined for the global conversion process of the quasi-octahedral shaped SrWO4 particles was 18.30\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u2212\u00a01.",

     "abstract": "Iron ore is without doubt one of the most essential commodities of our time. With this, the growing demand from countries, such as China and Japan for iron ore produced in countries, such as Australia and Brazil, is only increasing. Iron Ore Fines (IOF) are a product of iron ore, commonly having a particle size less than 6.3\u00a0mm, which is transported around the world in bulk carriers. Since the holds of bulk carriers are not designed to carry liquid, if liquefaction of IOF or other minerals occurs, it can cause the vessel carrying the cargo to list or even capsize. Since 2006, there have been at least eight reported bulk carrier incidents possibly caused by the iron ore cargo shifting. Currently, the only available parameter used to prevent this from occurring is the Transportable Moisture Limit (TML). The TML is the maximum gross water content that certain mineral cargoes may contain, while being loaded in bulk carriers, without being at risk of liquefying during transportation. The first half of this paper presents a review of the three test methods stated in the 2013 International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (IMSBC Code) and the recently introduced Modified Proctor/Fagerberg test (MPFT). Along with the aforementioned tests, also reviewed are recent developments and advancements made in the field. The second half of this paper presents a comparison of the results of our experimental study with two of the three 2013 IMSBC Code tests along with the MPFT. This study shows that the three test methods which are currently used to determine the TML of minerals are not appropriate for testing of IOF and that the Modified Proctor/Fagerberg test produces a value higher than all the other test methods when used to determine the TML of IOF.",

This is because in its classical form it is one of the simplest models developed for fluid\u2013solid reactions. However, it requires single-sized solid grains failing to describe the leaching kinetics for broad particle size distributions (PSDs). The current investigation successfully applied an extension of the SCM to the leaching of chalcopyrite with a broad PSD in a mixed chloride\u2013sulphate solution. Such a medium was selected because there is renewed attention to leaching in mixed systems due to the increasing utilization of saline waters in both leaching and bioleaching of sulphide ores. Moreover, chloride is a catalyst of chalcopyrite leaching. Specifically, the effects of temperature (70\u00a0\u00b0C to 90\u00a0\u00b0C) and reagent (Fe3+, Cu2+ and Cl\u2212) concentrations on the leaching kinetics were determined.

These mills can consume up to 1% of the gross power generated by the plant; and hence, present a good scope for optimisation. However, optimisation requires better understanding of the operation of these mills and reliable models to be used for investigating optimisation opportunities.A new model of VSMs has been developed which enabled interlinked simulation of comminution and classification operations that occur in the mill. The multi-component models incorporate the effects of size and ash distribution in coal feed, air and coal flow rate and power drawn by the mill. Both models utilise the size-by-size density distribution of the coal streams. An efficiency curve model based on settling velocity was used to describe and distinguish difference in behaviour due to variable density of the components and their composites in the three classification regions. The matrix comminution model works with a selection function that is only dependent on size and a three dimensional breakage function that is size, density and energy dependent to account for the differences in breakage of components and composite particles.It has been demonstrated that, the particle size distributions and flow rates corresponding to the streams in the mill and its product can be estimated with a very good accuracy. A reasonable prediction is also found for the density distributions in these streams.",

     "abstract": "Reverse cationic flotation is a very efficient method of beneficiation of oxidised iron ores when you need to separate hematite and quartz. This method can be also applied to reduce silica content in the magnetite concentrates obtained by wet low-intensity magnetic separation. However, cationic flotation in this case is less effective due to the presence of Fe\u2013Mg\u2013Al-bearing silicates as amphiboles in magnetite ores. These silicates are concentrated in magnetic products and determine the difficulties of their separation from iron oxides when amines and starches are used as collectors and depressants, respectively. The recalculation of the results of the electron microprobe analysis of five calcic Fe\u2013Mg\u2013Al-bearing amphiboles used to characterise cation distributions in structural units and to obtain structural formulae in accord with stoichiometric limits was conducted. The M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy was used to examine the validity of the empirical estimation of cation distributions in amphiboles. The studied samples are metamorphic pargasite, ferrotschermakite and magnesiohornblende and volcanic kaersutite and magnesiohornblende. The crystallographic analyses of the amphibole samples exhibited their heterogeneous surfaces explaining worse floatability of amphiboles with amines at pH\u00a010. The electrokinetic measurements showed that the position of the isoelectric point of amphiboles is related to a substitution of Al3\u00a0+ for Si4\u00a0+ in tetrahedral sites and to an amount of Mg2\u00a0+ cations in octahedral sites. Thus, the amine adsorption onto amphiboles through electrostatic interactions is mainly affected by a distribution of these cations in tetrahedral and octahedral sites of amphiboles. In addition, the effect of starch on the depression of Fe\u2013Mg\u2013Al-bearing amphiboles during flotation can be attributed to the presence of metal ions on the amphibole surface, which are capable of forming strong chemical complexes with starch molecules.",

The kiln feed properties vary with the geological formation from where the mineral is quarried or mined. Characterization of feed properties is necessary to achieve an optimized kiln production. In this work the decomposition of four different types of calcite ore was investigated by comparing conventional constant heating rate and dynamic heating rate thermogravimetric methods.The conclusion of this work is that the conventional method always \u201covershoots\u201d the calcination temperature when continuously heating during calcination compared to the dynamic rate method that resembles the kiln by holding temperatures constant during the calcination event. This justifies the used of the dynamic rate method. By a correct experimental parameter setup the dynamic rate method can be adapted for individual kilns and feed fractions, giving new additional value to the kiln operator and increasing the high value use of limestone deposits. This new method to characterize calcination properties of kiln feed materials can be utilized in normal kiln operations and when developing new mixes of different quality limestone. The results show differences when comparing the methods and different materials even though CaCO3 is present only as calcite. In addition, the dynamic rate method is faster than the conventional method. Besides quicklime production the method can also be applied in other industries calcining limestone, such as cement clinker production.",

Data on the kinetics of the reaction of NH4F\u00b7xHF with plasma-dissociated zircon, combined with the thermodynamic parameters, are essential for the development of an industrial process for the production of a precursor for the manufacture of zirconium metal, viz. anhydrous ZrF4. The reaction yields (NH4)3ZrF7(s) and (NH4)2SiF6(s), the latter forming volatile products at relatively low temperatures, affording easy separation of silicon from the zirconium compound. Another useful aspect of the process is the possibility of recycling, since the ammonia and hydrogen fluoride in the waste stream can be recombined, making them available for re-use as the acid fluoride. It was found that the reaction constant k\u2033 varies exponentially with temperature at a set value of x, but linearly with changes in x at a set temperature.

     "abstract": "The steady-state data reconciliation of mineral processing plants has traditionally depended on chemical assays of samples collected from various streams in the plant. In some cases, additional information in the form of size assays and size-wise chemical assays have been employed to improve the reconciliation problem. Reconciliation algorithms, in addition to making the measured data consistent with the basic conservation principles, also help in predicting the material flow rates in different streams. This information helps the process engineer to identify and troubleshoot problem areas, and further use it to optimize the plant's performance. If all the minerals present in the ore system are known (established through X-Ray Diffraction), the chemical formulae of the minerals provide the relationship between the chemical assays and mineral composition. In this communication, first we propose an approach to estimate the mineral composition from the measured chemical assays for a given sample or stream. It is then extended to a plant-wide concurrent data reconciliation methodology, involving both the chemical assays and mineral composition. This concurrent data reconciliation procedure provides estimates of mineral composition around the plant even when mineral composition measurements are not available. This additional information will help the plant engineers to track and improve their plant's behavior more intuitively. When mineral compositions are measured (for example, through QEMSCAN) they can be reconciled along with chemical assays. The methodology is demonstrated with data from batch and semi-batch laboratory studies on selective dispersion-flocculation of iron ore slimes.",

     "abstract": "Sphalerite flotation and separation from other sulphide minerals are strongly dependent on pulp solution conditions such as pH and copper concentration but also temperature. The surface of sphalerite needs to be activated with copper ions to enable collector adsorption and therefore sphalerite flotation. It was found that the collectorless flotation recovery and rate of sphalerite increased with increasing copper concentration up to a maximum value before decreasing with further copper addition independently of temperature. This increase in recovery is attributed to the copper-activation of sphalerite with formation of the hydrophobic species of polysulphide/elemental sulphur. Several complementary solution and surface analytical studies have shown that the maximum recovery corresponds to the maximum number of surface zinc ions that can be replaced with copper ions (copper-activation mechanism). The decrease in recovery is not the result of further adsorption of copper hydroxide in molecular form at the sphalerite surface but it is attributed to copper hydroxide precipitation covering the hydrophobic surface species. Addition of xanthate collector restores the flotation recovery and rate of copper-activated sphalerite. It was also found that the flotation recovery and rate of copper-activated sphalerite at pH\u00a010.5 are reduced when temperature is below 12\u00a0\u00b0C in the absence or presence of collector, which is in good agreement with observations made at several flotation plants that zinc recovery is on average less during winter than in summer.

     "abstract": "In this paper, a systematic study was conducted to investigate the influence of calcination conditions including grinding time of raw material, temperature, holding time and heating rate on the pozzolanic activity of calcined coal gangue (abbreviated as CCG hereinafter). Furthermore, the changes of mineral composition, chemical structure and morphology of coal gangue during calcination were characterized by means of thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimeter (TG-DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses. The results show that heating temperature affects directly the mineralogy and crystallinity of CCG. Kaolinite in coal gangue transforms into metakaolin which is an irregular and amorphous phase as calcined at 600\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013800\u00a0\u00b0C because of the dehydroxylation of Al\u2013(O,OH) octahedrons together with the depolymerization of Si\u2013O tetrahedrons. The amorphous metakaolin is of high pozzolanic activity; however, it will lose its activity due to the recrystallization into mullite when heating temperature is over 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. The pozzolanic activity of CCG is mainly dependent on the non-crystallizing degree of kaolinite after calcination.",

     "abstract": "With high-grade ilmenite (FeTiO3) ores becoming scarce, there is a need to process lower-grade and more weathered ilmenite ores. These alternative sources provide complexities in terms of physical characteristics, mineral compositions, and impurity levels, all of which can significantly affect the subsequent processing route. In the production of high purity white pigment from ilmenite, chromia (Cr2O3)-containing impurities such as chrome-rich spinels need to be removed from the ilmenite concentrates down to commercially accepted levels. Existing magnetising roast processes currently used in the industry do not allow a clean separation of the chrome-rich spinels from the ilmenite due to overlapping physical properties. It has been suggested that selective sulfidation of chrome-rich spinels could be a potential route for chromia separation from ilmenite. However, the detailed conditions under which the selective sulfidation can occur are not well known. This work focuses on a systematic study of selective sulfidation of chromite FeCr2O4 (one end member of the spinel series) for the purpose of chromia impurity removal from a weathered ilmenite concentrate. Detailed thermodynamic assessment and experimental studies have been carried out to determine the conditions at which selective chrome spinel sulfidation occurs. The results suggest that there are two regimes (Area-1 and Area-2) where selective chrome spinel sulfidation is possible. Area-1 is in the range of pO2\u00a0\u2248\u00a02.37\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a009\u00a0atm to 5.01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a015\u00a0atm, while Area-2 is at lower pO2 (\u2264\u00a06.92\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a019\u00a0atm) and pS2 (\u2264\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a006\u00a0atm) region relative to Area-1. Targeted experimental analyses of the two regimes revealed that selective sulfidation of chrome spinel occur only under the reaction conditions at Area-2. It is suggested that the lack of selective chrome spinel sulfidation under Area-1 conditions is the change in activity of iron (aFe) due to weathering action on chrome spinel grain.",

     "abstract": "We investigated the influence of a salt solution on the flotation behaviour of synthetic malachite using a sodium oleate as a collector. We found that the floatability of oleate ions-adsorbed synthetic malachite monotonically increases with an increase in the overall ionic strength (IS) range (1\u20131000\u00a0mM) of the monovalent cation (Na+), while the floatability sharply increases only up to a level of 30\u00a0mM of the divalent cation (Ca2\u00a0+), followed by decreased floatability with further increases in the IS. For a monovalent salt, Na+ ions effectively screen a negatively charged bubble surface, reducing the energy barrier for attachment and thus increasing floatability. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility measurements revealed that oleate ions-adsorbed synthetic malachite is negatively charged in a NaCl solution while it is positively charged in a CaCl2 solution over the entire IS, indicating the specific adsorption of Ca2\u00a0+ ions onto the surface of oleate ions-adsorbed synthetic malachite in a CaCl2 solution. This surface charge reversal in the CaCl2 solution suggests that electrostatic interaction between positively charged oleate ions-adsorbed synthetic malachite and a negatively charged bubble is attractive, yielding high flotation efficiency. The increased floatability of both the entire IS of NaCl and a low IS of CaCl2 can be well explained by the extended DLVO theory. At a high IS (100\u20131000\u00a0mM) of CaCl2, however, the decreased floatability did not follow the extended DLVO prediction, implying that additional non-DLVO type interactions are likely to be involved. Direct contact angle measurements and an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis with the electrophoretic mobility measurements revealed that this unusual flotation behaviour is likely due to the hydration layer by the hydrated Ca2\u00a0+ adsorption onto oleate ions-adsorbed synthetic malachite.",

     "abstract": "Ball milling has been the subject of intensive research for the past few decades. It is indeed the most encountered mineral processing operation of size reduction. Known as the most energy inefficient process, focus has mainly been on ways of reducing the energy consumption incurred by the operation. There are programs for the computer design of mineral processing circuits, and these programs contain computer simulation models for ball mill design. These models need the input of characteristic breakage parameters for the mineral of interest and these are often determined in a small size laboratory ball mill and scaled up by the program to the conditions of a full-scale ball mill. Models and simulators have been used for plant technical analysis since 1970. Some of these models and simulators were developed for mineral processing operations, whereas some were dedicated to mineral processing operations. The prominent work for the mineral processing applications includes JKSimMet, MODSIM\u00a9 and its derivatives.A neural network is able to learn complex relationships between related variables and therefore has been widely used as a tool for process modeling. It consists of many simple parallel processing units (called \u201cneurons\u201d), which can resemble the architecture of the human brain, and thus is capable of learning arbitrary nonlinear mappings between noisy sets of input and output factors.The grindability properties of the calcite sample belonging to the Mu\u011fla region were investigated at batch grinding conditions based on a kinetic model. The obtained kinetic model parameters were used to estimate the product size distribution by artificial neural networks (ANN). Then, the experimental and neural network prediction results were compared.",

     "abstract": "A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to investigate the influence of solid concentration on bubbles' coalescence rate in flotation cell using Eulerian\u2013Eulerian approach. CFD simulations were performed with AVL-FIRE 2009.2, and the existing flow field was modelled for two-phase (gas\u2013liquid) and three-phase (gas\u2013liquid\u2013solids). The liquid phase was treated as a continuum and the gas phase (bubbles) and solid particles were considered as dispersed phases. The population balance equation for bubble break-up and bubble coalescence rate and the interfacial exchange of mass and momentum as well as bubble\u2013particle attachment and detachment have been included in the CFD code by writing subroutines in FORTRAN. This investigation focused on studying the effect of solid particle on bubble break-up and bubble coalescence rate in the flotation cell at different superficial gas velocity values. The results predict that the presence of solid particles reduced the gas holdup in a flotation column. With the increase of the superficial gas velocity the size of gas bubble that were generated inside the cell decreased, leading to increased gas holdup. The result also shows that the Sauter mean diameter of bubbles decreases with the increase of solid concentration. Reasonably good agreement was obtained between simulation and experimental results for the effect of solid concentration on gas hold-up and axial pressure profile. In the current study, the froth zone was neglected, only the pulp zone was simulated. This is a deficiency of the present model, as the pulp is only one part of the flotation process, and it is physically linked to the froth. However, the model is a step towards gaining a complete view to describing the processes within a flotation cell through inspect the impact of presence of solid particles on the bubble coalescence rate under the different operation conditions.",

The turbidity in the AMD samples with 90\u00a0s rapid mixing is slightly higher than in the samples with 30 and 60 rapid mixing. The SEM image of the sample with 90\u00a0s rapid mixing showed scattered agglomerates which indicates that rupturing occurred.

The increase in reduction time facilitated the generation of metallic iron and the grain growth of the metallic phase in the reduced briquettes, which had a beneficial effect on the separation of iron and boron in the subsequent low-intensity magnetic separation process.

     "abstract": "Different flotation strategies are used to concentrate apatite from phosphate rock around the world. There is evidence that the flotation performance of apatite can be influenced by its dissolution kinetics. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dissolution kinetics parameters on the flotation response, with sodium oleate, of apatite samples from different origins and genesis. The samples were firstly purified and characterized by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and the Rietveld method applied to X-Ray Diffraction data (RXD). Surface area, specific mass and porosity were also determined. Apatite dissolution experiments were carried out in an automated reactor. The apatite flotation responses were determined by means of microflotation experiments. Both types of tests were performed at pH\u00a08 and 10. By means of exponential adjustment of the dissolution curves (accumulated amount of dissolved Ca2\u00a0+ ions as a function of time) it was possible to calculate the maximum amount of dissolved Ca2\u00a0+ ions (Ca2\u00a0+MAX) and the kinetic constant (k). The initial dissolution rate (Ri) was determined by linear adjustment of the first minutes of reaction. It was observed that the initial dissolution rate, as well as the floatability, is greater at pH\u00a08 than at pH\u00a010. In addition, by comparing apatites from different origins it was found that the floatability increases with Ri and Ca2\u00a0+MAX. The results indicate that the flotation performance is improved by the increase in the amount of Ca2\u00a0+ ions that are available to interact with oleate molecules. This result supports the relevance of the surface precipitation mechanism governing the adsorption of oleate on the apatite surface.",

     "abstract": "Gas dispersion properties play an important role in flotation as they partially determine the metallurgical performance. The objective of this work is to obtain a dynamic model of the bubble size distribution in a two-phase (air and water) pilot flotation column. The steps are: 1) to measure and count the bubbles from digital images taken by a camera, 2) to estimate a log\u2013normal distribution of the bubble sizes, 3) to estimate a Wiener model whose outputs are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution while the inputs are the superficial gas velocity set-point and the superficial shearing water velocity set-point. The size and number of bubbles in each image are evaluated by a bubble detection technique based on circular Hough transform (CHT). This technique allows overcoming issues related to the detection of large single bubbles as well as clusters. Tests are carried out in the laboratory flotation column using different concentrations of frother and air flow rates. Results are compared with visual counting, as well as with a commonly used bubble detection method based on circular particle detection (CPD). The estimated number of bubbles is very similar to what is obtained with a visual count. Compared to CPD algorithm, CHT significantly improves D32 estimation (error of 3% instead of 18% with the former) with a comparable processing time. Then, the mean and standard deviation of a log\u2013normal distribution are estimated by maximizing a likelihood function thereby leading to very good fits for the distributions. Finally, a series of model identification tests are conducted by manipulating the superficial gas velocity set-point and the superficial shearing water velocity set-point (i.e. air and shearing water flow rate set-points through the sparger). A Wiener model is then estimated to predict the corresponding mean and standard deviation of the log\u2013normal distribution. Validation tests confirm the quality of the non-linear model.",

Cluster formation from kaolinite suspensions was found at low pH (pH\u00a05); in contrast, kaolinite particles were well dispersed at high pH (pH\u00a08). This distinguishing feature is mainly due to the anisotropic surface properties of kaolinite particles and their pH dependence. At pH\u00a05, the particles are aggregated by attraction between the negative silica face surface and the positive alumina face surface, as well as by the interaction between the negative edge surface and the positive alumina face surface. However, at pH\u00a08, all the surfaces are negatively charged, resulting in a well dispersed kaolinite suspension.

In addition to these experimental results, fresh sphalerite-ZnS (110), copper-zinc sulfide-CuZnS2 (110), villamaninite-CuS2 (100), and covellite-CuS (001) surfaces were examined using Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS). Our MDS results on the behavior of interfacial water at the fresh sphalerite-ZnS (110), copper-zinc sulfide-CuZnS2 (110), villamaninite-CuS2 (100), and covellite-CuS (001) surfaces include simulated contact angles, water number density distribution, water dipole orientation, water residence time, and hydrogen-bonding considerations. The copper content at the Cu2\u00a0+ activated sphalerite surface seems to account for the increased hydrophobicity as revealed by both experimental and MD simulated contact angle measurements. The relatively greater hydrophobic character developed at the Cu2\u00a0+ activated sphalerite surface and at the copper sulfide surfaces has been described by MDS, based on the structure of interfacial water and its dynamic properties.",

     "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries are widely used as a power source for portable equipment. In the present work a sample of batteries was submitted to a series of mechanical processes to recover cobalt, copper and aluminum. The initial milling process promoted a previous particle distribution of the metal content fractions. Each of these fractions underwent to the most suitable recovery process according to their composition, especially regarding the presence of copper and magnetic metals such as iron and cobalt. The magnetic separation was efficient for particle sizes from 1\u00a0mm to 2\u00a0mm, resulting in a concentrate with up to 54% copper. The gravimetric separation with a Wilfley table, performed on the fraction with lower concentration of magnetic metals, resulted in a concentrate with up to 66% copper. Cobalt is found mainly in the fine material with particle sizes smaller than 1\u00a0mm. Quantitative chemical analysis has shown promising results when the concentrate is leached, with the cobalt concentration corresponding to 80% of the dissolved elements. The results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain rich concentrates of cobalt and copper through mechanical processing of lithium-ion batteries, and that it is feasible to concentrate aluminum as a by-product by applying additional mechanical processes.",

The flotation column was constructed based on the calculated value of column diameter and required values of above-mentioned variables. Residence time distribution (RTD) of the liquid phase was measured for the column using the tracer impulse response method. Vessel dispersion number (Nd) was measured from the RTD statistics equal to 0.32, which was completely similar to its required value.

Good regulation of the interface level between the bitumen froth and the middlings in these cells can result in a significant improvement in bitumen recovery and throughput and heavily influence process economics. This paper details a case study application of identification and design of a model based predictive controller for the separation cell process. Internal model control (IMC) and model predictive control (MPC) schemes using linear models are designed and implemented in real time on the industrial separation cell. The industrial implementation result shows that both IMC and MPC schemes provide significant benefits over the current operations which use a PID controller. The benefits include significant reduction in the variance of the interface level and underflow pump movement, resulting in higher bitumen recovery, smoother operations downstream and pump energy savings.",

PGM recovery from spent catalysts is a challenge due to the fact that spent catalysts are diverse and complex in terms of material and component makeup as well as the original catalyst's manufacturing processes. The state of the art recovery of PGMs from spent catalysts by pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy techniques is highlighted and existing advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are analyzed in this paper.

     "abstract": "The rare earth elements (REE) are essential for a wide range of applications, from strategic assets (e.g. petroleum cracking, magnets for wind turbines) to popular merchandise, as smartphones. Since 2010, when China, the worlds close to exclusive REE supplier, imposed export quotas, several old and new deposits have been evaluated to compensate market shortage, taking advantage of significant price rises. The Arax\u00e1 rare earth elements prospect boast a large reserve (6.34\u00a0Mt @ 5.01% REO), as well as phosphate and niobium, in a deeply weathered ore of carbonatitic origin. The mineralogy and the ore properties are unconventional for rare earth elements, and require a detailed mineralogical and technological characterisation as starting point to develop a feasible processing route.Rare earths are predominantly carried by monazite (over 70%), and by a solid solution of the plumbogummite group minerals where the barium-rich term gorceixite predominates, while cerianite and bastnaesite account for less than 1% each. Minerals of the pyrochlore supergroup are the main Nb carriers, but phosphate is also due to monazite and the plumbogummite group minerals, as apatite has barely been detected. Goethite, high-Al hematite and quartz are the main gangue minerals, and goethite is thoroughly intergrown with the other phases. Fine particle size (P50 close to 45\u00a0\u03bcm) and 47.4% of the REE in the \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcm size fraction is another feature typical of this kind of ore. The mineralogical and textural complexity of the ore required a comprehensive technological characterisation in order to evaluate processing options.Based on textural measurements, the concentration of monazite, the concentration of the REE carrying minerals and the reverse removal of quartz, as processing option for this ore, have been simulated.Incomplete liberation of monazite does limit its grade in an ideal concentrate to 80%, and its recovery to 70%. The low monazite recovery must be added to the loss of REE carried by other phases, reducing the overall REE recovery to below 45%. Monazite has also a very limited exposition of the mineral on the particle's surfaces, supposed to impair process efficiency enough to keep experimental results significantly far from the simulated ones.The concentration of the REE-bearing minerals might be efficient from the liberation point of view, and over 90% of the REE carriers can be recovered to a 97% grade concentrate. Due to the low REE grade of predominant gorceixite (3.3%), however, the concentrate's grade of 14% REE is just slightly above the double of the ore's grade. For the REE-bearing minerals taken together, the process efficiency might be hampered by selectivity due to the complex mineralogy.The major gangue minerals, goethite and hematite, are strongly intergrown with the other minerals of the assemblage, to an extent that evaluating reverse processing considering these phases was not feasible. The removal of quartz by reverse processing is quite straightforward, and 95% of the mineral might be removed to a high-grade quartz concentrate of 93%, with loss of REE of only 0.14%. The mass discharge of 8.7%, however, rises the grade of the concentrate only to 7.3% REE.Complex mineralogy and the fine crystals and particles with strong intergrowth that characterise the ore hamper efficient concentration for the Arax\u00e1 REE ore, and direct hydrometallurgical processing of the whole was adopted. The results are in agreement with the few other published attempts to concentrate the rare earth minerals from residual lateritic ores related to carbonatites.",

These electrodes are formed from electrode paste that is baked during operation into solid carbonaceous and ultimately graphite electrodes. Coal tar pitch (CTP) is used as a binder in the electrode paste. In order to ensure the production of quality electrode paste, CTP is analysed for softening point (SP), coking value (CV), as well as toluene- (TI) and quinoline insoluble (QI) contents, together with proximate analysis for the determination of fixed carbon, volatile, ash and moisture contents. Ultimate analyses for the determination of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen contents are also performed. However, the TI and QI content analyses are time consuming and harmful solvents are used. In this paper it was proven that multi-linear regression (MLR) analysis can be used to derive equations to calculate TI and QI from other parameters, i.e. SP, CV, as well as proximate and ultimate analyses. Root mean square error differences between MLR calculated TI and QI contents for 12 CTP samples sourced from suppliers throughout the world were found to be approximately 0.36 and 0.32, respectively. Although it is not foreseen that calculation of these two parameters will replace experimental determinations, the MLR equations determined in this study can be used by CTP producers and consumers as proxies for TI and QI. This will reduce the use of harmful solvents and the frequency required to conduct time consuming experimental determinations for TI and QI.",

A strong improvement in the floatability of hydrophobic bituminous coals and other inherently hydrophobic minerals is characteristic for the \u201csalt flotation process\u201d, which is carried out in concentrated electrolyte solutions at natural pH and without addition of any flotation reagents. However, pH is a key factor when saline waters with hydrolyzing metallic ions are used as a process water.

The process waters with a high content of Mg2\u00a0+ and Ca2\u00a0+ ions, and this also includes seawater, have deleterious effect on the anionic flotation of industrial minerals with fatty acids due to the precipitation of Ca/Mg fatty acid salts.

     "abstract": "Estimation of rock composition in mining plants is important for determining rock size and grindability which, in turn, may improve control of the grinding process. Variations in ore grindability and size distribution directly affect a mill's power consumption and throughput. It is therefore highly desirable to develop new methods to estimate rock lithological composition remotely. In this paper, a new method for remote lithological classification based on digital image analysis is proposed. The method is based on a single digital video camera for image acquisition from rocks on a conveyor belt. Each image is broken into sub-images to extract texture information using several different spatial scales. Gabor filters are used to extract features from each sub-image for five different spatial scales and eight orientations. After feature extraction, each sub-image is classified into a lithological class using a support-vector machine (SVM). Finally, information from the contour of each rock is used to select all sub-images that fall inside the contour and vote for the rock class. The method was tested on three databases, one of them containing sub-images of 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a043\u00a0pixels of five ore types assigned to three grindability classes (soft, medium and hard). The second database has seven ore types containing sub-images of 60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040\u00a0pixels. The third database was captured with higher resolution cameras and controlled illumination with five ore types and containing sub-images of 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a048. The databases were divided into 2 subsets, one for training with cross validation, and the other for testing. Classification accuracy was compared with previously published results on both databases. Comparisons show that our proposed method yielded significant improvements in classification accuracy, between 8.3% and 26%, relative to previously published results.",

In this research, the end-wall effect was investigated by gradually increasing the model mill length and analysing the charge trajectory and shape variation at given operating conditions (i.e., ball filling, mill speed, liner type). The special design of the model mill with the diameter of 100\u00a0cm made it possible to increase the mill length in steps of 3.6\u00a0cm up to 21.6\u00a0cm. Four types of liners, five steel ball fillings (10, 15, 20, 25, 30% v/v) and three mill speeds (55, 70, 85% of critical speed) were tested. The results indicated that when the mill length was below 10.8\u00a0cm the end-walls prevented the charge from free falling. This resulted in lower impact point angles and lower power draws compared with the case of no end-wall effect. When the same experiments were performed using an iron ore instead of balls with the same size range, the impact of end-wall effect was more pronounced. For a mill length of 3.6\u00a0cm, an increase of 30% in the speed (from 55 to 85%) with the iron ore charge, the torque decreased by 41% (from 3.7 to 2.2\u00a0kgf\u00b7m) when mill filling was 30%. At the same operating conditions, when steel balls were used the torque decreased only by 19% (from 9 to 7.2\u00a0kgf\u00b7m). Three-dimensional DEM simulations also resulted in similar conclusions.",

Such studies, however, have very rarely involved real mineral sulfides and flotation collectors to date. Here, the tapping mode AFM, force spectroscopy with conventional silicon cantilevers, and ex situ XPS were used to characterize surfaces of single crystals of natural PbS and, for comparison, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in pure water before and after their pre-treatment in 0.1\u00a0mM and 10\u00a0mM potassium n-butyl xanthate (KBX) solutions. Submicrometer domains with the height about 3\u20138\u00a0nm were observed on the PbS surfaces with chemisorbed xanthate. The force\u2013distance curves measured upon retraction of the tip from PbS and HOPG surfaces pre-treated in KBX solutions revealed the attraction forces, often with two sudden pull-off steps, acting at the separation distances longer than 100\u00a0nm. We attributed the soft domains to gas nanobubbles; the long-range attraction was explained in terms of the capillary forces induced by a vapor cavity arising between the tip and the hydrophobic substrates upon their disconnection, and coalescence of the cavity with the pre-existing nanobubbles. The role of these phenomena in flotation is briefly discussed.",

BOS sludge was used to treat Wheal Jane mine (Cornwall, UK) AMD in this work. Batch experiments were conducted as function of initial solution pH, adsorbent loading, regeneration and thermal treatment to study the performance of BOS sludge in removing manganese, copper, iron, and zinc.Kinetic studies indicated that the rate of adsorption of the heavy metals by BOS sludge was rapid. A high pH promoted adsorption and removal of the heavy metal ions was not only due to ion exchange or adsorption but also partly due to co-precipitation effect. The treatment of Wheal Jane mine AMD demonstrated that about 100% of Cu and Fe, 97% of Zn and 94% of Mn were removed from solution. The results show that BOS sludge has great potential as an alternative material in the treatment of real waste water streams. Thus BOS sludge could be used as a sustainable sorbent for the more expensive materials in AMD treatment technologies due to its adsorptive properties, high availability, large quantities and low cost.",

An ultra-centrifugal mill with a peripheral comminuting path was used as activator in the experiment. A mathematical model based on the theoretical principles of the grain mixture mechanical processing was applied in order to characterize the phosphate activation procedure. As the energy conversion that takes place by the interaction mill\u2013material during activation is recorded on the processed phosphate grains, the increase in potential energy of the activated grains was measured by means of an automatic grain counter. Following the operating hypothesis of the automatic grain counter, the energy conversion and the properties of phosphate grains induced by mechanical force were monitored and expressed in the form of the grain inertia change. The phosphate ore grain mixture used in the experiment was thoroughly analyzed, particularly in its activated state. Analytically obtained results were supported by X-ray diffraction analysis for identification of crystalline phases and change in crystallinity, and SEM microphotography of initial and activated phosphate grains. Diverse comparison analyses disclosed that the optimal set of activation process parameters could reduce the negative effect of phosphate sample immanent properties on the final score and furthermore enhance the material reactivity.",

The uncertainties are represented by normal, uniform and triangular probability distribution functions (PDFs). The case studies include the uncertainty in the recovery of each stage separately and simultaneously across all of the stages with different standard deviation levels. A total of 2880 cases were studied, which corresponded with twelve circuits, three distribution functions and 84 different combinations with standard deviations in the stage recoveries. For each case, 2000 simulations were performed, with an overall simulation total of 5.76 million. Among the conclusions obtained in this work are the following: 1) The shape of the distribution function in the output variables is dependent on the input distribution function, the concentration circuit and the uncertainty level; 2) when the recovery of a single stage is represented by a PDF, the other stage recoveries are assigned a deterministic value then the type of the PDF obtained for the global recovery is similar to the input distribution; 3) when considering uncertainty in several stages simultaneously, the resulting PDF type usually is not the same PDF type observed for the input variables; and 4) the circuit structure affects more than the stage recoveries in the analysis of the global recovery and concentrate grade.",

A central composite design (CCD) was used to investigate the effects of three independent variables (namely proportion (m/m, reagent/material), roasting temperature (\u00b0C) and holding time (min)) on the leaching rate of palladium and rhodium. The independent variables were coded at three levels and their actual values based on experimental results. The CCD consisted of 20 experimental points and six replications at the center point. Data were analyzed using design expert and statistical analysis system software. A second-order polynomial model was used for predicting the response. The model explained 53% more variation. Canonical analysis of surface responses shows that the stationary surface was a saddle. The optimal conditions for the leaching rate of palladium and rhodium obtained using ridge analysis were 9.75, 550\u00a0\u00b0C, 60\u00a0min; 9.00, 540\u00a0\u00b0C, 50\u00a0min; and 9.96, 550\u00a0\u00b0C, 53.84\u00a0min, respectively. The predicted leaching rate of palladium is more than 99.29% and the predicted leaching rate of rhodium is more than 95.34% under three optimum conditions. In order to obtain the highest leaching rate, the conditions for the extraction of palladium and rhodium were tuned to 10, 550\u00a0\u00b0C, 60\u00a0min. The actual leaching rates of palladium and rhodium were 99.33% and 95.48% at the tuned conditions, which are very similar to those predicted by RSM models.",

     "publication date": "10-2015",
     "abstract": "The beneficiation of phosphate ores by froth flotation is the most efficient process used to separate apatite from calcium minerals. However, the similarity of surface properties between apatite and calcite generally leads to non-selective adsorption of reagents, rendering the selective separation of these minerals a problem, demanding a specific approach. The sedimentary phosphate deposit of Itataia, Brazil, studied in this paper, presents a complex mineralogical composition. The bulk flotation of apatite and calcite with anionic collectors in an alkaline medium followed by selective flotation of calcite at pH\u00a05.5 using phosphoric acid or citric acid as depressant has been suggested for this ore. In the present work, contact angle measurements were performed to evaluate the behavior of jojoba oil as an alternative collector for the selective separation of apatite and calcite minerals. Jojoba oil is composed mainly of gondoic, erucic and oleic acids. The hydrophobicity studies were undertaken using a computer controlled contact angle goniometer. Additionally, the collector adsorption was evaluated through electrophoretic mobility and FTIR measurements. The results indicated that a high selectivity between calcite and apatite can be obtained by using jojoba oil as a collector at slightly acid medium, without the use of depressants. The most interesting results were achieved with a jojoba oil concentration of 200\u00a0mg\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01 at pH\u00a06.5, where the apatite was fully hydrophilic while calcite showed high hydrophobicity.",

Flotation tests were carried out using single collectors as well as various mixtures of the two collectors at different but constant total molar concentrations. Flotation performances were increased effectively by the combination of collectors. The findings show that a higher copper recovery (84.82%) was obtained when using a 40:160\u00a0g/t mixture of sodium iso-propyl xanthate (SIPX) with di-ethyl dithiophosphate compared to 78.11% with the best single collector. Similar recovery improvement (83.07%) was also observed by using a 160:40\u00a0g/t mixture of sodium iso-propyl xanthate (SIPX) with alkyl hydroxamate. The results indicate that in both cases DTP and alkyl hydroxamate played important role as co-collector with SIPX for the recovery of coarse interlocked copper bearing particles and has an important effect on the behaviour of the froth phase. However, comparatively higher mass recovery was obtained when hydroxamate was used as a co-collector, accompanied by poorer copper grades. In this context the co-collector DTP is advantageous for the improvement of copper grade and recovery from copper smelter slag.",

In this study, the behavior of phosphorus during the carbothermic reduction of a phosphorus-rich oolitic hematite ore in the absence or presence of Na2SO4 was characterized. Thermodynamic calculations of the reactions of fluorapatite with SiO2, Al2O3, or Na2SO4, phase transformations during reduction and the distributing characteristics of phosphorus in the metallic iron and non-metallic phases of the reduced pellets were investigated. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that SiO2, Al2O3, and Na2SO4 influence the reduction of fluorapatite significantly. XRD and SEM-EDS results confirm that when the oolitic hematite ore was reduced in the presence of Na2SO4, reactions between Na2SO4, SiO2, and Al2O3 are prior to the reduction of fluorapatite. Therefore, the phosphorus content of the metallic iron phase in the pellet decreased markedly. With the sodium sulfate dosage varying from 0% to 20%, the mean phosphorus mass content in metallic iron grains decreased from 0.877% to 0.02%. The dephosphorized iron is then recovered by magnetic separation subsequently.",

In this research, the effects of the galena and sphalerite flotation reagents on the activity of mesophilic bacteria were investigated. The bioleaching experiments were carried out using three microbial species including Acidithiobacillus Ferrooxidans (AF), Acidithiobacillus Thiooxidans (AT), Leptosprillum Ferrooxidans (LF), and also the mixed culture of these mesophilic microorganisms. The flotation reagents were used exactly in similar concentrations and in the same way as applied in the industrial lead-zinc flotation plants. Moreover, the effects of two xanthate collectors of potassium ethyl xanthate (KEX) and potassium amyl xanthate (KAX) were separately studied on the bioleaching of zinc sulphide by AF bacteria. The zinc dissolution rate under bioleaching process was increased due to the cumulative effects of the flotation reagents at the concentration ranges needed to float both galena and sphalerite minerals. However, such a positive effects of the reagents was more pronounced on the mixed-culture of bacteria compared to that of single species. The maximum zinc extraction was 97% after 30\u00a0days using the mixed-culture bacteria in the presence of chemical flotation reagents while it was only 74% in the absence of the flotation reagents. It should be noted that the corresponding percentages of zinc extraction for AF bacteria were 86% and 64% and for the LF bacteria were 70% and 61%, respectively. An increase in the bioleaching rate was also observed when the KAX collector was added into the solid sample instead of adding to the solution of cell culture media.

     "abstract": "We study the effects of the growth phase of Rhodococcus opacus on the floatability of malachite. We find that bacteria in stationary phase show more than two-fold higher floatability than bacteria in mid-exponential phase. To understand the mechanism of this higher floatability for the stationary phase, we examine bacteria surface properties such as zeta potential and contact angle. Surprisingly, all bacteria surface properties are nearly the same; moreover, the amounts of bacteria adsorbed onto malachite are also identical. Despite bacteria's similar surface properties, we discover that the amount of bacteria detached from malachite during the mixing process in flotation is larger for the mid-exponential phase than for the stationary phase. We attribute this to hydrodynamic shear stress due to the fluid flow established in mineral mixing. Furthermore, we observe that bacteria\u2013bacteria interactions are far more significant for the mid-exponential phase, leading to end-to-end aggregation and thus allowing unique loosely-packed structures on the malachite surface to form. Such loose structures of bacteria on the mineral are highly susceptible to fluid flow and can be easily detached from the mineral surface. Our findings suggest that due to the relatively large size of the bacteria, it is crucial to consider the detachment of adhered bacteria on the mineral surface due to fluid flow during mixing, which is easily ignored in typical flotation processes.",

     "abstract": "The current work aims at the recovery of residual copper from electrical cables with low content of copper (less than 5%). The sample originated from the tailings of electrical cables that had been previously subjected to copper recycling treatment. The tailings were successively treated with physical methods (sieving, heavy medium separation in ZnCl2 bath, and counter-current separation) and electrochemical methods (cementation, electrowinning). Sieving seems to be more efficient than gravity separation methods, since, for 1.00\u00a0mm aperture and sieving time as short as 2\u00a0min, the undersize copper grade of the product was 57% in copper (from 4% in the feed), with corresponding copper recovery of 53%. Longer sieving times or larger apertures led to products with higher copper recovery but of lower grade. As regards cementation, preliminary tests were carried out to investigate the effect of pH using high purity CuSO4\u00a0\u00b7\u00a05H2O instead of dissolving metallic copper. Subsequent tests using the sieving undersize product of the scrap copper wire confirmed the results of the preliminary tests; in addition to pH, this product was also used to investigate the effects of the attacking chemical (H2SO4, HCl, H2O2), sacrificial metal (aluminium, iron scrap), temperature, and surface area on cementation. The results show that cementation of the dissolved copper from scrap wire is efficient at pH\u00a0=\u00a02.5\u20133.2, with sufficient copper recovery within a few hours. Also, electrowinning tests on the undersize sieving product proved the feasibility to obtain pure copper by electrodeposition onto stainless steel cathode with lead anode, without contamination of the electrolytic solution. In both methods, copper purity degrades when HCl acid is used instead of H2SO4. Especially with the use of H2SO4 in electrowinning, it was observed that lead anode is passivated when the solution is entirely depleted from copper ions. The results of the current work clearly demonstrate the feasibility to obtain pure copper from low-grade electric wire scraps by successively submitting the tailings to sieving and cementation.",

     "abstract": "In this study, flotation and adsorption of cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC), a novel cationic collector for molybdite and fluorapatite, were comparatively investigated by flotation tests, zeta potential measurements, adsorption tests and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis. The flotation results demonstrated a large difference in molybdite and fluorapatite recovery, from 33.5% at pH\u00a02 to 40.7% at 8, showing a possibility for the separation of molybdite from fluorapatite in the range of pH\u00a02\u20138. A higher amount of adsorbed CPC on molybdite than on fluorapatite was dramatically revealed by Zeta potential measurements as well as adsorption tests, which can explain the better floatability of molybdite than fluorapatite with CPC as the collector. Adsorption isotherm showed the adsorption of CPC on both minerals are mainly attributed to polar group-surface electrostatic attraction at lower CPC concentration and chain\u2013chain hydrophobic interaction at CPC concentrations above its critical hemimicelle concentration (CHC, 6.47\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a04mol/L). The four region model for adsorbed layer microstructure of CPC on both minerals is also acquired from adsorption isotherm, in addition, further determined from fluorescence emission spectroscopy measurements.",

However, very few studies focus on yield stress affected by the tailing properties of true solid density (T) and bulk density (B), which are the two most common properties used to evaluate a tailing. In the present study, an estimation model for yield stress of fresh uncemented thickened tailings (UTT) is proposed and verified based on rheological experimental results. As the model relates to the true solid density, bulk density, and solid concentration (C) of tailings, it is referred to as the TBC model. The change trend of yield stress with the variation of TBC properties is expressed by the first derivative of the TBC model. Results show that yield stress increases with true solid density and solid concentration, whereas the variation is reversed for bulk density. This study enhances our understanding of yield stress and helps predict the yield stress of thickened tailings according to their TBC properties.",

Ethylhexadecyldimethylammonium bromide (EHDABr) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used as collectors and Dowfroth250 and methyl isobutyl carbonyl (MIBC) as frothers. The effective parameters were investigated by the experimental design performed by DX7 software. In this regard, a two-level factorial method was used, and sixteen experiments including 6-level variables were designed. In the first step, the tests were conducted in a Hallimond tube. It was concluded from test results that the optimum conditions for the removal of Ni(II) and Zn(II) ions by initial concentrations of 10\u00a0ppm were: pH\u00a0=\u00a03, SDS\u00a0=\u00a0300\u00a0ppm, Dowfroth250\u00a0=\u00a090\u00a0ppm and air flow rate\u00a0=\u00a01.8\u00a0ml/min. In the second step, optimal results from the first step were evaluated in a mechanical flotation cell. In optimal conditions, the recovery of Ni(II) and Zn(II) ions were 88% and 92%, respectively at 60\u00a0min.

The optimization of rotor\u2013stator mechanisms improves the metallurgical performance and decreases the energy consumption of a flotation cell. The angle of the impeller blades, which is an important aspect of the design of rotor\u2013stator mechanisms, significantly impacts the pumping and power consumption of a flotation cell. The flow pattern of a flotation cell with different impellers was investigated by combining PIV measurements and CFD simulation. PIV and CFD also revealed the flow field characteristics of the test cross-section under the impeller. The PIV measurement results agree with the CFD prediction results, and the backward impeller, radial impeller and forward impeller all produce similar flow patterns with upper and lower circulations. The velocity-area method, which integrates the axial velocity in the area of the selected section using CFD simulation, can be used to calculate the impeller circulation volume. The circulation volumes of the backward impeller and radial impeller are almost identical and are approximately 7% larger than that of the forward impeller. Thus, the backward impeller and radial impeller are better choices when large-volume circulation is needed. Based on the CFD simulation, the power consumption of the backward impeller is 13% less than that of the radial impeller and 19% less than that of the forward impeller. The backward impeller was shown to save more energy than the other two impellers, and it can decrease the operation cost for concentrators. This study aids the structural design of impellers for KYF flotation cells.",

Measurements of contact angle and wetting heat were conducted to examine the interaction between ultra-fine coal particles and flotation reagents. The results showed that low-ash ultra-fine coal particles have very strong adsorption to both collector and frother, whereas high-ash ultra-fine coal particles have strong adsorption to collector but weak adsorption to frother, which indicates that frother may play a more important role in the recovery of coarse coal particles.",

Often the detachment of a particle is described in terms of a modified Bond number (expressed as ratio of attachment force to detachment force) greater than 1.0 however very few studies include attachment force in the numerical modelling. Acknowledging the dynamic interaction of bubble\u2013particle aggregate in an actual flotation system, in this work, a dynamic model of the particle motion on the bubble interface was developed based on Schulze's theory considering contributions from gravity, buoyancy, pressure force, capillary force and the fluid drag. The purpose of this modelling was to check the consistency of the particle detachment criterion at Bond number greater than 1.0. Transient magnitudes of both the attaching and detaching forces were presented and the resulting temporal variation of the Bond number was reported. It was found that during the process of particle motion, although the Bond number exceeded the limiting value of 1.0, the particle still remained attached to the bubble interface. It appears that the criterion holds good only for a steady state case when the Bond number remains less than 1.0 and not for a dynamic case where the Bond number may exceed 1.0.",

     "abstract": "Use of large dense medium cyclones (DMCs) is a potential trend in the coal industry but its usage is limited by the poor separation efficiency of fine particles. This paper presents a numerical study of the multiphase flows and performance of DMCs used for coal preparation by means of the two-fluid model. The validity of the model has been verified by various applications. It is used here to study the behaviours of fine particles in a 2-m DMC that is larger than the biggest DMCs reported thus far in the coal industry. The numerical results show that in the extra-large DMC, the poor separation efficiency of fine particles gets worse compared to that of a widely used 1-m DMC. This deficiency is found to be attributed to the strong vortexes developed and the asymmetrical separation zone that can be characterised by the correlation between pressure gradient and tangential velocity. Several modifications with respect to mounting degree, operational Head, conical section length, and inlet number are introduced to improve the performance of the 2-m DMC. It is shown that the separation efficiency of fine particles in the 2-m DMC can be better compared to the 1-m DMC by increasing the Head or conical section length, because such modifications reduce the asymmetrical separation zone and/or amount of vortexes.",

In this study, a gasliquid two phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been applied to investigate the gas-slurry flow in an industrial scale leaching tank. Following model validation using measurement data from a laboratory gas-stirred reactor, the CFD model has been extended to study flow dynamics in an industrial scale Pachuca tank with different designs. The likely effects of the introduced gas bubble size and the draft tube diameter on tank performance are assessed in terms of the overall flow patterns, gas holdup, bubble residence time distribution, slurry mixing, as well as the solid sedimentation region. It was found that the slurry flow in the tank is dominated by strong global re-circulations with slurries being pumped up inside the riser, followed by a downward motion in the downcomer before re-joining the riser from the draft tube bottom. There are no local re-circulations observed in the riser and downcomer regions for the original design and the proposed new designs. The new design with either reducing the gas bubble size or increasing the draft tube diameter increases gas holdup, promotes solid mixing and reduces the solid sedimentation region. Simulation results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of the present modelling approach as a useful numerical tool to help potential improvement of industrial scale Pachuca tank design and/or operation.",

To mimic the strength gained after the die compaction and brittle behaviour of compacts under compression, a bonded particle model was introduced between contacting particles. The simulated stress\u2013strain responses were comparable with those observed from the physical experiments, confirming the validity of the model. The analyses of the evolutions of the structure and force during the die compaction indicated that the consolidation was initiated from the upper moving punch and gradually propagated to the lower stationary punch. The inhomogeneity of density and force trees was also observed. In the unconfined compression, the main characteristics of the stress\u2013strain response, i.e., the linear increasing part, peak value and residual stress state, were captured in the simulations. The brittle failure of the compact was due to the broken inter-particle bonds by shear and tensile stress. The compressive strength of compacts increased with the consolidation pressure, bond thickness and bond strength. This work indicated that the DEM model with a proper interparticle bond model is able to study the mechanical strength of compacts.",

Within the bulk material handling process the action of material free fall is generally unavoidable. In this case, the adjacent air surrounding the free falling stream is induced into the stream of bulk material as the particles naturally dilate, which results in generation of dust upon subsequent compaction of the stream. Obtaining a better understanding of the way air is induced into the stream of bulk material, and the quantity of the induced air, will assist in the design of more efficient dust control systems.In this paper the interaction between the particles and the air is reviewed. A series of computer simulations and physical experiments have been carried out. The particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique has been employed to measure the fluid velocity within a free falling stream of coarse material. Each experiment was also simulated using Ansys CFX. Particle and air velocities as well as air entrainment readings from simulation have been compared with experimental measurements and theoretical formulas.

This paper presents several distinct sections that detail the experimental and simulation results as well as a comparison of these two methods while also including a discussion of existing theories.",

The model was then used to predict the solid and gas temperature distributions along the height of the bed, the heat loss, and the operating and design conditions for scale-up of the CCMB to semi-industrial and industrial operations.Two scenarios were examined using the model to determine conditions for i) minimising the solid outlet temperature and ii) maximising the gas outlet temperature. The model can also be used to determine the nominal bed height to ensure that the designed gas outlet temperature is achieved. The modelling results suggest that a relatively small bed height (below 0.5\u00a0m) will be sufficient for heat exchange. The model also suggests that a solid to gas mass flow rate ratio of 0.8 should be used to minimise the solid outlet temperature, while a ratio of 1.0 should be used to maximise the gas outlet temperature. Therefore an appropriate operating window for a CCMB heat exchanger for recovering heat from hot slag was found with a solid to gas mass flow rate ratio between 0.8 and 1.",

In addition, the sinter pot tests were conducted to obtain the TI of the produced sinter. The influencing factors on assimilation temperature (AT), the relations between the 4 characteristics of BSCs, and the factors influencing the V\u2013Ti sinter TI were analyzed. The results showed that the BSCs of 5 kinds of V\u2013Ti ores DB, HW, YT, JL and FH were good except liquid phase fluidity characteristic index (LF). The key reason why V\u2013Ti sinter had a poor TI was the low LF, which caused the sinter with a large-pore structure. Therefore, the matching ores for optimization V\u2013Ti blends should have a high LF. In addition, self-strength of the bonding phase (BS) and crystal intensity (CI) had an important impact on TI when the melt formed was sufficient and meanwhile the melt had a high LF. Moreover, the proper AT was the prior factor for the melt generation. In addition, the optimization V\u2013Ti blends had good BSCs. The sinter TI with 7% NF ore addition could meet the production requirements for its TI was higher than 65%. Totally, the method of V\u2013Ti magnetite ore blend optimization for sinter strength based on iron ore basic sintering characteristics was useful.",

The results suggested that in a wet grinding system, the primary function of mechanical power was to prompt formation of crystal defects on ZnO rather than reduction in crystal size of ZnO. The mechanical grinding activated ZnO particles, decreased the binding energy between Zn and O, improved the solubility of ZnO, and formed more associating hydroxyls.

Indeed, bubble surface area flux (Sb) has been found to correlate with the collection zone flotation rate constant and is therefore a potential variable to regulate in order to achieve a target performance. Sb can be calculated as a combination of two other gas dispersion properties, namely, gas superficial velocity and the Sauter bubble mean diameter. This communication describes the design and implementation of a feedback control system for the Sauter bubble mean diameter in an attempt towards controlling Sb. In order to track changes on bubble size, the Sauter bubble mean diameter was derived from an adaptive bubble size probability density function (PDF). A Gaussian mixture model was used to represent the bubble size PDF and its parameters were updated on-line and in real-time by a dedicated computer from sequentially incoming images. To improve bubble size controllability, a frit-and-sleeve sparging device was installed. This device allows modifying bubble size by manipulating the water flow rate circulating through a sleeve surrounding a porous ring (shear water). A Wiener model is used to represent the dynamic relationship between the shear water flow rate and the Sauter bubble mean diameter. A nonlinear control, based on the internal model control (IMC) structure, was designed and implemented. Tracking and regulation performance against gas velocity and unmeasured frother concentration variations were then successfully evaluated in a two-phase system.",

Also in the reduction\u2013softening test under load, the fluxed pellets reduced to a higher final degree of reduction, although they started to soften at a somewhat lower temperature. Swelling and cracking of the pellets during dynamic reduction were slightly increased by the addition of limestone, but not remarkably. Adding limestone slightly decreased the Cold Crushing Strength and increased the formation of fines in the hematite to magnetite reduction stage in the LTD test. However, all four parameters (CCS, LTD, swelling, and cracking) are within the acceptable range for blast furnace use.",

It was found that Ca2\u00a0+ ions interacted strongly with kaolinite and illite in enhancing their rheological properties. Gypsum was found to have the highest solubility in water and released the largest quantity of Ca2\u00a0+ ions resulting in a significant interaction with illite and kaolinite. Calcite and dolomite were found to be less soluble and exhibited a lower interaction with these clay minerals. This study also investigated the interaction of the three calcium bearing minerals with bentonite, a swelling clay mineral. Gypsum had the greatest interaction with bentonite as well but affected the rheological characteristics of bentonite in the opposite way to that observed with illite and kaolinite. Ca2\u00a0+ ions released from gypsum dispersed bentonite slurries by preventing the swelling of this clay mineral. This study suggests that when looking at ores with clay minerals, it is important to consider the potential input from other gangue minerals for the interactions in determining the rheological behaviour.",

With a sample from one plant the glass content was increased from 88% to 92% while with a completely different sample, from another plant, the glass content in the process feed was 59%, attaining 71% in the glass concentrate.

     "abstract": "Generally, in pelletizing process, the magnetite ore is oxidized to hematite during induration as an exothermic reaction; thereby the magnetite ore requires less energy compared to hematite ore. This form of heat generation inside the pellet is much more efficient than the transferred one from hot gases heated by external burners. This mechanism leads to higher production rates with lower total energy consumption. In order to achieve these improvements, different amounts of anthracite as the solid fuel (0 to 0.95\u00a0wt.%) were added to the initial mixture of hematite (60%) and magnetite (40%) ores. The portion of hematite was reduced to magnetite phase by anthracite, and then the produced magnetite re-oxidized again to secondary hematite. Afterwards, the studies of mechanical and reducibility behaviors of pellets were performed by the tumbler/abrasive indexes and the Linder experimental tests. Furthermore, the microstructural evaluation was carried out by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results demonstrated that by anthracite addition to the mixture, the production rate was significantly increased (more than 30%) while the natural gas consumption was reduced at least 35%. Moreover, based on the strength and reducibility analyses, the anthracite addition up to 0.78% (as an optimal amount) caused considerably to the betterment of fired iron ore pellet properties.",

     "abstract": "This paper describes an innovative method to calculate the quality of a stockpile in real-time to improve the efficiency in stockpile blending operations. A stockpile is modelled as a grid of voxels (octants), which are used as geometric elements for both quality calculations and result storage. The quality calculation is based on the real geometric shape of the stockpile which is measured by a laser scanner. Furthermore, a BWR (Bucket Wheel Reclaimer), which is treated as a mobile robot arm, is incorporated into this model to predicate the quality of the reclaimed material. Thus, this 3D quality embedded model can be used to calculate, plan, control and predict the quality level of iron ore being stacked and/or reclaimed with a great degree of accuracy. This model provides an opportunity to monitor and track quality data throughout the blending operations. It will lead to proactive and continuous blending activities that fundamentally improve quality control and increase efficiency in stockpile management.",

Analyses on the geometric parameters, interaction energies, natural bond orbital (NBO), and frontier molecular orbital reveal that there are two main structures in the metal\u2013ethyl xanthate complexes, whose structure of metal atom with two sulfur atoms was more stable. Different spin status significantly influences the interaction of Fe ions with EX as well as the geometric structure of its complex. The most spin state for Fe2\u00a0+ was spin-V, while it was spin-IV for Fe3\u00a0+. The binding energy of Fe3\u00a0+ and EX is larger than that of Fe2\u00a0+ and EX. Similarly, the binding energy of Cu2\u00a0+ and EX is larger than that of Cu+ and EX. The covalent interaction between EX ion and Cu+ is relatively weak, whereas the ionic bond interaction is relatively strong. The solution effect hasn't been taken into account, but important information related to multi-spin states has been gained. The theoretical calculations in the present work may help explain the flotation mechanism and flotability difference of iron-bearing and copper-bearing minerals.",

This investigation addresses the interactive effect of process parameters on the processing of Indian iron ore slimes by using column flotation. The iron ore slime containing 58.7% Fe, 5.2% SiO2 and 4.9% Al2O3 was used for this investigation. The subsequent size analysis, chemical characterisation, desliming and column flotation tests were performed targeting the effect of process parameters on the flotation behaviour of the slimes. A factorial design of experimental approach was followed using three variables at two levels namely froth height, superficial air velocity, and collector dosage. The dosages of frother and depressant were held constant. Froth height plays a significant role on recovery and Fe-grade in the concentrate. The interaction effects of the variable factors on recovery and Fe grade of concentrate were studied. The relationship between the residence time of air in froth zone and recovery was also established. Increased residence time demands more collector dosage for high recovery of the concentrate. Recovery of the concentrate could be improved to 63% (54.6% overall recovery) with a grade of 64.3% Fe, 1.9% silica and 2.2% alumina.",

     "abstract": "Thermal and chemical treatments were used to investigate the solubilization of potassium from verdete, a glauconitic rock. Fluxing agents were evaluated at distinct temperatures and proportions. Chemical dissolution of verdete was studied with increasing amounts of acids or bases at different temperatures and reaction times. In the calcination test, the presence of fluxing agents was critical to increasing the rock solubility, in addition to the effects of temperature and material ratios. The content of water-soluble K was 100, 100, 85, and 42% when using the salts LiCl, CaCl2.2H2O, Na2CO3, NaCl, respectively, as fluxing agents. The salts CaSO4, CaCO3 and Ca3(PO4)2 were ineffective as fluxing agents. In the chemical treatments, the reaction with the base NaOH was more efficient than the acids to solubilize K. It was possible to solubilize up to 60% of K from verdete with 4.0\u00a0mol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 NaOH, at 150\u00a0\u00b0C for 120\u00a0min.

The adsorption data obtained was well described by Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich (D\u2013R) isotherm models.

     "abstract": "Mineral processing tailings are complex mixtures of minerals residual from the parent ore and minerals formed during processing. The number of minerals present in tailings samples, and their unusual composition and structure compared with minerals naturally occurring at the Earth's surface, poses challenges for quantification of mineral concentrations. Determination of mineral concentrations in tailings can be required to meet legislative requirements, to conduct geochemical modeling, and to optimize mineral processing efficiency. This review compares techniques for quantification of mineral concentrations in bauxite residue (alumina refining tailings), as a case study, and highlights major sources of inaccuracy in quantification methods. Although alternative techniques exist for the quantification of mineral concentrations in bauxite residues, Rietveld refinement-based quantitative phase analysis is likely to be more accurate and precise than methods based on chemical extraction, normative calculation, or single X-ray diffraction peaks. The problems of microabsorption, caused by both heavy and light X-ray absorbing minerals being present in a sample, and non-ideal mineral compositions, such as those of minerals formed during ore processing (desilication product minerals, in the case of bauxite residue), are particularly difficult and impractical to eliminate completely; however, they may be minimized by careful sample preparation and analysis, and further characterization of process characteristic minerals.",

The significance of the formation of ferric hydroxide islands in accounting for the corresponding hydrophilic surface state is revealed not only from experimental contact angle measurements but also from simulated contact angle measurements using MDS.

Results of the froth column tests show that despite of the increasing froth height, the bubble coalescence in the froth or bursting on the surface can be decreased considerably by using the nanomaterials. The effect of the increase in froth height on the Sauter-mean bubble size and the bubble coalescence was found to be negligible by using the nanomaterials in all pH values used. These effects of the nanomaterials could not be attributed to both signs and magnitudes of their surface charges.It was determined that the nanomaterials used in this study did not contribute to the flotation efficiency at shallow froth. Contrary to this, the nanomaterials, in particular nano-sized Fe2O3 and Al2O3, provide a significant increase in barite recovery (7\u201311%) at deep froth, which means that selection of the type of the nanomaterials to be used in flotation is also important. As a result of the use of the nanomaterial, the decrease in the flotation performance at deep froths was found to be negligible.",

The effects of heating rate, added amount of CaO, holding temperature and holding time on oxidation efficiency were investigated. Thermodynamic calculations show that the fayalite is more likely to be oxidized than vanadium spinel, formation of calcium vanadates is easier than that of Mn(VO3)2 and Mg(VO3)2 and the oxidation of Fe2\u00a0+ in augite is hindered by the presence of diopside. TGA results show that lowering the heating rate can improve the oxidation efficiency of vanadium. The maximum vanadium recovery of 93.3% was achieved when the vanadium slag with a ratio of m(CaO)/m(V2O5) of 0.42 was roasted at 850\u00a0\u00b0C for 2.5\u00a0h.

The consortium constituted by both enrichment cultures achieved a successful biooxidation of Hualilan ore allowing the increase of gold recovery up to 96.4% in the best culture condition (low pulp density in 1\u00a0K medium). At the same time, this condition showed an effective zinc bioleaching (up to 86%) although the recovery was much higher in cultures with initially supplemented iron; kinetics studies suggested that the bioleaching rate in 1\u00a0K medium at low pulp densities is controlled by diffusion through a layer mainly constituted by jarosite (rather than sulfur) which was detected in X-ray diffraction diagrams. The recovery of zinc as a subproduct of the pretreatment to optimize gold recovery would also allow the decrease of the metallic charge of the leachates from the biooxidation tanks which is an environmental advantage.",

It was found that the effect of molecular weight on adsorption was insignificant and all four guar gums produced similar adsorption densities on the talc particles. Turbidity data also showed that all four polymers were strong flocculants of fine talc particles. However, higher molecular weight samples were more powerful than lower molecular weight samples. Higher doses of the polymers led to steric re-dispersion of talc, and lower molecular weight polymers were more efficient in dispersing talc than higher molecular weight polymers. Finally, all four polymers were equally effective as depressants of talc flotation. Most interestingly, it was found that the strongest depression of talc flotation was accompanied by very strong flocculation of the fine talc particles. Implications of these phenomena to the entrainment of fine talc during the froth flotation process were also discussed.",

Leaching of alumina from CFA in an economical way is very difficult, which either requires higher chemical consumption or application of stringent reaction conditions such as high temperature and pressure. In this paper a simple alternative method has been attempted to dissolve alumina from CFA. Addition of fluoride ion as HF improved the acid leaching performance of fly ash to a large extent. XRD data showed mullite, the alumina bearing phase, as the major phase which gets dissolved during leaching operation. A standard procedure for the precipitation of alumina can be employed after the leached solution is obtained.",

It was found that the maximum extraction percent of vanadium occurs at pH\u00a01.8 under ambient conditions; this phenomenon was ascribed to the predominant presence of cationic species of vanadium (VO2+) at this pH. Based on the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrums, the POH bond of D2EHPA was found responsible for the extraction of VO2+ species through a cationic exchange mechanism. Employing the slope analysis method showed that the stoichiometric reaction between VO2+ and D2EHPA was VO 2 + + RH \u2194 VO 2 R \u00af + H + regardless of the D2EHPA concentration. It was also shown that the TBP has no synergistic effect on the VO2+ extraction except in the experiments conducted at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. This was further elucidated by applying a modifying factor for TBP in the slope analysis method.

Leaching experiment showed that the leaching rate of copper was 73.6% after 20\u00a0days bioleaching. Results of scanning electron microscopy of leaching residues showed that the surface of chalcopyrite was gradually corroded. Results of SR-XRD showed that orthorhombic form \u03b1-S8, jarosite and chalcocite were produced at day 4; the bioleaching residue contained jarosite, covellite and \u03b1-S8 besides chalcopyrite from day 8. The Cu, Fe and S K-edge XANES spectra quantitatively analyzed the copper, iron and sulfur species compositions of leaching residues, and the fitted results showed similar trend to SR-XRD results. According to both SR-XRD and XANES study, bornite and amorphous elemental sulfur \u03bc-S were not found during bioleaching of chalcopyrite by S. thermosulfidooxidans. By conclusion, it indicated that iron-deficiency sulfide chalcocite first formed at the initiation of bioleaching with a low Eh value, and it then gradually transformed to covellite at a high Eh value. Meanwhile, \u03b1-S8 and jarosite were produced as the predominant intermediates. By combining SR-XRD and XANES, it was useful for better understanding the dissolution mechanism of chalcopyrite during bioleaching by qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing in situ the surface chemical composition of the minerals.",

The formation of lazurite (Na7Al6Si6O24\u00b7S3) and sulfur-containing zeolite (Na8Al6Si6O24\u00b7S\u00b74H2O) induce the incorporation of sulfur into the desilication products, resulting in a remarkable decrease of sulfur concentration in liquors, and the decrement of sulfur concentration increases with the increase in the amount of desilication products and temperature. The results of the treatment of sulfur-free desilication products prepared atmospherically with sodium aluminate solutions bearing S2\u00a0\u2212 indicate that sulfur can be incorporated into the residue by dissolving sulfur-free desilication products and subsequently transforming to less soluble sulfur-containing desilication products.

Two types of copper ores with different mass-density and copper-density distributions were analysed. Energy and water can be saved using the DSFB to reject gangue early but the loss of valuable copper makes the revised flow sheet uneconomical. If the low density ore rejected by the DSFB is sent to heap leaching, both reduced water and energy consumption as well as increased profit are possible for one of the ores. In order for the DSFB to be useful in increasing profit, the ore should have copper content a strong function of density (greater than linear). This type of ore is amenable to processing by DSFB and heap leaching, because a large fraction of the feed can be sent directly to heap leaching rather than being ground resulting in significant reduction in energy and water consumption with minimal loss (or even slightly improved) recovery of copper.",

     "abstract": "Manganese lump ores are still the main raw material used in the manufacture of manganese ferroalloys, but the processing of the ore to the beneficiation point generates fines. So an alternative to be studied is making pellets. This work compares the main geometallurgical characteristics of the lump ore from the Azul Mine and the pellets made from fines generated during beneficiation of this lump ore on a small scale. The characteristics assessed were: the chemical composition, mineralogical constitution, hot and cold particle disintegration, thermal decomposition and solid state reduction. It can be observed that the pellets contain a greater proportion of manganese oxides than the lump ore and they are also richer in Mn. In the pellets the hot and cold particle disintegration phenomena are minimal when compared with those found in lump ore. Lump ore can be efficiently reduced in the solid state, while most of the manganese minerals in the pellets have already been reduced to MnO. The conclusion is that manufacturing pellets in order to take advantage of the manganese ore fines is a path that must be studied further, since the pellets can be used as a viable source of manganese and act as agents that contribute to the increase in permeability of the charge. But possible reductions in the temperature of the granular zone during solid state reduction need to be considered.",

The nanobubbles were generated by selective separation from microbubbles, which are formed together after depressurizing-cavitation of the saturated water in air (as in pressure flotation or dissolved air flotation), at 66.1\u00a0psi saturation pressure. Flotation with single nanobubbles was not effective due to their very low lifting power or practically nil buoyancy. Yet, size-by-size flotation recoveries with coarse plus nanobubbles, compared with coarse bubbles, enhanced by 20\u201330 % the very fine quartz fractions by 20\u201330% (8\u201374\u00a0\u03bcm; Sauter diameter\u2014D32) and slightly lowered the recoveries of coarse particles (67\u2013118\u00a0\u03bcm; D32 diameter). Flotation of quartz samples (composites) having wide particle size distribution and results in a mechanical cell validated the overall recovery enhancement of the fines. Fine particle capture (nanobubbles enhanced the contact angle of quartz) and aggregation of the quartz ultrafines (proved with micrographs) by the nanobubbles are the main mechanisms responsible for the higher recoveries. The effect on flotation of the coarser quartz fractions, at bench scale, may be explained in terms of a reduced rising velocity of the coarse bubbles, in the presence of nanobubbles, decreasing the degree of bubble carryover. It is expected that the use of collector-coated nanobubbles (tailor-made \u201cbubble-collectors\u201d and flocculants) will broaden options in fine mineral flotation.

The substitution of different amounts of Mg, Mn and V in the crystal structure of ilmenite was identified by microprobe analysis. Different amounts of hemoilmenite exsolution were observed inside all three ilmenite samples using SEM, electron microprobe and X-ray diffraction analyses.

     "abstract": "At present, nearly 99% of the world's niobium concentrate is produced by the Catal\u00e3o and Arax\u00e1 mines in Brazil and the Niobec mine (St. Honor\u00e9) in Canada. In total, Arax\u00e1 produces approximately 150,000\u00a0tonnes of niobium per annum (tpa), while Niobec and Catal\u00e3o produce 5300\u00a0tpa and 4500\u00a0tpa, respectively. Niobium recovery at all three operations is near or above 60%, with final concentrates grading 55\u201365% Nb2O5. The geographic diversification of niobium supply depends on the development of operable beneficiation flowsheets for the upgrading of known niobium deposits worldwide. The beneficiation of niobium oxide ores is predominantly carried out by froth flotation, which generally involves niobium mineral flotation at acid pH using a cationic amine collector. In the case of the Niobec and Catal\u00e3o mines, there is a reverse gangue mineral flotation step prior to niobium flotation. The main issues associated with currently employed flowsheets are loss of niobium to the gangue mineral concentrate and the slime fraction. Further, there are a number of gaps in understanding with regard to the mechanisms by which amine collectors and auxiliary reagents interact with one another and with niobium minerals. To date, several alternate flotation reagents such as hydroxamates, sulfosuccinates, phosphorous compounds, and hydroxyquinolines have been examined with the aim of improving niobium recovery and concentrate grade in the flotation process. Notably, alkyl hydroxamates were identified in the 1960s as a potential collector for direct niobium mineral flotation eliminating the need to first deslime the ore. Subsequent testwork performed on Niobec ore using this collector has corroborated its effectiveness without desliming. However, due to increased reagent addition requirements when using hydroxamate collectors, the cost benefit of this reagent scheme compared to amine collectors is unclear. Overall, greater understanding of mechanisms at play in currently employed reagent systems is required to effectively improve plant operating conditions and maximize recovery at the industrial scale. Future testwork should also be conducted on real ores using reagents that have been identified as selective collectors at the single mineral flotation level.",

The scrap has generally been considered to be tin oxide and suitable for recovery using electrolysis or reduction with charcoal and fuel oil at temperatures above 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. This experimental work examines alternative processes for the recovery of metallic tin from this scrap. Microstructural and chemical characterisation of the scrap revealed that metallic tin was the predominant phase and was surrounded by a cover layer of tin oxide ranging in thickness from a few \u03bcm (micrometres) to 100\u00a0\u03bcm. It was shown that even the thin layer of tin oxide prevented the coalescence of the metallic tin and inhibited recovery. It was concluded that removal of the oxide layer is the key step required in recovering the metal. The removal of the tin oxide was attempted using mechanical attrition (grinding in a ball mill) and chemical dissolution of the tin oxide layer by means of hydrochloric acid (HCl). The results of attrition in a ball mill indicated that the tin oxide covering layer was effectively reduced from the material over 53\u00a0\u03bcm and the removed oxide was concentrated in particles less than this size. Furthermore, the remaining tin oxide layer can be almost completely removed by an acidic treatment with 2\u00a0M HCl at room temperature and agitation for 30\u00a0min. A flow sheet for the recovery of the metallic tin is presented below based on the obtained experimental results.",

     "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between energy and the generation of minus 75 micron material. Rittinger's law of comminution states that the energy input is proportional to the generation of new surface area. An accurate and consistent measurement of surface area, applicable across multiple size ranges, is required to apply this practically. The amount of new \u2212\u00a075\u00a0\u03bcm material generated has previously been proposed as a proxy for surface area. This has been demonstrated to some extent on a range of different laboratory equipment, but not in a manner suited to equipment-independent ore characterisation. To this end the JK Rotary Breakage Tester (JKRBT) and Sch\u00f6nert breakage device have been used to measure the progressive production of fines from cumulative single impacts starting with 37.5\u00a0mm particles down to 250\u00a0\u03bcm. As per expectation, the generation of \u2212\u00a075\u00a0\u03bcm material was found to be proportional to the specific energy, but there was a secondary influence of size. A model was developed to describe the breakage and it was found that the standard t10 relationship could be used to effectively calculate the size specific energy. Measuring the intrinsic competence of an ore in this way can then be used to assess the energy efficiency of full-scale mills in relation to a lab scale test. It is envisaged that this relationship also has the potential to be used in the design of new comminution circuits. The methodology and the results from its application are presented for discussion and review.",

     "abstract": "Modern comminution research and development are mainly product driven rather than material driven. An opinion that is gaining acceptance throughout the comminution community is that it is desirable for the comminution field to evolve toward material driven process design. To this end, this paper introduces the concept of mechanical texture, which corresponds to those textural properties of materials that have a direct bearing on their mechanical and fracture properties, which in turn should be the primary target for comminution process research and equipment design. The paper shows that mass specific fracture energy Ecs is a fracture parameter that is highly sensitive to variations in material texture, leading to selecting Ecs as a sound mechanical texture index. The paper then shows that, in the case of concrete, a set of specific features of the fracture porosity that can be measured inside concrete texture correlate highly with Ecs, thereby defining mechanical texture for concrete comminution. The demonstration that it is possible to establish a direct link between textural properties of concrete and macroscopic properties relevant to comminution shows that material driven comminution process modeling and design are possible and should be encouraged.",

It is unknown how much energy is associated with each microprocess and what the ratios are between the energies dissipated by the different microprocesses. Based on an experimental study, a model has been developed to calculate a critical compaction velocity and the energy dissipated by flow losses. The critical compaction velocity describes the probability of the deaeration of a particle bed. Since the flow losses consume less than 0.1% of the total energy input, this microprocess can be considered negligible compared to others.",

     "publication date": "03-2015",
     "abstract": "High-pressure comminution is regarded as an important technology in grinding circuits primarily because it offers considerable energy savings. HPGRs can only be operated energy efficient under choke feeding condition in which a material bed is formed between the rollers that improve the interparticle breakage. The slow load application to the particles causes the structural collapse of the grains which minimize energy losses such as heat and noise. To increase the amount of fines in the product (cake) of HPGR, the recycling load can be used up to some extent and a higher pressure gradient along the roller width is obtained. This application may result in compact flakes containing more fines. An extensive testwork was performed with an industrial HPGR unit in a cement plant in Turkey to elucidate the effects of recycling load together with the operational parameters on HPGR's performance. For this purpose the recycling load of the circuit was changed as in different ratios to the fresh feed flow rate during the testwork. Six different tests were performed and for each test, samples were collected from HPGR total feed and discharge in the steady state condition. After sampling campaigns, the particle size distributions of all samples were determined and mass balancing around the circuit was performed. Capacity, pressure and gap relationships were investigated. According to the data acquired, it was shown that the reduction ratio of the HPGR is getting higher with the recycling load for the same specific motor output power. The flake thickness indicates the same situation, as well. More compacted flakes were produced for higher recycling load ratios.",

     "abstract": "In the dry grinding industry the demand for very fine particle size distributions is increasing rapidly. At the same time a growing awareness for an economical management of our planet's resources has raised the demand for energy efficient processes.Roller mills in general and specifically pendular roller mills are best suited to meet these conflictive demands, since they can, up to this day, produce particle size distributions with a D97\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm while evidencing comparatively low power consumption values and high solids throughputs.The design of the pendular roller mill is thus far based on the experience gathered from industrially utilized mills. Due to the aforementioned development of roller mill applications this experience will no longer be sufficient for guaranteeing a successful scale-up process. In order to find valid scale-up rules for fine grinding pendular mills the operating behavior of such mills must first be fully understood.The grinding process in roller mills can be subdivided into the following steps: comminution between the rollers and the grinding ring, classification and solids transport between milling zone and classifier. In order to verify and improve the existing scale-up methods all process steps must be completely characterized.In order to characterize the comminution process a new measuring method was developed with which the milling gap between the rollers and the grinding ring and the rotation speed of the rollers can be determined simultaneously. This method was used on a pilot scale pendular roller mill during course and fine grinding processes to investigate the influence of process settings on the comminution conditions.As a result of measuring the milling gap, it is now possible for the first time to measure the relationships between parameters such as energy input, solids throughput, solids hold-up or pressure loss on the one hand and the milling gap on the other hand. These relationships can be used to establish a physical model of the comminution process, from which a scale-up rule for the comminution process can be derived.This publication will show and assess the relation between process parameters and the milling gap for course and fine grinding processes respectively.",

In this context, chalcopyrite ore of a plant having rod and ball milling circuit was ground under different operating modes e.g., air swept and overflow, and process conditions, then samples were collected around the system. The collected samples were characterized in terms of size distributions which were then used in comparing the performances of conventional and VRM systems.

The basis of the simulation software GRAIN is the physical model for single-phase continuum granular flow of (Latz and Schmidt, 2010). It has been validated intensively and has proven its applicability to industrial processes in various cases. We describe herein the extension of that model to multiphase suspension flow, where the single continuum granular phase is coupled to the fluid phase by modeling a suspension viscosity with the goal of simulating TiO2-suspension flow in bead mills. The beads are treated as a granular material within GRAIN and are fully coupled with the suspension flow simulation to the CoRheoS FLUID module. For vertical mills the interface between the wet suspension in the mill and the dry top region is also dynamically calculated. The simulation result in the dynamic calculation of local quantities like density distribution of suspension and beads, velocity fields, pressure distribution, shear forces for all phase and energy dissipation. Virtual performance tests are done by varying throughput rates and rotational speeds. Regarding local stresses and energy dissipation rates the grinding efficiency can be characterized.",

Besides size reduction, stirred mill has the ability to deliver high energy to particles which facilitate crystal structure distortion. High energy stirred milling experiments (up to 300\u00a0kWh/t) were carried out on chalcopyrite concentrate. The media size, mill speed and slurry % solids were kept constant in this experiment. The only operational variable is milling time that results different levels of specific energy. The feed and ground particles were characterized for particle size distribution and mineral phase analysis (XRD). Mechanochemical effect was quantified by calculating the degree of crystallinity, crystallite size and lattice strain. The feed and ground sample undergo leaching test in five different lixiviants. The lixiviants chosen were sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, ferric sulfate and ferric chloride. The minimum particle size and degree of crystallinity obtained were 3.7\u00a0\u03bcm and 42% respectively at 113\u00a0kWh/t. Ferric chloride exhibits the highest Cu dissolution (up to 75%) when it was ground at 113\u00a0kWh/t. Based on the results, this paper has suggested two circuit layouts that may assist mechanochemical effect in order to enhance leaching. Mechanochemical effect exhibited during high energy fine grinding enhances downstream processes i.e. leaching. This is not taken into consideration when evaluating the efficiency of the milling circuit. In the future the milling circuit efficiency should take into consideration the reduction in particle size and mechanochemical effect during milling circuit efficiency evaluation.",

This paper presents the influence of processing parameters (composition of solid component, curing time and temperature) on the compressive strength and hydrolytic stability of this type of alkali activated cements. The effect of red mud addition on the hardening processes, reaction products and material's microstructure was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal analysis (TG & DTA). The main reaction products are sodium silicate or/and sodium silicate aluminates hydrates with amorphous to crystalline morphologies. The amount of reaction products increases with the increase of the initial curing time at 60\u00b0C and consequently it was achieved an increase of the compressive strength values. As a negative side effect the hydrolytic stability of these materials is affected by the increase of the initial curing time at 60\u00b0C. Despite the fact that addition of aluminum to sodium silicate hydrates improve their hydrolytic stability, the expected positive influence of red mud addition to the studied binding systems was not observed. This can be due to the low amount of supplementary aluminum brought in the activator solution by the red mud as well as the high amount of iron phases present also in this waste.",

The metallurgy of the existing, high and low dosage cases was calculated using mass balance. Mineral balancing of the liberated and locked particles was also performed around the bank. The sphalerite was lost to the tail, even in liberated form, with over 21.5% of coarse size in low dosage. Increasing the dosage of the collector did not much affect the liberated pyrite and non-sulphide gangue (NSG) particles, except for finer sizes, which indicated the occurrence of recovery by entrainment. Because sphalerite was mostly locked with pyrite, the amount of sphalerite\u2013pyrite binaries was 21 to 28% higher in the size fractions of the high case.

The results indicate that these collectors have difficulty forming a covalent bond with the silicon atom on the mineral surfaces, while their protonation species can easily adsorb on quartz surface through electrostatic attraction. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been used to study the adsorption of amine derivative collectors on quartz surfaces at a molecular level. In the consideration of solvation effect, a model close to the realistic flotation system is fabricated. Interaction energies for collector-quartz surface have been determined, based on which, AC1201 is found to be the most effective collector. Trend as obtained from the molecular modeling has been validated by microcalorimetry measurements and flotation studies on quartz with DDA, ether amine and AC1201 at different pH and collector concentrations.",

This mill was chosen because of the availability of validated calibration constants for the wear model for this mill. The comparison of the evolution sequences shows that initial small differences in wear profiles for different lifters can lead to quote a different life cycle behaviour \u2014 both for the erosion behaviour of the liner and for the performance of the mill. They also demonstrate that the wear predicted for the new liner does not necessarily well reflect the whole of life wear process as the feedback between the wear and flow can strongly influence the liner life cycle.",

     "abstract": "In the present study, the X-ray diffraction line profile analysis was used for the characterization of structural changes in mechanically activated pyrite by a planetary ball mill. Applying the Williamson-Hall integral breadth and Warren-Averbach methods, comprehensive investigations were carried out on the XRD patterns in order to separate the crystallite size and microstrain contributions in XRD broadened patterns. The analysis of XRD patterns of mechanically activated pyrite indicated that no phase transformation occurred during milling operation. The results revealed that crystallite size and microstrain decreased and increased, respectively, during mechanical activation process. Volume weighted crystallite size (Dv), surface weighted crystallite size (Ds), strain (\u03b5) and root mean square strain (RMSS) changed from 316\u00a0nm, 103.6\u00a0nm, 0.05% and 0.04% in initial pyrite to 57.73\u00a0nm, 25.1\u00a0nm, 0.224% and 0.117%, respectively, in mechanically activated pyrite for 100\u00a0min. In addition, the lattice parameter of mechanically activated pyrite increased as a function of milling time, implying that pyrite lattice volumes were expanded probably due to vacancy formation. Regarding to shape parameter study, the crystallite size broadening portion is more than the strain broadening portion on the broadened peaks in the XRD patterns of mechanically activated pyrite. This may be related to the fracture toughness of pyrite lattice, implying that pyrite structure is refined mainly by decreasing crystallite size rather than lattice strain. From surface area and particle size analysis, it can be confirmed that the agglomeration begins after 50\u00a0min mechanical activation. The X-ray amorphization degree increases to about 70% after 100\u00a0min intensive milling, reflecting the refractory nature of pyrite.",

The enriched TiO2 mineral thus obtained is called synthetic rutile (SR) or beneficiated ilmenite (BI). The quality of the synthetic rutile (in terms of TiO2 content) mainly depends on the condition of leaching process. The present study envisages the effect of acid concentration, temperature, and agitation speed on the leaching of the ore. The kinetics of the leaching reaction follows the first order at normal and stimulated leaching conditions. The highest rate constant value of 5.18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01 was observed for leaching the ilmenite with 30% hydrochloric acid under 700\u00a0rpm and at 70\u00a0\u00b0C. The enthalpy of the reaction (\u0394H) was calculated as 24.157\u00a0kJ/mol and the entropy of the reaction (\u0394S) was calculated as 26.25\u00a0J/mol/K. The positive value of \u0394H indicates the endothermic nature of reaction. The value of \u0394G at different temperature was found to be negative indicating the feasibility of the process and the spontaneous nature of the reaction. The addition of gypsum enhances the leaching process. The rate constant increases with the increase in the gypsum concentration in leaching process.

Under the assumption of tangentially immobile film surfaces, excellent agreement between model and experiment for \u03c4 was obtained for SDS and PPG, whereas \u03c4 was slightly under-predicted for MIBC. The model can be improved by adding an adjustable parameter that is related to the lateral diffusion constant and surface concentration of frother molecules at the air/water interface.",

In this study the implications of the processes during bioleaching of a pyritic chalcopyrite concentrate were analysed regarding its Cu and Fe isotope fractionation. The development of the redox potential during the bioleaching experiment was then simulated in an electrochemical cell in the absence of microorganisms to investigate the effect of microbial activity on the Cu and Fe isotope fractionations. The leaching experiments were performed for 28\u00a0days at 45\u00a0\u00b0C with a solid content of 2.5% (w/v) at pH\u00a01.5. It was found that Cu dissolution efficiency was similar in both experiments and the leaching curves were linear with no sign of passivation due to the presence of pyrite. The heavy Cu isotope (\u03b465Cu) was leached more easily and as a result the leachate was enriched with the heavy Cu isotope at the beginning of both experiments and as the leaching progressed \u03b465Cu values in the leachate became similar to the ones of the chalcopyrite concentrate, confirming an equilibrium fractionation happening in a closed system. There was no distinct difference in the Cu and Fe isotope fractionations in the absence and presence of microorganisms. Finally based on Cu and Fe isotope signatures, a simplified method is suggested for the estimation of the leaching extent during the oxidisation of sulphide materials in natural systems.",

The results suggested that two-stage bioleaching (240\u00a0h) with Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans was the most effective strategy to recover Ni (79%) and V (90%). Whereas integrating bioleaching with alkaline leaching remarkably improved leaching yield of Mo (88%) in a shorter period of time (125\u00a0h).

Kerosene containing 100\u00a0ppm fatty acid was chosen to generate reactive oily bubbles.

The induction time was determined to evaluate the effect of different bubbles on bubble\u2013mineral attachment. This novel technology was compared with conventional air bubble flotation in which collectors were added in the pulp. A shorter induction time and hence a stronger collecting power of the reactive oily bubbles attaching to the unconditioned minerals than the air bubbles attaching to the collector-conditioned minerals were observed.With the addition of sodium silicate as depressant at pH\u00a09, the induction time of reactive oily bubble attaching to dolomite becomes much longer than that attaching to apatite as a result of smaller contact angle of dolomite than apatite, which is opposite to the case of conventional air bubble flotation with collectors added in the pulp. Therefore, a novel phosphate flotation technology is proposed and tested. In this novel technology, apatite is separated from dolomite and quartz using reactive oily bubble with sodium silicate as depressant, followed by separation of dolomite from quartz with conventional air bubble flotation. The results of micro-flotation tests demonstrated a better flotation separation using the proposed novel technology.",

     "abstract": "Mechanical activation of three natural acidic igneous rocks, including granite, pumice, and perlite, was studied using a planetary mill. Positive effects of milling were demonstrated with respect to the compressive strength of mortars with the partial substitution of cement by mechanically activated acidic powders. A set of mortar specimens was made with 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% activated powder replacement.X-ray diffraction and mineralogy studies revealed that the initial granite consists of fully crystalline phases, while pumice and perlite contain not only amorphous but also crypto-crystalline phases. It was found that pumice and perlite rapidly lost their crystalline nature through milling, remaining in solely amorphous phases after 15\u00a0min of milling, whereas granite maintained its crystalline nature even after 45\u00a0min. Milling generates a larger specific surface area, much more remarkable for pumice than for granite and perlite, but due to reactive agglomeration, there was a limitation on the specific surface area of pumice. All three mechanically activated acidic powders had significant effects on strength development especially at the early ages of solidification. But in the long term their effects depended on material type and grinding condition. The greatest strength improvement was achieved by mechanically activating perlite for 30\u00a0min, at 10% substitution in cement mix. Cement consumption can be reduced by up to 30% in weight using mechanically activated powders in cement mix while keeping the 28\u00a0day compressive strength at a satisfactory level. In addition, ultrasonic pulsation of mechanically-activated perlite indicated that the specific surface area was mostly influential and available in the early stages of solidification, while structural changes appeared to be so at later stages of hardening.",

The findings have shown that increasing the initial concentration of Cu2+ leads to a significant enhancement in the metal extractions. At Cu2+ concentrations of \u2265\u00a079\u00a0mM, high extractions (i.e. \u2265\u00a098%) for copper, nickel and iron were obtained over 120\u00a0min. An increase in the concentration of chloride (i.e. from 0.7\u00a0M to 2\u00a0M Cl\u2212) decreased the extraction of copper by up to 40% at 60\u00a0min due to the decrease in the activity of free Cu2+. Rising the temperature from 20\u00a0\u00b0C to 80\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in a 1.38-fold increase in the copper extraction at 120\u00a0min.

Increasing the solids ratio (1\u201315\u00a0w/v) adversely affected the leaching process with no copper extraction at 15\u00a0w/v. However, the extraction of metals (Cu, Ni, Ag and Pd) substantially ameliorated in the presence of oxygen.

It is a promising source for the recovery of potassium and alumina values. India is importing most of its potassium demand from the global market. An attempt is therefore made to extract potassium values from nepheline syenite available in the state of Odisha. It contains 2.8% Fe2O3, 19.9% Al2O3, 55.5% SiO2 and 5.4% K2O as its prime constituents. Magnetic separation and flotation techniques are found unsuitable to recover appreciable amounts of potassium values. Chemical leaching with dilute sulphuric acid could recover only ~\u00a040% of the potassium values. The potassium values present in nepheline syenite are unlocked through roasting with calcium chloride followed by water leaching. In this approach, it is possible to recover ~\u00a099.6% K2O value at 900\u00a0\u00b0C temperature and 30\u00a0min of roasting time. The results indicate that the use of planetary mill grinding prior to roasting is favorable for potassium extraction due to mechanical activation of the potassium bearing phases. The different mineral phases present in the feed and the leach residue have been characterized by using optical microscope, XRD and SEM-EDX which shows a phase conversion of locked potassium into sylvite which is soluble in water.",

In addition to copper, nickel extractions were also high (i.e., up to 92.5% over 120\u00a0min) whilst silver and palladium extractions were limited to \u2264\u00a021.4% and \u2264\u00a069.4%, respectively. Further tests indicated that increasing the solids ratio from 1% to 15% w/v had a deleterious influence on the leaching of metals apparently due to limited availability and rapid depletion of Fe(III) at high solids ratios. The supply of air/oxygen (2\u00a0L/min) or H2O2 (585\u00a0mg/L) for in-situ regeneration of Fe(III) improved the leaching of copper by \u2248\u00a035% over 180\u00a0min, with oxygen being the most effective. This indicates the requirement for the continual regeneration of Fe(III) in the leaching medium. The addition of chloride (25.6\u2013116.5\u00a0g/L Cl\u2212) was found to promote the leaching of metals, particularly silver and palladium with their almost complete extraction (\u2265\u00a099% Ag/Pd) over 120\u00a0min. These findings suggest that acidic ferric sulphate solutions can be suitably used as a potent lixiviant system for the extraction of metals from WEEE.",

A calculation method toward the dynamic model was proposed, and the two-dimensional dynamic process of the interaction between FMMPs was simulated. Furthermore, the energy conversion of single mineral particles to magnetic chains (MCs) was also analyzed. The results show that magnetic dipole\u2013dipole attraction (MDDA) acting on FMMPs was the primary force in the magnetic separation process, and the dynamic process of MC formation from single mineral particles was closely related to time, distance between particles, and the external magnetic-field orientation. For FMMPs arranged in chain structures oriented along the external magnetic field, the time required for FMMPs to form MCs was less than 50\u00a0ms. In addition, the optimum time for MC destruction was in the initial stages (less than 5\u00a0ms) of the MC-formation process; either removal of the permanent magnet or discontinuation of the excitation current was the most direct and efficient way to fragment MCs once formed.",

The effects of adsorbent mass and solution pH were investigated in batch studies whilst initial concentration, flow rate and adsorbent bed mass were considered during fixed bed column studies. A close analysis of all parameters varied showed that initial metal concentration had the greatest effect on metal removal from AMD, with lower initial concentration resulting in more water being treated at breakthrough point. The experimental breakthrough curves for the removal of iron from AMD were fully described by the Yoon-Nelson and Thomas models.

     "abstract": "The La Carolina district, which is located in Jaen (Southern Spain), has experienced important mining activity for centuries. These long-standing mining activities, which have been associated with the presence of a philonian network of metallic sulfides, have generated vast accumulations of mine wastes\u2014primarily tailings impoundments\u2014that contain high levels of heavy metals from ore concentration plants. In this paper, the resolution of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) is analyzed to determine the internal structure of these tailings dams and to assess the influence of the tailings over groundwater and surface water. The \u201cLa Manzana\u201d dam, which is one of the largest sludge dams in the district, was selected to achieve this objective.First, old aerial photographs that were taken prior to the existence of the tailings dam were examined. Second, probing was performed using mechanical drilling, which enabled the identification of the features of the fill material, the thicknesses of the mine tailings and the contact zone between the mining structure and the basement. Third, the probe acts as a piezometer, which is an excellent tool to correlate the geophysical prospecting techniques. The characterization of the internal geometry of this structure has been performed by two ERI surveys, in which electric profiles were obtained under different moisture conditions. During the dry season, this methodology has been effective for identifying the morphology of the structures, contact with the substratum, variations in the vertical and horizontal distribution of the deposited material, and the fracture zones, as well as the contact between the tailings and the substratum on which they are deposited. Conversely, during the wet season, this contact was not distinct in the profile; however, variations in the saturation degree of these deposits, preferential infiltration areas and water flow through the interior of the tailings dam were observed. Last, the ERI survey confirmed the absence of waterproofing measures in the dump areas, which represents a high risk of soil and water pollution in the surrounding areas.",

     "abstract": "Ilmenite concentrates from the Murray Basin region of southeastern Australia are contaminated with chromium impurities that must be removed for the ilmenite to become a satisfactory feedstock for the sulphate route to titania pigment production. The chromia is present primarily as discrete, compositionally variable, chrome-rich spinel grains with a smaller amount as intra-grain chromia distributed as coatings in fractures and pores of weathered ilmenite grains. Characterisation of chromia deportment through a simulated acid sulphate digestion process showed a small but non-negligible solubility of the spinels. Most spinels were resistant to dissolution with the exception of those containing high Fe(Al,Cr)2O4 and magnetite (Fe3O4) components. Intra grain chromia was highly soluble. Processing to achieve low bulk chromia using a magnetising roast procedure must ensure that well crystallised rutile is not produced because of its insolubility in the sulphate process. It is also important that the roast conditions do not substantially increase the magnetite content of the spinels making them more susceptible to dissolution. This work highlights the importance of characterising all spinel composition types within ilmenite concentrates in addition to the level of intra-grain chromia associated with the ilmenite when considering the suitability of Murray Basin primary ilmenites as a feedstock to sulphate route titania pigment plants.",

More than 6400 particles were measured for each mill product with a 99% statistical accuracy. The results showed that, the highest aspect ratio (EAR, BRAR and FAR) and the lowest circularity were obtained by autogenous mill. However, the highest circularity and the lowest aspect ratio were obtained by rod milling. These differences in shape were attributed to the different grinding mechanisms acted in the mills employed. The results of the 3D dynamic image analysis were also compared with previous study for the same mineral based on 2D SEM technique. Although different techniques were used for shape analysis, the results were in good agreement with each other.

It is found that when a moderate level of ultrasonic energy (2.01\u00a0W/L), which will not disperse the settled bed in thickener but enough to open the closed network structure, is delivered to the transition settling zone for 2.5\u00a0min, the bed density in a lab bench top thickener improves from 33.72\u00a0wt.% to 37.48\u00a0wt.%, which is an 11% improvement on bed density. Cryo-SEM is used to image and analyse settled bed aggregates structure changes which clearly demonstrates a denser settled bed after ultrasonic treatment. The combination effects of ultrasonics and rake in the transition zone rearrange the settled bed structure from mainly E-E to mainly F-F clearly shown by the cryo-SEM images. This indicates that the ultrasonication in the transition zone could break up the E-E and E-F associations, which allow loose aggregates to be compacted into much denser F-F aggregates. In situ shear stress measurement also confirms these findings. This technology will be beneficial for tailings' management where the improvement in thickener bed density is environmentally and economically crucial.",

     "publication date": "12-2014",
     "abstract": "Dewatering process is one of the most costly steps in mineral processing and coal washing plants. This fact becomes an important industrial challenge in lignite cleaning. The presence of micropores and relatively low hydrophobic nature of lignitic coal lead to trapping of large quantities of water in the coal matrix especially in fine sizes. Since lignites are used as a common fuel in power stations, they need to be dried to a certain moisture level before feeding to the combustion chamber. Dump feeding in power plants cause inevitable loss of efficiency and may be deleterious for combustion sections. It is thus generally wise to dewater coal as much as possible by physical means before it is dried. However, further dewatering cost in some cases may be prohibitive particularly for fine and hydrophilic particles.In this study, various type and amount of surfactants have been tested to increase the efficiency of coal dewatering. As the hydrophobic characteristic of coals varies and increases with increasing the coal rank, dewatering of bituminous and anthracite type coals can be accomplished using low HLB surfactants (Oily), however, these surfactants are not efficient in the case of low rank coals like lignites and brown coals. A special set-up has been designed to study the effect of high HLB surfactants on dewatering of ultrafine lignite particles. It is shown that, while surfactants with lower HLB number and oily characteristics are the most convenient dewatering reagents for slightly hydrophobic surfaces such as hard coals, surfactants with higher HLB values especially those with HLB of around 10 are the most efficient reagents for dewatering of ultrafine lignite and lower rank coals. The governing mechanisms are discussed in the light of hydrophilicity index and modification of physicochemical conditions.",

In this study, the biooxidation of arsenopyrite was investigated, and a method to increase the biooxidation of sulfidic concentrates was proposed. It was demonstrated that thin sections of single crystals of arsenopyrite were oxidized more efficiently when a microbially produced Fe3\u00a0+ containing solution was used than when solutions of Fe2(SO4)3 \u00b79H2O were used. In the latter case, the crystal structure of the elemental sulfur was markedly different from rhombic sulfur. Studies on the biooxidation of pure arsenopyrite and sphalerite indicated that a layer of elemental sulfur was formed on its surface. This product of biooxidation was identified as elemental sulfur with a \u03b2-modification similar to that of selenium. The microorganisms used in this study were demonstrated to alter the crystal structure of sulfur prior to the oxidation thereof, independent of the type of mineral.During the initial stages of the biooxidation of sulfidic minerals, the ferric iron destroys the bonds on the surface of the crystal lattice. The disrupted surface structure of the sulfides promotes the solubilization of ferrous iron and trivalent arsenic (for arsenopyrite) and enhances the electron flow from the surface to the solution; microbial enzyme systems subsequently transfer these electrons to molecular oxygen.The separation of biooxidation of gold-containing pyrite/arsenopyrite concentrates into the component chemical and biological steps makes it possible to conduct each of the steps under optimal conditions. The two-step oxidation was demonstrated to be significantly more efficient under batch conditions than the standard one-step biooxidation. The oxidation level of arsenopyrite increased from 76.6 to 93.3%.",

Although the S content of the DRI can be reduced to some extent by increasing roasting time as well as improving roasting temperature, its level is still too high for steelmaking. The results of scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy showed that when sodium sulfate was added, FeS was generated in the reduced briquette. FeS was intimately intermixed with metallic iron, which was difficult to remove. Therefore, sodium sulfate was not a suitable additive for the reduction of high-phosphorus oolitic hematite ore.",

     "abstract": "Foams represent an important area of research due to their relevance in many industrial processes. In many systems, particulates and surfactants co-exist and can largely define the stability of the foam. A typical example is froth flotation where hydrophobic particles and frothers are essential to maintain a stable froth. Grinding operations may yield a product containing submicron-size particles, which can affect the flotation process. The present study compares the foaming and gas dispersion properties of the non-ionic surfactants 1-pentanol, tri(propylene glycol) methyl ether, and poly(propylene glycol) 425 in the presence of hydrophobic colloidal silica particles in a column. In all cases, it has been found that the gas holdup increases proportionally with the increase in the concentration of particles in the system although an initial decrease may be observed. The effect of particles on the foaminess seems to be dependent upon the surfactant. With the 1-pentanol, the addition of particles systematically decreased the foaminess of the solutions. This is in contrast to poly(propylene glycol) solutions, which exhibited an increase. Interestingly, low concentrations of particles appeared to improve the foaminess of tri(propylene glycol) methyl ether; however, the froth became less stable with further increases in the number of particles in the column. Visual observation showed that the colloidal particles play a crucial role in defining the quality of the structure of the froth.",

Theoretical analysis of single particle packing structure shows that the pore of a high-density coarse layer has a decisive role in the uniform dispersion of airflow.

A mathematical model on bed pressure drop \u0394P, height of high-density coarse layer HCS and fluidizing gas velocity \u03c5 was established based on a dense phase gas\u2013solid separation fluidized bed experiment. Density and distribution of coarse-particle layers combined to form high \u0394P gas distribution boards, which were important in promoting the stability of the fluidized bed with an increase in HCS. HCS had a significant effect on experimental indicators in the actual coal preparation process, followed by the size of the particles in the layer.

A capable, rapid and online measurement technique is presented for analysing the mineral composition of rock drillcore samples.

On the other hand, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) can be used as a rapid method to produce a colour map of minerals based on their fluorescence. These two methods can be combined by calibrating LIF measurements with Raman results. This paper presents a combination of Raman analysis with LIF image analysis to form a rapid online mineral exploration technique used on the rock drillcore samples. To the best knowledge of the authors, the combination of LIF and Raman in the study of rock drillcore has not been published. The sample set under study is segments of rock drillcore collected from a Ni\u2013Cu multi-metal mine situated in Kevitsa, Finland. Scanning drillcore samples using LIF technique produces images which present a map of colours based on emissions of fluorescent minerals. Some parts of the sample set, based on the exposed colours, are measured through Raman spectroscopy and the minerals are identified using reference spectra from a public source. Identification of minerals through Raman analysis is done using Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) method. Results show that colours of LIF images correspond to minerals identified through Raman analysis. The combination of LIF and Raman is then used to produce mineral maps of the drillcore samples and finally an estimation of the mineral abundance per units of drillcore area is developed.",

Also, the boundary layer model and the entrainment model require considerable refinement as mechanics of fluid flow around irregular particles is not well developed. It is shown that CFD simulations show efficiency curves with or without fish hook effect depending upon the assumptions for simulation.The method of sizing analyses in detection of fish hook effect is critically discussed. Most of the occurrences of fish hook are reported when sizing analyses are carried out by laser diffractometry using Fraunhofer approximation for data interpretation. When alternate sizing techniques, such as Andreasen pipette, disc centrifuge, Coulter counter, Dynamic Light Scattering etc. are used or when Mie theory is applied in Laser techniques, fish hook is not reported.Fish hook effect appears to be repeatable where it was studied. However, the conditions of reproducibility are to be specified by the proponents, if the phenomenon is to find general acceptance. It is likely that fish hook would continue to be regarded as a placebo. Its exclusion in simulation models does not appear to affect cyclone performance prediction.",

High reactive pozzolanic addition was obtained as a result of a number of physicochemical changes induced by milling, namely particle size reduction, specific surface area increase, amorphization/dehydroxylation of kaolinite phase and homogenization of clay constituents. The main characteristics of the pozzolanic material obtained after 1200\u00a0min of milling were: median particle size of 6.35\u00a0\u03bcm, specific surface area of 21.75\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01, total pore volume of 0.0580\u00a0cm3\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01, pozzolanic activity (compressive strength) of 14\u00a0MPa, and reactive silica content of 33.3\u00a0wt.%.

In comparison with the conventional slurry tailings disposal, SPD could offer operational and environmental advantages, such as a better water management, no need for complex retaining dams, a reduced footprint of the tailings disposal area, and the possibility to use progressive reclamation. This paper describes a field investigation through a large-scale experimental cell to assess an SPD application for sulphidic mine tailings. The work addresses the effect of two disposal configurations (i.e., partially cemented and un-cemented) on their hydrogeological behaviour when submitted to actual climatic conditions, focusing mainly on the implementation challenges as well as on the first results obtained. Tailings were deposited in thin layers (10 layers of 10\u00a0cm each one) into two experimental cells (D\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0L\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0H\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0m).

The evolution of volumetric water content \u0472, suction \u03c8, oxygen consumption and cracks for each cell was monitored during and after deposition. Results show that the CC provides slightly higher \u0472 and smaller \u03c8 values than the UC, most likely due to its geological properties dictated by the bottom cemented layer.",

The morphology and chemical composition of the calcination products were analysed by using scanning electronic microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM/EDS).

     "abstract": "Estimating the head grades from the ore feeding a processing plant is not a trivial task and is a continuing source of controversy in the mining industry. Grades determined as part of short-term mine planning are frequently not reproduced by sampling the continuous flow of ore at the plant. Head grades are normally obtained by sampling the continuous flow periodically during a day or shift and taking the average of the multiple samples collected. The standard error of this mean grade depends on the ore variability and the frequency (number) of samples. The more samples that are taken, the higher the precision of the calculated mean. Variographic experiments are normally used to map grade variability during a certain period of time, and the extension variance is derived from this variogram. This approach is time-consuming, expensive, and cumbersome, and therefore its use is often avoided in the mining industry. Additionally, a temporal variogram can vary as different ores are mined during the lifetime of the mine. This paper investigates a novel approach based on simulating the grades of orefeeding the processing plant. In situ three-dimensional grade models are constructed using geostatistical simulations. Grade spatial continuity and variability are reproduced in models with the same characteristics of the real deposit. These models are used in mine planning and scheduling, transforming a three-dimensional block model into a one-dimensional string of values feeding the plant (one-dimensional flow). The grades thus obtained have the statistical characteristics of the unknown real grades and can be sampled to simulate a variographic experiment. The results of this study showed consistency and provided satisfactory estimates of the sampling error for various sampling intervals using the simulated grades. They also showed that a variographic experiment can change significantly from time to time as the ore changes and that a selected sampling protocol can become obsolete if not adjusted for ore variability.",

     "publication date": "09-2014",
     "abstract": "In recent years, leaching of refractory gold ores has received much attention due to the depletion of oxide ores. Since the gold is usually associated with or encapsulated in sulfide minerals, such as pyrite, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite, research in this field has focused mainly on these phases. However, the main sulfide mineral in Zarshouran gold mine (Iran) is orpiment, which has received very little attention. In this study, the effect of different additives on the thiosulfate leaching of gold from Zarshouran refractory gold mine (high-grade orpiment) has been investigated, by determining the thiosulfate and arsenic concentration in solution using UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer and the copper and gold ions using atomic absorption.The results indicated that gold recovery in the presence of EDTA is higher than that achieved in the presence of ammonia, which is attributed to the stronger stabilization of Cu (II) and, consequently, the decrease in thiosulfate consumption. Increasing the copper concentration (greater than 0.05\u00a0mol/L) decreases the gold recovery, probably due to the increase in the solution potential, which causes higher thiosulfate consumption and, consequently, greater instability of the gold complexes. Although increasing the pH (mainly) and potential enhancement of the orpiment oxidation liberating the gold from the mineral, this also promotes copper and thiosulfate oxidations, which increase copper sulfide and copper oxide precipitation. Consequently, these actions decrease the gold dissolution (to less than 30%) by passivation of the gold surface. The maximum recovery achieved was 71%, with pH\u00a0=\u00a011, thiosulfate (0.5\u00a0mol/L), copper (II) (0.05\u00a0mol/L), EDTA (0.05\u00a0mol/L), after 24\u00a0h with no oxygen injection.",

When the 60\u00a0wt.% KOH solution was used to decompose chromite ore, the chromium and iron ions in chromite ore were oxidized into soluble K2CrO4 crystal and insoluble KFe3O5 particle, respectively. The chromium levels in the new residue meet the emission standard of chromium-containing waste due to the KFe3O5 crystal's compact appearance, hence the pollution problem of chromite ore process residue is thoroughly resolved. The effect of the main variables on this clean metallurgical process was systematically investigated.

The resistances of oxygen transport during the leaching process were calculated step by step, and the surface chemical reaction was the main resistance factor that was consistent with the kinetics study.",

A multi-step aqueous process is described for the fractional precipitation of magnesium carbonate and other minerals in an aqueous system at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. With the aim to achieve higher purity and deliver more valuable mineral products, the process was split into four steps. The first step consists of Mg leaching from the magnesium silicate in a stirred vessel using 1\u00a0M HCl at 80\u00a0\u00b0C, followed by a three step precipitation in reactors in sequence to remove Fe(OH)3, then Fe(OH)2 and other divalent ions, and finally MgCO3 nucleation and growth. Hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3\u22193H2O, nesquehonite] crystals were confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) as final products. The optimal pH of precipitation reactors based on the maximum solid purity and production was determined by carrying out detailed mass balance. The maximum productivity and highest purity for nesquehonite were found to be dependent on pH values for the two last steps. The results also demonstrated that the process is optimized at pH\u00a09 and 10 for the second and third step of precipitation, respectively. The highest carbonation efficiency expressed as the conversion of Mg ions to magnesium carbonate reached 82.5 wt %. The maximum magnesium content in the final product was 99.21 wt % of MgO when the second precipitation reactor pH was equal to 9. This experimental study demonstrates that carbon dioxide sequestration requires at least 3.74 times the weight of ore to provide the Mg for mineral production. This confirms the possibility to use this process route for CO2 mitigation.",

The baking experiments in the temperature range of 170\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C over 1\u20134\u00a0h revealed almost complete Cu and As extraction after 4\u00a0h baking at 200\u00a0\u00b0C, a sulfuric acid to enargite weight ratio (S/E) of 4, nitrogen flow rate ~\u00a0100\u00a0mL/min, and particle size P100\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a045\u00a0\u03bcm, and no arsenic was lost to the gas phase.

It is expected that these cracks are formed as a result of a major volume increase during the baking reaction. High nitrogen flow rates encouraged arsenic loss to the gas phase. Decreasing the S/E ratio from 4 to 2 resulted in a decrease in the rate of reaction, while increasing sulfuric acid concentration enhanced the rate. Excess sulfuric acid was found to be necessary for both acceptable reaction rates and also for maximum As retention in the condensed phase. Doubling the reaction surface area did not affect the extraction of Cu and As.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents a study of a thermal breakage process used to analyse the thermal stress and crack development that occur when rock is exposed to short-pulse microwave energy. A two-dimensional circular plate, containing two-phase minerals, was used in finite element simulation to calculate thermal stress for the purpose of better understanding thermal fracture behaviour in comminution. It is found that the thermal mismatch between a microwave-absorbing inclusion and a low-absorbing matrix mineral can generate large localized thermal stresses around the inclusion. Fracture initially occurs, not around the grain boundaries between the two minerals, but some distance away, as a result of thermal expansion stress on the matrix mineral. The results also indicate that though grain size is one of the factors causing cracks during heating of granular materials, it is not the only reason. The size and the thermal properties of the matrix mineral can also affect the results of thermal stresses.",

Calcined colloidal pyrite (CCPy) was prepared by calcining natural colloidal pyrite mineral in a N2 atmosphere. Cu2\u00a0+ removal from aqueous solutions by using iron sulfides was investigated with fixed-bed column experiments. Results show that CCPy was much more efficient in Cu2\u00a0+ removal than other three iron sulfide sorbents (natural pyrite, colloidal pyrite, and pyrrhotite). When the influent Cu2\u00a0+ concentration was 1.56\u00a0mmol/L and Cu2\u00a0+ breakthrough concentration was 0.0078\u00a0mmol/L, the throughput volume of the CCPy column was up to 1672 bed volumes (BV); the sorption amount at breakthrough was 84\u00a0mg\u00a0Cu/g CCPy. The maximum Cu content in the used CCPy sorbent was up to 20%, which is much higher than the grades of industrial Cu ore (0.4\u20132.8%), indicating that CCPy can be used as an effective sorbent for the recovery of Cu2\u00a0+ from wastewater. Copper specification analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that Cu removal by CCPy was mainly due to the formation of covellite on the CCPy's surface. The CCPy sorbent has advantages over chemical precipitation and other sorbents due to the recovery of Cu from wastewater, cheap raw material for manufacturing this sorbent, and prevention of hazardous sludge generation.",

The precipitation behavior of sulfate during the leaching process was also investigated at different temperatures up to 200\u00a0\u00b0C, showing that the sulfate precipitated in the silicon-rich phase at higher temperatures, while the main phase of the sulfate was chromium sulfate, coinciding with results reported by other researchers.

The spinel phase of the ore shrank while the extraction yield of chromium increased with the duration of the leaching, leveling out after 60\u00a0min. A porous amorphous silica phase was obtained as the metal elements leached and the spinel phase flaked, creating a resistance for the dissolution of the inner spinel phase.

However, grinding the quartz in a porcelain mill or co-grinding it with the hematite fines in a quartz mill resulted in non-selective flocculation due to cross-contamination of the quartz particles by coating of impurities from the porcelain or from hematite.

     "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of different grinding processes on the preg-robbing behavior of quartz. The adsorption of gold onto the quartz surface in a chloride medium is determined after grinding in a ball mill with steel media, and in a ring mill. The mechanical activation of the ground quartz is significantly influenced by the type of mechanical action in the mill; the compression\u2013shear action of the ring mill seems to be more effective than the impact\u2013attrition action in a ball mill. As a result, the grinding limit is lower in the ball mill, and agglomeration is not significant after the grinding limit. Grinding yields significant propensity towards adsorption of gold chloride complexes from solution, firstly due to an increase in surface area in material treated in both the ball and ring mills, and secondly due to the activation of the quartz surface, which mainly takes place in the ring mill. The preg-robbing of gold on the ground quartz was measured to be as high as 0.38\u00a0\u03bcmol/m2 on the ring milled quartz, while the corresponding value did not exceed 0.15\u00a0\u03bcmol/m2 after 360\u00a0min of ball milling. The rate of preg-robbing in ball milled products is also slower compared to that of the ring milled products, indicating geometrical or steric constraints on accessibility of the distorted (defect) quartz sites to gold complexes sorbing from the solution, which is consistent with the existing understanding of the different defect site locations induced by these two different grinding mechanisms.",

Therefore the combined use of PAM and KEX rendered the flotation of the two minerals selective.In the flotation of mixtures of the two minerals, galena and chalcopyrite could be separated by PAM and KEX only after EDTA treatment of the mineral mixtures. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometric (ToF-SIMS) measurements indicated that when galena and chalcopyrite were present together in the suspension, PAM adsorbed on both galena and chalcopyrite.

Rather, principal component analysis (PCA) of time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) reveals that chemically altered surface species interfere with the selectivity and recovery of froth flotation indicating that there is some poisoning of galena mineral surfaces particularly with Fe-containing species possibly leading to loss of recovery. Analysis of the Pb-circuit cleaner tails indicates Pb-species association with sphalerite surfaces, as was observed for the flotation feed and rougher tails but with insufficient induced hydrophobicity by Pb\u2013collector interaction for flotation. A small population of relatively clean galena surfaces is also observed which may result from low bubble\u2013particle collision efficiency or insufficient liberation.Fine-grained framboidal pyrite is the main diluting phase in the cleaner concentrate and is likely present due to entrainment. The presence of framboidal pyrite in CGO is of particular significance as its large surface area increases the rate of galvanic interaction with other metal sulfide minerals. We propose that increased abundance of refractory framboidal pyrite in CGO is the critical factor affecting the performance of the Navan Pb flotation circuit rather than purely high pyrite abundance.",

The premise of the study was that Cu-bearing phases may be selectively solubilized through bioleaching from the bulk molybdenite for subsequent recovery from the leach solution. The composition of mineral salts in bioleach solutions was evaluated, but it did not have significant effects on the bioleaching. The addition of pyrite or a combination of sulfur and ferrous sulfate increased the redox potential and acid formation but did not have a major effect on the bioleaching of Cu. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences in the bioleaching of copper between eight different mineral salt formulations amended with sulfur and ferrous iron. Silver at 69\u00a0mg/l (added as Ag2SO4) enhanced the dissolution of chalcopyrite. The bioleaching of the molybdenite concentrate at 3% (w/v) pulp density yielded 97% dissolution of Cu in the presence and 55% in the absence of added Ag. Bioleaching at thermophilic temperatures (70\u00a0\u00b0C) yielded up to 75% Cu dissolution from the concentrate at 6% (w/v) pulp density, whereas the yields were about 27% at mesophilic temperatures. On a mass basis, molybdenum dissolution exceeded copper leaching but the relative yields were <\u00a09%. If the molybdenite concentrate is upgraded by removing Cu through bioleaching, molybdenum loss into solution may be offset by recovering it from leach solutions.",

In the present study, we report our investigation on the effect of Li salts on the synthesis and dissolution properties of Na2PtO3, a cost-effective Pt-group metal complex oxide alternative to Li2PtO3. The addition of a small amount of Li2CO3 drastically accelerates the formation of Na2PtO3, allowing for synthesis of the complex oxide under milder conditions.

The vanadium leaching efficiency in direct acid leaching process was 92.39% while in blank roasting acid leaching process was 85.43% under the comparative leaching condition of 15% (v/v) H2SO4, 1\u00a0mL/g, 4\u00a0h, 95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% (w/w) CaF2. In essence, the mechanism of vanadium leaching was similar in direct acid leaching process and blank roasting acid leaching process. First, calcium fluoride reacted with sulfuric acid to generate hydrofluoric acid. Second, the hydrofluoric acid thoroughly broke down silicoaluminate minerals due to the generation of [SiF6]2\u00a0\u2212 and [AlF5]2\u00a0\u2212 . However, the difference was that blank roasting contributed to changes in the minerals. On the one hand, blank roasting benefited the vanadium leaching because it transformed vanadium (bound to organics) into vanadium (bound to free oxides) and broke vanadium-bearing silicoaluminate minerals down. On the other hand, it also transformed pyrite into acid-consuming hematite, which increased the consumption of hydrofluoric acid. It was the generation of hematite covering the benefits from blank roasting that decreased the leaching efficiency of vanadium. It was reasonable for this stone coal where vanadium and iron mainly existed in forms of silicoaluminate and pyrite respectively to adopt direct acid leaching process with calcium fluoride.",

The average As loss to the gas phase corresponding to the indicated operating conditions was ~\u00a05.9%. Characterization of the baked concentrate indicated the formation of S8, As2O3, HFe(SO4)2\u00b74H2O, and Cu0.47Fe0.53SO4\u00b7H2O as a result of baking, identical to the phases formed upon sulfuric acid baking of the concentrate in a muffle furnace. The fact that no secondary copper sulfides were found to form around the enargite particles indicates that most probably enargite directly transformed to copper sulfate. The variation of temperature in the range 180\u2013220\u00a0\u00b0C did not affect the extraction of Cu and Fe significantly, but As extraction decreased from ~\u00a065.2% to ~\u00a052.5%, owing to a systematic arsenic loss from ~\u00a03.7% at 190\u00a0\u00b0C to ~\u00a010.9% at 220\u00a0\u00b0C. Increasing the nitrogen flow rate from 340\u00a0mL/min to 1049\u00a0mL/min did not influence the extraction of Cu, As, and Fe upon water leaching. Sulfuric acid dosage had the greatest effect on the extraction of metals. Sulfuric acid to concentrate (S/C) weight ratios in the range 1.0\u20132.3 at a constant baking temperature of 200\u00a0\u00b0C over 6\u00a0h resulted in a steady increase of metals extraction from 52.6% to 82.2% for Cu, from 40.6% to 68.0% for As, and from 22.8% to 62.1% for Fe. No arsenic loss to the gas phase was observed when the highest S/C ratio (2.3) was used.",

     "abstract": "Based upon the information obtained from the sulfuric acid baking of an enargite concentrate, a second series of experiments were performed using a high-quality enargite powder. The results obtained from the sulfuric acid baking of high-quality enargite provided significant insights towards a more rigorous plan of attack in identifying the meaningful range of parameters and perhaps the time and temperature range in which the rate of the baking reaction should be studied. Hence, the effects of baking time, baking temperature, sulfuric acid dosage, nitrogen flow rate, and particle size on the water extraction of copper and arsenic were studied, as well as the mineralogical transformations associated with sulfuric acid baking. It was found that baking of enargite for extended times at a temperature of 200\u00a0\u00b0C had no effect on the extraction of Cu and As, which leveled off at ~\u00a073.7% and ~\u00a059.4%, respectively. Arsenic loss to the gas phase corresponding to 7\u00a0h of baking was found to be ~\u00a010.4%. Increasing the baking temperature in the range of 200\u2013260\u00a0\u00b0C at a constant time of 6\u00a0h had no beneficial effect, but it adversely increased the arsenic loss to ~\u00a054.7% at 260\u00a0\u00b0C. Increasing the nitrogen flow rate in the range of 163\u2013813\u00a0mL/min at a constant baking temperature of 200\u00a0\u00b0C for extended times slightly increased the arsenic loss. Under identical baking conditions, sulfuric acid dosage had the greatest effect on the extraction of Cu and As, with effective extraction levels being achieved at a sulfuric acid to enargite weight ratio of about 3.7. No systematic effect of particle size was observed on the extraction of Cu and As from enargite. Upon sulfuric acid baking, enargite transformed into CuSO4, CuO\u00b7CuSO4, As2O3, and S8, all of which, except S8, are soluble in water. Based on the experimental results, the following reaction is suggested for the sulfuric acid baking of enargite: 4Cu3AsS4\u00a0+\u00a051H2SO4\u00a0=\u00a03CuO\u00b7CuSO4\u00a0+\u00a06CuSO4\u00a0+\u00a02As2O3\u00a0+\u00a051H2O\u00a0+\u00a054SO2 (g)\u00a0+\u00a04S",

Batch flotation tests of artificial mixtures composed of sericite and microcrystalline graphite were also carried out. The results indicated that the particle size and concentration of hydrophobic graphite significantly affected the recovery of water, the entrainment factor of sericite, and the recovery of sericite in concentrate. The serious entrainment or entrapment of sericite in the presence of hydrophobic microcrystalline graphite leads to poor selectivity in microcrystalline graphite ore flotation.",

The factors investigated included: acid concentration, leaching time, temperature and solid to liquid ratio. The significance of each factor and associated interactive effects were evaluated using a two-level factorial statistical design (24) in conjunction with statistical software based on quadratic programming. Results showed temperature and time to be statistically significant; other factors and interactive effects were found to be insignificant. Optimization of the two significant factors was achieved by employing the second order quadratic regression model in combination with the central composite rotatable design (CCRD).From the prediction model, an optimal aluminium extraction efficiency of 23.95% was obtained at optimal values of 82\u00a0\u00b0C temperature and 10.2\u00a0h leaching time. A confirmatory test showed an aluminium extraction efficiency of 24.8%, giving an error margin of 3.4%, with a linear correlation coefficient of 97.8%, hence verifying the fitness of the model and experimental data.

The experimental idea was to sample the same batch of bubbles at their formation point and later, during the bubble rise in static and dynamic conditions. The difference in the measured bubble size in the two sampling areas gives indication on the effect of frothers on bubble coalescence and breakup that takes place after the bubble creation due to the dynamic conditions.Three commercial frothers, DF200, NF240 and DF250, were tested in the experiments.In static conditions, the size of the forming and rising bubbles became equal at the frother concentration equal to the critical coalescence concentration (CCC) observed previously in mechanical flotation cell. On the other hand, in dynamic conditions, the size of rising bubbles was significantly larger than the size of freshly formed bubbles not only below the CCC as expected based on the literature. This finding confirms the hypothesis that the CCC is only applicable in static conditions, or in conditions where hydrodynamic forces do not contribute to bubble coalescence or breakup. The results showed that the frothers have a major effect on bubble size already at the early stage of bubble formation.",

Separability studies were conducted in a Partridge\u2013Smith cell using dextrin as a molybdenite depressant in solution at different concentrations and pH values to produce a technical-grade concentrate (i.e., 90% MoS2). These basic studies were accompanied by measurements of the zeta potential and contact angle, which was determined by the capillary rise method. The results of these floatability studies were used in bench tests of flotation, which were performed in a Denver D-12 cell.

Enargite Cu3AsS4 contains dangerous arsenic, and this element can be removed by leaching with Na2S in very alkaline environment (pH\u00a0>\u00a012.5). Arsenic passes into the leach, while the copper sulfide produced represents a raw material suitable for pyrometallurgy. We have shown that more than 80% of the arsenic can be extracted by atmospheric alkaline leaching at 95\u00a0\u00b0C, when mechanical pretreatment of enargite concentrate in an attritor is applied. The solubilized arsenic can be transformed into solid Na3AsS4. The solid product Cu2S can be further treated with elemental iron by mechanochemical reduction in a planetary mill. The final product forms a Cu/FeS composite from which iron can be separated by leaching with HCl. The proposed two-step process of milling (enhancement of arsenic removal (I) and obtaining of elemental copper (II)) illustrates the principal possibility of transforming minerals into metals.",

The samples studied are from Sudbury and Timmins areas and differ in their mafic and ultramafic associations and degree of dissemination. It has been shown that the pentlandite in the Timmins ore is completely depressed in the lime system at a collector dosage that readily floats the pentlandite in the Sudbury ore. The general mechanism of pentlandite depression by lime is believed to be similar to that of pyrite. However, the sensitivity of pentlandite in the Timmins ore is greatly affected by its ultramafic associations and is likely related to slime coating by serpentine minerals. The tenacity of hydrophilic calcium species in the case of the Sudbury ore is believed to be counteracted by a greater activation potential (e.g., level of Cu/Ni) and collector action. When lime is replaced by soda ash, adverse effect induced by adsorbed calcium species on pentlandite is largely eliminated. Benefit resulting from better dispersion of serpentinized species in the Timmins ore is also observed using soda ash. Chalcopyrite's strong floatability overcomes difficulties experienced by pentlandite and floats well both in the lime and soda ash systems. Pyrrhotite is less floatable than chalcopyrite and pentlandite in both lime and soda ash systems. In the lime system, pyrite depression is almost the same as pentlandite depression, but unlike pentlandite it continues to be non-floatable even in the soda ash system.",

The X-ray diffracting peaks of dolomite and other accessory minerals (talc, quartz and biotite) present in the limestone decreased with prolonged grinding.

It is discussed that the method, when part of a variability study, can be used as a convenient tool for geometallurgical mapping of ore deposits regarding ore breakage response.",

From this leach liquor, Fe was first precipitated out with Ca(OH)2 at pH\u00a03.8 followed by the extraction of copper using LIX 84I. From the almost Fe- and Cu-free leach liquor, Zn was extracted out as an impurity with D2EHPA in kerosene, after which the extraction of Mn was carried out with NaD2EHPA. The extraction efficiency of manganese using NaD2EHPA was 99.93% in 2-stages at A:O ratio of 3:4. The co-extraction of cobalt with manganese was 43\u00a0mg/L which was subsequently removed by scrubbing in two stages with MnSO4 solution. The stripping of manganese was achieved with 4% H2SO4 in 2-stages at A:O ratio of 1:1. After extraction of Mn, Ni was extracted with NaD2EHPA. The extraction isotherm of nickel reads 2-stages at A:O ratio of 3:2. The co-extraction of cobalt with nickel was 47\u00a0mg/L for which the Ni-LO was scrubbed out with NiSO4 solution.

The kinetics of the leaching process for the rare earth metals was explained using the shrinking core model. Then, the selective titration of Fe(OH)3 precipitates was determined from the pH-log[Mn\u00a0+] diagram. The ionic conductivity of the obtained metallic-TFSA melts obeyed the Arrhenius law and the Vogel\u2013Tamman\u2013Fulcher (VTF) parameters were estimated from empirical data. For the electrodeposition process, the reduction behavior of Nd in the metallic-TFSA melts was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, and it was also studied under the potentiostatic condition of \u2212\u00a03.2\u00a0V at 493\u00a0K. The deeper layer of the electrodeposits consisted mainly of Nd metal, which was confirmed by XPS. The oxygen content decreased to less than 0.1% at a depth of 1.0\u00a0\u03bcm. Thus, the series of recycling processes developed here enabled Fe in VCMs to be selectively removed by wet separation and metallic Nd to be efficiently recovered by electrodeposition.",

     "abstract": "Pellet properties are largely governed by the form and degree of bonding achieved between ore particles during induration and the stability of these bonding phases during reduction. Fluxing agents play an important role in forming these bonds by forming different phases depending on the type of flux. In the present study, effect of different fluxing agents, viz., limestone, magnesite and pyroxenite, on melt formation & microstructure during the induration and on swelling behavior during reduction, was examined. Optical microstructural studies with image analysis were carried out to estimate the amount of different phases. SEM-EDS analysis was done to measure the chemical analysis of oxide and slag phases. X-ray mapping was also carried out to understand the distribution of CaO, MgO, SiO2 and Al2O3 in different phases. From the results, it was observed that limestone addition decreased the swelling at lower basicity but exhibited highest swelling at 0.6 basicity and decreased thereafter. Formation of low melting point calcium olivines between Fe2SiO4 and Ca2SiO4 can be attributed to the highest swelling at 0.6 basicity. With increasing addition of magnesite and pyroxenite, pellet swelling found to be decreased considerably. Formation of magnesioferrite phase and high melting point slag formed during induration could be attributed to the improved swelling of magnesite and pyroxenite fluxed pellets. Limestone fluxed pellets at 0.8 basicity, pyroxenite fluxed pellets at 1.5% MgO and magnesite fluxed pellets at 1.0% MgO exhibited low swelling behavior among all the pellets studied.",

     "abstract": "It is customary to use more than one stage of flotation to obtain an acceptable level of separation of valuables. Flotation circuit design is usually accomplished by applying empirical rules or by using expertise of practitioners which may result in operations not working at their optimum conditions. Given the capabilities of genetic algorithms (GA) in finding an optimum solution in very disturbed search spaces, they can be used to obtain the desired flotation circuit configuration. In flotation circuit configuration optimization problem, a combination of metallurgical parameters such as yield and concentrate ash content could be used as the fitness function for the genetic algorithm. The multi-objective nature of the problem justified the use of the Pareto method to arrive at a set of solutions. The appropriate configuration based on technical or economic considerations could then be chosen. To obtain the fitness function for any given configuration, it is necessary to model every flotation stage. The proposed method was used to find the optimum circuit configuration for a coal washing plant. The objective was to arrive at the highest yield while producing a concentrate with a certain ash content (11.2%). The feed to the flotation circuit was characterized based on the size fractions and their flotation rate constants. Results showed that with a 95% confidence the absolute difference between the modeled and measured values were 2.9\u20135.5% for yield and 0.4\u20131.1% for concentrate ash content. When the proposed GA-based circuit configuration was implemented in the plant, the yield increased from the original value of 57.6% to 64.3% while producing concentrate ash content (10.9%) within acceptable limits. By adding one stage to the current three-stage circuit, it was predicted that the yield could be further increased by 3.8% while keeping the quality of the concentrate within the appropriate level.",

     "publication date": "01-2014",
     "abstract": "Eight oil sands ores were tested in order to quantify the levels of humic acids in these samples through the alkali extraction test originally developed to determine the oxidation of bituminous metallurgical coals. The test gives a concentration of humic acids released from ores, which in combination with the measurement of the total organic carbon (TOC) content in the alkali extracts provides a measure of ore/bitumen weathering. It was found that poor ores (low bitumen and high fines contents) exhibited the highest tendency to leach large amounts of humic acids per gram of bitumen in the samples. It was also shown that the absorbance at 520\u00a0nm obtained from the UV/visible spectra of the alkali extracted solutions correlated very well with the quality of the ores, with the highest absorbance obtained from the extracts produced by the poor ores. A comparison between the UV/Visible spectra of solutions obtained from the alkali-extraction tests and spectra of solutions of commercial humic acids also indicated that the total organic carbon content of the extracts of good ores primarily originated from compounds other than humic acids while the organic matter released by poor ores was dominated by humic acids.The results of contact angle measurements on fresh and oxidized bitumen samples indicated that contact angles decreased and bitumen became more hydrophilic as pH increased. It was also shown that the hydrophobicity of bitumen drastically decreased when the sample was artificially oxidized, although the amount of humic acids generated in bitumen during the oxidation process was small. Additionally, the effect of added humic acids on the wettability of bitumen was also evaluated. It was found that the contact angle of bitumen significantly decreased in the presence of humic acids at pH\u00a03, but the effect of humic acids was not significant at higher pH values (7 and 10). At pH\u00a07 the effect of humic acids on bitumen wettability was minor compared to the effect of artificial oxidation of bitumen. These results suggest that humic acids make bitumen hydrophilic if they are part of internal/surface bitumen structure. However, if they are added as free chemicals their effect is minor, particularly under neutral and alkaline pH conditions, which also indicates that adsorption of humic acids from solution onto bitumen is low.",

     "abstract": "The processability of four oil sand ores was evaluated through batch flotation experiments under different conditions of pH and temperature. The data of bitumen recovery were accurately modeled using a first-order kinetic equation assuming that the total amount of bitumen in the system consisted of two bitumen components, i.e., a fully-liberated bitumen fraction, f, characterized by a high flotation rate constant (kf), and poorly-liberated bitumen fraction, s, of a low flotation rate constant (ks) so that f\u00a0+\u00a0s\u00a0=\u00a01. The role of humic acids naturally present in the ores was basically that of a depressant of bitumen since poor ores contained the highest proportion of humic acids per gram of bitumen. The recovery of bitumen from oil sand ores correlated very well with the absorbance at 520\u00a0nm of the alkali extracts produced from the ores. High bitumen recovery was achieved for ores characterized by a low absorbance value of the extract, while low bitumen recoveries were obtained for ores producing a high absorbance value in the alkali extraction test.Power draw measurements ahead of the bitumen flotation/extraction stage showed that power drawn by slurries of poor processing ores was not affected by pH and temperature, which was attributed to the low amount of bitumen and low degree of bitumen liberation in these ores. In contrast, good ores required more power for mixing under conditions of low pH and low temperature than under conditions of high pH and high temperature. Gradual bitumen liberation at higher temperature and pH improved the dispersion of the slurries and led to lower power requirements for mixing. Additionally, extraction data indicated that bitumen recovery was proportional to the power draw measured during feed conditioning. Poor ores produced slurries of lower viscosities than slurries prepared from good ores. As a result, higher power consumption was required during conditioning of good ores to promote bitumen liberation and to increase bitumen recovery.Overall, it is possible to assess the processability of oil sand ores by quantifying the occurrence of humic acids in the ores, and to correlate ore processability with the rheology of ore slurries. Although poor ores are characterized by lower viscosities and lower power requirements during mixing, the presence of humic acids in these ores and their depressing action also contribute to lower bitumen recoveries.",

However, the increase in the rate of copper extraction was insignificant, increasing this only from 3.8% to 4.0% in 30\u00a0days. The observed precipitates were mostly of type Fe-sulfates, with minor appearance of jarosite. In neither case, QEMSCAN analysis revealed formation of elemental sulfur on the mineral. Consequently, the inoculation of sulfur oxidizing bacterium A. thiooxidans in a controlled precipitation system produced no improvement in the extraction of copper.The leaching behavior fitted with the model of SCM (shrinking core model), indicating the formation of a layer of undetected compounds which exerts an effect on the diffusion of the leaching agent. Therefore, none of the options taken to avoid the passivation of chalcopyrite were successful, indicating that passivation occurs even in the absence of iron precipitation and the presence of sulfur oxidizing bacteria.",

     "abstract": "In order to develop a dry separation tool for low-grade middling ores with high economic feasibility, a novel rotating drum separator covered with an elastic material was designed. The operational principle was based on the simple notion that the differences in the physical properties of ores, such as their shape and chemical composition, should result in different rebounding distances. When ores slide down the drum and rebound from the drum surface, the friction coefficient and repulsion coefficient of the ores affect their collisions with the drum surface, and thus determine their rebounding distances. The basic performance of the elastic drum separator was examined for selected sample ores, including coal, shale, talc, and dolomite. The calculated and experimentally determined rebounding distances were found to be in good agreement for all of the ores. Tests on a 1:1 talc/dolomite mixture showed good performance for the separation of talc from dolomite. It was also found that the shape anisotropy of the ores played an important factor in determining the rebounding distance. The separation of low-grade coal middling dumped at a mine confirmed the performance of the elastic drum. A total of 46.5\u00a0wt.% of coal ore with a calorie content of 4991\u00a0cal/g was recovered from 45 to 65\u00a0mm sized coal ores with an average calorie content of 3576\u00a0cal/g. In addition, 35.4\u00a0wt.% of coal ore with a calorie content of 3105\u00a0cal/g was recovered from 25 to 45\u00a0mm-sized ore that had an average calorie content of 1554\u00a0cal/g.

Following this, the importance of controlling the residence time of the mill optimally was appreciated.Initial findings showed that milling conditions should be tailored to the desired product size requirements. The lower and upper limits in which the maximum production of fines should lie were also identified.

Using a 2D laser range finder, the spatial data of a stockpile, such as the positions of different layers, the cutting surfaces during the reclaiming are represented by mathematical equations. Experiments conducted in a laboratory environment indicated good results and proved that the modelling approach is accurate and efficient. By making available the latest shapes of stockpiles and quality information, it is possible to predict the tonnage and quality grade with a greater degree of accuracy. Also, together with the reclaimer position data, it is possible to develop adaptive reclaiming algorithms to continually adjust the quality with respect to the quality requirement, which warrants meeting the required quantity and quality while enhancing the export efficiency and increasing productivity.",

     "abstract": "Formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an oxidizing agent stronger than oxygen, by sphalerite ((Zn, Fe) S) was examined during its grinding process. It was observed that sphalerite generated H2O2 in pulp liquid during wet grinding and also when the freshly ground solids placed in water immediately after dry grinding. The generation of H2O2 in either wet or dry grinding was thought to be due to a reaction between sphalerite and water where the mineral surface is catalytically active to produce OH free radicals by breaking down the water molecule. Effect of pH on the formation of H2O2 by sphalerite showed that acidic pH values generated more H2O2. Mixtures of pyrite, chalcopyrite and galena with sphalerite on the formation of H2O2 were also probed. It was shown that the concentration of H2O2 increases with increasing pyrite or chalcopyrite fraction in pyrite\u2013sphalerite or chalcopyrite\u2013sphalerite or galena\u2013sphalerite mixtures but with an increase in galena proportion, the concentration of H2O2 decreased. The oxidation or dissolution of one mineral than the other in a mixture can also be accounted with the extent of H2O2 formation in the pulp liquid in addition to galvanic interactions. H2O2 plays a greater role in the oxidation of sulfides or aiding the extensively reported galvanic interactions since the amount of H2O2 generated with a specific mineral followed the rest potential series of sulfide minerals. This study highlights the necessity of relooking into the role of H2O2 in electrochemical and/or galvanic interaction mechanisms between pyrite, chalcopyrite and galena with sphalerite.",

This provides a favorable fluidization environment for the stratification process of fine coal particles depending on their density difference. The main operational parameters including superficial air velocity, vibration frequency and amplitude, initial bed height and separating time all have significant influences on the stratification performance of the particulate bed of fine coal. The batch separation results of Wuhai fine coal in an autogenous medium vibrated fluidized bed show that the separation efficiency, i.e. the probable error E, is 0.14, indicating that dry beneficiation of fine coal using an autogenous medium vibrated fluidized bed is a promising technique for coal cleaning in dry regions.",

Bacterial cells were adapted to grow in the presence of the minerals and use of hematite-grown and kaolinite-grown cells and their metabolic products in the selective flocculation of hematite and dispersion of kaolinite illustrated. Bacterial cells and extracellular polysaccharides exhibited higher surface affinity towards hematite, rendering it hydrophilic; while significant protein adsorption enhanced surface hydrophobicity of kaolinite. Bacterial interaction with hematite and kaolinite resulted in significant surface chemical changes on the minerals. Due to higher surface affinity towards extracellular proteins, zeta potentials of kaolinite shifted in the positive direction, while those of hematite shifted in the negative direction due to higher adsorption of extracellular polysaccharides. Bacterial interaction promoted selective flocculation of only hematite, while kaolinite was efficiently dispersed. Mineral-specific stress proteins were generated on growing B. subtilis in the presence of kaolinite.

The goal of this study is to enhance slurry filtration by adding treated perlite during the phosphate rock digestion stage. This study was carried out using a semi-continuous laboratory scale unit simulating the dihydrate process conditions. Results showed that there was an optimum dose which depended on the type of perlite and it was 86 for raw perlite, 17.2 for calcinated perlite and 8.6\u00a0g/kg P2O5 for the activated perlite. The addition of activated perlite ensured high filtration and washing flows and high P2O5 yields through reducing the P2O5 losses especially the unattacked form which consequently improved plant productivity. Perlite proved to be a very effective additive for the growth of gypsum crystals it altered the morphology of the gypsum particles. Additional results indicated that the activated perlite led to decreasing the amount of fluorine (18.8%), aluminum (18.9%), iron (8.2%) and soluble organic matter (16.6%).

Pyrite was activated by copper ions during primary grinding, and the rougher flotation concentrate was reground in a tumbling mill prior to the cleaner flotation. The regrinding condition was manipulated by two types of grinding media, stainless steel and mild steel. It was found that pyrite flotation in the cleaner stage was depressed especially when mild steel media was used during regrinding. An additional amount of collector improved pyrite flotation especially when stainless steel media was used during regrinding. An additional amount of copper ions further increased pyrite flotation after regrinding with mild steel media but decreased pyrite flotation after regrinding with stainless steel media. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analyses and EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid) extraction revealed that the different response of pyrite flotation in the cleaner stage to stainless steel and mild steel media used during regrinding was associated with the modified property of the Cu-activated pyrite surface carried from the rougher flotation concentrate and the new pyrite surface created during regrinding.",

Western Australia and Queensland bauxite ores were carbothermally reduced in steps in argon.

For this work commercial frothers have been selected, MIBC, DF-250, DF-400 and DF-1012; and NaCl as inorganic electrolyte. Surface tension measurements used to characterize the tested frothers revealed that these frothers have quite different properties. Polypropylene glycols are much more surface active than MIBC. The differences between these two are further augmented in concentrated NaCl electrolyte solutions. The concept of the surface tension switch point (s.t.s.p.) is introduced to characterize the effect of electrolyte concentration on frother properties. The s.t.s.p. values for MIBC and DF-250 were determined to be around 120\u00a0ppm and 1.2\u00a0ppm, respectively. The effect of MIBC and DF-250 frothers on bubble coalescence was not very different, although finer bubbles were generated in the presence of MIBC than of DF-250 in seawater. Only dynamics foamability measurements (DFI) confirmed the differences, the foams produced in the presence of DF-250 were much more stable, also in electrolyte solutions.

Additionally, the coarse cores of minerals were closely surrounded and adhered by a matrix of fine minerals. The chemical components were closely related to the particle sizes of constituent minerals. Based on these findings, a classification method was devised and three samples with different components were obtained under the proposed optimal scheme. About 50% of Mg and Si were removed from the fine fraction (S1) and more than 85% of Fe and Ni distributed in it. The other two samples are Co-riched and the content in the intermediate fraction (S2) and the coarse fraction (S3) was 0.22% and 0.28%, respectively. Cr in S2 was as high as 6.75%. A technical route was designed for processing these three samples and the preliminary tests indicate that the recoveries of Fe, Ni, Co and Cr can reach about 94%, 85%, 70% and 30%, respectively; Fe content in the prepared iron concentrate is over 61% and Cr content in the obtained Cr-riched residue is above 12%.

The tests were carried out in distilled water and in a dilute background electrolyte (0.01\u00a0mol/L sodium chloride). It was demonstrated that the raw viscosity data could accurately be described using the Fedors equation in order to obtain the intrinsic viscosity. Generally, the intrinsic viscosity increased with the degree of anionicity at any pH value although a plateau region was observed between degrees of anionicity of about 10% and 30%. It was also found that the ionic strength had a much more significant impact on the measured intrinsic viscosities than pH over the studied range of pH values (5.7\u201310.5). The results obtained in distilled water showed that temperature had a negligible effect on the intrinsic viscosity of any of the tested polymers, but a substantial decrease was observed at higher temperatures in the presence of sodium chloride for more anionic samples only. The data were discussed in terms of conformational changes of the flocculant chains. The background electrolyte primarily brought about coiling of the flocculant chains leading to a decrease in the intrinsic viscosity. It was also suggested that this main coiling effect promoted further intramolecular bonding for more anionic polymers at higher temperatures. An exceptional affinity of calcium ions towards anionic polyacrylamides was also demonstrated as even a small amount of calcium (0.001\u00a0mol/L) was sufficient to reduce the intrinsic viscosity to a value indicating a physical limit of coiling.",

The proposed process was composed of two hydrometallurgical steps; decopperization in H2SO4 medium and dissolution of selenium into NaOH solution. The effects of oxygen flow rate and solution temperature on the decopperization of anode slimes were examined in H2SO4 medium and copper recovery was achieved with an efficiency of 94%. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed Cu2Se as a remaining phase of copper in anode slimes after the decopperization process. Following the decopperization stage, anode slimes were treated with NaOH solution in order to dissolve selenium. The influences of NaOH concentration, temperature and various types of oxidants on selenium dissolution were inspected. The uniqueness of this technique is that it provides to have an efficiency of selenium recovery as high as 86.8% in an alkaline solution (4\u00a0M NaOH) under atmospheric conditions without requiring an autoclave.",

     "publication date": "11-2013",
     "abstract": "The polymer-bridging flocculation processes that take place in hydrometallurgical thickening are very much affected by the solid concentration at the point of flocculant dosing, with the optimum concentrations maximising settling flux often well below that of the thickener feed. This is a consequence of the open, low density aggregate structures formed by flocculation. Achieving adequate solids dilution in full-scale applications can be problematic, and a flocculant that can produce a denser aggregate and thereby reduce the extent of solids dilution required may offer practical advantages. There is evidence that Rheomax\u00ae DR 1050 (BASF) has such potential, although detailed quantification of this has not been previously published.The kinetics of flocculation of fine calcite slurries in turbulent pipe flow by Rheomax DR 1050 was contrasted against a conventional acrylamide/acrylate copolymer over a range of solid concentrations and dosages. Focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) was used to provide in-line monitoring of aggregate size as a function of reaction time, with batch sampling also producing corresponding settling rates. These reaction profiles confirmed distinct responses to solid concentration for the two flocculants; the conventional flocculant was superior in the range 20\u201340\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u2212\u00a03, while the optimum for Rheomax DR 1050 was near 60\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u2212\u00a03. Fitting of a population balance model to this kinetic data indicated that this behaviour primarily reflected a higher fractal dimension from flocculation with Rheomax DR 1050. The experimental results and model predictions are used to explore the practical scenarios under which Rheomax DR 1050 would be expected to perform best, showing that even at high solids, the benefit may only be realised in applications requiring higher dosages and mass throughputs. The practical limitations of the experimental approach used here to measure flocculation kinetics are also discussed.",

The results show that 1) The seepage flow of crushed gangues during compaction is nonlinear, and their compactability after compaction is related to their final porosity; 2) the seepage velocity of crushed gangues of same size decreases with pressure gradient increase and with porosity decrease, and varies less than that of crushed gangues of same porosity and mixed size or size between 10 and 15\u00a0mm. Moreover, the greater the single particle size is, the greater the pressure gradient. In addition, the mixed gangues have the lowest pressure gradient; 3) the permeability of gangues of same size decreases with their size increase and that of the mixed gangues is the largest; 4) the relationship of permeability to porosity can be divided into two stages with porosity decrease. At the stage II, permeability decreases significantly by the magnitude of 2 to 3 compared to that at the stage I. After stage II, the permeability of crushed gangue decreases to the magnitude of 10\u2212\u00a015\u00a0m2, while the impermeability increases; 5) the non-Darcy \u03b2 factor is negative for gangues with size larger than 10\u00a0mm, while that gradually becomes positive with porosity decrease for mixed gangues and gangues with size less than 10\u00a0mm. Moreover, non-Darcy\u03b2 factors affect the impermeability of gangues. The results will provide references for gangues as filling materials.",

In this paper, the original definition of P as the efficiency of collection was resurrected. Fundamental models of particle collection by bubbles were applied to an industrial data set from a down-the-bank flotation survey of the first four cells of the galena rougher circuit at BHP Billiton's Cannington operation in Australia. The floatability of mineral particles P was no longer treated as a lumped parameter but described by the physical measurable inputs of the models. Induction time as a model parameter was back-calculated from knowledge of the experimental data and application of the collection model. The assumption that the induction time of a size-by-liberation class at fixed chemistry was conserved allowed prediction of galena recoveries in the circuit. An extensive error analysis was conducted on the new modeling approach and it was found to be very sensitive to the value of the bubble rise velocity. Finally, since the variation in the key flotation variables down the bank at the BHP Billiton Cannington's lead rougher circuit was not significant, the two approaches predicted similar flotation kinetics down the bank.",

However, its high performance is limited to a narrow particle size range between approximately 50 to 600\u00a0\u03bcm for coal and 10 to 100\u00a0\u03bcm for minerals. Outside this range, the efficiency of froth flotation decreases significantly, especially for difficult-to-float particles of weak hydrophobicity (e.g., oxidized coal).This study was aimed at enhancing recovery of an Illinois fine coal sample using a specially designed flotation column featuring a hydrodynamic cavitation nanobubble generator. Nanobubbles that are mostly smaller than 1\u00a0\u03bcm can be formed selectively on hydrophobic coal particles from dissolved air in coal slurry. Results indicate that the combustible recovery of a \u2212\u00a0150\u00a0\u03bcm coal increased by 5\u201350% in the presence of nanobubbles, depending on process operating conditions. Nanobubbles also significantly improved process separation efficiency.

The presence of fluorite as a minor or an accessory mineral phase with chlorite may markedly exacerbate the pulp rheology and reduce the leaching dramatically. In the present work, isothermal leaching and rheological behaviours of chlorite were investigated in the presence of fluorite (chlorite/fluorite mass ratios of 20, 10 and 5 to 1) at pH\u00a01 and 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Fluorite was found to dramatically enhance the kinetics of chlorite leaching, the mechanism of which was incongruent. The leach dispersion rheology showed a distinctly non-Newtonian behaviour characterized by thixotropy, shear thinning and time and fluorite concentration-dependent shear yield stress. The highest, maximum shear yield stress and apparent viscosities were observed at chlorite/fluorite ratio of 10:1, below and above which weaker gels formed. Solution-state 27Al and 29Si NMR studies indicated that polycondensation reactions involving solution Al(III) six to four fold coordination and a plethora of Si(IV) tetrahedra complexes led to the formation of aluminosilicate gels. The chlorite/fluorite ratio had a striking impact on the formation and development of the strongly viscous gel structures. The findings suggest that the resulting maximum yield stresses (40\u2013200\u00a0Pa) and apparent viscosity (10\u201325\u00a0Pa\u00b7s) are highly detrimental to plant chlorite clay\u2013fluorite rich, low grade laterite ores' leaching and handling operations.",

The experimental results showed that sintering proceeded in three partly overlapping stages: (1) decomposition of zinnwaldite at temperature up to 800\u00a0\u00b0C, (2) formation of new phases in the temperature range between 750 and 835\u00a0\u00b0C, and (3) formation of amorphous glassy phase at temperature above 835\u00a0\u00b0C. Densification of the reaction mixture occurred via a liquid phase sintering at temperatures above 750\u00a0\u00b0C and diffusion of calcium, potassium, silicon and rubidium resulted in the formation of the new phases. The decomposition of zinnwaldite and the formation of the new phases increased extraction of lithium and rubidium. The formation of glassy phase probably hindered extraction of lithium but did not affect that of rubidium because of its outward diffusion to sinter's surface. The optimal extraction efficiencies of 84% of lithium and 91% of rubidium were achieved at sintering temperature of 825\u00a0\u00b0C and leaching temperature of 95\u00a0\u00b0C. The good fit of the hyperbolic and uniform reaction models to the leaching data indicated that dissolution of lithium and rubidium proceeded through two stages. Application of the shrinking core model showed that dissolution of lithium was controlled by diffusion. The formation of a layer of Ca(OH)2 on surface of sinters apparently slowed and then terminated dissolution of lithium and rubidium in the later stage of leaching.",

Two important strategies have been implementation of water reuse and sourcing of alternative water supplies that otherwise would have been disposed of, such as treated effluent.

A number of studies have shown the effect of inorganic water constituents on the performance of flotation. However, far less is known about the impacts and processes associated with organic constituents, particularly bacteria. This study investigated the quantitative relationship between bacterial concentration in flotation water using E. coli as the model bacterium and the flotation performance of chalcopyrite. Flotation tests were carried out to quantify the effect of E. coli cells on the flotation of three chalcopyrite-containing systems of increasing complexity: high-purity chalcopyrite, a simulated ore with controlled gangue, and a porphyry copper-gold ore. The experimental results show that E. coli cells negatively affected the flotation efficiency of chalcopyrite in all three systems. The bacterial cells also negatively affected the flotation efficiency of pyrite in the simulated ore system, and gold in the porphyry ore system. The bacterial cells preferentially attached to pyrite over chalcopyrite in the simulated ore system. Findings in this study contribute to identifying some of the potential risks posed by using bacteria-containing water for flotation, when attempting to improve water efficiency.",

Water-borne bacteria have been shown to negatively affect the efficiency of froth flotation when using a representative system consisting of E. coli as the model bacterium and chalcopyrite as the model mineral. It is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms that could explain the observed effect, to provide guidance on the subsequent solutions to deal with it. This study conducted a systematic investigation into the mechanism by which bacteria affect flotation efficiency using fluorescence microscopy, bubble attachment time measurements, and froth phase characteristics. E. coli bacterial cells in solution were found to attach to chalcopyrite surfaces. In turn, the surface hydrophobicity of chalcopyrite particles decreased as the number of the attached bacterial cells increased. Reduction in surface hydrophobicity resulted in less mineral particles attaching to bubbles, leading to decreased froth stability, bubble coalescence rate and froth velocity. Slurry pH and Eh were also affected by the presence of the bacterial cells. These changes were correlated with reductions in flotation recoveries. These experimental results contribute to an understanding of how biotic water constituents impact the operation of flotation plants that choose to use alternative water sources, and provide knowledge towards possible solutions to the negative effect of water-borne bacteria.",

The overall decomposition process consisted of the series of parallel and competitive reactions, which originated from the decomposition of various chemical species and solid-state transformations. This behavior was confirmed by the appearance of different forms of density distribution functions of apparent activation energy values.

Generally, the determination of the Bond work index of inhomogeneous materials can be carried out with high deviation using the conventional grindability apparatuses and methods, because of the highly different grindability of components. In the industry the feed of the grinding apparatuses frequently has components with high grindability-difference. The design and operation of the mills can be highly affected by the above mentioned properties. A possible solution can be the combined application of the Bond-method with the determination of the component's weight ratio in the product. The Bond measurement should be performed until the steady state conditions of grindability (G) and chemical composition of the components are reached. To prove the applicability of the above mentioned idea systematic Bond, Hardgrove grindability tests and Karra simulations were carried out of binary mixtures. The experimental results showed that the application of the combined procedure is proven in order to have a more accurate and reliable calculation of the Bond work index of composite materials, especially when the components have significant difference in the grindability and composition. The measurements also showed the possibilities and limits of the grindability tests and calculation methods.",

This study is a part of our activities towards complete utilization of slag for building material applications using geopolymerization process, which involves formation of a new rock like species from various aluminosilicate minerals under strong alkaline environment. This slag has been subjected to short grinding in a high-energy AGO-2 mill to enhance its reactivity. The paper particularly focuses on the influence of the grinding atmosphere, viz. air or CO2 on the geopolymers prepared from milled slag. Studies have shown that the particulate characteristics mostly remain unaffected by the milling atmosphere. However, conduction calorimetric experiments have shown that the milling atmosphere has a bearing on the reactivity of slag despite their similarity in particulate characteristics; CO2-milled slag has been found to be more reactive than the air-milled slag. Both air and CO2-milled slag has been found good geopolymerization behavior leading to high compressive strength of the geopolymer products; higher compressive strength values for the geopolymer prepared from the latter further shows its enhanced reactivity over the former. TCLP tests of the prepared samples confirm that the release of toxic metals is within USEPA limits and hence the process is an environment friendly way of utilizing the zinc slag.",

The mathematical model adopted is a combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for the liquid flow and discrete element method (DEM) for particle motion. The motion of individual particles is 3 dimensional (3D) and the flow of continuous liquid is 2 dimensional (2D), considering the bed thickness is only 1/3rd of the bed width, and one CFD computational cell is used through the thickness. Periodic boundary conditions are applied on the front and rear walls to emulate a bed of larger thickness using a relatively small number of particles. Stratification is heavily dependent on fluid motion through the jig. The study explores 5 different pulsation profiles. The profiles used are \u2014 sinusoidal, triangle, sawtooth-backward, sawtooth-forward, and trapezoidal. The initial packing conditions consist of a binary-density particle system where the light particles and heavy particles, have respective densities of 2540 and 4630\u00a0kg/m3. There are 1130 particles each 1\u00a0cm in diameter. As an initial comparison, all simulations are conducted using a fixed peak\u2013peak amplitude and pulsation period. Their relative performances are compared in terms of solid flow patterns, separation kinetics, energy, and mean particle position. The underlying mechanisms are explained in terms of particle\u2013fluid interaction force.

Four microbial strains with greater than 75% recovery of pure hematite were separated using the technique. Classification and identification of the 4 strains by 16S rDNA sequences were conducted. Among them only 1 strain, termed F3, can act as a collector for hematite, as it is not pathogenic to humans. The morphology and hematite adsorption (by scanning electron microscopy; SEM), composition, zeta potential and hydrophobicity of strain F3 were further evaluated. Based on the changes in the zeta potential and hydrophobicity of a hematite surface before and after adsorption with F3, its adsorption mechanism was also analysed. The results revealed that the combination technique of flotation and bacterial culturing is a highly effective technique for isolating bio-collectors from iron mine soil. Two flotation stages were required to isolate strain F3, which belongs to the genus Stenotrophomonas. This rod-shaped bacterium had CH2, CH3 and phosphate groups on its cell wall that imparted strong hydrophobicity and negative charge. Adsorption of strain F3 reduced the zeta potential of a hematite surface and enhanced its hydrophobicity. The adsorption of F3 to hematite is presumed to be through chemical adsorption.

     "abstract": "Iron ore pellets should have sufficient mechanical strengths against degradation at all stages of pellet production in pelletizing plants. Besides the strength, pellets should have less dust emission during operation since the process efficiency and the pelletizing equipments are adversely affected by dust. Dust is also a problem for sintered (product) pellets since they abrade during transportation from pellet production site to the reduction facilities. Sufficient mechanical strength and low dust emission of pellets are necessary for better operation and handling of pellets. In this study, dust emission mechanism of sintered magnetite pellets produced with different binders was comparatively studied. The results showed that the dust is not produced by pellet breakdown for sintered pellets with sufficient strength. It was found that dust generation of sintered pellets is not directly dependent on the mechanical strength. One of the dust generation mechanisms of sintered pellets with sufficient strength is the roughness of pellet surfaces. The attrition and impact forces during transportation cause dust generation from pellet surfaces. The surface smoothness is more important since the pellets with high strength and rough surfaces produced more dust than those with smooth surfaces and low strength. Half of the fines generated due to pellet attrition or impact forces during handling of sintered pellets will become airborne and are considered as loss and operational/environmental problem. The percentage of particulate matter (PM10) which is significant in health risk lied between 30% and 40% by weight of airborne pellet dust.",

     "abstract": "Long distance ore pipelines are intensive in water and energy use. Although past efforts have been made to identify the best operational points in terms of energy efficiency, an approach to concurrently include water value, representing aspects such as price or scarcity, is lacking. In the present paper, an optimization scheme to look for better operational points considering energy and water utilization is proposed. A scalar function built upon the computation of energy and water consumption including restrictions inherent to hydraulic transport of solids through pipelines is defined. The relative importance of energy and water consumption is parameterized through the inclusion of water and energy unit costs, along with system variables such as throughput, solids concentration and system utilization fraction. The optimization problem is solved for different throughput and hydraulic conditions resembling a long distance copper concentrate pipeline and a range of water and energy costs, using a nonlinear, constrained optimization scheme. Results show the appearance of a low water cost regime for low throughput conditions, with a steep, quasi-linear change on optimal properties with water cost, followed by a nonlinear, high water cost regime, related to a weaker, monotonic change of concentration, flow rate, pipeline utilization and water consumption, respectively. For fixed water costs, increasing the energy cost causes an incentive for an additional use of water, thus appearing a double non-linear dependence of optimal results with energy and water costs.For high enough throughputs, the low water cost regime disappears, and is replaced by constant, minimal optimal flow rate and solids concentrations, related to the maximum possible pipeline utilization constraint. Present results show that an equivalent pipeline oversizing at constant throughput would allow, in addition to the computed optimal conditions, for operation at lower specific energy consumption scenarios. Results, compared with some typical copper concentrate pipeline operational conditions, show that optimal values in the sense of the present hydraulic-cost analysis tend to require higher concentrations and lower pipeline utilization fractions than in typical systems, with differences in costs ranging from 16% to 28%.",

The strongest hydrophobic force was observed at contact angle above 90\u00b0 and in pure water, with a decay length of 29.5\u00a0nm. Both the contact angle and hydrophobic force increased with increasing xanthate concentration. At an excessively high concentration, the hydrophobic force diminished substantially. When the xanthate solution was replaced with pure water, however, a strong hydrophobic force reappeared, suggesting that the presence of residual xanthate ions in solution is detrimental to obtaining a strong and long-range hydrophobic force.

Roast-leach technology (sometimes called thermo-chemical processing) is potentially one of the options for removal of silica from bauxite using a thermal pre-treatment and leach step. However, the thermal pre-treatment transforms aluminium oxides in both kaolinite and valuable phases (gibbsite and boehmite) to transition aluminas which are difficult to extract using normal Bayer digestion. To better understand and solve this problem, we simplified the roast-leach process by roasting pure gibbsite and digesting the resultant transition aluminas. We investigated the relationship between roast temperature, dehydration extent, transition aluminas and Bayer extraction behaviour. We found that transition aluminas with thermodynamically relatively stable structures and better crystallinity were the cause of extraction difficulty. Extraction can be enhanced using higher caustic concentration and digestion temperature although these measures are not preferred in reality. The practical and effective method is perhaps the counter current double digestion which can extract all transition aluminas and produce pregnant liquor with desired aluminate concentration.",

The mixtures were prepared in two different approaches. In the first approach, the high purity galena and sphalerite were blended directly whereas in the second approach, the sphalerite was coated with copper before blending with galena. Using the first approach, it was found that lead ions contaminated the sphalerite surface making the separation non-selective. After adding EDTA, sphalerite was depressed by chitosan while galena was floated at pH 4. Using the second approach, i.e., that the sphalerite was pre-coated with copper before mixing with galena, it was found that the sphalerite was selectively depressed by chitosan without the need to add EDTA. ToF-SIMS and XPS were used to study the interactions of chitosan with uncoated sphalerite and copper-coated sphalerite. The results indicated that the amine groups and the hydroxyl groups in chitosan were involved in the strong interaction between chitosan and sphalerite whether the latter was coated by copper or not. Chitosan did not interact strongly with galena as reported previously.",

     "abstract": "The flotation chemistry of soluble salts has been studied for many decades. In this work, the flotation behavior of arcanite (K2SO4) and epsomite (MgSO4\u00b77H2O) with both the cationic collector, dodecylamine hydrochloride (DAH), and the anionic collector, sodium dodecyl-sufate (SDS), has been studied. The results show that K2SO4 can be floated with both the cationic and anionic collectors at natural pH. In contrast, MgSO4\u00b77H2O cannot be floated by either collector. The results indicate that the flotation response of these salts cannot be explained based on surface charge considerations. It is now known that interfacial water structure has been found to be a significant factor in the explanation of soluble salt flotation.In this regard, the water structure of K2SO4 and MgSO4 solutions was investigated by FTIR-transmission and FTIR-ATR methods which are useful to detect changes in water structure as influenced by dissolved salts. FTIR transmission spectra suggest that MgSO4 is a water structure making salt, while it is expected that K2SO4 is a structure breaker, although such an expectation is not confirmed from FTIR transmission spectra due to the low solubility of K2SO4.In this regard, FTIR-ATR measurements can also be used to determine the influence of dissolved salts on water structure. After subtraction of the O\u2013H band spectrum of salt solutions from that of pure water, the change in the \u201cice-like\u201d water structure as influenced by the dissolved salt (K2SO4 and MgSO4) can be observed even in solutions of K2SO4 at low concentrations. In summary, the results from FTIR spectroscopy of solutions show that K2SO4 is a water structure breaker, while MgSO4 is a water structure maker. This conclusion is further confirmed from a macroscopic view point by viscosity measurements. Again for these sulfate salts flotation is achieved with DAH and SDS as collectors if the salt is a water structure breaker.",

J. Miner. Process, 2012, submitted), including static input parameters of hydraulic interest, such as the specific gravity of solids, slurry particle size distribution and loose packing concentration. It is common that such variables fluctuate throughout the concentrate line operation, and thus the optimal estimated values in the light of the aforementioned optimization model. In the present paper, a continuation of the latter analysis including the effect of input parameter variability by means of a Monte Carlo analysis is proposed. Results show that, under a variety of unit water and energy cost scenarios, lack of process follow-up in front of relatively small variations of input parameters might cause important effects in optimal water and energy consumption, ultimately resulting in increased operational costs. By taking a copper concentrate long distance pipeline example case detailed in Ihle (2013b), present simulations reveal fluctuations on water and energy use close to 8% and 17%, respectively, whereas total costs may have variations up to 18%.",

As a result of the fine dissemination of the iron minerals and the most abundant gangue mineral, quartz, the optimum degree of grind is around 150\u00a0\u03bcm.

     "abstract": "In China, more than 87% of vanadium is discovered from stone coal. However, because the vanadium grade in stone coal is generally low, current vanadium extraction technology faces challenges in terms of large ore tonnage and high energy consumption, acid consumption and cost.A new process for pre-concentration of vanadium from stone coal by gravity separation was investigated based on mineralogical study. It was confirmed that the vanadium occurred in muscovite and illite, and the acid consuming minerals were pyrite and calcite. The process comprised three key steps: decarburization, selective grinding and gravity separation. In the decarburization stage, the thermal energy of carbon in the stone coal can be used and the V2O5 grade increased to some extent. The differences of V2O5 grade among different size fractions increased through the selective grinding stage. In the gravity separation stage, 28.9% of the feed ore were rejected as final tailings, while the V2O5 loss was 9.7%. The pre-concentration of vanadium from stone coal can improve the V2O5 grade and decrease the content of high acid consuming minerals. The benefits of the pre-concentration process in terms of cost savings and solving processing problems were discussed.",

     "abstract": "Gas dispersion properties are key parameters in flotation performance. Flotation rate constant has been reported to be strongly influenced by the bubble surface area flux (Sb). In order to determine Sb, both superficial gas velocity (Jg) and the bubble size distribution (BSD) have to be measured. The superficial gas velocity can be easily measured using the inverted probe method. On the other hand, measuring the bubble size distribution is an intricate process. Among the available methods for measuring BSD, image analysis is the most popular; nevertheless, it has some limitations, especially when bubbles appear touching each other in the image (bubble clusters). From a classical image analysis point of view, it is usually assumed that bubble clusters occur as a non-selective process and that not considering them does not bias the measurement.In this work, an alternative method for measuring BSD is presented. The image is represented as a coverage stochastic process, namely a Boolean model with circular objects, which allows determining statistical diameters, d10 and d32, and the complete BSD directly from the binary image. Both the classical image analysis and the Boolean modelling were tested first with a series of images generated at a laboratory flotation cell, and later with a series of simulated images where the actual BSD was known. In both cases, the stochastic approach proved to be better than classical image analysis in the determination of BSD and statistical diameters. The results show that even if bubble clusters are non-selective (which was imposed on the simulated images) large bubbles are more likely to be in a cluster, which implies that clusters must be considered in the measurement to avoid biased estimations.",

This is the first report of dry separation of lump copper ores using a dry sand fluidised bed dense medium. The separation point density and the separation efficiency, characterised by the probable error, can be controlled by changing the amount of different density sand particles in the medium mixture and the fluidisation air velocity. It has been shown that separation point densities between about 2200 and 3700\u00a0kg/m3 with probable errors typically in the range of 0.01 to 0.06 can be obtained. Ores with particles in the size range of between about 10 and 25\u00a0mm can be treated. Depending on the ore mass\u2013density distribution and copper-density distribution, between about 20 to more than 40% of the low density ore could potentially be rejected prior to wet grinding with little loss of valuable copper. This would significantly reduce the amount of energy and water required for wet grinding and down stream processing such as flotation.",

     "abstract": "The attachment of bubbles onto a collecting surface plays a critical role in flotation which is utilised for the separation of mineral ores, coal or plastic materials. While mineral flotation deals with fine particles and larger bubbles, this work is focused on the opposite case of an interaction of a single rising bubble (Db\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0mm) with a larger spherical particle, which falls down through a stagnant liquid. The collision is studied theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical model, based on an analysis of forces acting on the bubble, leads to a differential equation for the bubble motion. Both the mobile and immobile bubble surfaces are considered. The experimental bubble trajectory and velocity evolution are in good agreement with the theoretical model. The horizontal deflection of the bubble trajectory caused by the particle motion is dependent on the ratio of bubble terminal velocity and particle settling velocity. The influence of buoyancy, interception and inertial mechanisms on the collision efficiency is also examined. It is concluded that the buoyancy is the most significant mechanism for the interaction of small bubbles with large particles.",

Second, the separation and recovery of some rare earth elements (La(III) and Nd(III)) from acidic solutions using the synthetic adsorbent were investigated.

The most significant development presented here is the extension of the analytical law to concentrated suspensions, which makes it applicable to actual plant operating conditions. Two examples of industrial use cases are described and studied by interrogation of the model: dredged sediment waste reduction and coal recovery from fine tailings. Comparisons with empirical studies available in the literature show a good agreement between model predictions and industrial data. The model is then used to identify separation efficiency limitations as well as possible solutions to overcome them. These two examples serve to show how this predictive model can be used to obtain valuable information to improve physical separation processes using a Falcon concentrator, or to evaluate Falcon separator's abilities for new applications.",

The adsorption of the collector on Fe oxides was found to be quite different from that on Cu oxides, in that only hydroxamate chemisorbed to Fe atoms and some co-adsorbed hydroxamic acid were detected at conditioned Fe oxide surfaces whereas multilayer Cu hydroximate is adsorbed on conditioned Cu oxides. The absence of multilayer Fe hydroxamate on the Fe oxides was corroborated by means of Raman spectroscopy. Notwithstanding relatively low collector coverage after the minerals were conditioned for periods of relevance to flotation, and the absence of multilayer Fe hydroxamate, abraded surfaces of hematite, magnetite and pyrrhotite appeared, by visual inspection, to be clearly hydrophobic. For fracture and abraded surfaces of the relatively pure pyrite investigated, only after extended air exposure prior to conditioning in collector solution was there evidence for the formation of minor multilayer Fe hydroxamate from interaction of hydroxamate with Fe sulfate. It was concluded that the principal species chemisorbed on the Fe oxides was bidentate hydroxamate, but that at higher coverage, monodentate hydroxamate was also chemisorbed. It is postulated that the monodentate species was also formed in vacuo as an alteration product by the secondary electrons inherent in the photoemission process and by the low energy electrons from a flood-gun when it was used.",

The adsorption behavior of the chelating resins towards Ag(I) from aqueous media was studied. Better adsorption behavior was achieved for Ag(I) by R-en resin. The chelating matrix obtained from ethylenediamine showed uptake capacity of 1.13\u00a0mmol/g in 20\u00a0min and at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. These resins were evaluated for their recovery of Ag(I) from aqueous solutions using batch methods and column techniques. Various parameters such as pH, agitation time, Ag(I) concentration and temperature had been studied. The kinetics and thermodynamic behavior of the adsorption reaction were defined. The obtained resins achieved promising results in the selective separation of Ag(I) from other metal ions. Both kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process were obtained. The data indicated that the adsorption process is an exothermic reaction and kinetically proceeds according to pseudo-second order model. Regeneration and durability of the loaded resin towards the successive cycles were clarified. These parameters indicated that the resins can be applied in the removal of Ag(I).",

     "abstract": "Homogenization piles are largely used in the mining industry for variability reduction in the head grades of the ore feeding the processing plants. Various methods are used when designing homogenization piles, and most fail to incorporate the in situ grade variability that is intrinsic to the mineral deposit. The methodology proposed here combines longitudinal piles and geostatistical simulations to emulate the in situ variability as well as the reclaimed pile grade variability. A blending/homogenization simulator for longitudinal stockpiles has been developed, where the input to the algorithm consists of the pre-defined mining sequence, and has been applied to several simulated scenarios of the mineral deposit. This sequence is re-arranged by the algorithm, which selects the blocks that will form the pile of each simulated block model, and simulates the operation of the stacking and reclaiming equipment. The output sequence of the algorithm reflects the quality fluctuation of the grade after the blending/homogenization and reclamation. Using this methodology one can evaluate, within a certain time period, the expected grade variability for various pile sizes as well as the internal grade variability when a given pile is reclaimed. Results from a case study at two large iron mines operated by Vale S.A. proved the usefulness and functionality of the method. It is demonstrated that the rate of variability decreases as the pile size increases. It is also demonstrated that the internal grade variability decreases for a given pile size, when the number of layers in the pile is increased.",

     "abstract": "Frothers are used in flotation to reduce bubble size and as a consequence increase gas holdup. For 1-alcohols, C 4 to C 7, and three commercial frothers, MIBC, DF250 and F150, it is shown that at equivalent Sauter mean bubble size gas holdup depends on frother type. The paper explains the gas holdup result by showing the effect of frother type on single bubble rise velocity profile, i.e., local velocity vs. distance (up to 350\u00a0cm). For example, a 1.45\u00a0mm bubble in 0.4\u00a0mmol/L pentanol hardly slows relative to water only while in 0.4\u00a0mmol/L hexanol it reaches minimum velocity. This corresponds to the higher gas holdup in 1-hexanol compared to 1-pentanol. To compare frothers we introduce velocity at 300\u00a0cm vs. concentration and the concentration to reach minimum velocity, CMV. The CMV illustrates the strong frother effect: for example, CMV for the alcohols decreases by about one order of magnitude for every 1 C increase in chain length. The decrease in CMV with frother type correlates with the increase in gas holdup. It is shown that all frothers tested follow the same minimum velocity-size trend modeled reasonably by the relationship proposed by Karamanev for terminal velocity.",

Suspensions with fast-settling coarse fractions make traditional rheological measurements tedious and inaccurate. These measurements are critical to the design and operation of mixing, dewatering, pumping and tailings equipment and operations.A methodology for predicting the gel point, close packing fraction and shear rheology of particulate slurries containing a binary mixture of fine and coarse material is presented. The model has validity subject to the constraint that the particle size of the coarse material is sufficiently distinct from that of the fine material. The model enables calculation of the gel point and close packing fraction of the mixture based on the gel points and close packing fractions of the pure fine and coarse materials in the suspension. The model predicts that the gel point (and close packing fraction) of the fine material increases with increasing coarse fraction until a maximum value is attained before decreasing to the gel point (or close packing fraction) of the coarse material.This relationship provides a subsequent basis for a yield stress model to accurately predict the yielding behaviour of binary mixtures of fine and coarse material. The model is useful in determining whether a sample exhibits yield stress behaviour through knowledge of the gel point and close packing fraction of the constitutive fine and coarse components. The model is exemplified using particulate mixtures containing coagulated aluminium oxide, calcium carbonate and coarse sand.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of using bacterial leaching to solubilize copper from a porphyry sulphide ore, a part of the Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex. The bulk ore sample contained 18% pyrite and 0.8% Cu mostly as secondary chalcocite and Cu oxides. Mineral microscopy showed that pyrite grains in this porphyry ore were coated by chalcocite. Conventional flotation could not be used for ore beneficiation because Cu-sulphide could not be selectively separated from pyrite and consequently the flotation concentrate contained too much Fe and less Cu. Hence bioleaching was tested as an alternative process for this ore. The bioleaching was tested with a consortium of mesophilic acidophiles comprising Leptospirillum and Acidithiobacillus spp., originally enriched from the Sarcheshmeh site. Several mineral salt formulations were tested in shake flask bioleaching experiments. These experiments resulted in 89\u201392% Cu yields with no discernible differences between the different formulations. Sterile controls representing chemical acid leaching resulted in about 60% Cu solubilization. For column bioleaching experiments, ore samples (~\u00a040\u00a0kg each; 75% \u2212\u00a012\u00a0mm) were agglomerated and treated with a schedule of 4\u00a0days of irrigation and 4\u00a0days of rest period.

     "abstract": "Cyanide has been the universal reagent for gold leaching on counts of higher stability, lower cost and better understood chemistry. However, its high toxicity and slow leaching kinetics have called for research into alternative leaching reagents, of which thiosulfate and thiourea appear to be promising. Unlike the cyanide system, interaction of thiourea and thiosulfate systems with carbonaceous matter (CM) has not received much research attention. As non-cyanide reagents become important alternatives for gold leaching, it is imperative to assess the degree of gold adsorption (preg-robbing) in these systems and find ways of reducing this effect.This paper presents the results of a study on reduction in gold uptake by CM in cyanide and non-cyanide systems due to fungal-treatment. Comparison is made between cyanide and non-cyanide systems on the bases of changes in gold adsorption by surrogate CM and CM in refractory gold ores. The results indicate that gold adsorption by as-received surrogates is in the order of cyanide\u00a0>\u00a0thiourea\u00a0>\u00a0thiosulfate, whereas after fungal-transformation, reduction in gold adsorption is more pronounced in cyanide than in thiourea and thiosulfate solutions. The decrease in gold adsorption on the CM is about 70\u201397% in cyanide, 60\u201392% in thiourea and 50\u201391% in thiosulfate. In general, the results exhibit a potential technique for reducing preg-robbing in the processing of carbonaceous gold ores with cyanide, thiourea and thiosulfate solutions.",

The present study was undertaken to investigate the solubility properties of individual calcite and smithsonite minerals and their mixtures, and establish correlation between solution chemistry and flotation behavior. Solution chemical calculations show that the species distribution of smithsonite and calcite was strongly affected by solution pH value. With the increase of pH, the measured solubility of calcite is very close to the theoretical value, while that of smithsonite is less than the theoretical value, illustrating that surface precipitations of zinc hydroxide and hydrozincite are possible. In the mixed system, solution chemical calculations show that the conversion from smithsonite and calcite to hydrozincite and zinc hydroxide is spontaneous. The flotation behavior of smithsonite and calcite was studied with the supernatants, and XPS analysis was conducted to detect surface properties. Both simulation results and experimental data show that surface conversion from calcite to zinc species has a vital influence on the separation of smithsonite from calcite by flotation.",

Also, it can potentially reduce the need for on-going management of disposal impoundments post-closure, as well as open opportunities for re-use of the residue material. In this study bauxite residue neutralisation has been examined using a range of neutralising agents measuring the change in pH, in addition to the quality of leachate produced, specifically alkalinity and solution aluminium concentration. Solution alkalinity is removed by neutralisation and precipitation for mineral acid addition and through precipitation by soluble calcium or magnesium salt addition. Carbonation removes alkalinity through neutralisation and transformation to bicarbonate. An equilibrium pH of less than 10 is achieved only if the solid phase alkalinity is suppressed (Ca/Mg) or dissolved (acid). The kinetics of this process is inhibited by mass transfer limitations (acid processes) and a sustainable presence of a soluble excess (Ca/Mg processes). The solution alkalinity after neutralisation to pH\u00a010 is reduced to less than 1% of the initial value using mineral acid or a soluble calcium or magnesium source. Using carbon dioxide the solution alkalinity is only reduced by about 40%. Comparing acid to Ca/Mg treated bauxite residue there is a difference in the mechanism in which the soluble aluminium is precipitated from the solution alkalinity, such that at equivalent pH values, the aluminium solution concentration is higher for acid treated bauxite residue compared to Ca/Mg treated bauxite residue. Aspects of implementing bauxite residue neutralisation within the context of a dry stacking operation are discussed.",

This work aims at exploring the effect of particle size on pyrite surface chemistry through the study of three pyrite size fractions up to 425\u00a0\u03bcm. Pyrite surface evolution was investigated through dry crushing, air oxidation and aqueous conditioning using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) as complementary surface characterization tools. XPS, which characterized the outmost surface (about 40\u00a0\u00c5 depth), indicated that pyrite size fraction did not impact its surface chemistry after crushing. However, DRIFT which characterizes the whole oxidation layer, led to the conclusion that ferric sulfate was more abundant in the finer fraction than in the two coarser fractions. Those two surface characterization tools allowed a thorough insight into the three-dimensional oxidation product structures of pyrite from different size fractions. The surface evolution of coarse fractions had the same surface evolution trend when submitted to aging and conditioning processes than the fine pyrite size fraction, studied in previous works, in terms of surface species speciation and their relative proportion. Those results led to a better understanding of particle size impacts on pyrite surface chemistry.",

     "abstract": "During dry beneficiation of coal using a gas\u2013solid fluidized bed a secondary gas-distribution layer forms at the bottom of the bed. The effect of the particle size and depth of this secondary layer on the fluidization characteristics of the bed was investigated in this work. The experimental results show that the variance in both the bed pressure-drop and the bed density decreased with a decrease in the mean particle size of the secondary layer. This reduced variance indicates an improvement in the fluidization quality. Increasing the depth of the secondary layer causes both of these variances to decrease through a minimum and to then increase. The optimum depth of the secondary layer was determined to be 30\u00a0mm. The reason for these experimental results is discussed based on the effect the secondary layer has on the gas distribution region of a bubbling bed. It is pointed out that the secondary layer can divide large bubbles passing through the region into small bubbles and can increase the pressure drop of the gas distributor compared to a normal bubbling bed. Furthermore, the actual gas velocity is decreased by the secondary layer, which leads to a moderated shock from the gas to the bed. The secondary layer is, therefore, beneficial for increasing the bed stability.

Bulk (electron microprobe) and surface (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) composition measurements have indicated that the Rhode Island and Delaware talcs have the lowest level of Al atoms substituted within the talc structure (0.008%), and detectable at the cleaved basal plane surface (1.5 and 1.7%), and that the Flinders Range talc has the highest level of Al atoms (8.5% bulk; 8.2% surface). Contact angle measurements have highlighted the role of Al atom substitution and step-edge density (as revealed by AFM imaging) on the measured hydrophobicity of the cleaved surfaces, with the Flinders Range talc and the Rhode Island talc having significantly lower contact angles than the Delaware talc (65\u00b0 and 83\u00b0, respectively, versus 90\u00b0 for the Delaware). In addition, we have characterised the adsorption of two polysaccharide polymers on the three talc samples (CMC and Dextrin TY) using in situ tapping mode AFM. CMC adsorbs with the same morphology on all three talc samples, whereas Dextrin TY presents three different morphologies on the talc surfaces. The potential implications of the observed variation in adsorption behaviour on mineral flotation are discussed.",

More than 4\u00a0million tons of red mud is generated annually in India only. Presently, it is stored or dumped on land, or in the oceans near alumina refineries. However, its high alkalinity is a potential pollution to threat water, land and air. While high costs are associated with the large area of land required for storage of the residue. India is amongst the major producers of alumina in the world. There are some differences in mineralogical composition between the residues from India and other countries due to the difference in the ore type in its production processes. Significant achievements in treatment and utilization of red mud have been obtained in India in the last decade. In this paper, the various proposals for the utilization of red mud generated in India are presented. Similarly, the drawbacks associated with these potential commercial applications of red mud are discussed.",

Additionally, turbidity is often used to measure induction times of nucleation thus the method can monitor dissolution and nucleation simultaneously. It must be remembered, however, that turbidity will show different behaviour to ICP when phenomena such as settling and aggregation occur thus these processes must be considered when interpreting data. Finally, the size limit of the turbidimetric technique must be determined as this, too, can influence the interpretation of data.",

The addition of quartz particles can limit the detrimental effect of serpentine on the flotation of pentlandite.

     "abstract": "The findings of synchrotron based spectromicroscopic investigations of Cu and xanthate adsorption onto pyrite surfaces are reported. Synchrotron based photoemission electron microscopy measurements have revealed that Cu adsorbs only onto specific surface sites on pyrite. The Cu 2p X-ray absorption near edge structure and position (2p3/2 peak at 934.3\u00a0eV) confirms the presence of Cu+ with transitions from 2p to 4s states being apparent. Moreover, the peak position is typical of Cu+ bonded to S, Cu(I)S. This is confirmed by S 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with oxidised S2\u00a0\u2212 species (S\u2212), most likely resulting from electrochemical interaction of solution Cu2\u00a0+ and surface S2\u00a0\u2212 species, being observed. Fe 2p X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that surface Fe does not take part in the Cu adsorption or subsequent restructuring processes.Synchrotron FTIR microscopy analysis of xanthate (potassium ethyl xanthate, KEX) adsorbed onto Cu activated surfaces also shows a heterogeneous distribution on pyrite. The use of a dilute (10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0M) KEX concentration shows Cu(I)\u2013xanthate as the only surface xanthate containing species. This species may have formed through a chemical process involving previously adsorbed Cu+ and the xanthate from solution. When a greater (10\u2212\u00a03\u00a0M) concentration of KEX is used significant concentrations of Cu(I)\u2013xanthate precipitate from solution onto the pyrite surfaces and cannot be easily removed. Under this condition, the predominant surface species remains Cu(I)\u2013xanthate with smaller concentrations of diethyl dixanthogen also being present.

     "abstract": "The conformation of acrylamide/acrylate copolymers' aqueous solutions is known to be affected by the presence of cations to varying degrees. Such effects are expected to be reflected in the flocculation activity of the polymer solutions, but the published literature in this area is far from convincing, particularly on the influence of divalent cations. Part of the problem was believed to stem from the inevitable poor control of the applied shear conditions (both intensity and duration) in conventional batch cylinder or jar tests. To address this, continuous flocculation was achieved in a Couette mixing device that allowed operator-independent settling rate measurements to be made, with much greater control over the residence time under shear and its intensity. A standard calcite (calcium carbonate) slurry was then used as the substrate for comparison between flocculants of increasing anionic character in the presence of selected cations at various concentrations. Rather than shifting the dosage response curve, the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ were found to limit the settling rates that could be achieved at higher dosages, but this effect could be masked under stronger applied shear conditions that favour some degree of aggregate breakage and also limit settling rates. Such effects increased with the flocculant's anionic character and the cation concentration. In contrast to the conventional anionic products, a flocculant that contained an alternative functional chemistry (BASF Rheomax\u00ae 1050) was found to be far less affected by the presence of these cations. Low levels of iron (either as Fe2+ or Fe3+) were sufficient to deactivate dilute flocculant solutions, but had reduced effects when present in stock solutions. The mechanisms by which the different cations affect flocculant solutions are discussed, together with the practical implications for flocculant make-up and application within gravity thickening as practiced in mineral processing.",

The following key factors were selected for study: temperature, H2SO4 concentration in the leaching solution, acid solution/ash ratio and the particle size of the ash.

Some softer minerals, often gangue minerals with lower iron contents such as kaolinite or ochreous goethite, disintegrate several orders of magnitude faster than the valuable iron-bearing minerals such as magnetite or hematite. This facilitates selective disintegration of the gangue minerals leaving the valuable minerals mostly unchanged.A set of experiments involving ultrasonic treatment of four Australian iron ore fine samples was undertaken using three different ultrasonic experimental setups. The effect of ultrasound duration, power and pulp density on the recoveries and grades of iron, alumina and silica was studied.The results showed that for hematitic/goethitic ores, the application of ultrasound enabled soft material of relatively low iron grade to de-agglomerate from the larger size fractions and report to the ultrafine size fractions. Modelled de-sliming of the ultrasonically treated ores showed that de-sliming following ultrasonic treatment could significantly improve the product iron grade, while de-sliming with a finer cut size could also improve the iron recovery compared with de-sliming identical ore that had not been pre-treated with ultrasound. It has been shown mathematically that in some scenarios it may be possible to simultaneously increase the iron grade and iron recovery in the de-slimed product if the ore has been treated with ultrasound before de-sliming.",

To better understand the options available for mitigating this problem, a novel scale\u2013velocity model is proposed in this paper for slurry systems commonly found in mineral processing plants. The new qualitative scale growth model predicts that at very low fluid velocities the scale growth rate is enhanced by an increase in fluid velocity due to the mass transfer-controlled scale growth. At higher fluid velocities, the scale growth rate decreases with increasing fluid velocity due to the increased flow erosion effect, for slurry systems. This suggests the potential of particulate erosion as a scale suppression mechanism. The model predicts the existence of an optimal slurry flow velocity, where scaling rate and equipment erosion rate are both zero. The optimal fluid velocity value is proposed to be used as the main parameter to improve engineering design of mineral processes in terms of scale suppression.A novel agitator design, swirl flow technology (SFT), developed and patented by CSIRO and Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL) in Australia was introduced as an agitator design that better meets requirements for scale suppression than a widely used conventional draft-tube agitator system. SFT agitation has been installed in gibbsite precipitators at QAL's alumina plant for a decade.As shown by CFD simulations and laboratory measurements, swirled flow agitation generates more uniform velocity distribution and higher velocity values at the wall than conventional agitators for the same power input; this reduces the maximum growth rate of scaling in the tank leading to significantly prolonged precipitator's service life. Based on the full-scale operational experience at QAL, it can be suggested that SFT agitation roughly halves the scale growth rate as compared to that measured in the conventional draft tube agitator systems.",

     "abstract": "Solvent Extraction\u2013Electrowinning (SX\u2013EW) is a hydrometallurgical process involving the dissolution and reprecipitation of copper from solution. The organic phases which are widely used in the SX process are very important economically. On the other hand, there are many poisonous components such as phenol in its chemical construction, so its degradation can be critical at economical and environmental point of view. The organic solutions which are used in the Sarcheshmeh Copper Mine consist of LIX 984N as a main extractant and REYSOL 8411, 8401 and kerosene as diluents. The loss of the organic phase from solvent extraction circuits is a major cost factor for SX/EW operations. Recognized sources of loss include evaporation, entrainment, and biological degradation. The mechanisms for both entrainment and evaporative losses are well recognized. Biological degradation of the organic component has not been as extensively evaluated as the other mechanisms but may be a major source of loss. This paper discusses the impact of biological degradation on an operating plant, potential mechanisms for degradation, conditions under which biodegradation of plant organic can occur and plant conditions that may assist in promoting biodegradation. In this research, isolation and identification of microorganisms which are involved in the degradation of the organic phase of the SX unit in the Sarcheshmeh copper mine were investigated. Samples of soil and activated sludge and a sample from an extraction unit were inoculated into microbial culture media containing organic solution as the only carbon source. After growth and isolation of microorganisms, three genera of bacteria, Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas and Moraxella, and two genera of fungi, Aspergillus and Phialophora, were identified.",

     "abstract": "At present, large mechanical flotation cells of 100 to 300\u00a0m3 are used in rougher operation in different industrial flotation plants around the world. However, in spite of the advances in fundamental research and the notable growth in equipment size, there is still a lack of reliable data for industrial flotation modelling and simulation. In this work, a procedure for modelling and simulating rougher flotation banks that is based on operating variables and parameters fitted by empirical data from plant measurements is presented.Recently, a new methodology for describing industrial flotation by separating the collection and froth zones has been developed. This approach consists of using a new apparatus for direct bubble load measurement below the pulp\u2013froth interface in industrial cells. The procedure allows independently estimating the froth recovery and the collection zone recovery. Metallurgical characterisation is developed by plant sampling, mass balance adjustment and applying a short-cut method for kinetic characterisation of flotation banks. In addition, the effect of grinding is characterised using flotation models with distributed flotation rates (for each particle size class) and a low number of parameters.From the experimental data, a non-linear distributed model to simulate rougher flotation banks was developed, which allows describing the industrial operation as a function of the main operating variables (e.g., mass flow rate, solid percentage, grinding degree, pulp level and superficial air rate). The simulator was calibrated and validated using experimental data from the rougher operation at El Teniente Division, Codelco-Chile.The new approach is a practical tool that is useful for flotation operation diagnosis, for robust design and analysis of new control and optimisation strategies and for evaluation of the effect that design and operating variables have upon the collection and froth zone performance in large flotation cells. This methodology can be applied to other flotation operations, such as cleaner and scavenger circuits that use mechanical flotation cells.",

These PLK rocks even though contain >\u00a040% of Al2O3 are not suitable for metallurgical industries due to the presence of reactive silica. The rock is not directly suitable for value addition as it contains major discoloring element (iron oxide) as impurity which renders it unsuitable for use as a filler material. Physical methods such as magnetic separation, flotation, scrubbing etc. are not fully successful for removal of iron from PLK rocks. Acid leaching techniques are the only alternative method to minimize iron content in the PLK rocks. Present investigation is to get superfine particles from PLK rocks by stage crushing followed by classification using hydrocyclone. These superfine particles are subjected to hydrochloric acid leaching to remove the iron content and the final product is suitable for industries. First order reaction kinetics is found to be fit for the experimental results. The apparent activation energy for F1 model is 48.8\u00a0kJ/mol and for R3 model is 71.1\u00a0kJ/mol, which is much less compared to leaching of iron from bauxite. The brightness of the product is 80% which is desirable for filler industries. Ceramic properties of the product are compared with the Indian Standard and are found suitable for ceramic industries.",

Due to anisotropic behavior of flow inside the hydrocyclones, LES is a suitable method to predict the flow field since it resolves large scales and models isotropic small scales. Obtained velocity field using the LES approach in comparison with other turbulence models is in good agreement with available experimental velocity measurements. The method of Lagrangian particle tracking with an optimized search algorithm (closest cell) is also used to evaluate the separation efficiency of deoiling hydrocyclones.

Of concern in this study is the preparation of LDHs from secondary wastes and the relative performance of the resulting LDHs as an anion exchanger for the inorganic ions including Cr(VI), B, As(III) and Se(IV) and organic compounds including terephthalate and dodecyl sulfate ions.The aluminum dross was effectively leached with HCl and NaOH. However the use of HCl, which although effectively dissolved the dross (65%), showed little selectivity for Al leaching. Whereas NaOH showed lower metal dissolution (36%) but resulted in purer solution (96% Al). Various LDHs including Mg\u2013Al, Ca\u2013Al and Zn\u2013Al type were prepared by co-precipitation of metals from the aluminum dross leachates. No noticeable differences in the XRD pattern, thermogram and anion exchange capacity among the various LDHs were found. The presence of other metal impurities did not significantly affect the performance of LDHs prepared. The Mg\u2013Al LDH captured about 85% to almost 100% of anionic organic and inorganic species from the dilute solution, showing the best performance among the LDHs tested. This study has demonstrated the preparation and efficacy of Mg\u2013Al, Ca\u2013Al and Zn\u2013Al type LDHs prepared from aluminum dross and thus the potential of this technology for reusing this secondary waste.",

An artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed which predicts directly the terminal velocity of solid spheres falling through Newtonian and non-Newtonian power law liquids from the knowledge of the properties of the spherical particle (density and diameter) and of the surrounding liquid (density and rheological parameters). With a combination of non-Newtonian data with Newtonian data taken from published data giving a database of 88 sets, an artificial neural network is designed. Analysis of the predictions shows that the artificial neural network could be used with good engineering accuracy to directly predict the terminal velocity of solid spheres falling through Newtonian and non-Newtonian power law liquids covering an extended range of power law values from 1.0 down to 0.06.",

     "abstract": "The importance of solids and water flow to the froths is recognized by the published literature on entrainment of fine hydrophilic particles in flotation. The role of different variables on solids and water flow to the flotation froths are presented in the current paper based on the experiments carried out on conventional (batch) and column cells using coking coal fines. The batch flotation studies were carried out to evaluate the kinetic behavior of solids and water flows to the froths. The kinetic parameters (W\u221e and k) were effectively utilized to quantify the process and a \u2018rate index\u2019 has been introduced to measure the relative motion of solids to water. The studies show that the solids and water flows are influenced by the design and operating conditions of the flotation units. The quantity of water is higher than the solids quantity reporting to the froths in both conventional and column flotation operations. The mass ratio of solids to water is higher in conventional cell compared to the flotation column, which indicates that the shallow froth depths push more solids to the froths compared to the deep froths. The implications of solids and water flows to the froths need to be known further to use these entities in actual practice.",

The curing regime was different: one set of the specimens was cured at room temperature until reaching 7 and 28\u00a0days and the other sets were oven cured for 36\u00a0h at the range of 40\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C and then cured at room temperature until 7 and 28\u00a0days.

The data used as inputs in gene expression programming models are arranged in a format of six parameters that cover the percentage of fine fly ash in the ash mixture, the percentage of coarse fly ash in the ash mixture, the percentage of fine rice husk bark ash in the ash mixture, the percentage of coarse rice husk bark ash in the ash mixture, the temperature of curing and the time of water curing. According to these input parameters, in the gene expression programming models, the percentage of water absorption of each specimen was predicted.

Colemanite was tested as an alternative binder to bentonite either alone or in combination with some organic binders on magnetite pellets. The performances of the tested binders on pellet qualities: balling, wet pellet moisture content, drop number, compressive strengths and microstructure of pellets have been compared with the performances of reference bentonite binders. The results of the tests showed that the qualities of pellets are insufficient when organic binders and colemanite are used as binders alone. The former failed to provide sufficient preheated and fired pellet strengths, the latter failed in terms of wet and dry pellet quality. However, good quality wet, dry, preheated and fired pellets could be produced with the combination of these two binders. In addition, stronger pellets could be produced at lower firing temperatures like 1373\u00a0K thanks to addition of colemanite. The bonding mechanism of colemanite containing pellets was examined by scanning electron microscopy.

     "abstract": "The paper describes the specific features of flow processes. The literature assumes that the separation criterion in flow processes is the diversification of settling velocities of particles in the separation medium. Nonetheless, it is very common to identify the realization of many flow processes with particle classification (sizing), i.e. separation according to the particle size, or cleaning (sorting), that is separation according to the particle density. The reason behind this, is the lack of a method for characterizing the particle populations according to the characteristic which is assumed as the separation criterion, here, the settling velocity of particles. The basic methods for characterizing the particle population and their relationship with partition curves have been described. The attention was drawn to the necessity of finding agreement between the real separation criterion and the method in which the particle population is characterized for the purpose of analysis and modelling of the flow processes. The characterisation method for particle populations has been proposed. The method is a combination of two basic particle population characterisation methods i.e. size analysis and sink and float test. The principle of the method is the calculation of the settling velocity of narrow particle size and density fractions in the separation medium and, next, arranging the separated size and density fractions according to the settling velocity. The above methodology was applied in characterizing two various coal slurries. The slurries were next separated in two various realizations of flow processes. One type of slurry was separated in the classifying and thickening HC-100 type hydrocyclone and the other one in HWO-300 type water-only cyclone. Prognoses were prepared, concerning the theoretical results of ideal separation (excluding the randomness of industrial processes) of both slurries according to the hitherto applied methods and according to the method, based on the distribution of settling velocity of particles. The results of prognoses were compared with the results of real separations. The method for characterising the particle population provides more complete and more accurate prognoses of the results of separation in hydrocyclones. One of the method's advantages is the conformity of the particle population characterisation method with real separation criterion in flow processes. The paper is concluded by a discussion of faults and uncertainties of the method for characterizing particle populations.",

Modelling can be used to predict the hopper flow based on material properties and hopper design. We have simulated the flow in a cylindrical hopper and validated it by performing 3D experiments. Further the model is used to investigate the effect of material properties and hopper design. It was found that stagnant zone size increases with increase in internal friction angle and decrease in ability of granular material to transfer load. It is also observed that stagnant zone size decreases as hopper angle is increased. Optimum hopper angle can be calculated from the simulation to minimise hopper height. This model can further be used for predicting flow for more complex conditions.",

The experiments show that high nickel content nickeliferous concentrate containing 6.0% Ni with nickel recovery of 92.1% could be produced with over 75% of the reduced ore, containing low nickel concentration, rejected. The tests indicated that the selectivity of reduction depends mainly on reduction atmosphere and silica level.

However, in single mineral flotation and adsorption tests, it was found that both chalcopyrite and galena were depressed and chitosan adsorbed on both minerals. The observed selectivity seemed to have originated from competitive adsorption. ToF-SIMS measurements indicated that when chalcopyrite and galena were present together in the suspension, chitosan barely adsorbed on galena but adsorbed heavily on chalcopyrite. Chitosan-metal ions adsorption test, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as ToF-SIMS were employed to study the interaction of chitosan with chalcopyrite and galena and to delineate the observed competitive adsorption.

     "abstract": "It has been proposed that blending of the Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation (KUCC) Bingham Canyon poorly-floating limestone skarn (LSN) ore with the monzonite ore (MZ), which in isolation floats well, results in a \u2018poisoning\u2019 effect on chalcopyrite, bornite and molybdenite flotation recovery. This proposition has been examined via a combined study of mineralogy, liberation, solution, surface and SEM analyses of batch flotation samples.Cu grade versus recovery for the blended ore (70% MZ: 30% LSN) was close to that predicted by pro-rata flotation of the separate fractions and hence flotation poisoning of the MZ copper containing minerals is not occurring. In contrast recovery and grade of molybdenite, which is only present in significant quantities in the MZ ore, was significantly reduced as compared to pro-rata prediction, indicative of a poisoning effect on flotation performance.Although pre- and post-conditioning and tailings water samples were super-saturated with respect to a range of Mg and Ca-containing species similar supersaturation trends were observed regardless of the ore or blend used. Hence, precipitation of hydrophilic species onto mineral surfaces cannot be used to explain the differences in flotation phenomena observed.Similar surface contamination of chalcopyrite, bornite and molybdenite in both the LSN and blended ore concentrates was observed, whereas the surfaces of molybdenite in the MZ concentrates were relatively clean. The principal surface contamination of the concentrates for the blended ore, which increased in severity between the 1st and 4th concentrates, was from Ca and Fe hydroxides, phosphates and Ca and Mg aluminosilicate gangue. This is in agreement with the observed mineralogy with the LSN ore containing considerably greater proportions of the Mg-containing minerals pyroxene, amphibole and talc, and the Ca-containing minerals, calcite and andradite than the MZ ore.It is suggested that the transfer of hydrophilic components from the LSN to MZ ores on blending has little effect on Cu mineral flotation due to these minerals already having similar levels of surface contamination within the two ore types. However, the formerly relatively clean molybdenite surfaces from the MZ ore are contaminated as a result of blending leading to a dramatically reduced flotation response.",

An aerated floc characterisation (AFC) technique was utilised for characterising the aggregates formed.

In the present work, we have measured the kinetics of film thinning using a modified thin film pressure balance (TFPB) technique by monitoring the interference patterns using a high speed camera. The results were analyzed using the Reynolds lubrication theory. It has been found that initially a TLF thins by the curvature pressure (pcur) created due to the bubble deformation and subsequently by the disjoining pressure (\u03a0) created by the surface forces in a wetting film.

     "abstract": "A proper characterization of upgrading results requires two material balance parameters, usually plotted as upgrading curves. It was presented in the paper that such pairs of separation result parameters have a certain degree of self-similarity defined as an extent to which one parameters is a part of the other. Some pairs of upgrading parameters have a significant degree of self-similarity. Upgrading curves based on such parameters are unsuitable for a simple statistical evaluation of separation results, especially when the determination coefficient R2 is used for this purpose. This is so because the R2 value can be as high as almost 1, even for highly scattered original data points. It results from comparison of nearly two identical parameters. It was shown in the paper that, for example, the upgrading curve relating the content of the considered component in concentrate less the content of the considered component in tailing and the content of the considered component in concentrate have the self-similarity approaching 99% on a 0 to 100% scale proposed in the paper. Other upgrading curves used in mineral processing have medium (between 50 and 60%) self-similarity, while the Fuerstenau plot, relating recovery of the useful component in concentrate and recovery of the remaining components in the tailing, has a relatively low self-similarity which changes with recovery from 0 to about 50%.",

SRB oxidize some carbon compounds anaerobically by reducing sulfate, in which electron donors are essential for the growth of SRB and the efficiency of biological sulfate reduction process. In this paper, influence of some electron donors on the growth and activity of SRB was studied. The carbon compounds tested included organic acids, alcohols, volatile fatty acid salts and carbohydrates. Results showed that sulfate-reducing activity decreases in the order of organic acids, volatile fatty acid salts, alcohols and carbohydrates. Considering the rate of sulfate removal and operating cost, the use of formic acid as an energy source in our experiments was found to be the most effective, resulting in 97% sulfate removal.",

However, carrying out experiments to fit flotation rate models are seldom undertaken on industrial flotation banks due to laborious sampling, preparation and analysis. In this work, in order to investigate the effect of particle size distribution of the feed of rougher cells on metallurgical characteristics at Sungun copper plant, the kinetics of different size fractions through rougher bank was studied by using both traditional and Yianatos methods. The Yianatos method depends on collecting samples from only five locations. It is indicated that the Yianatos method can be beneficial in kinetic rate constant determination for the whole size range and the results were compared with the traditional method.",

     "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the flotation behaviour of different particle size fractions in a flotation cell and their response to changes in flotation variables. The flotation behaviour of a particle size range can be estimated by using a common tool, flotation recovery versus particle size curve. However, interaction between the pulp and froth phases makes it difficult to differentiate the performance of the collection zone from the froth zone. In this study, a unique device has been used to measure the flotation efficiency of different particle size ranges in both the collection and froth zones simultaneously. Mixtures of fine (60\u00a0G silica, d80\u00a0=\u00a072\u00a0\u03bcm) and coarse (50\u00a0N silica, d80\u00a0=\u00a0299\u00a0\u03bcm) silica were used as feed. The influence of collector concentration, air flow rate, froth depth, and the ratio of fine to coarse particles in the feed on both the collection and the froth zone behaviour with respect to particle size has been investigated. The results show that the overall fine particle recovery is much higher than for coarser particles and less favourable conditions for optimum flotation efficiency are sufficient. The significance of the froth barrier to coarse particle flotation is also established. The important finding of this study is that the presence of fine particles can enhance the collection of coarse particles both in the collection and froth zones.",

An attempt was made to compare different phosphoric acid extractants viz. di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA), 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid-mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (PC88A), bis(2,4,4-trimethyl pentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex 272) vis-\u00e0-vis DNPPA, for the extraction of uranium from nitric acid medium. The effects of different experimental parameters such as aqueous phase acidity (up to 8\u00a0M HNO3), extractant and metal ion concentration etc. on uranium extraction were investigated. The presence of neutral oxodonors like TBP, TEHP, Cyanex 923 along with DNPPA showed synergistic enhancement in the extraction of U(VI) in the order: Cyanex 923\u00a0>\u00a0TBP\u00a0>\u00a0TEHP.

The appearance functions from the compression tests were found to take a linear form on logit axes (log(x/(xm\u00a0\u2212\u00a0x))), thus giving a simpler description than is available on other axes. In common with other breakage analysis methods the lines can be identified by the percent passing one tenth of the initial size, the t10 parameter. An exponential relation between t10 and specific energy was found for each particle group defined by size and density and the parameters of the exponential relation were related to the particle size and density. It was found for this particular coal that breakage did not preferentially concentrate either coal or mineral matter.The relations developed allow the generation of a three dimensional breakage-appearance function for the breakage of both size and density components which can be used in the simulation of a pulveriser for the coal tested. The paper also demonstrates the type of test work required for the generation of appearance functions for other types of coal.",

     "publication date": "03-2012",
     "abstract": "Flotation beneficiation of ores containing fibrous minerals is highly problematic due to transport of such gangue minerals from pulp to the froth phase. Earlier studies have attributed such transport to the entrainment of fibrous minerals. In this work, this problem is investigated for the case of flotation of ultramafic Ni ore with fibrous serpentines (Mg silicates) interfering with their separation. Serpentines are proposed to form large (~\u00a01\u20132\u00a0cm) networks in pulp and thus unlikely to be transported by entrainment. Various simulation based studies suggest that the networks are stable under the dynamic flotation conditions. Furthermore, the pores in the networks are relatively small (e.g. <\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcm\u2014SEM studies) for the bubbles (1\u20132\u00a0mm) to penetrate through the network of fibers in the pulp. This leads to the hypothesis that bubbles which cannot penetrate through the network accumulate below the network in the pulp with the buoyancy force of the bubbles thrusting the network to the froth phase. Model system studies were carried out with nylon fibers of size similar to that of serpentines. The phenomenon of bubble-flux driven transport of fibrous serpentines was clear from the model system studies, and is proposed to be the key mechanism of transport of fibrous serpentines to flotation concentrate.",

The proposed approach involves disintegration of the fibers by a combination of chemical (H2SO4) and mechanical (grinding) treatment adapting technology explored for CO2 sequestration. The use of H2SO4 also led to collectorless flotation traced to elemental sulphur formation, and release of magnesium increased solution ionic strength sufficient to eliminate the need for frother. Significant improvement in Ni grade-recovery with higher rejection of MgO-bearing gangue was achieved compared to untreated ore. Structural changes in the fibers were followed using spectroscopic techniques. A mechanism of fiber disintegration is suggested.",

This is partly due to the bridging action of the rods over the coarse particles avoiding the fine sizes (the grinding kinetics aspect), and partly due to the nature of material flow through the mill with its rod load (the material transport aspect). This article will stress mainly on the nature of material transport within the rod mill. It was found that the presence of rods minimizes the particulate segregation which is caused by differences in particle size and/or material density of the flowing components in the system. Segregation due to differences in particle shape (spherical versus natural particle shapes) and/or surface roughness was less affected in the presence of rods as stirring media in the system. The geometric restrictions on the axial and radial movement of the rods inside the drum, in addition to the restricted particle\u2013rod interactions affected the axial and radial dispersion of the material flowing through the rod mill. On the other hand, particulate segregation in the ball mill is almost eliminated among all material components different in size, density, shape, and/or surface roughness. Its product displays very good mixing under all operating and material conditions.",

The Stefan\u2013Reynolds lubrication approximation was used to estimate the forces from measured film thinning rates while the capillary wave model of Valkovska, Danov and Ivanov was used to calculate the forces from measured critical rupture thicknesses. It was found that at very low surfactant concentrations commensurate with typical flotation reagent dosage, the overall forces were attractive and up to one order of magnitude stronger than the Lifshitz\u2013van der Waals forces. The forces became smaller with increasing surfactant concentration. It was also found that the forces obtained from the capillary wave theory were indifferent to changes in film radii and surface mobility, in contrast to the Reynolds lubrication approximation. For comparison, other film drainage models considering film surface mobility and hydrodynamic corrugation were used to fit the present experimental thinning curves obtained at very low surfactant concentrations.

     "abstract": "The high-temperature structural behaviour of kaolin deformed by compaction and shear in a ball mill was investigated by extending the temperature range to 1500\u00a0\u00b0C. The deformation was induced for the first time with steps of low mechanical load through a specifically built planetary ball milling working in a controlled thermodynamic environment (25\u00a0\u00b0C and at a vacuum of 0.13\u00a0Pa). The investigated kaolin was made of about 65% of a well-ordered kaolinite, 10% of dickite and 25% of quartz. The mechanical energy transfer to the material was measured via the microstrain <\u00a0\u03b52>1/2 because we wanted to investigate the details of the evolution of the kaolin modification as a function of the microstrain.At the very early stage of milling (up to 1\u00a0h), no strain was accumulated in the kaolinite structure which, however, presented lamination, layer flattening and texturing. Further milling induced a progressive reduction of the stacking layer coherence and an increase of the microstrain, in both cases as a non linear function of the deformation time.The thermo-structural behaviour of kaolin was investigated by TG-DTA in a helium atmosphere at 10\u00a0\u00b0C/min of heating rate. In the medium temperature range (400\u20131000\u00a0\u00b0C), the mechanical milling affected the dehydroxylation reaction of kaolinite by a significant anticipation of about 300\u00a0\u00b0C of the temperature range, which usually occurs between 400 and 800\u00a0\u00b0C. Other reactions related to the formation of a Si-spinel and other intermediate phases were observed. The mechanical deformation severely influenced of the high-temperature reactions related to mullite and cristobalite formation. All thermal reactions linearly correlate to the microstrain <\u00a0\u03b52>1/2 accumulated in the kaolinite structure. The reported data are of particular usefulness in industrial applications involving grinding or milling of kaolin.",

     "abstract": "In a number of unit operations (e.g., leaching and dewatering) used for valuable metal (e.g., copper, gold) recovery from mineral ores, the process water quality may significantly impact on slurries' rheological behavior. In this study the effect of dissolved ions' type (Al(III), Fe(III), Cu(II) and K+) and concentration on muscovite slurries' interfacial chemistry modification and rheological behavior was investigated in the pH range 3\u201310 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C. At alkaline pH, specifically adsorbed metal ions and/or their surface nucleated hydroxide products dominated the particles' interfacial chemistry leading to formation of weak to moderate gelform slurry. The higher shear yield stresses displayed in the pH range 5\u201310, is attributed to enhanced van der Waals attraction and emergence of additional attractive forces (e.g., electrostatic-charge patch, adsorbed ion-particle bridging, surface nucleation and cementation). At pH\u00a0<\u00a04, however, the mineral surface chemistry changes were consistent with adsorbed hydrated metal ions and slurry displayed dispersed sol behavior due to repulsive hydration or structural forces. The extent of slurry shear yield stress enhancement/attenuation, induced by particles' zeta potential changes, strongly depended upon pH and metal ions' type and concentration. At high ionic strength (0.10\u20130.60\u00a0M), the metal ion mediation decreased in the order of Al(III)\u00a0>\u00a0Cu(II)\u00a0>\u00a0Fe(III)\u00a0>\u00a0K+ for zeta potential and Fe(III)\u00a0>\u00a0Cu(II)\u00a0>\u00a0Al(III)\u00a0>\u00a0K+ for pulp rheology. At low ionic strength (0.01\u20130.06\u00a0M), whilst the metal ion-mediated zeta potential changes followed the same order, for rheology enhancement it changed to Cu(II)\u00a0>\u00a0Al(III)\u00a0>\u00a0K+\u00a0>\u00a0Fe(III).",

This information was used to provide a detailed water chemistry analysis and to further understand how water quality affects the process. An analysis of the water chemistry of an operating selective flocculation-dispersion iron ore concentration plant has never before been published. The pH of the process water was the most important factor in the selective flocculation and dispersion process because, according to prior studies, it has a direct relationship with the surface chemistry of the particles (Carlson, 2010). The pH also had a direct relationship with the solubilities of both calcium and magnesium in the process. Water hardness was significantly increased with the addition of calcite/dolomite flux which may cause issues in pelletization and in the reuse water. Soluble iron was removed in the flotation circuit suggesting that it may have been oxidized during flotation or it may have been absorbed by the collector.",

     "abstract": "Application of microorganisms as surface modifiers in flocculation has generated a great deal of interest in recent times. The surface properties such as zeta-potential and hydrophobicity of minerals and microorganisms play a major role in determining the adsorption of microorganisms onto the minerals and hence the efficiency of flocculation. The utility of microorganisms, including Escherichia coli (wild-type and genetically modified strain Sip), Arthrobacter nicotianae, Bacillus licheniformis, and Pseudomonas maltophilia, has been evaluated by measuring their zeta-potentials and carrying out adsorption and flocculation experiments. Of the tested microorganisms, adsorption of E. coli strain Sip significantly modified the quartz surface. The zeta-potential of the quartz became highly positive at acidic pH, and its IEP (isoelectric point) was shifted from pH <\u00a02 to pH 4.3. Moreover, the settling velocity of the bio-treated quartz reached its maximum value at this pH. The number of cells adsorbed onto quartz was low at pH above the IEP due to the identical surface charges of the mineral and bacterial cells. This led to a repulsive force between the mineral particles and bacterial cells, which hindered the adsorption process. For all of the studied strains, the settling velocity of bio-treated quartz was high at their respective IEPs. An interaction model of microorganisms is proposed to explain the flocculation behavior of bio-treated quartz. Potential energies were calculated using the DLVO theory, and the results were found to be in good agreement with the flocculation tests. The settling velocity of the bio-treated quartz was maximized at pH close to the IEP of microbial cells. Interaction between cells is identified as the most likely cause of flocculation of bio-treated quartz.",

Contact angle, flotation (Hallimond tube), zeta potential and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to observe these effects and to investigate the mechanisms involved. The addition of sodium thiosulphate depressed both chalcopyrite and tennantite at all pH values. Further addition of diethyl dithiophosphate significantly increased the flotability of chalcopyrite at all pH values as well as tennanite in acidic conditions, but not tennantite in alkaline conditions. In light of the zeta potential measurements and due to the stability of thiosulphate over the pH range, the coverage of sulphate resulting from the oxidation of thiosulphate was responsible for the depression of both chalcopyrite and tennantite in acidic conditions. Adsorption of diethyl dithiophosphate species on the mineral surface resulted in flotability of tennantite which was almost as high as that of chalcopyrite. In alkaline conditions, coverage of the copper thiosulphate complex was responsible for the depression. The copper thiosulphate complex inhibited adsorption of diethyl dithiophosphate species on the mineral surface. Higher coverage of the copper thiosulphate complex on tennantite caused an insignificant increase in its flotability in comparison to that of chalcopyrite which allowed the separation of tennantite from chalcopyrite. The XPS spectra supported the proposed mechanism of thiosulphate depression on these minerals.",

The kinetics of barite carbothermic reduction was studied using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry. The experimental results revealed that the mechanical activation process improves the kinetics of barite carbothermic reduction. It was found that 3.6\u00a0ks of milling decreases the activation energy of barite reduction from 519 to 276\u00a0kJ/mol. This behavior can be explained considering the increase of reactants enthalpy due to the energy stored by the powders and the intimate contact between fine barite and coke particles promoted by the milling process.",

The powder XRD and Raman spectra analyses show that the degree of metamictization increases in the following order: Saigon (crystalline), Ohro (partly metamict) and Naegi zircons (fully metamict). Quantitative analytical results by the EMPA indicate that the Naegi and Ohro zircon samples contain a large amount of REE2O3, while REE2O3 contents in Saigon zircon are below detection limit. The leaching experiments using a solvent 1\u00a0M-HCl for the present zircons under the condition at a room temperature to 250\u00a0\u00b0C and retention time of 30\u00a0h resulted in about 100%, 50% and 1% recoveries of REE from the Naegi, Ohro and Saigon zircons, respectively. Leaching experiments for the Naegi zircon at different temperatures and retention time 30\u00a0h, showed that a significant amount of REE was leached out at the temperature above 150\u00a0\u00b0C, although REE were hard to be leached at a room temperature (about 25\u00a0\u00b0C). Therefore, both low crystallinity of zircon and higher leaching temperature are requisite for effective leaching of REE from zircon.",

The results of investigation indicate that the variables have significant influence on the performance of the separator; an increase in the magnetic induction and rotation speed of ring reduce the mass weight but increase the iron removal rate of nonmagnetic product, and the increase in the vibrating amplitude and frequency of ring cause a rise in the mass weight but a drop in the removal rate.

     "abstract": "The activation of pyrite by copper and lead ions is an important issue for the selective flotation of base metal sulfide minerals. In this study, the effect of electrochemical potential manipulated by reducing and oxidizing agents during grinding on the activation of pyrite by copper and lead ions was studied. Zeta potential measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) extraction as well as copper and lead solution speciation simulations were used to correlate pyrite flotation with the surface properties of copper and lead-activated pyrite. The electrochemical potential during grinding had a significant effect on the activation of pyrite by copper ions, but little effect on the activation of pyrite by lead ions. This phenomenon is explained by different activation mechanisms. The pyrite activation by copper ions is considered to be an electrochemical process involving the formation of new Cu+-sulfide species. The greater concentration of Cu+ species in the solution and the greater proportion of sulfide on the pyrite surface at the more reducing grinding condition favor the copper activation process. In contrast, pyrite activation by lead ions is not dependent on the electrochemical potential and this parameter does not affect the concentration of lead species adsorbed onto the pyrite surface regardless of surface pre-oxidation. Thus, these conclusions provide a guide as to how to control pyrite activation through the manipulation of electrochemical potential during grinding.",

An important quality parameter for lump ores is decrepitation, which has not yet been adequately studied. Herein, the physical, chemical and mineralogical characterizations of manganese lump ores from three main Brazilian mines, and from one important South African mine, are presented. After characterization, the samples were separated in three batches: one, as received; the second, after drying at 105\u00a0\u00b0C; and the third, after thermal treatment at 200\u00a0\u00b0C. They were then tested for decrepitation at the temperature of 700\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, with the particle size range kept between 19 and 6.3\u00a0mm. The thermal history influence was studied and related to the mineral families present in each ore, i.e., anhydrous-oxide, hydrated-oxide, and silicate\u2013carbonate. A significant difference amongst the decrepitation behaviors was observed for the lump ores from Azul, Urucum, Morro da Mina and Wessel mines. The ores from Wessel (I\u2212\u00a06.3\u00a0mm\u00a0=\u00a012%), Urucum (I\u2212\u00a06.3\u00a0mm=\u00a010%) and Azul (I\u2212\u00a06.3\u00a0mm=\u00a06%) present a high susceptibility to decrepitation, whilst the silicate\u2013carbonate from Morro da Mina shows no decrepitation. The presence of moisture increased the decrepitation intensity of the Azul, Urucum and Wessel lump ores. The bench-scale heat treatment reduced by more than 60% the decrepitation indexes of Urucum and Azul ores, but was not efficient enough when applied to Wessel ores.",

     "abstract": "There is increasing scientific and public concern about the use of synthetic chemicals which may enter the environment especially if they pose a risk to human health. Recent chemical legislation, requires industry to assess the hazards and risks of all chemical substances used in their operations, with increasing financial and legal implications. Chemicals are used intensively in chemical processing industries, agriculture and cleaning, and less intensively, in engineering, welding and woodwork.The mining industry relies heavily on the use of chemicals in most of its operations and it is now required to comply with specific chemical legislation, such as the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals) regulation, introduced by the European Union in 2007. Here we consider the state of the art of understanding the hazards and risks to human health and the environment associated with the use of synthetic chemicals as a basis for developing a risk assessment procedure for the mining industry. Several screening and risk assessment procedures, some used by chemical process industries are evaluated to determine their appropriateness for focusing on hazard identification and exposure estimation. Most of the procedures considered are for single substance assessments, or specific exposure scenarios, and these are used to develop a new framework for risk assessment for synthetic chemicals used in the mining industry, for which the following factors are important: i) the selection of hazardous property categories; ii) the method for scoring hazardous properties of the chemicals considered; iii) the assessment of data quality; iv) the identification of data gaps; and v) the reduction in the number of chemicals that need to be screened. It is important that the method developed must combine aspects of several of the available procedures if the needs of the mining industry in terms of accommodating the range of volumes, exposure scenarios, different uses, unknown mixtures, range of disposal routes and disparities in chemical housekeeping, are to be met. The final system developed, requires a systematic approach to identify which chemicals and ingredients in product formulations are on priority lists, or are likely to be so in the future, as a result of their hazardous or physicochemical properties. Moreover, the system developed must screen situations in which the chemicals are used, in order to determine the most high risk scenarios, so that appropriate measures to prevent and reduce accidents can be taken.",

In this paper we present a new method to improve rock classification using digital image analysis, feature selection based on mutual information and a voting process to take into account boundary information. We extract rock color and texture features and using mutual information we selected 14 from 36 features to represent the data in a lower dimensional space. The original image was divided into sub-images that are assigned to one class based on the selected color and texture features using a set of classifiers in cascade. Additionally, using rock boundary information, a voting process for the sub-images within the same blob is performed. We compare our results based on sub-image classification to those obtained after the voting process and to those previously published on the same rock image database. We show that the RMSE on rock composition classification on a test database decreased 8.8% by using our proposed voting method with the automatic segmentation with respect to direct sub-image classification. The RMSE decreased 29.5% relative to previously published results with the same database using a mixture of dry and wet rock images. The RMSE decreased even more if we considered separately dry and wet rocks. Our proposed method could be implemented in real-time to estimate mineral composition and can be used for online ore sorting and/or classification.",

     "abstract": "This paper examines the detachment of coarse particles from oscillating bubbles as a function of particle hydrophobicity and shape, as well as medium viscosity. The detachment experiments were conducted using a novel electro-acoustic technique for both ground quartz particles and spherical glass beads of various diameters and hydrophobicity. The detachment force for both types of particles, calculated from the maximum vibration amplitude at which a particle detaches from a bubble, increased with an increase in the contact angle of particles and viscosity of the suspending medium. At low vibration frequencies, the quasi-static model predicts the experimental detachment force reasonably well. In contrast, at high vibration frequency and, particularly, in high viscosity medium, the quasi-static model does not predict the experimental detachment force. It is hypothesised that the magnitude of the detachment force is determined by the dynamic contact angle, which is governed by the velocity of movement of the three phase contact line. Larger detachment forces were observed for the quartz particles compared to that of the spherical glass beads of the same size range and similar contact angle value.The stability of the bubble-particle aggregates at high viscosity has been related to the dynamic contact angle of particles. At high viscosity, the rate of movement of the three phase contact line, which governs the dynamic contact angle, is reduced thus resulting in more stable bubble-particle aggregates.",

We propose, also, an exponentially decreasing flow rate which is optimal from the mathematical point of view and the model being used. Due to the model simplicity, they can be used without mathematical complexities. We present a brief sensibility analysis to identify important operation variables that are relevant to change usual constant flow rates of lixiviant agents.

     "abstract": "Vibration is one of the mechanisms affecting bulk granular materials behaviour in transportation and material separation efficiency in pharmaceutical, chemical, food, mineral processing and other industries. Understanding fundamentals of vibration and their influence on bulk materials handling is gaining an increasing importance in the economies of scale. However, at present there appears to be no accurate and sufficient description of various phenomena observed in a granular material affected by vibration. This paper presents a concise review of physical phenomena observed in bulk granular materials affected by vibration, taken here as mechanical oscillations of relatively low amplitude and relatively high frequency. This includes three main characteristic regimes of vibration defined as vibro-fluidisation, vibro-compaction and vibro-boiling. The analysis of other factors influencing bulk granular material behaviour under vibration including air resistance, wave effects and particle oscillations decay are also given. A new characteristic regime of vibration is introduced, defined as vibro-hovering. Description of main characteristic vibration-induced bulk granular material states combined with the analysis of other contributing factors result in a more complete classification of vibration phenomena and an improved understanding of vibration-induced bulk material behaviour. Analytical conclusions are supported by the results of experimental studies, with significant potential for improvement in material separation efficiency indicated. Prerequisite vibrational parameters for effective bulk granular material flow promotion are discussed with a specific focus on physical separation processes and optimum ranges of vibrational parameters for separation and flow promotion of dry particulate matter are recommended.",

Analysis of the experimental results indicted that the leaching process is fitted by a chemical reaction model in temperature range 20\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C, and at higher temperature, 45\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C, the diffusion reaction model prevails. Activation energies for these models were calculated to be 49.5\u00a0kJ\u2219mol\u2212\u00a01 and 10.6\u00a0kJ\u2219mol\u2212\u00a01, respectively. Based on the experimental results, a separation method and flow sheet were developed and tested to separate high purity MnSO4.H2O (>\u00a099.4%). Comparison between the present results and that reported in the literature are given.",

     "abstract": "The effect of biosolids on hydrophobic properties of sulfides ores was studied. The principal components of biosolids are humic substances, mainly humic acid, and phosphorus compounds. The feasibility of using biosolids as collector for copper sulfide ores (CSO) was performed through zetapotential measurements, FT-IR analysis and film flotation tests. Addition of different dosages of biosolids, a commercial humic acid (CHA), and an industrial collector makes the zeta potential of a copper sulfide ore more electronegative in the entire pH range studied. FT-IR spectra show that CHA can interact with mineral surfaces through outer-sphere linkages. CHA can adsorb physically on chalcopyrite and pyrite through hydrogen bonds or Van der Waals forces. Orthophosphate, however, adsorbs chemically on the surfaces of these mineralogical species through inner-sphere linkages. Therefore, biosolids that contains both humic acid and phosphorus compounds can interact with CSO surfaces through a complex mechanism involving both inner and outer-sphere linkages. Further, film flotation tests \u2013 in accordance with zeta potential results \u2013 show that biosolids adsorb on the surface of the sulfide ores investigated, changing their hydrophobicity. Biosolids show greater affinity for pyrite while commercial humic acid show similar behavior to industrial collectors. Therefore, both biosolids and humic acids can change the hydrophobic properties of sulfide ores and can be used as collectors in froth flotation processes. Further research will be needed in order to scale-up laboratory results to industrial mineral operations.",

It was found that the NiFeO4 formed in the oxidation roasted Ni\u2013Mo ore was included by chemically inert iron silicates, which results in the NiFeO4 irresolvable in sulphuric acid.

The separation principle of the FDS is complex, hence it was decided to study separation based on size alone by considering interactions between different process parameters to predict the performance of FDS. The effects of four important operating parameters\u2014set point, teeter water flow rate, feed rate and pulp density of feed\u2014on the performance of the FDS have been studied through simulation. From the theoretical values, interaction between various process inputs has been studied.

Both calculated standard deviation (SD) of the measured turbidity data and results of an analysis of a digital image are used to discuss the effect of coagulants on the floc strength. The experimental results reveal that the diameter of flocs is strongly correlated with the SD values calculated from the collected turbidity data during the coagulation process. Also, the floc strength factor that is calculated from the turbidity SD is linearly related to the theoretical strength (\u03c3) that is obtained by analysis of a digital image. The strength factor, theoretical strength (\u03c3), floc strength coefficient (C) and stable size exponent (\u03b3) all follow the order cPAM\u00a0>\u00a0PACl\u00a0>\u00a0Alum in this study of kaolin coagulation.

Experiments are conducted on quartz, feldspar, kaolinite and pyrophyllite powders (0.1\u20132.5\u00a0\u03bcm) under acidic and alkaline conditions (pH 2.5\u20138).The adsorption of gold (supplied as HAuCl4) in acidic media is strong for all silicates evaluated. The maximum extent of adsorption was 100% for the layer silicates kaolinite and pyrophyllite, 97% for quartz and 51% for feldspar, after 7\u00a0h of moderate agitation at 50\u00a0g/L solids and 5\u00a0ppm initial gold concentration. The adsorption is rapid, and most of the gold is adsorbed from the solution within the first 2\u00a0h. In alkaline solutions, the gold adsorption was much lower than in acidic media, only reaching significant levels for the system containing pyrophyllite, which reached a maximum of 92% sorption after 5\u00a0h. Reversibility analysis at pH values of 0\u20131 does not show any gold trapped or physisorbed on silicate surfaces, indicating that chemisorption is the primary mechanism of gold loss from solution.The amount of sorbed gold in acidic environments is more closely related to the exposed surface area of the silicate solids than to the type of silicate. A much lower extent of adsorption by the same concentration of silicates at elevated pH further indicates that gold is not simply physisorbed to the surface, but rather that there is a chemical bonding between the silicate surface and gold complexes at low pH. The adsorption of gold in alkaline media may be the result of the development of colloidal gold particles associated with the silicate minerals. The correlation between dissolution of silicon and gold adsorption can also indicate that newly-formed silica gels are adsorbing gold from the solution.",

For ultrafine particles (<\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm), the metal loss in reverse cationic flotation is over 92% due to the entrainment of hematite ultrafine particles.

These factors are reviewed and discussed in relation to the flotation of copper sulphide minerals.Galvanic interactions between sulphide minerals and steel grinding media increase iron levels, lower the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry, and result in the formation of iron hydroxides. These changes can be deleterious to copper flotation. It has been shown that chrome alloy balls can have beneficial effects on flotation performance in some systems by limiting the formation of hydroxides in the pulp. As well, galvanic interactions between the sulphide minerals can occur, depending on the mineralogy of the ore, and they can influence the separation efficiency in flotation.While reagent additions, such as collector, lime, or cyanide, during milling can alter the pulp chemistry during grinding, there is little clear evidence in the literature that their addition during grinding has any strong influence on the subsequent floatability of copper sulphide particles.Improvements in copper recovery by flotation following fully autogenous milling in comparison with conventional milling using steel rod and ball mills at the same grind size have been noted in several laboratory and plant studies.",

Kinetic study was performed by fitting the three rate equations proposed in the shrinking core model (SCM) to the leaching data. A new approach was suggested to determine the rate controlling mechanism by applying a constrained multi-linear regression analysis using the least square technique. This technique takes into account all three possible rate controlling mechanisms for leaching processes (i.e., chemical reaction, diffusion through product layer and liquid film mass transfer) simultaneously and determines the controlling step(s) on its own. Results of kinetic study by this method showed that the rate of the first stage of fine particle leaching is controlled by diffusion through the liquid film and the second stage is controlled by chemical reaction on the unreacted core surface.

While the hematite iron ore showed close to an inert thermal behaviour, the goethite sample exhibited significant structural and thermochemical changes during heating at approximately 300\u00a0\u00b0C due to the breakdown of the hydroxyl bonds and release of water vapour. The associated strain in the particle caused by structural deterioration and crack propagation through the iron ore particle during heating was further modelled in this work. The model showed that cracks are initiated on the surface of the goethitic particle with crack propagation from the surface down to 20% of the particle diameter. Heating of iron ore particles in a fixed bed reactor did not produce particle fragmentation, however the structural changes during heating of the goethitic iron ore sample were so significant that the heating is expected to destabilise the particle structure and generate conditions favourable for particle degradation through mechanical or reduction induced particle deterioration.",

Particles smaller than 10\u00a0\u03bcm have a low probability of collision with bubbles, due to their tendency to be caught in streamlines created by a rising bubble. This review focuses on the techniques aimed at increasing the effective size of ultrafine mineral particles through aggregation, as an aid in improving flotation performance. These techniques are: shear flocculation, selective polymer flocculation and temperature responsive flocculation. Each technique is evaluated in terms of its mechanisms and its efficacy at improving the flotation of fine mineral particles.",

Altogether 11 sieve cuts of different materials are impacted in an experimental air jet mill. Minimum breakage energies are derived and are shown to vary with a power function of the sieve cut size.

     "abstract": "Kaolinite is of very fine particle size in nature and thus its dispersion plays a key role in the successful removal of kaolinite in iron ore flotation and selective flocculation processes. As the most widely used dispersant in the world, sodium silicate has been used as a standard dispersant in iron ore industry. However, in the author's previous work, the actual effect of sodium silicate on the colloid stability of kaolinite particles was found to be weak under the typical conditions of iron ore flotation and selective flocculation.In this work, the dispersive effect of a low molecular weight polyacrylic acid on kaolinite particles was systematically investigated through electrophoretic mobility and colloidal stability studies. The results demonstrate that interactions between polyacrylic acid and kaolinite take place over the entire pH range studied in this work, from pH 5 to 10.5, with stronger interactions observed at neutral and acidic pH. This indicates that polyacrylic acid adsorbs on both positively and negatively charged sites on kaolinite, although the presence of positively charged sites on the clay surfaces at low pH and in CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions at high pH significantly enhances its interactions with kaolinite. The strong dispersive effect of polyacrylic acid on kaolinite in the presence of CaCl2 and MgCl2 shows that polyacrylic acid is a promising dispersant for kaolinite under the typical conditions of iron ore flotation and selective flocculation.",

The method generates multiple, equally probable grade scenarios for the deposit, which reproduce the values of the samples, the histogram, and the variogram of the attribute being simulated. For a given mining plan, the set of simulated scenarios will generate a group of equiprobable values for each homogenization pile. These results provide the averages to assess a range of possible values each pile can have. To validate the suggested methodology, the contents of P2O5 obtained by the short-term mining plan and sampled at the processing plant from a large phosphate mine in central Brazil were compared against the simulated values. The average values sampled at the mill and the average values predicted by the short-term mining plan were compared against the space of uncertainty (range of possible grade values) generated by the proposed methodology. By comparing the simulated interval against the forecasted value planned by short-term mine planning block model 96% of situations included the real values. The results matched adequately demonstrating that geostatistical simulation and pile emulation methodology are efficient tools that could be applied in predicting grades in situ variability and in planning blending piles.",

     "abstract": "While pentlandite is the dominant nickel sulphide mineral recovered from nickel ores, other nickel sulphide minerals can often be present. One such rare but important nickel sulphide mineral is millerite (NiS). There is very little information in the literature about the flotability of millerite, in particular its flotation behaviour relative to that of pentlandite under different flotation conditions. This paper details a single mineral investigation into the flotability of millerite, and compares its flotability with that of pentlandite and other nickel arsenides often present in nickel sulphide ores.Millerite was found to be strongly flotable with xanthate collector at pH 9 but there was a noticeable decrease in recovery at pH 10 and a further decrease at pH 10.5. Size-recovery data suggests the recovery of millerite decreases at sizes above 75\u00a0\u03bcm and below 10\u00a0\u03bcm. In particular, fine millerite floats poorly in a similar fashion to fine pentlandite.At pH 9 with xanthate collector millerite exhibits a lower limiting threshold potential at about \u2212\u00a0100\u00a0mV SHE, about 300\u00a0mV below the lower limiting threshold potential for pentlandite.Millerite is not readily depressed by cyanide at pH 9 and further, cyanide doses required to affect depression are much higher than those required to depress the nickel arsenide mineral gersdorffite. Cyanide should therefore be a suitable depressant for the separation of gersdorffite from other nickel sulphide minerals such as millerite and pentlandite.",

Under these conditions, the mill environment remains self-similar and invariant which is a characteristic of the mill/material system. On the other hand, in industry, feed to the mill comprises oversize recycle and new feed that is highly heterogeneous and widely distributed in size. The objective of the present work is to compare the breakage kinetics and energetics of grinding coarse size feed in the presence of deliberately added fines for different material systems. Quartz, dolomite, and limestone mineral systems were selected as feed in order to study these phenomena for minerals whose hardness ranges from hard to soft, approximately from 7 to 3 on Moh's Scale of hardness, at different coarse/fine ratios. It was found that the cumulative breakage distribution functions for this situation do not change with mixture compositions for the three materials. On the other hand, the initial breakage rate function of the coarse particles increases with increasing proportion of fines in the mixture. It was also shown that the fines produced, and the coarse material retained on the top sieve were normalizable with respect to the specific energy consumed by the coarse fractions. A modified breakage rate function was used to simulate the grinding operation of the three material systems using the linear population balance model. As a result, reasonable agreement between the experimental data and the corresponding calculated values was achieved.",

Plant personnel believed less bentonite was required to make hematite pellets. Thus, the authors intended to quantify in-plant observations through bench-scale pelletization tests. As-received magnetite and as-received hematite were pelletized and tested for wet-drop number and dry-crush strength. Hematite pellets exceeded industrial minimum wet-drop and dry-crush values of 5 drops and 22\u00a0N/pellet without bentonite addition, while magnetite pellets exceeded industrial minimum values at a bentonite dose of 6.6\u00a0kg/t (0.66%). It is known that finer particles increase pellet strength, so additional magnetite was ground to a similar particle size distribution as the as-received hematite. The ground magnetite was pelletized and tested for wet-drop number and dry-crush strength. Wet drop and dry crush values increased after grinding the magnetite concentrate. However, they were significantly less than hematite pellets at similar bentonite doses. Consequently, particle size effects were not the dominant cause for higher strengths in the hematite concentrate.",

In the present study, effect of pellet basicity and MgO content on the melt formation and microstructure during the induration was examined. Fired pellets with varying basicity (0 to 0.8) and MgO (0 and 1.5%) content were tested for cold strength, reduction degradation index, reducibility, swelling and softening\u2013melting characteristics. Optical microscope studies with image analysis software were carried out to estimate the amount of different phases. SEM-EDS analysis was done to record the chemical analysis of oxide and slag phases. X-ray mapping was also carried out to understand the distribution of CaO, MgO, SiO2 and Al2O3 in different phases. From the results, it was observed that with increasing basicity, RDI and softening\u2013melting characteristics of pellets found to be improved. Addition of MgO to both acid and limestone fluxed pellets considerably reduced their swelling tendency. Improved pellet quality could be attributed to the formation of sufficient amount of silicate melt in basic pellets and high melting point slag in MgO pellets. Limestone fluxed pellets at 0.8 basicity, pyroxenite fluxed pellets at 1.5% MgO and dolomite fluxed pellets at 0.4 basicity & 1.5% MgO exhibited optimum metallurgical properties among all the pellets studied.",

For this purpose, a transferred arc plasma (TAP) torch was specially designed on laboratory scale level and the operating parameters were optimized in order to achieve a maximum percentage of mullite with time and cost effectiveness. The phase and microstructure formation of the processed samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The obtained results clearly show that the torch input power and processing time strongly influence the mullite microstructure and phase formation. The present TAP torch processing gives maximum percentage of mullite (95%) through sillimanite dissociation at 15\u00a0kW power level with 4\u00a0min of processing time.",

     "publication date": "05-2011",
     "abstract": "In conventional thickening operations, chemical reagents are added as coagulants or flocculants to improve the settling behaviour of suspended and colloidal solids. The effectiveness of these reagents depends on the nature and particle size of the solids. Poor settling may necessitate impoundment of the entire suspension, making land requirements exorbitant and imposing severe constraints on the plant water balance. The demand for fresh water increases as recycle of supernatant water from the thickening operation is curtailed. A bottleneck is created and plant capacity is effectively limited.In light of these considerations, alternating current electrocoagulation (AC/EC) came to be viewed as a potential alternative to chemical coagulation for treating suspensions produced in the mineral, coal and petroleum industries. Consequently, a detailed program of fundamental study was undertaken on the application of AC/EC to the enhancement of the settling behaviour of fine silica, which served as the model tailings solid.This paper reports on the study of the influence of agitation on the settling behaviour of silica that was treated by the AC/EC technique. The technique enhanced the initial settling rate of silica (1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03\u00a0cm/min) by over three orders of magnitude. Agitation was beneficial, but not essential, to this enhancement. Over the impeller tip speed range of 0 to 4.97\u00a0m/s, the initial settling rate of electrocoagulated silica was observed to be modestly sensitive to agitation rate, from which it may be deduced that silica formed strong flocs. Enhanced settling behaviour of electrocoagulated fine particles is manifested by their aggregation into flocs, as well as by their adsorption onto larger particles. In comparison tests, all of the aluminum added in chemical coagulation was precipitated in the sweep floc mechanism. This was not the case in electrocoagulation, which produced less voluminous sediment for the same Al dosage. In coagulation by specific adsorption, such as in electrocoagulation, zeta potential cannot be relied upon to track the progress of particle destabilization.",

The results of the flotation experiments showed that the presence of electrolytes in the system clearly enhanced the flotation recovery depending on its type and concentration. During the experiments, MgCl2 and NaClO3 solutions showed the highest and the lowest flotation performance improvements, respectively. The froth stability tests indicated that there is a correlation between the flotation recovery and the stability profile of the froth. The most stable froth was obtained with MgCl2 and the lowest froth stability was obtained with NaClO3. Additionally, a direct correlation was found between the flotation recovery and the bubble size distribution of the froth phase. The bubble size measurements revealed that increasing the electrolyte concentration decreased the bubble size, which, in turn, increased the flotation recovery. It is concluded that, the addition of salt solutions to a flotation system produces finer bubble size distribution at the froth phase, which enhances the coal flotation kinetics, depending on the type and the concentration of the electrolyte.",

With respect to SO2 reactivity, the deteriorated sorbents showed lower reactivity toward SO2 gas than an as-prepared sorbent. And the longer degradation time the hydrated lime sorbents were exposed to a humid atmosphere, the lower their SO2 reactivity became because the specific surface area of sorbents decreased from 41.23\u00a0m2/g to 15.23\u00a0m2/g. The calcite crystals formed in the deteriorated sorbents due to carbonation and the calcite crystals were grown with the elapse of degradation time. Accordingly, the SO2 removal efficiency of the deteriorated sorbents was lower than that of the as-prepared sorbent.

Evidence of a distribution of advancing contact angle values within each particle size fraction was found, and it was assumed that particles in the non-floating fraction had advancing contact angle values below the critical contact angle required for stable bubble-particle attachment. The flotation results were used to model the maximum recovery and the critical contact angle as a function of particle size, assuming a statistical distribution of contact angle values about a measured mean.

     "abstract": "Simultaneous optimization of the performance and simplification of flotation circuits using experimental approaches is almost impossible. The logical way is to use a mathematical model to describe the process as accurately as possible along with an appropriate optimization method. In this research the flotation process was modeled using first order kinetics approach with discrete-distributed rate constants. The contribution of non-selective particles transfer mechanism to the concentrate because of hydraulic entrainment was also considered. Then, genetic algorithm was applied for both optimization of the circuit performance and simplification of the circuit. Since there are only few appropriate solutions in the search space which sounds logical regarding the flotation process, the search routine was oriented to satisfy four process-based rules. One of these rules stated as concentrate and tailing streams must not recycle between two stages. The gene mutation which changed chromosomes in an intelligent way based on flotation process not only reduced the search time but also provided simpler circuits. The algorithm was applied for two optimization examples with the objective of achieving a desired concentrate grade within a specific total cells volume. The comparison of the results with the published data indicated that the proposed oriented genetic algorithm decreased the calculation time by 1/60 for a two-stage flotation system and provided a simpler circuit with a similar performance. The algorithm was then used to optimize a flotation circuit with four stages processing 100\u00a0t/h feed containing three species with high, medium and low rate constants.

Furthermore, the flotation response of pyrite, separately conditioned with KAX and DTP, was also evaluated under the same hydrodynamic conditions. When the advancing contact angle of chalcopyrite conditioned with DTP was the same (within 5\u00b0) as that of chalcopyrite conditioned with KAX, the flotation response was, within experimental error, the same. For both chalcopyrite and pyrite, heterogeneity of the advancing contact angle within the feed size fractions was demonstrated by significant differences in contact angle values measured on the flotation concentrate and tailings size fractions. The mean contact angle of the chalcopyrite and pyrite particles remained constant, within experimental error, through both flotation and sample preparation under the test conditions. The flotation response of chalcopyrite at 2% solids (w/w) was the same, within experimental error, as that at 30% solids (w/w) in the presence of silicate gangue, suggesting non-interaction of this gangue mineral with chalcopyrite under the test conditions. The operational advancing contact angles inferred for pyrite using the calibration established for the chalcopyrite-KAX system were, however, lower than the measured feed advancing contact angles, while the maximum recovery of pyrite was also lower than for chalcopyrite for the same feed advancing contact angle values, in the contact angle range less than 80\u00b0. The difference in flotation response between these two minerals for the same feed contact angle values was interpreted in terms of a difference in critical contact angle value for stable bubble\u2013particle attachment. The critical advancing contact angle values for the pyrite size fractions were higher than values for chalcopyrite for size fractions above 20\u00a0\u03bcm. This difference in critical advancing contact angle was attributed to the difference in mineral specific gravity between chalcopyrite and pyrite.",

The isothermal and non isothermal calcination assays were carried out in currents of N2 and a mixture of Cl2/N2 (1:1), using a thermogravimetric system designed in our laboratory and masses of approximately 300\u00a0mg. Isothermal assays were also performed with masses of 2\u00a0g, using a fixed bed reactor with horizontal dynamic flow. The initial samples of refractory clays and the residues resulting from thermal treatments were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), specific surface area analysis (BET) and CIELAB colorimetry.The thermograms in N2 and Cl2/N2 showed two mass losses, between room temperature and 650\u00a0\u00b0C, due to the elimination of the mineral hydration water and the transformation of kaolinite into metakaolinite. A third mass loss was observed over 750\u00a0\u00b0C in Cl2/N2 due to the chlorination and elimination of the iron contained in the samples. The X-ray diffractograms of the residues from the different thermal treatments showed that the calcination produced the total transformation of kaolinite and other phases contained in the mineral. The XRF analysis of the residues resulting from the isothermal assays in Cl2/N2 permitted to determine that the iron contained in the samples might be completely removed by chlorination at 900\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. The colorimetric analysis of the chlorination residues indicated that the discoloration and bleaching of samples were caused by the deferrification of the mineral. The results of the characterizations using SEM and EPMA supported the previous observations.",

     "abstract": "It is well-known that pyrrhotite is a slow floating mineral and there are many studies investigating its behaviour in the presence of pentlandite with which it most frequently occurs. In the treatment of massive sulphides the process often aims to depress the pyrrhotite whereas in other applications such as the treatment of platinum group elements (PGE) losses of the mineral may result in losses of PGEs as well as a reduced availability of sulphides required for smelter operation. The causes of pyrrhotite's poor floatability and reagent usage and the conditions encountered at the pHs typical of circuits treating pyrrhotite bearing ores are still a subject of considerable research. The present study was undertaken to measure the extent and rate of reaction of a relatively pure pyrrhotite sample using a standard xanthate collector at different pHs and conditioning times. The role of copper sulphate as an activator and guar as a depressant were also investigated. The effect of these treatments on the hydrophobicity of the pyrrhotite was determined by microflotation tests. This study has shown that under most conditions surface coverage of SIBX-originated species on the pyrrhotite equates to multi-layer coverage and that this is promoted by the pre-treatment with copper sulphate. Longer conditioning times increase surface coverage and recovery. Guar when added before copper sulphate using different addition regimes will depress the pyrrhotite. The findings and their significance for pyrrhotite flotation on flotation plants are discussed.",

Today, bentonites are used in different branches of industry, such as in drilling fluids, dyes, Pharmaceuticals, paper, cement, nanocomposites, polymer composites and ceramics. Bentonite dispersions are widely used in industrial processes because of their exceptional rheological behavior. In this work, the rheological behavior of three types of bentonites with different Na+/Ca+\u00a02 ratios was investigated. The bentonite dispersions showed Newtonian, Bingham plastic and shear thinning behaviors depending on the solid concentration and bentonite type. Although, all bentonite dispersion exhibited a thixotropic behavior, the Na-bentonite showed a greater degree of thixotropy which was two order of magnitudes greater than that of Ca-bentonite. The rheological behavior of bentonite suspensions developed significantly in the first 24\u00a0h of preparation. The addition of electrolytes in a concentration range of 0.02\u20130.2\u00a0M reduced the apparent viscosity of the bentonite suspensions and changed its rheological behavior from shear thinning to Newtonian and shear thickening. The divalent cation salts experienced more reduction in the apparent viscosity and yield stress of suspension than the monovalent cation salts.",

These methods are hydrogen reduction, electrochemical separation and acid stripping.

     "abstract": "Zeta potential is an important factor in affecting filtration rates of iron ore slurries. Two methods of zeta potential control investigated during this study were (1) pH adjustments and (2) surface modifications by reagent addition. It was originally hypothesized that adding CO2 to a hematite slurry, would form a carbonic acid, leading to lower pH levels, lower zeta potentials and increased filtration rates. Samples under both ideal (1\u00a0mM KCl as background electrolyte solution) and plant (plant water as background electrolyte) conditions were tested during this study. Through zeta potential testing of hematite slurries under ideal conditions (with and without CO2 sparging), it was observed that CO2 sparging achieved both (1) pH reduction and (2) surface modification of the hematite particles. While the shapes of the zeta potential curves were different for samples taken from the operating plant under plant conditions, the same downward shift in the entire zeta potential curve was observed after CO2 sparging. The surface modification phenomenon was attributed to the possible formation of complexes between carbonate/bicarbonate ions and the surface of the hematite particles. The possibility of double layer compression was also investigated. While some variations in conductance were observed, these variations did not entirely explain the changes in zeta potential, therefore providing even stronger evidence of surface modification through hematite/carbonate (or bicarbonate) surface complexing. In the event of a hematite/carbonate (or bicarbonate) complex forming, its exact composition is still unknown, but the surfaces showed zeta potential properties similar to that of a siderite (iron carbonate) sample analyzed during this study.",

     "abstract": "Cenospheres recovery is one of the coal fly ash beneficiations, providing economic as well as environmental benefits. Current techniques, such as lagoon or other wet-separation processes, consume large amounts of water and add to water pollution due to leaching of toxic materials from fly ash. The other possible disadvantage is the need for a wide operational area, which is unsuitable for densely populated countries. As wet-separation processes have some disadvantages, an improved and/or sustainable alternative recovery technique is required. An air classifier is one of the alternative techniques. In this study, two types of air classifiers, namely a closed-type pneumatic separator and a micron separator, have been investigated. In terms of separation efficiency, it was found that the micron separator has the potential to be applied in cenospheres recovery from coal fly ash, giving a Newton's efficiency of 0.44, as compared to a value of about 0.26 for the closed-type pneumatic separator. The cenospheres recoveries of both pieces of equipment at their optimum Newton's efficiencies were similar at over 60\u00a0wt.%. The separation performance was further assessed from the particle distributions of the overflow and underflow products obtained from both pieces of equipment, as well as from SEM images. It was found that the lower Newton's efficiency of the closed-type pneumatic separator was due to the re-concentration of fine particles in the underflow product at air-flow rates higher than 2.2\u00a0m/s (the underflow product yield was about 55\u00a0wt.%).In order to further confirm the applicability of this technique, the micron separator, which had provided higher separation efficiency and cenospheres recovery, was deployed in a cenospheres recovery unit prior to the use of a wet-separation process (float and sink tank). About 80% of the cenospheres was recovered, with an 87.8% reduction in the total mass of fly ash to be separated in the float and sink tank. Consequently, much less water was needed for the process of cenospheres recovery. Moreover, it was also confirmed that the micron separator could yield higher quality fly ashes, that is, fly ash types I and II, from lower feed quality of fly ash type IV, which is the lowest category in commercial classification of fly ash according to JIS A6201.",

     "abstract": "In this study, gold losses in a carbon-in-pulp (CIP) cyanidation gold recovery process and potential sources of these losses were investigated. Gold was found in samples from different streams through the CIP-cyanidation process, pointing to incidental losses. Mineralogical studies showed that gold losses occurred in two main forms, either as attached to larger entities or in the form of dendritic precipitates. SEM and EDS studies revealed that iron bearing minerals acted as the major media in cases when gold associations were observed as losses. The highly alkaline pH (\u2248\u00a013), elevated process temperature (\u2248\u00a0145\u00a0\u00b0C), and high cyanide concentration (\u2265\u00a0250\u00a0ppm) in the elution column along with a fine iron bearing material implied that gold attachment occurred through an electrochemical cementation mechanism. It was anticipated that the presence of iron in the process, which facilitated gold cementation, relied on the oxidative breakdown of the iron bearing minerals in the ore and/or due to the formation of porous iron oxides due to the roasting of iron sulfides in the regeneration kiln. In the elution column some part of the auro\u2013cyanide complexes would remain non-eluted and be discharged into the carbon generation kiln and the carbon generation kiln was another section promoting gold losses. The high temperature condition in the carbon regeneration kiln (>\u00a0500\u00a0\u00b0C) caused thermal reduction of the non-eluted auro\u2013cyanide complexes to metallic gold, leading to the formation of dendritic gold precipitates and their eventual loss.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine structural alterations of finely ground phlogopite, a trioctahedral mica, when exposed to acid, iron- and sulfate-rich solutions typical of bioleaching systems. Phlogopite suspensions were supplemented with ferrous sulfate and incubated with iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans) at 22\u00a0\u00b0C. As bacteria oxidized ferrous iron, ferric iron thus formed partially precipitated as K-jarosite. K-jarosite precipitation was contingent on the preceding ferrous iron oxidation by bacteria and the release of interlayer-K from phlogopite. This chemically and microbially induced weathering involved alteration of phlogopite to a mixed layer structure that included expansible vermiculite. The extent of phlogopite weathering and structure expansion varied with duration of the contact, concentration of ferrous iron and phlogopite, and the presence of monovalent cations (NH4+, K+, or Na+) in the culture solution. NH4+ and K+ ions (100\u00a0mM) added to culture suspensions precipitated as jarosite and thereby effectively prevented the loss of interlayer-K and structural alteration of phlogopite. Additional Na+ (100\u00a0mM) was insufficient to precipitate ferric iron as natrojarosite and therefore the precipitation was coupled with interlayer-K released from phlogopite. When ferrous iron was replaced with elemental sulfur as the substrate for A. ferrooxidans, the weathering of phlogopite was based on chemical dissolution without structural interstratification. The results demonstrate that iron oxidation and the concentration and composition of monovalent ions can have an effect on mineral weathering in leaching systems that involve contact of phlogopite and other mica minerals with acid leach solutions.",

Batch flotation tests were performed using a dithiophosphate-type of collector in different concentrations. Three flotation regimes were studied using particle size ranges of 20\u201338\u00a0\u03bcm, 75\u2013105\u00a0\u03bcm and 150\u2013210\u00a0\u03bcm. The individual particle contact angle, and hence, the distribution of contact angles of chalcopyrite within feed, concentrate and tail flotation samples has been determined using ToF-SIMS secondary ions. The effects of particle size and hydrophobicity on the flotation behaviour have been investigated using this new approach. The hydrodynamic effects of the particle size were highlighted by the different distributions of contact angles obtained for each concentrate size fraction, with fine and coarse sizes requiring higher average contact angles to float. This effect was overtaken by hydrophobicity when a high collector concentration was used. The broad distribution of contact angles observed in all samples, i.e. heterogeneity in hydrophobicity, has significant consequences for interpreting flotation behaviour. The methodology of analysis conducted in this study was applied to real ore and can be used as a quantitative, diagnostic tool for examining surface chemical factors affecting hydrophobicity. This new technique has promise and may advance the understanding of mechanisms, which may lead to better control strategies for improving flotation performance. Furthermore, any mineral\u2013collector system can be targeted, provided appropriate calibration is performed.",

It was found that in F150 the bubble slowed rapidly to reach the terminal velocity stage of the profile while in 1-pentanol the bubble remained in the deceleration stage and was consequently moving faster, at almost twice the speed. The lower rise velocity in F150 means longer bubble residence time and corresponding higher gas holdup than with 1-pentanol, as reported. In the second system, the bubble in MIBC reached terminal velocity more rapidly than in NaCl which agrees with the reported higher gas holdup in MIBC compared to NaCl.

The effects of H2O2 to-hydrolyzed titania residue mass ratio, leaching pH value, leaching temperature, leaching time, and H2O2 concentration on leaching of hydrolyzed titania residue by H2O2 are investigated. The recovery of Ti is above 98% under the optimal conditions. XRD shows that the peroxo-titania powder prepared by boiling the aqueous titanium peroxide solution is crystalline anatase phase. A well-crystallized anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 can be obtained through calcining at the temperature of 800 and 1000\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. EDS shows that the impurities including silicon are enriched in the leaching slag. Little Si is detected as the only impurity in the synthetic TiO2 due to the weak alkaline condition of leaching.",

Four different feeds with unnatural size distributions were designed to save grinding and sieving work. It was found that three size-intervals fitted the first-order breakage, but the coarsest interval did not. The non-first order breakage was most probably caused by the heterogeneity of the material. The heterogeneity was then confirmed by experiments. The breakage rate and the breakage distribution parameters were back calculated by treating the non-first order breakage as two linear segments according to the grinding time. The back-calculated breakage rates were in good agreement with the values calculated directly from the experimental data, and non-normalizable breakage distribution was observed. The model with the obtained parameters simulated the experimental product size distributions with good accuracy. These findings are valuable to the simulation and optimization of the industrial grinding processes of diasporic ores.",

Air was dissolved in either water or solutions of cationic, anionic, amphoteric or nonionic polymers at a constant pressure of four atmospheres. The charge of the bubbles at the shear-zeta plane was measured using a modified microelectrophoresis glass cell, held at a stationary level, at varying pH (2.0\u201312.0). Known practical problems with this technique were solved, and these solutions are described in detail. The anionic, amphoteric and nonionic polymers increased the negative charge of the bubbles, but the isoelectric point (iep) remained constant at about pH 2.0. Conversely, in the presence of the cationic polymer, the bubbles exhibited positive surface charges between pH 2.0 and 8.0 and an iep of pH 8.0. The results revealed the existence of an important interaction mechanism between air bubbles and polymeric macromolecules; neither this mechanism nor its practical implications have been reported in the literature to date, especially in the treatment of wastewater by flocculation followed by dissolved air flotation (DAF).",

It was observed that fine galena and chalcopyrite (\u2212\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm) were affected by iron oxidation species emanating from grinding media to a much greater extent than intermediate size fractions (+\u00a010\u201353\u00a0\u03bcm), and that grinding conditions had a more pronounced effect on fine galena flotation than fine chalcopyrite flotation. Mechanisms were investigated by rest potential measurement, ToF-SIMS analysis, mineral dissolution study and zeta potential measurement. It appears that fine particles (\u2212\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm) are more easily oxidised than intermediate particles resulting in a higher concentration of metal oxidation species. Oxidation of galena and chalcopyrite enhances adsorption of iron oxidation species at pH 9 by electrostatic interaction.

The successful geopolymerization of honeycomb briquette ash was attained by means of NaOH treatment. The concentrations of the major and minor elements of honeycomb briquette ash are in the normal range of the chemical composition of fly ash and appropriate for the synthesis of geopolymers. Honeycomb briquette ash contains 9.88\u00a0wt.% unburned carbon, however, all but 0.04% of the unburned carbon was removed in clean ash by means of a froth flotation process. The development of the compressive strength of the geopolymer bodies is affected by the unburned carbon content, the molar concentration of the NaOH solution, the curing temperature, and the curing time. With a few exceptions, a high compressive strength was achieved for the unburned carbon-free ash-based geopolymer bodies regardless of the curing temperature and the curing time. A geopolymer body was prepared by the dissolution of unburned carbon-free ash in 12\u00a0M of NaOH solution and curing at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 7\u00a0days. Under these conditions, the compressive strength of the geopolymer body increased to 65.63\u00a0MPa. This value is almost double the highest value of a geopolymer body, prepared by the dissolution of as-received ash in 12\u00a0M of NaOH solution and curing at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 28\u00a0days. In conclusion, unburned carbon-free honeycomb briquette ash could be an alternative to Portland cement as a prospective cementitious material.",

It is found that in general, liquid flowrate is greater when the relative humidity of the air above the foam is high. This observation is attributed to bubble coalescence on the surface of the foam. Because the evaporation rate is diminished when the relative humidity is high, less bubbles collapse on the surface of the foam. Because no experiments have been conducted on mineralised flotation froths, a dependency on the operation of froth flotation devices on environmental humidity cannot be directly asserted; although the effect is so important in demineralised foams that it should not be overlooked in the context of flotation.

The objective of this investigation is to study the breakage kinetics and energetics of grinding coarse size feed in the presence of deliberately added fines. Quartz and limestone mineral systems were selected as feed in order to study these phenomena for minerals whose hardness ranges from hard to soft at different coarse/fine ratios. It was found that the cumulative breakage distribution function for this situation does not change with mixture composition. On the other hand, the initial breakage rate function of the coarse particles increases with increasing proportion of fines in the mixture. This acceleration could be due to the smaller collision cross-section of the fines. In addition, the coarse particles appear to be preferentially present at the toe of the mill where most of the grinding takes place.",

     "abstract": "The floatability component method is a useful technique for modelling flotation. A floatability component is a mathematically grouped set of particles that display a similar flotation rate, but otherwise do not necessarily possess common physical characteristics. This means that it is currently not possible to determine floatability components from physical properties of the feed stream prior to flotation. The current study aimed to assign physical significance to floatability component model parameters to assist linking comminution, classification and flotation models.Floatability component model parameters (flotation rates and corresponding mass fractions) for galena in the feed stream to a 40-L continuous flotation cell were determined concurrently with the measurement of a property-based size-by-liberation floatability distribution. Two floating and one non-floating components were derived and visually compared to the floatability distribution. It was found that the derived components provided an adequate approximation of the shape of the distribution. From this comparison, size-by-liberation particle classes were designated fast, slow or non-floating, thus determining the physical attributes of particles within the floatability components.These results show that the components derived using the floatability component method possessed physical significance, and that a continuous spectrum of rates could be usefully simplified to a number of discrete components. Using this technique it would be possible to re-assign floatability components following a change to feed stream properties (such as grade, particle size and composition), instead of re-deriving them. A simple approach for validating the technique is put forward.",

The kinetic data were analyzed by finding their fitness to the well-known Lagergren and pseudo-second-order models using linear and non-linear curve fitting methods. Equilibrium isotherms generated were tested by applying Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models using both linear and non-linear methods. The optimum contact time and agitation speed were found to be 60\u00a0min and 600\u00a0rpm, respectively. The presence of sodium chloride ions in solution drastically reduced the cadmium uptake. On the other hand, higher pH and temperature enhanced sorption. The non-linear curve fitting analysis method was found to fit the data better than the linear method.

To avoid ore resource waste and save the separation cost, it is noteworthy that different size fractions of Jordanian phosphate ore produced by sieving should be processed by different methods. The 74\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm size fraction which has fewer gangues than coarser and finer size fractions is treated by scrubbing to increase P2O5 grade up to 30%. The coarser size fraction (>\u00a0300\u00a0\u03bcm) requires secondary grinding. The finer size fraction (<\u00a074\u00a0\u03bcm) with 23.85% P2O5 grade is processed by flotation to remove quartz gangue. The acid conditions can improve the flotation performance remarkably. The dissolution of carbonates at low pH value facilitates the quartz flotation. At pH 4.8, the P2O5 grade, P2O5 recovery and quartz removal ratio are 30.82%, 82.00% and 62.20%, respectively. Calcination can be employed to separate calcite gangue; however, it should be applied after quartz flotation to avoid the formation of CaSiO3 phase. To improve the flotation performance, the amount of <\u00a045\u00a0\u03bcm particles should be reduced, and an alternative method is avoiding over-grinding.",

The effect of calcium and magnesium on starch adsorption on kaolinite surfaces correlates to their abilities to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic starch molecules and the negatively charged kaolinite particles. The hydrolyzable metal cations cause fast coagulation of kaolinite particles at pH 10.5 by reducing the repulsive electrostatic forces between kaolinite particles, when their concentration is \u2265\u00a00.001\u00a0M.

Currently, machine vision has been implemented on several industrial sites worldwide and the technology continues to benefit from advances in computer technology. Effort continues to be directed into linking concentrate grade with measurable attributes of the froth phase, although this is proving difficult. As a result other extracted variables, such as froth velocity, have to be used to infer process performance.

     "abstract": "For technological design and operation of hydrocyclone classification a separation model should be available, which largely comprises the physical phenomena of the process, reflects their effects by appropriate process parameters and can be mathematically formulated as separation function. The most models, which are known so far, do not meet these requirements in their entirety. In the main they have been empirically formulated and/or do not reflect that the separation effect, caused by the centrifugal field, is superimposed by an intensive mixing effect caused by the macroturbulence of the hydrocyclone flow. Only the models of turbulent cross-flow classification, which are adjusted to the conditions of hydrocyclone classification in dilute suspensions, come in the form of the tapping model or partition model close to the satisfaction of the demands mentioned above.After outlines of the characteristics and the transport phenomena of turbulent flows as well as of the indispensable simplifications and adjustments to given materials, geometrical and hydrodynamical properties, the model derivation is described. In particular the wide range of the rheological properties of the feed suspensions as well as the phenomena of turbulence damping cause restrictions regarding the quantification of the model predictions. Further improvements of the model predictions are only attainable by means of empirical adjustment corrections. In order to ensure an adequate reliability of the correction factors, they should be determined using similar material systems and also similar hydrocyclones. Meanwhile several working teams have successfully tested the efficiency of such models for dilute flow classification.The first and so far only known model development for dense flow classification in hydrocyclones starts from the fact that the operation space must be divided into two subspaces and thus also two subprocesses, namely the sediment formation in the outer subspace and the formation of the radial concentration profiles of the particle sizes in the inner suspension subspace. Progress in this field necessitates further research.The so-called fishhook effect is based on flow forces, which cause an enrichment of finest particles in the zones of the velocity gradients around settling coarser particles in a certain Re-range, and superimposes the turbulent cross-flow classification.",

In this work, numerical simulations based on the discrete element method (DEM) were performed to investigate the particle flow in a dry stirred mill with a similar configuration to that of an IsaMill\u2122. The effects of operational variables such as mill loading and rotation speed on flow properties such as flow velocity, power draw, collision frequency, collision energy and total impact energy were analysed. The results showed that increasing mill loading or mill speed increases impact energy between particles. Moreover, physical experiments were conducted to quantify grinding performance under similar conditions. The experimental results showed that the grinding in the mill follows the first order kinetics, and the rate constant can be correlated to impact energy. The findings are useful to understand and optimise the particle flow and grinding behaviour of IsaMills\u2122. The proposed methodology may also apply to other stirred mills.",

     "abstract": "A technique named Aerated Flocs Characterization (AFC) was developed and validated to characterize multiphase systems that are formed in flocculation\u2013flotation (with microbubbles) systems at laboratory scale. Synthetic polyacrylamides were used to flocculate dispersed particles models of kaolin, activated carbon and iron hydroxide colloidal precipitate, Fe(OH)3. Aggregation and solid/liquid separations were conducted in a dissolved air flotation (DAF) apparatus, which consisted of a flotation cell connected by a release needle valve to a pressure vessel, employed for water saturation at 4\u00a0atm and microbubbles formation. The aerated flocs exhibited very rapid rising rates (>\u00a060\u00a0mh\u22121) as a result of bubbles adhesion, bubble surface nucleation and bubbles growing and entrapped inside the flocs. All these conformations may adhere or lead to the formation of very light (low density) flocs. The number of bubbles attached or entrapped inside the flocs determines the aeration degree in the so-called aeroflocs, property which depends, among others, on solids type (hydrophobicity); this being very noticeable when compared to activated carbon particles with the less hydrophobic model suspensions. The size distribution, up-rising rates, shape factor, fractal dimension and density of the flocs were determined using this image analysis technique. In addition, the bubble positioning, floc structure and bubble size were monitored. The AFC technique was found to be very reliable showing high statistical reproducibility and appears to have a good potential to characterize particles, aerated flocs and bubbles.",

     "abstract": "The processing of lunar regolith for the production of oxygen is a key component of the In-Situ Resource Utilization plans currently being developed by NASA. In the carbothermal process, a portion of the surface of the regolith in a container is heated by exposure to a heat source so that a small zone of molten regolith is established. A continuous flow of methane is maintained over the molten regolith zone. In this paper, we discuss the development of a chemical conversion model of the carbothermal process to predict the rate of production of carbon monoxide. Our model is based on a mechanism where methane pyrolyzes when it comes in contact with the surface of the hot molten regolith to form solid carbon and hydrogen gas. Carbon is deposited on the surface of the melt, and hydrogen is released into the gas stream above the melt surface. We assume that the deposited carbon mixes in the molten regolith and reacts with metal oxides in a reduction reaction by which gaseous carbon monoxide is liberated. Carbon monoxide bubbles through the melt and is released into the gas stream. It is further processed downstream to ultimately produce oxygen.",

     "publication date": "09-2010",
     "abstract": "A novel system based on membrane contactor was applied for separation of iron ions during leaching of ilmenite ore in hydrochloric acid. Separation of iron would enhance leaching of ilmenite and leads to pure titanium products. The used membrane contactor cell consisted of two identical compartments separated by a porous flat sheet membrane. The ilmenite leachant was separated from the residue and placed in one compartment (marked as feed side) and an organic solution containing a selective iron extractant was placed in the other compartment (marked as receive side). Among the several tested organic extractants, trioctylamine (TOA) was found to be effective and selective for extraction of iron ions from solutions of a wide range of hydrochloric acid concentrations. TOA in kerosene and 10% 1-octanole was used as a receive phase in the membrane contactor cell. Two types of membrane materials were tested; polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polypropylene (PP) with almost similar pore sizes of about 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm. Multi separation stages by the membrane contactor were applied by replacing the receiving solution with a fresh one after 180\u00a0min of separation time. High Fe removal efficiency of about 86% after 4 separation stages using 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm PP membrane was obtained. The transport mechanism of iron was proposed mainly based on ionpair (R3NH+FeCl4\u2212) formation in the aqueous\u2013membrane interface and its diffusion to the organic pulp through the membrane. The separation of the aqueous and organic solutions by a membrane in this contactor technique overcame the common drawbacks of the solvent extraction such as losses of the organic reagent, emulsion formation and delay of phase separation. In other procedures, the ilmenite slurry suspension was placed as it is in the feed side of the cell to test the possibility of the continuous separation of iron during leaching. The Fe removal efficiency was found to be very low (8% after 3\u00a0h) due to fouling of the membrane. A brownish precipitate was observed on the feed side of the membrane and was growing by time leading to slowing down of the Fe transport rate. Thin Film XRD test of membrane fouling showed that Goethite \u03b1-FeO(OH), Feroxyhyte \u014d-FeO(OH) and iron oxy chloride (FeOCl) are the main constituents of the precipitate. In addition, SEM photomicrographs showed that the precipitated particles on the membrane surface are sphere in shape with size ranged from 1 to 2\u00a0\u03bcm.",

In this study, process experiments for modeling of the grinding circuit were carried out. Then multivariable-PI, fuzzy, and model predictive controls were evaluated with the simulated process.

Additionally, the collectors were evaluated via zeta potential and FTIR analyses. The flotation performance of the collectors was evaluated using a laboratory mechanical flotation cell at different process parameters such as pH, collector dosage, diesel dosage and flotation time. The two collectors evaluated were a commercial plant collector and a refined tall oil fatty acid. The QCM-D data showed that the refined tall oil fatty acid adsorbed on phosphate more readily and produced stronger hydrophobicity and better flotation performance than the plant collector. The chemisorption and surface precipitation mechanisms of the refined tall oil fatty acid on the surface of hydroxyapatite were demonstrated by means of zeta potential measurements and FTIR analysis.",

The tests are executed by introducing NaNO3 to the decomposition process of chromite ore in molten NaOH to decrease the decomposition temperature. An interesting result is that the reaction temperature could decrease from above 500\u00a0\u00b0C to about 400\u00a0\u00b0C, and sodium nitrate has no consumption in the oxidation process, while the Cr yield is above 99%. Mechanism analysis shows that chromite ore is firstly oxidized by NaNO3, where NaNO2 is generated as a reduction product, and then is oxidized to NaNO3. NaNO3 plays the role of oxygen carrier, which can reduce the mass transfer resistance of oxygen. The kinetic study shows that the decomposition process was an internal diffusion controlled, with an apparent activation energy of 106\u00a0kJ/mol.

Particle diameter and density were determined by sieving industrial cenospheres and coal fly ash type IV, the model particles. This information was then utilized to calculate the terminal velocity needed to estimate the separation performances of both the wet and dry separation processes. Based on this estimation, the dry separation process performed similarly to the wet separation process, with an optimum Newton's efficiency of 0.54, only slightly lower than that of the wet separation process of 0.6. Moreover, it was observed that the cenospheres were concentrated in the underflow product, whereas for the wet separation process the reverse was true. The findings of this assessment were verified using a micron separator. Similar tendencies in the concentration of cenospheres in the underflow products were obtained. An optimum Newton's efficiency as high as 0.44 was achieved, with 66% recovery of the cenospheres. The recovery of the cenospheres was only 4% lower than the estimated value (70%), from which we conclude that dry separation processes are interesting technologies to apply to the recovery of cenospheres from coal fly ash because of their high efficiencies.",

     "abstract": "There is little published literature on the design and operation of rakes in gravity thickeners. In practice, design principles and operating guidelines rely heavily on experience and are usually qualitative in nature. In some industry applications, in particular in minerals processing, raking can be a rate-limiting step, with high rake torque, rake \u201cbogging\u201d, rat-holing and insufficient underflow density all attributed to poor rake design or operation. In this paper we define and discuss a range of efficiency measures that allow different aspects of raking in gravity thickeners to be quantified. We undertake Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations in a model of the settled bed in a 45\u00a0m diameter thickener and apply these measures to the simulation results in order to illustrate the information that they provide. The measures suggest that the ratio of rake delivery and underflow rate plays a key role in designing a rake system. Other important factors to consider are the relative delivery of neighbouring rake blades, drag forces that determine rake torque and the degree of \u201cswirl\u201d motion imparted to the bed. All of these factors can be taken into consideration to modify and improve rake design and operation. Rake speed affects delivery to the underflow but does not play a significant role in other performance measures so can (in principle) be adjusted to balance the desired underflow rate and rake delivery without affecting performance. The results of this paper suggests that the application of a validated CFD raking model coupled to the use of raking efficiency measures is a good starting point for the quantitative assessment of design and operation of thickener rakes. The results also suggest that pilot-scale raking studies are a valid approach when investigating raking on the full-scale.",

     "abstract": "Particulate systems, powders, are involved in several important industries such as cement, fertilizers, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and metallurgical industries. The particulate systems, handled and/or processed in these industries usually consist of non-homogeneous components, that is, their constituents are heterogeneous in their physical properties such as particle size, density, particle shape, and surface roughness. Handling and processing of these systems during transport and/or manufacturing, is usually associated with movements of these particulates during transfer points, shaking, moving through drums or reactors, or sliding over inclined planes, that is to say, it is imperative to energize, disturb, these systems during handling and/or processing. This disturbance results in mutual separation of the particulate constituents because of differences in their physical properties. The mutual separation is a natural phenomenon called \u201csegregation\u201d. In some instances, segregation is desirable, while in most cases it is detrimental. Segregation in particulate systems takes place as a result of several forces, mainly frictional and gravitational forces, acting on the individual particles inside the system while it is externally energized. These forces are functions of differences in the physical properties of the constituting components. This paper deals with investigating and discussing the mechanisms of particulate motion and the role of the acting forces during the flow of a non-homogeneous particulate system in a rotating drum, and the effect of these differences on the quality of the final product. It deals with the effect of particle shape and roughness, and particle size. Both of them lead to mutual segregation of the particulate system components.",

Using UV spectroscopic analysis, the butyl xanthate has been found to adsorb on pyrrhotite to form estimated 1.3 to 3.1 equivalent monolayers at initial concentrations of 5 to 10\u00a0ppm, respectively. SMBS is found to be capable of decomposing xanthate to carbon disulphide in pyrrhotite suspension bringing the number of equivalent monolayer down to less than 0.5. A highly significant level of xanthate elimination in the pyrrhotite slurry has been observed. The same phenomenon has also been observed in the presence of TETA as an effective chelator for metal ions suspected of inadvertent activation. Under such conditions, dixanthogen cannot form on pyrrhotite as a sustainable hydrophobic species. TETA itself also appears to be reactive towards xanthated pyrrhotite surface causing release of sequestered surface species into the aqueous phase. However, this effect is not destructive for xanthate and the results suggest re-adsorption of the released species in time. It is concluded that the modulating effect exerted on xanthate as a collector and on potential metal ion activity is a critical part of the joint action of the sulphite ions and polyamines, respectively.",

In this work, the adsorption behaviour of starch on kaolinite surfaces and the flocculation/dispersion of the kaolinite particles coated with starch were investigated through adsorption and turbidity measurements. It was found that starch adsorption on kaolinite is pH dependent, with starch adsorption decreasing with increasing pH from 7 to 10.5. At pH 10.5, increasing ionic strength significantly enhances the adsorption density of starch on kaolinite. The enhanced starch adsorption at lower pH and higher ionic strength was attributed to the reduced electrostatic repulsion between the anionic starch molecules and the negatively charged kaolinite particles as pH and ionic strength change.The steric stability of kaolinite particles was found to depend on the adsorption behaviour of starch on kaolinite surfaces. In the presence of starch, bridging flocculation of kaolinite particles is rather weak in distilled water at pH 10.5, since starch shows an extremely low affinity towards kaolinite. However, at lower pH or in the presence of electrolytes, when starch shows a higher affinity towards kaolinite surfaces, starch starts to play a significant role in the aggregation of kaolinite particles through bridging flocculation of the mineral particles at low starch dosages and by inducing steric stability of kaolinite at higher starch dosages. When the ionic strength decreases to 0.00001\u00a0M NaCl, no effect of ionic strength on starch\u2013kaolinite interactions was observed.",

     "abstract": "The effect of frother and NaCl salt on the shape and velocity of a ca. 2.4\u00a0mm diameter bubble close to the generation point at an orifice was studied using high-speed imaging. Bubbles accelerate to reach a maximum velocity at a given time depending on frother type and concentration, followed by deceleration and then oscillation about a mean velocity. A relationship between bubble shape and velocity is observed: the more spherical the bubble, the slower the rise, which is in agreement with recent literature. The findings support the argument that surfactants may affect bubble rise velocity through control of bubble shape.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to characterize ferric iron precipitates formed in batch experiments over a temperature range of 2 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C from ferric sulfate and mineral salts in sulfuric acid. With the exception of elevated levels of K+ to promote jarosite [KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6] formation, the solution composition was intended to simulate fully oxidized bioleaching solutions. Iron-oxidizing acidophilic bacteria were not included in the system. The solutions were held for 10\u00a0days in a thermal gradient incubator with a 1.65\u00a0\u00b0C temperature interval followed by analyses of the residual solutions and precipitated solid phases. The loss of dissolved Fe3+ through solid-phase precipitation increased with temperature, consistent with the expected temperature-dependency of the rate of precipitation. Hydronian jarosites [(K,H3O)Fe3(SO4)2(OH)6] were the main phases identified in all samples by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, but a K and SO4 enriched phase similar to Maus' salt [K5Fe3(SO4)6(OH)2\u00b78H2O] was also detected in some samples, mostly those formed at sub-ambient temperatures (<\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C). Background areas from XRD powder patterns decreased in a linear fashion with increasing temperature of synthesis, suggesting improved crystallinity of the solid phase at the expense of an X-ray amorphous fraction. Spacing differences (\u03942\u0398) between the intense (113) and (021) peaks confirmed the hydronian character of the jarosite phase. The jarosite lattice parameter a0 decreased whereas c0 increased with the synthesis temperature, indicating that H3O+ substitution for K+ in the jarosite structure was favored at low temperatures.",

It is highly beneficial to understand major biooxidation mechanisms with reference to solution- and mineral-grown cells in order to optimize bioleaching reactions.For A. ferrooxidans grown in the presence of solid substrates such as sulfur, pyrite and chalcopyrite, bacterial adhesion is required for its enzymatic machinery to come into close contact for mineral dissolution. But when grown in solution substrate such as ferrous ions and thiosulfate, such an adhesion machinery is not required for substrate utilization. Proteinaceous compounds were observed on the surface of sulfur-grown cells. Such an induction of relatively hydrophobic proteins and down regulation of exposed polysaccharides leads to changes in cell surface chemistry.

As an alternative the \u201cbio-reduction\u201d of pyrite is proposed and investigated in this study. Bio-reduction is an anaerobic process based on sulfate/sulfur reducing bacteria which are thought to be able to use pyrite-sulfur as a possible electron acceptor. The conversion of pyrite-sulfur into hydrogen sulfide is advantageous because energy is saved and the generation of an acidic waste stream is prevented. In addition, the generated H2S can be used to produce elemental sulfur, or even gold lixiviants such as thiosulfate or bisulfide. Batch experiments under anaerobic conditions showed that two effects can inhibit bio-reduction; methane formation and sulfide accumulation. In a gas lift loop reactor operated at pH 5, temperature of 35\u00a0\u00b0C, and with continuous sulfide removal no evidence of pyrite bio-reduction was found. Though the sulfate reducing bacteria survived, they did not utilize pyrite-sulfur as an electron acceptor under the chosen conditions.",

The camera collects sequences of images recorded at 2\u00a0ms intervals at 1280\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01024\u00a0pixel size.

The bubble trajectory is reconstructed from the data structure; up to 60,000 matching bubbles can be tracked per test. The bubble tracking measurements revealed a velocity\u2013size relationship with some of the following features: faster moving bubbles speed up slower moving ones whether larger or smaller; a large population of slow moving fine bubbles slows all bubbles; surfactant type affects velocity, equivalent size bubbles in Polyglycol moving slower than in n-Pentanol.

Particle shape and surface roughness are considered important parameters in the prediction of the behavior of particles individually or collectively.

Therefore, this research is concerned with the different methods used to estimate the particle shape and surface roughness and also to relate these parameters with the behavior of some mineral processing operations, especially comminution and flotation processes.The surface roughness of mineral particle influences the fundamental processes of particle\u2013bubble attachment and the other sub-processes in froth flotation. The contact angle is dependent on the surface roughness. The modification of the wettability due to surface roughness can be greatly enhanced in the fractal surface; that is the fractal surface will be superrepellent (superwettable) to a liquid when the contact angle is greater (less) than 90\u00b0. Correlations were found between the shape properties, surface roughness values and wettability.The dry grinding produces relatively rough particle surfaces with a high concentration of microstructural defects while the wet grinding produces smoother cleaner surfaces.

     "abstract": "A diagnostic leaching showed that partial oxidation of the sulphide minerals in a gold ore was beneficial for thiosulphate leaching of gold. A pre-treatment process with oxidative ammoniacal solution enhanced the thiosulphate leaching of the sulphide ore, while the thiosulphate consumption was substantially reduced. The sulphide minerals partially decomposed in the pre-treatment process, exposing gold to the leach solution. Oxygen input by air bubbling and a longer contact time enhanced the oxidative ammonia pre-treatment process and hence accelerated subsequent thiosulphate leaching of the sulphide ore. Gold extraction in 0.8\u00a0M ammonia and 0.1\u00a0M thiosulphate solution after 24\u00a0h increased from 69% without pre-treatment to 81%, 84%, 90% and 94% respectively after 1, 3, 7 and 22\u00a0h pre-treatment. The consumption of sodium thiosulphate was 2.37\u00a0kg/t after 24\u00a0h leaching without pre-treatment, but was negligible after over 1\u00a0h oxidative ammonia pre-treatment. A counter-current leaching process was conducted in the leaching of the sulphide ore. The fresh leachant still gave higher leaching rates in contact with the pre-leached ore, while the pre-used leachant had significantly lower leaching kinetics and overall gold extraction in contact with the fresh ore. This 2-step counter-current leaching process proved that the leachant, other than the passivation, was the determinant factor causing the gold leaching rates to decrease after a certain time of leaching. The findings enable the thiosulphate leaching of high sulphide containing gold ores to be more efficient at lower thiosulphate consumption following the oxidative ammoniacal pre-treatment.",

Analysis of the chalcopyrite region of each sample indicates that exposure to pH 9 for 30\u00a0min when bornite is present results in a decreased concentration of hydrophobic polysulfide species (from 43% to 36% of the total S 2p spectrum). In addition to this decrease in hydrophobic species, there is an increase in the amount of hydrophilic sulfate on the surface, from trace amounts to 3%. For those samples leached at pH 1 there was a small decrease in the amount of polysulfide species (43% to 39%), but also a slight increase in disulfide species (16% to 19%) indicating an alteration to the oxidation process at low pH in the presence of bornite.",

All existing theoretical models of mineral flotation are based on the fundamental assumption that liquid flow around the bubble is both fore-and-after asymmetric in a vertical orientation and left-and-right symmetric in a horizontal orientation.

     "abstract": "In the UG2 ore (Bushveld Complex, South Africa) flotation, normally more than 3% of the gangue minerals, principally chromite with talc and pyroxene, report to the concentrate diluting the PGM recovery and contributing to subsequent processing costs. Previous studies have identified residual talc-like layers on orthopyroxene surfaces in Merensky ore flotation contributing to inadvertent flotation of relatively large particles (20\u2013150\u00a0\u00b5m) of this mineral. Chromite (75\u2013150\u00a0\u00b5m) from flotation of UG2 ore has been similarly examined. Statistical comparison of ToF-SIMS analysis of particles from concentrate and tails reveals no significant difference in Cu, Pb, Ni and collector (IBX and DTP) signals between these streams but surface exposure of Mg and Si is favoured in the concentrate. The flotation rate of coarse chromite correlates with the exposures of magnesium and silicon in patches on the chromite surface; higher exposures give earlier flotation. Conversely, there is a negative correlation with signals corresponding to the chromite surface, i.e. Cr, Fe, Al. Flotation of chromite without collector has confirmed this statistical discrimination. Hydrophobic talc-like residual layers, similar to those found on orthopyroxene surfaces, probably from partial alteration, explain this flotation mechanism.",

     "abstract": "In the present study, Discrete Element Method (DEM) technique was applied to model the fracture behavior of a single spherical and cubic rock in a laboratory jaw crusher. The rocks studied were modeled as granular assemblies located between two jaws, and their fracture mechanism was studied. To verify the obtained results, the spherical and cubic specimens produced from Dokoohak Limestone and Dehbeed Granite were studied and the energy applied by the jaws was compared to those of the fracture energy estimated by the single particle breakage analysis. There is fairly good agreement between the energy acquired from the DEM model and the single particle fracture energy of the spherical rocks. It appears that DEM is a suitable method for predicting the crushing energy of the spherical rocks in the jaw crusher. The fracture behavior of the crushed rocks was examined and compared by the results obtained from the DEM model. The tensile mode of fracture occurring in the spherical rocks is well presented by the discrete element modeling. However, the DEM technique is not capable of modeling the delamination mode occurring in the cubic rocks.",

     "abstract": "High arsenic levels in nickel sulphide concentrates can often present technical and environmental problems at the smelter. In some ores a flotation separation between the nickel sulphides and the arsenide minerals is required in order to meet smelter specifications for arsenic. There is very little information in the literature about such separations and the flotability of nickel arsenides in general. Data are presented here from a single mineral flotation investigation into the flotability of niccolite (NiAs), one of the key nickel arsenide minerals present in nickel sulphide ores in Australia.Niccolite is only weakly flotable with xanthate collector at pH 9 and this behavior is independent of the grinding environment. This suggests that high arsenic levels in nickel concentrates are not due to niccolite flotation, but are more likely to be due to flotation of more floatable arsenic-bearing minerals such as gersdorffite. Cyanide diminishes the poor recovery of niccolite further.",
